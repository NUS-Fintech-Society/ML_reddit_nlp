15-02-01,2ue7ab,Roth Brokerage Trading,"I like to trade relatively frequently in my non-retirement account. Regarding my trading I do it mainly for shorter term plays and some event driven ideas. In addition I also maintain some longer positions. That being said with many of my trades, they will be taxed at short term cap gains rates along with income. While I have been doing well, as many of you know these tax liabilities really eat at your returns.
My thought is why not trade actively in my Roth, leave earnings in there and take principle (my contributions) out as needed. I use my non-retirement as a aggressive pseudo savings account to keep money in and trade. I understand that is not good in terms of financial planning purposes but I have cash reserves outside of the brokerage account, and with the strategies I have been using am also fully ready to lose all my capital if it were to happen.
Three main issues I see are the fact that I could not write off losses if realized in the roth, contribution limits, and earnings will need to stay in there which is part of the plan to build the account over time.
I have been thinking about this for sometime now, and plenty people probably already do it. Has anyone done this before as a way to trade actively and try to minimize tax liabilities? I would also appreciate any other drawbacks you may see beyond what I have covered. Looking forward to hearing from you all.",1

15-02-02,2uj4xa,Options - Straddle on USO - How To,"So oil is hovering around the 50 dollar range for Crude/Brent. Let's say I wanted to place a straddle on this... USO is at 18 dollars now. 

I have never placed an options trade before, so I'm trying to figure it all out. 

Let's say I'm confident that it will move to the extremes in either direction, which is what one would use a straddle for. I would pick the furthest date out as the expiry date, according to my thoughts at the moment. Why bother thinking about a month from now? Let's say two years. Something will play out by then. 

So... 

As of right now, (1) call option on USO, for 18 strike price, on January of 2017 expiry, costs 3.6 bucks. (1) put option on USO, strike price 18, expiry January 2017, costs 3.24. 

USO is now... 18.27. 

Therefore... Let's say I have ten grand to invest. 

(1500) long call options at 3.6 = $5400

(1500) long put options at 3.24 = $4860

USO would have to go over... 21.60 for me to break even on the long call, and what, 24.84 to be breakeven on the whole thing. 

On the other hand... USO would have to go under 12 to be positive for the the whole thing, under 15 to be positive on the puts. 

Other than placing the order, do I need to have some sort of margin to cover the underlying? I thought these types of options simply expire worthless at the end of the January 2017 date. Therefore I wouldn't get a ""margin call"" at any point, I'm just long some contracts. I wouldn't go on margin to place these trades. This is really my biggest question. 

I'm also thinking this straddle seems expensive, as I don't anticipate oil going from 50 a barrel to.... 35 a barrel to make the puts worthwhile. But hey, just me asking Reddit here, not on the wisdom of the trade, but the execution and really whether I need anything else than the 10 grand to place the orders as described above. 

Thanks! ",20

15-02-02,2ukok7,ATVI is going to go up this week. My unscientific analysis,"So I'm still new to the stock market but I am an Econ major and I've been into games for quite a while.  I have hundreds of friends on battle.net so it's sort of my niche and I've been reading every article and playing just about every game.  

My two cents on Activision Blizzard:
I'm going to omit Call of Duty + Destiny because they have been beaten to death in articles.  There is plenty of info out there if you want to go further in depth.  But long story short,  CoD did well but it's suffering from franchise fatigue and has certainly peaked already.  Destiny was controversial but sold well and the DLC seems to have been selling decently.  #'s are not available though, so it's anyone's guess.

Hearthstone is an incredibly hot ticket right now.  Sure it's free to play but I know plenty of people who have dumped hundreds into the new expansion pack lately.   It's going to shock people how much of a cash cow this game turns out to be.  At least in the short run.  I think it's long term potential is limited as the barrier to entry makes it intimidating for new players.  

World of Warcraft is having a resurgence of players.  Do a little research on the number of people logging in daily (it's out there) and it's pretty obvious this latest expansion pack has brought a lot of old players back in.  This is another ace in the hole for Blizzard.  

Lastly, Heroes of the Storm recently went into ""Beta"" and Blizzard has been selling entry for 40 bucks.  A large #of my friends list has been logging in and this game is 100% completely off the radar.  Not to mention plenty of the people I have been playing with have been dropping $ to unlock more heroes.   Again, this revenue is not even being considered by analysts as far as I can tell.  

My last point, check Gamestop (GME)+ Electronic Arts (EA) over the last two weeks.  And pay attention to Take Two's earnings tomorrow.  
Interactive entertainment is rolling right now.  And ATVI has some really solid products.  I don't know how I feel about them in the long run.  But I do believe there are plenty of reason to expect a nice bump come Friday.  

I'm curious to know how you guys feel about it.  I have put pretty much everything I have into it.  So lord help me if I am wrong about this.  But hey, that's what WSB is all about right?",4

15-02-03,2um6h3,Leveraged ETF Trading,"I have been working on implementing an event driven leveraged etf strategy for trading in my brokerage account. I understand that these can be extremely volatile and are for trading, not investing. Leveraged ETF's also can have issues with tracking error, liquidity and the fact that they recalculate every day. However, part of my reason for trading these is two fold. I have been denied for margin trading which would have allowed me to increase my buying power. While one cannot correlate the leverage provided by these ETFs directly with margin, it is a way to get leverage. Secondly, currently I can only trade covered calls and use protective puts so it makes relatively difficult outside of these leveraged ETF's to get the right to sell through something like a long put. Also while I wouldn't want it to happen, I am fully aware that I can lose all my principal as I make these trades, I have a very long time horizon and risk tolerance. I follow my account very closely through the trading day, something IMO everyone should do if you are trading leveraged ETFs. For now I have been buying some leveraged VIX products in addition to my longer term individual stock positions. Generally this has worked well as the VIX often moves up on down days (but not always). This offers some coverage for my long positions but I wouldn't say it's the most efficient way to hedge. 

 I would appreciate any insight you may have on these if you have traded them before  - 

I like to have a solid plan before going into any trade. Setting a target exit price before entering the trade helps take the emotion out of this which I often do by placing stops anywhere from 5%-8% depending on the security. For those that have actively traded these leveraged products, how do you determine a reasonable sell stop price?  With these things moving into the double digits percentage wise on some days its been tough finding an appropriate stop level  with the volatile nature of these. Again, I think it really comes down to the leveraged ETF you are trading, but I want to hear from you.

One other benefit I have noticed, maybe it is just general knowledge, is that sectors tend to trend stronger than individual stocks which opens up some interesting opportunities. Generally these leveraged ETF's tend to have exposure to a specific sector benchmark and sometimes even just an index. Have any of you constructed a portfolio of just leveraged etf's? To me it wouldn't seem very reasonable doing this but I wanted to know if anyone has done this. I am leaning towards keeping about 50% in a broad based ETF or fund, and using the rest of my funds to trade these so I am not committing my entire capital base towards very volatile products.

Any feedback or personal experiences would be much appreciated. I look forward to hearing from you all.

15-02-03,2ulbno,"A historical note about ""calling a bottom"" for oil","Most of us remember the 2008 oil crash. Considering the attention being paid to the 12-14% bounce off the lows for WTI in the past couple days, I felt that some historical perspective might be instructive (obviously 2008 is not the only, or even the best, historical parallel - but the data is the most accessible).

All charts are in log scale. Y-axis is the front month WTI futures contract.

[Here is our situation now.](http://i.imgur.com/BYIkFyy.png) 12-14% off the lows. Some on this sub have taken this to be the bottom (and therefore a buy signal).

[2008: 35% off the lows. Was it the bottom?](http://i.imgur.com/h5FRVJh.png)

[Nope.](http://i.imgur.com/s7KjAGd.png)

[Here is how long the recovery actually took.](http://i.imgur.com/CyLBqwU.png)
I think it's important to observe that at no point would you have ""missed the boat"" by waiting a couple of weeks for the trend to establish itself. A 7% up day may feel like a big deal, but these are big moves over a period of many months.

Also, I am relatively confident that, for compelling macro reasons, the recovery will be slower this time around. I believe that the 2008 oil crash was due mainly to general economic chaos (as they say, correlations go to 1 in a crisis), but the industrial value of oil quickly reasserted itself - this time it is a matter of global supply and demand. The imbalance will resolve itself eventually (actually, in a sense, the price slide is restoring equilibrium) but the supply side of the equation will probably take more than a few months to properly adjust.

Finally, history tells us this: if you are an investor buying *durable* oil sector companies during the cyclical lows, over the next few years you will likely be rewarded for the extra risk you are assuming.

If you are instead a commodity speculator greedy enough to try to hit the exact bottom in oil, the market will straighten you out.

15-02-03,2unffk,VTI: Arguably The Best Replacement for SPY?,"Did this post's title sound insanely pedestrian to you? Or am I just too aware of Bogle-friendly investing priciples?


Please permit me to rant about this pointless ""analysis"" with that very title:


http://seekingalpha.com/article/2851236-vti-arguably-the-best-replacement-for-spy


This ""Colorado Wealth Management Fund"" post on SeekingAlpha (ugh) compares Vanguard Total U.S. Market as a replacement for another nearly-as-low-cost passive S&amp;P 500 Index fund.


* SPY is the 500 largest US companies
* VTI is the 3700 largest US companies


Both are market-cap weighted, passive, low expense, ETFs. That's it. SPY a big boring S&amp;P index fund. VTI is the exact same as SPY, but with many smaller companies added onto it, taking up about 20% due to market cap weighting. It is like this guy is offering this as a total novel idea and a potentially dramatic step, and thus requiring a lot of analysis.


&gt;""I'll be performing a substantial portion of my analysis along the lines of modern portfolio theory, so my goal is to find ways to minimize costs while achieving diversification to reduce my risk level ... I start with an ANOVA table ... The standard deviation is great. For VTI it is .758%. For SPY, it is 0.736% for the same period. So, both have very similar levels of volatility.""


Basically, if I wanted to make low-cost, passive investing look complicated in order to get clients, I would write exactly this. It almost feels like trolling. I mean if you wanted to provide actually useful advice to passive investing noobs, you wouldn't use hundred-dollar fancy terms like ANOVA and standard deviation for any reason other than making the dead simple look like a lot of alchemy that you had to slave over.


&gt;""The ETF is posting .05% for both gross and net expense ratios. That is absolutely incredible given that the ETF holds 3812 different securities.""


No, it's not. It is an extremely widely-held fund, and it requires effectively zero management.


&gt;""When measuring standard deviation of returns, VTI looks slightly more risky than SPY, but that is a cost of including smaller cap equities""


Oh, no sh-t? That is what adding small &amp; mid cap groups to blue chips will always do. Slightly more diversity, slightly more risk, and slightly more return over the long haul.


&gt;""The ETF is at a .01% premium to NAV currently. That isn't large enough to matter.""


That difference is so minute as to be meaningless, e.g. nitpicking this as opposed to focusing on re-balancing or asset allocation. It reminds me of the phrase ""rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic"" with regards to magnitude of impact.

The way I look at it was it hasn't been this bad since 2008 and it HAS to rebound eventually. 

I use TD to trade and Google to track them in a portfolio. see the link below. 

I evaluated about 30+ stocks, all from relative risk/reward, potential gains from their previous 52w high to dividend %, TD market ratings. I invested in one stock that wasn't OIL as a mistake and took a $300 loss and the other stock I sold wasn't acting accordingly to the others and their gain/loss. 

I am not guessing on these stocks, all these specifically lost shares when the market all together dropped. Redflags were when the company had a shitty YEAR trend, bad profits, bad ratings. 

There was a few that I thought would do good like HSE (husky) because they are consistent. The risk wasn't as great as others so I steered towards the stocks I thought had more to gain over the next 6-12 months. 

I expect a 30-60% return on most/all of my picks. My total invested amount is $30,500.00. All in CA funds, and the two I did sell off I re-invested into CPG and BNE.

sell at 10, re buy at 8-9. with the amount I've invested I think taking a great win and being on the bench for a day won't hurt. See the punters get rocked and go back in to throw another 50 yarder.

After an release by famed fund Blackrock, Inc which revealed that since September 2014 the firm has gone from a 0.001% stake to a 5% stake in ITT Educational Services, ESI stock has leapt massively.
The options market on this stock has reflected this high volatility potential for a long time in this hotly contested stock. Multiple factors are being looked to by the 45%+ short interest as their hotbutton issues. The Company is currently facing a Wells Notice which may result in the educational giant being completely shut down by their Government Oversight agency.  

Much uncertainty surrounds ESI's business performance itself after failing to file their GAAP financial statements with the SEC for months on end now, word on the street is that auditors and other accountants employed by ITT Educational are working around the clock to meet the standard earnings report date for the Company which typically lands in the last two weeks of February.  

This won't be a typical earnings announcement. The Firm also must file a delinquent statement for along with the typical statement. This will give the Street a lot of information to chew on, but simply, ESI investors are facing a long period of earnings that simply having been reported. The financials are being gambled on via both sides with the aforementioned 45%+ short interest on the one hand and the new 5% stake purchasd by Blackrock on the other.  

The options market has heated up with today's massive jump in price. Last time this kind of action happened in one day the price per share jumped a further 20% on the next trading day.  

Market participants are watching ESI with close eyes but the question remains -- will there be money to be made still by the time the late February report is made? Will the bull case for ESI return or will it even out after squeezing the shorts?

I believe that oil will bounce back sooner rather than later.  There seems to be a small jump today.  A long call option would give me the possible biggest reward.  I was looking at those options.  Because oil is so volatile is there good times and bad tines to buy options ?  How can you tell when the volatility has dropped enough to make the purchase price reasonable?  Is low volume an issue if you plan on holding an option for a long time or till the period is over ?  Assuming there is enough volume or interest in an option is it acceptable to buy a call option, see the bid/ask rise in a few days and sell it making profit on the bid/ask price change ?

beginner to intermediate investor here.  I ran into a couple of scenarios for the first time, so any guidance would be
greatly appreciated.

Scenario 1

I opened put options on 1/13/2015 for ECOM and was subsequently assigned the shares on 1/17/2015.
In the meantime, ECOM greatly reduced guidence which saw a ~52% drop in the price of the stock.

I currently still hold the stock and have not sold.

There are several law firms saying they will be preparing a class action against ECOM (links below)

I've contacted one of these firms and received a response of'[my] losses are minimal and will not be considered the lead plantiff'


My questions are, 

What are the chances of compensation from these class actions in my position, perhaps I do not qualify because I received stock through option.
If I do qualify, how do I qualify to be a part of the class action? (I'm assuming I have to sell and realize loss and somehow join the class action?)
And generally, what to expect or what recourse do I have in this scenario

Scenario 2

V has a dividend ex date of 2-11.
If I have call options for V, when do I have to execute to also receive credit for the dividend (a little confused on settling of options and date of record)

15-02-03,2up1qn,"Motif with r/investing's 30-year picks","So the other day, /u/mimichicken posted a question [If you had to buy today 20 stocks which you couldn't sell until 30 years later, which stocks would you buy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2rxs9d/if_you_had_to_buy_today_20_stocks_which_you/) that I enjoyed looking at. So today, out of boredom, I did a very primitive analysis of the comments, and built a portfolio on [Motif Investing](http://www.motifinvesting.com) which had the top 20 stocks from the comments.

I named my [Motif r/investing](https://www.motifinvesting.com/motifs/rinvesting-zfoe1Q19) (hopefully that's not intrusive to this sub).

What I mean by ""Primitive Analysis"" is that I literally copied every comment, plopped it into Excel, turned the names of companies into ticket symbols (unless they were already in a ticker symbol), combined like companies (BRK.A and BRK.B were combined, as well as GOOG and GOOGL, I think those were the only two) and then went exclusively off of the number of times they were recommended overall. I didn't use any echos (people saying ""Yeah, this is a good list!"") or karma (which I kind of wish I had done, but I didn't have an easy way to do that). Then I weighted each of the 20 based on the number of times they were mentioned. Luckily, there were only 20 stocks that happened to be picked 3+ times, so that worked out well.

I am sure you can analyze those comments a number of different ways (karma, echoing sentiment, etc.), but this is how I built this particular [Motif.](https://www.motifinvesting.com/motifs/rinvesting-zfoe1Q19)

Feel free to check it out if you're interested.

(Full disclosure, I DO know that if anyone buys that Motif I get like $1 or something for it. I am not doing this to hype anything though. Just thought it might be nice for people to be able to check out how r/investing would perform as a whole as a long-term investor.)

15-02-04,2up5mu,Will a new product launch almost always cause a stock to go up?,"Hi I'm new to investing, and haven't really committed to anything serious yet, just doing as much reading as possible, but I had a couple of questions:

When an anticipated product is released to the public, is the stock price almost always expected to go up? Or have investors already purchased shares in the company months ahead of time, like when the product is first announced? 

Example: When Blackberry released the Z10 product line-up to Telecommunication stores, many of my co-workers and friends that I knew made a decent return in a short amount of time expecting demand for the device to be great.The product sold really well, and then dropped off shortly after.

But then I see other instances like with Take-Two Interactive(makers of Grand theft Auto series), that the stock doesn't seem to jump when they release an anticipated title (the impact seems to be several months beforehand), and seemed to have more of an impact during the holiday seasons, or when their results exceed their forecasts(which was just announced today)

I guess what I'm asking is, how does one learn to ride the wave of a stock when an anticipated product is being released or announced? How early do you have to buy in? Is it too risky thinking you'll get ahead of the curve? Any advice or words of caution are appreciated.

Last June my 401K was transferred from the Vanguard Target Retirement 2045 fund to the Target Retirement 2045 Trust II Fund. My employee I suppose made the decision. I guess this is a good thing as the the trust fund has a lower expense ratio.

In the old fund, I got a dividend payment every December. Every year it got bigger. This year I didn't get one. I figured it was because I am in the trust now. I called to find out why. The vanguard guy said he can't tell me when or if I will ever get dividend payments because it's up to the mutual fund to pay them out or I guess reinvest the money in the fund?

Last year my payment was about $700 for about a $40,000 account. It's a bummer not seeing one this year. I feel like I am losing, but I'm sure that's not the case. If they are just keeping my dividends does that mean I should expect a slightly higher growth rate than if they were paying them out???

Near the money? Out of the money? Multiple contracts?  Do you play spreads to harvest premiums or reduce contract prices? When do you sell?


My general strategy is to buy fairly far in the money contracts that have near 75-90% intrinsic value. Usually I will buy contracts that expire in no less than a month. Typically then if the stock drops (or rises) to near the strike price I sell the stock to get the remaining premium and take my losses. If the contract price rises I watch the price action and news daily to desired decide my exit point often with setting ~30% trailing stop losses and occasionally selling some when the gains become very good. 

Occasionally with lower priced stocks (where the premium/intrinsic value % ratio for at the money is often higher than for higher priced stocks) I will buy out of the money contracts that expire in 2-3 months. These are usually smaller positions as the risk (and reward) are greater. 

Any thoughts or questions on my investment strategies are welcome as well as sharing your own strategies.

* 17% - PID (PowerShares International Dividend Achievers™ Portfolio)
* 10% - SCHA (Schwab U S Small Cap ETF)

15-02-04,2uqzxx,"The Danish Krone-Euro peg, and negative mortgage interest in wake of the broken Franc-Euro peg.","Danish News have been running this story nationally for some weeks now, and things are getting crazy. Basically currency speculation in the danish Krone is threatening the Crown-Euro peg - If the peg is removed, and the danish krone goes free float, it will probably rise like a rocket, like we saw with the swizz franc. Which just puts on more pressure. Here are some excerpts and some sources:


&gt; Denmark has certainly taken some unusual steps to defend the krone. It surprisingly suspended sales of all government debt to close down an avenue for investors to buy its currency.

&gt; This is after it tried cutting interest rates and buying up its own currency. The Danish central bank has pushed its interest rate deeper into negative territory to a record low of -0.5% after three rate cuts in two weeks - the last being triggered by the Swiss giving up their three-year euro cap.

&gt; So, Denmark's borrowing cost - the yield on 10-year government bonds - has dropped to the lowest in the world, apart from Switzerland which has a negative yield. Were it to borrow, Denmark would pay only 0.16%, which is lower than Germany at 0.31% and even Japan at 0.36%. Germany's borrowing costs, by the way, fell below Japan's for the first time today, so it looks worrying as the eurozone's benchmark bond is experiencing deflationary pressures.


...


&gt; However, a positive side effect for borrowers of the negative interest rate is that for the first time, a Danish lender, Nordea Kredit, is reportedly paying mortgage holders to borrow money by charging a negative interest rate. But others are not following suit as it's unclear how to handle a negative interest rate.

&gt; Indeed, there are calls now in Europe to fashion IT systems and discuss how to manage negative interest rates. There's an estimated $4 trillion of sovereign debt, including even 10-year Swiss bonds, which have negative yields.

&gt; The Danish central bank, Nationalbanken, said it bought foreign currency worth 106.3 billion Danish kroner ($16.34 billion) last month as part of its market interventions.

&gt; The sudden rise in its market activity reflects Nationalbanken’s efforts to counter the upward pressure on the krone as investors move funds to Denmark seeking better returns than they can get in the eurozone.


...


&gt;  Nationalbanken seeks to hold the euro’s exchange rate within 2.25% either above or below 7.46038 kroner to keep inflation low and provide stability for exporters.

&gt; Denmark has cut its deposit rate to minus 0.5% and suspended issuance of bonds by the government to deflect foreign investments away from the country. By cutting the supply of bonds, it raises prices and lowers yields, making Danish bonds less appealing to investors.



...



&gt; Analysts at Swedish bank SEB said Switzerland gave up the franc ceiling after selling Swiss francs for the equivalent of 80% of gross domestic product, while Denmark has so far sold Danish kroner amounting to around 30% of GDP.

Here’s where the conundrum lies --GoPro appears to be a simple one-product consumer electronics company with a successful product line.

 However, GoPro’s management insists that the company is a media business, rather than a consumer hardware enterprise. It all boils down to whether the investor is willing to believe in the media growth of the company- if they do, they'll see another Apple story(first the iPhone, and now its hosting Apple Music Awards), or a Red Bull(product first, then media empire), etc.

The media end never comes first, its the brand and product first.  So at what stage do you think GPRO is at right now? Overbaked and overvalued as a camera maker? Or a media company, in its fertile stages of its seed?

If you believe that, then walk with me, hand in hand, into the land of $55 and $60 calls, expiring April 17...they may not be cheap, but you may end up more frugal if you spend the good dollar now, or keep waiting for the next ship to sail from this markets harbor....

15-02-04,2usu1p,Day 2 of the UWTI rollercoaster.,"http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/2umg07/im_touching_my_toes_into_uwti/

I placed a buy order for 1800 UWTI @ 3.00 when I saw that the price was falling this morning and was pleased to find it filled, esp considering I made my exit at $4.00 from an initial entry of $3.60.

I'm pretty fortunate because I placed my initial limit to $3.50 last night when the price was at $3.85, then cancelled it to $3.30, then moved it again in the morning to $3.10 when the price dropped to $3.45, and then $3.00 before I decided to head out to lunch and came back to find it filled. I'd be kicking myself if I had let that initial $3.50 order stand. 

My advice to everyone is to be liberal with your limit orders when it comes to these volatile assets, they carry a huge amount of risk with them so as with any asset, but especially leveraged ETF/ETNs, make sure you're buying them at a price that you feel is better than fair and have reserve capital so you're not as bothered when the price potentially tanks 20-30% in a single day. 

I plan to hold for the coming week unless another highly volatile growth period occurs tomorrow then I'll let go of 1/2-2/3 of my shares to close in on some hard gains before another correction occurs.

As I stated before, I think we found the bottom in terms of price, but I by no means believe that this will be a straight shot upward (If only!). 

I think there is a VERY good chance UWTI can drop by another 30% or down to the $2.00 range so I'm not putting everything into it right away. I really hope it doesn't, but I plan to position myself to benefit at least a little bit incase it does. 

Unfortunately, this is the second to last trade I can do for this week as I am now at my PDT threshold for my account, I have one more left which I will save for selling in case the market shoots up again like it did the day before, I plan to hold for the coming week otherwise, don't plan to buy any more shares unless the price drops below $2.50 at the least.

I'm an Australian citizen and resident who has a bit of money tucked away in the ASX, but I'd like to take a few k (really only 2) and take a few gambles on the NYSE and NASDAQ. Unfortunately most US brokers don't accept foreign applicants.

Does anyone know which US online brokers will:

* Accept Australians

* Have pretty standard commissions (&lt;$8)

* minimum startup balance &lt; $500

* accept ACH transfers from us domestic banks despite non-residency

TD ameritrade, Optionshouse and Schwab don't accept aussies specifically (where did this hate come from?)

Other than that my only luck was with Firstrade, but they won't allow me to use ACH transfers for foreign accounts to my domestic US account, meaning a federal wire roundtrip that will fuck me over worse than any commissions.

I'm the least fussed about the client, I just want to make a few trades (and lose money) on all these exciting stocks that aren't on the ASX. Any help or direction would be greatly appreciated!",1

I am new to this and have read the sidebar. I am finally starting contributions to my 401K. My company has a plan with Fidelity. However, I have no idea which of these funds to choose. I thought it would be able to choose a simple target fund like ""2050 Retirement Plan"" but it looks to be more complicated.

I had a limit set to $3.60 and it filled!! I'm pretty stoked.

A part of me wanted to cancel the order and keep the profits to see if it would go higher, but I'm keeping my word from day 1 stating that if there are days with greater than 10% gain, I will sell and wait at least a day or two before I buy back in which I knew from the start was going to take a lot of discipline.

The biggest challenge for me is to not be greedy and happy with walking away with these gains while I have them. Too many times I've held volatile assets only to end up in the red due to my fear/greed causing me to go against my better judgement.

I'm going to set my order back below to buy back in and if it fills great, if not then I'll figure out what to do from there, whether to keep jumping in and out of UWTI or move it into an oil company like GDP or OAS. Maybe even HAL or XOM so I can just get some sleep and focus on other things in my life.",2

I am thinking of buying into this closed-ended mutual fund that I was turned on to by my families financial adviser. 

I have about $2,000 that I want to invest, so not a ton. but I want to do something other than just have it sit in a savings account--and i see this as a good way to have a diverse portfolio with out having to buy 13 different stocks and pay 13 commission fees, etc. 

I don't really know a lot about Mutual Funds, and from what I have read, closed-ended funds are becoming more rare. 

from someone who knows more about this, are there any redflags when you look at it? I would invest though E-trade, and they say that there are no fee's to invest, but on the webpage for the mutual fund, it seems like there are all kinds of fees that come out of this. It also looks like there is a close date, when I will no longer be able to purchase shares. 

Anyway, if you have a second and feel like giving some feedback/insight, I would appreciate. 

I am going to continue to research this procedure before buying in, but all feedback is helpful.

It seemed crazy at first but after a little thought, it seems like Amazon could benefit from a move like this.  It seems like one weakness that amazon has for its own products is that it lacks marketability because they don't have a prominent resource for potential customers to try their product before they buy it ( please correct me if i'm wrong).  Is it really that far fetched to think that this could be a reality and what kind of deal could they strike for a potential buyout that could make buying radioshack at about .08 a share a good idea?

When profits trend down, the dividend payout ratio can easily trend up. If you keep an eye on the direction of quarterly earnings, you’ll have a good early warning system in place. It’s an easy way to get a feel for the direction of the dividend payout ratio.

Dividends are paid from a company’s cash flow. So check out the free cash flow, which is how much money is available to pay a dividend after the other bills have been paid… salaries, marketing, operations, the whole works.

Here are the 3 dividend stocks you need to dump…

The Wendy’s Co. $WEN
Paychex $PAYX
National Bank Holdings Corp. $NBHC
Each stock’s ugly dividend payout ratio is ugly.

More than 60%.

But take a closer look and you’ll find even more good reasons why the fuse is about to blow, and the dividend is at risk.

Given the above, I'm both curious on how to invest in TIPS and I'm curious on this sub's thoughts on the markets in general. Specifically related to TIPS, is my best bet just to wait until the next auction for 5-year? If so, is it hard to buy TIPS in an auction? Do they get bid up?

15-02-06,2v0q79,Athleisure Discussion/Speculation : NKE vs UA vs ADDYY,"With the exception of Adidas, the ""athleisure"" sector had an amazing 2014 with lots of different stories. This is an exciting area to me and I wanted to speculate on where it might be headed. Disclaimer - this post will be almost entirely speculation so turn around now if you don't want to join in.

Nike:

* Impressive growth in areas they already dominate (basketball, running, etc)
* Increasing profit margins with more direct to consumer sales
* Slight drag due to foreign exchange rates, dollar doesn't seem to be getting any weaker in the near term.
- Killed their fuelband/wearables for now, seems likely that they will take Apple's lead into the future.
- Top notch design over the last few years, really innovated what a running shoe looks like (seriously compare the asics lineup with the nike flyknit lineup), innovative tech over the years such as air, flywire, flyknit - its easy to see that the rest of industry is chasing them in this regard.

UA:

* One of the best stocks of 2014, amazing growth story, where do we go from here?
* Growth has been explosive in the US, but will they be able to convert a European Adidas fan or a Nike fan in Asia?
* To go with the above point, they are very focused in Football right now, practically non-existent in soccer though, lagging far behind in baseball and basketball as well (although they are extremely lucky to have Steph Curry, pretty much guaranteed MVP this year). Soccer seems like a long shot for them, Basketball growth seems more likely but they need to develop brands with their stars. Jordan, Kobe, Lebron, KD - all have huge brands cultivated under Nike and any future megastar is going to want the same. Steph curry just got his first signature shoe. Long way to go.
* Purchased MyFitnessPal and Endomondo - building a very exciting, OS agnostic fitness platform with impressive user numbers already. Great move, but are they really going to come out ahead of NKE here? Nike and Apple are very close, Tim Cook sits on the Nike board, Apple looks to have a dominant position in wearables before even releasing their watch, this duo will be a dominant force in health and fitness tracking.
* What are they doing now that really sets them apart? I don't deny the brand is extremely hot, but where are they setting themselves apart instead of copying Nike? Before the fitness app purchases I haven't seen anything unique yet.

Adidas:

* Slaughtered this year, exchange rates really hurt, World Cup not giving the boost they wanted, EU and Russia really dragging them down.
* CEO admits mistakes, vows to spend a huge amount of money signing hundreds of athletes and advertising heavily in the US this year.
* Top Nike designers jumping ship and joining Adidas, as well as big signings outside of athletics - Kanye West, Pharrell Williams, etc. Say what you want about Kanye, but he is arguably the most well known person in the world designing shoes and apparel right now, his work with NKE sold out instantly and was highly coveted. His work with Adidas will have a much more broad reach, we'll see how those numbers might translate on the balance sheet soon. Adidas also has a long history collaborating with other fashion designers (same with Nike), whereas UA has nothing like this that I've seen.

I have long positions in NKE and AAPL so that's what I'm betting on here, but I'm thinking about buying some ADDYY because of how badly they've been beaten down. I think the brand is still very strong all over the world and is poised for a comeback, although maybe not immediate due to the high price tag they may pay in the short term to earn back that market share. I like UA, but I'm not convinced that the next couple years will be so great, in line with their recent guidance downgrade.

What are your thoughts? How does LULU play into all of this? How will the sector as a whole perform this year?",1
15-02-06,2v0qvh,Inflation and Tax on Securities?,"Hey guys, 

Quick question. What is the proper way of adjusting for taxes and inflation on gains from the market? 

I invested in 2010, and from the research I've done, it appears the cumulative inflation rate was 8.3%. 

I am in the lowest tax bracket (student with low income) and so it appears my capital gains tax is about 5% with another 2% from state income taxes. 

Unadjusted I've made 38.63% since 2010 overall. How do I use these numbers to make an adjusted percentage?

15-02-06,2uzev8,"Wired Magazine: If We Want to Keep the Gadgets Coming, Let’s Mine Greenland","Saw this on Wired. An interesting, albeit difficult method to prevent a supply stream interruption.  First couple of parapgraphs are below.

http://www.wired.com/2015/02/gadget-rare-metals/?mbid=social_twitter

""Chemists call them lanthanides; you know them as rare earth metals. But by any name, they behave in ways that other matter simply can’t: They have piles of electrons, but unlike most elements they don’t stash them tidily, filling up one orbital shell before moving up to the next. They prefer, instead, to toss some up to higher levels, orbitals that go unused by many metals, like dusty closet shelves onto which you have tippy-toed shoeboxes of old love letters. This makes them act … odd.

And it makes them essential for modern life. The US imports 10,000 tons of refined rare earth metals a year, and globally we consumed well over 100,000 metric tons in 2011. In the ground, rare earths are usually bound up with radioactive elements like uranium and thorium, which makes mining and refining them expensive. Plus, they are unevenly distributed throughout the planet’s crust. (Hence the term rare, though hard to get would be more accurate.)

Global supplies of rare earths are more uneven still: China controls more than 95 percent of rare-earth-metal exports. That could change though, not least because China is about to run out. Current projections estimate China’s domestic appetite for rare earth metals will top 130,000 metric tons as early as this year, a number exceeding China’s current total rare-earth-metal exports. Even with existing stockpiles and untapped reserves within its borders, it will be difficult for China to continue to provide the world with an affordable supply of these indispensable elements.

Unfortunately, options for tapping new supplies are extremely limited. In the US, mining operations are finding it difficult to revive dormant mines profitably. In Australia, rare-earth-rich Mount Weld is mired in a political game of hot potato with Malaysia over whether the ore would be refined there and whether the radioactive result would be allowed back into Oz. No, the best possible source for the next batch of squirmy-electroned elements is Greenland.""

I have zero explicit knowledge that would allow me to predict the direction of any changes in price and I don't have access to anything that I would consider to not be public knowledge. I'd like to purchase and hold the stock now regardless of what the execs say.

I don’t think this is worth basing any decisions on, but I found it kind of interesting. Current analyst estimates are lower than these values.  One issue is that this assumes/results in a 10% surprise in Q2 revenue versus projections given.

Even given a more conservative estimate, the yoy growth numbers are very good. Yes, I know that the catch phrase of this sub is ""this is already priced in."" 

EDIT: completely unreliable price projection. If we cut $0.32 from projected EPS, and lower p/e to 14, you get a price of $126. I think this is where the stock should be today. I can see the stock trading in 132-135 range if q2 matches my numbers.

EDIT:

CUBI - growing bank trading close to tangible book led by ex-sovereign CEO Jay Sidu... for those not familiar he grew this from one branch and then sold the thing to Santander.

ASEI - just a stock with a shit load of cash that makes x-ray bomb detection machines.  Business has deteriorated recently but if valued again past year when business was good, it should have 30-50% upside.

LGND - r/stockpick February picks... give a detailed thesis.

EGHT -cloud telephone systems for businesses, huge cost savings to the business because they don't have to allocate resources (i.e. people) to maintain infrastructure.  Growing nicely, makes money... think it can trade at 3x EV/Sales forward multiple which means 15+% upside in forward year.

TWOU - my favorite story in the market... online education platforms for high end university grad programs... they collect 60-70% of all tuition that comes in the door... believe it gets a 6x sales multiple on forward at any point late 2015/ early 2016 which puts the stock at $25.

AWAY - banged down by AirBnb but is the same business model for vacation homes.  has the largest vacation home database.  AWAY grows and makes money, AirBnb hemorrages cash.  They either get taken out at $35-40 or AirBnB announces they are going public and this gets a boost from the comp.

IRBT - outlined story yesterday.

VNOM -special type of MLP that owns RSPP and FANG mineral rights.  They collect a toll every time FANG or RSPP drills with no cost to them.  Dependent on drilling continuing and a highly attractive bet that can pay out nicely.

QFOR - SW company that doesn't report R&amp;D line item and instead puts it into COGS... all products have been developed so margins will expand as they sell more business... think this will trade at a buck by year end as I think they can do 10 mil in EBITDA and get a 10-12 multiple on it.

BCEI - SYRG is the comp which is net cash and held up nicely during energy correction.  Great acreage and should have more juice than SYRG out of the trough given they are 50-50 debt equity.  Just a high quality E&amp;P that can have legs.",29

Anyone care to tell me how to find out what a stock symbol is for a certain company?

Edit:
- As i expected, most people are quite arrogant and like to insult people instead of trying to help them.

- Yes I am quite new to stocks, a little over a year and I'm not going to sit here and trying to pretend I knew everything about everything. That's why you ask question. Either answer the question or gtfo. Its really that simple.

- As for my finances I've turn 20k into 30k in a little over a year so I know how the stock market works, thanks, i don't need your help on that. I expect the same trolls to bash me on that too.

- Anyway. Yes sometimes I come across a company I like and want to invest in their product. And sometime I can't seem to find a ticker symbol for them. such as ""DBrand"" 

- If you think you're some sort of genius for being able to type in a company's name +stock,  and get their ticker.. well you're not. (not insult anyone that suggested to do this, but instead thank you for you help)

- I was simply asking if their is an easier way.

- Thank you for the suggestions of finance.yahoo.com. that place isn't bad. CNBC is a lot better give it a try. 

- The guy that said to add ($), thanks for that tip didn't know about that one.

- But ya, as the stock I am currently interested in is DBrand, and I did all the same tricks you guys mention here before I even posted here and came up with nothing. I have to assume they are a private company.

- You know unless any of the hypocrite's on here can prove me wrong because they are obviously super smart and know so much. like type ""Dbrand"" + stock into Google, dang takes super incredible intelligence right there if you ask me...

1) Interactive brokers - cheapest for guys trading under ~400 shares per trade(0.005 per share) and ~9 option contracts (~.70 per contract). Their futures commission is a bit high for low volume guys ~.85 (doesn't include exchange fees). MIN required for account 10k.

2) Lightspeed - Cheaper than interactive brokers. Traders trading under ~400 shares(.0045 per share) will like them. Options contracts are .60 and future contracts are .60. MIN required for account 10k.

3) Choicetrade - This one is the best for traders who are taking large swing trades with options. You can't beat their 5 dollar base + .15 per contract. MIN required - 2k

4) Just2trade - If you are trading more than 500 shares per trades, you might want to consider them for their low 2.50 per trade fees. Their options commission isn't bad either at 2.50 (base) + .50 per option. MIN required -2k

Are there any US-based online trade brokers that allow you to place several market limit orders without committing the cash until the trade is executed?

For example, if I'm interested in buying $500 worth of stocks A, B, and C with market limit orders but I only have $1000 in my account, most online brokers will only allow me to place two orders.  Is there any broker where I can all three orders and then automatically have any pending transactions be cancelled once my account reaches $0?

15-02-06,2v02cw,How should I approach the SDRL earnings call later this month if I have a position in them?,"So I managed to get in back when they were around $10/share a couple weeks ago and they've enjoyed some nice gains this week on the back of WTI prices, but I'm a little wary of losing the 30% I've made so far in the wake of their Q4 earnings report towards the end of this month. Should I be prepared to liquidate entirely before the call then reinvest afterwards? I don't think anyone really expects them to have anything close to a good quarter, but I feel like the company has good prospects assuming oil starts a steady recovery in earnest by the fall of this year, so I'd like to keep them in my portfolio until next year at least.

Can anyone speak to the efficacy of maintaining a position in a particular company that isn't doing particularly well but playing the earnings call to keep your returns by liquidating/reinvesting before and after? I know that this is a decently risky strategy, but for specific instances (this being one of them) I feel like it has potential to pay off.",1
15-02-06,2v03sz,Thoughts on Apollo Global Management [APO],"Currently searching around for some good undervalued stocks and APO caught my eye.  It's current price is $24.15 and Morningstar's Fair Value estimate gives it a $40.  The current P/E for APO is 16 and the forward P/E is projected at 11.  They have a WHOPPING dividend yield of 11.89%.  The company has a rather narrow economic moat, and I worry about because a majority of their funds are invested in illiquid assets.  2014 was a rather rough year for their earnings and revenues compared to 2012 and 2013, which is why it might be a great opportunity to snag them for their expected rebound -- annual EPS growth for this year is supposed to be up 54.7% from last year and revenues are projected to increase 38.3% (although I'm taking these estimates with a big grain of salt seeing as the analysts have not been too accurate on historical projections.)  Their free cash flows are pretty solid which is a plus.  However, their D/E ratio is 7.5 which is a bit high for me personally.  Their ROE is damn near 25% which is pretty impressive if you ask me.  But yes, I know it could be that high for a variety of reasons (more than likely due to their small equity base).  Please check them out and let me know what you guys think!  Insight is much appreciated!",28

For ex. If I buy a Stock for $100 and it pays 10% dividend for the year let's say, and assuming the stock stays even for the year:

* The stock is now $90 a share (because it paid 10% or $10 dividend) so my balance is down 10%.

* I get $10 for the year from the dividend. But now I have to pay imcome tax on that dividend.

So the way I see this... I had $100 invested. I got $10 in dividend. My account when down to $90 and had to pay tax on the $10. 
So at the end I lost money even when the stock broke even for the year, due to the taxes I had to paid on the dividend.

I spent most of 2014 thinking about what it is that really causes people to trade in a companies shares. The answer was a while in coming. In technical trading there's a ton of indicators you can use. MACD, bollinger bands etc... But, I felt this wasn't quite right. It seemed to me that if I were the only person in the world with technical charts, they might not really help. Of course as with all 'great' ideas I had no data. So I assumed this to be true.

The conclusion I came to was that the root cause of movement was news. So I built a tool to scrape company news, do analysis of said news, and then rate and group the result by it's reliability over time. All of this was spat out 5 minutes before market open.

It worked. A couple of percent a day on the FTSE AIM All Share looks nice. In a completely automated fashion. It advised who to buy/or sell. And assumed that if the target was hit the position was closed at that point even if the target was exceeded. If the forecast target wasn't hit, the position was closed at the closing price. A daily end of day report showed that most of the forecasts outperformed the market. Me, I don't have money to trade, and neither am I interested in the big gamble.

15-02-07,2v2w5k,Understand UK investors expectation on their portfolio management app,"Hi all,

I'm the author of a stock portfolio management app.

Recently, I tries to have some improvement over my current app.

Due to the spirit of ""less is more"", I decide to remove some of the options, which 99% of users don't really care about it.

I do invest in some UK equities. When I want to look on the total share value, I prefer to have the value in pound, rather in pence.

I was wondering, is most of the UK investors having the same behavior of me? If so, I plan to remove an option ""Pence to pound"".

That's mean, if the stock is priced as pence (Not all UK stocks are price in pence, but majority of them are) in London Stock Exchange, my app will automatically show stock value in pound.

For instance, if I bought 200 units of Tesco in London with price 300 pence per unit. My app will display the following information.


Stock buy price = 300 pence

Stock units = 200 units

Stock buy value = 300 pence * 200 units = 600 pound


I was wondering, does most UK investors expect such behavior in their stock portfolio management app? Can I safety remove ""Pence to pound"" conversion option? (Meaning that, my app will always convert pence priced stock value, to pound value)

Please refer to the attachment, on the option I'm planning to remove. (They are highlighted in red rectangle)

15-02-07,2v1hq8,Hypothetical tax treatment of dividends,"So as we all know, dividends are paid out from company profits which are taxed at 25%. Then the investors are taxed 15% (since the tax code changes in 2003?). This amounts to 36.25% effective tax rate across the board for people in all tax brackets.

So I have a ""better dividend tax code"" thought experiment: why not have dividends paid out before corporate tax and then the dividends investors receive are taxed as regular income. Here are the upsides I see:

* The government gets a slightly higher return from highest tax bracket investors. (~39%)
* Companies have a better incentive to pay dividends (?). They can also pay larger dividends!
* The lower and middle class investors have a better incentive to invest money.

Downsides:

* Government gets less tax money from dividends for anyone not in the highest tax bracket. (Hah, the real deal breaker)
* Companies might be influenced by the highest tax bracket to avoid dividends in favor of buy backs or self investment. This could be offset by similar changes to capital gains taxes?

I'd be very interested in the comments of the smart people here. Probably I'm missing something important. (Disclaimer: I'm a novice investor and definitely not a politician. :)",0

I believe this company could  rise significantly in the next ~three years; unless oil and copper prices stay low.  Despite the share price drop, and net loss for FY15, I believe the company will weather the storm because of its size, massive assets, and experience.  Now, everyone hates it, but, in many cases (admittedly not all), that shows the time to buy.  

However, there are risks- here are the most obvious to me:

1.) Copper and oil prices stay low, resulting in lowered revenues and profits for the future

2.)  The impressive 6.63% dividend yield may likely be cut or decreased, which may lower the stock price

3.)  If profits do not rise, their large amount of debt will hinder development  

Overall, my thesis is pretty simple and underdeveloped; I think that the world needs copper and oil, so FCX will rise again soon enough.",6

Mid-2009 I was flat broke with $60k in student loans. Many friends and peers were seriously spooked; they wouldn't have anything to do with investing or the stock market. (Some liquidated! wtf.) I'd just relocated to Ohio for a decent-paying job and seeing the shitty, shitty market I asked myself: *I wonder if I can hit the $16.5 max 401(k) contribution in 6 months...* It wasn't easy; I postponed paying off my loans, lived frugally, worked a 2nd job. And I didn't tell anyone. 


That $16.5k I crammed in the latter part of 2009 is now worth what, $25k? $30k? Since then, through budgeting and frugality, I managed to pay off all debt and continue with the retirement contributions. I'm leaning toward 1/2 of my non-retirement money being cash.

I did an unscientific AAPL analysis. It’s based how the first quarter shapes the rest of the year, percentage wise, using the past 3 years. I feel the analysis falls towards the optimistic side of the spectrum, but I do not take Apple watch into account, so if that adds a few percent to the revenue, it might be realistic. I don’t think this is worth basing any decisions on, but I found it kind of interesting. Current analyst estimates are lower than these values.

The fund seems to have done pretty well since its creation but my hesitation is over the spike it's had since around Jan 20, 2015. I'm not sure if this is a good time to buy or if the price is going to drop some time in the near future. Also a big chunk of how well it's done is related to that spike and I'm not sure if that's more than a fluke or good management.

I'm not looking for short-term gains; this would be a longer-term investment.",2

15-02-07,2v3zb2,"Oil, black swan events and prediction markets. Yup, another thread on timing oil.","While I am not new to investing, I have mostly been a buy and hold investor. I have watched oil with some interest lately though because that kind of price change just looks like opportunity to me.

First, black swan events happen. We all know that and the whole point is that they are unpredictable. That being said, I do not see much chance of a black swan event that is going to drive the price of oil down drastically. But there are all kinds of unpredictable things that could happen that will drive the price of oil up. 

Also, it occurs to me that oil futures (link below) is a perfect (not perfectly accurate mind you) prediction market. Since oil futures increase the farther out you look, I think the market expects oil to go up. 

http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/crude-oil/light-sweet-crude.html

So, I am going to put a shit ton of money (20% of my portfolio) into oil now unless you care to convince me I am likely to lose 25% of it. 

**Are there any black swan events that could occur that will drive the price of oil down? 
**


I do not see that - no new huge oil supplies are coming on line and it is not like anyone could decide tomorrow to drastically increase production. And no new technological advances are going to be announced and immediately recognized as an oil killer. 

By their very nature black swan events are not predictable. I appreciate that, but that does not mean that we can not use our intelligence and imagination to consider possibilities. I do not see much or any possibility of a black swan event that will drastically reduce oil prices. ",0

15-02-08,2v5bbx,"Steve Easterbrook and McD's","I've been looking into McDonald's lately given their recent bad quarters and the stepping down of Don Thompson. 

I noticed the new CEO, Steve Easterbrook, left McD's in 2011 to become CEO of Pizza Express Ltd. While the company was bought for $900 million recently, it was a private company. On a quick google search of the company I noticed that on the company's Wiki page there was a section titled the ""2011 rebranding."" I can only assume that Easterbrook was the CEO of PizzaExpress when this took place and that this rebranding was part of the reasoning behind appointing Easterbrook as the new CEO. 

My question is this: for those of you familiar with PizzaExpress Ltd., how did the rebranding go? Was it successful in regaining market share, company following, etc. Any potential similarities between that rebranding and what he has to do with McD's? All I'm really looking for is any information surrounding PizzaExpress' 2011 rebranding. Any information is much appreciated!

I'm a 22 year old computer engineer who graduated college in 2014.  I'm just beginning to dip my toes into the world of finance and investing.  My tolerance for risk is high.  I've decided 30% of my portfolio is going to be dedicated to stock picking and playing the markets (aka FUN).  Please judge me on the following strategy:

**$4,000 to invest into oil / minerals spread across the following stocks (Looking to pull the trigger next week):**

* $1,500 TCK ... Risk: Medium
* $1,300 COP ... Risk: Medium
* $700 CVE ... Risk: Very High
* $500 FCX ... Risk: High

**My very conservative valuations of these companies return the following results:**

* TCK 2017 value = $38
* COP 2017 value = $80
* CVE 2017 value = $33
* FCX 2017 value = $24


So, thoughts?  Should I try to time the market better and bet that oil will hit a new bottom in the next month or just buy in now and ride?  Are any of these companies clear losers that I'm throwing my money away on?  Should I just stick to computer programming and never venture into individual stock picking again???


Edit 1: The valuations came from plugging in conservative numbers to a few of the relevant spreadsheets found here: http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/spreadsh.htm#ginzumodels and I also compared my valuations to the most popular expert valuations to make sure I didn't input a number incorrectly.",3

I started Day Trading in Feb 2014 off and on for the past year with good success and a huge blow: $50k profit in 3-months switched brokers made $250k in 3 1/2 weeks in September 2014... Then lost $270k in 3-days... Have been toying with small accounts ever since and blowing them up one after another. I just rejoined the prop group that I joined this time last year today (where I learned a lot and where I discovered my style). Fingers crossed this time is the right time (took two months off).

Dr. Brett Steenbarger (""The Daily Trading Coach"") told me that I'm not necessarily undisciplined but that I'm battling with the Bipolar and ADHD (impulsiveness/sticking to my plans and what not), but my main battle is with greed: taking damn profits (greed gets in the way) and cutting my damn losers faster (holding and praying)...

15-02-09,2v903j,How are the income cut-off limits to Roth contributions enforced?,"I have been contributing to my Roth account for a number of years. However, this year I will (fortunately) be over the MAGI income cut-off limit of $191K. While investigating alternative strategies (such as ""backdoor"" Roth contributions), I started thinking - ""How are the MAGI income limits enforced?"" 

Roth contributions are not reported on my tax return. Vanguard (by Roth provider) is not aware of my MAGI. How then, does the IRS ensure that people contribute in conformance with the regulations? 

Is it just everyone's responsibility to be aware of the cut-offs and invest accordingly? 

This issue came up when I was doing my taxes for 2014 with TurboTax and thought it would be very helpful if a box came up and said something along the lines ""Your MAGI is in excess of the allowable limits. You must re-characterize your Roth contributions."" But, TurboTax doesn't know about my Roth contributions because they are not reportable on my return...

15-02-09,2vcut5,Someone please burst my bubble...,"So I have been playing a stock simulator game on marketwatch.com for a highschool class and have been very successful so far(35% increase over 2 days of trading). Naturally, I am very skeptical, but I would like to share what I am doing to learn as to why it wouldn't work with real money. 

So my strategy is to basically find a very volatile stock the fluctuates a lot every few seconds, then try to find a relative floor and ceiling and buy and sell extremely quickly as it fluxuates. I found a stock called [UVXY](http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/UVXY) that was fluxuating about 1% every couple of seconds but didn't have a steep incline or decline. I also saw that this had somewhat bottomed out at it's floor at it's last year and had not taken a large drop recently which made me feel more comfortable about it not doing so. And if it did happen too, since I was buying and selling so quickly I would be able to cut my losses when I noticed the stock falling drastically. 

On the first day I did get lucky in a way because the stock did raise dramatically, today, however, the stock started and ended in a similar range and I still increased by about 13%(and I did most of this 30 minutes before close where the stock was decreasing drastically.

I'm sure I am missing something, but at the moment I feel as if this system minimizes the risks while maximizing the gains. Since I am buying and selling so fast I can only take a small loss when I see the stocks falling and I can keep riding a large increase. The only downside I see is the trading fee's which means I would need to be investing larger sums(which I don't have:( ) of money that wouldn't take a big hit from this.

Sorry if I did a poor job explaining this, I have very little knowledge on stocks so I did my best. Ask me any questions you need too.

So at the moment, I'm trying to calculate the annualised return in the S&amp;P 500 between 1/1/1960 and 1/1/2014.

I calculate this to be 6.55% using data from a couple of sources.

The calculator at [moneychimp.com](http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm) says the annual return is also 6.55%, but once you click 'adjust for inflation' and 'dividends' that goes down to 5.79%.

The problem is I can't see how they are getting that 5.79% number. I have tried using the data from Robert Shiller, as well as Yahoo and both sets of data give me a return of 6.55%. So anyone know how Moneychimp is working this out so that they get 5.79%?

Also, if I'm doing a project on this, which data set should I use? 6.55% set or the 5.79% (which I don't know how to calculate yet).

+ $340mn in LTM net revenue, up from $320 last year, so ~8% increase
+ 94 locations with plans to open 3 to 5 more stores in 2015 = $3.5mn in rev/store
+ $50mn in cash, no debt
+ Inventory turns at 2.8x versus 2.1x for ETH and 1.8x for RH (inventory has been building here)
+ recently agreed to purchase a remaining stake in a furniture mover/distributor for $20mn to be paid over 3 years.  The distributor generates roughly $60mn in revenue that will now be realized on the income statement, and had accounted for roughly $700,000 in net income.  Through the acquisition it is expected that it is acquiring a remaining 51% stake to consolidate the entity, giving them roughly $700,000 more in net income next year.

+ Net Income of $9mn, CFO of $30mn and CapEx of $18mn (built out 6 new stores and closed one)

+ foreign sourcing of 40% of COGS means that gross margins should be elevated this year due to stronger dollar

**Valuation**: Looking at $240mn market cap being made up of $50mn in cash, $25mn in real estate, and the remaining $165mn making up a business that just generated $30mn in CFO (or $25mn in my adjustments, you can do your own).

15-02-09,2vbdru,"[UCO,UWTI &amp; Mirroring trades] My dad: a true YOLO playa","for a little bit of background:

I started becoming interested in equities at around 2003-4. I would always do shitty, ""how i feel about these products"" research and tell my dad how I felt about a certain stock/IPO etc. I had no idea what fundamentals are, debt etc. At that time, we had nothing to play the markets with. But I had happened to make 3-4 calls which would have of course made my dad rich if we had the money to play markets with. You know the story.. etc. My first plays were buying AIG, Citigroup, and BAC shares for my father's RRSP after the crisis. After that I never played or traded until 2014. Coming from a biz background, I'm actually more into fundamentals and buying companies for the long term than anything else.

In september 2014 I made the ridiculous decision to buy, for my dad's RRSP, 1000 shares of DTO (leveraged bearish ETF on oil). But I also bought 10 shares of CP rail, 1000 shares of HBC, and 100 shares of both VEF (Vanguard FTSE 100 currrency hedged), and Claymore CUD (US Dividend Growers). Overjoyed by christmas, I liquidated DTO and left everything else be for VEF, HBC, CUD, and CP Rail. We went on vacation etc.. you know, the typical winning story. Thinking back, I probably would have never taken the risks I did. 

2 weeks ago I started thinking about making plays on a potential oil rebound. I'm playing with house money at this point so go figure I do more risky shit. Initially I wanted to make plays on options. I began day trading UWTI, UCO, etc. I made a good amount of money WSB; but I stopped completely after losing $300 in an hour on trading FXCM (sheer stupidity). All in all I made 1,8 grand on quick plays. Opening and closing positions in under 30 mins. 

Fast forward to this weekend when my father shows me his RRSP again. 

My heart sank. 

My father had mirrored ALL of my buys, but not sells, on UWTI and UCO from the period of January 28-30. He holds a position of 2000 UCO shares for an average cost of 7.76 and 6000 UWTI for an average cost of 2.54. He is up huge WSB. Huge. How can I convince him to sell both positions? I don't want him to feel like shit if oil takes another nosedive.

15-02-09,2vbgqf,Question: Hedge against inflation for investing in land in Brazil,"A couple of days ago I had a meeting with a very large agricultural company in Brazil.

I don't know a lot about investments, but the operating director explained me how they make money for their investors (I added his numbers for return on investment).

1) Increase in land value. They convert land into agriculture. (Value increased 4 times in 6 years)

2) Returns on the farm from growing crops and selling these. (About 2-3 % p.a.)

3) Hedge against inflation (4-8 % p.a.)

15-02-10,2vf5n7,NVGS: Navigator Gas Analysis,"I posted this at a bad time last time and was told to revise and repost at a more appropriate time so I hope this works.

I was taking a brief look at NVGS and wanted to write down some thoughts and see what you all thought and could contribute as well.
NVGS or Navigator Holdings is a Natural Gas tanker company that owns and operates the world’s largest fleet of handysize liquefied gas carriers. Their market share is upwards of 50% of the market they operate in. They have increased their fleet from 5 in 2000, to 23 now and have almost doubled fleet size since 2012.
As natural gas production increases due to fracking and horizontal drilling U.S. production is approaching a need for export. LNG exports are currently legislated very tightly but reform is expected soon to open exports more broadly. This would be beneficial for U.S. natural gas companies and transport companies as natural gas in other countries can be more than twice the price of U.S. natural gas due to supply issues. As exports become more common we should expect global prices to reach an equilibrium probably lower than they are.
NVGS has on paper performed excellently. They are profitable with very strong margins and are trading at what seems to be a reasonable value given the decrease in oil prices is not as big of an impact on their business as the market estimates. Currently they have a market cap of $950M, Revenue of $297.8M (TTM), and Income of $71.1M. This has given them a TTM P/E of 10.5 as the market contraction has affected them (but so far not their profitability or sales increases), and a forward P/E of 8.27. NVGS' PEG ratio is 1.17 and it's P/S ratio is 3.19. NVGS is also not trading at a significant premium to tangible book value at 1.22x however as we know these assets become significantly discounted in a commodity crash environment and in a crisis we should not expect a 1:1 conversion into cash. Assuming a 40% depreciation for a fire sale situation it is trading at a still reasonable 1.7x salvageable book value. This gives a relative valuation cushion. NVGS does have significant debt with $440M of long term debt or 6.1x net income, however even at current depressed prices it's debt to equity is only 0.56. Liquidity concerns are valid with a quick and current ratio of only 1.0 but margins remain strong dousing concerns somewhat.
In terms of revenue and income growth EPS this year has grown 58.9% YoY and is expected to grow at a 31% pace next year and 9% over the next 5 years. Sales for the quarter YoY were up 25% at a brisk pace. Margins as stated are currently quite healthy with 53.3% gross, 34.5% operating, and 23.9% profit. NVGS does not currently pay a dividend and hopefully will shore up it's balance sheet before deciding to do so but eventually should have the potential for a solid yield as it's earnings yield (the amount per share that is net income and can be paid out as dividend assuming an unreasonable 100% payout ratio) is 7.63%. If NVGS shores up it's balance sheet and earnings grow as expected next year that would be an 8.25% earnings yield, at a 50% payout ratio that would garner a yield of 4.17%, at a more conservative payout ratio of 35% that would still yield 2.88% off of the current price.
The current state of the company seems very healthy but yet the price is depressed. When I see this usually I feel cautious, the market sees something I don't (potentially). There are risks to the business that aren't reflected in the past that may come up in the future. The current ones I see that are most worrying to me are as follows.
Natural Gas price is very volatile, especially of late, and is currently depressed. Not as badly as Oil but still there is a significant decline. The largest immediate impact to the business will be natural gas prices. It is a complex issue, as if they remain high globally tankers will have an incentive to export from an area of cheap prices (the U.S.) to other locations, but in the long run this should bring all gas prices to an equilibrium weighted based off of natural gas usage and cost of transit. So while lower natural gas prices in the U.S. would seem negative for this stock I'm not quite certain that's true. It seems the ideal situation for productivity is low U.S. natural gas, legislative easing of regulation, and high global prices.
Oil tanker situation - A potential similar situation happened with oil tanker companies. There was a very large and growing market for oil tankers so many companies put in large orders for more tankers, this created a massive oversupply and many companies had to lower rates, sell off parts, or go bankrupt. Most have not recovered. If NVGS is caught up in a production war competing for market share it may end up reducing competitive advantage and pricing power.
Finally a minor issue but at a glance this just appears worrying. The company has very few employees with only 22 listed employees. Why is this? This is a shockingly little amount of employees for a $950M company and reflects income of $3.2M per employee which is very high and if legitimate is very healthy.
What do you all think? I have only taken a brief look but it seemed worth diving deeper and I wanted to share because I would love if this subreddit became people doing analysis on stocks instead of pitching vanguard index funds for the passive investing crowd only. I welcome any criticism or comments!

A couple notes in addition to last time. Some questions from /u/hedgefundaspirations

&gt;What would it cost to convert another type of tanker to an LNG tanker? Is there something special about LNG tankers that requires them to be purpose-built? If not, then I would expect that as the market grows (especially if legislation passes), then other tanker companies will convert at prices much lower than buying a whole new ship. This would be similar to the oversupply-from-ship-orders concern that you have, but much faster and potentially much more severe.

I'm not sure the exact costs but using a proxy from an oil tanker turned floating LNG deposit it looks to be expensive. One estimate would peg it in the ballpark of $5B. This isn't an accurate proxy but it should be in the relative ballpark. It seems like it would be quite expensive because LNG tankers require expensive refrigeration and incredible pressurization which reduce volume of the gas up to 900 times which oil tankers do not.

&gt; Re: 22 employees - Are they merely leasing these ships? If so then the number of employees isn't worrying, but you'd sure as hell better get some insight into what those contracts are like (e.g. pricing terms, length of leases, etc.)

On LinkedIn they list 38 employees, there appear to be estimates of 50-200 actual employees. Their 10K has this to say.

&gt;We had 22 employees as of December 31, 2013. We consider our employee relations to be good. Our crewing and technical managers provide crews for our vessels under separate crew management agreements.
 
This seems to indicate 22 is the number for the holding company managing staffing of ships that are not counted.",2

First off, I understand I should have read up far more or paper traded before diving into my first options trade, but I decided to learn through sink or swim.  

I'm typically a buy-and-hold investor and recently my GPRO holdings have tanked 16-17% post earnings. I got rid of my shares and decided to buy some puts to hopefully make myself even or better (I forsee the stock going even further down for the lock up).  

I purchased 10 put options for $2.09 ($2,090) with a strike price of 43.50. [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/PkkbvVP.png). Can you please break this down for me to a t? My understanding is that I have the option of buying 1000 shares of GPRO on Feb the 20th for $43.50 and then immediately selling it at market price, which is hopefully less than that amount; the difference being profit. If the share price goes above $43.50 on Feb the 20th, I lose my initial investment $2090, correct?  

Can I trade my 10 contracts at all before Feb the 20th? Do people typically ""exercise"" their contracts or are they selling contracts back and forth?  

In the future, how does one pick the optimal strike price / date? In the future, I'll also make sure to read more before really diving into options; it's definitely a world I don't quite understand yet.

15-02-09,2vc2to,Is there a way for an American to directly invest in Chinese stocks?,"I've read that recently the Chinese stock market has been opened up to American investors.

http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20150111/REG/301119998/china-and-the-worlds-hottest-stock-exchange-beckons-for-american

However, from what I can tell, the extent of this openness is that Americans can purchase ETFs which focus on the Chinese stock market.  I am more interested in purchasing individual Chinese stocks, specifically in their defense industry.

Is there any way for an American to do this?  I use TD Ameritrade for what it's worth.",1

15-02-10,2vft8f,ELI5: Why are bond *funds* considered such safe investments?,"I understand why owning bonds themselves is relatively safe. If you own US treasury bonds, and the US treasury defaults on them, then the whole world is probably completely fucked and your investments are the least of your worries. In other words, if you own good bonds from reputable issuers, you'll get your money as long as you can wait for them to mature, even if the bond market goes to shit. 

Okay, but say I'm an average retail investor who owns bonds through a fund like a target date fund. Stocks completely tank, all value is gone. Luckily, since I'm, say, 80, I've long since changed my allocation to be heavily in favor in bonds. But now that the stocks have lost all value, my only option to be able to live and pay for food and housing is to sell off some of my bonds. But everyone else in the same situation. The bond market is flooded with people trying to sell bonds so they can live, since that's all they have left to sell since the stock market tanked. So prices of bonds drop through the floor, and now there's no value in either stocks *or* bonds. 

This is what I don't get. I understand why stocks and bonds have the sort of inverse relationship that they do, and why it's good to diversify. But I guess I just don't understand how bonds hold any sort of value, how they could act as a safety net *unless* you actually own bonds themselves and you can afford/survive long enough to actually let them reach maturity. 

In other words, if stocks tumble and retirees have to start selling bonds at market value to survive, doesn't that cause the bond market to collapse, too? Basically, the conventional wisdom would say that if my portfolio is half bonds and half stocks, I should be okay even if the stock market collapses. But as far as I can tell, the value of my bonds would collapse too. Why doesn't this happen? Is there a risk of this happening in the future? ",8

15-02-10,2ve8kj,"Stops, Limits and Stop Limits","I've read up on the differences, but would like to hear some of the situations in which you guys use each.

For example, they say that stops are generally used to cut losses, while limits are to lock in profits. Is this generally the case?

Let's say I own a position and see it climbing gradually from its current value at $25. I see the chart and expect resistance at the $30 and decide that I want to sell once the stock reaches $29. In this case would I put a stop at $29 or limit at $29.

Conversely, if I hold a position which is currently at $25 and I am going on holiday, I decide that I want it to sell if it drops below $20 in order to cut my losses. Would a stop or limit be used?

From what I understand, you would put a limit for the first and stop for the second. I just don't see how one would use a stop limit, or which situation it would be useful for. ",2

15-02-10,2vfx21,Question on the concept of holding stocks,"Disclaimer: I am not extremely experienced with personal investment and I won't claim otherwise, I have someone investing almost all of my capital for me. 


I don't understand the concept of holding stocks. It is my understanding through common sense that if you predict a stock to be profitable you should buy, so why do analysts often say a stock is a hold? I understand that it may be mentally easier to hold because of potential future losses if you have already made money on the stock, but objectively speaking it seems as though losses are losses. I play a lot of poker and this kind of mentality is used to be a strong long term player with earnings in mind. Regardless of win or lose, if you stick to the formula you will eventually win long term and it's important to not let emotions effect your decisions. 

So basically I feel like holding a stock can never be the correct decision but rather an emotional decision and instead you should either buy more if you decide to ""hold"" or just sell it otherwise. I must be wrong though. Anyone care to enlighten? ",3

I bought into BBEP, LINE, MEMP and VNR in December, and sold during the bump last week for a nice gain. My initial plan was to buy into them at their all time lows and just set it and forget it. After seeing how volatile oil will be in the near term, I'm now considering make a significant play in the best of the bunch. I'm describing best as the one with the best chance of the highest return. I watched BBEP go from $4.50 a share to $9.00 in about three weeks. There should be at least one more major dip before oil can pick back up in Q2. Even with oil at $60 I believe BBEP is a $9.00 stock at the least.

In short I'm considering dumping 20k on BBEP if/once it comes back down to around $5 a share. I have done extensive research on all 4 companies and the overall industry the last few months. I am curious to see if there is anything out there I overlooked. I figured what better way to talk myself out of a potentially asinine decision then to engage in a healthy forum convo. I know about the upcoming debt covenant deadline, and the highly leveraged position of BBEP.

The money is what I saved working last year, and I also have a one year emergency fund. So if needed it could sit in BBEP earning dividends if there was a prolonged oil price drought.

15-02-10,2vgcty,Alternative investment - directly purchasing inventory for small businesses,"I discovered this company Kickfurther, which lets you invest in small companies by purchasing inventory for them. These companies have sold products before (e.g. from Kickstarter funding) but don't have enough capital to purchase more inventory to sell. (Typically they get really onerous loans from manufacturers, but Kickfurther has better rates) In return for contributing, investors get a cut of the sales. [How it works](https://kickfurther.com/learn)

**Why I like it:**

* The offers have like 20-30% APR
* Get to support growing businesses that make cool products
* Very responsive company (I've emailed Kickfurther with questions and the CEO responded)

**Main Risk**: What if they don't sell the inventory? Possible mitigation is that you actually *own* the inventory so Kickfurther can help you liquidate it and at least recover some of the capital.

If you like it you could use [my referral link](http://kickfurther.com/s/k57rqys84w) which gives you $5 (and I'll get $5 if you end up investing anything). I don't work for them.

15-02-11,2vk8cf,Charles Schwab - complaints valid?,"Hi /r/investing,

I read some unsettling info on the website below:
http://www.consumeraffairs.com/finance/schwab.html

&gt; The key thing is during the settlement it seems the broker ""rents"" at interest stock to a short seller. So say they rent your 100 shares of stock that you just sold for $10 a share xyz stock. The short seller returns to you 100 shares of xyz stock except they are now worth $8 a share. The broker pays you $8/share but reports to the IRS on your 1099 that you received $10/ Share. The thing is when you breakout the shares, the quantity and price differ from what is on you transaction page.

My question is: is this even possible? How can they possibly do this, legally? If I sell 10 shares for $10 dollars, how on earth could they justify paying me anything but $100?

Background: As an impressionable college freshman, I decided to follow the advice of my peers and academic counsellors to pursue a career in a field of interest without factoring in the financial outlook of my degree (Bachelors in biology and chemistry). I am now two years out of school, living at home, and working a part-time internship that shows no sign of turning into a full-time job in the near future. I'm currently making less than 20K/year, and the best going rate for the jobs I am qualified to do are somewhere in the neighborhood of 30-35K/year. The national average for bachelor's degree holders in the US was 46.9K in 2012†. I've decided that I want to cut my losses and start working toward a higher degree that will qualify me for an occupation with a better job outlook and a salary that meets (or at least comes close to) national averages within its category. All of that being said, what areas I should be looking into?? Any advice would be immensely appreciated!

†http://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cba.asp

TL;DR: Two years out of school w/a bachelor's degree. I'm poor and working virtually for free. Want to pursue a higher degree in hopes of a better salary &amp; better job prospects.

Let’s say your goal is to compound capital at 15% annually.  The GARP model seems to work.  But finding businesses that can grow at that rate can be a difficult thing to forecast.  Another method is rotating in and out of stocks trading below intrinsic value.  But that process comes with higher fees and taxes.

Let’s say the second method generates 30% annual returns before taxes and fees.  After your expenses, the returns would be 15%.  Would you still go down this route or stick with the long-term approach?  

Are there any research papers showing how taxes and fees effect returns and by how much?  In some countries, there aren't any capital gains taxes.  Does anyone know the returns of investors in those countries?

I forgot the password to my Vanguard online account, which disables your password after 3 incorrect attempts. In order to reset your password, their system asks for some basic information (Name, SSN, DOB, Zip code, etc) then emails a reset link to you.

When I tried to do that, I received an error message and was told to contact their customer services. After contacting them, I was told that they cannot reset my password because they are unable to verify my identity. I am able to provide them with all the correct information and answers to security questions, but for some reason there are 2 zip codes listed in my username. One zip code for a Roth IRA, which is the only fund I opened and for which I was able to verify my zip code. But there is apparently a second employer-linked retirement fund that has a different zip code. Problem is, I never opened an employer-linked retirement fund, so I have no idea what they're talking about. My company's 401k is not handled by Vanguard. I went through every zip code I've ever lived in and my employer's zip code as well. No luck. I have no idea where this account came from or what zip code is associated with it. But I am told that until I can provide them with that zip code for verification purposes, I cannot have my password reset. The mysterious retirement fund has a balance of $0.

What can I do now? They have acknowledged that I have provided every piece of information needed and correctly answered every security question. I even have bank statements showing monthly auto-deposits to my Vanguard account. But until I can provide that unknown zip code, there is nothing they can do.

TL;DR - a new retirement fund has somehow been opened under my name, and listed with an address that I do not know of. Vanguard refuses to reset my account password until I can verify that address, but I have no idea where that account came from or what the address is.",1

&gt;It also allows for odds 1.25, if it succeeds in maintaining fixed exchange rate policy.

The negatives that I see are occasionally forgoing some appreciation and increasing my capital gains tax liability.

15-02-11,2vksa0,"Why is my ""risk tolerance"" considered higher when I'm younger?","This is probably a ""Moron Monday"" question but I couldn't find it answered in this sub. People say I will have lower tolerance for risk as I get closer to retirement but that doesn't really make sense to me. They say as a young person I should take more risk, and the ""you have longer to recover from a loss"" argument just doesn't hold water for me. My thought is this: a loss from risky investment at a young age is very unfortunate and it is not made up for by all that ""time you have to recover"". Because such a loss is multiplied as an investment opportunity loss over my life. Say I lost 50k because I picked the ""wrong"" stocks early in life. Not only have I lost 50k, but I COULD have put that money in an index fund, and after 30 years it would be worth a LOT more. So there is a huge opportunity cost, right? 

I'm just trying to wrap my head around why an investors age has anything to do with their strategy. Seems like risk tolerance is more to do with your personality. I mean, as long as you've put aside enough money for necessities like food, shelter, and medicine for your golden years, I don't see why your investing strategy (risky vs. conservative) would ever change except for personality reasons.",0

I just finished looking through her account for her and it is nothing short of insane.... he has 55% of her entire portfolio in ONE STOCK. ONE. And it is an oil pipeline company to boot (it has done well over the 5 years she has owned it, up 132% in those 5 years as of yesterdays close, and pays out a dividend of 4.5%). He then has another 30% in a high interest saving account earning 1.1% per year - the final 15% is sitting in cash, doing nothing. 

Is this normal? I mean I know it is not but maybe this kind of investing is more common then I think? We are both in our mid 20's so I know that puts us in the higher risk appetite category which is fine, but come on, one stock? What do you think about it? We are meeting him in 1.5 hoursish so please reply!

*edit*
I should clarify, the account is NOT up 132%, it is much less than that (its just that one stock, the only stock she has now, that is up that much in 5 years). Flipping through statements over here, looks like the account on a whole is up in the 70% ish range. He does not give her yearly statements with a clear % gained breakdown, just a giant list of trades / dividend payments etc so its not super easy to pull final numbers from it. 

*edit*
Thanks for the replies! We are heading out to meet him. From what I can see after looking at the papers etc she would have been better off just investing in the SPY like DayTradingGod suggested. Just the fact that he does not offer us yearly % gained / loss info on her account is enough to make me consider switching to another advisor (why wouldn't you be upfront about how the account is doing?).

3) Average annual EPS growth since 2012 is 31.93%
4) Average annual revenue growth since 2012 is 27.8%
5) They have an EXTREMELY large amount of Free Cash Flows.
6) Their revenues and net income have grown YOY since 2009 at extremely attractive rates.
7) NPM is a whopping 48.03%
8) ROA, ROI &amp; ROE are 13.41%, 26.74%, and 24.95% respectively.
9) They've maintained a wide economic moat over their competitiors for a VARIETY of reasons (which I'll let you read about since I don't want to write a novel).

15-02-12,2vlrbr,Canadian Banks,"Hello all,

I've been investing for a little while now and I've heard some hype about Canadian Banks that has peaked my interest.  There are a bunch of points that I feel I need to understand a little better in order to really appreciate why they're a good deal right now instead of just falling in line...

1.) Canadian banks are a safer investment than American banks.

2.) How the currently low Canadian dollar affects the banks (Drops the inflation rate causing less profit?)

Current stocks I'm looking at: RY (Royal Bank of Canada), BMO (Bank of Montreal), CM (Canadian Imperial Bank) which all seem cheap after recent downfalls and have a sweet dividend to ride out the low times... But it still seems like they're trending down...

Any thoughts or recommended readings on the finance sector? 

Thanks!

As of now I've considered taking the safest route of index funds but the problem is that here in India they aren't cheap -- usually the expense ratios floats over and around 1%. Investing in that doesn't seem a very good option so I've started reading about investing in my spare time.

I was reading ""The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing"" and the following passage caught my attention: 
&gt; Managing an index fund is very cheap and easy. Nobody has to decide which funds to buy or sell or when to buy or sell them. The manager simply replicates the index. It's easily managed with the help of a computer.

While I've read in here about people using computers to actively track their investments, can a person who has limited knowledge of stocks use computer to manage their investments passively? Any books and/or pointers will be appreciated.

I can code so ""using the computer"" part isn't a problem for me.

15-02-12,2vnojy,Get Like Buffett - Rules For Investing,"
I’m not a big fan of “invest like Buffett” or “rules for investing like a billionaire.” But here’s six simple rules that are pretty darn good. Again, simple, but hopefully something for everyone. If nothing else, to remind us that investing isn’t all that hard if you have a strategy that works for you and you stick to it. 

**1. Think simple** If it’s an everyday need and embedded in the economy of daily life, chances are it is represented in the portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway, which is big on insurance, utilities, energy, railroads, retail, finance and manufacturing. Familiar “grocery cart” brands reflect timeless consumer needs, and that translates to the steady, long-term growth Buffett values. Berkshire Hathaway’s holdings include insurer GEICO, battery maker Duracell and financial services firm Wells Fargo. If you use it all the time, you may want to own a slice of it.

**2. Find the core value** Companies constantly complicate their financial reports with one-time ""extraordinary expenses."" You may not have an army of number crunchers at your disposal like Buffett, but you can learn basic indicators of core value. So what’s a ""core asset?"" It’s what you’d buy if you purchased the company, such as real estate, inventory and intellectual property. Track the ""book value per share,"" which typically reflects the firm's core value compared with its current stock price.

**3. Turn off the news** Buffett knows that no long-term good can come of reacting to today’s economic news. Instead, follow Buffett’s lead and think a few steps ahead of today’s headlines. You can’t guess exactly what the government, the Federal Reserve and the market will do, but you know in general that, say, the government will act to stabilize the economy. That's where the opportunities are.

**4. Know the basics** Once you get a grip on the book value, find out how much money the company makes with its assets. Buffett looks for a consistent 20 percent return on assets. That cuts out a lot of companies. Also examine trend lines. A company that used to return 10 percent on assets and now returns 20 percent is headed in the right direction. Warren is interested in why.

**5. Be patient** Do you have your eye on a few companies that seem to fit the Buffett mold? Monitor them, to see how well they make money and how their stock price is valued. If the company consistently makes money but its stock price is out of whack with its book value, you may have detected a good candidate to buy and hold. 

**6. Don’t be afraid to pull the trigger, but stay the courser** Buying and holding builds long-term wealth, even though many investors try to score on immediate market opportunities. Buffett buys to hold forever. He has described his investment style as 'lethargy bordering on sloth,'. If your horizon isn’t quite as eternal, plan to stay in your investments for at least five years. The market has proven that it takes at least that long to ride out a cycle. It needs time to grow.",124

The event brings together some very well respected money managers to share trade ideas (ie. talk their books). Each PM normally presents a top pick, meaning we'll get a focus list of about 9 stocks that could be worth investigating. Obviously take their picks with a grain of salt, who knows what their entry price was, but it's always nice to see what smart money is doing.

Last year, their 9 picks generated an average return of ~25%, ahead of the S&amp;P of ~15%. 2 picks generated negative returns, and only those 2 picks underperformed the S&amp;P.

* There is Rite-Aid's recent EnvisionRX purchase that recently sent it spiking.  
* It was already under $8 for a while until that buy, which quickly got the backing of Jim Cramer of Mad Money and www.TheStreet.com (for what that's worth, anyway); he now deems it a serious growth stock.

My first thought was it would be tax evasion, but let me know what you guys think. Keep in mind that this is not an actual situation, but a hypothetical which is intended to provoke some discussion. 


So you are presented with an opportunity to receive payment in the form of stock from a privately held company. The stock would be valued at $10, but for your payment the company is willing to give it to you at $0.10 a share. So instead of $65,000 cash you receive 650 shares worth $6500. 
You then proceed to put this stock into your RothIRA, which has a $6500 cap per year. You pay your taxes on this amount. The company then goes public and the market stabilizes at $10 a share. Haven't you essentially put $65000 in your retirement account without going over the cap?

In the new base adjusted series, besides changes in the weight of items and groups, CSO now uses geometric mean for computing inflation from the arithmetic mean used in the previous series. The Reserve Bank of India has set a target of restricting inflation to eight per cent by January 2015 and six per cent in January 2016.

Service tax collections in January registered an year-on-year (y-o-y) growth of 8.3 per cent, compared to 5.2 per cent y-o-y growth in the previous month. Services is the biggest sector of Indian economy and service tax constitutes a major part of indirect tax collections. Excise duty collections, another large contributor to indirect tax, showed a y-o-y growth of 8.7 per cent for the month of January, but it was lower than 17.2 per cent in the previous month. The two components helped the overall indirect tax collection show a growth of 7.4 per cent, giving the government a relief on the fiscal deficit front. Recently, the finance ministry and the revenue department had given out a mandate to tax officials to boost revenue collections, which were muted in the first three quarters.

15-02-12,2vmh66,How to Identify the Short Term Market Peak,"For short term investors and traders, it’s crucial to recognize the short term market peak when it happens.  I’ve already discussed the characteristics of long term, multi-year bull market peaks. This time we’re looking at short term peaks (that are not new all time highs) and their characteristics to help you maximize returns on your private investments.

 

Define a Short Term Market Peak

Before we identify the common characteristics of a short term market peak, we must first define this term. Here’s an example – GDX, the gold miner’s ETF:

 Multiple Resistance
Multiple Resistance
No New All Time High

As you can see from the chart above, this type of short term market peak is not near an all-time high. Rather, the market has fallen for a while, and this is the short term market peak during one of the waves in a subsequent uptrend.

Time Frame

The “wave” lasts just a few months – anything longer than 4 months, and this is not considered to be a “short term” market peak.

The Above Example

As you can see the chart for GDX (gold miners ETF) above, GDX has fallen for almost a year now (which coincides with the decline in gold and silver). Only recently has GDX moved off of its lows. This fits in perfectly with the “short term” market peak concept. GDX is nowhere near an all time high (in fact, it GDX just hit bottom), and this recent wave has only lasted over a month.

Identify the Peak

When you make short term investment decisions, you absolutely have to use technical analysis. However, the problem is that there are many technical indicators. In the event that these indicators are sending mixed signals, which one should you use? Which one is more important and can override the others? I honestly don’t know.

HOWEVER, I do know that when all the technical indicators align and point towards one direction, the probably of that happening greatly increases. If all my technical indicators send out a clear SELL signal, then the odds of the market falling is very likely.

Regarding short term market peaks, 4 things will send a clear SELL signal when they all happen at the same time:

Major resistance.
Heavy volume.
Intraday bloodbath.
Connections between markets.
Major Resistance

Markets will often peak at a price that was a massive historical resistance point. If you look at the GDX chart below, you’d notice that GDX failed to break through this resistance barrier multiple times in the past 6 months. Thus, the fact that GDX is right below this resistance level today means that it will likely fail to break this resistance (again). This sends a major warning sign that the short term peak is in.

 Multiple resistances, + the recent massive red bar
Multiple resistances, + the recent massive red bar
Heavy Volume

A lot of traders like to look at volume – I don’t really know why. They believe that volume sends a lot of clear signs – personally, I can’t seem to make volume work to my advantage.

However, volume is really useful when the market faces a major resistance and promptly falls. Such a decline in market price combined with heavy selling means that the market is very weak. Thus, a clear warning sign that the market might peak is sent.

Massive Red Intraday Bar

If the market falls really hard one day without any meaningful support, it will create a massive red intraday bar. This means that the market is really, really weak because there is virtually no support. Coupled with heavy volume, this sends a clear sign that the bears vastly overpower the bulls.

Connections Between Markets

I don’t just look at one market – I look at 8 markets. I look at multiple U.S. stock indexes (Russell, S&amp;P500, NASDAQ), multiple commodity markets (gold, silver, copper, oil), and currencies (primarily the EURO/USD pair). Why?

Because markets are highly correlated nowadays, what happens in one market will affect other markets. For example, I recently believe that the short term peak for stocks is in. Thus, stock prices will fall. When stock prices will fall, it will likely drag down gold and GDX (gold miners) prices with them.

Summary

When the following three things happen at the same time, it is very, very likely that the short term market peak is in:

A massive red intraday bar.
Heavy volume – this is the only time when volume is useful.
A massive resistance line that has stopped the market on multiple occasions.
Other markets are falling, dragging down this market with it.",1

#[GURE](https://secure.sigfig.com/l/stock-quote/US:GURE?from=cp)

---

###Some backstory first:

I've been invested in GURE since 2011, back when it was GFRE and [TMFBabo](http://my.fool.com/profile/TMFBabo/activity.aspx?source=iersitlnk0000002) mentioned it on the Motley Fool CAPS. As an aside, I know how some of you feel about TMF and I agree that much of the day to day activities there are just blogspam, but I do think that their overall goal of investing awareness and even some of their newsletters/recommendations and stock screener are valuable.

I initially bought GURE sometime when it was around $12.00. I would have sold out but I was traveling abroad when it collapsed and my stop-loss unfortunately expired. Regardless, I've continued to track it and eventually felt good enough about it to purchase more shares at the $2.00 level and recently another 500 at the $1.20 level. As of right now, My current break-even point is $3.51. I'm not affiliated with the company other than owning 606 shares and am obviously motivated in the stock going up. 

I'm mainly a Fidelity Commission free ETF's investor, but every once in a while I'll invest in an individual stock. I've beaten the S&amp;P for the past 3 years, but have not beaten the S&amp;P since I started investing in 2007 (that ""tuition"").

Hopefully that's enough disclosure, but if you want to know anymore, feel free to ask.

###About GURE

Gulf Resources is primarily a Bromine supplier in China, though they've been expanding into other markets as of late. Bromine is used in flame retardants and oil and gas exploration. They extract this from their wells in Shandong Province, China. Bromine's spot price is expected to remain [stable](http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/bromine/mcs-2015-bromi.pdf). According to Gulf Resources, [they supply 20% of all the Bromine in China](http://www.gulfresourcesinc.com/resource-reserves.html) and are the [top producer of Bromine in China](http://www.gulfresourcesinc.com/about.html).

###Why I think it's undervalued

 1. Market Cap of $66M vs Cash on hand of $132M
 2. Book value of 7.93 per share.
 3. Low P/E of 3.29
 4. The company is profitable and is expected to continue
 5. No long term debt (usually a good thing).
 6. [They just announced oil reserves under their well in Sichuan](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/gulf-resources-announced-finding-natural-130000877.html)

###Concerns

 1. They are a Chinese ADR - These are considered more risky (see BABA) because they are not necessarily accountable to their international shareholders. The Chinese government could potentially acquire them if they choose.
 2. Likewise, Chinese companies are notorious for falsifying their balance sheets. [Glaucus Research ran a nasty report on GFRE back in 2011.](http://www.streetinsider.com/Trader+Talk/Glaucus+Research+Gives+Gulf+Resources+%28GFRE%29+a+Strong+Sell/6448276.html)
 3. Management has been viewed as squandering their opportunity, especially with unused cash on hand. Though it seems with recent purchases and [share repurchases](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/gulf-resources-announces-2-million-133000589.html) that maybe they are starting to get on the ball.
 4. They had to [settle a lawsuit](http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2014/02/10/608860/10067677/en/Gulf-Resources-Announces-Final-Approval-of-Settlement-of-Class-Action-Lawsuit.html) in regards to their sudden drop in stock price.
 5. Their new-found gas reserves may not be suitable for extraction.
 6. They recently [issued more stock for an acquisition](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/gulf-resources-accelerates-transformation-enters-133000252.html).
 7. Low stock price and dismal performance since 2011.


---

###Conclusion

This relatively unknown company has been seeing a lot volume lately. This is a value play - with the absurdly low P/E and the amount of cash on hand, I think it's at least worth a look if you're looking for a new high risk investment. I think this company is at least worth it's cash value, so long as the earnings are positive. 

I personally won't be buying any more shares at this level, but would consider it if the price dropped back down to $1.20. Further, I  anticipate I would start selling some of my shares at or around $3.40, but would hold a portion up to $6.35 (80% of book value). 

As always, I encourage you to please take this as a *start* for your own investing research. I am **not** an investing professional. If you haven't already learned not to take other Internet people's stock picks with a grain of salt then you're going to have a bad time.

Nevertheless, this community is a great place to learn about investing and share ideas. I hope this post contributes to that. Good luck out there! ",12

15-02-13,2vqxb0,Starting A Publicly Traded Company,"I am a consultant with 6 years of oil/gas experience related to designing and implementing program managment and cost tracking programs at several major Canadian E&amp;P companies.  I am currently completing my MBA in the evenings through the U of C and I have a good understanding, from both work and school, of NPV, TVM, capital budgeting, operational efficiency, business processes, etc.

My cousin has 5 years of experience in the geology field, specifically gold and coal (but with oil/gas knowledge as well).  He is, like I am, extremely passionate about his work and he finds a lot joy in what he does.  

We both make over $120,000/year (before bonuses), but we want something of our own.  After speaking together in detail, we would like to either 1) start a mining company in northern Canada, or possibly in South America (but dealing with foreign governments, corruption, etc. may be more difficult than a Canadian EIA) or 2) aquire existing companies that are in trouble due to poor management/operational inefficiency (with a strong asset base and limited debt) and make them profitable.  We both acitvely trade stocks as retail investors, but our startup knowledge is limited.

I am unsure of where to start - there is the CSNX, which I suppose is the Canadian version of pink sheets, but ideally we would begin on the Venture Exchange.

Can anyone with relevant experience guide me with respect to where I start?  It may sound ridiculous, but if you look at some of the crap on the exchanges I mentioned, my goal seems very reachable.  There are many, many operators that only a fool would invest in and they're staying afloat.  Our goal isn't to pocket millions and get out - we want to pay ourselves fair wages (not giant stock options that screw our investors), have something of our own, and create exponetional growth (at some point) for our shareholders.

Sincerly,

A Small Town Raised, Honest Guy

If a company raises money sometime before a catalyst and the combined holdings of insiders + institutions + funds is so large that a single day's volume is comparable to the number of remaining shares...

Then all you need is some fundamental upside and it runs, a lot, every single time. It doesn't even matter if good news is extremely likely and so why would it run so much? Well, it can, with dumb retail and smart money gouging company financings, it is common.

Obviously bail before the catalyst, then work the mess afterwards with me, gl.

I recently moved to the US on a work visa (valid until 2019) with every intention of obtaining permanent residency. According to my immigration advisor, it will likely be 18-24 months until my green card process is completed. As it stands, I am sitting on $20k (and growing) in a Bank of America account making a rate of 0.03%. Obviously I would like to use this cash more efficiently.

The two brokerage account providers I have spoken to today (Merrill Edge and Vanguard) require permanent US residency to open a brokerage account. I would like to get some advice on options for either opening a brokerage account with a provider who will not require my green card to be issued, or alternative options for investing this cash (I've been looking at LendingClub, any opinions?)

My question plain and simple is this. Why exactly are people so bullish about Apple? I personally do not feel as though a company is a good investment when over 50% of its revenue relies on a single product (the iPhone) and when their primary economic moat is their brand.

I definitely understand the financial strength of this company and how important and significant their brand is in today's tech driven world. However, what happens when consumer preference changes and people don't want an iPhone anymore? What happens when they finally hit that innovation roadblock? Will ApplePay save them? Steve Jobs (their primary innovator and visionary) is gone. Will they lag now like they did when he was ousted?

All insight on this is welcome.

-Relative reward to its previous 52w h
-Risk analisys to where the stock was sitting before the collapse
-dividends
-profits
-some news

I think my biggest statistic is the OVERALL market went down and not these individual stocks. So yes the news isn't on their side but my local gas station is up 20 cents. Oil will go up another 30-40% and if I am wrong the economy has bigger problems now. 

I originally put in 30k, it went up to 34.5k. and when I re-invested a few days ago I put in another 5k. 

I went back in a few days ago and it tanked 7-8% and its roughly back to where it should be today.

15-02-12,2vp4rq,Thinking of making calculated risk investment in National Bank of Greece (NBG),"OK so before you guys &amp; gals take out your pitchforks/torches and stone me to death in public square, just hear me out.

I currently have $30K sitting in my Self directed IRA account and I'm thinking about investing the entire amount in NBG stock. 

My Reason:

* Greece is country so they will have to sort out their debt obligations if they want to get future loans

* NBG has been through the downturn before in 2003 and 2009 and has came roaring back 

* NBG has gained about 15% over the last week since it's initial drop

* I'm in my early 30's so if I loose this money it will only put be back by 1-2 year in retirement which is 30 years away but if it works out then I can put me many years ahead

* I will go in with a 50% Stop loss, so I don't end up loosing more than 50% of the 30K in case things turn for the worst

Now tell me your thoughts or start the stoning process. I'm ready!

**Update 2/13** : NBG has gone up 30% over the last two days since I posted this post. It would have been a good investment to make 30% in two days. I guess I'll wait and watch how things turn up on Monday. ",3

15-02-14,2vtum8,Crowdsourced reddit portfolio update - mid Feb.,"It's that time again. Earlier in the year we started aggregating stock picks for 2015 from redditors. Here's the latest.

reddit portfolio performance: **3.85% gain**

S&amp;amp;P 500 YTD performance: **1.85% gain**

Leading the charge is a long $NFLX call by /u/akkatracker, up 41%. 

/u/miketeeeveee and $AXDX is up 24%. The $EXXI call has gone from big loser to big winner thanks to the oil rally of late - thanks /u/plmattice. The $AMD call by /u/killerhurdz was questioned a lot, but it's up 19%. Recent adds include $VRSN, $AKAM and $FCAU (personal fave), which are all up nicely. The losers...well don't worry about those - still a lot of year left. 

As we refine the process: We’re looking for long/short equity ideas only. 

Keep it reasonable on the market cap -- i.e. nothing below $100mm. Also, give the catalyst/thesis in the comments - doesn’t have to be long, but simply “STLD, it’ll win ya big” won’t cut it. 

Let’s keep it to just one idea. If there’s a strong case to sell a strong, post the thesis for that too.

Link to the link to the portfolio is below -- as always, feedback and suggestions welcomed:

Hopefully, you can use this to generate ideas or learn valuable lessons.

15-02-13,2vs2te,Need advice on starting an investing club with a group of childhood friends,"Perhaps this is the wrong sub but I've received great advice from here before so figured I would give it a shot.

So a group of my childhood friends and I would like to start a sort of investment group to eventually buy a vacation house for all of us. There will probably be about 15 of us and I want to figure out the proper way to get this all started. Before anyone says this is a terrible idea, that's not what I'm asking.

What I would like to do is start a fund that in the meantime we can put towards a conservative mutual fund or something. I use Wisebanyan for my personal accounts and wonder if there is something like that I can do with a group. I don't want to put it all on one persons name and end up having some tax issue for just that person.

Is there a free online bank account I can set up that allows multiple people to view the balance but not withdraw? How do I set up an account that requires multiple people to make a withdraw or transfer.

Do I need to create an LLC or what other legal stuff should I do? I know I need to write a contract and determine how we will make investment decisions and such.

And whats the best place to invest in a mutual fund or the like with minimal fee's (think Wisebanyan).

Thanks for any and all help!",1

Gilead and Abbvie both came to market around the same time with HCV drugs that effectively cure the patients; the drugs cost about 90,000 USD per regimen. Lots of money is at stake.

Drugs selling for lots of money is rather par for the course in biotech/pharma. What is unique about the case of Gilead and Abbvie is that they have made the unprecedented move of making exclusivity deals with payers (insurance companies). For instance, CVS will now sell Gilead's HCV drug, but not Abbvie's.

The question I am struggling with is will this become the de jour practice in biotech/pharma, and if so who are the winners and who are the losers. Any insight is appreciated.",8

What level of disclosure is required on the small business side of things? I can imagine a situation where I have to take on a very wide variety of duties on an ad-hoc basis.

I am single and would obviously prefer to disclose a minimal amount of information. Do you know if I have to disclose exact addresses of the rental properties? Do I have to disclose the address of the small business?

Is there some way that I can completely avoid the rental disclosures by holding the property in a trust vehicle? Can I make all of my investments through a single vehicle?

I'm curious if anyone has had good experiences with either Tradestops.com or the paid ios ""Stock Tracker"" app.  I want to implement trailing stop loss notifications for my portfolio and my eye has been caught by these two solutions.

Tradestops.com is $150 annually vs the $16 one-time Stock Tracker app purchase.  If they both do what I'm looking for (email or other notification when a trailing stop-loss limit has been detected), I'd lean towards the app since its cheaper and I can check it more frequently.

Any thoughts?

My broker also allows online trailing stop-loss orders good for 60-days but I've heard that having an open order like that can enable subtle market manipulations by bigger players so that they could easily get those shares if they wanted them.

15-02-13,2vpxve,Been playing in spreadsheets a lot lately and confusing myself a bit. Looking for some return math help.,"I've been breaking down my returns to the month.

However, I've noticed a discrepancy which I believe stems from contributions as the markets fluctuate through the month but I can't quite wrap my head around it.

Here's a simple example of what I've found:

January Fund X Performance = 0.42%
February Fund X Perforfmance (to date) = 3.20 %

Sum these and you get 3.62%

HOWEVER, the confusion for me is if I simply check my yearly performance to date of Fund X: [NPV/(Jan. 1 Value - contributions)] = 4.77%

The confusion for me is 3.62% =\= 4.77%. 

Should my return for the year not equal the sum of the months so far? It seems there is a more complex calculation going on here and as mentioned I do believe this has to do with contributions at different market values of the fund, but can someone explain this to me? And confirm that both values are valid.

Anyone have any opinions on the company?  It seems like their brand name would still mean something...there are rumors of Chinese companies wishing to take over AMD, but at present it looks uncertain.",3

15-02-13,2vt2py,Feb 2015 Week 2 Results,"Alright folks, this is just a recap of my plays ending 2/13:

TSLA MAR27 Calls @ 215 
	Got lucky with this one. Once I read the article that Musk was threatening to fire senior management in China for not making sales goals, I excited my positions. Managed to come out on the plus side before everything went down on after earnings

BABA MAR27 Calls @ 88
	Noob move on this one.  I got scared with the losses and managed to get out with a small loss. Should've held longer though. Lesson learned

GPRO MAR27 Puts @43.50
	Positioning for next week's lock up expiration. Someone here made an argument that during last lock up stock went up but I think that was due to the holiday season. Pure bet on this one on my part though.

AAPL MAR27 Calls @128
	Again positioning for next week. I think it has some more room to move up but I'll be watching broad market movements Monday from Greece talks. Will be ready on at the open on Tuesday to dump or just hold out.


Missed the boat on the NVDA earnings options wise but got some shares that did appreciate so I'm not too bummed about it.

15-02-14,2vx6oz,"The reality of the trading education industry, including the penny stocks market.","Nearly everyone online that offers a so called trading system is doing so because they can't actually make money themselves in the market. The few people that do offer a legitimate system don't disclose their entire system because then they can't sell their useless alert services to their clueless subscribers. I only know of one person that does in fact offer there entire system and it's actually profitable.

There's a lot of fools online that hate their miserable jobs and are looking for a get rich quick scheme and therefore will buy these stock guru's bs.  It's pretty sad actually. I've been a full time trader since 2002. The reality is trading is not easy to learn unless you have a real trader to guide you and that's very hard to find. It took me 2 years and thousands of hours of studying to do it on my own. I bought hundreds of programs and I've read over 500 books on trading. I tried to follow other people but learned the hard way that this is not possible (despite what people think). 

The only way to be successful is to learn to be 100% self sufficient. There's no such thing as earning as you learn either. Most people aren't willing to put in the time, don't have enough risk capital (they mistakenly think they can start with $300 and turn it into millions), are just plain lazy, or straight up gamblers. This is why the majority of people fail and think the stock market is a scam because it is rigged for the great majority of the general public.

Profitable trading not only requires a technical trading system, but it also requires strict money management, and most importantly learning to control ones emotions. Most people will never be able to learn the skills needed to succeed in the market because it requires extreme discipline and dedication which few people truly have. 

Binary options are basically a scam. They are a lot like playing a casino like roulette game with terrible odds. Options in general are much more complex then individual stocks (because you aren't just picking a direction, but also how far and how fast a stock will move) and if you can't make money in a regular stocks you certainly aren't going to learn to trade a derivative like an option. All of these automated day trading robots for trading forex or futures (index and commodities) are also straight up scams. They were backtested with historical data but are curve fitted which means they won't perform in forward testing. ",4

2)  It seems like, based on the tax rates, if my taxable income were low enough, I would pay 0% on my capital gains.  So, would it be smarter to file separately and try and get my taxable income down below that threshold?

3)  When filing separately, can mortgage deduction be put entirely into one persons filing or does it need to be split?

15-02-14,2vvmy5,"Anyone looked at ICD? Found it yesterday, became infatuated with it over the next hour, and bought 500 shares...","Hey everyone,

So basically my boss sent me a report on the drillers from Morgan Stanley and I was looking through and came across the piece of shit micro cap ICD.  They contract drilling services in the Permian Basin and own rigs.  Even claim to have something proprietary.  The stock is off 50% since IPO'ing in August close to the energy market and has one of those cliche names that makes you feel like the stock is sketchy as fuck.  

I start to look through the numbers and I'm pretty flabbergasted that they came public and used part of the proceeds to fully pay down their debt. I'm thinking that you don't see many energy companies do this during a mania.  

I look at the balance sheet and I see that they've got 200 mil plus in PPE and that the stock is trading close to 60% of tangible book value.  ""So you mean to tell me if they get credit for just 80 of book value, the stock has 30% upside?"" I said out loud to my boss.  Meanwhile, they're forecast to actually make money next year (whether or not that'll happen who knows).  Point being, the cash burn should be modest and the stock is pricing in a much larger problem.  

So lastly, I take a look at the holders list.  Sprott is an insider, a good shop out of Canada who I know more for their fascination with precious metals but can see how that would translate into all commodities.  They own a quarter of the company.  Then I see Fidelity shows up as a 13% holder.  Could they have sold it in the last quarter? Maybe, we'll know next week when the filings come out. Still a little peculiar for Fido to get involved in an $150 million company.  Then I see Jennison shows up as a new buyer and owns 10% of the company... these guys are a well respected shop.  So the point of all this being, for a micro-cap stock, these guys have a good following.

So I end up within the next two hours, after a discussion with my Dad who tells me he just bought a driller trading at tangible book and thinks its cheap, buying 500 shares in my PA to add some juice to my energy portfolio.  I now own WPT, VNOM, EMES, HCLP, and ICD.  So long story short, this is interesting and everyone should take a look.  If anyone knows these guys, would love for them to weigh in.


TL;DR: Found cheap energy stock trading at 60% of liquidation value and a clean balance sheet, bought shares immediately


EDIT: /u/vycid has brought up some very good points about book value not being book value at this point and that the assets are not worth what they say on the balance sheet. I want to acknowledge the validity to what he's saying but state that I'm making a call on future oil prices which is not explicit in my post.",23

15-02-15,2vxwcl,"Beginning Guide To Daytrading From A ""Bragging Trader""","I was bored and i gave a random poster the complete rundown on how i started daytrading. **Take what information you want, but please, this kind of trading doesn't work for everyone (also it is only recommendations, not forcing you to do anything)**. So don't blame me if you get into it and suck. I also mainly short, almost every trade. Here it is:

**It is (in my opinion) the most fun form of trading.** If i were you i would stay away from pennystocks until you have a good understanding of stockpromotion and short squeezes. If you want to succeed in daytrading you should record each trade and write down where you want to get out of a stock (pretty much a mental stoploss).

**Shorting intraday is not easy,** you have to adapt and be ready to understand when to get into and out of a stock. Here is trade I made recently: http://i.imgur.com/aMU43pI.png?1 As you can see, I had gotten in with a set idea when I wanted to get out. I shorted because I felt the momentum has shifted and I looked for a opportunity to get in. This is in my opinion the most important aspect in a daytrader. (*Note: people think this is bragging, i am using this trade as an example since it is easiest to explain why i got in and out*)

**Also i use suretrader which bypasses the pattern daytrade rule. I think they have a good short list too** (except for gene, rip)
And the scan i use (the basic version): http://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=211&amp;f=ta_perf_d5o,ta_volatility_wo5&amp;ft=3&amp;o=change, your choice to use it or not. Lots of traders would say ""ew those stocks suck"", **i get the ones with the best setup to short**. One day consider coming back to this scan once your are more experienced

**When you start out, do not go in and immediatly trade.** Paper trade first and record your trades, (don't lie about ur trades either, record the truth). Obvious learn all you can by reading books. Once you feel like you have a good understanding of daytrading then go ahead and try it with real money. Each trade you should get in with an idea where to cut losses and collect gains


Useful video: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VjqAO8vo440 , i traded gluu almost identically when it spiked recently, i just waited for the first bounce and shorted.

[Update #1 here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/2sn2pj/update_1_college_student_betting_everything_1500/)

Hey everyone, it's been a little over a month since I made all of my initial purchases. I've now sold all of my holdings but one, and it has been a success. I turned $1,552 into approximately $2,159 (40% increase). Here are the specifics.

AGEN - 100 shares

* Bought at $4.03
* Sold at $4.99
* This was actually my second biggest failure. I watched it get up to over $6, but got greedy and wanted to see it up to $7 or $8. As it started to dip back down to where I had bought it at, I just decided to sell and keep my gains.

ARRY - 120 shares

* Bought at $4.85
* Sold at $6.903

DDD - 10 shares

* Bought at $31.37
* Sold at $30.06
* My one true failure. Somebody mocked me in my last update post for holding DDD, and they were totally right.

GASE - 9,000 shares

* Bought at $.0226
* STILL HOLDING. Currently at $.059
* This is my stock pick of the year. A Ukrainian energy company whose stock price fell from $.7 to $.02 last Spring. With the new cease fire deal, I am still progress with this company.


That's all for this round of risky picks. If you have questions about why I chose the companies I did, check the original post. Much luck was involved.

15-02-15,2w0i23,Trading strategy,"The new strategy I'm thinking of applying is something a little more calculated and simple.

So let's say Monday morning, I would buy a blue chip stock like Apple or VISA or something and it rises 3-5% in a day or two, that's not too uncommon with those stocks. A 5% return on a $3k investment is about $150. That's not too bad for a day or two's work. So multiply that by three or so and I'm averaging a few hundred dollars a week. Obviously this is very idealistic and I will most certainly have losses, I'm not silly, but the one most important rule I've learned from my experience is to cut my losses quickly. So I will set a bottom that I will always sell from, maybe 1-2%. This way I will minimize my losses and try to have good small gains. So instead of looking for those silly amateur 50% jumps on penny stocks, I will look for small 3-5% gains on blue chip stocks over the duration of a few days. What do you think? I would love your feedback. I'm an amateur so I understand I am very ignorant of all this. I'm not looking for insane gains. Just small gains that add up. ",0

Right now, Apple has assets totaling $232 billion (I know they have liabilities as well, but bear with me for a moment). The number of outstanding Apple shares is 5.82 billion.

Thus, doesn't that mean that a share of Apple is really just a claim of ownership on a piece of Apple worth ($232 billion / 5.82 billion) around $40? And if you factor in the total liabilities ($120 billion) that number drops to below $20 per share.

I know I'm probably wrong and I'm missing something obvious, but to me it seems right now everyone buying a share of Apple is essentially buying a stock worth $20 for a price of $127, with the hope that it'll be ""worth"" even more.",15

15-02-16,2w39op,"What's management's mindset when they speak to the public during a earnings conference call?","In my opinion, generally speaking, they don't want their company's shares to go down since: 1. The management holds substantial amount of their company's shares. Their wealth shrinks if the stock price goes down. 2. The share holders will put pressure on them since they have the responsibility to maximize share holders interest. 3. They have the obligation to disclose any negative or positive news by the laws of SEC.
But the management's tone still has a lot of wiggling room during a earnings call. Eg. During MU (Micron Technology) last quarter's call, the management sounds very negative about the demand. Eg. John Chambers was extremely positive during CSCO's (Cisco System) call. He said numerous times ""We have never so well positioned"". His tone is absolutely more bullish than the numbers. 
My question is, I can understand all managements want to  have a positive tone so the stock price can go up, but I don't understand why MU's management sounds so negative. They could simply just mention the slowing demand and not emphasize on that too much, if they want to just dodge the SEC regulation without triggering the stock price plunge.

15-02-16,2w3ofm,Mannkind (MNKD) has started sales of Afrezza (Inhaled Insulin),"Huge potential diabetes market for this drug...  Just wanting to know what people think?  Basically it's insulin that is taken when you eat a meal.  Afrezza was approved by the FDA last summer and they just announced it was available in pharmacies about 2 weeks ago.

Type 1 diabetics still need to take a long lasting insulin injection in addition to using Afrezza.  This drug only replaces the meal time insulin injections.  It's approved for Type 2 diabetics as well.

Personally, I think MNKD is worth closer to $50B instead of it's current $2.7B market cap because Afrezza will have sales numbers in the $billions plus additional revenue when other drugs get combined with their Technosphere delivery technology.

Good stuff:

* Ultra-rapid fast acting insulin... No other insulin on the market like it.  Afrezza works in the body most closely to natural insulin from the pancreas compared to the competition. 

* Milestone payments from Sanofi should start be recorded as revenue

* Very few hypoglycemic events (sugar lows) because Afrezza goes into/out of your body so quickly

* So simple to use, multiple diabetics demonstrating use on twitter/youtube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHUZImm7-2I  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afmq-GX76bU

* Institutional ownership has gone from 18-25% over the last quarter with Blackrock recently taking a 5% position.  40% of the float is owned by the founder of the company, Al Mann.

Bad stuff

* Diabetics are afraid that the dosing (4u or 8u) is too limiting and they need more precise dosing

* Limited supply, only 1 production line in place producing Afrezza

* Huge, huge short interest

* MNKD gets 35% of profit in the partnership deal with Sanofi.

Near term:

* Board of directors are supposed to make a decision (February) on what other drugs/partnerships will best use the Technosphere particle to restart their company's drug pipeline.  It's either going to be (inhaled) pain meds, vaccines, or other diabetes drugs.

* Prescription numbers are starting to come out weekly

* No marketing has begun because they want the Sanofi sales/drug reps to visit/educate doctors before patients flood them with questions

* Marketing may kick off in March or later

* MNKD just built 2 additional production lines for Afrezza that should be coming online very soon

15-02-16,2w0y07,"Interlisted Canadian &amp; NYSE Companies","General question here: why are Canadian stocks doing exceedingly well while the Canadian dollar weakens?

Basic logic tells me that correlation is, in fact, causation: that Canadian companies on the Canadian exchange are going up in price because the Canadian dollar is weaker, necessitating that surge for interlisted stocks. 

Take BCE for example. Over the last 6 months, BCE on the TSX (Canadian exchange) is up 15.55%, whereas on the NYSE it's flat. That 15.55% is roughly the equivalent of the descent of the Canadian dollar relative to USD. 

And this example holds true for various interlisted Canadian companies in a variety of industries.

So, my questions:

1. Is this correlation precisely what I think it is, as outlined above?

2. If so, then why is the larger Canadian exchange (TSX) only up 8.5% over the last 52 weeks? I'd imagine interlisted Canadian companies (essentially, every 'megacap' Canadian company) make up a large portion of the TSX. So if the CAD has plunged, and all of these Canadian companies' TSX share prices are soaring to represent that plunge, then the TSX ought to have outperformed the S&amp;P 500, no?

... on the other hand, to point #2, perhaps the general commodity decline (which precipitated the CAD plunge) in oil, precious metals, base metals, et al., has hit the TSX harder than the interlisted stocks' gains.

Edit: Yahoo! owned a 40% stake of a variable interest entity that held some of Alibaba's most valuable assets, but not the actual company. In 2011, the Chinese government forced Alibaba to remove a valuable asset, Alibaba Pay, from the VIE, and Yahoo! was powerless to do anything.

~~Now, there's a loop hole that they use to get around this of course, but it's still there.  If Yahoo!, a $40 billion US corporation, can be forced to divest their 40% interest in Alibaba, then what rights do you think you have?~~

Plus, I'm suspicious of any financial reports that come out of China.  They're a dictatorship and I'd rather invest my money else where.

Here's a great link to what's actually happening when you invest in BABA:  http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/05/06/alibaba-and-vies-a-primer/

AAPL - The Apple Watch will be interesting because it will be the first post-Jobs product that Apple will produce.  I won't know until I try it myself, but I do have some doubts.  Watching the demo, the demoers had to touch the screen a couple times for it to wake up and show the time.  So it's already the world's worst watch.  But the screen can't always be awake because of battery life issues.  Which makes me wonder, will consumers really want to be recharging their watch through out the day?

Which leads to the next issue: Siri.  Siri is more a novelty than an practical interface.  So we're still left using a touch screen as our primary interface.  Except the screen is tiny and is littered with tiny icons.   Making it the world's smallest iPad.

Finally, there's durability issues.  A $300 watch better damn be water resistant.  People can't be taking it on and off to wash their hands.  And the watch itself needs to be insanely durable.  More durable than any smart phone.  Remember, this won't be in your pocket all day.  It'll be on your wrist.  It will get banged around.  The screen can't get scratched every time it bangs into a corner.  Most people don't realize this, but watch glass is actually very strong.  Even the glass on a cheap children's watch takes an enormous amount of force to crack. 

Course, I can always be wrong.  When the iPhone first came out, it only had 6 pre made Apps and no Appstore.  And look how that turned out.

GOOG - A wonderful advertising company that's never seen a side project they didn't like.  I'm big on corporate synergy.  The wonderful thing about Disney or Apple is that every major new product adds to their universe.  In contrast, Google's CEO is like the dog from UP.  ""Squirrel!""

Self-driving cars, and prosthetic skin, and asteroid mining are really cool concepts.  But they have nothing to do with their core business of selling people's information to advertisers.  They spend a comparable amount of money on R&amp;D as Apple does, but Google makes 1/6th the profits.  These high-profile side projects may be sexy as hell and attract investors in the short-term, but in the long-term if profits aren't growing, then all the blue sky in the world won't save the stock.

And I think we've already begun to see that over the last year.

FB - Facebook's network effect is drastically over-stated.  Before Facebook there was MySpace, and before MySpace there was AIM.  Now a days, the kids prefer Instagram (which Facebook owns) and Snapchat (which Facebook doesn't) and any number of other sites that we've never heard of.

A social media network is like a bar.  Why do people go there?  Because it's popular.  Why is it popular?  Because people go there.  It's a completely circular argument, and eventually it falls in on itself.  Remember your college days for a second.  Think of the strip of bars downtown.  It was like a revolving door wasn't it?  Every semester, a bar would close and a new one would open up.  They're terrible, terrible businesses.  Even bars that have seemingly been there forever, often go through changes in ownership.  With new ownership dumping their lifesavings into the terrible business, like the owners before them. 

Facebook will share the same fate as MySpace.  Will it be in 5 years?  I doubt it.  Will it be in 10?  Maybe.  A risky proposition for a company's who's priced in for massive future profits that may very likely never materialize.

Not to mention, there's always the fool's hope that the government enacts new consumer privacy protections.  jk

TSLA - They're a car company.  That should really be all I have to say.

Final Note:  I realize there's a rumor about Aapl is making an Apple Car.  I think this is a terrible, terrible idea.  Making an Apple interface to sell to car manufacturers is wonderful.  Expanding into the entirely unrelated, unprofitable car business is absolutely terrible. 

I think there's a natural propensity to believe what we want to believe.  And that affects people's judgment when it comes to businesses.  If a product or service seems cool to the consumer, then they won't stop and think ""is this product or service viable from a business perspective?""  

And cars are simply not viable from a business perspective.  They're capital intensive.  Labor intensive.  And at the end of the day, there's little in the way of brand loyalty.  So there's little pricing power between peers.  And if you don't have pricing power, then you're not in a wonderful business.

15-02-16,2w43ae,The Extraordinary Story of America’s Most Successful Industry,"I'm going to have to spoil the surprise to discuss this.  So go ahead and take your guess first.  This industry outperformed all others in the US stock market over 1900-2010, and one of its companies outperformed all others from 1968 to the present.  The answers are, [industry (mouse over)] (/s ""tobacco"")  and [company.]  (/s ""Altria"")

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/02/13/the-extraordinary-story-of-americas-most-successfu.aspx

It's the analysis that the author gives that is completely misguided (in my opinion) and is refuted with any belief at all in efficient markets.

The first reason he gives for tobacco's outperformance is ""A lot of investors (understandably) want nothing to do with tobacco companies.""  But that would only work, in the sense that one could buy tobacco companies at a discount, if *everyone* in the market were disinclined to invest in tobacco.  It only takes a small segment of investors indifferent to the moral implications (and who are competent analysts) to bring the prices of tobacco companies into line so that their expected future returns are the same (on a risk-adjusted basis) as the rest of the market.  Think of it this way:  these amoral investors analyze the stock market as a whole (ex-tobacco) and conclude that expected future returns are 5% annually.  They analyze tobacco and expect future returns of 10% annually.  So, of course they buy tobacco stocks, raising the price, and they're not going to stop buying until the price has increased to the point that they have expected returns of 5%.  It does not matter that some investors conscientiously object to buying tobacco stocks, as long as the amoral investors collectively have enough money to buy the tobacco stocks to bring them to fair value, which they certainly do.

The second reason he gives is that tobacco companies don't have to innovate, as compared to tech companies or pharmaceuticals or similar.  Say tech companies spend 10% of revenues on R&amp;D, whereas tobacco spends barely any.  That's an extra expense for the tech companies.  But so what?  Investors know that, of course, so it's baked into the stock prices and expected future (risk-adjusted) returns.

Seems like total baloney to me.  If his analysis were true, you could just assemble a nice ""sin"" portfolio of stocks/industries that some people won't invest in (tobacco, alcohol, fossil fuels, etc.) and handily outperform the market.

So why has tobacco outperformed?  I don't know.  It had to have some advantage over other industries *that wasn't properly accounted for by investors*.  Who knows what that is?",5

Over the past year i've been slowly building up a decent array of knowledge about investing and have got a pretty good grip on the basics and some more advanced investing strategy. I could tell you about tax offsetting strategies and some fancy stuff about inverse leveraged ETPs but a trader I most certainly am not and I need you guys to evaluate some noob logic for me.

I've been looking at 'shorting' in a general sense (I am using this term in a loose way without properly defining it) and am looking most specifically at CFDs. Looking at IG it appears that I can trade with only a 5% margin giving some pretty fearsome leverage. There is also the ability to set a 'guaranteed' stop loss that guarantees no slippage in the case of a market gap.

-------

Now imagine purely hypothetically that I am waiting on the results of a popular stock/trading update etc. Imagine now that there is market uncertainty in the results and as such I can assume that a set of target beating results are not already priced in.

Now say that I believe the results will be positive. My noob logic tells me:

Go long on CFD at max leverage making sure to set a guaranteed stop just below the initial purchase point (there will be spread concerns associated with this)

I see 2 possible outcomes:

1.  The market reacts positively to the results, stock price increases, I profit at maximum leverage, feel like a boss and eventually sell out at a later point locking in gains.
2. The results are catastrophic, stock price drops like a stone. But my guaranteed stop saves the day and locks in a small loss.  

(conceptually I have not factored in fees, commissions, spread price etc)

Now to me the basic idea of this appears a little too good to be true. So as in the title: what am I missing here? Also, how guaranteed is a guaranteed stop?

15-02-16,2w1yl4,Hypothetical about insider trading and internal versus public predictions.,"Hypothetically, if someone knew what a company's internal performance predictions were, versus their public predictions, how could one use that to their advantage?

I am looking to keep it simple and choose a broad ""macro"" investment strategy where I avoid picking sectors in general, focusing instead on choosing stocks versus bond and picking regions(US/EU/Emerging markets etc.). Should I make an exception for REITs? The case could be made to do so if it gives access to the real-estate market which a slightly separate part of the economy, but I am unsure whether REITs in practice give any meaningful diversification?

REITs appear quite correlated with stocks for the last few years, but I have read that they have been negatively correlated in the past, so I guess it could change in the future. Of course real-estate is a separate asset class from stocks and bonds, but to me REITs are somehow some hybrid of a real-estate holding and a holding on the general economy.

15-02-16,2w4s56,Exciting times ahead for Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX),"**What is VRTX?**: Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated is engaged in discovering, developing, manufacturing, and commercializing small molecule drugs for patients with serious diseases in specialty markets. The company focuses on developing and commercializing therapies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF); and advancing other research and early-stage development programs. It markets KALYDECO to treat patients of six years of age and older with CF who have specific genetic mutations in their cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance (CFTR) regulator gene in the United States, European Union, and Canada. The company also provides INCIVEK in the United States and Canada for the treatment of adults with genotype 1 hepatitis C virus infection, as well as markets telaprevir in other international markets. In addition, it is developing Ivacaftor in combination with CFTR corrector compounds, which has completed Phase III development program; and evaluating VX-661, a second investigational CFTR corrector, in combination with ivacaftor in Phase II clinical development. The company identifies and develops next-generation CFTR corrector compounds that evaluate in regimens combining ivacaftor with two CFTR corrector compounds. Further, it is involved in various other research and early-stage development programs, including programs in the areas of oncology, multiple sclerosis, and other serious and rare diseases. The company sells its products principally to major and selected regional wholesalers and specialty pharmacy providers in North America, as well as government-owned and supported customers in Europe. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated was founded in 1989 and is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts.

**What is exciting?**:  a couple of FDA decisions coming up, with radically different potentials to increase the biotech's revenue.

First, the agency is expected to rule by March 17 on expanding the use of Vertex's cystic fibrosis drug, Kalydeco, to treat children ages 2 to 5 who have the G551D or one of the eight additional gating mutations.

Kalydeco is already on the market for patients 6 and older with those same mutations. In all of North America, Europe, and Australia, Vertex estimates there are only 2,600 cystic fibrosis patients with the mutations, so this particular expansion isn't going to move the revenue needle much.

Vertex's lumacaftor combined with Kalydeco, on the other hand, will have a major effect on revenue. The company estimates there are 8,500 people in the U.S. alone age 12 and up with the F508del mutation that responds to the combination treatment. With the FDA approval, Vertex will quadruple the number of cystic fibrosis patients it can treat even before adding in an EU approval that should come toward the end of the year.

The FDA has a goal of making a decision on the combination treatment by July 5, but if you're looking to buy ahead of the decision, I wouldn't wait too long. When Kalydeco was first approved in 2012, the FDA made its decision two and half months before its PDUFA goal date.

15-02-16,2w4ty7,"what are your guys' opinions/ favorites for some under the radar potential 2015 IPO'S.","Everybody is really excited about Uber, Airbnb, Spacex and Dropbox. But are u guys excited about some under the radar IPO's. What are they? 

I am personally looking forward to Redfin's IPO. They were expected to go public in 2014, but they were able to raise 70 million, and did not submit an IPO. 2015 is the year many believe they will go public. 

Many of you guys wouldn't have even heard about Redfin, they are still a start up, founded in 2004. Redfin is a real estate brokerage, but the twist is that like Uber/Airbnb/and Tesla, they are a ""rule bender"", and do things an unconventional way. They have had battles over regulations and legislation just like Uber/Airbnb and Tesla. Investors in Uber and Airbnb and have also invested in Redfin, they have raised a total of 166 million. 

A little bit about their business model- Just like a traditional brokerage, they make money when they consumers use their agents to buy or sell homes. But the comparison stops here. What makes them unique, is that their agents are full time employees (99.99 percent of tradional brokerages' agents are independent contractors) and are a payed a salary as opposed to being payed on just commission. So, Redfin has solved what is  an age old problem in the real estate industry which is real estate agents are often not putting their client's interests first. When an agent is payed on just commission, the agent would often encourage the buyer to bid a higher offer, just because they can get more commission. By paying their agents salaries, Redfin has attempted to solve this problem, because there is not really an incentive for the agent to encourage the client to pay more money and submit an higher offer as the agents' pay is not dependent on the commission at all. They are payed salaries, bonuses, etc. So, they dont really care if their client chooses a 100,000 home over a 500,000 home. What matters is that client is happy as on top of the salary, their bonuses depend on the customer reviews sent after every transaction. So, this is what makes their model unique. 

other notes- They were founded in Seattle in 2004, and are in 51 major markets right now. A year ago, they were 23 markets. So, they have gone through a massive expansion. Also, worth nothing that redfin.com is in the top 300 websites visited in the US, and attracts approx 5 million visitors a month. When they raised 50 million in 2013, their valuation was rumored to be at 500 million. At the end of 2014, when they raised 70 million, their valuation was not disclosed. Conservative estimates would be 700 million, and an aggressive valuation would be 1 billion. Any other under the radars IPO'S that's worth noting. I was looking at Zoosk, but I have a bad feeling about them right now.

&gt; As if the above wasn’t enough, a final look confirms the oddity of market valuations. Riding the unabated trust of its investors, BuzzFeed brings three times less money per employee  than The New York Times does.

15-02-16,2w2tet,"Let's take a look at Yara International (my second analysis)","**Introduction**

Yara International (from hereon referred to as ""Yara"" or ""the company"") is a Norwegian company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange under the ticker YAR. Yara's main business area is the production of fertilizers used in the agricultural industry. The main focus is on nitrogen-based fertilizers, however, Yara also produces phosphate-based fertilizers and potassium-based fertilizers. Yara's other business areas includes the production of dry ice, nitrates, ammonia, urea and other nitrogen-based chemicals. Yara is the world's largest supplier of plant nutrients. 

The biggest shareholder is the Norwegian government which owns 36,2% of the shares.

[One year price development](http://i.imgur.com/6goVMAc.png)

*Before I continue with the analysis I have a word for the readers. This is my second published analysis (you can read the first one [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2jvq8v/lets_take_a_look_at_prosafe_my_first_analysis/)) and English is not my first language. Therefore you have to expect some grammatical mistakes. Please bear with me. Since I'm a novice security analyst, I hope that you will provide some constructive feedback or advices to my ongoing journey of becoming an expert security analyst. Everything from suggesting books that I should read to raising question about the analysis is very welcome. With that said. Let's begin.*

**Yara in a macroeconomic setting**

Yara's earnings are highly dependent on the state of the agricultural industry which is a cyclical industry. This makes Yara a cyclical company. Looking at the numbers through a cycle (see ""The numbers"" section) shows that Yara is dependent on the cycle, as you would expect of a cyclical company, but can handle being in the bottom of a cycle without experiencing financial distress.

 At the present moment Yara is thriving due to high USD/NOK exchange rate and low gas prices. The exchange rate benefits Yara because of the increased competitivenes a weakened currency brings. 

 The lower natural gas price is essential to Yara because the production of (nitrogen) fertilizers requires massive amounts of natural gas. A further reduction (or just a non-increase) in the price of natural gas is a major potential catalyst for increased earnings in 2015. 

 In the long term, Yara has a positive exposure to several megatrends. The megatrends that are going to benefit Yara are:

* Higher population and higher food demand - This is obvious since Yara is producing fertilizers used to increase crop yield.
* Higher urbanization - Fewer farmers are going to supply food to a growing urban population. Effective fertilizers are essential if you want to have enough food in the future urbanized world. 
* Focus on climate changes - Yara is highly focused on sustainability and is commited to creating a sustainable agriculturial industry and provide green solutions for farmers.
* Resource scarcity - The fertilizers increases crop yield and less water (and other scarce resources) are needed for food production. 

**Moat**

As the world's largest producer of plant nutrients, Yara has a clear production cost advantage through economics of scale.

 Being the world's largest producer of plant nutrients, Yara has developed a strong brand worldwide. Yara is especially known for producing high quality products and for being focused on sustainability.

**The numbers**

I want to start this section with a review of the 10 year financial results. 

[Ten year summary](http://i.imgur.com/gKnCxq4.png)

 As can be seen in the picture above, Yara has had strong growth in revenue and earnings over the last ten years. The balance sheet has also strengthened significantly over this period of time. The increase in NIBD from 2013-2014 is a result of two recent acquisitions. Even after this new debt, Yara remains solid with a debt/equity of 64,26% and high solvency (see solvency number under the ""Competition"" section). 

 Looking at the fertilizer sales per region shows that Yara is diversified across most of the globe. This prevents adverse economic developments in one part of the world (droughts, floods, war etc.) from bankrupting Yara. Europe and Latin America are the biggest markets. 

[Fertilizer sales by region](http://i.imgur.com/ujVLDKn.png)

 As stated in the introduction, Yara is diversified across different products. The picture belows shows the production volumes of Yara's products. Nitrogen products make up a big part of the production volume which makes Yara highly dependent on natural gas prices. 

[Production volumes](http://i.imgur.com/lWa7tD3.png)

 Cash flow is strong with no need for raising additional equity or debt for daily operations. Debt is only being raised for making acquisitions and large investments.

**Management in short**

The CEO of Yara International, Torgeir Kvidal, has a long history in Yara International. He started as trainee in 1991 (back then Yara was a part of Norsk Hydro) and has advanced internally reaching CFO in 2012. He held this position until October 2014 where he was appointed CEO. One of Torgeir Kvidal's predecessors in the CEO role (Thorleif Enger who left in 2008) was involved in a corruption scandal involving Yara's foreign activities. Torgeir Kvidal does not strike me as a kind who will follow in the shoes of Thorleif Enger and engage in these kinds of activities. He answers question straight up and he seems like a person of integrity who is not going to sweep scandals and illegalities under the rug. 

 Reading through transcripts from earning calls and public statements, all members of the management seem to abide by Yara's ""Ambition, Trust, Accountability and Teamwork""-culture.

**Dividend and share buyback**

Yara's dividend policy is to pay out at least 30% of earnings as dividends. Yara had to cut dividends from 13NOK to 10NOK in 2013 due to lower earnings but it has been raised back to 13NOK in 2015. The current dividend yield is at 3,12% (with a current price of 417 NOK). The dividend has increased 20,93% per year annualized.

[Graph of dividends and payout ratio](http://i.imgur.com/DG3LgOR.png)

 Yara also has a buyback policy in place to return more cash to shareholders. Yara aims to return 40-45% of net income through a combination of dividends and share buybacks. 

**Competition**

The following four companies are also operating in the plant nutrient field and are used for comparison.

* CF Industries produces and distributes nitrogen fertilizers and other nitrogen products. Yara and CF Industries recently talked about merging but it fell through.
* The Mosaic Company produces fertilizers mainly from phosphate. 
* Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan produces and sells fertilizers and related products to the agricultural industry. 
* Agrium produces, retails, and distributes crop nutrients, crop protection products, seeds, and agronomics.

[Competition vs. Yara](http://i.imgur.com/4163oLG.png)

 Looking at the numbers, Yara looks the best of the bunch due to a solid financial position and high dividend yield combined with the best RoC of the bunch. RoE is only mediocre but this is mainly a result of lower leverage.

**Risks**

Yara is very dependent on the agricultural industry. A slowdown in the cyclical agricultural industry will hurt Yara. 

 Yara is highly dependent on the price of natural gas. Right now Yara is thriving because of the fall in the price of gas but a new rally could hurt Yara. I expect that Yara will lock in the current, favorable prices or hedge against a rally over the short-mid term, but eventually an increase in natural gas prices will hurt Yara.

**Valuation**

I am going to do a relative valuation of Yara compared to its competitors and a dividend discount model to reach a valuation. 

[Relative valuation](http://i.imgur.com/LFsTFfI.png)

 Looking at all three multiples, Yara looks undervalued compared to its competitors. Yara's strong numbers combined with Yara's strong moat suggests that a higher valuation could be justified. I could see Yara being valued at 17-18 times FY2014 earnings (469-497 NOK / upside of 12-19% excluding dividend) if the strong Q4 results continues in 2015.

Assumptions for DDM:

* Three stage DDM model
* High growth for 5 years with dividend growth of 10% per year
* Transition period for 3 years
* Stable period with dividend growth of 3% per year
* Cost of equity of 9,49%. Calculated using Damodaran's method

Everything taken into account these numbers are fairly conservative and provide a good base case valuation. The result of the DDM is a fair price of 462 NOK equal to a P/E of 17 and an upside of 12%. 

**Summary and recommendation**

Yara International is a strong, healthy company thriving in the current economic environment. The future looks bright for the company, especially in the long term, due to exposure to several megatrends. Yara is thriving right now due to a high dollar and low gas prices. This has sparked a rally in the stock price over the last year and the company is currently trading at a P/E around 15 with a dividend yield at just over 3%. Looking at a relative valuation, the stock still looks slightly undervalued compared to its competitors and a conservative DDM supports this conclusion.

 My recommendation:

 Long term investors looking for a great companies at a reasonable prices can start accumulating at the current price. 

 People looking for great value opportunities can add to watchlist and buy on any pullback/correction.

*DISCLAIMER: I am a novice security analyst and even though I have worked on this analysis for quite some time, there is no doubt that I have overlooked something important. I advice you to do your own due dilligence before investing in Yara International.*

15-02-16,2w2we2,Stock Masrket Analysis:Eurozone ministers are to shed light on Greece’s situation,"Yet another meeting focusing Greece’s debt situation is to take place in Brussels during today. Eurozone ministers will continue the discussion on the situation in Greece, considering the upcoming expiry of Greece’s current economic stimulus programmer.

If no results to Greece’s financial problems are produced, there is a serious concern that Greece will be headed for a crunch that would force it out of the euro zone. Despite claims that leaving the Eurozone would be better for the Greek people, Mario Draghi, President of ECB refused to discuss the possibility of Greece leaving the single currency. The ministers will also discuss the economic situation in the euro land and will look into EU Commission’s winter forecast, which was published in the beginning of February as well as ongoing economic adjustment programs in Portugal and Cyprus.

As the meeting begins at 2 PM GMT (9 AM ET), it is not clear what time there will be any official announcements from the meeting but it is highly likely that this will move markets.

Technically speaking, EURUSD is traded in a 200 pip consolidation zone for the past 3 weeks with 1.1480 acting as resistance and 1.1280 as current support.

As the Eurozone ministers’ meeting approaches we expect higher volatility during this week with traders focusing on breaking the support at 1.1280, which could then see the pair being traded back in 1.10s zone. On the other hand it should be noted that a solid break and daily close above the resistance at 1.1480 could see the pair advancing to 1.1580 and thus it is imperative that protective measures such as stop orders should be placed when price approaches either boundary of the current consolidation zone.",6

15-02-17,2w6oib,Complicated...not sure if my partnership(self-employed) situation allows me to start a Solo 401(k) or if i have to offer a group plan.,"My biz partner and I partnered up almost 5 yrs ago and opened a Sushi restaurant and a concept company (LLC).  The Concept company is 100% ""owner"" of now 3 sushi bars (all 3 separate LLC's).  Each restaurant has roughly 40-50 employees which is on the individual restaurant's payroll.  Since the concept company is an LLC with zero employees, and we both file self-employed, can we start an Individual or Solo 401(k)?  Or is it, because the Concept Group ""owns"" the individual restaurants, with employees , so we have to look for a different group retirement plan?

Im looking to start some kind of retirement and have been doing a little research.  Im new to the investing thing but am getting really interested the more I read.

Another question...i could use some advice on a SEP and a Solo 401k (not eligible for Roth) or if there's a different route i should look at.  And, is this something i can set up or should i get a broker/advisor?  ",15

15-02-17,2w73e2,My Investments and Why,"So, I'm very new at investing, but I've been doing quite a bit of research (reddit, NASDAQ, WSJ, etc.) and am working toward building a portfolio.  With an initial investment of $5000, in two weeks, I've made a 10% increase, which isn't terrible IMO.  So here's what I'm currently investing in:

**AAPL** - Obvious reasons, really.  I feel like this year will be big for Apple, considering the solar farm they're building, the Apple Watch, and the unveiling of their new laptop later this quarter.  At the moment, I don't have a great deal invested in them (only 20 shares), but I feel like those shares will pay off. 

**DIS** - Seeing as The Mouse owns Marvel *and* Star Wars, their movie slate seems like a license to print money.  Again, only about 20 shares, but I feel that, come December, those shares will be worth a shitload of money.  

**THCZ** - This is my only ""wildcard"" stock.  Totally Hemp Crazy is a beverage company that's selling hemp-based tea, lemonade and energy drinks.  They're set for an initial production run this week and a launch of their e-commerse site as well.  With distribution deals through Amazon and a convenience store chain, it seems like their stock may jump this week.  True, I have 15,000 shares in them, but since the shares are currently $.034 (and rising), the risk is minimal (less than a $500 investment) for a potential massive return (if the stock goes up to even $.10 a share, I'll make bank).  

So...That's what I'm doing.  Thoughts?  I'm open to suggestions.

Since early 2013, the 3 year Treasuries rate has increased from 0.3 to 1.%, a threefold increase, but bond funds have increased in value over the same period, for instance IEI has increased 0.6% in that period.

Can someone please explain why this is, should not bond funds fall in value as rates rise? We have not seen that yet.

Anyway, the company did a 10-for-1 reverse split, leaving me now with 1,300 shares but the stock price still appears as $0.06. Shouldn't the reverse split increase the price to $0.60? According to my trading account and my portfolio in Google, my market value is only $78, but shouldn't it be more like $780?

15-02-17,2w88gx,"Company 401K isn't great but they contribute 3% regardless of whether I am paying into it. Should I contribute?","I've recently started researching investments and in-particular 401K plans, however a lot of my research isn't relevant to my situation and I would be very grateful for some tailored advice.

By default the majority of my 401K (~75%) is being invested in [WSTRX](http://www.morningstar.com/invest/funds/71670-wstrx-ivy-science-technology-r.html) (**Ivy Science &amp; Technology R**) and the remainder (~25%) is going in [ACESX](http://www.morningstar.com/invest/funds/60433-acesx-invesco-equity-income-r.html) (**Invesco Equity and Income R**).

After reading [this](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/investingtruths/investing-truth-about-cost) article about minimizing costs and the importance of low expense ratios I've become concerned about the fact that my 401K expense ratios are well over 1% (about 1.6% for WSTRX, where most of my money is going).

However, I am limited by the choices in my employers plan (through Mass Mutual). Here is the list of available funds I am offered:

[401K Fund Options 1](http://i.imgur.com/Ho1ucGd.png)

[401K Fund Options 2](http://i.imgur.com/WxbCH0B.png)


I've done some research into the options listed here and every single one has an expense ratio higher than 1% (in some cases a lot higher).

But I am constantly reading **""regardless of how shitty your 401K plan is... if your employer matches then you should contribute whatever is necessary to max out the employers contribution.""**

However my employer contributes 3% to my 401K no matter what, regardless of whether I am paying into it myself.

So I feel like I'm in a somewhat unique situation where the advice I'm reading everywhere doesn't apply to me. I'm tempted to open a Vanguard Target fund and contribute to that instead of my company 401k. I'm also curious if I should (can?) move money from my company 401K to something with a lower expense ratio (like a Vanguard Target fund).

**TL;DR:** *My employer is contributing to my 401K regardless of whether I contribute. I feel like my company 401K plan is shitty and would rather allocate money to something with a lower expense ratio. What is the wisest way for me to invest for retirement in this situation?*",3

15-02-17,2w8fm7,Cytokinetics [CYTK] up 26 % since Thursday,"Cytokinetics is a small biotech. I generally steer away from these due to the inherent risk, but they seem to have really solid fundamentals so the risk is muted to say the least. They also just shot up 26 % because of a recent earnings report. However, I feel like Cytokinetics may still have some value. They have cash on hand, and they have a ton of important decisions coming in from the FDA this week. Furthermore, two of the drugs in their pipeline have partnerships with large pharma companies (Astellas and Amgen). 

From the look of it, this seems like a really solid time to buy them, even if they just shot up. It's a small biotech, so there's obviously a certain level of risk, but whenever there was a drop, it seems that the investors just misinterpreted the FDA's decisions. For example, there was mixed news on their heart drug for Phase II trials. However, this bad news breaks down into two objective. It didn't meet the primary, but Cytokinetics is reworking their drug to be focused on the objective that it did well.

In short, I see potential. They seem to be undervalued as of right now. Especially since there are three near-term catalysts: 

* Tirasemtiv – FDA decision on Phase III primary endpoint in early 2015
* CK-2127107 – Announcement of initiation of Phase II trials in early 2015
* Omecamtiv Mecarbil – Primary data from Phase III in April 2015

* Not many people I talk to seem to be excited about getting one, though they acknowledge it'd be nice to check notifications without taking out their phones. So there is some openness to the concept.
* There is a social element to how new categories catch on. No one thought they would want an iPad (""so it's just a bigger iPhone? What would I do with it?"") but it was a huge success.
* People go crazy for Apple products. Literally, stomping on each other to get their latest gadgets. This might end up being more important than the actual merits of the product. 
* On the other hand: miniaturization has certain problems. There could be a big scandal over the battery life if Apple over-estimates it. It might have heat dissipation issues (especially because it's constantly communicating with the iPhone).

The solar industry is the only part of the stock market that I invest in, and I like to consider myself an expert.  I do not know the future.  Solar stocks are extremely volatile so a miss could send SCTY going the other way**

Let me explain why a short squeeze is probably going to happen:

1)Solar stocks have been sold off heavily due to the low cost of oil.  This is irrational as most electricity in the world comes from coal/natural gas.  They have both fallen in price as well, so everyone assumes this means cheap electricity.  This couldn't be further from the truth.  Most of the cost of electricity comes from the massive power plants and the thousands of miles of cables that it takes to transmit the electricity.  Fuel is relatively cheap compared to the other fixed costs. SolarCity CEO: http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000336386

But even if the utilities could drop the price, they wouldn't.  The only reason they ever drop the price is because the government forces them too.  They are a monopoly and your only other option is to stop using electricity.  They have no reason to pass the savings onto you.


2) The short interest has risen to near record levels.  It peaked about a month ago at a little over 40% and has fallen about 2% since then.  In June of 2014, it was at around 25% short interest.  SCTY beat the earnings then, and their was a squeeze.  SCTY rose by 40-50% in just a few days.

This time around, the short interest is much higher.  If it were to squeeze like it did last time, a gain of 60-80% would be reasonable.


3) People don't understand their business model.  SCTY bleeds a lot of cash, which is normally bad news for a company.  Instead of companies leaving it for dead, massive banks and even Google are throwing money at them.  It's not because they have gone crazy, it's just SCTY's business model is brilliant.  They build as much solar capacity as they can and then they lease it out to residential and commercial customers.  They don't charge anything for installation and your electricity bill drops right away.  This all has big upfront costs, but is about as safe as a loan.

Their business model is basically ""we will save you money for free"".  SolarCity then becomes that residence's utility and charges them for the electricity.  In the long run this will pay off much better for SCTY then just selling them outright.  In fact, I believe SCTY is already the biggest utility in the US.


4) The solar industry is rapidly improving.  The cost per watt of solar electricity is dropping like a rock and sales are booming.  All the companies that survive in the industry will thrive.  SCTY is my favorite stock in my favorite industry.  They have the largest share in the market and that matters big time.

In solar energy, a doubling of capacity usually leads to a reduction in price of 20%.  SCTY is scaling up their production much faster than any other company and that is going to pay off huge.  Once they have an advantage, its going to be hard to catch up.


5) I have watched many solar CEOs over the last week and none are preaching caution.  They all seemed confident and focused on the future.  To me this is a sign of overall strength this last quarter.

tl;dr: I'm expecting a beat on revenue leading to a short squeeze in SCTY.  There are a ton of shorts who don't understand the stock.  Great industry, great stock. Long SCTY!",20
15-02-17,2w8uir,"Let's think about this for a second - what if Apple builds a Supercar powered by Tesla?","Think about this - Apple is the master of taking niche spaces and making them stupidly profitable. Everyone is talking about GM, Ford, VW, etc. taking on Tesla by creating a competitor that will cater to the every man.

However, what I see is a very big opportunity for someone like an Apple (completely untested in the Automobile arena) to come out with a pure EV car that competes with the likes of a Porsche 911, Ferrari 458, Lambo Aventador, etc., clearly targeted for the upper+ class. They can use this entry (same as Tesla did with the Roadster) to lay out a ground work for their super luxury lines to take on the likes of Bentley, Maserati, etc.

Tesla will use this as an opportunity to build a partnership with Apple, and Apple could become a big investor in the company, which Tesla would use to fund expansion in other companies, building multiple Gigafactories (which could also be scaled to provide batteries for other Apple products), and potentially leverage their stores to market Tesla cars as well as theirs since they'll be in two different market segments.

That's all for this round of risky picks. If you have questions about why I chose the companies I did, check the original post. Much luck was involved.

Wanted everyone's opinion. I find when you only focus on 4-5 stocks to trade, there's less noise and you can focus more on patterns you see. In my case, FB has been profitable. 

I played today's bull run and got out when it hit the high. Transferred it into puts and doubled it in a day. (Obv I allocate my portfolio to my risk). Anyways, wanted to share. Anyone have any thoughts? FB is in the middle right now. If it pulls back to $73 it'll be perfect time to buy.

15-02-18,2wb9rj,understanding performance measures. how do i calculate my average risk-reward ratio? (for people who are a bit ok in math),"any other investors using the risk-reward ratio as a measure of performance? I am but have some difficulties in understanding how to compute it right.

so i have been trading on a demo account now for a while and about to do my first performance summary. in doing this i compute different performance measures, returns etc. based on the data i enter in my trading log for each trade i carry out. if my performance measures are looking good then i move on to a live account.

now to understand the risk-reward ratio completely i have two questions i hope some of you can help me out with.

i already understand easily how to compute the risk reward ratio of a winning trade using the following formula. which can be expressed by the following example. Reward/Maximum Risk = Risk-Reward Ratio. Example: If you bought 20 stock at 25$ and it went up to $29 per share and you make $4 for each of your 20 shares for a total of $80. You paid $500 for it, so you would divide 80 by 500 which gives you 0.16. That means that your risk/reward, for this idea, is 0.16:1. But in most cases you would have a stop loss on the trade risking perhaps only 100 which changes the calculation. 80/100 = 0.8 or 0.8:1. Or in very simple terms divide your profit amount with your risk amount. My goal is to have a risk-reward ratio of more than 1.5.

question 1) how do i compute a risk-reward ratio of a loosing trade? say price is going against me and i get stopped out. then my profit is negative and same size as the risk. e.g. stop loss is 2$ from entry price and price goes against me 2$ and i get stopped out. reward = -2$ and risk is also 2$. i mean this doenst make a lot of sense. in another scenario i would perhaps exit the market before the stop is hit so i take a loss of say 1.2$. so my profit would be -1.2$ and my risk 2$. first example the risk-reward would be -1:1 and in second example risk-reward would be -0.6:1.

question 2) how do i compute average risk reward over a number of trades? the table below shows profits, losses and risk-reward ratios of a number of fictive trades. firstly, i do not understand how to add the losing trades to the equation so how i do this is a mystery? secondly, i can see there are two ways of averaging these numbers. in one case you take the average of the risk-rewards themselves and in the other case you sum up the profits and losses and compute an overall risk-reward. how to interpret these two numbers differently? One could be called the ratio of the averages and the other the average of the ratios.

|Trade #|Risk $ (size of stop loss)| Reward $| Risk-Reward Ratio|
|---------|---------------------------|-----------|---------------------|
|   1      | 3                                 | 12         | 4:1                      |
| 2        | 18                               | 32         |  1.7:1                  |
| 3        | 200                             | -200       | ?                        |
|  4      |  50                               |   -20      |  ?                        |

The reason I say it's safe is that the drug is for patients with terminal brain cancer that is resistant to standard treatments. This is for patients in dire situations. It doesn't have to be able to cure cancer, it just has to show some efficacy (which it has) to get approved.

LNVGY: Releasing a lot of new products (spanning a wide price range for everyone), Motorolla should become profitable soon and is re-entering china. I'm expecting a pretty good year for them in general.

HRB: Tax season, its the first time anyone has to deal with Affordable care act in their taxes so their business should rise

DD: Nelson Peltz has an amazing track record with companies (Wendys for example). Also, hes trying to split Dupont which would be a best case scenario.

AAPL: Obvious reasons

WEN: They plan to reduce corporate owned stores to 5% by the end of the year, allowing more franchisees to come in. This will help boost the price, and I think Wendys will benefit from lower gas prices

LQ: This was probably my most stupid purchase. They're a US hotel chain that I think has growth in the long term. I bought them based on expansion plans for this year.

WFM: Massive expansion this year. Lower gas prices also means more people will spend here. But mostly they're expanding and I personally know that a lot of people who shop there live by them.

LUV: Again, MASSIVE expansion. I've taken a hit because I wasn't smart enough to wait for them to bottom out but I know in the long term I should see this stock provide some nice returns.

I'm incline to say 'bubble' but everybody and their mothers here in the Bay Area are using these apps and driving Teslas (or else calling Ubers in the city) and ordering from Munchery ($40mil) and drinking Soylent ($22mil, series A only) and renting out their AirBnBs ($800 mil, not fully legal) and checking into Foursquare ($162 mil @ Series D!).

15-02-19,2wecl1,Day trading: feedback on strategy,"So I've been investing for a number of years, and have generally held three portfolio types: 

1) bluechip, dividend growth companies that adhere to a certain criteria I've outlined in a methodology;

2) growth companies 

3) value stocks intended for medium-term holds (1-4 months) 

Over the last 2 years, I've added a 4th portfolio: a take on day trading.

The aim for this 4th portfolio is to take advantage of daily fluctuation, and make only 0.3 - 0.5% per trade (though I generally wind up averaging above this). 

I do the following:

* divided money in this portfolio into 10 trading lots (&amp; I occasionally use margin excess to trade with as well for an additional trading lot)
* invest exclusively in large/mega cap companies, vast majority of which are safe bluechip stalwarts that I've done due diligence on and I'm comfortable holding long-term should I need to
* no more than 2 of the 10 trading lots are invested in the same sector
* no trading lot is more than 3% of my total invested capital
* trade only companies that are in the fair value range -- which limits me a fair bit, as most companies are overvalued by my criteria currently -- but this limits the downside risk
* no trading on news, nor when earnings are coming out in the near future

I was curious, of course, as to whether this would be worth the time/risk. So the portfolio needed to outperform my other portfolios -- significantly, even. What I've found is that it doesn't take a great deal of time at all, and despite having several trading lots stuck for prolonged periods, the performance of the active trading lots will compensate for up to two 'inactive' trading lots in addition to itself, and still outperform.

...

So despite the seeming success of this, I'm wondering if I'm missing something. Why is this not a strategy employed more frequently? Or is it, and I'm unaware? Or am I missing something in that this is not a good strategy, and my performance has just been lucky to date?",26

15-02-19,2wek8t,Looking for advice: maximizing growth. Dividend yielding vs non-dividend yielding stocks.,"Hi all,
I just started investing this month. Spent about 10 days reading lurking around /r/investing. I made my first buy 15 days ago. (with ~$2600)

Today I crossed the 100$ threshold in unrealized gains! Thanks mainly to strangers on the internet like you.

I have some questions I hope some of you can shed some light on: 

My initial goal is to take the capital I have to invest and grow it aggressively with the end goal of accumulating a significant amount and then moving it to stable, income yielding investments. (Or cashing out if it ever makes sense for me to buy a house)

My question is, what is the most effective way to grow? 

I see a lot of people touting the magic of compound interest and stable dividends. But I'm inclined toward the view that young investors should be looking for more aggressive stocks with more potential for growth. (My biggest winners don't seem to have any dividend history)

Any advice?
Thanks!",3

15-02-20,2whp3a,"After the spur of recent posts here's a reminder to every trader/investor.","I don't want to sound like I'm lecturing or ranting but here it goes...

The recent spur of posts about profiting off of 'war stocks' (defense stocks for those of you playing at home with knowledge of the game) has made me remember something that I was told.

It's fine if you want to invest in defense securities (ATK, LMT, GD, and the like).  I hold some myself.  However always remember what you're investing in and why you're investing in it.  If you're investing in a company and HOPING for war, just so that company's stock price rises then you're doing it wrong.  It's an unfortunate reality that profit from human death is a possibility.  And should you so feel inclined to part-take in it, please don't do so for the wrong reason.

Some of you may be too young to remember this, but there was once a GIANT company called ENRON.  This company 'brokered' power (without simplifying it too much, energy futures) and by the end of it they were forcing blackouts on a whole state just to raise their share price.  They sacrificed ethics and morals solely for profits.  Netflix has a great documentary on it called ENRON: The Smartest Guys in the Room (well worth the watch for any investor).  A lot of investors and people in the company knew exactly what was going on.  The demise of ENRON led to thousands of people losing almost everything.

So when you're figuring out where to make a quick buck, remember to look beyond just what a security is priced at.

That's the end of my rant... [here's a picture of an adorable kitty](http://thepichost.com/data_images/out/25/8850447-cute-kitty-playing.jpg).

Nevada currently has it legalized, but I expected when it goes national you will have big time casino chains like Las Vegas Sands start up their own online casino poker rooms as a platform for customers. Perhaps with loyalty programs so when they spend so much they could get free rooms in vegas and what not.

I'm not high on Zynga unless they really consider going in the poker route. They already have Zynga Poker on Facebook and a mobile app. Electronic Arts also owns WSOP app so perhaps that might be another gaming stock that could take a slice of the pie.

I consitently see MS+X coming up and I just can't find anyone who can explain to me in a simple way what exactly these mid swaps are referring to (I understand that mid swap is the mid point of bid-offer spread on a swap). How would I then go on to make a judgement about whether to buy the bond?

Many thanks",1

15-02-19,2weyca,"How Can One Invest In Oil, But Avoid The Contango?","The current low prices of oil suggest that it's a great investment in the long run; however, please tell me if I've got this right:

1. To expose myself to futures, the only viable/possible option is to invest in ETFs, but the fund managers that run these ETFs (say USO) have to pay to renew their futures contracts when they expire... if the new months price is higher than the current months price, this results in a contango. All factors held constant, this would mean that the security USO will inevitably drop in price... correct?

2. There are other ways to invest in oil by purchasing stocks of certain companies in the oil and gas industry. But these certain companies are not to be used as derivatives for the price of oil as they are subject to their own earnings... correct? Are there any oil companies which stand out in particular? 

That all being said, which of these two routes is better? Investing in Oil ETFs or companies in the industry? Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Today GPRO had a big drop back down past the strike price i selected. It is currently trading at $45.20. Yet the premium cost has only gone up 10 cents from what i purchased it from?!

15-02-19,2wfgnd,Some info about the newly SEC approved Exchange Traded Managed Funds (ETMFs),"&gt;..the ETMF structure imagines something entirely different. ETMF shares are not traded like stocks, ETFs or ETNs; instead, they use a special-order type that books trades plus or minus an unknown end-of-day net asset value.

&gt;The structure, technically called “Nextshares,” theoretically brings many of the advantages of traditional ETFs. Because the shares are only bought and sold on the open market, like an ETF, they remove the shareholder servicing and 12b-1 distribution costs associated with traditional mutual funds. Because shares are created and redeemed through the ETF process, the tax advantages of ETFsare theoretically available to ETMFs as well.

[Eaton Vance ETMF A Step Forward, but..](http://www.etf.com/sections/blog/23753-eaton-vance-etmf-a-step-forward-but-.html) by Dave Nadig

&gt; Many have looked to SEC approval of non-transparent active ETFs to be a game changer in the industry, enticing more active mutual fund managers to enter the roughly $2 trillion U.S. ETF market. Others say it will be a while before the new breed of funds gains significant traction.

[SEC OKs Eaton Vance's new breed of ETFs, shares jump](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/07/us-eaton-vance-sec-idUSKBN0IR0K120141107) by Ashley Lau and Rishika Sadam

&gt;NextShares are a proposed new type of open-end fund combining features and benefits of active mutual funds and ETFs. Like actively managed mutual funds, NextShares seek to outperform their benchmark index and peer funds using their manager’s investment insights and research judgments. Like ETFs, NextShares utilize an exchange-traded structure with built-in performance and tax advantages. Different from actively managed ETFs, NextShares protect the confidentiality of their trading information to avoid front-running of fund trades, which can harm shareholder returns.

&gt;That means the key to the yieldco “game” is to convince investors that a capital intensive business is not capital intensive at all, says Kaiser in the report. Something mainly done, he adds, by convincing investors that things like depreciation don’t matter at all.""",2
15-02-19,2wgc5g,Why favor U.S. equities?,"The United States economy is somewhere around 25% of the global economy (give or take).  In light of that, why do most sources recommend that your portfolio have more than 50% or more of its equities in U.S. stocks?  What is the advantage of disproportionately favoring the U.S. market?

15-02-19,2wgls6,Currency risk and retirement abroad,"I understand that part of the reason that most people recommend weighting your portfolio in favor of domestic assets is that foreign assets add currency risk.  So I might, for example, have 2/3 of my portfolio in U.S. assets and 1/3 in foreign assets.

But what should I do if I decide to retire in a different country?  Am I now exposed to significantly greater currency risk because I am holding U.S. assets while I'm spending and living off a different currency?  Should I adjust my portfolio toward assets held in my new home country?  (Or at least shift away from a U.S. heavy portfolio and something more evenly balanced across all countries?)

And what if the new home country does not have well developed markets?  For example, if I retire in Indonesia, I probably would not want to switch 60% of my assets into Indonesian stocks and bonds.  Do most people just accept that they are now going to face greater currency risk?",0

15-02-19,2wgpjg,How to update stock info after merger (ORB+ATK=OA) in Google Finance,"On the 10th Feb, Orbital Sciences (ORB) merged with ATK, resulting in Orbital ATK (OA). The conversion rate from ORB to OA shares is 0.449. And of course the final value is rounded with shareholders being credited decimals. 

So my 140 ORB return 62.86, so 62 OA + 0.86 credit. 
And to calculate the credit I just need to know at how much were the stocks valued at conversion point. But how do you know that? 


According to Google Finance, [ORB](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:ORB) last close was at $28.85 while 
[OA](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:OA) seems to have first opened at $63.66. However 28.85/0.499 ~ 64.254 &gt; 63.66. So depending on which value you pick, you get a different result. 

I tried updating Google finance using 28.85 for the ORB sale, and 28.85/0.499 for the OA acquisition. But that results in a €30 withdrawal, when in reality, my account was credited €54.76. 

So how do you usually proceed in these situations?",1

15-02-20,2wj0xo,Keep An Eye On GENE!,"GENE - The Short Killer
-
First of all, we all know that GENE is up from promotion and squeezes. Well this is the first day of a pretty big hiccup. It did not rebound like all the other times and seemed to almost base at 9. I will explain what I think will happen tomorrow below. This stock is just insane, a short killer. This kind of stock is one that most people would say ""see this is why you don't short because you never know"". Well, you don't short blindly. This stock seemed to pullback a lot in the Australian market.

**Key things:** Most likely has a high amount of short volume, so squeezes are still a possibility. Float rotation stock (if you don't know what this is then research it). Lastly, it is almost always fakesout.

**Chart:** http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/quickchart/quickchart.asp?symb=GENE&amp;insttype=&amp;freq=1&amp;show=&amp;time=5

**Short Volume:**http://www.mightymarkets.com/short-volume-lookup/

-



Tomorrow 2/20/15:

**So my plan on the trade is?:** 

**Thought Process:**
To keep an eye on the pre-after market. If the stock holds below 9 and can't break above it, then it is a short. If it spikes in the morning failing to break 9, it is most likely a short (again it can fakeout, beware). Also could washout premarket, in this case a morning bounce is extremely likely.

 **Optimally I am looking for a big washout (hopefully pops SSR), then it will likely squeeze somewhere in the day because of the SSR (end of the day, or right as soon as SSR comes on).**  I will not say at what point I will get in and out, that's your job to figure out a good entry and exit! 

**Ignore GENE If:** It rebounds and holds 9, ignore it and move on.

*Please note that this is not an excuse for you to buy/short this stock, do your own research behind it! I am just letting everyone know about the stock!*

-

Edit: also this is the last ""Keep an eye on"" with my prediction for now! I hope that people understand that daytrading is not actually that hard. I only made a post like this to prove to people that you need to come with a plan on each trade.

**EDIT2 (important):** DO NOT TRADE GENE IF YOU ARE INEXPERIENCED AND DON'T UNDERSTAND STOCK MANIPULATION/FLOAT ROTATION. TRUST ME. IT CAN SQUEEZE AND TURN AGAINS'T YOU REALLY FAST. REMEMBER ALWAYS HAVE A PLAN, AND A  GOOD  SET RISK VS REWARD!",0

It made his parents furious that I was getting rich on his back, but he didn’t want to buy a place, didn’t have a dime for a deposit, so I considered it fair that he would contribute towards our living expenses.

Anyway, for a while, it was the two of us in a room, the roommate in another one, and a third guest bedroom where we had a desk, and most of our clothes in the closet. We did have a few guests that summer so it was nice to have a spare bed, but came September, students came back to the college town and I took a second roommate in.

We were just a little more cramped in the room, but the deal was with the extra rent my boyfriend would pay even less rent, and I would pay for treats like restaurants and travel, so he was on board pretty fast.

A year later, we broke up, I moved out and relocated to Morocco, and the two roommates stayed, with a third one moving into “my room”. I knew I wouldn’t be back anytime soon and wasn’t leaving any personal stuff behind, so I had no problems renting it. With the $875 I was getting by renting that room alone, I had enough to find a nice place on my own in Casablanca.

Fast forward five years, and the roommates have come and gone, and been generally good people looking after the place and warning me if something goes wrong. They have recruited their successor every time they moved out, and chosen those people carefully. In return, I have been a good landlady and changed heaters and washing machines as soon as they break.

The property is cash flow positive since I left, by a few hundred dollars each month. And this month marks the day the accumulated cash flow reached the price of the down payment I forked out when I first bought.

So basically, thank you, roommies, for buying me that property!

 

The feeling is great because now, this property cost me absolutely nothing. The rents have covered the deposit, the legal fees, the furnishing costs, the heater repairs… everything. I could sell it at any price and still make money since my cost is $0.

Imagine you get a $200,000 property and put $40,000 down. The $500 positive cash flow every month means that under 7 years, your tenants will have repaid your deposit back. At the same time, they are also repaying capital on your mortgage, slowly buying you the other $160,000 of the property.

That is why I love investing in real estate. If the bank was more understanding of my weird self-employment status, I would have more rental units, although managing a property from the distance can get complicated if you happen to get a bad tenant.

 

In the meanwhile, the rent surplus now more than covers my housing expenses in Guatemala, so not only am I getting a free property, they are also putting a roof over my head. Real estate is awesome.

 

Do you own a property? Do you see the positive cash-flow as your tenants paying off your down payment?",1

15-02-19,2wh4en,Very noob stock question.,"Okay, I've been recently thinking about getting into the stock market as a hobby. I've been thinking about purchasing stock in Tesla Motors. However, there is something that doesn't really make sense to me at the moment. 

The idea I have (the idea that many others have when getting Tesla stock) is that Tesla is more of a long term investment and it would be best to just purchase the stock and forget about it until Tesla motors has taken over the entire world lol. 

Anyway, what I don't understand is why the price of Tesla stock is currently at $211 when they are a relatively small and niche company. At the moment Microsoft stock is at $43 a share and they have already conquered the world several times over in a way of speaking. 

I don't understand is why Microsoft's stock value is so low compared to Tesla Motors'. Also, how much more could Tesla's stock actually increase if the company does overtake the market eventually?

There is something fundamental about the stock market that I obviously don't understand.  ",2

Stocks: SLCA, STNG, REX, GMLP, GLP, DK, DPM or COG. 

Cheers!  

Edit: update.  Thanks everyone for your input.  The general consensus is i should wait and perhaps maybe invest in something else and try to catch when oil stocks are going up.  I think I will wait.

I don't have the tools or the knowledge to explore this topic, but I'd be surprised if that didn't make these two some of the best performing companies of the current decade.

They're now pushing P/E ratios &gt;30, and they're paying dividends of less than 1% in a market where other large and respectable financial services companies are paying 2.5% or more.

What justifies this valuation? Why does everyone love Visa and Mastercard so much?

Where are they growing? I could swear that, five years ago, every human being in the western world already had a Visa card.

- They are looking to sell off ticket monster, potentially another half billion dollars coming their way.
- The company's annual revenue growth in the last quarter came in at 25% excluding currency, compared to 18% growth at Amazon and just 9% at eBay.
- Groupon is not only a daily deal site anymore, they are now firmly established as a supplier of goods, challenging competitors like amazon.
- Groupon's core operating cash flow increased by more than 160% on an annual basis in the company's last earnings report. That's insane.
- They have a much better app than amazon, in my opinion, and are good at targeting deals.  Their TAT on orders is getting very good too.

I think the stock is extremely undervalued and could see this stock at $15 by the end of this year.  Long term the possibilities are endless for groupon.  Thoughts? I know I am extremely bullish.

I got my dad to make one in his name, but linked to my email account and he transferred my 1500 dollars into it. I figure that it's just kid money I have saved up so I might as well have fun and get a new experience out of it. It has options enabled so I figured I would allow options trading too. I want to invest in appl (both stocks and options). I want to know where I can find all the different option types information and more general stock trading information. I have played stock simulators before, but I have no real life experience with paying taxes on my profits or any of that stuff. Does anybody have any advice on what I should do with the money? I'll be putting another 700 dollars into the account soon so I figured I'd put 500 into options and see how much I can make on apple. Thanks for the help guys. 

EDIT: Also, are there any potential problems I could run into investing my money in my dad's name?",2

15-02-20,2wkhrt,LB - L Brands - Q4 Earnings to be announced Feb 25th,"I should first say that I own a few shares of this stock, as requested by side bar. I bought in at $90.06 earlier this morning, and now it is up to $90.43 [2/20/15 @12:36 am EST], a .41% increase so far.

L Brands owns Victoria's Secret, PINK, Bath and Body Works, and a few other stores.

There is a constant trend of it's reported quarterly earnings per share (EPS) being slightly higher than the estimated EPS. And each Q4 of the past years, the reported earnings spiked. These are for obvious reasons, such as the men/women/parents buying clothing from Victoria's Secret to give to their significant others/loved ones.

The dividend is currently set at $4.00, which is a yield of 4.43%.

10 Day Average Volume is roughly at 2 million.

Here is some somewhat recent news, which is signaling more business for L Brands in the near future:
""In a tumultuous year for retailers that's already seen a slew of store closings and five bankruptcy filings, risqué lingerie shop Frederick's of Hollywood told The Wall Street Journal that it will close at least one-third of its stores, in an effort to turn around the business.""

Also, just recently, it scored an 83 in the American Customer Satisfaction Index Retail Report, which is above average, as well as the first year L Brands took part in that index report.

The CEO is a very good person, (Les Wexner) which is also good for the company. He donated/pledged a $100 million donation to his college, Ohio State. He started the company, which is always good, and many successful companies have spun off from him and his company.

15-02-22,2wqmq5,My take on valuating EA(Electronic Arts),"I am a newbie in valuation. So don't hurt meeeee

TLDR below
I’ll start with valuating EA. I will not be talking about the “story” of EA first. I’ll go quantitative first.
Using Benjamin Graham formula where:
Intrinsic Value = EPS x (8.5 +2g). (I’m not using Ben Graham’s new formula because for some reason, it gives super large numbers which seems a bit too crazy. This feels more realistic) Data is taken from Yahoo Finance.
EA is now at $57.67. It’s EPS is at 2.59. As for growth rate I’m using the 5 year estimate of 15.43%. 

After plugging in the numbers, EA’s possible intrinsic value is at **$101**. As you can see here, there’s quite a bit of an upside. EA’s ROE is pretty good as it stands at 36.11% while the industry stands at 11.1%. Debt to equity at 0.24. Profit margin is good as it stands at 19.02%. Cash flow is positive.

However there are some bad points, it’s P/S ratio is high as it stands at 3.98. Graham’s number says that a defensive investor should only buy this stock at $22 ish. PEG ratio is above 1.50 suggesting that it is overvalued. Also, **DCF valuation points it at $34.**


Now why particularly EA?

EA has a proven track record. EA has also survived many economic crashes and it’s still doing well. EA carries a healthy portfolio of games such as BF, NFS, FIFA, Mass effect and these games are well known and have ermm… “hardcore fanboys” This means EA has a sizable amount of brand loyalty. Also, with the new consoles, EA is also increasing its source of revenue. If you look at EA’s last quarter, the amount of sales generated from mobile and pc is almost the same. Mobile games are now on the rise as the world is quickly adopting smartphones. So there may be an untapped potential at developing countries. 

EA was infamously known for it’s microtransaction but was fortunately rectified by EA’s new CEO, Andrew Wilson. Andrew has increased EA’s share by 19% since he took over and now  (I believe) EA’s reputation is turning for the better as Andrew is more game focused rather than money focused. Origin is now snatching some market share for online gaming and is competing with other online stores such as Steam healthily. 

As compared to EA’s competitors like Take two interactive and Activision. EA’s balance sheet is the strongest and that’s why I think if you were to invest in a gaming company, EA seems to be a better choice.



TLDR



Bottom line, I feel that EA still has room to grow especially in gaming industry. EA has excellent brand loyalty and a good track record since its inception. However, its stock price is  tad high. If you are defensive I would suggest that you should wait for the price to go down to the $35 level while an aggressive buyer can buy it now as its stock price is reaching it’s 2008 high soon.

If I look at the last 5 years performance prior to 2014 it has been consistently raised roughly around %20 a year. Company is valued around ~$40b (though only one tenth of it is equity) and $4b revenues per year. I know that they do not have much net income as they invest every penny they earn into R&amp;D, which is not unheard of in this sector.

What I am curious is whether it's growth is the issue here or not. In 2014 it pretty much went nowhere except for some fluctuations despite %33 growth in its revenues. Looking into the past I do not see much difference. So I have two theories:

1. With the fear of possible decline of growth investors are worried and are being cautious. In this case fitting to previous model it's stock price could have been $75 per share.

2. It's growth really is to be stagnated, in which it is incredibly surprising the price can still roam around ~$60s. I recall worries of growth in facebook turned the stock from $38 to $17 in mere months, yet here I do not see such panic sell off.

I am a bit lost here and wanted to consult to wisdom of crowds.

But is there still worthwhile upside to this company, or is recent slew of negative news a forewarning of imminent long term downtrend?

With over 150 Million shares held, $AXP remains one of Berkshire Hathaway's top 3 holdings. Buffett is not getting rid of the stock, unlike he did with Exxon.

Another obvious downside is that merchants would rather see their clients use Visa or Mastercards, due to Amex charging higher transaction fees, which alone could contribute to ongoing unpopularity.

15-02-22,2wqxjy,Investing + Renting with 6mo track record or Mortgage?,"I didn't learn anything about investing growing up. It wasn't something my social class had the luxury of having as a concern. I managed to work my way out of that have been watching the stock market for a year or so, got a 401k and IRA going, but still had more money than I wanted to spend. So, I started investing small amounts about 6 months ago in individual stocks here and there. I keep a journal of my rationale and weekly progress, but so far nothing has been a loser, and my avg. mean 6mo return is 50%. My overall 6mo return is 80%.

That has to be crazy good luck, right? Everything I've read said to benchmark at ~4% annually over inflation (~3-4%). So, I've continued investing little bits here and there with the intent to sell enough of my lowest return shares to earn back what I bought in at, total of the intial buy plus tax, and reinvest in an index fund for safe keeping, and keep doing that with what I've been putting in monthly.

What I'm struggling with is my monthly rent; it is very high. Cheap in this area is $1500, and living conditions at $1200 are too sketchy to be a viable option. I can, however, buy a condo for ~$150k with fixed condo fees of about $200/mo. Using [this](https://www.khanacademy.org/downloads/buyrent.xls) tells me I should keep renting if my returns are even 1/3 of what they've been. Is a 6mo track record of half a dozen stocks a good enough indicator that my methods aren't completely bogus, and that I should keep renting and investing at my current rate with the hopes that my returns don't plummet? I'm not too fond of the risk involved with owning real estate anyway.

15-02-23,2wtjjw,Anatomy of a Pair Trade: Subverting the Risk Premium,"Hi folks,

This is about the short CCA.TO / long CGO.TO trade [I've been promising to make a post about ""soon""](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2rzfls/crowdsourcing_active_investment_management/co25w3s?context=1) [for about a month](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2t47q6/why_this_sub_will_remain_a_shitty_sub/cnvuyla). Sorry 'bout that. The borrow has been pretty spotty so I've been worried about a buy-in on CCA.TO. At this point I'm pretty confident that the lender's system is just messed up (I saw 30,000 shares available to short one day, 0 the next).



There are two things I want to explain in this post:

1) The fundamental and statistical methods by which I evaluated the Cogeco pair trade (and why I concluded it was a really spectacular opportunity)

2) How I moved from that theory to establishing a market-neutral position

Before I get into the details, I want to be clear about a few things: 

* I'm not a quant or a finance professional
* Since I'm not an expert, I don't know if any of the content of this post is *actually* correct
* My motivations for sharing include A) validating that my logic *is* correct and B) anybody who does execute this trade will help close the spread and therefore directly contribute to my trade profit. So open this trade at your own risk.

Just as a quick introduction to the assets: COGECO, Inc. (CGO.TO) is the Canadian parent of the Canadian cable company COGECO Cable, Inc. (CCA.TO). COGECO owns 32% of the equity in COGECO Cable, but maintains full control because the CCA.TO shares have subordinated voting rights.

So the big question here is, why would you ever go long one asset and short another if those assets should be equivalent? As our esteemed friend observes, [isn't that like going long GOOG and short GOOGL](http://i.imgur.com/m90MXyi.png)? If the assets are really equivalent, doesn't the EMH imply that there should be no expectation return from doing so?

The answer is that there's no expectation return *given an arbitrary starting time, and an arbitrary exit time*. Because the EMH is made up and there's actually a lot of meaningless noise in security prices, it is possible to identify trades with an expectation return quite a lot larger than zero.

In fact, [there's been a lot](http://money.stackexchange.com/questions/30005/does-it-make-sense-to-trade-my-googl-shares-for-goog-and-pocket-the-difference) [of talk about](http://seekingalpha.com/article/2223103-goog-vs-googl-a-classic-pairs-trade) [the GOOG/GOOGL pair trade](http://dealbreaker.com/2013/06/lets-hack-googles-share-split/). However, the spread between the two has never grown to the point that the risk-adjusted expectation return of the pair trade would outstrip the index so greatly as to be worth the hassle. This isn't a surprise, because Google's share volume is immense, the borrow is super easy, and there are tons of banks eyeballing it all the time.

The modest benefit the marginal buyer would get from purchasing the cheaper of GOOG or GOOGL has been sufficient to keep the two trading in a relatively tight band.

This happens not to be the case for COGECO.

---

Understanding the corporate structure is the first step in a trade like this, because voting rights may have some value. [Fortunately, the Canadian version of the FCC has done the heavy lifting already.](http://www.crtc.gc.ca/ownership/eng/cht043.pdf)

The conclusion is clear: Ms. Marie-Jeanne Audet controls the whole shebang, through her family office. Voting rights are pretty much irrelevant, since power isn't likely to transfer away from the Audets any time soon. So although there might hypothetically be more voting power (and therefore value) associated with a CGO share than a CCA share, it's probably negligible.

Next is validating CGO's 32% equity interest in CCA, and determining if there is a net positive or negative value associated with their other businesses (on the flowchart you will notice CGO's 100% controlling interest in local radio).

Here's [CGO's annual report](http://www.cogeco.ca/export/sites/cogeco/corporate/files/financial_annual_report_en/2014/ra2014e_cgo.pdf), and [CCA's annual report](http://www.cogeco.ca/export/sites/cogeco/corporate/files/financial_annual_report_en/2014/ra2014e_cca.pdf).

[Here's the relevant excerpt from the CGO report.](http://i.imgur.com/FoxAz05.png) It's clear that there is a 32% equity interest, and the 82.5% voting rights lines up with the CRTC flowchart.

But what are Cogeco Diffusion Acquisitions Inc. and Metromedia CMR Plus Inc? Does CGO itself have any operations? What is CGO's independent debt?

Consolidated accounting can make it a pain in the ass to figure the operations stuff out, [but fortunately CGO enumerates their debt](http://i.imgur.com/hl2MKfs.png). The parent company has $96.547 million CAD in excess debt.

In order to get a ballpark value for the independent CGO operations, I subtracted to get the yearly revenue from the non-CCA segment.

[Consolidated](http://i.imgur.com/9stHE5s.png)

[Cable segment (CCA)](http://i.imgur.com/GvVjNCW.png)

In 2014 the revenue attributable to CGO's non-CCA operations was $148.447 M CAD; in 2013 the differential was $141.791 M CAD. The Adj EBITDA was $14.905 and $17.919.

The EBITDA isn't headed in the right direction but the revenue is, and I'm fairly confident that those numbers fully justify the excess $100M or so of debt.

Alternatively, using the Shareholder's Equity values instead ($513.965 M CAD for CGO, $1508.256 M CAD for CCA), the ratio is 34%.

All in all it seems a very reasonable assumption that the fair market cap of CGO is *at least* 32% of CCA's market cap.

At Friday's close, the ratio stood below 28.6%, implying over 10% upside if the fair value is 32%. *Intredasting.*

___

So now it's on to the good part. Armed with a physical explanation for *why* the market cap of CGO ought to average around 32% of the market cap of CCA, the next question is, *does it*?

[Wolfram Alpha says ""yes"".](http://i.imgur.com/MY9CeMd.png)

But that isn't good enough... it's statistics time.

[A histogram of the daily adjusted close data from 1/3/2011 to 12/31/2014 looks like this.](http://i.imgur.com/13EmKOw.png) Shapiro-Wilk says it's not normally distributed, but Shapiro-Wilk breaks down for large n anyhow.

So this is a classic case of statistical ""good enough"".

(There hasn't been a lot of dilution in the past few years that would make it inappropriate to use price as a proxy for market cap).

Major take-away: the 95% CI for the population mean CGO/CCA ratio is (0.945, 0.950). μ = 0.947.

CCA closed at $76.49 CAD on Friday. CGO closed at $63.76 CAD, for a ratio of about 0.834. Again we see more than 10% upside.

CCA has 48.79M shares outstanding, and CGO has 16.73M shares outstanding, so the market-cap ratio implied by μ is 0.947 * 16.73/48.79 = 32.5%, which also agrees well with the 32% assumption.

The physically-implied value of μ (which I use instead, since it is a less aggressive assumption, and since the O-U estimate is better anyhow) is μ * 16.73/48.79 = 32%, or

**μ = 0.93322**

So clearly this is a profitable trade, and the risk is very small, since by going long CGO and short CCA you are completely market-netural. The important question becomes ""what is the expectation time for mean-reversion?""

___

An [Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornstein%E2%80%93Uhlenbeck_process) is defined as follows (italics indicate subscript):

dx*t* = λ(μ - x*t*) dt + σ dW*t*

Where λ is the speed parameter, μ is the mean, and σ is the volatility.

In other words, it's the continuous-time version of the AR(1) process. Simply, it is a time series which is expected to oscillate symmetrically about a mean.

The useful characteristic of the O-U process is the λ parameter. A fairly trivial proof will demonstrate that the half-life of the process (i.e., the expectation time for the CGO/CCA ratio to revert halfway to the mean) is equal to ln(2)/λ. So the goal now is to estimate λ.

A naive derivation of the discretized equation would look like this:

x*t* - x*t-1* = λ(μ - x*t-1*) Δt + σ dW*t*

x*t* = x*t-1* + λ(μ - x*t-1*) Δt + σ dW*t*

Since this fits the form y = a + bx + ε, it could then be regressed with ordinary least squares to obtain an estimate of λ, since λ = b / Δt.

However, [Gillespie points out](http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.54.2084) that this naive derivation is not correct for sufficiently small Δt. The corrected equation is

x*t* = (1 - e^(-λΔt))μ + e^(-λΔt) * x*t-1* +  σ √((1 - e^(-2λΔt)) / (2λ)) dW*t*

Fortunately, this still fits the y = a + bx + ε form, with b = e^(-λΔt) and therefore λ = - ln(b) / Δt. However, in this case, y = x*t* and x = x*t-1*.

[Performing the fit, b = 0.9548904, with a standard error of 0.0096.](http://i.imgur.com/tK7f5cU.png)

And so the estimate of λ =  b / Δt = - ln(0.9548904) / day = 0.04616 / day.

Then, the half life is ln(2) / λ = ln(2) / 0.04616 = **15.02 days.**

However, λ is a notoriously difficult parameter to estimate. As a sanity check, I propagated the 95% CI for b through to λ (statistics folks: any input on this?)

So the bounds are b ± standard error * 1.96 (Z-score at 95% confidence): 

0.9548904 ± 0.018816 = (0.9172584, 0.9737064)

So the 95% ""half-life interval"" would be (ln(2)/(-ln(0.9172584), ln(2)/(-ln(0.9737064)) or

**(8.03 days, 26.01 days)**

I prefer to use the high bound of 26 days to evaluate the opportunity.

___

So this brings us to the execution phase. By the most conservative estimates, it is expected that the ratio will collapse 0.0495 - half the distance from 0.834 to 0.933 - in no more than 26 days. In other words, if you were able to trade the CGO/CCA ratio directly, the expectation return would be 5.94% in 26 days, or an annualized return of **about 83%**. Moreover, there's essentially no risk involved, because these two companies are highly correlated - a large fraction of the change in the ratio is the mean-reversion ""signal"", and the Sharpe ratio would be astronomical.

Plus, downside risk is miniscule, since this is already a major excursion (~2.5 sigma).

Unfortunately, as I mentioned at the beginning of the post, getting a borrow is challenging. I (and anyone else who is a US resident) cannot trade Canadian options, [because the SEC is run by a bunch of dipshits](https://web.archive.org/web/20071029061139/http://www.futuresindustry.org/fi-magazine-home.asp?a=960). Anyone who *does* live in Canada can establish a synthetic short with CCA options and set up a pretty big position that way.

(I just had to wait until shares showed up and then grabbed them.)

In order to avoid exposure to CAD, I tried to set my net Canadian equity exposure to zero. In other words, the size of my long CGO position is equal to the size of my short CCA position.

So at Friday's close ($76.49 and $63.76), for every round lot of CCA I was short, I'd get short 100 * 76.49/63.76 = 120 shares of CGO.

The only weird quirk of this is that profit/loss will be denominated in CAD.

[Wolfram Alpha says ""yes"".](http://i.imgur.com/MY9CeMd.png)

But that isn't good enough... it's statistics time.

[A histogram of the daily adjusted close data from 1/3/2011 to 12/31/2014 looks like this.](http://i.imgur.com/13EmKOw.png) Shapiro-Wilk says it's not normally distributed, but Shapiro-Wilk breaks down for large n anyhow.

So this is a classic case of statistical ""good enough"".

(There hasn't been a lot of dilution in the past few years that would make it inappropriate to use price as a proxy for market cap).

Major take-away: the 95% CI for the population mean CGO/CCA ratio is (0.945, 0.950). μ = 0.947.

CCA closed at $76.49 CAD on Friday. CGO closed at $63.76 CAD, for a ratio of about 0.834. Again we see more than 10% upside.

CCA has 48.79M shares outstanding, and CGO has 16.73M shares outstanding, so the market-cap ratio implied by μ is 0.947 * 16.73/48.79 = 32.5%, which also agrees well with the 32% assumption.

The physically-implied value of μ (which I use instead, since it is a less aggressive assumption, and since the O-U estimate is better anyhow) is μ * 16.73/48.79 = 32%, or

**μ = 0.93322**

So clearly this is a profitable trade, and the risk is very small, since by going long CGO and short CCA you are completely market-netural. The important question becomes ""what is the expectation time for mean-reversion?""

___

An [Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornstein%E2%80%93Uhlenbeck_process) is defined as follows (italics indicate subscript):

dx*t* = λ(μ - x*t*) dt + σ dW*t*

Where λ is the speed parameter, μ is the mean, and σ is the volatility.

In other words, it's the continuous-time version of the AR(1) process. Simply, it is a time series which is expected to oscillate symmetrically about a mean.

The useful characteristic of the O-U process is the λ parameter. A fairly trivial proof will demonstrate that the half-life of the process (i.e., the expectation time for the CGO/CCA ratio to revert halfway to the mean) is equal to ln(2)/λ. So the goal now is to estimate λ.

A naive derivation of the discretized equation would look like this:

x*t* - x*t-1* = λ(μ - x*t-1*) Δt + σ dW*t*

x*t* = x*t-1* + λ(μ - x*t-1*) Δt + σ dW*t*

Since this fits the form y = a + bx + ε, it could then be regressed with ordinary least squares to obtain an estimate of λ, since λ = b / Δt.

However, [Gillespie points out](http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.54.2084) that this naive derivation is not correct for sufficiently small Δt. The corrected equation is

x*t* = (1 - e^(-λΔt))μ + e^(-λΔt) * x*t-1* +  σ √((1 - e^(-2λΔt)) / (2λ)) dW*t*

Fortunately, this still fits the y = a + bx + ε form, with b = e^(-λΔt) and therefore λ = - ln(b) / Δt. However, in this case, y = x*t* and x = x*t-1*.

[Performing the fit, b = 0.9548904, with a standard error of 0.0096.](http://i.imgur.com/tK7f5cU.png)

And so the estimate of λ =  b / Δt = - ln(0.9548904) / day = 0.04616 / day.

Then, the half life is ln(2) / λ = ln(2) / 0.04616 = **15.02 days.**

However, λ is a notoriously difficult parameter to estimate. As a sanity check, I propagated the 95% CI for b through to λ (statistics folks: any input on this?)

So the bounds are b ± standard error * 1.96 (Z-score at 95% confidence): 

0.9548904 ± 0.018816 = (0.9172584, 0.9737064)

So the 95% ""half-life interval"" would be (ln(2)/(-ln(0.9172584), ln(2)/(-ln(0.9737064)) or

**(8.03 days, 26.01 days)**

I prefer to use the high bound of 26 days to evaluate the opportunity.

___

So this brings us to the execution phase. By the most conservative estimates, it is expected that the ratio will collapse 0.0495 - half the distance from 0.834 to 0.933 - in no more than 26 days. In other words, if you were able to trade the CGO/CCA ratio directly, the expectation return would be 5.94% in 26 days, or an annualized return of **about 83%**. Moreover, there's essentially no risk involved, because these two companies are highly correlated - a large fraction of the change in the ratio is the mean-reversion ""signal"", and the Sharpe ratio would be astronomical.

Plus, downside risk is miniscule, since this is already a major excursion (~2.5 sigma).

Unfortunately, as I mentioned at the beginning of the post, getting a borrow is challenging. I (and anyone else who is a US resident) cannot trade Canadian options, [because the SEC is run by a bunch of dipshits](https://web.archive.org/web/20071029061139/http://www.futuresindustry.org/fi-magazine-home.asp?a=960). Anyone who *does* live in Canada can establish a synthetic short with CCA options and set up a pretty big position that way.

(I just had to wait until shares showed up and then grabbed them.)

In order to avoid exposure to CAD, I tried to set my net Canadian equity exposure to zero. In other words, the size of my long CGO position is equal to the size of my short CCA position.

So at Friday's close ($76.49 and $63.76), for every round lot of CCA I was short, I'd get short 100 * 76.49/63.76 = 120 shares of CGO.

If CCA decreasing was responsible for 1/2 mean reversion, the profit would be:

63.76 / (76.49 - x) = 63.76 / 76.49 + 0.0495 

x / (2 * 76.49) = 4.28759 / (2 * 76.49) = **2.80%**

If CGO increasing was responsible, the profit would be:

(63.76 + y) / 76.49 = 63.76 / 76.49 + 0.0495 

y / (2 * 63.76) = 4.28759 / (2 * 63.76) = **2.97%**

Most likely, it will somewhere in between due to the action of both.

Because the risk here is so low, it probably makes sense to use some margin (I did, about 1:1.6, so my expectation return is roughly 1.6x higher than calculated above). 

Assuming the 1.6x leverage, expectation return should be ~4.5% to ~5% in a month.

It's worth mentioning that a major quirk of this whole deal is that profit/loss will be denominated in CAD.

15-02-23,2wtmfe,Anatomy of a Pair Trade: Subverting the Risk Premium,"Hi folks,

Today I am going to provide an example of how I believe it *is* possible to beat the market... on a risk-adjusted basis.

This is about the short CCA.TO / long CGO.TO trade [I've been promising to make a post about ""soon""](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2rzfls/crowdsourcing_active_investment_management/co25w3s?context=1) [for about a month](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2t47q6/why_this_sub_will_remain_a_shitty_sub/cnvuyla). Sorry 'bout that. The borrow through IB has been pretty spotty so I've been worried about a buy-in on CCA.TO. At this point I'm pretty confident that the lender's AQS system is just messed up (I saw 30,000 shares available to short one day, 0 the next).



There are two things I want to explain in this post:

1) The fundamental and statistical methods by which I evaluated the Cogeco pair trade (and why I concluded it was a really spectacular opportunity)

2) How I moved from that theory to establishing a market-neutral position

Before I get into the details, I want to be clear about a few things: 

* I'm not a quant or a finance professional
* Since I'm not an expert, I don't know if any of the content of this post is *actually* correct
* My motivations for sharing include A) validating that my logic *is* correct and B) the fact that I directly profit if anyone else opens this trade. So open this trade at your own risk.

Just as a quick introduction to the assets: COGECO, Inc. (CGO.TO) is the Canadian parent of the Canadian cable company COGECO Cable, Inc. (CCA.TO). COGECO owns 32% of the equity in COGECO Cable, but maintains full control because the CCA.TO shares have subordinated voting rights.

So the big question here is, why would you ever go long one asset and short another if those assets should be equivalent? As our esteemed friend observes, [isn't that like going long GOOG and short GOOGL](http://i.imgur.com/m90MXyi.png)? If the assets are really equivalent, doesn't the EMH imply that there should be no expectation return from doing so?

The answer is that there's no expectation return *given an arbitrary starting time, and an arbitrary exit time*. Because the EMH is made up and there's actually a lot of meaningless noise in security prices, it is possible to identify trades with an expectation return quite a lot larger than zero.

In fact, [there's been a lot](http://money.stackexchange.com/questions/30005/does-it-make-sense-to-trade-my-googl-shares-for-goog-and-pocket-the-difference) [of talk about](http://seekingalpha.com/article/2223103-goog-vs-googl-a-classic-pairs-trade) [the GOOG/GOOGL pair trade](http://dealbreaker.com/2013/06/lets-hack-googles-share-split/). However, the spread between the two has never grown to the point that the risk-adjusted expectation return of the pair trade would outstrip the index so greatly as to be worth the hassle. This isn't a surprise, because Google's share volume is immense, the borrow is super easy, and there are tons of banks eyeballing it all the time.

The modest benefit the marginal buyer would get from purchasing the cheaper of GOOG or GOOGL has been sufficient to keep the two trading in a relatively tight band.

This happens not to be the case for COGECO.

---

Understanding the corporate structure is the first step in a trade like this, because voting rights may have some value. [Fortunately, the Canadian version of the FCC has done the heavy lifting already.](http://www.crtc.gc.ca/ownership/eng/cht043.pdf)

The conclusion is clear: Ms. Marie-Jeanne Audet controls the whole shebang, through her family office. Voting rights are pretty much irrelevant, since power isn't likely to transfer away from the Audets any time soon. So although there might hypothetically be more voting power (and therefore value) associated with a CGO share than a CCA share, it's probably negligible.

Next is validating CGO's 32% equity interest in CCA, and determining if there is a net positive or negative value associated with their other businesses (on the flowchart you will notice CGO's 100% controlling interest in local radio).

Here's [CGO's annual report](http://www.cogeco.ca/export/sites/cogeco/corporate/files/financial_annual_report_en/2014/ra2014e_cgo.pdf), and [CCA's annual report](http://www.cogeco.ca/export/sites/cogeco/corporate/files/financial_annual_report_en/2014/ra2014e_cca.pdf).

[Here's the relevant excerpt from the CGO report.](http://i.imgur.com/FoxAz05.png) It's clear that there is a 32% equity interest, and the 82.5% voting rights lines up with the CRTC flowchart.

But what are Cogeco Diffusion Acquisitions Inc. and Metromedia CMR Plus Inc? Does CGO itself have any operations? What is CGO's independent debt?

Consolidated accounting can make it a pain in the ass to figure the operations stuff out, [but fortunately CGO enumerates their debt](http://i.imgur.com/hl2MKfs.png). The parent company has $96.547 million CAD in excess debt.

In order to get a ballpark value for the independent CGO operations, I subtracted to get the yearly revenue from the non-CCA segment.

[Consolidated](http://i.imgur.com/9stHE5s.png)

[Cable segment (CCA)](http://i.imgur.com/GvVjNCW.png)

In 2014 the revenue attributable to CGO's non-CCA operations was $148.447 M CAD; in 2013 the differential was $141.791 M CAD. The Adj EBITDA was $14.905 and $17.919.

The EBITDA isn't headed in the right direction but the revenue is, and I'm fairly confident that those numbers fully justify the excess $100M or so of debt.

Alternatively, using the Shareholder's Equity values instead ($513.965 M CAD for CGO, $1508.256 M CAD for CCA), the ratio is 34%.

All in all it seems a very reasonable assumption that the fair market cap of CGO is *at least* 32% of CCA's market cap.

At Friday's close, the ratio stood below 28.6%, implying over 10% upside if the fair value is 32%. *Intredasting.*

___

So now it's on to the good part. Armed with a physical explanation for *why* the market cap of CGO ought to average around 32% of the market cap of CCA, the next question is, *does it*?

[Wolfram Alpha says ""yes"".](http://i.imgur.com/MY9CeMd.png)

Macro Trading Has a New Power Tool: Peer to Peer, Counterparty Risk-Free Swaps for Value Transfer &amp; Trading

Trade the value of over 45,000 tickers of instruments in every asset class from every major geography and exchange with up to 10,000x pricing leverage without concerns of counterparty/credit/default risk or margin calls. Very big claims… substantiated by a very big discovery in value transfer and security.

Veritaseum is the worldwide leader in the financial implementation of “smart contracts” – unbreakable, self-executing bilateral agreements between two or more parties. We use these smart contracts to create peer to peer swaps for the transfer of value through the “blockchain,” a worldwide, open ledger of pseudonymous transactions that can be seen and audited by anyone, any time in the cloud. The blockchain is considered unhackable and one of the most secure implementations of cryptography to date.

With the use of financial “wallets”, client side applications that use a simple interface to guide users in the quick (as in minutes – enter ticker(s), amount to risk, collateral, expiry and leverage required) creation of a smart contract (in this case a P2P swap), users trade OTC directly with other parties – totally bypassing and intermediating exchanges, with even less risk. Monetary value is committed up front, a leverage factor is digitally dialed in (anywhere from 2x to 10,000x) and the smart contract is created and sent to the blockchain to await a match. Once matched, the funds are locked into the transaction until expiry, at which point profits and losses are distributed along with principal and unused collateral (the capital chosen to be put at risk). A novel, risk averse, extremely powerful, and quite frankly - ingenious way to trade macro strategies.

Not only can one go long or short any ticker in any asset class from any region for any currency, one can go long one ticker relative to another. For instance, those with a bearish outlook on the S&amp;P 500 normally short it for USD. You can now short (pay) the S&amp;P 500 index directly while going long (receiving) Eurozone equities (or 10 year treasury yields, or Swiss francs or the CNYJPY pair or bitocin), in a single transaction – with or out without leverage.

Since the exchange is peer to peer, we never hold or control any of your assets, hence you are not exposed to our balance sheet, credit, default or counterparty risks (the blockchain is your effective counterparty). Veritaseum is a software concern, not a financial concern or intermediary! You can always track your assets and trade through the blockchain at any time. The capital is loaded in the wallet in the form of bitcoin, and for those who choose to minimize exposure to bitcoin market price volatility, leverage can be used to nearly eliminate the noise. You can also conduct trades using a demo mode and test coins, so as to use the system without risking actual capital.

# Smart Contracts as Transaction Vehicles: The Safest Possible Way To Exchange Value #

Veritaseum's UltraCoin smart contracts are:
1. highly flexible - you design your own derivatives yourself using your own parameters via our simple graphical user interface
2. self-executing
3. autonomous
4. unbreachable: we call them, the unbreakable promise! They are backed, fortified and stored by/on the blockchain itself
5. uber-transparent: simple click the ""trace transaction"" button to find the location and historical travel path of your assets anytime, from anywhere you have an internet connection

# Trading Through a Balance Sheet-Based Financial Institution vs. Distributed, Decentralized, P2P Software Concern #

What I do want to accomplish is the education through the fact that the Bitcoin protocol has given rise to the genesis of a new type of company, with a new business model that can offer a totally new type of product. As you were able to see from above, Veritaseum's UltraCoin offers a very uniquer product with many if not all of the attributes that potential competitors offer, with a slew of attributes that others can't touch. This is done at 1/5th of the price and at much less risk!
When dealing with Veritaseum's UltraCoin, you can never get Gox'd because we never have (nor do we want) possession of your coins or fiat - every, at any time. Because we don't user our balance sheet (we are a software company, not a centralized exchange or broker/dealer) you:
 
- are never exposed to us as a counterparty, we make the blockchain your counterparty

- never have to worry about our capital reserves or the capitalization/credit of your initial counterparty (all trades are fully funded at the outset, even a heavily levered trade at 10,000x), 

- You never have to worry about negative drawdowns, negative equity or margin calls
- If a catastrophic event were to occur, say bi-coastal earthquake takes out our datacenters on the east and west coasts simultaneously while a meteor hits the backup center in the midwest, you will still be able to recover you funds - on your own. Since we do not have possession of your funds you don't have to worry about us absconding with them nor getting blown up with them. Each trade has a catastrophic rollback feature which will put you back into your original funding position n-time units after expiry. Unfortunately, you will not be able to complete your trade, but if two bi-coastal trades hit at the same time as meteor to the mid-west, you may not be studying that EUR short anyway :-)

15-02-23,2wtsmy,Women Into Investing Part II: PF Bloggers,"There are a lot of great blogs out there that go into detail about how to invest and some of them even share what’s in their own personal portfolio.

However, one thing I noticed was that the people who mostly talked about investing in detail were guys. I have yet to find a blog focused solely on investing written by a female. If you know of one, please msg me or email me with the link!

So I decided to ask some of my favourite female pf bloggers what their thoughts were on women and investing. I asked them to share their thoughts about women and investing in general and/or answer one or both of the following questions:

1. What advice would you give to female investors?

2. What do you think are some reasons why women don’t invest in their finances?

In no particular order, here are their responses:

 

Anne from Money Propeller

1. Get out there and learn!  Start with index funds or ETFs, you can even stick with them forever if you would like.   Look up a fee only adviser and go talk to one, then think about what they said.  Ask some friends for their opinions, ask some forums for their opinions and then do what feels right for your situation.  
2. I think a lot of women are intimidated and women are more risk averse than men, so don’t tend to charge in with a cavalier attitude.  It’s really unfortunate, because there are a lot of great resources out there, including local folks. 
 

Sherry (saverspender) from Save. Spend. Splurge.

Don’t think you’re not smart enough or need to be very mathematically inclined to be able to invest, like holding a PhD in mathematics or something.
 

I am not a mathematically inclined person but I asked tons of questions no matter how dumb I sounded to understand as much as I could; to be honest I still don’t know what some of the more complex investing terms mean but they’re irrelevant for a regular investor like you and me; you don’t need to be an investment banker to invest your money.
 

If you don’t understand something then it means it is not being explained to you in a simple enough manner.
 

I recommend getting a list of beginner investing books to read (have a list on my blog @www.savespendsplurge.com/the-only-personal-finance-books-you-should-ever-have-to-read-in-your-life/ ) and avoid thinking that investing means knowing how to pick the next hot stock. 
Investing is simply learning how to manage your money so that it grows and that includes passive investing like putting your money in index funds (what I do with the bulk of my cash).
 

Women are afraid of investing because they are paralyzed by being aware that they don’t know anything and they’re scared of making a mistake and losing all their money. None of this applies if you follow an investing strategy that works for your level of risk and investing knowledge.Please don’t use your sex as an excuse either because TRUST ME, men do not have the monopoly on being able to understand money management in all of its aspects – there are plenty of clueless guys out there who are guessing and pretending to be savvy investors which is even worse than admitting you’re clueless.
 

Know what you don’t know and start learning a bit at a time by asking questions.
 
 
women can invest
Vintage image of Rosie the Riveter by J. Howard Miller.

Pauline from Reach Financial Independence

My advice for female investors is just to get started, for example index funds are very simple to manage, and you can have an automatic transfer on pay-day directly into your investment accounts to dollar cost average and have the opportunity to keep on buying more if prices drop. Just forget about it and watch it grow!
 

For me the reason women don’t invest too much in their finances is because financial education is poor in general, and if you have always relied on your parents or significant other, you don’t feel it is too important to care for yourself. But you never know what can happen, you could end up single again, with kids and a household to take care of, so I can’t insist enough on the importance of getting started.
 

Bridget from Money After Graduation

To be honest, I’m not sure why women don’t invest or invest differently than men. Money doesn’t care what your gender is. The stock market isn’t going to treat you differently whether you’re a man or a woman.  I think the lack of confident female investors is a symptom of larger problems — the fact that women often earn less than their male counterparts in the same profession, or the myth that women aren’t as good as men at math. The advice I would give female investors is the same as that I would give male investors: start early, be diligent, and remember less is more when it comes to trading frequency!
 

Taylor from Engineer Cents

1. I think many women don’t invest because they are risk averse, at least when compared to their male counterparts. They talk themselves down, don’t think they are “good with numbers” or have enough experience to get into it. And so they don’t, which is a shame because by fearing loss, they end up falling behind anyway because of factors like inflation.
 

2. Start small and use target funds through a provider like Vanguard if you’re a beginner, or choose an investment vehicle you are most comfortable with. But whatever you do, start! Also, keep in mind that at some point in your investing lifetime, you will lose money; don’t sell while the market is down! Remember that averaged out over a long period of time you will more than likely come out ahead.
 

Sarah from Unsettle

1. There is a lot to learn about investing but don’t let not being an expert hold you back from investing your first dollar. It’s easy to fall victim to analysis paralysis in investing and sometimes the best way to learn is in the trenches. 
 

2. I think a lot of it is that people in generally – and maybe especially women – think they don’t know enough and assume that the learning curve is quite high. 
 

Also, studies show that women tend to be a bit more risk averse than men. 
 

Alicia from Financial Diffraction

As a late 20’s woman, I started investing because of a mandatory retirement plan through my employer. I had read about investing before, but I was stuck in an analysis paralysis loop, where I wanted everything to be perfect before I put my money in the market rather than getting a basic investing education and then learning more as I went along – I wanted to be an expert overnight. From talking to my female friends, I think the fear of the unknown, feeling like we’re not fully in control, and that everything requires perfection really hinders women from making the jump from saving money to investing. It doesn’t have to be perfect. Educate yourself on index investing, and throw your money in a low-cost index fund while you learn the more complex issues; if by the end of your investing education you’re still not comfortable with more than the “set it and forget it” mentality of indexing, that’s fine, but you won’t have put off your investing for another few years while you try to get everything “perfect”.
 

Michelle from Making Sense of Cents

1. My advice would be to just start investing. Even if all you have is $100 to invest, it is important to start as it can quickly become addicting to watch your investments grow. Everyone has to start somewhere, right? That first step can feel hard, but once you overcome it you will realize that investing is not so scary.
 

 
2. I think a big reason for why women don’t invest is because the first step of investing that I mentioned earlier can feel so scary. Investing can seem so foreign if you’ve never done it before, and that can feel very overwhelming.
 

 Mel from brokeGIRLrich

1. I think part of the issues is to just do it. Do some research, decide how much you’re going to invest and then get it done. If you select a solid company, odds are good you’ll do fine. Or forget about companies altogether and invest in index funds or target date funds. At the end of the day, you’ll always wish you started something that was good for you yesterday. You might as well make that day today. 
 

2. I think investing can seem really overwhelming. How do you pick what you want to invest in? And then where do you do it? How do you find a decent brokerage firm? There are a lot of questions that take some time to figure out how to answer. I think we also have more conservative approaches to money than a lot of men do. 
 

 Lauren from LBee and the Money Tree

My best advice to female investors is to take your time. If you don’t know what you’re doing, put your money into a target date fund that adjusts risks based on your retirement date. 
 

I think women don’t invest in their finances out of fear of failing at them. Ironically, as long as you are cognizant of your money, there is no way you can fail.
 

Stefanie from The Broke and Beautiful Life

I’d recommend women invest the same way as I’d recommend to anyone else- early on with a well-diversified set it and forget it approach.  As a millennial, I find women are as proactive with their finances as their male counterparts.  Unfortunately, I don’t see much investing from the generation as a whole.  Probably because they’re wary of the market from reaching financial independence at the height of the 2008 recession.
 

Erin from Journey to Saving

1.  My advice is to educate yourself. If investing seems intimidating, take confusion out of the equation by learning. There are tons of free resources out there that you can use to get started! You don’t have to go all in, either – take baby steps and ease yourself into the market. 
 

2.  I think being nervous is a big reason women don’t invest. Putting your money at risk in the market is difficult, but it’s necessary to grow wealth. I also think there’s an assumption that men should take care of investments, but the money is yours, too! You need to get involved. 
 

Crystal from Budgeting in the Fun Stuff

2.  I stick with the target date mutual funds and real estate because the research involved to intelligently invest in individual stocks seems overwhelming to me.  My husband relishes in finding reviews, data, and historical trends.  I see all of that as pure tedium.  Like doing taxes.  He does that too.  My grandma, my mother, and my uncle are all fantastic with stocks.  I just rather buy another rental property to go along with our first one some day…",1
15-02-21,2wngo0,"Kroger's (KR) Market Leaps","I've owned Kroger at two different buys, once around $29 and another at $41. Needless to say, I wish I bought a lot more as I just hit the 100% gains mark. The ticker has surged over the last couple of years without any huge declines. Their ER is under two weeks away, but at this price, do you believe they're still a solid buy? Also, there hasn't been a stock split since '99 and there isn't much news on the topic of another split but a 2:1 (or even 5:1) doesn't seem unreasonable given their price is much higher than it's ever been.",14
15-02-22,2wr4bv,Free information on options,"Hi guys, 
 I am a senior in college studying mathematics and economics. I figured since I have seen a lot of questions about resources to learn about options trading I would put myself out here if anyone wants to chat. I am currently taking an upper level financial engineering course all about options thats got me really excited to learn all I can! 
I have been working with TD Ameritrades platform thinkorswim, if you dont have it stop whatever your doing and get it. Its an incredible free resource for options trading! In the help section there is a learning center with so much information its had my nerdy panies in a bunch for weeks. They also offer courses if your into spending some money. The courses are pretty expensive but the teachers and the resources are excellent. I attended a weekend lecture as a guest with a friend of mine who had purchased the package (yes, you get to bring one free guest and I was lucky) and I couldn't get over the energy in the room even at the end of an almost 6 hour lecture. 
Key point! While at the lecture I talked to a lot of successful people who trade as a living. One thing almost everyone told me ""I lost and lost and lost until I youtubed technical analysis"" Youtube is a huge pile

 of information and I think a lot of traders sign up for some crazy learning package for cash when they could save a ton and youtube search anything. I suggest learning at least 4 studies before you trade. Quadruple check yourself before you wreck yourself. 
Last thing I have got to say. I have a pdf that has a great explanation of the  mathematics of pricing if anyone is into heady math and wants it let me know and we can exchange emails!",0
15-02-22,2wr4x3,"Looking for Beta Users for Groundbreaking P2P Swap Trading System, Maximum Leverage, Minimum Risk, All Markets","I'm looking for traders to take positions (either in agreement with, or contrary to) my research/opinion or using your own trade setups and fundamental/macro outlook - via our P2P swap platform. You can use actual capital or I can give you test capital, basically, play money, to trade with me and my team and all I ask for is feedback on the system and the ability to quote you (which is not mandatory, but it would be nice). You can trade stocks, bonds, commodities, forex and forex pairs long or short, or swap the exposures directly for another asset, ex. S&amp;P 500 for the LSE 100, Apple for Google, etc. Fees start at 5 bp, the best available from anywhere. Digital leverage is available, up to 10,000x worth (double digit profits/losses can be had from 11 basis points in movement, or less - so be careful), with no possibility of a Margin Call since the trades are pre-funded.

Macro Trading Has a New Power Tool: Peer to Peer, Counterparty Risk-Free Swaps for Value Transfer &amp; Trading

Trade the value of over 45,000 tickers of instruments in every asset class from every major geography and exchange with up to 10,000x pricing leverage without concerns of counterparty/credit/default risk or margin calls. Very big claims… substantiated by a very big discovery in value transfer and security.

Veritaseum is the worldwide leader in the financial implementation of “smart contracts” – unbreakable, self-executing bilateral agreements between two or more parties. We use these smart contracts to create peer to peer swaps for the transfer of value through the “blockchain,” a worldwide, open ledger of pseudonymous transactions that can be seen and audited by anyone, any time in the cloud. The blockchain is considered unhackable and one of the most secure implementations of cryptography to date.

With the use of financial “wallets”, client side applications that use a simple interface to guide users in the quick (as in minutes – enter ticker(s), amount to risk, collateral, expiry and leverage required) creation of a smart contract (in this case a P2P swap), users trade OTC directly with other parties – totally bypassing and intermediating exchanges, with even less risk. Monetary value is committed up front, a leverage factor is digitally dialed in (anywhere from 2x to 10,000x) and the smart contract is created and sent to the blockchain to await a match. Once matched, the funds are locked into the transaction until expiry, at which point profits and losses are distributed along with principal and unused collateral (the capital chosen to be put at risk). A novel, risk averse, extremely powerful, and quite frankly - ingenious way to trade macro strategies.

Not only can one go long or short any ticker in any asset class from any region for any currency, one can go long one ticker relative to another. For instance, those with a bearish outlook on the S&amp;P 500 normally short it for USD. You can now short (pay) the S&amp;P 500 index directly while going long (receiving) Eurozone equities (or 10 year treasury yields, or Swiss francs or the CNYJPY pair or bitocin), in a single transaction – with or out without leverage.

Since the exchange is peer to peer, we never hold or control any of your assets, hence you are not exposed to our balance sheet, credit, default or counterparty risks (the blockchain is your effective counterparty). Veritaseum is a software concern, not a financial concern or intermediary! You can always track your assets and trade through the blockchain at any time. The capital is loaded in the wallet in the form of bitcoin, and for those who choose to minimize exposure to bitcoin market price volatility, leverage can be used to nearly eliminate the noise. You can also conduct trades using a demo mode and test coins, so as to use the system without risking actual capital.

# Smart Contracts as Transaction Vehicles: The Safest Possible Way To Exchange Value #

Veritaseum's UltraCoin smart contracts are:
1. highly flexible - you design your own derivatives yourself using your own parameters via our simple graphical user interface
2. self-executing
3. autonomous
4. unbreachable: we call them, the unbreakable promise! They are backed, fortified and stored by/on the blockchain itself
5. uber-transparent: simple click the ""trace transaction"" button to find the location and historical travel path of your assets anytime, from anywhere you have an internet connection

# Trading Through a Balance Sheet-Based Financial Institution vs. Distributed, Decentralized, P2P Software Concern #

What I do want to accomplish is the education through the fact that the Bitcoin protocol has given rise to the genesis of a new type of company, with a new business model that can offer a totally new type of product. As you were able to see from above, Veritaseum's UltraCoin offers a very uniquer product with many if not all of the attributes that potential competitors offer, with a slew of attributes that others can't touch. This is done at 1/5th of the price and at much less risk!
When dealing with Veritaseum's UltraCoin, you can never get Gox'd because we never have (nor do we want) possession of your coins or fiat - every, at any time. Because we don't user our balance sheet (we are a software company, not a centralized exchange or broker/dealer) you:
 
- are never exposed to us as a counterparty, we make the blockchain your counterparty

- never have to worry about our capital reserves or the capitalization/credit of your initial counterparty (all trades are fully funded at the outset, even a heavily levered trade at 10,000x), 

- You never have to worry about negative drawdowns, negative equity or margin calls
- If a catastrophic event were to occur, say bi-coastal earthquake takes out our datacenters on the east and west coasts simultaneously while a meteor hits the backup center in the midwest, you will still be able to recover you funds - on your own. Since we do not have possession of your funds you don't have to worry about us absconding with them nor getting blown up with them. Each trade has a catastrophic rollback feature which will put you back into your original funding position n-time units after expiry. Unfortunately, you will not be able to complete your trade, but if two bi-coastal trades hit at the same time as meteor to the mid-west, you may not be studying that EUR short anyway :-)

I would like to perform some Monte Carlo simulations myself. Just for fun, i will not make any investing decision on this.

As far as I know, market movements do not resemble any known distribution. Bull and Bear years do not alternate randomly. Before a crash happens, there are usually several Bull years. And a crash seems to be followed by strong Bull years to even out underevaluation.

So how are the numbers for Monte Carlo simulations generated?",94

Ibio – bounce play after big pumpup over 1, could parabolic to 1 over and under. Only short parabolic moves as this stock could very well keep going!

CRMD – Up a ton, expecting a parabolic to 5 over and under with a good risk on the peak of the spike!

ARIA – morning parabolic to 8.50 over and under. Back side of move could be very possible with a stock like this where it seems to be holding a trend after a big move.

CSLT – Is bounce plays were people are anticipating a bounce off a huge drop. Expecting a 7.50 over and under with a strong pullback. Avoid shorting back side of move as this stock could have a big range to it.

HZNP – broke 17 resistance after a few months of holding it. Expecting a parabolic to 19 – 19.50’s with a pullback. Do not short back side of move.

15-02-23,2wu70j,Non performing secondary note sellers,"Years ago I purchased a non performing secondary mortgage from a company who was selling training courses on how to rehab these kinds of paper. If you bought the course, a really risky note was included. Mine was about 150+ late, under water, and no contact could be made with the owner for months and months. About 23k in debt for 200 dollars. 


The company that originally sold this to me has since increased their asking price for notes of this quality to a level that frankly makes no sense to me. So my question is, does anyone know of a reputable company that sells non performing secondary mortgages on a retail level?

15-02-21,2wnskd,Value Investing - When are Rising Prices Good for Buying?,"So I just had an epiphany of sorts.  I've always held onto the believe that if you're a net buyer of a stock, then you'd like for the price to go down.  And if you're a net seller of the stock, then you'd like for the price to go up.  What I hadn't considered before, and this is strange because it seems so obvious now, is that if you're a net holder of a stock, then you'd like for the price to go up.

Let's use some extreme examples to help illustrate the point.  Let's say AAPL is trading at $130 and you believe it's buyable up until $150.  You currently own 0 shares and you wish to buy 10 shares.  But then the price jumps $10.  Clearly that's bad.  You were a net buyer and the stock price went up.

In this next example, everything is the same except this time you own a million AAPL shares.  The stock price still jumps $10.  You've made $10 million bucks.  Can you really be upset about the $100 premium you're paying on the 10 shares you still wish to buy?  Of course not.  You're a net holder and the stock price went up.

But where's the fine line?  Well it's very simple.  If you wish to more than double your stake, then price increases are bad.  If not, then they're good.

Let's now use a realistic example to help prove that last point.  AAPL is still trading at $130.  You still believe it's buyable up until $150.  Except this time you own 75 shares and you'd wish to buy 75 more. The price jumps $10 to $140.  Is this good or bad?

$130 * 75 shares  = $9750

$140 * 75 shares - $750 profit = $9750

It's neutral.  Either way.  Whether the stock price went up or down, doubling your stake was always going to cost you $9750.  

So here's the system of equations if you'd like to geek out and punch it into your graphing calculator:

y = 130x

y = 140x - 750

A few preemptive disclaimers.  Yes I used the word 'profit' instead of 'unrealized gain.'  Sometimes technical correctness has to be forsaken for clarity.  For another, I'm prescribing to the simplistic view that a bird in the hand is better than two in the bush.  When in reality, probability plays a factor.  But, I'm ignoring the wonderful world of probability in this post.  If you would like to explore it in the comments, please feel free.  Perhaps I'll join you.

What do you think of the idea of buying a dividend paying stock that pays out for each day of the month (if that's possible). Say for example you could have Company A pays out on the first for its monthly dividend, Company B pays out on the second of the month, and so and so on. Each day of each month you would receive a check for the dividends that get paid out. You could have a mix of well established companies that pay low dividends with companies that pay higher dividends (but more risk). 

Is this idea stupid or smart? I imagine someone has tried this or the idea has been out there. 

Here's an example of what I would do, if I decided to try this:
First save up $1,000 before I bought my first monthly dividend paying shares. Use my favorite broker (in this example I will use share builder) buy the $1,000 worth of shares plus the initial $9 brokerage fee. Repeat with the next stock on my list when I have $1,000 again that pays out on the next day. Say you buy 28 days worth, $28,000 + brokerage fees. Then you could reinvest the money each month until you get to a point where you would feel comfortable getting a check from the dividends. 

Adjusting this for a bigger scale, do you think this would be a good or bad idea. Please discuss.

15-02-23,2wun1t,TastyTraders share your experience and performance,"I found what Tom Sosnoff talks about in TastyTrade shows very rational. That's why I decided to give their strategy a try on my ~$25K margin account. I decided to dedicate a year starting from January 2014 to learn about their strategy. Because of low VIX and my lack of experience, I ended up losing money(~30% including commission fees) in 2014. However, I learned a lot of lessons such as staying small, not using all of my buying power, and most importantly being careful of trading correlated underlyings which is a very hard task. 

I've decided to carefully apply all the lessons that I learned from 2014 in my 2015 trades. However even though VIX was high for the first 6 weeks of the year, my net liq is down by 6% YTD, excluding commissions. 

My IC strategies underperformed their expected rate of success at 42%(7 out of 17). I believe the average expected rate of success for all those trades is somewhere around 55%.

I have had 7 strangles of those 3 were winners, 1 was loser and 3 ongoing(with unrealized loss).  

I've opened 20 vertical spreads which were mostly for defending my losing IIC positions. I've had 9 small winners, 2 losers and 9 ongoing trades(mostly on unrealized loss). 

TastyTrade market measures studies show that in high IVR periods, selling premium should outperform the expected success rate approximately by 10%. However, based on my own experience/performance this number isn't accurate, which part of that could be because of my limited number of occurrences. 

I'd love to hear from people who have had enough occurrences to see if their success rate matches with TastyTrade market measure studies.",2

What I wonder is how many of the investment world's ideas and practices would have changed if the US had the same results as Japan did in the 25 years since its peak. Would passive-style index  investment still be in vogue? Would buy-the-dip mentality be discredited? How would asset allocation strategies be created when heavy stock portfolios would often be hammered year after year?

15-02-22,2wsixj,[Canadian Financials Earnings] My opinions and experiences on losses being built into the stock prices.,"I have been closely following MFC, BNS, RY, TD, NI, NA etc..

I'm a newb in all this but I've done some research and reading. So I'd really like to know your opinions and rebuttals. Financials are very hard to gauge.



From cold calling, calling IR, and talking with employees a little higher up in MFC, looking at previous earnings misses etc. I've gathered that they tend to write off their losses into the future, into their early quarter losses. So if they expect a loss in Q2 2015 they'll dump all of it into Q1.

As a result when they miss earnings, we see a dip lasting for maybe an hour and a huge rally as institutional players buy more shares (dark pool or not). You can actually a check this out for yourself on the toronto listing for MFC.
I made a handsome amount on Mar 22 C.

But this type of reporting and market response isn't true for players which are scattered WELL out of Canada: TD, RY to name two. I think that we will see RY trade at 74 and less into Friday due to substantial and surprising losses and agency costs of closing operations NOT being built into the price for the past quarter. Currently, people are selling to trim their position and will be rebuying after earnings miss.

also: having kept a record of their prop trading losses in high volatility and modelling it out to the recent times I am almost 90% sure they were timid to be bullish in the recent rally after October's 49$ mm losses in 10 days. In fact, I would not be surprised if the traders were bearish multiple times during the current rally in anticipation of a correction, per their devastating October experience. I believe that their trading earnings will come in well below expectations.

Except for BNS which is well hedged, I fully expect RY, TD, and NA to tank this week into Friday. I am planning to buy the 64 BNS calls into Jul either this week or Monday next week. I currently hold some 76 puts up 40% (bought@1.40) into March for RY. I will be selling these within the day after earnings (not prepared to risk a huge institutional buy).",4

15-02-22,2wsmmd,Trade Update: Ocwen (OCN),"It's usually pretty boring here on the weekend so let me post about a position that I had that closed out yesterday.

It was in Ocwen, $OCN, a mortgage servicer that has had some trouble over the last few months due to regulatory snafus and short selling hedge funds.  

I [bought a bunch of shares](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/2tvf0u/long_25k_ocn_670/co2o4qk) about a month ago, [wrote Feb 20 OTM covered calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/2v17py/ocn_crazy_ride_thoughts/codondk) against it a week later, and as they ended up well into the money by Friday all my shares got assigned.

Here's how everything went down:

[Trade Summary](http://i.imgur.com/ibkvHk8.png)

Total debits were $30,382; total credits $38,700; for a net of +$8,318, or 27.3% profit in a month.  

That could've been a lot better had I not written those calls, as the thing's now trading at 9.60, but I didn't think the shares were going to rebound so quickly.  (The market had its suspicions, though; when I sold those calls they were trading with an IV of 180%, if I remember correctly.)

15-02-22,2wsmmx,Various Target Retirement Fund Questions,"How is the price determined, and what happens when investors start cashing out?


If a lot of people invest in the same fund does that cause the price to be inflated compared to other funds of the same index? For instance Vanguard target funds are really popular options right now, but if many people invest in one of their target funds, would it make the price of a similar fund managed by a different company to be a better alternative?


When people start liquidating their investments, does the price drop - if so is it ideal to be first out? And in that case, what would prevent investors from getting out of a fund nearing its target date and reinvesting into one farther away?


I hope these questions aren't too dumb.",18

15-02-23,2wuw5k,A European with only EUR investments - big mistake?,"I don’t live in the US, but in the much smaller Kingdom of Belgium, which influences and limits my investment decisions.

My personal investments (not linked to e.g. corporate retirement funds where I unfortunately have no say) are rebalanced over 2 funds:

61.8% in iShares Core Euro Corporate Bond - TER 0.20% - no capital gains tax - 25% tax on dividends - 0.09% tax on buying/selling

38.2% in iShares EURO STOXX 50 - TER 0.35% - no capital gains tax - 25% tax on dividends - 0.09% tax on buying/selling


Restricting a significant allocation of my investments to the small and non-diversified Belgian stock-market never sounded quite right. Instead I consider the countries that have EUR as their currency as my hybrid domestic (100% EUR investments) &amp; international (various globally operating companies) stock investments. The Euro Stoxx 50 index was easily available for this and at low-cost. 


I have always struggled though with the fact that I am not invested in some US companies. I never made the jump because of my fear of currency risk. The S&amp;P 500 is filled with remarkable companies, but only handful truly make me regret not being invested in them. There are great pharmaceutical companies in the S&amp;P 500, but so are there in the Euro Stoxx 50, likewise for financial, insurance, and so many other sectors. US companies such as Exxon, Johnson &amp; Johnson and General Electric may outperform European equivalents such as Total, Sanofi and Siemens, but all in all I expect their returns to be similar because of the truly global trade mechanisms.

Some US companies are however truly unique in the world:

Coca-Cola has no equal in Europe

credit card companies such as American Express, MasterCard, Visa have no equal in Europe

IT companies such as Apple, Cisco, HP, IBM and Microsoft have no equal in Europe



Is it worth taking currency risk USD-EUR just in order to be exposed (e.g. through an S&amp;P 500 fund) to these truly amazing US companies without a comparable European equivalent?",7

It was good to me until 2 weeks ago. It shot down on 2/11 after hitting a high of 7.58 and I had a bad hunch (I know, not very empirical) and sold at 7.00. I always planned to sell before their earnings announcement (2/24) and re-buy after. Their earnings should be low so I hope the stock will go down a bit. So now I'm just waiting for the right time to get back in. 
Some info about MNKD:
They just released their long-awaited drug Afrezza, a fast acting insulin that is inhaled. They have a marketing partnership with sanofi. I expect Afrezza to not be profitable till late 2016-17. The last inhalable insulin was by Merck (I believe) and failed miserably.

Liquidmetal is trading at only $0.16, up 16% today, with a ~$66m market cap.  They lost $14m last year on $1m of revenue. Stock has been beaten down over the past few years and is trading near its 52 wk low, $0.10. 

Is there an investment opportunity here over the next 5-10 years? If Apple's project ends up being, or even looks to be, a serious entry into the electric car market, $LQMT stock should benefit greatly just by the exposure of the relationship and by revenues associated with the partnership.

1.  Gasoline options expire tomorrow and historically short sellers grabbing profits at the last minute have driven up the price of oil.(short squeeze)

2.  The north east winter storm shut down refineries for a few days and the first nationwide oil refinery strike in more than 30 years expanded this weekend in a labor dispute that may start having more of an impact.

3.  Oil has traded down the 5 past trading days.  From a high of $54.92 last Tuesday, to today's close of $49.38.

4.  OPEC is in the news and traders are scared... Just the mention of OPEC today drove up the price for a short time.  

5.  Although last weeks rig count did drive down prices initially due to a slow in the decrease of Idle rigs...  The fact remains Oil explorers idled rigs for the 11th straight week, reducing them by 37 to 1019 and traders are keeping a close eye it.  


Please don't confuse my short-term bet tomorrow with my opinion on whether the price of oil is rebounding or not.  I have no clue if oil goes to $65, or dips to $25, I just feel oil is over due for a short term correction.

15-02-24,2wxjzw,Investing in high-dividend ETFs,"Hi all!

I am about to start investing in the near future and I was wondering what everyone thinks about an idea I have. 

I want to invest in ETFs that pay high dividends and continue to reinvest those dividends into those ETFs. My idea is that I continue doing this for a while along with adding more money to the brokerage account and then eventually, when I am much older, I can use those dividends as a ""salary."" Also, what are some good high dividend ETFs I can look into?

Any ideas/thoughts?

15-02-24,2wxxwq,Chart that demonstrates relationship between savings rate and years until retirement,"http://i.imgur.com/8dtHXgR.png

To read this, find your savings rate (% of income saved toward retirement) and an approximate rate of return (6%, 8%, and 10% are all reasonable assumptions). The corresponding box shows how many years until you can retire.

This chart demonstrates how a higher savings rate can drastically reduce your time to retire because you are not only saving more, but getting used to living on less. Note how going from a 5% savings rate to a 15% savings rate will allow you to quit working a good 15 years sooner.

Keep in mind the 4% rule is based on backtesting that showed you would not outlive your money over the course of 30 years with a 60% stock 40% bond portfolio in 95% of all historical starting points going back about 100 years if you withdraw 4% of your portfolio in the first year of retirement and continue to withdraw this dollar amount adjusted for inflation in subsequent years.

What I'm wondering is first, what's the deal with this offering? They've had a bad quarter, does this play into their dropping stock price? And what's more, is Sprint a decent value investment (or could the become one if they continue to dive)? They supply a cruddy product at a cheap price, every market needs a company like that.

15-02-24,2x19yd,I used to be an investment consultant and just finished reading Tony Robbins new book. Here are the top 5 things I learned.,"Hi Reddit! I just finished reading Tony Robbins new book, Money: Master The Game. 

I used to be a financial and investment adviser in the UK and have read more than one hundred  books about investment and economics. I have passed professional qualifications in financial planning, investment planning and stockbroking and I used to have a personal finance column in a newspaper and despite this, I still learned some things while reading the book. So I’d like to pass some of these lessons on.

Firstly, Ray Dalio’s All Weather Portfolio gets a lot of attention. Robbins mentioned the portfolio a lot during his press interviews, so it isn’t a secret. The idea behind it is that by investing in different types of asset you will have different holdings designed for different stages in the economic cycle. To get a good description, honestly, you should read the book. If you are a long-term investor this is very interesting. 

Back in the 1970s Harry Browne described his Permanent Portfolio, which is a slightly simpler way to achieve the same thing. I’m sure the concept was the basis for the All Weather Portfolio. The Permanent Portfolio has a great record in the last 40 years, but the All Weather Portfolio is a step up in thinking and results.

What is most interesting about it is the ability of the portfolio to protect the downside. You can hear Tony Robbins discuss the portfolio [here](http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000330321#.).

Secondly, as I just mentioned is protecting the downside. I have had notions of this for a long time, but it has never been so well explained as here. The idea is simply that the big time hedge fund managers put in a lot of time to research their potential positions and look for small risk / big upside positions. These are known as asymmetric trades. 

It has always seemed to me that too many investors (myself included in the early days) view the stock market as being the same as a trip to the casino. “Its good fun and if I only take $100 I can only lose $100”. It is a kind of holiday camp mentality. Lots of people go into a casino not to win or lose but to spend money for fun. I can think of lots of private investors (and some former clients) that had this approach. 

In contrast, the hedge fund managers interviewed in the book are paranoid about the downside and being able to exit trades intact. That was really eye opening to me. 

Thirdly, the use of index funds. Index funds have a pretty decent press and are quite popular, but they are actually the go-to solution for these hedge fund managers. Robbins repeatedly asks people what advice they would give to family and friends about investing and they all suggest index funds in one way or another. Even Warren Buffett told him so!

(Depending upon where you live, the generic type of fund might be called a mutual fund, a unit trust or a Sicav. [This is a good description](http://www.stockexchangesecrets.com/fund-management.html) of how these funds work).

Considering that these guys earn a decent chunk of their money from the fees they take as fund managers, I really was not expecting them to suggest that investors ought to find low cost funds that replicate the market. In the book, a wide range of his experts suggest [Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/home/). 

Fourth, Robbins explains the impact of fees in a way that I had not thought of before. I can only presume that I had been as brainwashed as everyone else by Wall Street, The City of London and financial institutions everywhere to think that the fund management fees were “low” but he explains quite clearly the impact on the overall return to the investor. 

Obviously, its all just math and I feel an idiot for not seeing it this way before, but basically the average annual return on most funds (as received by the investor) will drop by 30% or more once fees are removed. The impact of that over the long-term in a pension fund, for example, is massive, as in $1m is now only worth $0.5-6m, or whatever. I think because we don’t look at the total lifetime impact we view the numbers as small, but they really aren’t. 

I am coming to see this more as the “house edge” that a casino has rather than a fund management fee. I realise that is quite cynical of me, but my perception really has changed. 

Lastly, I came to realise what a lot of crap is published in this space. I don’t know how many basic books about investment and financial planning must be published each year, but it is a lot. The vast majority just rehash the same information over and over to a new audience. I must have read twenty or more books over the years that I learned literally nothing from. This one was different. The way Tony Robbins made it different was by presuming he was not an expert and seeking out and interviewing real experts - not experts that are talking heads on TV but people that have made billions of dollars by investing wisely. 

The book was long. It is about 600 pages, so you need to be committed to read it. However, from here on, when people ask me what to read or do I will recommend this book and none of the others I used to. For a lay person, it is a much more usable guide. I hope someone finds this helpful. 

(I’m no longer an adviser and I’m pretty sure there is no “reddit only” section in financial rules, so these are my thoughts for entertainment purposes only).",0

**GBSN** anticipating a washout. Will trade around how the stock reacts to the 3 mark. Using 3 as a guide. Ideally want to see it washout below 3 and risk on it for the day. Will add to pops on the way down.(indepth: http://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/2wx9ga/keep_an_eye_on_gbsn/)


**BIOC** is another float rotation stock (a lot of these lately). Expecting a morning parabolic to 3 and will use it as a guide to risk thoughout the day. I will add on pops.

**RIGL** gapped up and crapped out. Not a float rotation stock. Lots of volume so a washout below 3 is what I would be looking for here. Ideally I will cover at around the .75 - .50 cent mark

**SGNL** I will buy the bounce if a trend forms because a lot of people would be anticipating a bounce after such a huge runup. Will add onto dips.

15-02-23,2wvyby,My stock picks as a complete newbie.,"Hey guys,  after lurking here a while and doing some research I think I'm ready to make my first trades. I'm going to use $2,000 just to get my feet wet,  and possibly invest more later. I'm sticking with bigger companies I'm familiar and feel safer with to start. Here are a few of my top picks and why. 


AAPL: Obvious reasons. I believe it's a great company, but I am a little skeptical about the watch they are releasing, I don't know how it is going to be perceived by the average Joe. If there is a slump I know Apple can make it up though.


UA: This is a company I believe in. I use their products, and they're only getting more popular. I could see their shoe department cutting into Nike more and more in the next couple of years. Also with them buying MyFitnessPal I believe that shows great forward thinking in the company and they could do a lot with it. 


DIS: This is the one I am the most sad I didn't get on sooner. I love Disney and with the beast they are becoming with buying Marvel and Star Wars there is no telling what they will buy next.

I watched the 'best investing' video shared somewhere here a few days ago and there's a point where the host speaks about a time where Cisco was about 10% of an index and that's a bad thing. It got me thinking, Singapore's Index is STI and it consist of the 40 largest company in singapore. The problem is the top 4 holding weight is 42% and I am not comfortable with this anymore. (source http://www.spdrs.com.sg/etf/fund/fund_detail_STTF.html#[1] )  
My country has a mandatory social security vehicle whereby 20% of my pay is automatically saved into an account yielding 4%/year, and my employer will match 17%. (my income 60k SGD/yr, 12k is deducted from my income, and the employer adds 10.2; so im 'forced' to save 22.2k per year into this account) this forced savings account cannot be touched until im at my retirement age(65yrs old). this is a very simplified version of the social security here.
I see the forced saving of 22.2k as some sort of a bond investment so my personal investment; all 120k of it is currently in STI. Moving forward, i am going to invest about 2k per month.
My costs right now is brokerage fee 0.25% and the fund's expense ratio of 0.3%
I am considering of switching to something along the line of 40% US(Vanguard VTI) 40% International (Vanguard VT) and 20% Local (STI)
The problem is the brokerage give PATHETIC exchange rate, they're pocketing about 1.21%! so i see this as added cost to buying VT and VTI.
Is my thinking right, that in the long run, i am saving money because even with the 1.21%(+another 1.21% when i sell it way into the future) exchange rate spread, my cost is lower because VTI's expense ratio is 0.05%pa where as the index im holding onto now is 0.30%pa?
Also exchange rate risk, is it something i shoud be worried about? i mean, even the local index is subjected to exchange rate risk because the profit is derived from all over the world. so it shouldnt be any different right?

15-02-24,2wyuth,How To Disrupt Investment Newsletter Publishers (Legally),"Brief: Publishers such as Forbes, Agora and Investor’s Daily currently overcharge their customers for hard-to-verify financial advice that would ordinarily be regulated were it not distributed in the form of an investment newsletter. Up until now they have been successful in using various abuses of the system of the press in order to defend themselves against attack from financial regulators, disgruntled customers and competitors, creating an environment among such publishers akin to a monopolist deadlock.

In particular, the First Amendment privileges afforded the North American press combined with the old pre-industrial era British legislation pertaining to copyright infringement has been the perfect antiquated and advanced legislative cocktail that combined, has meant they have been able to aggressively pursue market share without accountability while crushing disruptive competitors who have succeeded in other areas of industry as the economy has become more technologically focused (even in the mainstream press itself!)

In the passages below however, I will show how the system that such publishers have built as both artillery-laden galleons and walls of defence are much more easy to disrupt than most assume. Indeed, by their historic propensity for secrecy and lack of transparency alone, such publishers will soon face a number of dilemmas as copyright infringement cases become obsolete in the era of data analysis that will be able to synthetically reproduce more robust versions of their unreliable publications and sell profitably for what will be a fraction of the price. The following passages discuss how this transition is likely to occur.

Part 1. Investment Newsletter Publishers
Forbes publishes 31 newsletters at an average of $31 per month for a combined $924 per month. Investing Daily, another tip sheet website, publishes 11 newsletters for a total of $585 per month, with huge variations between the averages (some go for as little as $3 per month while the most expensive is charged at $250 per month). Agora Financial, also a major player in the financial newsletter business, has the widest standard deviation between publication prices of all: it varies its prices between $3 per newsletter up to $416 for its house publication … averaged for amounts per month. In total, AF’s newsletters combined cost a little under $2800 per month. To someone in the business of disrupting industry standards, the process of offering these same products – or near enough – for a tenth or less of the price to an audience that is at least ten or twenty times larger seems like too good an opportunity to miss, surely?

While true, there have been a number of legal shenanigans in recent years with regard to the rights of newsletter publishers that have most likely put disruptors off. This post will demonstrate why in very exacting detail disruptors need not be so discouraged, however. In fact, the opportunity is there for many to make a killing by disrupting this information cartel of sorts.
So here’s the question we are going to answer in the following passages:

Is it possible to disrupt these high-priced products with a cheaper version based based on the original newsletters without violating any publishing laws?

Note: we are not talking about putting out simply a cheaper investment newsletter: companies such as TheStreet.com, Motley Fool and WallStCheatSheet have already done that. That is simply competitive activity, when what we are interested in is disruptive activity. Thus, we are hoping to find out here if there is a way to sell a cheaper remake of the higher-priced investment newsletters on the market and advertise them as such without crossing any laws.

Part 1.1 Legal Precedent For Newsletters 
(Agora et al v Salmer, 2010; Barclays et al v TheFlyOnTheWall)
In 2010, Agora Financial led a number of other newsletter publishers in a civil claim against Martin Salmer, the proprietor of TipsTraders.com (Agora et al v Salmer, 2010). (As a matter of fact, a few years before the Agora case was heard, Barclays made a similar attempt to stop another ostensibly early disruptor working in financial news from impairing the value of its proprietary research in Barclays et al. v TheFlyOnTheWall; the case went to the second circuit court in the end and you can read all about it in the link provided as for the latter one too).
At the time, Salmer was copying the recommendations of newsletter publishers and distributing them for free on his website. Agora et al. alleged that such activities violated the “hot news” precedent (whereby certain forms of news such as sports scores are protected in specific incidences from being transcribed by anyone other than the broadcaster). However, Agora et al. also alleged that the tipsters’ comments were copyrighted, since they were not facts but opinions, leading to the confusing implicit denial of their hot news claim (hot news must be factual – i.e. uncopyrighted material since it is just “news”). As a result, the court found the defendant not in violation of the hot news rule and hence innocent of accused charges (even though he was technically in violation of the plaintiff’s copyright this was not the case being brought before the courts. One cannot help but feel this was a deliberate ploy of Agora’s attorneys, but it’s one that might back fire, as I shall show …)

Anyway, what became clear from the court’s findings in the Agora et al v Salmer case was specifically that:

1. Copying the specific investment recommendations in tip-sheets written by analysts and posting elsewhere does not violate any special news privileges as protected by US law

2. Copying the specific investment recommendations in tip-sheets written by analysts and posting elsewhere does violate copyright law

3. Copying the language specifically describing the investment recommendations as written verbatim in tip-sheets and posting elsewhere does violate copyright law

These last two points might appear at first to legally obstruct any possibility of disrupting high-priced newsletters, but in fact that is not the case. This is because the option to form one’s own opinion of the stock markets as a result of reading the tip-sheets first is still very much open to the disruptor. For as long as neither the language of the newsletter is copied verbatim nor the specific recommendations prescribed within them are copied and reposted, there is nothing to stop a disruptor forming independent investment ideas very similar – almost identical, in fact – to those featured in the newsletters or pointing to categories of stocks wherein the investment recommendations occur and advising investors to focus their attention on such an area and/or niche.
Thus, if a disruptor bases his investment recommendations on the broad advice offered by various tip sheet authors/analysts and advises to his customers that investment advice offered within the newsletter he is selling is inspired by/based on ideas generated by a broad cross-section of newsletters, but is equally careful to caution that this advice is not the same specific advice as found in the branded newsletters that is OK. As long as the disruptor’s investment recommendations fundamentally differ in terms of offering alternate specific stock selection recommendations to the ones in the original tipsheet, then the disruptive publisher is neither in violation of hot news precedents nor copyright violations.

Part 1.2 Markets Reports (Hypothetical)
So let’s put together 3 hypothetical newsletters now …

Forbes Inspired Report: This Report will gather information and data from a range of 31 reports issued by Forbes weekly/monthly, compile such data and investment intuition, and arrive at an independent investment decision-making process based on the advice offered but not repeating any specific investment recommendations.

Investors Daily Inspired Report: This Report will gather information and data from a range of 11 reports issued by Investors Daily weekly/monthly, compile such data and investment intuition, and arrive at an independent investment decision-making process based on the advice offered but not repeating any specific investment recommendations.

Agora Financial Inspired Report: This Report will gather information and data from a range of 18 reports issued by Agora Financial weekly/monthly, compile such data and investment intuition, and arrive at an independent investment decision-making process based on the advice offered but not repeating any specific investment recommendations.

These (hypothetical) report prices and their comparative price benefits to consumers compared with the (real) prices charged by the brand-name publishers for the originals are detailed below (accurate as of day of publication):

Part 2. Sales Pitch/Marketing &amp; Promotion
The logical question might be: if these newsletters are not going to offer the same investment recommendations or reprint the same content as that which is in the branded newsletters, then who would be interested to purchase them?

Believe it or not, a whole lot of people! For this type of question is a classic one that is asked of early disruptors time after time, and in fact you can find it in myriad forms:

1. Who would download a potentially virus-prone song on the internet, let alone pay for an MP3 version of the song, when you can buy a better-quality version of the song on compact disk from the music store down the road?

2. Who would watch a whole movie on a laptop with a noticeably impaired visual quality when it is possible to “burn” the file onto a DVD and insert it in a DVD player and watch the same movie on a wide screen TV?

3. Who would purchase a watch that was not a Rolex, but instead was one designed to look just like a Rolex in most outwardly superficial respects, or who would purchase a car that was not an Audi, but was designed to look superficially similar to an Audi from a distance?

Disruption happens when a technology that has implied scale-bound leverage is utilized to offer an ultimately (empirically speaking) lower-quality product to a market that cannot afford or does not feel comfortable paying the price for a competing product with a 100% authentic quality guarantee. For the customer, the disruptor’s product offering is a chance to get as close to the real thing as he/she possibly can without having to fork out the huge sums of money or go to the inconvenience of purchasing that genuine artifact.

There is no reason to doubt that a very high-quality business and financial news publication offered for free to customers and which has full utilization of Google News headline and stock ticker presence, would not succeed by offering a range of newsletters priced at a fraction of the cost of the sum of the major branded investment tipsheets combined.
For it is clear that demand is so high for such tip sheets that some investors are willing to pay up to $2500 a year or more to subscribe to them; thus for a small portion of that totalling $100 a year or so, it is highly likely that a market exists for substitute products which are not as detailed or methodical in terms of the analysis and advice that is offered but which claim to have the same focus exactly as the branded versions do.

It is worth noting that it would be impossible to charge the publisher of the disruptive newsletter in this event with any form of copyright infringement or false advertisement, since the disclaimer would be made upfront that the information within the high-priced and low-cost reports fundamentally differed, and that purely inspiration was drawn: in this case, the precedent that a court finding for copyright infringement would make is too ridiculous to imagine. Publishers everywhere would be guilty of printing authors’ passages when they were thematically “inspired” by passages of their peers.

Part 3. Solving Copyright Breach &amp; The Quality Gap
The most disruptive applications of inspiration tend to come from technologies acting in artificially quantitative and more broadly, analytical, ways. Thus, the process of analysis that each newsletter contains might look similar to the following:

1 .Data from original newsletters is entered numerically into a spreadsheet.

2. Data is analyzed for standard metrics such as revenue, earnings, earnings growth, number of employees, length of investment etc.

3. Fresh data from various areas of the stock market is then entered alongside this recently-analyzed data and the two results are compared qualitatively for similarity of operations and quantitatively for the lowest standard deviation (with a cut off variation mean ensuring that stray data is not included in the end result).

4. The resultant investment recommendations, being composed of individual investment recommendations, broader sector recommendations and observations about management teams in general is transcribed into a new newsletter that is distributed to purchasers.

5. Three different products are distributed (see picture on link at bottom): the individual reports, which are priced at around 12% of their retail price at the branded level, a Pro product, which consists of some extra free reports along with reduced-priced versions of the Forbes and ID Derived reports, and a Fund Manager’s product, which includes further discounts and in addition to a heavily-discounted (&gt;90%) Agora Financial Derived Report.

Part 4. Conclusion
From the discussion and the examples given herein it is clear that the inspiration advertised is in fact a perfectly easy-to-illustrate guideline describing a specific quantitative process and not a copyright infringement as defined in Agora et al v Salmer.

The resultant authenticity of the advertising message for the derived newsletter is also ironically made more plausible and coherent in the advertising method when it is explained in detail.

Specifically, it is immediately ascertainable that the investment recommendations being made in the brand-derived publication is in some way tied to its predecessor but in such a way that it cannot be accused of infringing on any brand’s patent authenticity nor of legally abridging its publisher’s rights of authorship and publication.

Finally, it is clear from the extent of the price point of the branded publication that substantial scale might be achieved offering a lower-quality remake in the form of the brand-derived publication.

15-02-24,2wyxnk,Real Estate Investments: Comparing London to New York,"Two of the biggest cities on the globe have always been struggling to one-up one another, even if they are not doing so intentionally. London was a global hub first but New York City has quickly met and surpassed the home of Buckingham Palace, the Eye, and Big Ben. Still even as both cities compete on distinct stages for the title of most recognized city in the world there are some things which really unite rather than divide them. One of these is the real estate in both places; the demand and the costs have stayed right up there. But which is the better spot for real estate investing for you?


New York

Real Estate Investments: Comparing London to New York: Prices

New York City has kind of always been the place for real estate investing. The thing about New York City which sort of sets it apart from anywhere else is that the space is finite. Urban areas that are on the mainland can just sort of keep sprawling outward like Los Angeles. But London has really always maintained a good senses of local identity. That has worked in its favor for keeping the home prices in London not just strong but competitively so. Knightsbridge and Mayfair are both areas in London where the home prices continue to be hot. Prices rose last year in those 2 neighborhoods a purported 7.5%. New York City home prices have continued to rise commensurate with rates like those in London.

 

Real Estate Investments: Comparing London to New York: Deeper

One thing that makes London such a strong place for investing in real estate is that things never get as bad as they are rumored to one day be. Still London is interested in levying some pretty strong taxes which many homeowners and luxury residence dwellers will find pretty alarming. Local government is looking to increase capital gains taxes up some 18-28%. That is a lot for the very wealthy who are looking to make London their home. Still New York has remained competitive in the fact that there is a fairly low tax when compared with London housing.


 
 

Real Estate Investments: Comparing London to New York: Buildings

Many of the buildings in both London and New York are on the older side of things. But London’s buildings are increasingly stodgier than many of the buildings in New York City. The thing about New York buildings is that so many of them are constantly being renovated and re-updated to fit with the then modern temperament. Of course it’s not really fair to say that London, a city whose history dates back more than 2000 years, has an older infrastructure than New York whose history only goes back a couple of hundred years, at least in its current formation it could be argued that New York City wasn’t really the city it is today until 1811 when the grid plans were drawn up.

 

Real Estate Investments: Comparing London to New York: Needs

At the end of the day it really comes down to the individual needs of the purchaser. New York and London are both commercial and financial epicenters; but where are you doing most of your business? Where do you want your future to be? Where will you see yourself finding your greatest success? Once you answer those questions then you can begin to decide which city would be a better investment for your real estate dollar.

New York City and London are both capital cities in every way. Both offer much and your local broker at Prestige International can help you find your way.

**BIOC #1 Watch**:  is another float rotation stock, **very very tricky**. Only shorting parabolic moves to whole/half dollar marks. **I will at no point be shorting the ""back side of move""**. Expecting a parabolic past 4 to the 4 - .50 range. Will add to pops.

**HMNY** is a likely a pump and dump. With only 357.02K Float and 84.66% held by insiders, I think it is pretty safe to say that this could run up a lot. I will be using 3.50 as a guide throughout the day. 

**VPCO** is a vaper company. I thought this stock was worth like .30 cents but whatever. Expecting one of 2 things to happen. Ideally stock parabolics past 1.50 and I will begin to short at any sign of weakness (likely around the .70 - 90 level). Where I will add to pops. Or the stock will washout and I will ignore it.

**APRI** has a very clean trend. Ideally it will parabolic move past 2.5, which it likely holding up around the .60-.70 range. Will be shorting the back side of move on this stock if the opportunity presents itself.

**CHGG** is up on so much good news. Good earning and after a news report that said (morning market trading Tuesday after the company said that Ingram Content Group will be taking over the textbook rental business as of May 1). Thought I would throw this on here incase anyone had any plans of longterm buying.

I'm 25 years old and going to use $2,000 just to get my feet wet, and possibly invest more later. I'm sticking with bigger companies I'm familiar and feel safer with to start. Here are a few of my top picks and why.

AAPL: Obvious reasons. I believe it's a great company, but I am a little skeptical about the watch they are releasing, I don't know how it is going to be perceived by the average Joe. If there is a slump I know Apple can make it up though.

UA: This is a company I believe in. I use their products, and they're only getting more popular. I could see their shoe department cutting into Nike more and more in the next couple of years. Also with them buying MyFitnessPal I believe that shows great forward thinking in the company and they could do a lot with it.

DIS: This is the one I am the most sad I didn't get on sooner. I love Disney and with the beast they are becoming with buying Marvel and Star Wars there is no telling what they will buy next. All of that said, I honestly don't know if right now is the best time to buy DIS. They had a $10 price jump a few weeks ago, and then leveled off. I would like for them to dip back down a little lower before I buy.

I feel like these are pretty well diversified and solid companies. What's your opinion on buying Disney now, or should I wait until it drops some (if it ever does). I hope this is enough info and thanks everyone!",29

15-02-24,2wzcq6,Sliding allocation,"I was tossing the idea around in my head the other day. Basically, you would want 100% stocks after a crash, and 100% bonds right before. You can't know when the peaks will happen, though the valleys are easier to spot even if you can't know when the bottom is.  
So I was thinking, after a crash, set your stock/bond split to 100/0, and then progressively move towards 0/100. The goal is to lock in your gains through each cycle by attempting to approximate market timing with less of the gambling aspect.  
Here are some key observations and questions:  
* if the bull run is long, moving too quickly to bonds will hurt your return  
* if the bull run is short, not moving to hickey enough will hurt your return  
* this could be better or worse than keeping the same allocation and rebalancing  

Questions:  
* how can one slide their split quickly enough but not too quickly (perhaps have an overall do not cross line of say 50/50?).  
* will such a strategy beat the constant with rebalancing?

The best way to explain what is going on behind the scenes is that instead of rebalancing, you would actively commit more money to whichever side is currently losing, thus always buying low and selling high.

Originally, the idea was to rebalance every 6 months 5% towards the losing side, except when a crash happened in which case, revert to 100/0.

EDIT: [Graphs](http://imgur.com/VgKrnLJ) comparing this method to 80/20 starting in 1986 (as far back as I could get reliable bond index pricing). Both start with 10k and both start at 80/20 allocation. Indexes used: S&amp;P500 for stocks and VBMFX for bonds. Rebalancing 5% either way unless the value in index has changed negatively by 20% or more, in which case, 100/0.",2

While these statements can apply to more to just finances, the chances are that you understand that it is a bad idea to invest all your cash in one stock, or put all your money into the same property - but have you really thought about a long term strategy?
Current bank interest rates can only be described as shocking. I read an article at work today that discussed how an Aberdeen Assets fund manager has stated that the safest place for savers to put their money is in shares. While this might seem like an outrageous statement to most, he makes a good point; investing money in a savings account is a pretty bad idea. Given the current rates of inflation versus the interest rates… you are guaranteed to lose money.

What is Forex Trading?
Forex Trading is something we have all probably heard about at some point – perhaps through an advert in the Financial Times or a money magazine of some sort; but do you actually know what it means? Forex trading is the trading of foreign currency (hence the name foreign exchange). Essentially, you buy one currency with another – the idea being using the fluctuating currency conversion rates to your advantage.

Success Story – The Accidental Pay Day
I have a great personal example of how you can make some serious money on the Forex markets. My uncle and his family live in the US after he emigrated over 20 years ago. After leaving the UK, he sold his property and left a large sum of money in a UK bank account. He owns a project management type business and a few years back had to transfer a large sum of money as collateral for an insurance bond – essentially he had to use the nest egg as a guarantee against the insurance policy for a job. He transferred the money from GBP (British Pounds Sterling) to USD (US Dollar) at a rate of approximately $2 for every £1. £80,000 of savings became equivalent to $160,000.
Now he kept this money in the bond to guarantee the insurance for about nine months and transferred the cash back to his UK account shortly after. He thought nothing of this for about a year, until he received his annual interest statement for the UK bank account. Can you imagine the shock (and delight) upon finding out that £80,000 was now over £100,000!? Now I can assure you that the bank didn’t decide to pay him 25% interest, but instead the foreign exchange markets had changed significantly: £1 to $2 had become £1 to $1.50. A case of trading the money at the right time – Had it been the other way around, he would have made a significant loss!
 
Who is Forex Trading For?
The simple answer is everyone! Anyone is able to trade in foreign exchange, but those who have interests and investments in multiple countries had a slight advantage as they can trade between bank accounts. For example, if I have investments in the US (or at least in dollars) and in the UK, I could benefit from having assets in both currencies and move funds when the markets are advantageous to your positions, but there can be significant fees associated with this technique. Others will use Forex trading platforms to convert money between different currencies with the intent purely to make money – i.e. there is no practical reason (like to invest in a property) for converting from one currency to the other.
 
Like anything else, Forex Trading has a level of risk associated with it. There are many resources online where you can learn about the principles of Forex and trading within the market. I highly recommend that you do some reading and research before jumping in – You can lose money as well as gain through trading currencies. That said, if you are totally risk adverse, maybe the low-interest savings accounts are a better option. You have to be prepared to lose some (if not all) of your investment or play. Similar to the stocks and shares, some currencies are more stable than others – politically unstable currencies are far more likely to fluctuate than the US dollar.

What I already know (if I am recalling my facts correctly):

- BRK.A is really, really expensive compared to BRK.B.

- Warren Buffet hasn't split BRK.A because he doesn't like speculation and he doesn't like overvaluation.  The high price prevents traders from buying and selling willy nilly.

- Buffet believes that serious investors should put a serious portion of their wealth into companies they believe in.  Which is another reason why he keeps BRK.A's price so high.

- Buffet allowed the creation of BRK.B so shareholders could gift shares of Berkshire and so smaller guys can have a piece of the company.

- BRK-A has voting rights.  BRK.B does not.

So, why doesn't everyone - even super rich guys - buy BRK.B?  Are they attracted to the bragging rights or status of BRK.A?  Or do they really want to vote?  Or is there some other reason I am missing?

They missed earnings by a cent and met revenue expectation. Outlook seemed very postive. Not good enough to  bump the stock price up, but not bad enough to warrant a freaking 20% drop. 

Did my research before. Site traffic increased (looked at alexa, google trends, etc.), true car was starting to get its name out more (True car ads more prevalent), car sales have increased in Q4 2014 (ford, gm, etc. all beat their earnings) meaning more relevance of the site.

Trying to figure out the best way to invest in the long haul I started watching youtube videos on stock trade and selling and buying and got enough info to create an etrade account. I only put a couple hundred bucks in it, and I have been doing decent, not making millions, but not losing everything at the same time. I continue to slowly add more money. I am 30 now and do what a lot of people probably do at my age and hit my head and wonder why I didn't start this earlier. Their has been a lot of debate on why schools don't offer financial advise and I have heard all sort of reasons and theories. Just curious why so many people are scared to invest or don't take the time to watch a few hours of youtube videos or read a few books and play in the market. The way the job market is these days, it seems like playing in the stock market is just a secure as a 9-5. I have been with 3 companies that have pulled the rug out from under me for budget reasons or the company was closing. I have heard that the big people on wall street don't want others to invest to keep the money to themselves, but it seems like the more people that invest, the better. ",20

3. What ETFs should I invest in subsequently (monthly)?

Their system was unable to handle this situation and my money simply disappeared from my account. The statement showed the purchase correctly but a redemption of zero.

This same type of error occurred on other people's accounts I checked. The dollars involved were anywhere from several hundred to many thousands of dollars. Some of the errors had been on the books for several months.

The firm did correct all the errors of course. But I wonder if they did it across the board or only for those that reported.

This month it's different. Analysts expected a ~40% YoY drop, but their recent checks from the last week (the week of the Chinese New Year holiday) are trending towards a ~50-55% drop. 

Macau stocks have been rallying all of February for no damn reason. All 4 major players in Macau (lvs, wynn, mgm, mpel) missed Q4 earnings over the past few weeks and provided mediocre outlooks at best (except for MGM, which was legitimately positive) - yet all of them rallied. 

The last couple of days it looks like the bubble has burst. Monday started with a cautious note from CS on a potential worse-than-expected decline. Tuesday we had news that China was looking to limit Mainland tourism into Macau. Going into Wednesday, we're getting notes from 4 other analysts (GS, UBS, WF, and Nomura) confirming CS' notes from Monday, quantifying it as a 50-55% drop YoY.

15-02-25,2x2uaw,"GOOG is History's Most Complicated Tulip Bubble.","There are two ways for a share to derive end user utility.  Through dividends and through being owned in a large enough quantity to actually affect ownership of the company.  Well what about non-voting GOOG Class - C shares?  You could own all the Class - C shares you want, and you'd still never own the company.  So that leaves dividends.  But GOOG doesn't pay a dividend.  But in the future it might.

But, for argument's sake, let's say that GOOG will never pay a dividend.  Or if that is too far fetched, then let's say Google releases a new Class - D share.  A, B, and C will pay a dividend, but D's are absolutely, 100%, set in stone, never going to pay a dividend.

Are Class - D shares worth anything?

Well of course.  But how?  They don't have any end user utility.  

Welcome to modern finance.  Either does a dollar bill.  There's a great scene in the Walking Dead where Daryl comes across a large bundle of money in a country club.  He takes the money and burns it.  Not only did the scene serve as a great character moment where we learn how resentful Daryl is for growing up in poverty, but it's also a wonderful social commentary.  With society collapsed, the only purpose money serves is to be burned.  Which is ironic.  Because money always burned.  It didn't have to be harvested, and inked, and printed out, and distributed thru a monetary policy by a central bank, to be traded back and forth for decades in various economic systems.  It could have just as easily been burnt as wood or crop.  Ash to ash.  Dust to dust.  But I digress.

Money's only value is fiduciary.  It's worth something because you can trade it for something else, and that something else will provide you with end utility.  Like a blow job or whatever.

So what does this have to do with stocks?  Well, stocks are essentially private currencies.  Just like money is backed by the full faith of the U.S. government, stocks are backed by the full faith of the corporation.  And just like the US government, corporations can inflate or deflate the supply.  And a currency's purchasing power is determined by the strength of it's underlying economy.  In case of a business, the underlying economics of the business. 
 
But the analogy does have limits.  A dollar can buy part of the economy by which it is backed.  But the Class - C can never do that.  Not that people seem to care.  There's a $2 difference between Class - A and Class - C shares.  Which is fitting, because they all essentially have zero voting rights because the founders own the Class - B shares. 

The Class - C's only value is that some day, Google may offer a dividend.  (And Class - A has the additional value that some day, the founders will give up their 56% voting stake, and Class - A's one vote will matter again.)

But I doubt anyone is actually valuing Class - A and Class - C shares based on future dividend and ownership possibilities.  They're being traded on the greater fool theory.  That they can sell it for more than they paid for it.  And I doubt that Class - D shares would trail Class - C shares by any meaningful amount.

So it's kind of funny.  Centuries after the tulip bubble, we're up to the same old tricks.  Except this time we're not even trading something as tangible as a tulip.  We're trading numbers that exist in electricity and magnetism.  Mankind's evolution is astounding.

15-02-25,2x2vco,Thoughts on Inovio Pharmaceuticals (INO)?,"https://www.google.com/finance?cid=662976

First off, i think their DNA vaccine technology is genius. They have a huge advantage over traditional vaccines - they can provide 100% safe vaccines for deadly viruses and diseases like Ebola (their animal trials of the Ebola vaccine were 100% effective at preventing the disease). They can provide broad sense resistance to multiple strains of a disease better than a traditional vaccine. Their vaccines are much cheaper to produce and more adaptable in an emergency than normal vaccines. Since it isn't delivered into a blood vein, it might require less training to deliver one of these vaccines (not sure on this) which would mean their vaccines could be brought to a much larger amount of people in Africa and Asia than otherwise. Huge potential in my eyes to fight infectious disease around the world.

Their clinical trials have shown that their electroporation technique is both safe and effective at delivering an immune response. They have completed stage 1 trials with their HPV vaccine successfully -- since for each vaccine the technology is essentially the same, they are all basically guaranteed to get through stage 1 trials. That's 7+ catalysts within the next few years. The only ones that give me pause are some of their cancer vaccines, if they are not specific enough it could produce an immune response against healthy cells which would be pretty bad. Their cancer vaccines would be groundbreaking if they work, although they have a limited scope for potential targets. 

Also, they discontinued their HIV-B vaccine after getting through stage 1. My analysis of this is that the treatment was safe, leading to its approval for this stage, but that the vaccine was not effective at preventing HIV-B. I assume it was unsuccessful and not a lack of funding because their HIV-C vaccine is still in production, which is the form of the disease most common in Asia and Africa - places where people won't be paying as much for vaccines (although personally I would rather see a vaccine help developing nations). This could translate to a problem with their vaccines for all rapidly evolving viruses, meaning that even with broad sense vaccines they would have no edge over the other efforts to produce vaccines for these viral envelopes. 

Still, their HPV vaccine looks very promising and if it gets approval, the revenue will allow them to start ramping up R&amp;D a lot. Broad sense flu vaccine, for instance, is currently unfunded and could be a great success. 

I would love to hear other thoughts on this company before I make a decision

15-02-24,2x0i90,"NASDAQ100 is making a new high for the 10th day in a row! This happened only 7 times since '85, can we profit from this?","Today the NASDAQ100 is making a new high for the 10th day in a row. This sparked my attention and I did some research. I calculated all the winning streaks from 1985. In other words if one day has a higher high than the previous day, it starts a 1-streak. If it continues the next day, we have a 2-streak, etc. until the high goes lower and the streak ends.

This is the result: http://imgur.com/ywr1vzi

In the first column you can see all the streaks. Understand that every 2-streak also counts as a 1-streak since every 2-streak has to start with a 1-streak obviously.

Second column show how much % goes x streak or higher. Today we have a 10-streak and there's only a 0,70% chance that the high will go higher than today.

Third column shows the separate streaks. So this time, we only calculate the end results. 2-streaks don't also count as 1-streaks.

Now the big question is: Is there a way to benefit from these odds? For example sell the NASDAQ100 when it hits the high of a 4 streak cause there's only a 13,31% chance it will go higher...

If I sell every time it does a 4-streak, I could jump in lower in 87% of the times. But it also means that I lose the profit of a potential 5-streak, 6-streak, 7-streak, ... etc. And the small times I profit from these big streaks, may outweigh the profits from jumping in lower 87% of the times.

Can I profit or is this just like a game of roulette where the odds on black or red always stay the same no matter what the streak is?

I have been attempting to develop my individual investment style by going both long and short and have been managing an account where **I generated 10.46% as of today by trading in and out of 10 different stocks since November 11th**.  This is versus the Russell 2000 return of roughly 4.4% for the same time period.

When compared with the Russell 2000 (since many of the stocks I've been trading in are below $2bn in mkt cap, and as low as $100mn I felt an appropriate benchmark) my **beta is 1.08** right now, and my **sharpe ratio is 3.08** when using the 1-year treasury return of 0.25% for the risk free rate.  My **Jensen's Alpha is 5.63%**.

My **average gross exposure has been 57% of total available capital** (so over the course of the past 3 months or so, after including short holdings as total of invested capital, 43% of my capital has been in cash).

Of my holdings one stock has accounted for 400 bps of return, another for 279, 214, and a misc between 20 and 70 bps, and 2 losers (-179 bps before cutting, with the position cut too early, and -46 for a short position that I believe will pan out post-earnings in the next couple of weeks).

I have been using a lot of fundamental analysis to understand the dynamics here, time my trades, and watch portfolio management to develop my abilities beyond simply stock picking.  **I've conducted 8 trades to completion** and currently hold a position in 6 stocks, with my long stocks returning 9.76% of my returns (currently long 4) and my short positions return .70%.  (I have only shorted for 3 trades, 2 of which are still playing out)

I want to keep between 8 - 12 stocks in my portfolio at any one time to be properly diversified but haven't had the capacity given work.

Does anyone have any advice for me on how to improve my portfolio management abilities, given the statistics above?  One idea I have is to be more fully vested with maybe 80% of total capital invested versus my 57% today.  Doing so would boost my returns while increasing my beta, but I don't know if that's a smart thing to do and something that potential investors would want to see in a track record.

I understand it's a short time frame but I'm working to learn as much as I can, and this is the first portfolio I've managed pretty much ""willy nilly.""  I manage my own money more aggressively and am more of an ""all-in"" stock picker, where managing risk is not a primary goal since I don't have many clients to answer to, and my returns in my PA have vastly outweighed this ""test portfolio"" I'm managing.

**EDIT:** I'm also curious, do hedge funds aim for betas below 1, or is close to 1 a good barometer of your risk management?  What is a good sharpe ratio? ",0
15-02-25,2x58kx,"For the love of investing, can someone explain in plain English what a PE ratio means for investing?","I understand how a PE ratio is calculated: Price of a stock/Yearly earnings for the corp. I understand that you want to compare PE ratios to industry averages. 

Some people are telling me that a low PE ratio compared to the industry average is indicative of a good thing. This means that the stock is undervalued.

Other people are telling me that a high PE ratio means that investors are willing to pay top dollar for a stock, and that demand is high or investors are confident in the stocks future performance prospects. 

I know this is an amateur question but can someone PLEASE help a business student understand?

15-02-25,2x35s9,How to become financially free,"I don't know why this isn't discussed much, but wouldn't it make sense to hedge your life expenses with the companies that you pay money to?

Example:

I pay about $200 a month for gas for my car. Why not invest in some oil companies that pay good dividends and receive enough dividends to cover the $200/month? That way I'd be getting my gas for free basically. For example, buy $30,000 of your favorite oil stock that pays around 8%. You'll get $200/month to cover your gas (you may need to invest 15-20% more since the dividends are taxed at about 15-20% depending on your tax bracket. 

You can do the same with your biggest expenses. Food $400. Alcohol, $300, Cell Phone $50, for a total of 950/month. 

So with about $150,000 you would get $1000 /month income before tax. + good companies will regularily raise their dividends.

Maybe not everyone had $150,000 right now, but if not, you shouldn't be spending $300/month on booze. Just save up a little bit until you get there.

Asset allocation is also important. Most people also pay rent or a mortgage. SO what you gotta do is either invest another 150k in REIT's that pay 8% dividend, or if you don't have that money, just buy a house with a couple extra rooms and rent them out to pay your mortgage. That way you have stocks, and real estate.

You'll have all your expenses covered with that scenario. Add your own custom expenses in there - insurance, hookers, internet, etc.

The beauty of it is even if the stock prices go down, the dividends still pay out the same amount guaranteed (until the next dividend meeting by the board of directors which could be monthly or quarterly).


With all your free time you can pursue what you really love in life. Plus the capital appreciation of your assets over the long term will increase as well. 

Simple? Yes. Maybe I should write a book!",0

I'd like to hedge a 401k against tail risk in case a stagflation type scenario presents itself. I'll do this by purchasing OTM puts on SPY and TLT in a taxable account. Most likely the puts will expire worthless leading to a capital gains loss. If the shit does hit the fan, the 401k could be converted to a Roth to lesson the blow a bit while the puts gain value in the taxable account.

This has the following advantages in my mind:

* Should provide a nice cap gains write off
* Allows me to buy relatively cheap puts (SPY and TLT) which I'm unable to buy in my 401k. 
* In an ugly downturn I might have a good opportunity to convert the 401k to a Roth.",9

I'm in my 20's and have a high risk tolerance. My current Roth IRA is in TLFRX 2050 LifeCycle fund which has a high ER of 0.71%. My other 403(b) funds are much cheaper.

Here are some funds I thought made sense, but perhaps there's too much overlap between funds (Large-Cap vs. S&amp;P) or better, cheaper options:

**HMNY** came out with news today but started going up yesterday. 
&gt;With only 357.02K Float and 84.66% held by insiders, I think it is pretty safe to say that this could run up a lot.

The 84% held by insiders means their **could** be something behind the scenes that we don't know about. Expecting a parabolic move over 5 in the morning to the .50 - .75 range. Only shorting parabolic moves because of the low float. Do not add to a position.

**BIOC** expecting a washout to about the 3.75 - 4 range in the morning after bad earnings were released. I will add to my position as long as the stock breaks and holds under 4. I will be using 4 as a guide thoughout the day.

**SGNL** is a ""dead pump bounce"", I called this happening a few days back. Expecting a washout below 3 and will risk on that point thoughout the day. Will ideally break 3 and fade back down to 2.50. 

**ARQL** is a pre-earnings play. People anticipating good earnings before they come out. It is tricky to say where the stock will be heading because people could take profits but at the same time want to hold. I will only get in this mid-day if a ""line in the sand"" pattern sets up. Risking on the high of the day if it does infact set up.

**VPCO** is a pumped up stock up a lot on bs. It finally showed its first strong red day after a few days of running. Expecting a nice washout to .20 - .25 mark and fading the rest of the day. http://www.boardcentral.com/boards/VPCO

**ll** is at a stock price that I rarely touch. I would love to see a rebound after a collapse on earnings. Will be buying if the ABCD pattern if it presents itself.

15-02-26,2xa4sx,HLF Earnings Analysis,"Was talking with someone in my previous thread about earnings quality.  Thought you would all like to see this because it really needs to be known here:

The **Accrual Ratio** is a gauge of quality of earnings and today you get to learn how to use this tool! The lower the accrual ratio the better. Zero generally means that you have generated all of the cash associated with your net income, while anything lower means your company generated more cash than net income. You calculate it by doing the following:

+ =[NOA (t) - NOA (t-1)] / Average NOA over period

+ Where t = period in time

+ and NOA = (Assets - Cash) / (Total Liabilities - Debt)

Now for the fun with HLF: 

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/faNAwzM.png)

The 99.4% of net income as accruals this quarter? It means they generate 0.6% of the net income they claim to have generated as actual cash this past quarter.

Note that NOA is artificially decreased by the write-downs this year (impairments will reduce the asset input of the NOA account) so actual accruals accounted for should be at least $150mn higher for the annual amounts (2nd table). This means that the 66% ratio should actually jump to *above 100%*. This means that they burned more cash than assets they added to the balance sheet.

As a fundamental-based investor I view this as very bad.",10

Penny stocks are stocks in small companies that trade for less than five dollars apiece. They’re quoted and traded on dealer networks like OTC Markets because they don’t meet the requirements to be traded on more formal exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange. They’re also extremely volatile. Shady stock promoters capitalize on this volatility by convincing others to buy stock in worthless companies to increase their value temporarily—the “pump”—before selling them—the “dump”—leaving naive investors holding the bag.

In 2014, pot companies had the most drastic ups and downs for penny stocks according to data analyzed by Openfolio, a social network for investors to share which stocks they’re trading. This indicates that pumping and dumping marijuana stocks has accelerated to a pretty insane degree.

According to the data, which Openfolio shared with Motherboard, stocks in Medical Marijuana Inc., an umbrella company that sells cannabis-based wellness products, are down 94.4 percent since their peak price in 2014 and investors lost a total of $1.7 billion. My Marijuana Canada, a company that grows and distributes medical weed, slid down a money ladder and is currently down 72.93 percent from its peak.

At the other end of the extreme, ordinary people are using mobile investing apps to simply automatically invest small amounts in passive index funds. Little attention however is going to approaches that actually aim to predict market movements by taking advantage of fundamental market inefficiencies. This is surprising, given today’s advances in artificial intelligence, big data and available computing power.

15-02-25,2x66fl,If Zenyatta Ventures can extract thier graphite in an economic manour they will be very successful (TSX VENTURE: ZEN),"Zenyatta: Initial Testing of Albany Graphite Yields Positive Results for Lithium Ion Battery Anode Application
12 Feb 2015 09:27 ET

Marketwire Canada
Zenyatta Ventures Ltd. (""Zenyatta"" or ""Company"") (TSX VENTURE: ZEN) embarked on a market development program over a year ago to initiate validation of Albany graphite in high purity graphite applications. Since the kick-off of this program, the Company has had detailed conversations with more than 35 graphite end-users, academic labs and third party testing facilities in Europe, North America and Asia under confidentiality agreements. Many of these organizations were provided a small amount of purified graphite material produced at SGS Canada Inc. ('SGS') Lakefield site during the development of a process flow sheet for the Albany graphite deposit pursuant to a preliminary economic assessment ('PEA') which is currently being completed. The samples produced at SGS are experimental in nature and may differ slightly from batch to batch and may also differ from the final product in the future. However these samples are representative of the product that could be processed and provide a good initial assessment and guidance for the potential of Albany graphite for various applications.

The goal of these initial samples was to screen Albany graphite for suitable applications while gathering feedback from the end-users and testing facilities to improve the overall properties for high value applications. The Company is now starting to receive feedback from several end-users and independent labs, some of which received repeat samples. Information from this initial test program will be used to further define the Company's product and market strategy and set the stage for next steps in development. Zenyatta plans to provide its stakeholders brief periodic updates on the progress as meaningful information becomes available. This is the first in a series of updates on the market and business developments.

Zenyatta is pleased to disclose that first testing has shown the performance of Albany graphite to be in the range of materials used presently for Lithium-ion Batteries ('LIB'). These initial tests, conducted by an independent lab, show that the performance of coated and shaped Albany graphite is equivalent to the leading high quality natural and synthetic graphite in commercial usage today. Testing was conducted by an independent Canadian lab using a lab-scale sample provided by SGS solely for the purpose of providing early evaluation on the suitability and effectiveness of Albany graphite in various applications. Similar positive results were also obtained on these samples by separate corporations who are in dialogue with the Company under confidentiality agreements.

Highlights:


--  First testing on Zenyatta purified graphite meets specifications for
    LIB's
--  Equivalent to leading high quality natural and synthetic graphite in
    commercial usage
--  LIB's represent 25-30% of Zenyatta's targeted market


This testing does not represent a statistically large sample size. Furthermore, these positive results do not mean that Zenyatta can extract and process Albany graphite for high purity graphite applications on an economic basis. Without a formal independent feasibility study, there is no assurance that the operation will be economic.

Dr. Bharat Chahar, VP of Market Development for Zenyatta stated, ""Since the purity and particle size of the material provided by SGS processing was already in the range needed for LIB application, no further milling or purification was needed. Compared to natural flake graphite supplied to the industry from China, no extra treatment and no dangerous hydrofluoric acid purification process were required to generate our material. No extensive milling was needed to prepare the Zenyatta graphite with minor loss of material occurring during the shaping process.""

The Zenyatta graphite material was classified and processed in a mechano-fusion machine by a standard industry technique to increase packed density of the material. The higher density Zenyatta material was coated to improve the irreversible capacity loss. Electrochemical tests were conducted using coin cells commonly used in the industry for screening purpose.

Dr. Chahar added, ""Due to simple mineralogy, high crystallinity and desirable particle size distribution, Zenyatta graphite has shown first testing specification ranges needed for the Li-ion battery industry. While further tests are ongoing by potential customers to verify other performance characteristics, this initial feedback on results is extremely encouraging. We now plan to carry out advanced testing with a full cell made from the Zenyatta graphite anode.""

Based on research and dialogue with end-users, at this point in time, Zenyatta expects to have a targeted market application segmentation which includes 25-30% for high purity graphite in Lithium-ion batteries. The remaining 70-75% target applications will be discussed in upcoming news releases.

Dr. Bharat Chahar, P.Eng, VP Market Development for Zenyatta, is a Qualified Person for the purposes of National Instrument 43-101 and has reviewed the technical information in this news release.

The LIB market is relatively large and shows high growth potential. Graphite for this market has to meet many challenging performance characteristics before it can be used in a LIB. Some of the critical performance criteria include high charge/discharge capacity, low irreversible capacity loss during initial cycling, long cycle life, long shelf life, high packing density, chemical stability and easy process ability. To meet these criteria, the natural flake graphite from China used in this application, is milled, shaped, purified and coated before it can be used as anode powder. There is approximately 40-60% yield loss in the milling and shaping process for most natural flake graphite suppliers in this industry today. Also the traditional graphite anode material is usually purified using expensive chemical or thermal processes. Zenyatta is working to develop a purification system that does not require use of these traditional processes for its unique graphite material.

Graphite is used as a host material in the anode to hold active lithium-ions which move in and out of the graphite layers during charging and discharging. Both natural and synthetic graphite can be used in battery applications depending on the manufacturer's needs. Generally the choice comes down to cost, purity and various other critical specifications. Purity levels required are high with most end-users stating that low impurity levels of certain metallic elements be kept to less than 200 parts per million ('ppm'). Zenyatta graphite does not contain any metallic impurities. Metallic impurities are very problematic to battery manufacturers and can cause the batteries to 'short' and disrupt the flow of charge; they can also react with the electrolyte. Reactions with the electrolyte can lead to decomposition and premature aging of the anode.

Additionally, it is critical that the graphite has a narrow particle size distribution and consistency throughout the anode material. Battery manufacturers are very strict on specifications and require rigorous testing. Once supply contract negotiations start, they generally will not allow any change in the agreed specifications without further repeated and thorough testing.

The market for rechargeable lithium batteries can be split into four product groupings:

-- Computing, communication and consumer ('3C') products -- used in small devices that are portable or used in the home such as mobile phones, laptops, MP3 players; -- Power devices and small motive power -- power tools and electric bicycles; -- Heavy duty -- on and off grid energy storage; and -- Transportation -- electric vehicles ('EVs') and hybrid electric vehicles ('HEVs'), buses and trains.

Future growth in demand for rechargeable batteries in unit terms will continue to be led by 3C products through to 2018, but in capacity terms (MWh), power applications, heavy duty, and particularly transportation, will grow in importance. The current market for graphite in batteries is approximately 100,000 tonnes and is forecast to grow by 10-15% per year to greater than 180,000 tonnes in 2018, based mostly on the growth in the LIB sector.

Actual results relating to, among other things, results of exploration, metallurgical processing, project development, market development, reclamation and capital costs of Zenyatta's mineral properties, and Zenyatta's financial condition and prospects, could differ materially from those currently anticipated in such statements for many reasons such as, but are not limited to: failure to identify mineral resources; failure to convert estimated mineral resources to reserves; the inability to complete a prefeasibility study; the preliminary nature of metallurgical test results; the inability to enter into offtake agreements with qualified purchasers; delays in obtaining or failures to obtain required governmental, environmental or other project approvals; political risks; uncertainties relating to the availability and costs of financing needed in the future; changes in equity markets, inflation, changes in exchange rates; fluctuations in commodity prices; delays in the development of projects; capital and operating costs varying significantly from estimates and the other risks involved in the mineral exploration and development industry; and those risks set out in Zenyatta's public documents filed on SEDAR. This list is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect any of Zenyatta's forward-looking statements. These and other factors should be considered carefully and readers should not place undue reliance on Zenyatta's forward-looking statements. Although Zenyatta believes that the assumptions and factors used in preparing the forward-looking information in this news release are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on such information, which only applies as of the date of this news release, and no assurance can be given that such events will occur in the disclosed time frames or at all.

[Jul 17 2015 2.50 Put(@AMD)](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/amd/option-chain?money=all&amp;dateindex=3)

Today is February, so that puts the Jul 17 PUT option as 5 months from now. I normally see huge amounts of open-interest in the next couple of months (ie: March / April). But for some reason, the market seems most interested in July.

In particular, the ""Jul 17 2015 2.50 PUT"" have an abnormally huge amount of open interest (229,793 Open Interest). Most of AMD's options have open-interest measured in the tens of thousands at the most (maybe thousands). So seeing over 200k open interest at a single strike-point stands out to me as unusual. So I'm trying to grok it and understand.

Here's my interpretation: someone is very worried that AMD's stock is going to drop below $2.50 in July. The next largest Open Interest for AMD is the Jan 2016 LEAP, with over 100,000 Open Interest right now for the $2.5 PUT, which confirms the worries at the $2.50 price point.

The reverse, which is the Jul 17 2015 $3.00 CALL only has 80,000 Open Interest. So the ""market"" in general seems more worried about AMD going down than it going up.

Anyway, is there anything special about this date? As far as I can tell, Jul 17 is going to be after the 10-Q May quarterly report from AMD. Is it normal for a stock to have a huge amount of open-interest on the Options that follow a quarterly report? The Jan 2016 is a LEAP, so I know those act differently.

Any help in interpreting these abnormally large ""open interest"" positions would be great! Thank you.

SFX Entertainment Shareholder Alert - National Securities Law Firm Seeks Higher Price For Shareholders In Connection With Proposed Acquisition. Encourages Shareholders To Contact Law Firm For More Information
2 hours 28 minutes ago - DJNF
NEW YORK, Feb. 25, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Tripp Levy PLLC, a leading national securities and shareholder rights law firm, announces that it is investigating the proposed acquisition of SFX Entertainment Inc. (NASDAQ: ""SFXE"") (""SFX"" or the ""Company"") on behalf of its' shareholders. Robert F.X. Sillerman, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of SFX has proposed to acquire all the outstanding shares of SFX that he does not already own for only $4.75 per share in cash.
Our investigation has determined that the offer price of only $4.75 per share unfairly under-values the true going forward inherent value of the Company and that shareholders are not receiving the maximum value for their shares. Indeed, among other things, analysts have projected the Company is worth at least $12 per share, the stock has traded as high as $9 per share within the past year, and the Company's book value is over $3 per share. Our investigation further seeks to determine whether Mr. Sillerman is acting for his own personal self-interests at the expense of the Company's shareholders.

If you are a shareholder of SFX and would like additional information as to how the acquisition may affect your rights as a shareholder, and how you may be eligible to obtain a higher price for your shares, please call us at no cost at:

**ARQL** is NOT a low float stock, it is just running on message board hype. They are releasing earnings on March 4th and a lot of people are saying it is going to be ""amazing earnings"". Expecting either a 2 ""stuff"" (where it just stuffs 2 and can't break it), or a 2 parabolic to around the .25 -50 range. Will be shorting green to red.

**CYTX** is up on ""FDA approval to expand the number of Scleroderma clinical trial sites from 12 to 20 centers in the United States"". I will be shorting a ""back side of move"" using .50 as a guide. **Not shorting any parabolic moves**.

**CYCC** is a short squeeze + a pump. No news came out on this stock at all. Will keep this on my ""second"" watchlist and will be shorting any morning washout.

**ZAGG** is a classic running stock. This stock is well known for being a pump and dump, it has been pumped 275 times by pumpers. But thats not why it's up this time. Zacks analysts + board of Directors Authorizes $15 Million for Stock Repurchase + Reports Financial Results for Fourth Quarter. Expecting it to actually stuff into 8.

I run an online retail business and so rely on Australia’s postal system to a large extent. Believe me; I am very familiar with the staff at my local outlet. I recently got a big order from a client worth $700, which I duly dispatched only to receive a complaint from the client a week later that the stock still hadn’t arrived. After some chasing it appears it is lost in the mail.

I had to dispatch another $700 worth of stock to the client and my complaints to the provider (who will remain nameless!) appear to have fallen on deaf ears. All I have been offered so far is some free postal packaging that’s worth about $10 and does little to makeup for my $700 loss.

Do I just grin and bear it?

Going postal,
Perth



 

Dear Going Postal,

Trust me when I say you are not alone in your frustrations with our beloved postal system.

If you have already complained to the provider and you are unhappy with the resolution offered there is a Postal Industry Ombudsman, who you can pass on your complaint to. I find a good vent on social media often does wonders for the spirit as well.

I know it’s not helpful for this occasion but for your next big order you are offered more protection by posting your stock through registered mail. Just be aware this costs extra and for stock worth $700 you will need to pay extra again.

If it does happen again perhaps it’s time to consider one of the many SME courier companies that are springing up as an alternative to our national postal provider. It will at least make you feel warm and fuzzy to support another small business.

Be Smart,
Your Aunty B

But, even excluding that, this seems like the kind of stock that's going to get a little frothy going forward.  It's outright cheap, right now, given the cash on hand, and the board is likely to authorize an even larger repurchase than last year, which is going to push up EPS and the share price.

Due to high cost of real estate and increasing decentralization, cities like Coimbatore are becoming growing IT and automobile hubs. With the slow growth in real estate, higher appreciation is expected to be observed in Tier II cities like Coimbatore.

15-02-25,2x4uhv,Confused about how margin was used,"This is on TDAmeritrade and probably a n00b question, but I searched so bear with me.

I made an order last night that went through this morning, and even though I had/have cash in the account margin was used(or at least my margin balance went down by the price of the trade).  I've re-stepped through the purchase I made and don't see any indication of why margin would have been used.  So I guess my question is two-fold:

1) How/where do I specify how I want margin to be used(or not) for a Buy order?  This isn't my first Buy since having a margin account but it is the first time margin was actually used.

2) Is it possible to ""swap"" out the margin balance for my cash balance, or do I need to sell and re-buy?",2

**BIOC** had a conference call to ""4:30 p.m. ET to discuss the financial results and provide a company update."". Most likely down on that, earnings are a while away (March 9th). Anticipating a washout toward 3 and will use that as a guide for the rest of the day.

**ARQL** is NOT a low float stock, it is just running on message board hype. They are releasing earnings on March 4th and a lot of people are saying it is going to be ""amazing earnings"". Expecting either a 2 ""stuff"" (where it just stuffs 2 and can't break it), or a 2 parabolic to around the .25 -50 range. Will be shorting green to red.

**CYTX** is up on ""FDA approval to expand the number of Scleroderma clinical trial sites from 12 to 20 centers in the United States"". I will be shorting a ""back side of move"" using .50 as a guide. **Not shorting any parabolic moves**.

**CYCC** is a short squeeze + a pump. No news came out on this stock at all. Will keep this on my ""second"" watchlist and will be shorting any morning washout.

**ZAGG** is a classic running stock. This stock is well known for being a pump and dump, it has been pumped 275 times by pumpers. But thats not why it's up this time. Zacks analysts + board of Directors Authorizes $15 Million for Stock Repurchase + Reports Financial Results for Fourth Quarter. Expecting it to actually stuff into 8.

15-02-27,2xdxu9,Thoughts on WTW (Weightwatchers),"As of now, WTW is down almost 35%. Value opportunity? Maybe.

TL;DR: 
WTW has a strong brand image and has already created all the tech to compete with free and cheaper fitness apps. 

Fitness apps are clearly not working for overweight ppl, if anything obesity rates especially in children, have increased. 

WTW corporate plans could benefit from Obamacare as employers want to keep insurance payouts as low as possible.

Income and employment increase means more eating and makes WTW's relatively expensive plans more viable.

Thesis:
WTW has seen year over year decline in online and in person subscribers. Weak guidance has sent the stock down to record lows.  WTW already has the technology to compete with free fitness and calorie counting apps (wearable integration, mobile apps, etc.), I think they just need to figure out their price point. In person meetings definitely has much more overhead than online subscriptions. Removal or scaling back of this program and reducing online coach prices could make WTW competitive.

Corporate market is especially huge now with healthcare changes. While individual WTW plans may be expensive, it could def be cheaper for companies to enroll in WTW meetings as long as they work and prevent obesity related medical payouts.

People arent stupid but they also arent disciplined. WTW has trusted brand image of nonfad actually working diet plans. As income increases it will become easier for ppl to pay for guided support than fuck around with free fitness apps.

Weak expectations already factored in to price, WTW doesnt have to start making money eventually. Instead making corporate changes like those above could drive price up.

15-02-26,2x7kdj,Getting Motivated! Day 0,"Hello to anyone reading this... 

I am starting up my 30 day challenge! In these 30 days I will be posting daily about my plays. This will include what I'm in at, what I am investing in, WHY I am investing in that (HONESTLY), how much I gained, what I started with, etc. 

A little about my (non-personal) self: I started trading with around 5k in funds. I held some longterm blue chip in HP, Mylan (pharma), REIT (biggest mistake of my life), and some others for around all of 2013. I grew impatient with my gains (and losses), as I was looking for more excitement/a quicker increase in portfolio value. As a college student, the 5k I mustered up was all I could make do with. I quickly found I couldn't do much BC-wise as far as day/swing trading goes due to sheer lack of volume (and knowledge) I could purchase. I found this sub around February of 2013 and quickly became addicted to the trading style associated with pinks. Long story short, I ended up making around $7,500 in about 4 months. Awesome, right? Right. So, whats the catch, what happened? Why am I even here posting? Well, it was simple....

I lost motivation. I had no real reason to be making the extra cash, and the hours that needed to be put in to trading successfully were actually taking a tole on my social, and academic lifestyle. So, I stopped. I told myself I made enough for my age to be comfortable w/ my outgoing finances, per diem, etc... Fast forward to now, and I look at my E*Trade account and what do I see is left from my earnings? $591.67. Yep. I had blown through nearly 13k in 6 and a half months on mindless garbage (a motorcycle, tv, presents for loved ones). This. Is. Bad.

Now on to the main point here. How did I get that return in the first place? It was simple. Scanners, PAD's and believe it or not, this sub. I will be using the same techniques, because why fix it if it ain't broke, right? I take absolutely no shame in riding a pump. I take no shame in shorting a pump. I'm here to make money, not worry about whether a business has any credentials fiscally - welcome to PS. I use and will continue to use techniques and resources I learned/found here in this sub to increase my earnings. 

I will try and post screenshots/live updates as I am trading tomorrow morning. If you have any questions, feel free to ask, and I will try to reply as promptly as possible. If you have any criticism or suggestions, even better but keep in mind I am not here seeking help. Just documentation for motivation purposes, and maybe it will help people new to this sub. 

Tools: E*Trade Pro w/ scanners preset - will give settings tomorrow.

          Selling half of holdings at 10% gains, no mercy.

Vanguard is the largest mutual fund company in the world, with several trillion dollars in investments.

This is their mutual fund with the highest average ROI. From their website, it has averaged 17.43% since inception, 12.5% last 10 years and 20.17% in the last 5 years.

I know that the stock market grows on average by about 8% a year, but the majority of investors actually get a lower return than this.

Can you point me to any investments that can beat this? I'm going to have like 180,000 to invest in a few months.

15-02-27,2xe487,Questions about taxes,"It's my understanding that if you make profit of a stock and sell it within a year of a purchase date you have to pay 25% in taxes (depending on tax bracket.) However, if you hold it over a year then it's only 15% in taxes (also depending on tax bracket.)

What if you buy the same stock at different times of the year and then sell some if it before the second purchase has been over a year? For example

Buy 50 shares of stock A on January 1st, 2013. 
Buy another 50 shares of stock A on June 1st, 2013.
Sell 75 shares of stock A on February 1st, 2014.

15-02-27,2xc2hg,Is it a bad idea to put the bulk of my money into one index fund?,"I've been thinking about moving my savings from a few different holdings to just one index fund such as the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Investor Shares (VFINX). Is this a bad idea? The way I understand it, index funds are collections of holdings (500 in this case), so your risk if one company goes under is much less. However, I am a bit wary about placing all my money solely in Vanguard. For whatever reasons, is it a bad idea to just use one index fund and dump all or most of your money in there? Does anyone normally have their money in a few different index funds, and what would be the reasoning behind that? The way I understand it, index funds are safer than holding just a few companies' stocks. Is it possible that Vanguard itself could have a scandal or anything else negative happen to the company which would cause the Vanguard 500 stock to decrease?",6
15-02-27,2xe6ho,Dodge Cox vs Vanguard,"This is really general, and I apologize for that in advance. I am by no means a pro investor. This might even belong in moronic Monday. Anyway, if you're still reading:

My stepfather in law manages my wife and my funds. For the most part, I prefer it this way. He has managed a 15% return for the past 3 years. Recently, he retired from his engineering job and started a small business managing funds. He started taking a fee, so I started taking a look at what he does.

We recently have ramped up investing, where before it was $200/mo, now it's $3000/mo. So again, there's a lot more reason to pay attention.

I have noticed he prefers dodge cox over vanguards. To my knowledge, they have had near identical performance to vanguard, except higher fees. So I'm trying to figure out why he prefers them so much. His only response to me is that he has had tons of success with dodge cox, but we could ""switch if I wanted."" I would think the best route (if this was indeed a good idea to switch) would be to keep everything I have with dodge cox and just stop buying. Switch buys to vanguard instead.

Can someone more knowledgeable fill me in?

15-02-27,2xedb8,Breakdown Of The Calls I made,"&gt;**BIOC** had a conference call to ""4:30 p.m. ET to discuss the financial results and provide a company update."". Most likely down on that, earnings are a while away (March 9th). Anticipating a washout toward 3 and will use that as a guide for the rest of the day.

I actually hit this stock dead on, unfortunately I wasn't able to trade it because I was really sick this morning. :(. I actually did see it when I was in bed but didn't want to jump into it unless I was positive. I really think I missed out on a near perfect trade. 

-
&gt;**ARQL** is NOT a low float stock, it is just running on message board hype. They are releasing earnings on March 4th and a lot of people are saying it is going to be ""amazing earnings"". Expecting either a 2 ""stuff"" (where it just stuffs 2 and can't break it), or a 2 parabolic to around the .25 -50 range. Will be shorting green to red.

I kinda got this one right. The thing was, it really never got to the 2 mark. I really felt like their wasn't that much upside to this stock anyway. Unless it outright collapsed I wasn't going to trade it, overall it was just ""ok""

-
&gt;**CYTX** is up on ""FDA approval to expand the number of Scleroderma clinical trial sites from 12 to 20 centers in the United States"". I will be shorting a ""back side of move"" using .50 as a guide. **Not shorting any parabolic moves**.

Was kinda a sloppy stock. It never actually did anything I wanted, it just washed out and flatlined. Stocks like this are ones that I just ignore for the most part. If I wasn't so sick in the morning I would likely have possibly risked on the .40 mark, oh well.

-
&gt;**CYCC** is a short squeeze + a pump. No news came out on this stock at all. Will keep this on my ""second"" watchlist and will be shorting any morning washout.

This is the only stock I traded today. It was later day when I felt a little bit better. I got in at 1.68 and got out at 1.61, I was too afraid it was going to bounce off the 1.61 mark. Unfortunately, it didn't. The ""back side the trade"" was very clear on this stock, which is why I was able to get a decent trade.

-
&gt;**ZAGG** is a classic running stock. This stock is well known for being a pump and dump, it has been pumped 275 times by pumpers. But thats not why it's up this time. Zacks analysts + board of Directors Authorizes $15 Million for Stock Repurchase + Reports Financial Results for Fourth Quarter. Expecting it to actually stuff into 8. Will use 8 as a guide for the rest of the day.

I actually got this call correct, I just didn't trade it (again, because I was sick in the morning with a really bad stomach). It played out perfectly and I missed a whole 40-50 cents of upside. Really unfortunate but whatever, at least I got the call correct.

-

Did anyone here trade the stocks I put on my watchlist, if so how did you do?!

Wow! I forgot how exciting this is! Sitting here with my morning tea, rushing through some basic DD before the opening bell, trying to assess my scanners/iHub/PaD.com - this is insane!

Not sure if any of you are even up yet, and I know it's still early, but I think today is going to be a slow storm. 

Im gonna try and get in CLRX @ 2.27 ish and probably only for 100.00 - this play worries me, as does the chart. There is a heavy preload on this pump and I might not be able to ride the wave.

Also, Im gonna play the OPXS... hopefully @ around .0105 as the chart looks promising and it seems like a sleeper in the PaD realm. 

See you in a bit, I'll try and keep you updated - still unsure on how to post screen shots! 

Thanks, -- Thatch

Update: ~10 minutes until the bell and ATOS and CYTX are blowing up my scanners. Unfortunately I can't get in, fairly frustrated.

Update: ~5 minutes until open and I decided to try and get CYTX in @.84 - after further review of CLRX... I think i might have fucked up early... oh well. Good thing I forgot I was sitting on 10 shares of TSLA... selling 2 for around 400.00.

Update: Alright so, just went out on CYTX @.85 - I got in at .78 with 100 shares. Nice. CLRX is a tank, hopefully it will swing up by the end of the day. I am in @1.49 for 25. 

Update: Well, today was a little disappointing. CLRX just hit and sold in my safe zone for 1.51... I was in @ 1.48. You win some you lose some. On to the next one... looking for a floater I can watch build throughout the day. I'll post when I find one.

Update: back in CYTX @ .929 for 100 - looking to profit on the dollar roll over

Update: Gotta work on my patience/discipline... or maybe cut back on the caffeine -_- 

Update: currently deciding a buy in on CLRX on the low - News claims they are gonna basically aim to ""give out"" shares for around 1.27, hopefully it'll drop within the next 2 hours and I can snatch it and wait for the upturn

Update: ^^ nahhh... Looking into the gamble of DNAX - top of the boards right now. no movement. .000 plays are the RISKIEST, as if you dont get lucky, your stuck with it. Happened to me with PHMB. Do I want to risk it again? .000 plays are starting to breakout but why hasn't the #1 spot yet? 

UPDATE: CYTX about to roll over!!

Update: in with DNAX @.0002 for 475,000... wish me luck?

Update: out on CYTX @1.10 from .85 for 100 half of the 200 total bought, and then again from .92 - completely out now on CYTX. Closing out the chart - focusing on positive energy on DNAX hoping it jumps to my .0004 sell mark.

Update: still sitting on DNAX, seems to be some activity on the boards (increase in posts and rating), pretty excited for the (POSSIBLE) jump (IF IT HAPPENS). Plan to be out at .0004 for around $100 gain. Hopefully that happens my glass is currently half empty.

Update: alright, looks like lunch slowed down the market for now lol. Unfortunately DANX is now at .0001 - am i worried? yes. a loss is a loss though, and the market isn't closed yet. the boards are pushing for it to jump and so am I! - looking into tomorrow plays. I'm thinking CLRX is going to be a great swing trade.

Update: DANX volume going up - lets go!

Update: alriiiight so, it looks as though my time for today is done (I will post a 'wrap up' here tonight). I have put in a buy order on CLRX @ 1.45 if it drops again in the attempts of a swing trade for tomorrow. Still waiting for DANX to close out - fingers crossed! ",15

(Not with the goal of just jumping on a hot trend, but I've always been vaguely troubled by the unintended effect of investing more in a sector just because it has more companies... and this seems like a great cure.)  And a halving of the expense ratio vs. RSP doesn't hurt either.  

I do wish they'd have used the S&amp;P500 instead of the Russell1000 index as a starting point, though.  This is going to muddy up my sector allocations between large cap and mid cap.

15-02-27,2xenhr,One of my holdings (TSE: CHR.B) seems highly undervalued. What am I missing?,"Most of my stock holdings at present are relatively high yielding shares that I feel are safe from a capital perspective. Capital growth is nice, but the main reason for purchasing was for the dividend. That said, one of my holdings seems really undervalued to me. Chorus Aviation (CHR.B) on the Toronto exchange derives most of it's revenue from a capacity purchase agreement with Air Canada, in which it is guaranteed a minimum amount of revenue in turn for operating Air Canada marketed regional flights. In the past few years the share price was depressed due to uncertainty regarding the relationship with Air Canada, and whether a new agreement wold be signed.

In January, a new 10 year agreement was signed, as well as new union agreements, which according to the company would ensure the dividend could be maintained. Following this news the price rose during late January and early February. Last week the company announced their strong Q4 results, and unexpectedly increased the dividend. Since then the share price has fallen 6%. Based on today's close and the value of the increased dividend (coming in April), the yield is 8.63%. This seems absurdly high in the current low interest rate environment, when considering that all indications suggest this dividend is safe for 10 years (short of significant unforeseen circumstances). I'm complete at a loss for why the share price isn't significantly higher, given that other popular income producing equities trade in a range of 4-5% yields.

I thought I would post the link here, if you haven't already heard. Tesla popped on the rumor. Apple is obviously a cash rich company, and their new project Titan is getting a lot of press. Tesla has talked about their significant need for capital. 

Edit: Redundant Sentence Structure

Edit 2: 
To be clear, this was a rumor that was bouncing around the investing world this morning. Tesla was at 202.49ish and jumped quickly to 210.80ish once the rumor surfaced. No major news outlets picked up the story. This post was to report the rumor. I, obviously, cannot speak to the truthfulness of the rumor. ",174

15-02-26,2x8vyu,Reddit User Asks Me To Analyze Their Portfolio.,"Reddit User Asks Me To Analyze Their Portfolio.  I told him Id do, but I was going to make the post public.  Ill keep his username secret tho.

""TCPI, XOM, USB, ATVI and a couple of index funds in MINDX and FLPSX.""

TCPI - A micro cap business that makes LED lights.  I know nothing about the industry and probably less about judging micro caps.  Revenues are up and the debt is manageable.  I have no opinion of them.

XOM - From what I can tell, it looks like the entire oil industry peaked in 2011 and have faced falling revenues since then.  So it's not like their relative cheapness to the rest of the market is entirely due to the $50 oil barrel.  Their earnings have been flat too.  Cash flows are declining.  

With all that said, I know next to nothing about the energy sector.  Are renewables a threat?  Are battery and hydrogen cars the future?  Yes, it's just a matter of time.  10 years?  20 years?  Who knows.  What does that mean for the oil industry?  I don't know.  It's not a field that I really understand.

USB - Debt is on the high side. Revenue growth is trailing the market.  Earnings growth is pathetic.  Debt is certainly on the high side for such a slow growth company.  

If you want a bank, then Id recommend Wells Fargo.  Revenues have been decreasing for the entire banking sector, and Wells is included, but they actually been able to increase Net Income.  More important to me, they weren't caught with their pants down during the housing crisis.  They're a quality, conservative business and are really the standard bearers for banks everywhere.  Plus, they're actually selling at a lower PE ratio than USB.

ATVI - Oh boy.  Yknow, Im a pretty big gaming nerd myself.  I waited for years for Blizzard to go public.  They have some amazing IP.  Warcraft, StarCraft, Diablo.  It wasn't that long ago you could walk into a Walmart and still find the original Star Craft selling for $20.  That's the kind of product cycle that is completely unheard of in software, let alone gaming.  

WOW is essentially a license to print money.  Id never touch the game, cuz I know it's crack cocaine.  DOTA is an amazing game.  Not sure how much money they actually make from it tho, and they're competing with Valve over it.

But my heart sank when they were acquired by Activision.  Activision is almost as bad as Midway.  Jesus.  Maybe that isn't true anymore, because of Call of Duty, but that was always my impression of them.  Well, enough talk, let's dive into the numbers.  Revenues have been flat since 2009.  Im guessing that's when they acquired Blizzard?  Yea, 2008.  That makes sense.  Net incomes are down.

Yea Ill be honest.  I can believe that the company has a bright future ahead.  Without even checking, I can be sure that WOW2 is being made.  Likely meant to release alongside the Warcraft movie coming out soon.  

They've gone to the StarCraft and Diablo well too recently to expect more soon.  Call of Duty is great, but you're not gonna get much growth out of it.  Tony Hawk and Guitar Hero are obviously dead horses.  I guess Skylanders is popular, but Disney is competing with them now.  And Id put my money on Star Wars and the Avengers over Skylanders.

The real problem is, at 26 times earnings, the prospects of growth are already priced in.  WOW2 would have to come out and be a success, just for you to get a decent return.  I think the price is jacked up due to fan boys.  Kind like Nintendo.

MINDX - An indian mutual fund.  If I was going to bet on one country, it'd be America.  No other country is even close on this one.  Other countries may have better wealth equality, and schools, and health, and crime rates, and police abuses rates, and civil liberties, etc, etc.  But when it comes to good ol fashion economic growth, you can't bet against the king.

FLPSX - ""The fund normally invests primarily in common stocks and invests at least 80% of assets in low-priced stocks (those priced at or below $35 per share)""  That has to be the stupidest criteria Ive ever seen for an index.  I should open up my own index called the Double A-Fund.  It'll only buy stocks whose sticker has two A's in it.

Recommendation - No opinion the micro cap. Id trade my Bancorp stock for Wells.  XOM I have no idea really.  I suspect no one else does either.  I think it's too hard to predict something as government dependent as the future of energy.  My general opinion is that oil is not a viable 10-15 year strategy.  In the short term.  Who knows.  And then Activision is a sell unless you have some insight on some screaming software coming out that the market isn't appreciating.

Edit:  Forgot to mention, I'd take my money from the index funds and put them into VFINX or VOO.  Theyre Vanguard indices that track the SP 500.",6
15-02-27,2xcnex,"Vitamin Blue Confirms Record Revenue for 2014, Up 60% Year Over Year","COSTA MESA, CA--(Marketwired - February 20, 2015) - Vitamin Blue (OTC PINK: VTMB) announced its best year in growth and revenue, coming in at an increase of 60% compared to 2013. This is 4% better than the 56% forecasted at the end of last year. The company attributes this growth to growing expansion of the business and brand, an uptick in new customers who are discovering Stand Up Paddle boarding, and a strong boost in online sales. Final revenue from Amazon sales increased 73% year over year while eBay was even stronger coming in with a 109% increase over 2013.

First quarter of 2015 is continuing the trend in growing online sales. Both sales on Amazon and eBay are up 78% at the midpoint of Q1 compared to the same time period in 2014.

""We are proud of what we accomplished in 2014,"" commented Frank Ornelas, CEO of Vitamin Blue. ""We plan on adding new channels and opportunities in the next several months to help us keep the foot on the gas in successfully continuing to drive even higher online sales in 2015.""",0

Because I had sold covered calls, I wasn't allowed to place a stop-loss on my position.

What are your exit strategies? Do you exit fluidly or at a very specific point? What valuation method do you use?

To share my: I like to use Graham's number to decide the value of a company. I look at long-term (~5 + years) P/E averages and P/B averages using them to calculate Graham number to decide a maximum entry point. If technicals (or non-quantifiable fundamentals) look unfavorable, I will not enter. and dividends with a payout ratio greater than 65% and a dividend greater than 3%. The one exception to the dividend rules are growth stocks; however, I currently have none in my portfolio because I believe they are overbought.

I also like to keep a small, focused, diversified portfolio. What I mean is that I like to hold stocks in, minimally, three unrelated industries with a maximum of four stocks each. I also hold less than 20 stocks at any given time.

In addition to the points listed above, I look at company debt, cash flow, and so on. If there is interest I can elaborate more.",1

http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/2uztq7/irbt_up_5_since_yesterday_here_are_my_ten_small/

Here are the prices and gains and such... quick math I apologize:

AWAY 31ish up from 27 (up 12+%)

TWOU 18.60 up from 18.15 (up 3%)

EGHT 7.40 down from 7.80 (down 5%)

CUBI 22.30 flattish from 22.25 (flat)

BCEI 28.34 down from 30 (down 7ish%)

ASEI 51.30 down from 53.40 (down 5%)

IRBT 32.80 up from 30.75 (up 6ish%)

LGND 55 up from 50.85 (up 8%)

VNOM 19 flat from 19 (flat)

QFOR .52 up from .46 (up 12ish)

Market up roughly 3% so basket fairly in line on average

RECOMMENDATIONS: 

BCEI: my largest loser was a levered E&amp;P and as such I figured would take time to work.  I would add SN and OAS to the name and buy the basket.  Each should have 50% upside.

AWAY: Biggest winner... I'd be neither a buyer nor a seller, would have sold post earnings at $33. I think it can go to $35 but I'm kind of the ""I made good money and I'll take my profits"" mindset.

TWOU:  Still favorite story, crushed earnings last night, I'd be a buyer in fistfuls.

EGHT:  I still think its a buy, just going to take time to work... Long term buy and hold here.

CUBI: Same as EGHT

ASEI: Same as EGHT and CUBI except I would be a buyer into next quarters earnings depending on headlines that come.

IRBT:  Still a buyer, still very cheap.  Think it can go above $35 in next 3 months.

LGND:  Still a buyer, I've done well with it, sold some at $58 but I owned a lot so it was a loss of conviction but more a diversification concern.

VNOM: Buy and wait.  Will throw off nice dividends, rip up if price of oil goes up.

QFOR: Just signed biggest contract they're ever had, stock didn't budge.  My largest personal position.  Max conviction on the stock.

ADDS:
AVAV - FAA just released preliminary guidelines for drone rules, these guys are well positioned for police contracts... good story to ride into the next year... can go to $35 in NTM. I'd sell AWAY and slide into this.

SN and OAS as I mentioned above - build third positions in BCEI, SN, and OAS and you should have a nice energy w/ juice exposure

Hope that helps guys and let me know if you have any questions.

15-02-28,2xf80v,Is splitting your contributions to a 401k and Roth evenly a bad idea due to the benefits of compounding ?,"I am currently 29 years old and just a few months ago started contributing to my 401k and Roth IRA.  I have been trying to do as much research as I can on the topics, and which to invest in, but come across a lot of extremely biased opinions for either side making it hard to decide which one to contribute to.  I also didn't invest before because I didn't see the purpose of losing out on this money now and not being able to touch it until retirement when I feel the currency inflation rates would make it less valuable, and I can put my money to better use now.  I currently make 120k/year.  My company matches 50% up to 6% of my contributions.  I decided to split my contributions evenly between my 401k and my Roth.  So I currently contribute 6% total, 3% to my 401k and 3% to my IRA.  Is this a bad idea because of the compounding benefits of each account or would it eventually equate to the same amount?  Would I be better off contributing all 6% to my 401k or Roth rather than splitting it in half and only contributing 3% to each?
Also, I understand a 401K is taxed at the time of retirement, and have read some comments that it is taxed based off your current tax bracket at that time.  Is that true, and if so, what is to stop someone who is making a lot in a higher bracket to just pick up a low paying job their last year of working before retirement so they're taxed in a lower bracket rather than the higher bracket at the end?  Is your 401K taxed at the end based off its total worth or the amount you're making when you retire?  

Thank you in advance, it is just a bit overwhelming and I am not sure if I am essentially screwing myself over by splitting my contributions to each one in half.  I plan on buying a house soon and need to save as much as I can for a downpayment so don't want to tie up too much money in a retirement fund at the moment.",1

15-02-27,2xdbj5,Meet the man who could own Aviva France,"[Article Link Here](http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2015/02/27/2120422/meet-the-man-who-could-own-aviva-france/)  

When he was seven years old, Max-Hervé George was given a magic ticket by his father. It lets him turn back the clock, to invest with perfect hindsight week after week, steadily accumulating a fortune.

The ticket is a life insurance contract and Mr George, now 25, has fought for years in the French courts to preserve its magic. He could be a billionaire by the end of this decade and, by the end of the next, his contract would be worth more than the insurance company which stands behind it, Aviva France.

There is no mystery to the financial magic, however. Instead it is a story of grand stupidity, of how a French insurer wrote the worst contract in the world and sold it to thousands of clients.

The company was L’Abeille Vie. In 1987 it began to offer a special deal to its richer clients, a Fixed Price Arbitrage Life Insurance Contract.

Life insurance is a popular savings product in France, and typically the customer allocates their money among different investment funds offered by the insurer. But this contract was not typical: prices for the funds were published each Friday, and clients were allowed to switch funds at those prices anytime before the next price was published, even if markets moved in the meantime.

L’Abeille Vie called this an arbitrage, but really it was a gift. Is the stock market up this week? Just call your broker to buy it at last week’s price and pocket the difference.

In a world where the price of everything is now a mouse click away, offering a hindsight investment service seems incredible, if not suicidal. Yet thirty years ago prices for funds were published infrequently. Trading involved calling your broker, visiting him person, or maybe sending a fax. It could take days for the trade to be processed, during which time the market could move again.

L’Abeille Vie was not alone in the madness. Other insurers, including Axa and a group now owned by Allianz, also offered “known price” contracts to rich customers.

It may be that the opportunity to talk to the wealthiest clients on a regular basis was the incentive, or executives thought the work involved meant few would take full advantage of the opportunity. Perhaps life insurance was a great business and they didn’t ponder the consequences.

As financial information became more accessible in the 1990s, insurance companies began to realise the danger of hindsight terms. They started to persuade customers to amend the contracts, paying them to give up the right to trade at week-old prices.

The important thing to realise about insurance is the sanctity of contract. You might finagle the meaning of a particular term, but the whole point is for the writer to stand behind what was agreed. Regulators do not let insurers unilaterally change their terms.

In 1997 L’Abeille Vie’s known price deal was still available and Mr George senior took out polices for the whole family, depositing Fr50,000 (almost E8,000) in the name of young Max-Hervé.

Shortly afterwards, Abeille Vie — which had by then been absorbed into Commercial Union — stopped selling magic tickets. It could not tear up thousands of contracts, so it tried a more subtle tactic: policy holders were sent new papers, with the offer of 100 francs for the trouble (about £10). It is a measure of the bureaucrat’s art that almost all did sign, but the Georges declined.

Mr George grew up with a fine appreciation for the power of paperwork and the French legal system. Each week the family would switch their money into the best fund. “At the beginning I could send the document by fax, so it was really easy. Soon after they told me no, only by letter”, he said. To make sure nothing goes awry in the post, Mr George pays for a court appointed bailiff to deliver each set of instructions. The paper has piled up almost as fast as the money: “I would need to take one Boeing to bring all of the documents with me”, he said.

In 2002, Commercial Union took part in the merger of insurance companies which formed Aviva. Around that time legal cases began to appear as holdouts tried to assert their right to hindsight, represented by Nicolas Lecoq-Vallon, a lawyer who would later become celebrated in France for representing victims of the ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff. In 2005 Aviva told Les Echos around 30 holders of the magic contracts had taken legal action.

The family George won their first court judgement in 2007, which affirmed the validity of their contracts. A subsequent appeal court ruling went their way, as did a September 2014 ruling from the Cour de Cassation, France’s highest legal authority. According to Mr Lecoq-Vallon, “established case law exists and my office alone has constituted no fewer than 64 decisions which are unfavourable to Aviva”.

What remains a matter of continued litigation is the value of those contracts. An expert was appointed to assess the claims, and a Paris District court approved his findings, effectively that the families investments grew in value at 68.6 per cent a year for a decade from 1997. As of 2007 the family’s investments were worth €21m, with €1.4m belonging to Max-Hervé.

Mr George continues to arbitrage time. For instance, he might have his money in an Aviva fund invested in the French stock market. Lets say the Nikkei 225 rises 5 per cent during the week. He’ll tell Aviva to move his investments into its Japanese fund, at the price before the market moved.

So he is now in a strange position. Each week he grows his fortune by trading the past with precision, but cannot say how rich he is. “This report is until 2007, so what about 2007 to 2014?”, said Mr George. “The amount of the arbitrage is 100 per cent exactly, because I don’t know the amount of my contract.”



Estimating the size of his windfall is an illustration of exponential growth. Assume the growth rate of 68.6 per cent a year continues, and €1.4m becomes €93m. There was quite a significant market crash in 2008, but imagine you were able to pick the best performer each week as markets rebounded in 2009.

An appeal court, and potentially the Cour de Cassation, will still have the chance to settle the matter. Aviva said in a statement:

Aviva France strongly contests this compensation claim and believes that the Court will rule against the speculative and excessive compensation levels being sought.

Were Aviva not to prevail, the numbers become more significant every week the George’s bailiff arrives with instructions. Consider the effect of a liability growing at 68.6 per cent a year from here:



Mr George has also started to add fresh capital to the account governed by the contract, €19.9m last year, helped by a loan from the Swiss arm of a French Bank. (He is a French citizen, but lives in Switzerland). He said the contract terms allow him to add more cash to the pot. “I can take all the money in the world and invest it, there is no limit”.

Some policy holders may have died, but a handful of such cases would start to become a material number, even for an insurer of Aviva’s size, were court decisions to go against it. The company said “Aviva France remains appropriately reserved”. The absence of some plaintiffs from subsequent litigation suggests settlements were reached in some cases. Mr George’s father is no longer a claimant, for instance. The family declined to comment on the status of his policy.

His son claimed to be resolute, however. “With 64 decisions in favour the jurisprudence is a reality” he said. “After everything I just want to go for the maximum of justice. I don’t want money, I just want my contract.”

15-02-27,2xdcwl,New job with a more hands-on investment/retirement approach. I need help selecting plans.,"As the title says, I am starting a new job next week, and will be handling my retirement and investment funding manually. I previously worked as a professor, and had a TIAA-CREF account with a Vanguard Target Retirement 50 fund, and basically logged in a few times a year to check its progress. However, my new job allows us to select multiple plans. Since I am starting in the financial industry as a software developer, but have very little financial knowledge, I want to use this as an opportunity to learn about investing beyond throwing 10% of my salary into a black box.

[HERE is an album showing the available plans, with operating expenses.](http://imgur.com/a/yeINe)

Here is my background. I am 34 year man with a wife and 3 kids under 6. My old account has ~$25,000 in it after 1.5 years (only 50% vested).  We have no savings, no house, and $140,000 in student loan debt (these three things are all related...).

My salary is $160,000 ( pretty substantial increase), and my employer will match 50%, up to a total of $8000. I will also receive a minimum bonus of $20,000, and a signing bonus of $10,000.

So, my initial thought was to do 75% in something lower-risk like the same Vanguard 2050 plan, and 25% in higher risk. I liked the Ivy Science and Tech (WSTYX), but it has one of the higher expenses (1.24%), compared to the Vanguard (0.18%).

One additional question: on our info packet, it lists ""Administrative Expenses"" and says:

&gt; The Plan incurs expenses and fees for services... The fees are paid to the service providers. Any revenue derived from the Plan's investments are used to offset these expenses. Currently, the company is paying these fees, but may at any time elect to pay some or all of these Plan expenses from the Plan.

Do I interpret this to mean that I am not personally paying the listed Operating Expenses? Does this change which ones to invest in?

Also, we want to invest in college, and have a few 529 plans setup, but none currently with more than $7000 per kid. Any recommendations there?

Finally, what to do with the old 401(k)? Roll it over into the new plan, or setup an IRA?

Thanks! This is a great sub, and I have learned a ton already.",5

15-02-28,2xgj3j,TASR my assessment,"I purchased some TASR yesterday at 23.45 as it looked like the sell off had settled. The earnings per share was lower than expected but revenue was higher than expected. 

My thoughts on this were 

1. Their body camera/other video services were growing and I wouldn't be surprised if I'm the next few years police departments start to require these as it is already starting. 

2. They already have the distribution network and contracts with most government agencies / police departments. That gives them a small leg up to be selected for government contracts. 

3. Even with scrutiny of ""non-leathal"" devices of Tasers I don't for see them going away any time soon if anything I can see demand raise if they develop one that has lower risks associated with it. While regulation against them is possible I think the police unions would have a strong enough argument to keep them but just require more training /certification as they fulfill a unique role that had just been abused by some law enforcement.

I dumped the company at a 50% loss. I learned my lesson here. Stay away from companies early as an IPO. The company had an IPO last year. Now ive seen two class action lawsuits filed against them after this other news broke. Crazy how this all went down.

USAWX

USMIX

15-02-28,2xgxhe,Assumptions used by online retirement calculators,"Does anyone have any idea of the assumptions (and/or their source) used by online retirement calculators?  
  
The wild cards to a retirement calculation include:  
1) How much will tax rates go up?  
2) What will the inflation rate be?  
3) How much faster than inflation will medical costs go up?  
4) How much below inflation will the pre tax yields of safe investments be?  
5) How much (hopefully) above inflation will the pre tax yields of aggressive investments be?  
  
If you had plausible ranges on those unknowns plus someone's specific financial situation, and you are just marginally competent with Excel (or LibreOffice, which I prefer) you could make estimates far better than any of those online calculators, even better than a paid professional.  
  
I wouldn't easily believe any of the ""expert"" estimates of the above list of unknowns, but I'd still like to see them.  Unlike many other aspects of finance, I don't believe my personal guesses at those things is as good as the ""expert"" estimates.  
  
Someone I know is retired young with large but not extravagant savings.  She really has no clue whether she can afford the major vacations she wants to take.  Online or even expert advice looks at crude totals, differentiating such things as assets in retirement accounts vs. assets outside retirement accounts, but generally ignoring major factors, such as the lock between the cost basis of a non retirement asset and its unrealized income (you can't get back the cost basis from a stock or EE bond without realizing the capital gain or unrealized interest).  
  
The black box (again online or expert) answer makes hidden assumptions about those key questions and combines them with hidden failures to properly consider the available information to provide some bottom line answer or range of answers.  
  
The assumptions on the key questions would be barely worthy of some trust if revealed.  When hidden, those assumptions make the final answer worthless.

Broke longterm 2.6 resistance which is the reason why it is so open to a morning spike. Also has late day buying, shaping out to be a great morning spike buy past 3 (i was wrong)

Fro is up on a cnbc report up 50 cents/share which is pretty insane. There is a breakout above 3 and if it can hold up then it would be a nice buy for a 50/cent gain. This stock also squeezed a lot. Likely a good momentum buy in the morning. 

Cbmx looks like a good short if it cant break 1.6, if it does than its a pretty good momentum buy if it continues

15-02-28,2xh1se,How will Total Bond Market Index funds/rates be affected over the next 5 years?,"My understanding is that after 2009, the monetary policies of the Fed made investing in a Total Bond Market Index fund (example: Vanguard VBMFX) better that normal. That is, an investment of $10,000 from 2005 to 2009 would have grown +$1,200 - and over a period of 2009 to 2013 grows +$3,500 to $4,000

However, because of the economy recovering and seemingly doing well, the Fed is going to slowly revert back to it's previous (pre-2009) type policies. I'm using general terms re: policy because I definitely don't understand all that the Fed is doing, if someone has an easy way to explain...by all means.

My questions:

1. How will this affect current Total Bond Market Index holdings?

2. How will this affect future Total Bond Market Index purchases?

Will it simply mean less growth overall for both?",2

This is not necessarily a small feat as websites change, and there are no clear identifiers etc, it would be a lot easier to just download the annual reports already compiled into txt, csv or whatever format.

15-02-28,2xhlvr,How to sell / convert old QTRN (Quintiles Transnational) shares?,"Be gentle, this is my first post.

Some time ago my wife was involved in a ESPP via etrade.  We regarded the shares she purchased as a long term investment.

So we didn't keep up with the account very well after she found a different position.

I logged into the account for tax stuff, and remembered the shares and went and looked at the ESPP.  It shows the shares but we can't sell them, since Quintiles is no longer listed under *QTRN*, but under *Q* now.  

Here's the upshot:

&gt; Quintiles Transnational (*QTRN*) Shares purchased
&gt; 
&gt; 09/30/2000	$12.00625	24	
&gt; 12/31/2000	$13.546875	26	
&gt; 03/31/2001	$16.04375	23	
&gt; 06/30/2001	$16.04375	7	
&gt; 
&gt; 2003 - Quintiles goes private  (I never knew about this, my wife had left by this time)

&gt; 2013 - Quintiles goes public again under symbol *Q*

Is there a way I can convert these *QTRN* shares to *Q*?

Are these QTRN shares worth anything anymore?  I imagine it's going to be hard to find a buyer for nonexistent stock...",2
15-02-28,2xhn3c,Finally adding fixed products to my portfolio - best ways for my style/situation?,"I'm high risk appetite / very passive.  My portfolio was ~$60k between Roth, 401k and brokerage.  **All** equity ETFs (MFs in 401k).  ACAT'd in $45k in equities from an custodial a/c I was the BNF of to my brokerage.  Added $5k to get Fidelity's 60 free trades promotion - liquidated majority of positions on the equities (all long term gains) - and now have a ton of flexibility.  


What are some good strategies to incorporated fixed?  I've been told cash is strong and a high yield savings a/c - even at current rates - is better than getting into fixed, the liquidity and the such.  This now sounds *too* aggressive ever since I've came into the $45k.



* Move funds from brokerage to Roth (maybe even max out - $3.5k to go) and go in on HYG?  Appears slightly sexier than AGG from an income perspective.  
* Look into Int'l Corp/Govt's? 
* Go w/ tax-free munis in the brokerage (those free trades, only applicable to trxns w/in the brokerage)
* remain hardcore and leave excess cash in savings?
* whacky high-yield CDs?  

This would all be buy/hold, in accordance w/ how I treat my all equity funds.  My taxable income for '15 should be in in the low 90's if that helps w/ the decision where to allocate high dividend fixed funds/products.

15-02-28,2xi41h,UBS Study: Much better than risk parity- Sharpe parity,"&gt; As an alternative to risk parity we consider Sharpe parity. This is a portfolio in which the **weight is proportional to the Sharpe ratio of each asset**. Think about it this way: if asset X has a Sharpe ratio of 2 it means that we have two units of return for a unit of risk, while asset Y with a Sharpe ratio of 1 gives us only one unit of return for the same amount of risk. In that case we construct a portfolio with the weight for asset X being the double of the weight of asset Y. You can also think about it as having the same risk premium for each asset class.

&gt;We start by running the strategy and show that in terms of absolute returns it outperforms not only risk parity but also a vast range of other strategies such as minimum variance and max Sharpe. We also show that this strategy provides some protection against risk (i) because it makes use of all asset classes instead of concentrating investment in a few low-volatility fixed income assets as is typical of risk parity and (ii) because back-testing shows that the drawdown with our strategy is limited. Only the minimum variance strategy outperforms in terms of drawdown, but Sharpe parity is the fastest to recoup losses following a drawdown.
