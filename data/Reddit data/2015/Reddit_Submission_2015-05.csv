15-05-01,34h0ps,"Thinking about pitching a high yield, high risk investment idea - avenues where to do so?","Hey everyone,

I'm a former professional poker player that has recently moved into the marketing and advertising world to pursue a more predictable and less stressful lifestyle.

Within the professional poker world, it is common for players to form relationship with other players for poker staking and investing relationships, where a staker will put a 'horse' into the game with a pre arranged agreement of the staker getting a percentage of the profits. The horse agrees to take a lower percentage of his own profits in exchange for reducing or eliminating his risk and liability, essentially allowing the player to play optimally without the added stress of worrying about a bad month causing him to lose his monthly rent payment.

I formed various financial relationships over years of playing with investors, but invariably the investors were small time players who didn't understand (as much as I tried to stress the nature of the game) the volatility of poker. They expected their investment to basically be a free money tree, with them receiving a few grand a month while never contemplating the consequences of players having a bad month.

I'm currently looking for advice on both venues and strategies for attempting to pitch the idea of poker investing to people who a) have money to invest and b) understand the volatility involved in a high risk investment like this. I have been involved in the poker world for so long (roughly 6 years) where I am somewhat desensitized to outside perceptions of gambling, and invariably whenever I speak to someone about investing, it's almost like two different worlds in terms of what their expectations are and what the reality of the situation is.

Also, in terms of structuring a deal with people who are actually familiar with investing, how appealing (or unappealing) does this setup sound:

A general funding goal of $6,000, where investors may purchase any amount of shares at $100/share. Of the total profits made from each week, 40% of the profits will go directly to the player. The remaining 60% will be split up among investors, depending on the amount of shares owned. In the event of the fund ending down one week, the fund will continue to roll until it reaches its $6,000 once again, then profit splitting would resume as normal.

If I pitched this at an expected average gain of $400/week (based on previous winnings, and including both losing weeks and winning weeks), would that be something an enticing investment given the high risk involved? 

I feel the biggest obstacles are verification and public perceptions of gambling. Is there a way to present this as a sound investment (albeit risky) that could entice potential investors?",0

While I understand that this sale as a transaction itself doesn't indicate insider trading, it just seems like if the stock dropped even a couple dollars tomorrow the CEO would be at risk for a ton of allegations. Also wouldn't this sale indicate to investors that the price the CEO received was considered to be close to the ceiling of the share price of the company leading to other problems?

How common are huge executive sells like this? How likely is it that the CEO just needs to liquefy some of his executive compensation options and that this sell means nothing other than that?

15-05-01,34h6fz,lnkd (LinkedIn) huge potential and good stock buy?,"disclaimer: i am no professional and have no real qualifications to make a worthy bases for a buy. Just someone with a hypothesis.
anyway.
I feel as though LinkedIn will be the next largest social boom. With the first wave of young people to use facebook are going to college and hitting the work force I see LinkedIn as being the new way for young buisness men and women to show off to their friends how they are doing in the buisness world. And that facebook will be seen as a ""childish"" way of communicating. With this new wave of tech savy people hitting the work force but also on the internet most of the time, it seems only logical that LinkindIn will see a huge boom in users as those who started with facebook will more to linked in to show off to their friends how they are doing in their working lives. 
My question: do you agree, and do you feel now is a good time to buy Lnkd or do they have such bad fanancials that even though they will see an increase in users it wont matter as they are so bad. 
Tldr; lnkd has huge potential as the kids who used to use facebook are now working and will soon switch over to lnkd to show off to their friends.   ",5

15-05-01,34jf0i,Owner Financing Proposition that I received,"So, I've already turned this down, and it sounds like the shadiest deal I've ever been offered, but I wanted to swing by here and see if anyone has ever heard of something like this.

I received a phone call from someone who knew I was looking into selling my house.

We'll use the name Sam as a placeholder for the real name.  Sam indicated interest in purchasing my house without a realtor.  6% is a large percent for someone helping you sell a house, so I was obviously somewhat interested in the proposition.  We agreed to meet at a local coffee shop.

Sam proposed making me a lender to a (emphasis on tax paying) foreign national who can't get a loan from a bank.  Sam referred me to a lawyer that would help answer my questions and get the ball rolling.  

I was extremely turned off by this situation, and it sounds terrifically shady.  I'm mostly coming here to ask, am I wrong for being extremely skeptical of this deal?  This sounds like someone trying to scam me out of my house and sticking me with the mortgage.

I appreciate any insight anyone can give me.

15-05-01,34j0fu,All I-bonds issued in the last 13 years paying no interest for next 6 months.,"Bad news for I-bonds holders. Deflation means that you probably won't be getting any interest for the next 6 months. Not unless you bought I-bonds before 2002.

I-bonds rates are set by factors: a fixed rate which is set when the bond is issued and does not change for the life of the bond, and a variable rate which changes with the CPI-U.

As of today, May 1st, the new variable rate for I-bonds is -0.8%. The fixed rate remains at 0%. This means that all I-bonds issued in the last 13 years are now paying 0% for the next six months (until a new variable rate is set).

Take a look during the shutdown of the US federal government it XIV shot down to low 25 and rebounded back up to 30+ in a few weeks.

15-05-01,34jp21,Challenging Conventional Investment Management Theory,"What exactly is the goal of investing? 

The very first thought that comes to mind is to make money. People invest in the market to make a return on capital invested. This, I have no problem with. However, the goals set in pursuit of this, and the strategies employed in this are what make absolutely no sense to me.

Think about what is taught in conventional financial theory and investment management. The number one goal in investment analysis and management is to not only make money, but to beat the market. Managers execute daily trades and attempt to time the market to complete this very objective. However, when I really think about it makes no sense to me, or FOR me. There seems to be this huge focus on beating the market performance. Sometimes I question whether or not that REALLY matters.

My theory is this…

If you set a dollar amount to have by a certain age, say $1mm by age 45, then you could actually calculate, based on a certain discount rate, how much you need to invest per period to meet your goal. If this is the case, then why do portfolio managers break their back every day, executing trades daily, dangerously trying to time the market? Why not just specify to clients every quarter whether or not they hit their goal for the quarter, and how much they are above/below target or on track by?

Wouldn’t it be much more responsible to set a goal financially and work towards it slowly instead of focusing on market performance in terms of benchmarking?

**EDIT:** Here is a more detailed example of what I mean for those interested.

I’m currently 22 years old. Let’s imagine I have an objective to have $1mm by age 40 and want to achieve this result by aiming to achieve an 8% return per year. I have a balance of $3,000 right now. Lets say I contribute $X per year to achieve this result (I’m not doing the math because I’m lazy. If someone does the math I’ll add the real number but I don’t see the point).

Under conventional portfolio management technique, the fund managers would invest in the equities/assets that they believe will yield me my desired return. They would have down quarters as well as up quarters and would hope over-time to perform well enough to hit my goal.

However, a new and probably unpopular method would be to achieve the desired return, and then exit the market after hitting the performance goal. This would in effect cap gains and limit losses, but the end result is that the long term goal of $1mm by 40 would have been achieved while avoiding significant fluctuation in terms of where the fund is in relation to the goal.

This is again, un-conventional but I would be interested in hearing thoughts about this investment style.

Undoubtedly, his new valuation will be even higher than his [February 11th $216/share figure](http://www.shareholderssquaretable.com/letter-to-twitter-followers-regarding-apple/).

Quick Results:

* Steady-State Value (SSV) = **$878.5 Billion**

* Future Value Creation (FVC) = **600.6 Billion**

* Final Valuation: **$1.479 Trillion**, or roughly **$225.50/share**

* Steady-State Value (SSV): **$996.56 Billion**

* Future Value Creation (FVC): **$578.83 Billion**

(25yo BTW)

I have seen ETF portfolios with just large value, utility, and telecommunications ETF's netting an easy 3 and some percent yield, while remaining less volatile than the market as a whole, but I was wondering if funds like First Trust Diversified Multi-Asset Income Fund (MDIV) and the iShares Morningstar Multi-Asset Income Fund (IYLD) could be a good replacement for my portfolio entirely, seeing as they consist of other ETF funds which I don't see going away anytime soon.

Expense Ratio of both funds is around .6%, but on contrast they also yield a healthy dividend of around 6% for both of them.

So could it be trusted to construct a taxable portfolio of just a good solid Multi-Asset Income fund? Some do the same with Target Date funds so I don't see why this would be too much different. The taxes on the dividends would be the same as the equity funds I've seen, so 15% after a year.

I have a separate Roth IRA which I plan to max out ($5500) for the year.

15-05-02,34lpjk,Noob here. Bought 12 stocks in Yelp today at $39.39. I plan on sitting on it for a while but I would like to see your opinion on this move.,"So today was my first time putting money down on a stock. I have a few friends that I work with who have done a little bit of investing in a few stocks and have been successful with it over the past year. One of my friends had been watching yelp for a while and decided that after the drop from the other day that buying it at under $40 a share would be a good move and to sit on it for the rest of the quarter to see where it moves. Obviously I am hoping for an uptrend but I am feeling a bit of buyers remorse.

My initial thoughts were that Yelp is a fairly large company with a loyal user base which is growing. Yelp makes money off of promoting businesses on local search queries and is constantly expanding in their existing markets and moving into new ones as well. Their earnings report wasn't great but not necessarily anything to  cause any major concern. There have been reports about shady business practices when it comes to interaction with the business owners and their sales reps which makes their promotions a harder sell but ultimately it is a reliable way to bring in customers and revenue for local businesses.

I personally think that Yelp won't bottom out and even if it did its only 500 bucks. I would like someone with more experience to give me their opinion on the move. 

If the stock swings back up to where it was at in the next few months I can potentially make 100 bucks off the investment. Is my reasoning solid or am I out of my depth so far?

I do plan on getting into AAPL for a few thousand next week if the market trends lower than what it closed at this week. If not I will hold out on it until its around $110 a share. 

Thanks in advance for the conversation!


**EDIT:** Posted an update down below. Thanks for the input everyone! It ended up turning out in my favor so my gamble paid off. I will probably post more in /r/wallstreetbets but I also want to have these conversations here so I can get opinions outside of ""YOLOing on DGLY!!! Get in now!!!"" sort of things haha. What I wanted to see was people pointing out the holes in my logic. I'm just starting out so I am going to continue doing some high risk buyins around 500 bucks but the advice I am getting will suit me down the road when I choose some more long term investments.

Thanks again everyone!

15-05-03,34pdr0,Apple Watch Sales Failure?,"**It was bound to happen**: forecasts of poor sales of Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AAPL) new smartwatch early on after is launch. This is according to a preeminent observer of Apple numbers. The negative comments came from wildly regarded UBS analyst Steve Milunovich. If he is correct, Apple faces its first trouble in a very long time

Milunovich said:

&gt; Apple has somewhat botched the Watch introduction. First “early” in the year was defined to include April. Then supply issues pushed back availability for most early buyers. The buzz has been reduced by requiring appointments and by the inability for now to take Watches home from Apple stores. However, Apple is right to go slowly as the Watch represents a new category. Word of mouth will be important, so training users is needed.



The last time an important Wall Street analyst used the word “botched” regarding Apple is beyond remembering. Milunovich’s pessimism may not be long-lived. He wrote that Apple Watch was in the early part of what will be a long development curve. He also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $150. Since Apple shares recently traded at an all-time high, just above $134, Milunovich’s Buy rating is modest praise.

Among the primary questions about Apple’s next few quarters is whether a surge in iPhone sales will continue, which would eclipse almost any disappointment in Apple Watch sales. Apple’s management has said the greater China market will soon represent the largest among all markets, passing the Americas. Greater China revenue last quarter was $16.8 billion. Revenue from the Americas was $21.3 billion, out of $58 billion. Should Greater China sales pass those of the Americas in the next quarter, almost any stumble on Apple Watch will be forgiven.

Apple Watch early results, if Milunovich is correct, could mean that wearable devices, particularly smartwatches, have come to market too soon. That could be the first result of a product launch to take Apple’s share price down, and down fairly hard.

15-05-03,34onob,FCAU - The end of a brilliant run?,"Fiat Chrysler Autos has performed brilliantly since its IPO back in mid October 2014. Starting from 8.92, it climbed to 16.72 in mid March. Instead of taking my gains and getting it out, I got greedy and held on. Since mid March, the stock has been moving sideways until late April, when earnings were released. Despite a good result, the CEO made a statement about global consolidation of auto companies. The stock took a 15% nosedive over three days. Brutal.

I get that Technical Analysis is mocked in this sub, but given the parabola-like shape of the chart since October, is now a good time to get out? The company seems healthy and solid aside from the CEOs comments.

Having stupidly sold during a dip of a different stock, I am cautious about panicking early, but FCAU is my heaviest position (~ 25%) and it's tempting to cut losses and get out before the gains turn to losses.

15-05-03,34pvrk,Investment opportunity in ecommerce seems too good to be true? Please help!,"Let me preface this by saying I have never invested in anything before, so I am kind of walking in the dark. Also, posting this on mobile so I apologise for any mistakes. 


A person I know well and work with came to me with an opportunity to invest in a ecommerce business. The place we work I work for offers both financial and customer service resolutions ( read CB handlings and call centres ) for online businesses. Majority of the companies we deal with are fad diet/supplement/weight loss programs that have trial offers and reoccurring payments. The opportunity is to become a IBO( merchant account holder? ) of X amount ( depending on credit score ) for one such company. The way I was explained it was that these companies deal mainly through high risk merchant accounts, so in order to reduce the amount of charge backs and not get TMF'd they split the transactions between multiple smaller merchant accounts that feed in to one MID rather than having one large MID for let's say 500k. 

Because banks only allow a x% of charge backs per merchant account having multiple smaller merchant accounts reduces this risk of going past the % threshold. 


If I were to agree to this, they would open up a merchant account in my name ( I would be the account holder ) which then the bank in accordance to my credit would allow them to make transactions up to x amount of dollars. For every confirmed sale ( read profit ) they make under my merchant account, I would then at the end of the month make a cut of ( 2%-5% not yet negotiated). Their accounting department would handle all the paperwork. He would pay for the set up fees of the merchant account and setting up my LLC/Inc ( he said it costs something around $1500) and at the end of the year I would receive a 10-99. 

According to him, if worst case scenario the merchant account gets TMF'd ( terminated merchant account due to too many charge backs etc ) the only thing that happens is my name is TMF'd ( I can't sell anything online of hold a merchant account ..whoopdie doo) but it does not effect my credit, I don't owe any money, and I am not held liable really. 


This sounds way good to be true. If this is the case why doesn't EVERYONE do this? Making money for NOTHING literally nothing but signing a couple documents. What are the risks involved that I am not being told ? Whenever I research this under any of the contractual jargon I get results of Amway and as a child of the 90's that sends a huge red flag in my head! But this is also setting up his own daughter ( who just turned 18 ) to do this... So if there was a huge risk why run the risk of messing up his daughters stuff ? He is more than well off ( black Amex well off ) it's hard to believe it's a scam, but it also sounds too good to be true, so I turn to you!!

I figure this would be useful for Canadians and Europeans as well, but I can't find anywhere that offers this as an option (Google chart's allows you to 'set a currency' but I'm not sure what, if anything, that actually does).

My question: if you buy some options for a stock, do you have to have the money in your brokerage account to exercise that option? (I believe that's the correct terminology). What if you plan on buying the underlying asset then immediately selling? 


For example, say I buy 100 options for a stock today at $10/share. In a month its $15. That means I could buy 10k shares of that stock for $10/share, or $100k, right? But that stock would be worth $150k. Do I need to have that $100k in order to make the $50k, or can I do some sort of execute then sell immediately?


And if anyone has a good recommendation for books to read on this, I'd be happy to hear about them. Thanks!",6

For the post-tax investing, I'm about to bring a healthy chunk of post-tax cash due to some investments and commissions coming in and I'm going to re-balance my investments. I'd like to keep a cash stake available so that I can take advantage of business or investment opportunities. Right now, most of my post-tax investments are committed and I don't want to withdraw any and trigger a tax event on them, and with the cash coming in, there's no need.

My question is what percentage of cash position is considered normal for pure-investment mixes (not retirement, personal finances, as they are covered) so that I have the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities when they come? Naturally, cash positions are not participating in the market, which protects it from downturn, but inflation--which has been deceptively tame lately--can mean that it could end up with a negative return over time. Yet, if something good comes along that I want to invest in, I don't have enough flexibility if it's all committed.

15-05-04,34sz4l,How do REITs make money?,"Let us suppose that company XYZ is a publicly traded REIT. 
It raised a certain amount of money by doing an IPO. It took all that money and bought income producing real estate. 
Now, as far as I know, XYZ is required to distribute up to 90% of its income from the real estate it just bought to its shareholders. So how does XYZ get more money to expand and buy more real estate?
Is taking loans the only option to raise more money and expand? Or does it have to make do with the remaining 10% income that it retains? If it raises debt to expand, how does it pay down that debt if it has to pass along 90% of its income?

15-05-04,34rwfz,(NJ-NYC metro) Help Verifying Investment Firm Securities Fraud,"[As you can obviously tell from my account, I also posted in r/legaladvice. In retrospect, I should have posted here 1st to verify this is fraud, though my current advisor said it definitely is. What does r/investing think?]

I began investing with this investment firm when I switched jobs Aug 2008 and needed to reinvest my 401k. I actually bought into the US bubble theories and looked for a company that did direct overseas stock investing. I got a good bounce because of the timing to the recession, but I always suspected an issue because the portfolio interface and statements never showed more that OTC pink sheets. This was always dismissed by the firm reps as an artifact of the unusual trading platform. Still, when my wife changed jobs later, I also moved her 401k to this firm. The assigned investment advisor had been horrible on communications and actually following through with providing advice, recommendations, or changes unless it was caused by apparent firm-wide scripts that I received every once in a while.
Fast forward to last month, I was finally ready to switch brokers to a local franchise brokerage that family have been happy with. I was going to close out my positions at my current brokerage and have the cash moved until the new brokerage recommended simply moving the assets over (apparently a standard process).
This is when things got interesting: both my wife and I began receiving multiple calls and emails from the original brokerage's CEO himself warning of impending doom on our account value if we didn't stop the transfer. No exaggeration, the call I finally took from him lasted an hour, with 30 mins filled by him talking one-sided as I laid the phone on my desk and checked email. He convinced me to ""rescind"" the requests and execute sales through his firm 1st to save ""market maker"" losses, however, my wife's account already transferred by this point and the new broker said there was nothing but OTC stocks in the fund. If they were telling the truth, this would mean they would have had to sell the local market shares without my consent, then purchase OTC shares without my consent prior to transferring.
Second piece of evidence came from my account, which he did manage to keep and sell the ""foreign stocks"" in. I went through the sales records meticulously and noticed that every sale matched the OTC market prices, including price gaps (some are only updated weekly), indicated that they could not have been sold on the foreign exchanges and records converted since price by order quantity were not skewed from OTC markets. I confronted them about this and the previous evidence and was told they would provide the back office sales records: this was a week ago.
TL;DR Investment firm purporting to purchase foreign stocks just buying OTC and charging extra for nothing.",0

15-05-04,34tu22,Warrants - Can someone confirm I am understanding them right?,"I read the Wikipedia page, and watched a few videos, and read some articles, and this is my understanding: Warrants are issued by the company.  When you buy a warrant at X price, it allows you to continue to buy stock from the company at X price until a set date.  So it kind of acts like equity/stock options if you worked for the company.

Is that correct?  If not, is someone able to help me understand a better answer?

I do have some questions about it though, which I haven't been able to find.  If it helps, I am looking at TACOW

1. I am a current shareholder in TACO, does that matter in any significant way if I want to buy TACOW?

2. When I buy the warrant, I assume that means I can only buy TACOW for the set price, and not TACO, correct?

3.  How much do I need to invest to be eligible for a warrant.  Can I theoretically buy 1 TACOW now, and then worry about buying the rest later at the set price?

Any information to help me understand will be much appreciated!

*Below is a summary of how I became interested in finance and how I taught myself how to actively trade… I’m very curious how many of you relate to my experiences because I rarely meet that many people who I can, or care for that matter, to reciprocate a conversation about investing.

        I am about to start my first full-time career making under $50k and will finally have enough discretionary income to invest. I am about to graduate--having taken no formal courses in finance--however the past several years I have taken it upon myself to teach myself investments finance in my free time, hoping to become a financially competent/responsible individual. 
       I developed a fundamental understanding of basic finance principles and terminology using Investopedia.com.  After which I read books including The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham, Beating the Street by Peter Lynch, and other lesser known books about investment strategies and several on technical trend analysis. 
       I began actively trading using Investopedia’s free simulator and unintentionally developed somewhat of an obsession after I began to see some returns on the short term/swing trading investments I had been making. Two years later I am sitting at a little over 45% annual returns. I am aware of the controversy involved with swing trading and also that simulators are missing the “emotion factor.”  Before I pursue a career in financial services I intend to develop my sales skills in my current career, continuing to study finance on the side. Any advice on the title question or preparing for a career in financial services is welcomed and greatly appreciated, tank you preeze!

TL;DR- I taught myself how to tradez and practiced on a simulator. Saw substantial returnz. Looking to do it for realz. Need halp and advices. Tank you preeze!

My hope is to capture one of these big moves like in oct-jan when it gained 30%. That would be about $19k for me.

So far down $2k on the combo, but I think things will get better. The treasury component TMF is off considerably from the highs and is due  for a bounce at some point.

I have $1,800 to invest in *something*, and because I'm new to the stock market, would like some advice for what would be best for me. 

What I really want to do is invest in about 5-10 different stocks that offer dividends, and reinvest those earnings as often as I can. I understand that mutual funds can do that for you, but I don't know whether that will bring me in more money on payouts, or if I would be better off running solo. On a related note to dividends, could somebody clarify to me exactly how they work? My understanding is that companies will return leftover money from investments to shareholders at various time intervals depending on the company. 

Before my financial situation gets questioned, I have my first semester of college paid for (going to a technical college), I have enough money to pay for several monthS of rent ($500/MO and electric, cellphone, food, etc) saved up ASIDE from the $1800 I'm investing.

I want to get exposure to countries like India, Brazil, and possibly Russia (with a smattering of several others from Africa and se Asia). I've heard and found good things about equities being undervalued in these countries, and I think they're getting to a point as a society where a doomsday scenario is unlikely. In other words, I think the risk return ratio is satisfactory to me. 
That said, the only funds I can find through vanguard have very large positions in China (roughly 23%) which worries me. Mostly this is because I don't know much about China's economy, but have heard murmurs about Chinese companies falsifying/embellishing earnings reports, deliberate inflation of the market by the government, and generally unsustainable activity. Oddly, the other countries don't worry me as much even though I recognize that they may have even greater flaws that I'm ignorant of.
Basically, I'm looking for someone to give me some perspective on China, and what's going on over there. I get that it makes sense to diversify globally in such a large powerhouse of a country, but I'd just as soon have that 23% in any other country since I understand those better. ",6

What's wrong with the idea of cashing in on these IVs for a month?

I have now opened an account with OptionsXpress (Charles Schwab) and I'm deciding how to best structure my portfolio. I have read about the 3/4 fund / Couch Potatoe portfolios etc. however I still have some queries in relation to these.

In the book I've read, it was advised to structure a portfolio similarly to the following - 

* 35% European bonds (**IBGS**)
* 40% Global stocks (**VWRD**) (or is it **VWRL?**)
* 25% European stocks (**IMEU** or **VEUR**)

Given current market conditions, am I better off to lower this Bond allocation? I have heard some people allocate their age as their bond allocation, but this may not be advised given low interest rates etc.? Are there better alternatives to the above funds?

Finally, should I be looking for Schwab equivlents of the above funds as I own a Schwab account? If so, what's the best approach to do this?

Greatly appreciate any feedback/advice. Thanks

15-05-05,34x1ln,"Naspers -- sum-of-the-parts looks pretty good. Lots of moving parts here, what do you think?","Somebody mentioned Naspers in this sub in passing and I decided to have a look at them. I know they have a great track record of investing in non-American internet companies and largely leaving them alone. Tencent (China) has been their biggest hit by far. But they have stakes in some other very promising companies including Flipkart and Souq.com, along with their core operations.

I found this well written article that breaks down the sum-of-the-parts math. 

http://seekingalpha.com/article/2954686-naspers-the-best-asset-manager-in-the-media-and-internet-services-space

The prices have changed a bit since that was written, so I've updated them:

Non-core business assets:

* Tencent stake: $64.98 billion
* Mail.ru stake $707.7 million
* Abril stake: I can't find anything resembling a value on this. All I know is that they own 30%. As of 2012 the company employed 5,500 and had profit of $400 million on revenue of $5.5 billion. Surely there is a comparable public company to get a value from? But Something like 4-10 P/E sounds right. So $1.6 billion on the low end, with no growth factored in. So $480 million for our stake seems very reasonable. 
* Flipkart is raising at a $15 billion valuation. Naspers has an 18% stake. $2.7 billion.
* souq.com: $500 million valuation, own 48%: $240 million
* cash minus debt: -$776.5 million (somebody please double check this, i might be wrong)

Valuation: $68.331 billion

NPSNY Market Cap: $64.75

So you get paid $3.5 billion and change to take everything else. Put another way, you pay for Tencent and you (basically) get everything else for free.

-Countless other internet investments of early, little and late stage firms. They basically operate as a venture capital or private equity firm, investing in stuff all over the developing World.

-And you get their core business, however unattractive it may be. It appears to be profitable. They have a Pay TV devision, a print media division and an e-commerce division, I believe all focusing on Africa, that together could be worth $20 billion or more, according to the article above (I did no due diligence on these assets).

Smells a lot like YHOO, in that the other assets are driving the price. However if they spun off or sold off the Tencent stake, the market would have to grapple with placing a value on the core and everything else. And it seems very unlikely that value would be a negative amount.

A lot of currency risk here. With ZAR and HKD. You're also doing business in Africa, which to mean just seems a little crazy.

So that's my thesis. Haven't bought any shares yet. 

Thoughts?

As you can imagine, it was a massive windfall and I ended up selling with a new account balance of 13.5k.  Now I am perfectly clear on how stupid lucky I was, but I did see this as an opportunity to learn day/short hold trading, and my personal rule is to stop if I end up back at 12k. So far I've averaged a 1.77% gain on my trades, but with trade fees, I'm at 13,450. I guess I could be doing a lot worse, at least.  

I'm in college for business and economics and have a pretty light courseload (3 classes). So far I'm trading in my downtime (and biology, fuck that class), and I'll be able to devote 5 hours a day into the foreseeable future, so I've got the time needed.

Anyway, my mom is friends with a successful day trader who retired recently. He's offered to meet with me and answer any questions I have. I'm considering asking him if he could be a kind of coach, and I'd buy him lunch once a week or something to pick his brain for ideas, advice, and feedback on my weeks trades. Do y'all think it would be worth it? I feel like advice from an experienced trader would be worth its weight in gold, but I could be wrong.  So far I've just been reading stuff online and talking to my professors but none of them have ever traded.  I'm just looking to learn in the best way possible.

15-05-05,34wcct,"A case for ""day""-trading (casual trading/investing)","I've seen people get a lot of crap for day-trading, especially if they are newbies.  Maybe it is because this is /r/investing and not /r/daytrading where majority of us are passive investors where the money is put in some ETF/MF/Vanguard/others/etc and left there to grow over time and contribution is made periodically to help compound the growth.

I'd like to make a case for casual trading where you do trade more frequently than a buy &amp; forget investor, including equities and derivatives, but not nearly as frequently as a day-trader that makes several trades a day every trading day.

I've been casually trading for 10 years where I went through the euphoria and the recession, made and lost a ton of money.  When I started, I was discouraged like many others here but I kept at it, trying everything from commodities to f/x to ETFs to stocks.  Took me about 8 years to finally lay the foundations of the ground rules that I follow for more successful results.  [You can see how I've fared in the last 2.5 years when I started tracking the results.](http://i.imgur.com/PtiaV9q.png)  *Unless otherwise mentioned, there were NO additional deposits made to the portfolio during this period.*

The point I'm trying to make is simply this - all the rules/adages of wall street and the market notwithstanding, casual trading IS a viable way of making money, but like ~~all~~ **many** other ventures, it has a high failure rate (considering the higher risk/reward ratio), requires a huge learning curve and discipline.

What I like about casual trading/investing is that you don't need a lot of capital start off with.  However, like with any activity, you need to start at some point and get your feet wet.  Success may not be guaranteed since one can't see the future, but there is no other way to learn and improve.  Yes, that means taking some losses too but I believe the potential is worth it.  This **isn't** a humble-brag to show how I'm beating the market, but just to show it is possible and can be learned.

About me: 30 year old with a finance/math background. I only deal with stocks and options of particular companies (i.e. no ETFs/commodities/funds/etc).  I trade and invest somewhat infrequently with short to long-term outlook.  I like this approach because I don't need to sit in front of the computer all the time and only check in from time to time.  This isn't conventional day-trading nor is it long-term investing.  I don't have a proper term for but I suppose you can call it casual or lifestyle trading.  I have developed my investment ground-rules/philosophy/style that I use to invest and trade, *and if you guys are interested then I can elaborate further.*

**tl;dr** - ""day""-trading is a viable way to make money, it takes time and experience but it can be learned.

**PS:** While this isn't for everyone, if people are interested in learning my trading methodology/style, then I would like to create something (short ebooks/excel tools/blog with articles/youtube videos/podcast).  Feel free to advise or give me any input as to what would work best.",14
15-05-05,34wd0s,How to Identify the Short Term Market Peak,"For short term investors and traders, it’s crucial to recognize the short term market peak when it happens.  I’ve already discussed the characteristics of long term, multi-year bull market peaks. This time we’re looking at short term peaks (that are not new all time highs) and their characteristics to help you maximize returns on your private investments.

 

Define a Short Term Market Peak

Before we identify the common characteristics of a short term market peak, we must first define this term. Here’s an example – GDX, the gold miner’s ETF:

 Multiple Resistance
Multiple Resistance
No New All Time High

As you can see from the chart above, this type of short term market peak is not near an all-time high. Rather, the market has fallen for a while, and this is the short term market peak during one of the waves in a subsequent uptrend.

Time Frame

The “wave” lasts just a few months – anything longer than 4 months, and this is not considered to be a “short term” market peak.

The Above Example

As you can see the chart for GDX (gold miners ETF) above, GDX has fallen for almost a year now (which coincides with the decline in gold and silver). Only recently has GDX moved off of its lows. This fits in perfectly with the “short term” market peak concept. GDX is nowhere near an all time high (in fact, it GDX just hit bottom), and this recent wave has only lasted over a month.

Identify the Peak

When you make short term investment decisions, you absolutely have to use technical analysis. However, the problem is that there are many technical indicators. In the event that these indicators are sending mixed signals, which one should you use? Which one is more important and can override the others? I honestly don’t know.

HOWEVER, I do know that when all the technical indicators align and point towards one direction, the probably of that happening greatly increases. If all my technical indicators send out a clear SELL signal, then the odds of the market falling is very likely.

Regarding short term market peaks, 4 things will send a clear SELL signal when they all happen at the same time:

Major resistance.
Heavy volume.
Intraday bloodbath.
Connections between markets.
Major Resistance

Markets will often peak at a price that was a massive historical resistance point. If you look at the GDX chart below, you’d notice that GDX failed to break through this resistance barrier multiple times in the past 6 months. Thus, the fact that GDX is right below this resistance level today means that it will likely fail to break this resistance (again). This sends a major warning sign that the short term peak is in.

 Multiple resistances, + the recent massive red bar
Multiple resistances, + the recent massive red bar
Heavy Volume

A lot of traders like to look at volume – I don’t really know why. They believe that volume sends a lot of clear signs – personally, I can’t seem to make volume work to my advantage.

However, volume is really useful when the market faces a major resistance and promptly falls. Such a decline in market price combined with heavy selling means that the market is very weak. Thus, a clear warning sign that the market might peak is sent.

Massive Red Intraday Bar

If the market falls really hard one day without any meaningful support, it will create a massive red intraday bar. This means that the market is really, really weak because there is virtually no support. Coupled with heavy volume, this sends a clear sign that the bears vastly overpower the bulls.

Connections Between Markets

I don’t just look at one market – I look at 8 markets. I look at multiple U.S. stock indexes (Russell, S&amp;P500, NASDAQ), multiple commodity markets (gold, silver, copper, oil), and currencies (primarily the EURO/USD pair). Why?

Because markets are highly correlated nowadays, what happens in one market will affect other markets. For example, I recently believe that the short term peak for stocks is in. Thus, stock prices will fall. When stock prices will fall, it will likely drag down gold and GDX (gold miners) prices with them.

Summary

When the following three things happen at the same time, it is very, very likely that the short term market peak is in:

A massive red intraday bar.
Heavy volume – this is the only time when volume is useful.
A massive resistance line that has stopped the market on multiple occasions.
Other markets are falling, dragging down this market with it.",1

Not great, but would they be better served to get dividend payments set up monthly to themselves using their savings as an investment without touching the principle, or would it be better for them to use their principle for something else?

If they're unemployed, it'd make sense to me to use the principle (say 180k) and give themselves a monthly dividend, keeping the principle relatively intact (assuming no significant market loss).  Thoughts?",5

It's a company I don't have much faith in when it comes to actually making earnings/money at all, and if their earnings report is even close to as much of a circus as last time, I think the puts could be profitable.

I consider TSLA a lot like TWTR, YELP, LNKD in terms of profitability and business status currently, and they all had horrid quarters, so perhaps there is room for one more. 

OBviously this wouldn't be a big bet, just some money that I can afford to lose. Curious what other people think. ",4

15-05-05,34xl26,New to investing could use a bit of help.,"So I'm 28 with a decent job and need to start investing, ive opened a Roth IRA through USAA (not really having a clue what i was doing) I've put some money in a few stocks of companies that  like I.E. Tesla.  Now I want to buy some Funds for the future.  I've read a few books that people have suggested on here and it sounds like the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index funds are the way to go for someone around my age.  I checked out the funds offered by USAA and a couple others and their expenses are usually ~1% higher, with lower history of returns.  

So i guess the question is really, do I need to open another account through Vanguard or the other companies to get these funds?  Or am I really screwing something up here?

One option our sector can consider, especially given the slow trend in consolidation between players, is to make more use of strategic alliances.

Alliances seem popular in many industries because they allow companies to pursue common objectives whilst remaining independent and whilst continuing to compete in the market. 

Alliances also provide flexibility, from acting as traditional trade associations to performing more extensive forms of cooperation in chosen areas such as branding, cost reduction in procurement and manufacturing. 

The Financial Times estimates that “every one of the world’s 24 biggest carmakers by sales operates some form of alliance or joint venture with another large carmaker. Some work with as many as 10 of their rivals.”[1]

How can alliances be helpful to downstream retailers and midstream companies, and what insights can we draw from other industries?

15-05-05,34z8x5,Straddles for $TSLA earnings on Thursday,"I was thinking about buying a few straddles to play $TSLA earnings on Thursday.
However, I am a bit concerned about IV. I sold several calls for AAPL earnings and collected some nice premium, however, I only traded straddles a couple of times but never really played them on earnings.

So let me give you two examples (one ITM, and one OTM):

TSLA is trading at $232 at the moment.

Let's say I buy 1 (to keep figures simple) call at $230 (ITM) and 1 put at $240 (ITM) for $23 per contract.
I understand the most I can lose is my premium ($2,300), however, how badly will IV crush my positions?

For earnings there's a good chance it'll swing a lot either way, so IV can't hurt me too bad if I am ITM and there isn't much volume for the given strike price, correct?

Also, these contracts will expire on either May 15th or June 15th (Still deciding).

Next scenario: OTM

Let's say I buy 1 (to keep figures simple) call at $250 (OTM) and 1 put at $210 (OTM) for $6 per contract.
I understand the most I can lose is my premium ($600), however, how badly will IV crush my positions?

So for a hypothetical situation, say it swings $30 (up or down doesn't matter), will my IV crush be able to recover from the massive gain? Or will the new break even price be the price per contract + the new price of the stock, i.e. $262 (let's just pretend TSLA stays at $232). So in this case my break even would be $268?

It has to swing either way drastically during earnings, I doubt it'll go sideways, but can someone explain or give some insight?

Also, is there a guarantee of IV crush during earnings? Or does it vary?

Also, is it more conventional to buy OTM straddles or ITM?

Thanks!

Edit: That was a strangle strategy, let me use a straddle one with the same strike prices.

So we'll do one ITM call and one OTM put, then one OTM call and one ITM put:

1 call and 1 put at $230 strike (ITM call, OTM put)

1 call and 1 put at $250 strike (OTM call, ITM put)",8

* I'm worried that the bond market will tank during any taper tantrum soon

* The local housing market is WAY overheated, and will certainly face a correction

* I'm not even happy about being in cash, as this country has no formal deposit protection scheme and has a fairly well documented bail-in system for insolvent banks where depositors will certainly face a haircut in the event of problems (see impending housing correction above)

15-05-05,34y2dh,"Carl Icahn positioning for correction and is ""very hedged"". Concerned about the stock market and high yield bonds.","The link is below.  I've transcribed his comments about the markets that I believe are relevant to a discussion.  

For Discussion: Is there a catalyst for rising default rates in the high yield market?  Can further sinking to come in treasury yields explain the narrow credit spreads?

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/havent-heard-carl-icahn-bearish-135555073.html

Icahn: I’m very concerned about the market.  You have a situation where this market keeps going up and up, with zero interest rates, that’s what keeps pushing it up and up.  And yet a lot of the economic news isn’t all that good. And also, perhaps more importantly, earnings aren’t that good.  And you have the S&amp;P trading at 17x, 18x multiples.  And you wouldn’t buy a stock at 18 times that you believe earnings would go down 3%.  

(Anthony Scaramucci asks “Are you positioned for a correction?”)

Yes, we are very hedged.

What’s even more dangerous than the stock market is the high yield market—the junk bond market.  It’s ridiculously high.  For a couple of reasons, default rates are going to go up in this market, and people buy it.  They’re buying the yield and they really believe that bonds will go up.  But when they start coming down, there’s going to be a great run to the exits.  And what’s going to be worse, than even in 08, you had a bit of a safety desk with the prop desks at banks.  Today with the Volker rule, there’s no catching it.

High yields shouldn’t be at the levels they’re at.  Only 3% above treasuries, the credit spread is way too narrow.  

What if the market does really crash?  People say it can’t happen, it’s not going happen.  You’re not going to have ‘08 again.  I remember in ‘07, it’s very similar, it’s like deja vu, I was very concerned in ‘07.  The irony is that, back in ‘07, everybody knew that the housing bubble was going to burst.  But everybody was thinking, “well wait”.  

I can’t tell you it’s going to be ‘08.  I can’t predict year to year.  Anybody who does is a fool.

I have begun reading up about different types of soils grades for farmland and various governmental institutions that play a fairly large part in the actual investing aspect of farmland.

Have any of you ever owned or done research into owning large tracts of farmland that accrues an income either through the government program that pays you not to plant, renting the land out for actual use, or even farming it yourself?

I think farming is really interesting in general, but I also think long term it is an excellent investment just given growing population and fixed land masses (or in some cases, arable land being reduced – like in China).",1

Today my parents approached me and told me that one of their ""friend's friend"" is in a business where he ""bought"" one of UPS's routes and delivers for them (they specifically told me he's not just an employee, so I guess he's a contractor?).  
Anyway, they thought this was interesting and since my father wants to quit his ""shitty job"", they thought this had potential and wanted me to do some research on how and what they had to do.  



5 hours later, I've got a **shit ton** of contradicting information and instructions and so I thought I'd come on here. Some of the info insists that only corporations can buy these contracts, others say FedEx hires distributors themselves and some say you can buy routes, a truck, and your pay is based on how much work you get done (the last one seems to be the most promising)

I'm relatively new to trading and penny stocks. While I have improved over time, I am stuck with two absolute failures: GPDB and JUBPF. 

Essentially I jumped the gun on these two before knowing anything. 

For JUBPF, I was interested in the company (which happens to be on the London stock exchange: JLP). Called the broker and he told me I'd have to buy JUBPF, or something... didn't really follow what he was saying. So I bought it and lost 72%. It has extremely little volume. 

For GPDB, I thought it was a company with potential, saw there were good earnings, and thought a partnership with Amazon would make me Mitt Romney wealthy (ok, maybe not that much, but still..). Things didn't pan out as hoped and lost 76%. 

What would you advise doing? Sell both? Sell JUBPF, and hope GPDB goes back up? I obviously should have sold earlier, but that ship has sailed and I learned from my mistakes. Leaning on selling both and investing the scraps into something more sure. 

To all the beginners out there, take note. Learn as much as you can before you start trading. Even then you'll probably make mistakes, but at least try to learn from them. Happy Cinco de Mayo!",2

15-05-05,34zz14,What are ETF’s,"I somewhat alluded to ETFs in my post on investing in commodities.

Basic Definition

An ETF is known as an “exchange traded fund”. It’s somewhat similar to a mutual fund, minus all the DSC (deferred service charge) and the fact that you need a fund manager to run a mutual fund (when in reality, most mutual funds can be run by ham sandwiches).

Let’s just skip all the boring stuff from Wikipedia. What an ETF essentially does is that it allows investors like you and me to buy/sell in markets that we could not previously. If you’ve read my post on commodities, you’d know that 20 years ago, average investors could not directly invest in gold, silver, oil, copper, etc. An ETF goes around these restrictions by artificially replicating a market. Take gold for example (which I mentioned in the previous post). A gold ETF such as GLD will buy physical gold (the ETF has enough space to actually store millions of ounces of gold). Thus, when you buy GLD, you are technically buying the gold – all that GLD does is provide you access to buying gold.

Thanks to Wall Street and all their financial “innovation”, many new markets are now accessible. Let’s assume that you’re bullish on the banking sector. 20 years ago when ETF’s did not exist, you had one of two choices:

Pick the banks that you like best and hope that they outperform the banks you didn’t buy.
If you don’t know which banks will perform the best (but you are bullish on the banking industry in general), you can buy every single bank stock.
Now obviously, buying every single bank stock is a huge hassle. What a bank ETF like XLF will do is create an investment vehicle that will synthetically “represent” the entire banking industry. It’s beautiful. :D ETF’s simplify things.

In another example, let’s assume that you’re bullish on the entire U.S. stock market, aka the S&amp;P500. 20 years ago, you would have had to buy all 500 stocks. Considering how the S&amp;P500 is weighted (not all companies are weighted equally in the S&amp;P500), the effort of balancing all these shares in your portfolio is too time consuming. But nowadays, ETF’s such as SPY (the largest ETF out there for stocks) is dedicated to tracking the S&amp;P500. Thus, when you buy SPY, you are artificially buying the S&amp;P500. Cool, isn’t it?

Leveraged ETF’s

Over the past 10 years, leveraged ETF’s (a special branch of ETF’s) have gained in popularity. For guys like me, the S&amp;P makes me want to cry. Over the past 6 months, the S&amp;P500 has gained a grand total of 5%. That’s chicken scratch! What a leveraged ETF does is it multiplies the gains and losses of the underlying security. There are 3 types of leveraged ETF’s:

2x leverage
3x leverage
4x leverage
Here’s an example of what a leveraged ETF will do. Let’s say you the S&amp;P500 increased by 2% in one day. SPDR (the 2x leveraged S&amp;P500 ETF) will increase by 4% (2×2=4). On Day 2, let’s say that the S&amp;P500 fell by 3%. SPDR will fall by 6%.

Unfortunately, leveraged ETF’s having matching problems. They generally don’t track the underlying security as well as non-leveraged ETF’s do. Here’s an example.

Let’s say that the S&amp;P500 fell by 40%. A 3x leveraged ETF will not fall by 120% (40×3=120) – an ETF cannot have negative value! This phenomenon is because of the way ETF’s are calculated (Gr. 12 math).

The implications of a leveraged ETF is obvious – it increases volatility. Now I generally don’t touch 4x ETF’s (and rarely do I touch 3x). The volatility is just too much for me to take.

Conclusion

An ETF is just an investment vehicle. Nothing more. It’s not like investing in a hedge fund where a hedge fund manager actively buys and sells markets. An ETF only seeks to match the underlying market as closely as possible.

Once again, I hope you learned something from reading this post about ETF’s!",1

She did address high yield debt: ""We've also seen a compression in spreads on high yield debt, which certainly seems like a reach for yield type behavior""

I'm mostly in a lifecycle fund at Vanguard.  Lets call it [Exhibit A](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0306&amp;FundIntExt=INT).  As you can see, the fund supposedly gets 7.26% per year avg over a 10 yr period.  Nice and balanced, nice and safe.

So, of course I looked at the other Vanguard offerings. Here's [Exhibit B](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0052&amp;FundIntExt=INT).  13.75% avg over 10 yrs...and 17.63% avg since inception.

Now then:  I have heard it said that sector investment is not a wise choice. You're simply not diversified enough to avoid pain in a downturn.  That said, the inception date for Exhibit B was 1984...31 years.  31 years of consistently kicking ass compared to the market average.  People just keep getting older and sicker, too.  Population's still growing.  Yadda yadda.

15-05-06,352xni,CSIQ - Earnings Tomorrow!,"Definitely going to be an interesting morning for me as I do find myself holding some Chinese Solar stocks. Today has the typical sell off prior to the earnings report that is known to cause huge swings. I am sure short interest is rising, and if it's a bad report then down she goes, if it's a good report and outlook there should be a good hike and a short squeeze to boost it higher. 

For me, best case scenario is a beat, positive outlook, and concrete plans for a yieldco in 2015. 

Good/bad case scenario, it doesn't beat, has good outlook and yieldco plans, stock drops and I add to my position.

Worst case, it doesn't beat, bad outlook, no yieldco, I would have to leave my position and wait for things to change before I see it as a value play again. I don't see this scenario happening, but I am ready for it anyways. 

A good outcome for CSIQ will typically shoot all solar stocks up, especially other Chinese solar plays. Anyone else going to paying attention to the earnings report? ",3

i got something for ya. this damn bitcoin stock i've been following out of interest for the last 12 months - essentially a bitcoin miner and bitcoin transaction desk, was running low on cash and earnings were alright but probably gonna require a cap. raising in 12 months time (end of this year approximately). thing was a dead stock as you can see from its chart.. tiny volumes and a constant drop off in SP. not sitting on many peoples watchlists.

so they were developing some fintech behind the scenes but were staying relatively quiet on them, for obvious reasons. so they come out just over a week ago with a really vague announcement, containing this line:

""Specifically, the IP associated with Blockchain provides a major competitive advantage for the disruption of the other non-Bitcoin related financial services markets. Significant development work has been undertaken ..... new product launch over coming weeks""

so the market doesn't really react, this is a small cap stock that no one is paying attention to, its not fuckn tesla or apple so you can't be vague and have people jizz their pants and throw money at you like you're a hooker

so skip to yesterday and the company makes this goddamn announcement:
http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20150505/pdf/42yc7pf9rf4krb.pdf

they come out of freaking left field and slip out this product announcement for what i believe is the fkn next p2p global market pandemonium super-hyped application. turning small shops and businesses all around the world into agents for a global remittance market, where they are incentivized by revenue sharing deals. maybe i've smoked too much recently, but the sheer potential of this.... remittance market $583b in 2014, $436b from developing countries... they could literally create commerce in underdeveloped areas, all you need is a net connection. 

anyways, i'm long this stock for more money than i should be, bought in today. up 80~% yesterday and 25~% today. thing is still capped &lt;$30m. fuck it, i needed an opportunity to yolo, so this is it! 

its a crazy fucking find, imo, you're literally getting the opportunity to buy into a stock that is undervalued during the VC stage of investment. it is changing business tangents here as it when it floated just over a year ago, so the market is still adjusting to try and figure out what the new company is. if you look up the stock, check out the ceo and his prior involvement with google adwords in its early days, hes a smart cunt.

These distortions cause movements in the gases, which affect the amount of radiation given off by the Sun. This radiation, in various forms, travels from the Sun to the planets. One form, the particles making up the solar wind, travel in paths that are steered by the planets. This solar variation in radiation causes a variety of changes in the earth's environment, such as heating effects, electromagnetic effects, various weather changes, etc. These environmental changes in turn cause changes in human behavior which is most detectable in data that reect mass behavior, such as financial markets. 
The Sun gives off radiation which varies by about 2%. The variations are caused by tidal forces that the revolving planets exert on the gases in the Sun.These tides cause vortexes in the Sun’s surface leading to solar flares, coronal holes, and magnetic storms. The energy changes from these are carried to Earth on an ionized stream of particles called the Solar Wind.
When the Solar Wind reaches Earth it is deflected around the Earth by the Earth’s magnetic field. This creates a magnetosphere around the Earth. At the poles ionized particles can penetrate the Earth’s atmosphere. Changes in the solar radiation cause changes in the voltage in the ionosphere.
This in turn causes changes in the electrical currents flowing through humans on Earth. These emotional swings account for about 40% of price motion.



Proof: 

In early 1968 the quasi gold standard was more or less abolished, which lead to the inevitable expansion in money supply and inflation. Since that time every solar top made a bubble burst, in 3 of the 4 cases even in the same or following month which is incredibly precise:
HIGH of Solar Cycle #20 in 11/1968: stock market bubble bursts 12/1968 (the S&amp;P 500 high of late 1968 was only exceeded nominally but not in real terms for decades)
HIGH of Solar Cycle #21 in 12/1979: commodity bubble bursts 1/1980
HIGH of Solar Cycle #22 in 7/1989: Japan bubble (stocks &amp; real estate) bursts 12/1989
HIGH of Solar Cycle #23 in 3/2000: stock market bubble bursts 3/2000
The more sun-spots, the more important for financial markets. The solar super-storms of 1859, 1921 and 1989 went along with inflation peaks (Credits: Manfred Zimmel):
September 1-2, 1859 (highest inflation 1810-1910).
May, 1921 (highest inflation 1860-1940).
1989 (highest inflation since mid 1960s).",2

15-05-06,353jjh,"Investing, Simply Explained","I've found that some common investors (some of which are on this sub) have a deeply flawed approach to investing. Investing is not ""will this company sell more products in 5 years"" or ""will marijuana be legal""? These are predictions, not investing, and without knowing the difference, your returns are going to be below average. I wrote up a little primer on investing on my blog, and wanted to share it below for anyone who might be new to investing.

For what it's worth, I used to fall in the ""prediction"" camp, until i spent thousands of hours reading about investing, so my aim is to help put people on the right path. I hope this proves helpful:


**What is Buying a Stock? (A Primer on Intrinsic Value)**

It's a foregone conclusion that the common investor regularly underperforms the market. Maybe it's their emotions getting in the way, or they can't see their own ignorance, or perhaps some combination of the two. While these, and many other faults, are surely prevalent, they are not the greatest impediment to healthy returns. Instead, there is a fundamental misperception behind the concepts of both shares and stocks that must be remedied if one wishes to achieve consistent returns. I believe that:  

* The common investor doesn't know what ""a share"" fundamentally represents. 

* There is a perverse disconnect between a *company* and its stock

By not understanding these two basic (yet often taken-for-granted) concepts, an investor has no business investing in anything but an index fund. At the most fundamental level, an investor has to understand that when buying a share of a company, what you are really buying is a percentage of the company's total worth. It therefore follows that the right question to ask isn't ""will this stock price go higher"" but rather **""what is this company worth""** (and can I buy it for less than that)?


**So What is a Share?**

We can easily look up the definition of a [share](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shares.asp), and find that it's ""one of the equal parts into which a company's capital is divided, entitling the holder to a proportion of the profits."" Sounds easy enough, but for those who don't have a solid accounting or business background (i.e. the common investor), this is far less clear than one might think. 

I've often seen the mistake of 200 shares being ipso facto ""better"" than 100 shares. While some might laugh and say those people are foolish, this belief is surprisingly prevalent. I know many who view the share price as being indicative of how ""good"" a company is. It's fairly commonplace to think that Company A, priced at $50/share, is a better company than Company B, because it's at $20/share. Sillier yet, people will avoid Company A, because it's ""more expensive"" than Company B (at least on a per-share basis). People fail to grasp that when you buy a share of stock, what you're really doing is buying a **piece of that business.** Owning a share entitles you to claims on the cash, assets, and future profits (and losses). Put more simply, a share is nothing more than a percent ownership of a company.

To make it easier, think of it like a pizza. Would you rather have 1 slice of a pizza pie or 12.5%? Well, that all depends on how many slices are cut from the pie. If the pie is only cut into 4 slices, then 1 slice represents 25% instead of the measly 12.5%. Extending this same logic to shares of a company, we now know that the actual number of shares really doesn't matter. What does matter is the percent of the business a share represents. All things being equal, 1 share of a company with 100k total shares available is very different than 1 share of a company with 10k shares.


**Company vs. Its Stock**

Now that we know that a share represents a percentage of ownership, we have to ask **""what is this company worth?""** No doubt, this is an intimidating question. Do we add up all the assets? Do we look at the cash in the bank? Do we look at future profit? How do we account for untapped markets, technology shifts or unreleased products? There is no simple answer, but answer it we must. People spend too much time trying to predict the upward or downward squiggle of stock price instead of trying to make sense of what a company is worth, but once we determine the worth of a company, it's easy to figure out what to pay per share. 

It helps to look at a very basic example. Let's say you were offered an opportunity to buy 50% of a company. You've done your homework, and know that this company owns a building worth $10m alone, in addition to some other profitable operations. There are only 2 shares of the company available, so what would you pay for 1 share? Well we know the company is at least worth $10m (from the building), so all things being equal, we'd likely jump at the offer to pay anything significantly less than $5m for 1 share (i.e. 50% of the business).

Now say there are 100 shares available. Would you still pay $5m for a single share? Probably not because one share now entitles you to a mere 1% of the company; or $100k. It's obvious that paying $5m for $100k of value is not a prudent decision, and this is exactly the same type of mental exercise an investor must go through when deciding on whether to invest in a company.

After this slight change in mental framework, we can move on to the hard part; how to value a company. This is the fun (and difficult) part, and we can get there many different ways. Maybe we add up everything the company owns and owes, what they take in/pay out in cash, and then trying to figure out what all that is worth. Or we could only look at the balance sheet (where assets like real estate, equipment, cash and investments live). Further still,  we can try looking at future earning potential of the company, and figure out what those earnings are worth **today** (this is called [discounting](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discountrate.asp), and you must understand it intimately). 


**Conclusion**

It's vitally important to remember you're not betting on whether a some little squiggly line will go up or down, nor are you estimating exact future sales figures. In the purest, most simple form, the only thing you should be trying to answer is **""what is this company worth?""**. ​If you cannot do this, you should not be investing in anything other than index funds. I would recommend Vanguard's.

However according to her overall risks to financial stability remains stable and contained.

Ms. Yellen has also warned against sharp bond market movement especially on the longer end of the curve, when Federal Reserve would start hiking rates.

Bond market impact -

* Fed rate hike might give rise to term premium which might shoot up rapidly posing significant risks to investors shorting longer dated bond. Moreover recent rise in global bond yields indicate that investors are growing anxious over holding longer dated government securities as they fear of inflation in coming time.

Stock market impact -

* Equity market is long due a major correction so any significant sell off does not mean that good old bullish days are over for equities as return of global growth would be price supportive of equities.

 
* Clear 10-20% correction in the index might be sweet spot to buy.
Volatility -

Chart is attached that shows 5 day average of realized volatility in SPX500 index.

* Realized daily volatility remains low, around 1%, however volatility clustering is warning against volatile days ahead.

S&amp;P500 is trading close to 2077, key support lies at 2040 level.

15-05-07,356lfp,Mind The $76 Trillion Global Bond Bubble Even The Experts Are Getting Scared,"Warren Buffett believes “that bonds are very overvalued“, and a recent survey of fund managers found that 80 percent of them are convinced that bonds have become “badly overvalued“.  The most famous bond expert on the planet, Bill Gross, recently confessed that he has a sense that the 35 year bull market in bonds is “ending” and he admitted that he is feeling “great unrest”.  Nobel Prize–winning economist Robert Shiller has added a new chapter to his bestselling book in which he argues that bond prices are “irrationally high”.  The global bond bubble has ballooned to more than 76 trillion dollars, and interest rates have never been lower in modern history.  In fact, 25 percent of all government bonds in Europe actually have a negative rate of return at this point.  There is literally nowhere for the bond market to go except for the other direction, and when this bull market turns into a bear it will create chaos and financial devastation all over the planet.

In a recent piece entitled “A Sense Of Ending“, bond guru Bill Gross admitted that the 35 year bull market in bonds that has made him and those that have invested with him so wealthy is now coming to an end…

Stanley Druckenmiller, George Soros, Ray Dalio, Jeremy Grantham, among others warn investors that our 35 year investment supercycle may be exhausted. They don’t necessarily counsel heading for the hills, or liquidating assets for cash, but they do speak to low future returns and the increasingly fat tail possibilities of a “bang” at some future date. To them, (and myself) the current bull market is not 35 years old, but twice that in human terms. Surely they and other gurus are looking through their research papers to help predict future financial “obits”, although uncertain of the announcement date. Savor this Bull market moment, they seem to be saying in unison. It will not come again for any of us; unrest lies ahead and low asset returns. Perhaps great unrest, if there is a bubble popping.

And the way that he ended his piece sounds rather ominous…

I wish to still be active in say 2020 to see how this ends. As it is, in 2015, I merely have a sense of an ending, a secular bull market ending with a whimper, not a bang. But if so, like death, only the timing is in doubt. Because of this sense, however, I have unrest, increasingly a great unrest. You should as well.

Bill Gross is someone that knows what he is talking about.  I would consider his words very carefully.

Another renowned financial expert, Yale professor Robert Shiller, warned us about the stock bubble in 2000 and about the real estate bubble in 2005.  Now, he is warning about the danger posed by this bond bubble…

In the first edition of his landmark book “Irrational Exuberance,” published in 2000, the Yale professor of economics and 2013 Nobel Laureate presciently warned that stocks looked especially expensive. In the second edition, published in 2005 shortly before the real estate bubble crashed, he added a chapter about real estate valuations. And in the new edition, due out later this month, Shiller adds a fresh chapter called “The Bond Market in Historical Perspective,” in which he worries that bond prices might be irrationally high.

For years, ultra-low interest rates have enabled governments around the world to go on a debt binge unlike anything the world has ever seen.  Showing very little restraint since the last financial crisis, they have piled up debts that are exceedingly dangerous.  If interest rates were to return to historical norms, it would instantly create the greatest government debt crisis in history.

A recent letter from IceCap Asset Management summarized where we basically stand today…

Considering:

1) governments are unable to eliminate deficits

2) global government debt is increasing exponentially

3) 0% interest rates are allowing governments to borrow more to pay off old loans and fund deficits

4) Global growth is declining despite money printing and bailouts And, we’ve saved the latest and greatest fact for last: as stunning as 0% interest rates sound, the mathematically-challenged-fantasyland called Europe has just one upped everyone by introducing NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES.

As of writing, over 25% of all bonds issued by European governments has a guaranteed negative return for investors.

Germany can borrow money for 5 years at an interest rate of NEGATIVE 0.10%. Yes, instead of Germany paying you interest when you lend them money, you have to pay them interest.

These same negative interest rate conditions exist across many of the Eurozone countries, as well as Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland.

Negative interest rates are by nature irrational.

Why in the world would you pay someone to borrow money from you?

It doesn’t make any sense at all, and this irrational state of affairs will not last for too much longer.

At some point, investors are going to come to the realization that the 35 year bull market for bonds is finished, and then there will be a massive rush for the exits.  This rush for the exits will be unlike anything the bond market has ever seen before.  Robert Wenzel of the Economic Policy Journal says that this coming rush for the exits will set off a “death spiral”…

Anyone who holds the view that the Fed will not soon raise interest rates,and soon, fails to understand the nature of the developing crisis. It will be led by a collapse of the bond market.

Market forces, somewhat misleadingly called bond-vigilantes, will lead the charge.

I am not as bearish in the short-term on the stock market. The equity markets will be volatile because of the climb in rates and look scary at times but the death spiral will be in the bond market.

As this death spiral accelerates, we are going to see global interest rates rise dramatically.  And considering the fact that more than 400 trillion dollars in derivatives are directly tied to interest rates, that is a very scary thing.

And in case you are wondering, the stock market will be deeply affected by all of this as well.  I believe that we are going to witness a stock market crash even greater than what we experienced in 2008, and other experts are projecting similar things.  For example, just consider what Marc Faber recently told CNBC…

“For the last two years, I’ve been thinking that U.S. stocks are due for a correction,” Faber said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” “But I always say a bubble is a bubble, and if there’s no correction, the market will go up, and one day it will go down, big time.”

“The market is in a position where it’s not just going to be a 10 percent correction. Maybe it first goes up a bit further, but when it comes, it will be 30 percent or 40 percent minimum!” Faber asserted.

Where we are right now is at the end of the party.  There are some that want to keep on dancing to the music for as long as possible, but most can see that things are winding down and people are starting to head for the exits.

The irrational global financial bubble that investors have been enjoying for the past few years has stretched on far longer than it should have.  But that is the way irrational bubbles work – they just keep going even when everyone can see that they have become absolutely absurd.  However, eventually something always comes along and bursts them, and once that happens markets can crash very, very rapidly.

15-05-07,355ndl,Effects of Various Economic Conditions on the Markets,"When I asked Pauline about writing a second guest post here, she suggested I talk about factors that will affect the average investor’s retirement nest egg. So in this post, I’ll be discussing the various economic and historical conditions that will affect investors in the medium tern (1-5 years) and long term future (5 to 10 years out), and how you can prepare yourself when each of these conditions hit.

Inflation
Without going into the arcane and pointless details, I’ll explain QE (quantitative easing) in good ole’ plain English. QE is the Federal Reserve’s way of printing money, thereby injecting more and more liquidity (money) into the financial system. Bernake (Fed Chairman) believes that this will pull the American economy out of the muck for good, and right now, whether this is working or not is still questionable.

HOWEVER, quantitative easing does have a problem – the printing of money theoretically speaking should cause inflation. But since QE first began, inflation has been virtually non-existent. How come?

According to theory, printing money causes inflation. BUT, what the economy has been experiencing post-recession is a deflationary environment. The economy isn’t doing too well, and prices should be declining. But with the Fed’s printing of money, the deflation is negated, resulting in zero inflation.

However, sooner or later (probably sooner, along the lines of 1 – 2 years) inflation is going to (finally) pick up. Why? Think of it this way. Deflation has always existed, and the Fed’s printing of money has been negating this deflation. However, soon that negation will be over (when the inflation is sufficient enough to totally negate the deflation), and the printing of money will finally cause real inflation.

So what do you do when inflation hits? Historically speaking, investors think that inflation is bad for stocks. That’s a huge misconception. This misconception only exists because stocks went flat in the 1970s when inflation was huge. HOWEVER, the 1970s were an anomaly – we experienced stagflation, when inflation was coupled with a sagging economy. In most cases, inflation occurs in a growing economy (or in today’s case, a nominally growing GDP). I believe that this time around, the recovery is real and that we’re not going to experience stagflation.

Hence, I think that buying stocks would be great when inflation hits. When inflation comes around, currencies get devalued and nominally speaking stock prices rise, leading to greater returns for equity investors.

Devaluation
Devaluation is closely linked to inflation – when governments print money, the real value of their currencies becomes devalued. Whenever currencies get devalued, all hard assets such as stocks and commodities shoot up in price. Speaking of commodities…

The Once in a Lifetime Opportunity
People believe that precious metals are a hedge against an economic downturn. Again, that’s a misconception. When the 2008 recession hit, precious metals (gold and silver) actually fell the hardest. This misconception originates (again) from the 1970s when a crappy economy was coupled with soaring gold and silver prices.

Precious metals rose in the 1970s not because of the poor economy but because of inflation. The 1970s were a rare case of stagflation, something that doesn’t fit in with today. Currently, the economy is humming along, but inflation will be a big issue. Thus, when inflation starts to creep up it will be a once in a lifetime opportunity for medium term investors who are willing to hold onto their gold and silver positions for at least a year.

The Fight for Resources
There’s a prime fundamental reason (besides inflation) that supports the rise in commodity prices (especially gold and silver). It’s simple. We have fewer and fewer resources to feed a larger and larger population. When Thomas Malthus first predicted that the world would end (this was back in 1798), he forgot to factor in technology. Technological improvements can increase the efficiency at which we extract our resources. HOWEVER, even technology has a limit. The efficiency is ultimately limited to the amount of resources we have. Currently, the world is reaching a turning point. If all the emerging market nations start to consume at the rate Americans do, the world’s resources would be gone sooner rather than later. When the demand for raw materials goes up and the supply goes down, prices will soar.

Historical Charts
You’ve all heard it – historically, the U.S. stock market has yielded (on average) 7.5% returns. That’s actually a really clever lie concocted by brokers and financial groups to get you to purchase equities.

The “average of 7.5%” is from the post-War period. If you look at a different time frame, such as if you were to include the Great Depression, the “average rate of return” is a lot less. That’s what the financial industry does – repackaging facts to make them look better than when they first came in.

The post-war period is actually an anomaly, a period of unprecedented economic growth that is unlikely to be repeated again in the near future. This growth was caused by major technological revolutions, from household appliances to computers to the internet and high speed communications. Today? Come on guys – the market is going to grow at 7.5% with a bunch of undergrads making $0.99 iPhone apps.

My point is, if the stock market is going to pick up its pace in the long run, it needs to be supported by major technological leaps. Unfortunately, since the dawn of the internet our society’s brightest have been attracted towards the fast money of internet riches, drawn away from solid industries that actually contribute to mankind’s life (think of space mining, green energy – the capital intensive industries). Thus, without any major technological revolutions happening right now how can we expect economic and market growth to pick up? We can’t. There’s no driver for the growth engine.

The Summary
To sum it all up, I’m going to divide things into two time frames. The medium time frame is the 1-5 year outlook, whereas the long term outlook is 5-20 years.

For the medium outlook, things are looking decidedly positive. Once inflation picks up (which is inevitable with all the money printing), stocks and commodities are going to soar, particularly gold and silver whose bull markets aren’t over.

However, the long term is less positive. Sure, the stock market will still experience long term bull markets. But I don’t think the average rate of return will be 7.5% anymore, unless we experience another major technological breakthrough. The problem is that these breakthroughs are the results of years and years of work, something that hasn’t happened thanks to all our smartest engineers being attracted to industries that do not really contribute that much to mankind. (I like Facebook as much as the next guy in line, but hey, it hasn’t had as much an impact on my life as the advent of the computer has.)",1

15-05-07,356r70,Question about bonds,"Hi everyone,  with the recent decline in the bond market, it has sparked my interest. I know a lot of people here recommend to allocate a big chunk of your portfolio in bonds, but I was always lured to the big numbers of the regular stocks. With the uncertainty in the markets nowadays, they seem pretty attractive.

Questions:

1. Does the payout of the 'coupon' happen every year? Do you get taxed on this? Or can I only cash out this coupon after the expiry date of the bond?

2. I was looking at the Apple 30 year bonds. If I understand it correctly, I can buy this bond and get the yearly coupon, and I get the initial capital invested back at the end of these 30 years. Where can I find the 'face value' of a bond? I trade using Interactive Brokers, and the current 30 year bond for AAPL is at 102. I  assume that the face value of this bond used to be $100? I can't find information in IB anywhere what the face value is.

3. You could technically buy and sell these bonds too, right? If I buy 10x102 bonds and they go up to 105 in 2 years, I will receive 2 x  the coupon of 4,5% and 10x105? 

Lastly, would you recommend buying bonds at this point? They seem to have a nice yield, so for long term I think having a big chunk of my money in them would be a wise choice. Thanks!",1

15-05-07,356z4v,Why History Tells Us to Be Bullish on 2015,"My latest article focuses on something David Tepper touched on during his latest speech at the 2015 Ira Sohn Investment Conference, Equity Risk Premiums.  Specifically, I examined the correlation between Forward P/E Ratios and the inverse combination of the U.S. Ten Year Treasury Yields and Dividend Yields in the S&amp;P 500.  I proved the theory to be extremely accurate (it held true 93% of the time over the last 15 years).  After applying the theory to current 2015 metrics, I arrived at the conclusion that one of two things should happen by the end of the year.

Either:

* Yields in U.S. Treasuries rise significantly, OR

* The S&amp;P 500 still has significant upside in the form of multiple expansion.

Ultimately, I arrived at the conclusion that - should the historical theory hold true this year - the S&amp;P 500 Index still has 17% upside between now and the end of the year.

As is always the case, this summary doesn't provide all the important details, so please [read it all here](http://prosperityactiveyield.tumblr.com/post/118372990728/why-history-tells-us-to-be-bullish-on-the-market).

What do you all think?  Is there still 17% upside by year-end?

EDIT:  **I have updated the results to include ANOTHER 15 YEARS.  The theory is now tested over the last three decades.**  [Read the updated results here](http://prosperityactiveyield.tumblr.com/post/118372990728/why-history-tells-us-to-be-bullish-on-the-market)

15-05-07,357at8,"How to Screen for Biotech Companies - 4,000% returns in the past 5 years.","Biotechnology is one of the fastest growing industry, returning over 200% in the past five years. However, a lot of these gains come from smaller companies that ""hit it big"" when their treatment successfully makes it through trials. So the question then becomes: When buying bio, do you focus on the small fish, or the whales? 

The Screens: 

**Baby Bio**

In this screen we will be searching the market for small biotechnology companies that seem to be pouring money into research and are either in trials are gearing up to start them. 


*The earnings per share over the past year is less than 0.

*The company is spending more than $5,000,000 every year on R&amp;D.

*The close is less than 3 dollars

*The net income of the stock must be growing over the past year.

*The change of close over the past year must be over 15%

**Bio Whales**

In this screen we will be searching for biotechnology companies that have already established themselves and have made significant returns to investors and will most likely continue to do so.

*Earnings per share must be above zero

*Net income must be growing over the past year.

*The close must be over $20

*The change of the close over the paste 90 days needs to be over 10%

*The company must be spending a minimum of $100,000,000 every year on R&amp;D

**The Results:**


**Baby Bio:**


Total 5-year return 	 4557.33%

Annualized Return 	 104.32%

Total Trades	 72

Best Trade	 INHX(341.05%)

Worst Trade	 TTNP(-71.28%)

**Bio Whales:**

Total 5-year return 	 291.34%

Annualized Return 	 50.09%

Total Trades	 66

Best Trade	 GILD(55.7%)

Worst Trade	 SHPG(-10.89%)


**What are the Risks?**


At this point you've probably been convinced that investing in the baby bio screen would be your best option, I mean look at that return, over 4,500% in just five years is pure insanity! And that's really what it boils down to... insanity. Sure seeing that massive jump is great, and we all wish we could have bought into it way earlier but hindsight is always 20/20. We need to look in the now, and into the future. But, in order to do that we need to study the past. 


Baby Bio:

This is really the kicker. I know for a fact that your mouth started watering the moment you saw those returns. However, your brain should have been screaming at you to be skeptical. So how did Baby Bio return so much over the past five years? Where does it all come from? 

First, we need to look at how long this strategy has actually been effective. It is known that prior to around 2010 the whole biotechnology industry had a fairly mediocre performance. However, since 2010 there has been explosive growth across the entire industry. 

As you can see, prior to 2012 Baby biotechs not only underperformed the market, they lost you money. At one point you would have lost over 90% of your account value. 

Not only do these stocks do poorly throughout history, the stocks that fit the profile have almost no indicators that would suggest a buy rating. Investing in this area of the sector, though it has made a lot of money in the past five years, is more a sophisticated form of gambling than investing.


Bio Whales:
Much like the baby bio stocks the bio whales didn't start performing until after 2010, actually the larger companies didn't start returning a significant amount until 2012. However, the biggest loss your account ever suffered was only 35%. Though it's still not positive it's better than an almost 100% loss, and can be recovered from. 

Unlike the Baby Bio stocks many of the stocks picked by the bio whales screener have multiple indications that they would be a good long purchase. Not only that, but most of the picks are much larger and have daily news and in depth analysis - helping you become an informed investor rather than a clueless gambler. 


**So, What's Better?**

Honestly? I have absolutely no idea. Personally I'd take  portion of your portfolio and experiment with both sides leaning more heavily towards one or the other based on how much risk you are willing to handle. Personally, being younger, I would lean more towards the baby bio picks, though I would put in extensive research on each company and try to be as informed as possible. My mom on the other hand would lean more towards the Bio Whales screen. She's older and on her way to retirement in about 10-15 years. She's more likely to take the lower return in order to make sure her money stays safe. 


So in short, neither investment strategy is better than the other. It just depends who you are and what sort of risks you are willing to take.

15-05-08,358vgn,How does Currency Trading Work,"Because this is an investing for beginners series (check out my last post on stocks), today we’re going to cover a different market – the currency market.

You might not believe this – the stock market is actually one of the smallest markets out there! That’s why some large investment funds (hedge funds, banks, etc) need to trade currencies – the stock market is just not big enough to absorb all their cash! On the other hand, the currency market is huge – trillions of dollars are traded every day, meaning that there is massive liquidity in this market.

The Difference Between Currency Trading and Investing in Stocks
When you’re investing in stocks, you’re making an absolute bet. You’re betting that the price will go up (or down, if you’re shorting a stock. “Shorting” is a concept we’ll cover later on).

Currencies, on the other hand, is a relative bet. You’re betting that one currency will perform better relative to another country’s currency. Here’s an example. Let’s look at a hypothetical situation involving the world’s two dominant currencies: the Euro and the USD (U.S. dollar).

Euro goes up, but the USD goes up even more. Thus, relative to the USD, the Euro weakened.
Euro goes up, but the USD goes up a little bit less. Thus, relative to the USD, the Euro strengthened.
Euro goes down, but the USD goes down even more. Thus, relative to the USD, the Euro strengthen
Euro goes down, but the USD goes down less. Thus, relative to the USD, the Euro weakened.
That’s why currency trading is more difficult that investing or trading stocks. Instead of considering one single variable (will Stock A’s price go up or down), you’re considering two variables (how will currency A perform relative to currency B?).

Thus, when you trade currencies you’re always buying a currency and selling another currency. For example, if I buy the Euro and sell the USD, I’m betting that the Euro will appreciate relative to the USD. Oppositely, if I buy the USD and sell the Euro, I’m betting that the USD will appreciate relative to Euro.

Currencies are Listed in Pairs
A currency does not have an absolute value. A currency such as the Euro is always written as relative to another currency. For example, if you hear “the value of the Euro today is $1.35″ on the news, it’s saying that the Euro-to-USD ratio is 1 Euro = $1.35 USD. Thus (if you do the calculation), the USD-to-Euro ratio is 1 USD = 0.74 Euro’s.

Because of the 1994 Bretton Wood agreement, all currencies around the world are priced in USD (making the U.S. dollar the global reserve currency). Thus, Yen (Japan’s currency) is listed in USD, the Euro is listed in USD, the CAD (Canadian dollar) is listed in USD, and so on. In order to convert from e.g. Yen to Euro, one must first convert from Yen to USD and then USD to Euro (taking the USD as the “middleman”).

Two Types of Currencies
Because of the pecking order of our world, currencies around the world are generally classified into 2 types: major currencies and exotic currencies. As you can probably guess, major currencies are the currencies of the large countries: Euro (for Europe), the CAD (for Canada), the Yen (for Japan). Believe it or not, the Yuan (China’s currency) is not considered a “major currency” because the Chinese government pegs the Yuan to the USD, thus not allowing the Yuan to float.

On the other hand, exotic currencies are the currencies of small (and often volatile) nations. This includes the Mexican peso and the Russian ruble.

As a rule of thumb, most currency traders stay away from exotic currencies – those nations often have unpredictable governments that can easily hurt investors and currency traders.",1

I know getting greedy is an awful thing to do, especially if you are just rolling the dice and hoping, but I was wondering if anyone has ever done this...

Amazon on the year has increased about 35% and for the 1 year return it's about 50% increase...

Investing $5,000 here and there will only make you a couple thousand over the year, and this is the safe approach...but have any of you ever said screw it and put 80% of your net worth into a stock like this?  I know you run the risk of losing it all, but if you put 100k on this stock, wait 6 months for a 20-30% increase (if it comes) then you effectively just made YEARS worth of profits compared to what you have been able to deposit through work wages.

As a 24 year old with X amount, I'm sort of in the prime of my life in terms of being able to risk it ""all"", even if I only did 50% of my net worth.

Seems like if I lost X amount it would suck, but I could recover, but if I made that 50% gain, then I just took years off my working life. 

Just an interesting thought.

Does this mean the best time to buy a bond ETF is when rates are low (and thus not many people are interested in bonds) because the stock price of the ETF would also be low as a result of lower demand?

If bond rates are low now, would a Bond ETF be a good place to store money, if an investor was concerned about the potential of a significant correction?

15-05-07,357u2e,Thoughts on NCOM? (My father is investing heavily),"Hey everyone,

So my Dad is really loading up on NCOM. Calls or texts me almost everyday to either brag about his gains or to gripe about the market.

He claims he has 1,000 shares, but wants to continue buying more. I'm not sure the price he paid for these 1,000 shares, which I understand is a big missing factor here. It's impossible to determine his returns. 

One thing I have noticed is the company's insiders have directly purchased quite a few shares recently at $19.50, which is typically a good sign.

I'm just worried because my father has made some *extremely*
bad choices with things like penny stocks in the past. And he completely neglects things like S&amp;P index funds and large cap companies. Basically, he doesn't understand asset allocation at all and puts all his eggs into one basket. NCOM is his one and only basket.

I don't know much about this company and I'd like to hear from you guys. Is it healthy? Is it moving in the right direction?

Thank you for your time.",2

Not long ago, this touched $1.40 and was trading consistently in the .80 range.. Looking at the chart, not many shares (overall) bought/sold in the range it's in now.

* Liabilities are the same as debt.

I got a response from one of their people saying that they needed more information from me because I was living outside of the US. I thought it was strange but ok (post 9/11 issues I suppose). After providing the requested information I got another message from Scottrade saying that my account is being limited in functionality and I will only be able to close positions, further to that my account will be closed in 60 days. 
 
I've responded to their message saying that it's unacceptable for them to do this to me and requested them to provide the section in their terms of service that says they can do this to a US citizen that was relocated for work. 
 
Has anyone had this occur to them? More importantly was anyone able to stop them? My account isn't a small account and I'm also assuming they will forcibly close my positions for me if I don't close them myself. That would cause an unfavorable tax event.
 
Appreciate if anyone could provide any advice or previous experience.

 edit:
These were the reasons given to me by Scottrade. None of them make sense to me.

http://ih.advfn.com/p.php?pid=nmona&amp;article=65322755 


2) Entering BITCOIN market via exclusive joint venture! BITCOIN market is one of the hottest ones out there right now - huge potential for $BETS! 

http://ih.advfn.com/p.php?pid=nmona&amp;article=65391051 


3) $BETS signs JV agreement to issue a real time BITCOIN debit card with a major international credit card brand. The market for debit card users could become a very large business for the company in its own right independent of their gaming platform! As of today there were 13,922,025 BITCOINS in circulation with a market capitalization of $3.9 billion dollars. 

http://ih.advfn.com/p.php?pid=nmona&amp;article=65792066 


4) Turnover revenue of $10,750,114 &amp; gross profit of $643,200 in 2014! This penny stock is actually making real money - true rarity among sub-penny stocks! 

http://ih.advfn.com/p.php?pid=nmona&amp;article=65162265 


5) 1rst quarter amounts staked were approximately $2,125,000 (€1,638,873). Gross profit in the 1rst quarter was approximately $158,921 (€149,925). Gross profit was 18 percent higher then the same period last year. In the first quarter we also registered 2551 new customers and processed over 32,100 bets. Gross profits just keep on growing quarter over quarter - it is only the matter of time until $BETS is cash-flow positive! 

http://ih.advfn.com/p.php?pid=nmona&amp;article=66426550 


6) $BETS is one of the top 100 bookmakers WORLDWIDE! We are talking WORLD SCALE with this company! 

http://www.top100bookmakers.com/ 


7) $BETS added 10 new affiliates in 2015 bringing the total number of affiliates that have signed on with SeanieMac to 142! Since inception the 142 affiliates have given the company 5400 customers who have wagered over $3.3 million dollar and generated a gross profit of close to $200,000. 

http://ih.advfn.com/p.php?pid=nmona&amp;article=65719566 


8) $BETS announces that convertible debentures have been fully converted or purchased for CASH! The company is paying off their debt with cash from operations and non-toxic credit line!

9) The company is voluntarily seeking to reduce their A/S from 2B to only 850M. This almost never happens in the penny land! Almost never happens! According to the 3/12/15 PR - ""The company is continuing to pursue the reduction of its authorized shares and expects the shareholder paperwork to be completed shortly.""

10) As of 4/10/15 and 4/27/15 OS is only 681,302,729 with almost 33M held by the insiders who initially purchased $BETS shares at price above 10c per share! Free trading float is only 648,414,650! T/A is NOT gagged - check yourself. Very attractive share structure for a penny stock!

15-05-07,3583he,Why History Tells Us to Be Bullish On the Market,"My latest article focuses on something David Tepper touched on during his latest speech at the 2015 Ira Sohn Investment Conference, Equity Risk Premiums.  Specifically, I examined the correlation between Forward P/E Ratios and the inverse combination of the U.S. Ten Year Treasury Yields and Dividend Yields in the S&amp;P 500.  I proved the theory to be extremely accurate (it held true 93% of the time over the last 15 years).  After applying the theory to current 2015 metrics, I arrived at the conclusion that one of two things should happen by the end of the year.

Either:

* Yields in U.S. Treasuries rise significantly, OR

* The S&amp;P 500 still has significant upside in the form of multiple expansion.

Ultimately, I arrived at the conclusion that - should the historical theory hold true this year - the S&amp;P 500 Index still has 17% upside between now and the end of the year.

As is always the case, this summary doesn't provide all the important details, so please [read it all here](http://prosperityactiveyield.tumblr.com/post/118372990728/why-history-tells-us-to-be-bullish-on-the-market).

15-05-08,35b3sl,How to convert scientific findings into stock pick?,"There is a ""new"" biomarker, SNTF, that has been identified as a marker of brain injury.  It shows promise with early diagnosis of the types of injury that lead to Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy.  The research is being done by a grouo out of UPenn, and the initial patnt on the work they've done is held by UPenn trustees.


I have a high degree of confidence this biomarker will prove to be of major importance in the next few years.  There's high anxiety about CTE and I believe that shortly there will be field-side point of care testing for SNTF at every NFL, college, and high school football game.  We're looking at a long time horizon, obviously.

Any thoughts on how to convert this confidence in the eventual importance and enormous market for SNTF testing into an investement?

15-05-07,358dwi,"How I'm investing in Dividend stocks. Feedback / Constructive criticism appreciated!","**Disclaimer:**  In terms of investing, I'm as novice as they come.  But, rather than investing everything in a Vanguard dividend fund, I've actually taken to choosing stocks to buy.  Maybe I'll do better, but chances are I'll do worse; I know that, and I don't really advise anyone to follow my particular lead.  However, I'm learning, and actually enjoy researching / building tools, so, at least for now, it's worth it to me.

-----

**What I did:** I compiled a list of a hundred or so dividend stocks that had been recommended by analysts, blogs, and even Reddit users, and wanted to somehow compare them all against each other.  So, I made a website that lists them all, with relevant details, computes a weighted score, and ranks them.

The site is (temporarily) here:  http://goo.gl/oGq70h

Without being able to research, in depth, every single company, as a novice investor, I decided that there were three factors that I cared about:

- Where in the 52 wk range the price is currently
- What the annual dividend yield is (somewhat related to the previous bullet point)
- How many years the company has been increasing the dividend (up to a point; which is why the fourth weight, ""max years,"" is an option)

By tweaking these weights, I can get an idea of which stocks I should be looking at.  I only made this site a week ago, and as you can see, my investments are scattered throughout the spectrum, though in the future, I will be investing in stocks that are closer to the top.

-----

If anyone is curious to play with the site, please do.  I would really like some feedback (constructive, if you please; telling me I'm a know-nothing idiot doesn't really help me get better) on what I'm doing right, what could be doing wrong, and (especially) what weights you find most useful to you.

Thank you!",1

15-05-08,35b98s,"MER, management fees, and waivers/absorbtions. (Vanguard)","Can someone help me out with an interpretation.

I'm not sure about the distinction between MER and Management Fees. Are management fees not included in the MER calculation? I think that's the case, but I can't understand the fine print on Vanguard's Canadian ETF page.

https://www.vanguardcanada.ca/individual/etfs.htm

For MF:

&gt;The management fee is equal to the fee paid by the Vanguard ETF to Vanguard Investments Canada Inc. and does not include applicable taxes or other fees and expenses of the Vanguard ETF. For any Vanguard ETF which invests in underlying Vanguard fund(s), there shall be no duplication of management fees chargeable in connection with the Vanguard ETF and its investment in the Vanguard fund(s).  

For MER:

&gt;The management expense ratio (MER) is the audited MER as of December 31, 2014, including waivers and absorptions and is expressed as an annualized percentage of the daily average net asset value. Vanguard Investments Canada Inc. expects to continue absorbing or waiving certain fees indefinitely, but may in its discretion.

What's going on here? Is the MF part of the MER? Is the MER actually less than the posted value beacuse of these waivers and absorbtions?",1

15-05-09,35dkqs,Seeking advice on feedback on testing methodology for my trading algo.,"I bet hydrocyanide peeks in here, Hi!  His feedback was very helpful the last time i jumped the gun and posted here thinking I ""cracked the code"".  

But i've stuck with it.  I pour over my code top to bottom dozens of times a day looking for any sort of bias.  
Im surprised at how often i think i've nailed it down, and i find yet another little error i overlooked.  
Makes me question my attention to detail.

Now, last time i posted, i learned a lot about in-sample vs out-of-sample data.  And overfitting models.  As well as testing in different market environments.  So I am super paranoid about arbitrary things now.

Here is how i set up my tests. 
I use end of day option data (which i purchased 2.5 years for 150$ worth for 2 underlyings) as well as end of day stock closing data (free).  for my model and back testing.  I bench mark against a known index and the market itself (S&amp;P).  THERE CAN BE NO BIAS HERE RIGHT? (Other than being actual history, theres nothing arbitrary about these facts/data)

Within the date ranges that I have data for, every time i run my test, I randomly choose a start date and an end date that is random but at least 6 months greater than the start date.  This helps me look at the various market environments as well as entry points.   

I also randomly generate a starting account value between $10,000 and $150,000.  I figure this is how much money i could actually apply to this algo, so i might as well be realistic but test at 1500$ intervals between the two numbers.   

i even have trades randomly ""fail"" and not be accounted for .. since i figure sometimes my live api calls will fail.  

Other than that,  my algo is following a set of rules that reacts to market data and trends, 
i have a basic ""unit"" of action that is 1% of my current account value.  Arbitrary, but it what i feel comfortable with.

I purchased the option data from 01/01/2009 - 6/30/2011 ,and ran my model within those dates over and over and refined things.  When it looked like I smoothed out all the technical errors... and still getting good results.  I purchased another 2.5 years to add 1.25 years in front of and 1.25 years after that first date range.  Now i run my tests randomly within those expanded dates.  And it is still performing better than my benchmarks.  I think next I will buy another 2.5 years of option data and test in more expanded range.

Can i be reasonably sure that I haven't blindly introduced any biases.  Or is my testing methods sound?  
I ask because since i've not formally studied this stuff, I was blind to some basic stuff the first time around.  

thanks

15-05-09,35e35s,$Z Should I be sketched out by delayed ER?,"Hey guys,

So I bought some $85 May 15 P in Z a couple days before their initial ER with the expectation that it was going to bomb like Twitter, Yelp, Linkedin, ect.  I was looking at graphs and they all jumped up to absurd prices in the summer of 2013, and all have sequentially crashed during this ER.  Plus they all have these insane valuations when their only main monetization tragedy comes from collecting ad revenue.

However, now I'm sketched out.  $Z delayed their earnings to May 12, in what I feel is a move to ""cook some books"".  I think they knew that the market was going to slaughter them for their shitty ER and did this to buy more time.  I'm new to trading (4 months), so I've never experienced this before.  Is this a common occurrence?  I fear they're bandaging the issue as much as possible so they don't get crushed as hard as they should, or possibly even at all.  

Thanks for any/all input on the matter",0
15-05-08,35caxe,"How I'm investing in Dividend stocks. Feedback / Constructive criticism appreciated!","**Disclaimer:**  In terms of investing, I'm as novice as they come.  But, rather than investing everything in a Vanguard dividend fund, I've actually taken to choosing stocks to buy.  Maybe I'll do better, but chances are I'll do worse; I know that, and I don't really advise anyone to follow my particular lead.  However, I'm learning, and actually enjoy researching / building tools, so, at least for now, it's worth it to me.

-----

**What I did:** I compiled a list of a hundred or so dividend stocks that had been recommended by analysts, blogs, and even Reddit users, and wanted to somehow compare them all against each other.  So, I made a website that lists them all, with relevant details, computes a weighted score, and ranks them.

The site is (temporarily) here:  http://goo.gl/oGq70h

Without being able to research, in depth, every single company, as a novice investor, I decided that there were three factors that I cared about:

- Where in the 52 wk range the price is currently
- What the annual dividend yield is (somewhat related to the previous bullet point)
- How many years the company has been increasing the dividend (up to a point; which is why the fourth weight, ""max years,"" is an option)

By tweaking these weights, I can get an idea of which stocks I should be looking at.  I only made this site a week ago, and as you can see, my investments are scattered throughout the spectrum, though in the future, I will be investing in stocks that are closer to the top.

-----

If anyone is curious to play with the site, please do.  I would really like some feedback (constructive, if you please; telling me I'm a know-nothing idiot doesn't really help me get better) on what I'm doing right, what could be doing wrong, and (especially) what weights you find most useful to you.

I noticed the stock because it trades at a discount to book value and I can't quite figure out why. Although the accounting margins are slim (14.3% gross margin &amp; only 3.5% net margin), the company seems to have been profitable for 4 out of the last 5 years. I thought maybe their book value was inflated, thereby giving a deflated P/B ratio. Indeed, the largest asset on their sheet seems to be Property, Plant, and Equipment making up almost 50% of their net assets. I figure this makes sense for a company that primarily manufactures expensive tech - many oil companies have a higher percentage of assets invested in PPE, but Intel has only 37% invested in PPE. There's also a possibility that the ADR's trade at a discount due to currency concerns. I'm planning on reading their annual report, but it seems like an interesting opportunity at first glance.

I'm curious what is wrong with the following idea. Unfortunately, true index funds are not available in my country, so I've been buying mutual funds for now until I know more.

example investment amount: **€5000**
start date: **March 1, 2015**

As the stock market fluctuates each day/week/month, sometimes my portfolio is slightly over **€5000** and sometimes slightly under. What if I figure out how much my portfolio should be worth due to inflation and just keep taking out whatever is above that?

So say inflation is **2%** per year, so approximately **0.0055%** per day. It's now been **45** days since my initial investment, so it should have a real world value of **€5000 x (1 + 45 x 0.000055) = €5012**.^^1

Let's say that due to the market fluctuating, I actually have **€5050** in my portfolio. What if I take out **€5050 - €5012 = €38** and have that for spending?

In the opposite scenario, the market has gone down and I have **€4950** in my portfolio. Then I don't do anything.

In other words, I only act to skim off the top during the up times.

I imagine there is a flaw with my idea. I would just like to know what it is. Thank you!

WASHINGTON—The stock prices of more than 1,000 small U.S. companies will trade in increments of five cents under a long-awaited plan the Securities and Exchange Commission finalized late Wednesday.

The SEC voted to finalize the highly-anticipated test program that will run for two years beginning next May. It’s designed to determine whether trading the stocks of smaller companies in wider “tick sizes,” or the difference between what traders bid and offer for the shares, will boost interest in the stocks.

The move is a shift from more than a decade of requiring trading in pennies. Wider increments, advocates of the plan say, will allow traders to reap higher rewards, giving them more of an incentive to trade the stocks and lessen volatility. Critics say its goals are aspirational and will accomplish little other than to make trading in certain shares more expensive for investors.

The program will apply to firms with $3 billion or less in market capitalization, down from the $5 billion initially expected.

“The data generated by this important market structure initiative will deepen our understanding of the impact of tick sizes on market quality and help us consider new policy initiatives that can improve trading in the securities of smaller-cap issuers,” SEC Chairman Mary Jo White said in a written statement.

The five-member SEC signed off on the test plan unanimously, according to people familiar with the vote, which wasn’t announced publicly. The vote was conducted in “seriatim” and not in a public meeting.

The program marks one of the first major stock-market initiatives launched by Ms. White, who has been under pressure by lawmakers and others to advance the pilot program after years of discussion.

The SEC last year directed U.S. stock exchanges and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a Wall Street self-regulator, to work together to develop a plan to implement the program. The finalized program will last two years instead of the one year originally envisioned.

It involves three separate test groups, with 400 stocks in each group.

The first test group would have a minimum five-cent trading increment, with no exceptions. The second test group would allow certain exceptions to the five-cent spread, such as so-called midpoint trading, in which orders can be executed halfway between buy and sell orders.

A third test group will be subject to a requirement that certain off-exchange trading platforms provide clients a better price, compared with the best orders in the market, than they currently provide. This “trade-at” rule could help prevent some trading from shifting away from exchange to opaque venues, such as dark pools, because it would be more expensive for firms trading on the venues to provide competitive orders, according to experts.

The SEC scaled back some technical elements of the trade-at bucket. One change makes it harder for traders to get around the trade-at requirements by tweaking the definition of large “block trades” that are exempt from the rule. Under the final plan, block trades are defined as transactions involving at least 5,000 shares or at least $100,000 of shares, down from 10,000 or $200,000 in an earlier proposal.

A fourth control group of stocks would see no change to their quoting and trading.",20

A pattern you see with a lot of these ""traders"" is that they never show you the returns they make from their account. They only show you what they want you to see, which could be manipulated. An example of this could be you make 100 trades in a month and only show the ones you profited on. Websites like profit.ly have an extreme amount of ""profitable"" traders, yet almost none of the trades are verified. 

Example:
-

The reason I make this post is because of this: http://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/35jqa2/what_is_your_opinion_on_this_guy/

&gt;He says for usually $97 a month, right now I think $45, he gives his picks via text and people are making 20% returns. Is this legit? He bought a Lambo recently, and he seems like he is doing quite well with very little losses.

This is exactly why this phase, ""it is too good to be true"" exists. Realistically he most likely rented the lambo for a couple of days, and pretended like he bought it. His ""trades"" might be there, but he isn't showing you the losses. Also isn't it pretty clear that selling a product for only $97 is a little bit cheap? 

To quote /u/GoldenChrysus:

&gt;I'm not one to discredit something because of high returns because I manage a fund with returns that many who don't have insight into my firm have called ""impossible.""
That said, a cursory review of the trades shows an ~88% win rate, which is almost unheard of. Again, it's not impossible, but incredibly unlikely.

This guy is profiting thousands of dollars with percentage returns that not even the top traders in the world can get. Yet is selling you a product for only $97?  That makes no sense.

All you should really do is not ever get greedy. Products like the example above are way **way** too sketchy to be believable. If you wanted to be sure someone is legit, look to see if they post their trades FROM THEIR ACCOUNT. Things like profitly can easily be tampered with if the trade isn't verified.

15-05-11,35melp,Foreign brokerage account for US Person ?,"Hello everyone, 

I don't know if this question is suitable for this sub, but anyway, I thought that some people here might know the answer: 

I am French, and I will (should) move to the US in a few months, working there for a few years. I plan to come back to France at some point. If I understood correctly how Substantial Presence Test, I will certainly be considered as a ""US resident for tax purposes"". I am trying to understand the implications for my investments: 

I have a brokerage account here in France, where I invest mostly in ETFs distributed by European societies (Amundi &amp; Lyxor), that I buy in Euronext Paris. 
I understood that because of FATCA, I'll have to declare this account, and also report the dividends or capital gains to the IRS. Actually, they don't distribute dividends, and, while I don't sell (I buy&amp;hold), I don't really have much to declare. 

However, when reading the documentations associated with these products, each of them contains something like that: 
""More particularly, this site is NOT intended for citizens or residents of the United States of America or for any «U.S. Person» , as this term is defined in SEC Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933. The definition of this term is set forth in the legal terms and conditions of our web site. The investment products described on this web site are not registered under the U.S. federal securities laws or any other relevant U.S. state laws. Consequently, no investment product may be offered or sold directly or indirectly in the United States of America (including in U.S. territories and possessions), to or to the benefit of residents and citizens of the United States of America and to «U.S. Persons». This restriction also applies to residents and citizens of the United States of America and «U.S. Persons» who may view or access this web site while travelling or during a stay outside of the United States of America. If you are an «U.S. Person», agree these used conditions and view the definition of U.S. person into the Legal terms and conditions.""

I am not sure to understand what it means: does it mean that I lose the right to buy/sell or possess these products in my French account while I'll be in the US? It seems weird and very restrictive… 
I prefer to ask now and not in 6 months because if it means I must stop buying / possessing these ETFs, I prefer to know now so I can calmly start to elaborate my strategy to get rid of them (it's not a huge amount, but still...) :(

Your thoughts appreciated.","I understand that technical analysis is incredibly important and consumer satisfaction is a small (if not trivial, unfortunately) part of the fundamental side of how you should evaluate a stock but there are certain companies that just seem to go above and beyond when it comes to not giving a fuck about consumers with little or no retribution.  Regardless of how you feel about the companies themselves, I feel there has got to be an investment opportunity one way or another whether they have proven themselves to be ""bulletproof"" or whether they are bound to fail.  

  One glaring example is Electronic Arts or EA Game as a lot of people know it.  Go on /r/gaming /r/EA /r/EAgames and you will get an idea of how people feel about them (the latter two were actually supposed to be pro EA or at least neutral but there really isn't much positive to post from a customer stand point. With two of their major titles over the last year, FIFA 2015 and NHL 2015, they literally released games that were not only half completed but they actually removed standard functions from previous years promising to release them in ""patches"" that have yet to be seen.  SimCity was a laughable nightmare. Yet over the last two years their stock has gone up 180%.   

  This is just one example of many (Comcast, Lendtree, etc.) where the people that actually use the company are quite vocal about how bad it is yet the company's stock has posted steady continuous gains. What are your thoughts on these type companies? I'm not sure with companies like EA; obviously they have a pretty serious monopoly on sports games so maybe they are bulletproof. They could not possibly have a worse reputation in their respective community. Or maybe it's a stock where you bet against them because you know the consumer can only take so much before they abandon their products all together.

&gt; “The offering documents did not correctly describe the mortgage loans,” Cote wrote in a 361-page ruling Monday. “The magnitude of falsity, conservatively measured, is enormous.”

A judge just ruled today that RBC and Nomura fraudulently misrepresented the loans that they sold to Fannie and Freddie in the years leading up to the crisis. In the ruling (which is binding to future NYC district cases), the judge rejected a few key arguments that critics of F&amp;F have made, saying both that:

1) The requirement of the Government that F&amp;F facilitate loans did not cause the losses on the RBC and Nomura mortgages.

2) The financial crisis itself did not cause the losses on the RBC and Nomura mortgages

The judge ruled that the fraudulent representation did in fact cause financial losses that helped precipitate F&amp;F's distress. A really interesting piece of the puzzle when looking at the causes of the financial crisis, and whether or not F&amp;F should be wound down.

I see that China has lowered the interest rates for the third time in less than a half of year. Due to this and ease of entering stock market, the article says ""[lowering interest rates] have triggered a strong run-up in China's stock markets...concerns over speculative trading"" Lastly, I am also hearing is that the amount of debt that are owned by individuals &amp; companies in China are increasing significantly.

With all these news coming in, what would happen if growth in China slows down, or even bust?? As part of investment strategy, is it possible to ""short"" on something expecting Chinese economy will slow down?

I always thought China market as ""producers"" market, manufacturing large quantities of cheap items, and United States as ""consumers"" market, using a lot of products made in China. So when US economy was weak during the subprime mortgage bust, world economy was hit as well. Can similar event happens when Chinese economy goes down?

15-05-12,35ofyl,How to tell whether the structured settlement buyer you’re dealing with is genuine?,"The annuity that you are receiving as a part of your structured settlement due to some personal injury or as a part of your worker’s compensation may just not work out if you have a sudden need to make some lump sum payments. It could be to make some urgent payments that need to be made otherwise there could be legal penalties or to pay for education or health related issues or to make any other equally important payments that needs a substantial amount- one that you cannot generate from any other avenue. Although the amount that you are receiving as your settlement would normally have been sufficient to cover the expense but because the settlement is being awarded to you structurally in parts as monthly or annual installments, it is difficult to get your hands on to a larger sum of money that you need now. This may just make you make up your mind to sell your structured settlement to another buyer who will in lieu of the settlement amount give you your desired huge amount in one go.

You must check the buyer before agreeing to sell your structured settlement

To ascertain that the settlement buyer that you are dealing with is genuine is difficult but not altogether impossible. It does require to you to file the required papers in the court before you seek to sell your structured settlements. The court will then set a date for you when you will have to appear and you can have an attorney represent you the expenses of which are generally borne by the buying party. You may even have your private attorney alternatively. If the buyer discourages you to have your personal attorney then it is a clear cut signal for you to be worried. Also, the role of the broker’s in getting your structured settlements being sold cannot be neglected. These people have the best of your interests in their hearts and it could be a part of their jobs to look into the profile of perspective buyers who wish to buy your structured settlements as to their credibility and capacity to provide you with the lump sum payments that you need. However, you may use the services of brokers only when there are huge sums involved because even their services come with a price tag. But if you employ their services they are able to get you the best buyers who will pay you a good amount for the sale of your structured settlements and will also take care of all the legal formalities in a way that there can be no way in which the other party can cheat you with your money. Ask for the quote of their services before you commit them to your case.

Few things to know before selling your structured settlements

Normally before the person or company buying your structured settlement offers you any advance against your structured settlement, should you opt to sell it to them; the brokers provide you with ready cash which can get you started in making the pressing payments for which you were selling the settlements in the first place. This also is a part of the services of the brokers and one that they are earnest enough to perform. The skilled representatives of the brokers leave no stone unturned in getting you the best rates from a reliable buying company in no time at all. It is however understood that the amount you will be receiving from the buyer will be lesser than the total value of your structured settlements, all installments put together but this the price that you pay to help yourself in dire circumstances by getting a discounted price for your settlements by selling it to another buyer. The consent of the judge in the legal court is mandatory for such dealings to take place; you will have to cite your reasons before him for selling your structured settlements prematurely. But if you have made sure that the buyers are genuine, you should have no cause for worry while selling the structured settlements yet in any case having a tight proof case with full transparency is best advised so that you are secured legally to receive all the payments that you must receive after selling your structured settlements. The brokers again play a vital role in this regard because their work is not done until you receive the full payment as you were promised.

The conduct of the buyer is proof enough

The amount given to you as decided is dependent on some factors. You may choose to sell full or half of your structured settlements. It is also subjective to the current economic conditions and may have certain additional extras added on to them. The company willing to award you all the money as their prerogative in the most transparent way would most likely be your true savior. As per Richard from (company name), structured settlements should only be sold to credible buyers with good intentions. You may be assisted by brokers during the sale to guide you through the legal proceedings and it is imperative too because the federal law can have an imposition of a 40% excise tax on transactions which are not in accordance with the ‘qualified state statute’ and hence before proceeding any further with the plan, you should ascertain in all ways explained earlier the genuineness of the buyer whom you are selling your structured settlement to.",1

I'm not really understanding inflow quite yet. 

Is inflow a useful tool for timing rebalancing? Is it reliable? As I understand it, inflow can increase for more than ""positive"" reasons, such as unit creation to support shorting.",1

15-05-12,35p1yk,Don’t Short When it Comes to Secular Investing,"In the previous post we covered what you should do in a cyclical bull market. But what do you do (as a secular investor) in a cyclical bear market? Investing in a cyclical bear market is very different from investing in a cyclical bull market.

By the end of a cyclical bull market, you will want to have liquidated all your longs (bullish positions) because the peak is in. Normally, you would go short in order to profit from a market decline if you see that the cyclical bear market is starting.

What Does it Mean to “Go Short”
Normally, buying into an investment is a bullish investment. If the market goes up, you make money. If the market goes down, you lose money.

“Going short”, or “short positions” is exactly the opposite. You’re betting that the market will go down. If the market goes up, you lose money. If the market goes down, you make money.

The concept behind going short is simple. You borrow securities (e.g. stocks) that you don’t own. You sell them at the current price. You buy these securities back in the future at the future price. If the future price is lower than the current price, you just made a profit. If the future price is higher than the current price, you make a loss. Here’s an example.

The current price of Apple is $500 a share. Let’s assume I short 1 Apple stock. If Apple stock falls to $400, I just made a $100 profit (500-400), which is a 20% profit. But if Apple stock rises to $600, I just lost $100 (600-500), which is a 20% loss.

Thus, when you buy (go long) a security, your losses are limited (max. you can lose is 100%), while your gains are potentially unlimited (b/c the stock price can theoretically go to infinity). When you sell (go short) a security, your losses are theoretically unlimited while your gains are limited (if the stock goes to $0, that’s a 100% profit). That’s why a lot of investors don’t like to short stocks – the risk:reward ratio isn’t very attractive.

Shorting is a very different concept. If you buy “long” (bullish) positions, it doesn’t matter if the market goes down. It doesn’t affect your cash positions. You can simply wait (use the time factor) for the market to turn around. But shorting is different. If the market goes against you (goes up), it eats into your cash position. This is known as margin problems. If you have longs and the market declines, all you have to do is wait until the market turns around. This is not true for a short position – you don’t have the luxury of time (waiting for the market to turn around). Here’s an example:

You use 75% of your cash to short Stock A. If the market rises 33% (which eats into your remaining 25% of cash), you’re forced to liquidate your entire short position at the worst price possible.
As you can see, shorting requires your timing to be insanely accurate. Thus, all shorts are essentially just trades – with a time factor involved, shorting and secular investing are incompatible.

Shorts can’t afford time – you can’t wait for the market to turn around in your direction. So what can you do as a secular investor in a cyclical bear market?

Do Nothing
Sorry to break it to you, but in the secular investing strategy, there is nothing you can do in a cyclical bear market to make money. But what you can do is not lose money, which is what happens to most investors in a cyclical bear market. Don’t try to “buy the dips”, because the “dips” often turn into hurricanes that kill all the bullish investors. Instead, all you can do is wait for the market to bottom and wait for the new cyclical bull market to begin.",1
15-05-12,35rd7z,Noob question about Stock splits,"So I was looking at some old stocks I was told to invest in awhile ago and never did just to kinda see what happened to them.

And the reason I see it at $15 is because of stock splitting or something.  

Is the share what he sees or what I see? I do notice a lot of stocks such as google are a lot lower now and back when I was just browsing I saw them at like $1k.   So did the stock splitting affect them too? and did that screw people over since the shares are at half the price or is it all the same in the end? I am so confused haha.

15-05-12,35ro7w,ERX again (now with new hedging),"[My biggest mistake](http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/2ymuae/gentlemen_its_time/) this year was timing the oil bottom just right and getting too antsy selling calls on the week of the last fed meeting.  I made money, but I lost a lot of upside due to that.  The 25k I made should have been 200k.

Since ERX (underlying XLE) has fallen about 10% from its unsustainable highs, I got back in it today.

REASONING:

There's a little dollar weakness showing up (finally) and OPEC also raised demand predictions a bit [today](http://www.cnbc.com/id/102669381).  That coupled with last week seeing the first supply [draw down](http://ir.eia.gov/wpsr/wpsrsummary.pdf) since the crash started hints at oil rounding the bend a bit.  Those coupled with the fact that 'big' oil (which is what XLE is based on) has had two quarters to report all the bad news, and revise earnings estimates accordingly.  With the numbers in hand, XOM and CVX are trading at forward P/Es of 16-17, which is fair based on current market conditions.

As a comparison, the biotech sector (hottest this year) is trading at a trailing P/E of 25, even after a 10% correction.

So I think we're getting to a point where bad oil and gas news just can't get a whole lot worse.  This is reinforced by the sudden bottom -&gt; surge in offshore drillers this past week (RIG, SDRL, RDC).

Does ERX have the ability assuming current market conditions to run from 60-80 like it did from 50-70?  Nope, don't think so.  If OPEC cuts production next month, maybe.  So the idea of being in the stock just to cash in on that sweet, sweet call premium makes more sense now than it did then.

The catch is what happens with a looming market-wide correction?  What if 'big oil' sees another 5-10% decline?   That I think I can handle.  For a week's worth of call premium, I can buy a call spread 2 months out on ERY (the inverse of ERX) at 18/19 (currently trading at 17.50).  So for a week of call premium on ERX, I can have 15% downside in ERX covered two months out.  Owning the stock at 60, I can sell a call a month out for 4 dollars (marking up 2 dollars on the strike), which brings the cost basis to 56, and the upside on the call spread of ERY in case of a dip would bring in another 3 dollars worth of profit, and rolling a monthly call down for another 3 dollars worth would put my cost basis right at 50..or...the price I bought the stock for before its run from 50-70.  Plus I have a standing SPY short call spread with an upside of about 20k...or...another 2 dollars if the above happens.

If a new oil collapse brings the shares back into the 40s, I'm content to own the stock at 50 and just wait it out.  It's not too hard to chase down moves away in a leveraged ETF with covered calls, and we've seen the bottom, imo, it was at ~45.

And additionally I still have a pretty good chunk of cash on the sideline since nothing else looks very attractive from a valuation standpoint, so there's always the option of doubling up if it moves down to lower my basis further.

tl;dr:  10k shares of ERX (again)

15-05-12,35paw4,House Update – Why I’m So Glad I Got An Independent Inspection,"Last week I wrote about why it’s a good thing to get an independent inspection done on your property when building. Today I am going to elaborate on why that’s important.


So last week I arranged for an expert to evaluate our house for defects. He arrived on site on Thursday morning with the intention of only being at the house for around 30-5 minutes – he was there for about 2.5 hours.

Every room we walked through he found faults, many were quite small and easy to fix, other not so much. Unfortunately he also found major faults which have the potential to cause the house to be structurally unsound.

Not being a builder, I had no idea what to look for, but as soon as he pointed things out to me, I immediately saw the problem – and that’s exactly why I hired him to do the work. He knows what to look for – I don’t. So now i’m going to be sending the report onto the builder for them to rectify what’s wrong.

House Inspection Faults

Hopefully they agree to make the changes and there are no major issues, otherwise we may have to go to mediation and then ultimately court. I’m sure neither party really wants that, but you have to be prepared for it just in case. So to that end I am ensuring that I have as much evidence as possible and that I am complying fully with the contract. You don’t want to give them a way out of having to fix everything that’s been found.

 

So what’s actually gone wrong?

For the most part it’s just a bit on the sloppy side, but the major issues are things like holes in structural beams, no support for support beams, walls that are leaning and not upright – none of these things should happen and there is no way it should have gotten through the certification process. So we will have to review the report that the builder did to see how they missed these things.

OREX was getting nuked earlier today by what was mostly a non-story. People like to pile on the bad when shit like this comes out, but the halting of the CVOT trial was expected and desirable, and the new clinical information revealed by the Cleveland clinic is not only not damning, but confirming that OREX doesn't worsen outcomes. OREX does not need to show superiority, but only that the fat loss drug isn't shown to be inferior on the primary endpoint. What the latest news has done was undermine the thinking of idiots that the earlier interim results showing superiority were reliable. They weren't, and never were.

I refuse to believe that the earlier interim results has had any measurable impact on revenue, and so today's earlier news about a vanishing benefit on the CVOT primary endpoint was largely a non-story in my assessment of OREX.

The bigger story is Takeda trying to get out of paying for any of the new CVOT trial. I think this is complete bullshit, and Takeda will never get their wish, otherwise OREX would try to turf the partnership and find another partner willing to help them out. Takeda doesn't get a free pass from all future developmental expenses while hanging onto their current rights, that is absurd, imo. I think this threat may be more related to negotiations between Takeda and OREX wrt EU rights (which, I believe, we still do not know if and who OREX is talking with wrt EU).

Buy on weakness if you like OREX, this shit-storm will have no impact on revenue, and I think the likelihood that OREX has to take on additional CVOT expenses seems extremely unlikely.",5

15-05-12,35pjlb,[DL] Spreadsheet for tracking investments,"Hi all!


I've recently started out in the share market (a long time lurker of this sub), but I couldn't find much on day-to-day stock tracking, so I decided to create my own using spreadsheets. 

***What is it?***

It's essentially an efficient spreadsheet in tracking all of your stocks; all you have to do is input the closing stock price each day and it'll calculate change, profits, totals, as well as overall totals for the latter two automatically, so you can see how your stocks are going on a day-to-day basis. The data can then be manipulated into graphs, if you're into those kind of things. 

Here is an example company filled out: http://i.imgur.com/vnPJ3et.png

I've been interested in it for almost a year now and just now at the age of 16 Im  starting to seriously looking at it. I've played around with practice Forex accounts and been looking at companies to invest in, well what im trying to say is; This review is from a total new comer to investing. 


Although written in the 1940's this book stood the test of time. Its points still stand today. The Hypocrisy and Folly of wall street is told in a humorous manner and shows the dark side of wall street which would be hidden to a naive young person like me ! It gets the point across very well, to me anyway, that people drawn to the stock market are people who want to 'out smart' everyone and become rich. They are also helpless romantics...towards the market, which (speaking for myself here) I cannot deny. It speaks of how the brokers sometimes use unsavory tactics to get investors to buy their stock, but also speaks of how the investors are willing to buy this stock in a bid to get rich. Schwed wrote the book in a tongue and cheek fashion with a cynical sense of humor. Although, at first I did not know all the terms he used so it may not have been intended for a new comer but after research I know them now. All in all, from the perspective of a person who is new to the area it is very good for painting a picture of wall street which may not be seen by the public eye and will give you a fresh vision on the market. For me personally it pushed me even further to go into Brokering and such.

15-05-13,35se3h,Intraday Setup - The Fader,"Basically my favorite style of trading is joining on the trend of a slow fade. You barely have any headache and are not scared out of the trade. One of the biggest things to look out for in this ""fading"" setup is lower highs. Most of the time the stock will put in a base (support) at whole/half dollar marks. 
Here is an example of a stock today with a fantastic fading setup:
http://i.imgur.com/lY3MMkG.png

As you can see, the stock put in a lower high multiple times while holding support. If you want to play it safe wait for it to break first. If you are confident and want a better position, get short anticipating the break and fade. It is pretty common for stocks to fake a breakdown so playing it safe is almost always the better option. 

However, things change when the stock is super low float (pretty much lower than 3 million float). Look at GENE, PTBI, and VLTC. They faked out so many times and kept squeezing. When the fading setup occurs on them, try to avoid trading it until it is past 3:00.


OTC example:
http://i.imgur.com/q2nTxs9.png

I have no idea what it is but OTC stocks are so much cleaner. As you can see, it held support then cracked. This crack normally doesn't always mean it will washout, sometimes it will fakeout and that is when you will have to cover. With this stock, it literally followed every trend possible for a huge 10%+ washout!


**Stocks tend to really drop when:**

* It is breaking a whole/half dollar mark it normally holds

* goes red on the day

* it has been up a lot without much pullback (on the daily chart)

* it breaks past 3:00

* it isn't a crowded trade

* a combination of these things usually makes a bigger selloff/drop.


Good luck!

This is a known phenomenon where the public gets excited about a new technology and the price skyrockets...  Only for people to realize that moon isn't coming tomorrow.  
  
So the price falls.  
  
But the work keeps on happening behind the scenes.  And the foundations get stronger.  Eventually a sharp price correction upward rectifies things.  
  
For these companies to have a P/E in the low double digits is absurd.  This is manufacturing technology that will change the entire world from a corporate level down to a household level.  
  
But be aware that I'm not saying to buy in now.  The stock market is testing through new peaks every week, and no one knows when we will face a major correction.  I don't know how hard a crash will hit the 3D printing sector since they are already quite depressed, but I'm sure that a major collapse in equities won't look kindly on speculative technology like this.   
  
But these stocks **definitely** need to stay on your radar.  
  
They may provide some of the best investing returns of our lifetimes once the technology catches up with the hype (soon), and once we return to a more rational price for stocks (soonish).

It started dropping from  $22 and I planned to buy it when it fell to $16. But it stopped at $17 and shot back up to $24 within two weeks (~ 20% returns). I missed this !
Another stock I had been holding - I had bought it at $150 and planned to sell it around $250. It hit $247 and then came back and I am still waiting for it to reach $250.

I sometimes feel I should be flexible in my targets but there's a dilemma.
In the first case had I been flexible enough to buy it at $17 and it had went back from $18 then what could I've done ?! There is no way for me to know prior how much flexibility I need to have.

15-05-13,35ss2l,FSCLX vs FSEMX: Which one to choose for long term capital growth?,"Hello,

I have only started investing since a year. I have made the rookie mistakes of investing in Mutual Funds based on past performance. I started reading ""Common Sense Investing"" &amp; "" ""Bogleheads Guide to Investing"", and realized that the best way to invest was through Indexing. So, I have pulled out all money (not that much, since I just started working) and shifted to index funds. I have already chosen and put some money in fidelity spartan 500 fund. However, I also want to chose another fund that focuses on Mid-cap &amp; small-cap fund. 

I am stuck between choosing [FSCLX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/316146299) &amp; [FSEMX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/315911503). Both of them look equally good to me. FSCLX is strictly midcap-core and follows Russell Midcap index, but FSEMX is both midcap &amp; smallcap growth. 

Which one of these is better in long term for capital growth?

I am not a value investor despite what masters have said. I fundamentally believe in growth, so I am more inclined to FSEMX. But again, it would be nice to hear out opinions from others.

15-05-13,35t2m0,Thinfilm and World Customs Organization team to bring NFC to the fight against global counterfeiting and piracy,"**Thinfilm provides first NFC solutions for inclusion in WCOs IPM
Anti-Counterfeiting Tool**

OSLO, Norway, May 13, 2015 -Thin Film Electronics ASA(Thinfilm) (OSE:
THIN.OL; OTCQX: TFECY), a leader in the development and commercialization of
printed electronics and smart systems, today announced that its NFC products
will be the first NFC-based solutions to be included in the World Customs
Organization (WCO) IPM anti-counterfeiting tool.

The WCO selected Thinfilms NFC OpenSense(TM) and NFC Barcode(TM) products,
printed smartphone-centric NFC (near field communication) tags that enhance
brand security, in order to enable a wider range of product protection than
otherwise possible. The Thinfilm tags are unique in that they deliver both
ease-of-use and high security levels through a commonly available reading
device - an NFC-enabled smartphone, tablet or industrial reader - and do not
require special hardware or infrastructure. With 179 member countries, the
WCO is the international authority on customs-related matters. WCO provides
the best available tools to combat counterfeiting and piracy around the
world. IPM is a global database that enables rights holders to provide
customs officers with real-time data on their products.

Counterfeiting is a major global problem that impacts a range of industries
including pharmaceutical, technology, food and beverage, retail and more,
with 92 percent of Fortune 500 companies affected, said Davor Sutija, chief
executive officer for Thinfilm. We believe NFC OpenSense can play a
significant role in helping the WCO to combat illicit trade and the growing
threat it poses to our society and economy.

NFC OpenSense and NFC Barcode tags both deliver thin, flexible, cost-effective
protection with smartphone-centric NFC readability. In addition, NFC
OpenSense tags are readable before and after product opening. Unique
identifiers within each Thinfilm OpenSense tag support enhanced product
authentication by identifying if a seal has been broken anywhere along the

On a morning like today, when the SPX gaps down 17 points by the time we wake up in the United States, due to any number of concerns in Europe or Asia, the first thought that may come to an investors mind is – How is my portfolio going to be affected ? And the second thought may seem to be comforting if you’ve set up Stop Losses for your stocks. But this is a false sense of comfort.
 
I had written an earlier post a few years ago, reflecting on the events of the infamous “Flash Crash” day and what exactly happened on that day. That post is replicated here, and provides some deep insights into how Stop Losses work, and why investors should not take comfort in Stop Losses. Most importantly, you’ll always hear money managers tout the use of Stop Losses as some perfect loss prevention mechanism. In reality, it is anything but. Take a read on what happened on Flash Crash day and what happened to investors who had places Stop Loss orders. This post below is from a couple years ago.

15-05-13,35tbin,5 Retail Marketing Ideas,"Some retailers think that marketing services will cost them a lot of money. That’s one reason most of them take the newer marketing ideas for granted and stick to traditional ones. But this can be learned and can be practiced well without spending a dime.

Offer something free

If you have time and budget, you may want to produce some items that have your shop name and address on it and give them away for free. Some examples are pens, t-shirts, calendars, or samples of the products you’re selling. You may include business cards, flyers, and brochures as well.

Offer discounts

Think of something that customers can buy at a discounted price. Offer a discount on products that rarely goes down in price. This will attract customers even more. It will increase your sales and at the same time, your customers can save some cash for other stuffs.

Offer something exciting

Try raffle draw contests. Set some guidelines of how customers can be eligible for the raffle draw and offer exciting prizes. You don’t need to have an extravagant prize. You could offer gift certificates to winners or some items that they can use inside the household. You may also opt for cash prizes.

Maximize the internet

Since almost everybody has a computer at home, it’s easy for consumers to place their orders online. You may want to create your own website that will showcase your products and services. You can engage in forums and blog posting to talk more about your business and what it has to offer.

Make use of your community

By joining some charitable unions or donating to charity works, you make an impression that your business is not only after your customer’s money. Conducting a community service once in a while will make your business visible and easy to trust.

Always make sure that your good retail marketing ideas always complements a high standard of customer service. And you will see results in so little time.",1

I've heard of a few companies, but I want to know if there are any out there that I haven't heard of that may be setting benchmarks or how you feel about the current companies involved in charge charging. I'm specifically looking for any companies outside the US as the sale of electric cars in the EU has increased by 58% in Q1 in comparison to Q1 of last year (http://insideevs.com/european-union-electric-car-sales-58-q1-2015/). 

US companies may be good as well as there is still a growing number of electric car sales in the US, but this is a relatively small % gain as compared to other countries (US sales have increased only 2.74% over the first 4 months of the year in comparison to last year http://insideevs.com/monthly-plug-in-sales-scorecard/). 

The only companies I know are CCGI and obviously TSLA, but I haven't been able to get too much information on how CCGI actually gets their money and am hesitant to invest in them as they don't seem to be into sharing their financial results as of late.

15-05-12,35qhde,AOL -vs- YHOO,"One can loosely consider AOL and YHOO to be in the same boat.
Given today's AOL deal, can one derive a more fair market price for YHOO?

Here's what I'm thinking. AOL's revenue (ttm) was $2.7B. YHOO's was $4.7B. Therefore, using the same metrics as what VZ used for AOL, one can assign Yahoo's core business a value of (4.7/2.7  * 4.4B) or  $7.66B. Yahoo's ""Yahoo Japan"" stake is worth about $9B (before taxes)^[1] . Yahoo has cash on hand of $5.2B. And finally, there's BABA: Yahoo's 15% stake is worth $32B. Add it all up, and it's 7.66 + 9 + 5.2 + 32 =~ $54B. Thus, YHOO should be around $57.6 right now; whereas it is $44. What gives?

15-05-13,35thxu,Who wants to short Japan?,"For those of you who don't know, Japan has 220% debt to gdp, an aging population, declining workforce and uses nearly half its tax revenue just to service debt on ultra low interest rates. As the government continues to issue more debt, the central bank has stepped in to create new currency and buy bonds and now buys 70% of all new bond issuance.  Two scenarios seem likely to play out for the foreseeable future:

1. The central bank continues to print more currency and buy government bonds and the Yen weakens against the dollar and commodities like gold. You could short the Yen against the dollar and gold or borrow in Yen like Mark Cuban who currently has all the Dallas Maverick's debt in Yen.

2. Seeing the currency that they are being paid back in decline, holders of Japanese debt sell their bonds, causing prices to fall and yields to rise. Japan is then forced to either raise rates to entice foreign creditors (which will increase the interest they pay) or default on their debt. Shorting Japanese government debt is the likely play there.

I've found numerous resources below that explain the situation further and give investing advice on how to take advantage of it.

15-05-13,35ulm9,NIOBF discussion,"New to the sub and rdy to lose all my money with you guys. Goal is to hit millionaire status by next month with 1k capital. 

I wanna start a discussion on NIOBF, since 100% of my portfolio is in it. What are your thoughts on it? Will massive returns take years and years? Will it die a sad death? Below is my amateur analysis because I don’t understand how money works.

What I know: this company owns the rights to the Elk Creek mine located somewhere in the Midwest. I’m not sure what state because who cares about the Midwest. What matters is that this mine seems to contain the largest and purest deposits of niobium that we know of, in the world. We currently import 100% of our niobium from other countries (mostly Brazil) because we need a red-blooded Republican in office whose motto is drill, baby, drill.

Niobium is used to strengthen steel and turn it into a superalloy. I think. Listen, the science is complicated and I failed chemistry in high school but apparently this does something. We use this in jets, cars, to strength structures, etc. China is also starting to incorporate minimums into their buildings so earthquakes don’t ruin their shit. Sorry Nepal.

I’m currently sitting on a 136% gain with the stock at .75. It spiked up to the mid $1’s a month or two ago because 60 Minutes did a story on rare earths, but it settled back down. I probably should’ve sold, but I stopped checking my brokerage account for months and missed out.

In the pre-crisis days, this would have been mitigated by banks’ willingness to purchase what the ETF providers are looking to sell, but in the post-Dodd-Frank world this isn’t the case so the idea now is that bank credit lines will essentially allow the ETF providers to become their own dealers, meeting redemptions with borrowed cash while warehousing assets and praying waiting for a more opportune time to sell.

15-05-14,35wr1e,How I invest in Lending Club (x-post /r/personalfinance),"I originally posted this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/35rjnp/lendingclubcom_good_idea_or_bad_idea_to_invest/cr8jn5l?context=3). Your mileage may vary so don't take my word for any of this, do your own research and figure out what works for you if you.  
.  
Currently, I have 104 notes, that are live (so excluding fully paid and not yet issued notes). I have $25 in each note ($2600 total) and they are all current right now. My Net Annual Return is 10.85%. As a caveat, I should note that they are all fairly young notes so that **will** change in the future.   

 I use two methods to determine what notes are purchased through the automated investment system:  

* First, is the grade distribution, which the system unfortunately does not let you override, even though my filter is set in a way that largely makes it irrelevant (my filter is strict enough to pretty much eliminate all D,E,F, and G notes)  
  Because I can't use my filter to set distribution I have had to constantly tweak my percentages to allow me to get new notes that fit my criteria as they come available. That admittedly sidesteps/weakens the diversification element achieved through LC's rating system; however, I have confidence in my filter so I feel comfortable doing so. I would only recommend tweaking your ratings constantly if you know the risk and know what you are doing.  
  
 * My current distribution of note grades is set to:   
 * A: 17%
 * B: 40%
 * C: 43%  

* Secondly, is my filter. I'm just going to go down the list and write out how I have it set with brief footnotes. Any settings that I don't mention are unchecked if they're checkmark boxes or otherwise left at their default (unless it's something I obviously forgot, in which case call me on it).  
.  
.  

* Initial listing status: Both    

&gt; Unless you are investing a fantastical amount of money, you aren't going to be investing in whole loans, and even then, it's probably not advisable from a diversification standpoint. I gather that whole loan notes are fairly uncommon anyway.  

 * Months since last record: 60  
&gt; Public records are things like bankruptcies and defaults. Setting this high weeds out the loans from people shown to be a bad bet when previously being given credit.  

 * Inquiries in the last 6 months: 5    
&gt; Certain actions, such as looking into getting a new car loan, credit card, or mortgage can shoot this number right up since it counts hard inquiries (such as inquiries to get a new line of credit or increase an existing line of credit). If you set this too low then you will remove a whole bunch of otherwise good loans; however, you don't want people who are just racking up credit and burning through it.  

 * Monthly income: 0 to &gt; 20,000  
&gt; Might be a little controversial, but income != ability to repay, especially when other filters are in place to limit how much credit the borrower has and is using at a time. This is another slightly redundant filter because of the other filters and the affect on the number of available loans should be measured before raising this too much.   

 * Total credit lines: 10 maximum  
&gt; See the open credit lines section before for more on this, but this is to catch people who quickly open and close credit lines. There can be legitimate reasons for this being high, especially since accounts stay on the report for 7 years + 180 days (delinquent and collected accounts) or 10 years (accounts closed in good standing), but too many credit lines on the credit report is a major red flag for me.

 * Listing expires in: Any  
&gt; IMO not a relevant factor  

 * Loan purpose: Consolidate debt 
&gt; Unlike other loan types this loan is not increasing the borrower's debt, nor does it increase their spending. In fact, quite the opposite. Everything I have read has led me to believe that this is the the lowest risk loan type to invest in.  

 * Credit score: 660 to 850   
&gt; I tried tweaking this, and I may again at some point, but all increasing it did was exclude most if not all of the possible loans. Credit score also lags behind reality, as in, by the time that someone's credit score is hit, they've already been a risk, hurt their credit from that risk, and tried to move on. Along with the fact that I'm doing debt consolidation loans, using other factors such as public records, inquiries, number of credit lines, , derogatories, and utilization to weed people out seems to work better.  


 * Public records: exlude loans with public records   
&gt; May or may not be redundant with months since last public record, depending on public records falling off of credit reports. This is pretty much a fail safe to stop loans from getting through with older bankruptcies or defaults that are still on the borrower's record.  

 * Funding progress: 0%  
&gt; This is **minimum** funding percentage. Because of the other checks in my filter, plus the checks that Lending Club has in place before a loan is issued, I don't mind being one of the first people in on a loan. I don't have a benchmark to compare with, but a fairly high percentage of loans that I fund get issued. That's a good thing IMO because it means that Lending Club is weeding out, for whatever reason, many loans and the consensus of other users (through automated investing and/or filters and/or manually selecting loans) works to each lender's advantage too.

 * Min length of employment: 5 years   
&gt;  Ask pretty much anyone who extends credit, this is a biggie because it shows income stability and it lends itself to the idea that the person, barring some unforeseen event, will be bringing in money to pay back the loan  

 * Exclude relisted loans: exclude relisted  
&gt; Don't want the returns, if a loan has been rejected then I'm not interested. I'm not sure what constitutes a relist to Lending Club so it's possible that this catches some loans that were relisted for a typo or some other innocuous reason.  

 * Major derogratory: &gt; 60  
&gt; This is months since the last major derogatory mark (which seems to be 90 or more days over due) on the borrower's credit report.  

 * Open credit lines: 0 to 10  
&gt; Per the total credit lines option, more lines of credit = more risk and a higher chance that yours will be the bill that's put off or not paid.  Looking at the statistics on CreditKarma, a lot of people have a large number of credit lines open (you actually get a slight credit boost from having more credit open, as long as your utilization is good and you pay on time). This is something I wish could be tweaked down, but doing so pretty much kills the number of loans.  

 * Location state: all  
&gt; IMO, not particularly relevant to anything. Even if there was a sudden wave of defaults in one state, it would be too late at that point and not investing in that state's loans would have minimal to no effect.  

 * Max loan amount up to: 35,000  
&gt; IMO, not relevant because delinquincies, credit balance, and utilization, among other factors, negate the slightly higher risk from bigger loans.  

 * Delinquincies (last 2 yrs): 0   
&gt; Should be pretty self explanatory, probably redundant with derogatory marks and records filters.  

 * Revolving credit balance: less than $50,000  
&gt; Credit without a fixed rate repayment, so this doesn't include car loans or mortgages but it does include credit cards and home equity credit. This is a big one and I could probably tighten it up even more.  

 * Home ownership: any  
&gt; I tried tweaking this, it just caused problems. In this day and age, many people rent by choice because it makes more economical sense so there isn't necessarily a correlation between renting and higher risk.  

 * Exclude loans invested in: √  
&gt; Self explanatory, I invest $25 per loan for a reason so I don't want to invest in the same loan twice.  

 * Max debt-to-income ratio: 30%  
&gt; Another one I tried to tweak down with various consequences. More debt = more risk, yet again so it's good to get people who are bringing in more income than they have debt. Obviously this doesn't equal free income, because the borrower can still be spending a lot of their income on month to month expenses, but it means they aren't taking on excessive debt.  
  
 * Loan term: 36 month  
&gt; This is a personal choice based entirely on what I feel comfortable with. I've thought about dabbling in 60 month loans, but a shorter loan means fewer payments to start with for the borrower (allowing them hopefully a greater chance to pay off early) and a shorter time for them to potentially get into trouble.  

 * Months since last delinquency: 60 months or more  
&gt; Per the above related items, I don't want anything to do with borrowers who have shown themselves to be credit risks in recent history. Since Lending Club gives us no better way to determine if the borrower is still a credit risk, it is best not to take the chance that they are still having issues.  

 * Interest rate: all  
&gt; Irrelevant due to the other criteria pretty much excluding D and lower loans. I kept my distribution settings to allow D loans when I first started and zero came up as meeting my filter criteria so I'm reasonably sure that this isn't an issue.  

 * Earliest credit line: 10 years or more  
&gt; In conjunction with the rest of the history based filters, this is using the very limited tools Lending Club makes available to get a picture of the person's credit history. It's tough to get comfortable with a person being a credit risk or not based on a short credit history.  

 * Collections excluding medical: 0  
&gt;  Again, eliminating people with credit issues on their account.  

 * Revolving balance utilization: any  
&gt; I had to double check this because I was sure I had it set to something but if I remember correctly, from my testing it was somewhat mitigated by the fact that I have debt to income and other filters that catch high utilization borrowers. I will be revisiting this one though.",1

15-05-13,35velf,"Being a landlord, the good, the bad, the ugly","Yesterday, I received an email from my tenant, asking if she could buy a new vacuum cleaner. This is the third one that would be bought for that property, in four years. I don’t know how long your vacuums last at home, but I think my mum has had the same one for over 10 years. Sure, there are four people living in the property and any item will get heavier wear and tear than if I just rented to a single person, but replacing something when you don’t even live on the same continent is a bit of a pain. And I was informed that the bath tub had some mold, a window didn’t close properly, and a few other news a landlord always dreads to listen. So to put things into perspective, here is a list of good and not so good things about rental properties.

 

The good
 

Money!! That is why you are in in the first place, so yes, it is really nice to see the money come into your account every month. Especially if you managed to get a good rental yield, and if your tenants, like mine, pay by wire transfer, you know the money will come, and it will cover the bills and then some.

 

Almost passive investment. Owning a rental is almost a passive investment. You can make it fully passive by hiring a property manager for a small fee. Except in my town that fee was above 20%, and when you take off the taxes on top, well, that’s a lot. So far I have managed to oversee everything from abroad, mainly thanks to perfect tenants.

 

Building equity. Not only are you receiving a little bit of money every month, you are also paying off a mortgage, or more exactly, your tenants are paying for it. In 20 years, you will be the owner of a property someone else paid for. I guess even your parents didn’t give you such a nice gift.

 

 

The bad
 

Wear and tear. So far this year we have had a broken heater, a broken washing machine that was first fixed then replaced, a broken vacuum and a few minor items. Total was over $1,000, which is a good chunk of profit, although it is tax deductible. You should account for wear and tear when you crunch your numbers before buying a rental.

 

Not so passive investment. Being a landlord is mostly passive, until it is not. What I dread most are vacancies. I need to put ads online, pre-screen potential tenants, then ask the current ones to meet with them for interviews and let me know the one they liked best, as they will be roommates, I have learned from being one myself at some point that it is better to put in someone the others will get along with or you are bound for disasters. When something breaks, you have to go on site, or pay an arm and a leg for someone to do it for you (my solutions, when tenants can’t DIY), eating up your rental profits.

 

Taxes. Although you can offset part of the wear and tear, and depending on where you live, the interests of your loan from the mortgage, rental income is usually taxed pretty high. Get together with an advisor to see if it is more profitable to operate your rentals under a limited company or any other setup that will help you lower your tax burden.

 

 

The ugly
 

Catastrophes. It happened to me as a tenant, my place got flooded, the roof started leaking all over my stuff and there was so much water the neighbor below also got flooded. It was a national disaster and insurance companies were overwhelmed, so my landlord didn’t get back much, just enough to fix the roof, but was still out of pocket to replace the carpet and paint the walls. Double, triple check how well insured you are, because when something happens, it can cost you thousands.

 

Bad tenants. They are the worst part of it all. When my tenant died in Paris, he had been paying his rent on and off for 9 years, but I always had landlord insurance like CIA insurance, and they paid in his place then dealt with him to get the money. When his widow stopped paying for 18 months and her eviction took that long, they paid too. They covered a cleaning of the place and took out all the trash they had hoarded for 10+ years. But the place was still a mess, in dire need of repairs after 10 years of bad treatments. I may moan about my UK tenants being needy but at least they help me keep the place in good shape, whereas the other ones didn’t let me in or make contact for years. Bad tenants are more than people who do not pay. Imagine they set your property on fire, or break all windows just because they fancy! It will take more than their deposit to cover your losses.

Is this an advantage of bond funds over individual bonds?,"For IL, for example, The tax form starts with the AGI from the Federal form, which includes interest income and ordinary dividends.  There is no place to add back qualified dividends.

If I held individual bonds, though, that would be ordinary interest, right?  So, owning a bond fund has the advantage of not being taxed by the state, among its other virtues.  Is this the correct understanding?

So then, regarding the ordinary dividends, should I be able to calculate the portion of the ordinary dividends that were from bonds that are exempt from state tax, like US Treasury bonds, and deduct that?

There is a section where you deduct interest from such exempt bonds.  Perhaps it would be a trivial amount of savings, but curious if I would be entitled to do so.

15-05-13,35vvla,This seems like free money. These two fundamentally sound stocks are trading below their liquidation value.,"Gulf Resources Inc. (GURE) and SGOCO Group Ltd. (SGOC) both have positive earnings per share, and their most recent annual returns on capital are in positive territory, with average returns for capital over the past ten years in double digits.  

A conservative estimate of GURE's liquidation value (based on net current asset value, in case book value isn't conservative enough) puts it at $4.39 per share.  That means that, if the company were to declare bankruptcy, investors can expect a distribution of $4.39 per share after the company's debts are settled..  Today's closing price was $2.49 per share.

SGOC's net current asset value is $2.04 per share.  Today's closing price was $0.50.

So today I bought about $1,500 of each company.  I'm trying to figure out how this isn't free money.  They have excess returns on capital above their WACCs, and their tangible book values have increased over the last fiscal year.  So their values aren't shrinking.  Both companies have been buying back shares over the past year, so this isn't a dilution scam

It seems like the only risk is that they're committing fraud with their financial statements, but if that's the case I could just sign my name onto the class action lawsuit and get my money back with interest.

I just set a limit order for both at their NCAVs, and should make $10k, even if both stocks go bankrupt.

is stock promotion. Just so you guys can get a feel for what it looks like. A key thing to notice in most stock promotions is to see what kind of claims they throw out. In this one, he claims the stock will go over .50 (92% gain!) and also be in walmart. ~~Also he photoshopped/IE an image and claimed they already put their drinks in their stores.~~ (The link does exist but it has been on walmart for months, he made it out like it was just put up). While they are selling drinks on walmart, it means nothing when it is impossible to find without the direct link. Those kinds of claims are simply just unrealistic. Just make sure you do your own research and not to fall for stock promotion. Also just because everyone else is saying one thing, doesn't mean you have to follow it. This ""herd"" mentality in the stock market is super bad and I see too many people get trapped into it.

Good luck.

15-05-14,35xkki,Clear up Trailing Stop Buy order for me please?,"Hi, I'm a bit of a newbie and trying to get a grasp on the different order types, I hope this is the right subreddit to ask. I did read up on the order descriptions, but am not sure I got it right entirely. Specifically, about the Trailing Stop Buy.

So I got this stock I'd like to buy but think it's overpriced right now; for simplicity's sake let's say it's at 110 right now and I'd pay 100... or less obviously so IIUC the TSB order is for me, so I set up a stop-buy limit of 100.

Now in the description it says ""and a trailing stop signifying the difference to the current stock price"". So if I set that to 2%, the stock drops to 90, then goes up again 2%, the order is executed, correct?

But what does ""current"" mean exactly? Off the ""current"" 110, off the limit (in this case 100), or off the lowest price the stock was at? So will I buy at 92.2, 92.0, or 91.8?

The 91.8 makes most sense to me, but it sounds from the description it's the 92.2. Or if the stock drops to 50, buy at 52.2 which would require it to go up nearly 5% again, not the 2% I was giving.",1

So I moved to USA (Los Angeles) last year to work for a company. My boss sold the company to Venture Capital Investors and I got $50,000 bonus, already after taxes.

The new investors also gave me stocks of the newly formed company. They plan is to increase it's value and sell it in 3-5 years. If that happens, I will get another bonus for that stocks, I estimate around $100,000 after taxes.

The thing is I don't know what to do with those $50k I just got. I will probably not retire in USA, so I do not want to put it in retirement accounts. My company does not match any 401 or any of that stuff either.

I am not planning to buy anything in next 3-5 years, I have no debt at all.

I found a wife in USA and we live together now.

This is our budget:

take home together - $5900

rent together - $1600

car insurance for 2 cars - $170

gas for 2 cars - $150

payments on her car - $400 (0% interest)

2 phones - $70

internet at home - $25

no cable

We spent a lot on food and eating out. I don't really know how much but it's a lot. My first goal is to find out and budget it, because we have a lot to save there.

She bought very expensive car which she shouldn't few years ago when I still didn't know her, and she still owes around $13k on it, but she got 0% interest loan on that. And we don't want to use this bonus on that.

I want to wait for the bonus I should get in 3-5 years and then maybe buy a house. Until then I want to get at least 5-6%/yr on those $50k so they don't sit in savings account

Or maybe we won't buy the house at all and we could use also the other bonus for investing, I really don't know yet.

My question is whether it would be better to put all of this new extra money into paying off my car loan as fast as possible or would it be better to take the $3500 and invest it, then pay the $500/month into that investment.

I have seen through some research that an ""average"" return of investments would be about 6%, obviously more than the 5% interest on my car loan. So to my ignorant mind, it seems like investing it would give a (potential) %1 growth over the 30 months.

Also, would the answer of which is better change if the term changed? As it could be 3 years, 10 years or 40 years. I've read that the 6% is over a gradual time period, so I'm wondering if a 3-5 year term would be riskier for having a higher than 5% return?",13

15-05-14,35zzm9,VXUP (the first spot VIX tracker) begins trading on May 19,"http://blogs.barrons.com/focusonfunds/2015/05/14/a-better-mousetrap-for-the-vix-were-about-to-find-out/

&gt; Brace yourselves for VIX-tracking ETFs that actually will track the CBOE Volatility Index.

&gt;    AccuShares Investment Management will launch the first in a series structurally novel exchange-traded funds on Tuesday, May 19, the firm’s co-founder, Ned Cataldo, tells Barron’s. They are designed to track the so-called “spot” prices of volatility and, eventually, commodities. The first pair you’ll see next week are the AccuShares Spot CBOE VIX Up Shares (VXUP) and the AccuShares Spot CBOE VIX Down Shares (VXDN).

&gt;    Let’s be clear. These aren’t for everybody. But it’s a launch worth watching for traders who have dabbled in ETFs that track VIX or commodity futures before. The new ETFs won’t look like anything on the market, and could give traders a means to circumvent some pitfalls associated with holding ETFs that own futures over the long time — if they work.

&gt;    The key is the word “spot” in their titles. AccuShares funds own cash and cash equivalents; investors buy into either the “up” or “down” shares and effectively get a credit (or debit) in the middle of each month in cash (or shares) that corresponds with moves in the VIX.

&gt;    That’s fundamentally different from existing products, which own futures. Here’s the problem AccuShares is aiming to solve: futures prices can veer sharply from “spot” prices over the long term. For instance, the iPath S&amp;P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX) is down about 99.7% since it hit the market in 2009. Same goes for the ProShares Ultra VIX Short- Term Futures ETF (UVXY) and others.""",19

I'm not active in this sub, but I'm aware of the Vanguard nuclear level circle jerk about these guys. But here's the thing - I have a couple ETFs with them through TD in my IRA, but I'm totally ignorant about how it is to work with them direct. My dad truly needs a 100% hands off approach. I know it's ridiculous for those that manage their own shit, but I'm sick to my stomach thinking that he might take the EJ bait just because they have the attitude of ""don't worry, just give us the money"". 

I made the recommendation, but is Vanguard honestly competing with the EJ's of the world in terms of personal advisement? He needs someone to talk to. Not someone to talk to every day, just someone to set him up in the right way, and just have my dad passively contribute. 

Any other recommendations are of course welcome. I have my ways, he has his (sort of). I'm just very protective and don't want him to screw this up just because someone's sweet talking him into a less than advantageous situation.

I didn't quite believe that advice, so I decided to test it myself! My goal was to understand what leveraged index ETFs were likely to return in comparison to their non-leveraged counterparts using the entire history of the stock market, specifically for the S&amp;P 500.

First, I scooped the S&amp;P daily changes off of Quandl. Then, I whipped up some code in MATLAB that calculated the return for every possible holding period (bought and held from day A to day B). Then I calculated the mean, median, and 25%/75% percentiles for the return for holding periods of X years. Here is a plot of the return for a hypothetical index ETF and its 2x leveraged counterpart for various holding periods.

[Graph of S&amp;P](http://i.imgur.com/oXil2lH.png)

As you can see, the lowest 25th percentile of the index and leveraged ETFs roughly coincide at early years, and then the leveraged ETF takes off at longer periods. Also in these shorter periods, the median leveraged ETF roughly coincides with the 75th percentile of the index ETF.

My assumptions were based around two current S&amp;P 500 ETFs: SPY and SSO. As such, my non-leveraged ETF has an expense ratio of 0.1% and a dividend yield of 2.0%, compounded daily. The leveraged ETF had an expense ratio of 0.9% and a dividend yield of 0.75%.

In short, if the stock market follows the patterns of the last 60 years, 2x ETFs are actually pretty good bets for long-term holding.

However, [if we look at the data for the DJIA](http://i.imgur.com/apXzMSn.png), which runs from 1896 - 2015, the results are a little more gloomy. I suspect this is due to the Great Depression, which drags the median and 25% percentile down quite a bit, although the average looks pretty impressive.

I am still pretty new to stocks, so let me know if I made any egregious errors.

Anyone know of any commodity ETFs (without gas, oil, or energy) or any stocks that did well around 2009-2010 because of the El Niño that hit back then? Any notable patterns with this sort of thing?

Is there a way I can keep the physical certificates and transfer the ownership from the UTMA to myself?

Disney shareholder services says I have to send in the physical certificates to execute the change in ownership.

Would a local broker be able to do this? If I take the physical certificates to my neighborhood Schwab and open an account in my name, will Schwab be able to transfer the shares from the Disney shareholder services UTMA?

15-05-14,35z4qq,Why is there an unstable correlation between bond prices and stock prices?,"When an economy is robust, companies start to earn MORE and therefore their stock prices INCREASE. This encourages investors to FREE up capital, hence the SELLING of their bonds. The opposite is true when an economy is contracting.

By this logic, it can be deduced that when investors are looking for growth and capital appreciation, you go to stocks. When you want safety and yields you go to bonds. 

HOWEVER, it is not a stable correlation. In the 2000's until now, there is a POSITIVE correlation between the two.

Rate hike expectations have shifted considerably with relatively dovish commentary from FED policymakers and weaker than expected economic releases from US.

* **As of now market is predicting first rate hike of 25 basis points in January 2016, followed by second rate hike in June 2016. Chart courtesy SoberLook.com.**

As of now, Federal Reserve policymakers have indicated that any move would be data driven and now with market predicting no hike this year it is a challenge for policymakers whether to act ahead of market expectation. Most of the officials so far seems to have agreed on at least one rate hike this year and March's Fed funds rate projection by participants indicate still 50 basis points hike.

**June meeting turns crucial -**

* With data faltering to downside, FED will have to clearly communicate what it might be doing this year, any hawkish indication could result in severe market swings given no hike expectation this year.

* Moreover FED will publish participant's projection for growth, inflation and fed funds rate, which will be closely watched. If projection still maintains upbeat forecast with 50 basis points hike signal would be very hawkish and dollar and short term treasury yield will more likely shoot up. However as of now that doesn't look to be very probable.

Federal Reserve will hold press conference post policy announcement on June 17th after two day meeting.

15-05-15,361iup,Opinion on $SYMX,"I've been dabbling in a smaller cap company called Synthesis Energy Systems over the last few months, I wont say exactly what I have in it but I will say I got in based on what I perceived to be a good company outlook around $1.10 per share and I have been very happy seeing it even scrape $2 at times recently, especially after Paulson put a big stake into the company.

Things seem to be going well regarding their international endeavors especially in India and China and their recent conference call was inspiring, earnings arent quite what I'd like to see them at but they are improving quarter by quarter as their technology becomes more self sufficient and begins paying for itself.

From what I imagine, they seem to be one of the first companies supplying a need in regards to emissions and pollution in these and other developing countries so the long term outlook seems to be incredibly bright.

I'm still in the green overall but I will admit that the harsh recent losses on the stock market with it are still somewhat concerning, I figure it is a lot of shorts selling out of it in mass bringing the price down but it is still concerning to see such monumental drops. I still have faith that things will go very well in the future, but I myself am not the biggest stock market expert even if I do know some financials as well as even some short term speculating success on stocks that I have wished to do so towards, but still I was interested in what others might think about this one, especially in the short term, as the market has not yet committed to any particular trend for SYMX as of yet.",4

15-05-15,363yg0,Swing Trading - ever been burned?,"Hey all!

I've been doing some research on swing trading and it sounds pretty cool.  From what I've read, it looks like it's a great strategy to use for markets that are kind of stagnate. 

If you don't already know, you basically throw your money on a stock on small down turns (-1%), and sell when it's up 1%+, so it works great with volatile stocks.  

I'm thinking of how to apply it and it makes sense to me that doing this strategy with Large Cap companies would be best, so if you do throw your money in and then it drops 5% then you just switch to holding long and ride it out...good example would be Apple.  

If you look at the last 3 months for Apple, it's only increased .74%, but if you had been using Swing Trading you may have pumped out 5% in that time period.

I do understand the tax consequences of short-term capital gains, and the fact that you need to deploy 10-20k+ if you want to see any type of returns...(1% swings being 100$-200$).

If 10-20k is only a small portion of your portfolio though, and you only choose to invest with large caps that you are comfortable with holding long term, what are the down sides?",10

15-05-15,36299q,"Moving to Switzerland, looking for a good trading setup","Hi,

I feel like I need to dump my thoughts here and ask some semi-open questions.

So I'm a Swedish citizen moving to Switzerland. I'm used to awesome web interfaces, even better trading terminals for Windows, and commissions around 0.1 USD per trade.
The world outside Sweden seems to be very different.

I've spent some time looking at different providers, basically the two that remains are: Saxo Bank and Interactive Brokers

Let's start with Saxo Bank:

Pros:

- Really nice new interface, even the older one is pretty sweet but the new one seems to be really wonderful (SaxoTraderGO)

- Next-to-no custody fee (0.01%)

- Responsive support so far

Cons:

- Expensive: min 15 USD for orders @ NYSE

- They don't care about my legal status and will withhold the full dividend tax on US dividends (30%)

Now for IB:

Pros:

- Cheap!

- Open API (I guess? It seems open)

Cons:

- Someone said it's expensive for larger buy/sells (I need to check this)

- *Awful* interface. Somewhat better with NinjaTrader, but lack of web interface is really a bad thing

- US account. I need to wire my paycheck and the US government can F me over.

I found Form 1042. Can I use that to get dividends tax back in my case?

Any thoughts you have, what you would have chosen or how your setup is if you're trading US stocks from outside the US as a non-US citizen - are appreciated

**UPDATE:**

Dividend tax: Long story: Just forget about it. You can reclaim it, but it's really troublesome, and chosing broker over it will make your head hurt. If it's important go with IB, otherwise just don't focus on US Dividend stocks.

I decided to go with Saxo Bank since Exante's platform isn't as mature yet. I'll be using Exante a bit as well and keep an eye on the platform, but it's not really there yet for me.

15-05-15,362ib3,Euro and Cable rallies face key resistance levels as momentum slows down,"Currency markets continued trading under the same themes as the past few days and the price action was anything else that exciting. The Dollar was again in the backseat as the Euro and the Pound gained against it, however we could see a change in momentum or at least a slowdown as the week ends.

Both the Euro and the Cable have posted significant gains against the US Dollar recently on the back of disappointing reports coming out of the American domestic economy. Traders are looking at a string of weaker than expected performance from the US and have begun to doubt whether the Fed will pull the trigger and raise rates in September, hence the decline of the US currency.

However time might have come for these rallies to slow down a bit, even if it is only temporary, as both European currency pairs are in close proximity of key resistance levels. The Euro traded to 1.1450 yesterday and we know how important the 1.1500 area is as the Single currency slowed down its ascend. With the Euro battling to remain above the 1.1400 level this morning we believe that a retracement lower or at least a consolidation seems more likely during this last trading session of the week.

Similar is our analysis for the Cable that hit 1.5800 during the past 24 hours with the UK currency having run a more than impressive rally against the Dollar. The surprisingly easy win for the Tories in the General Election has allowed the Pound to move higher as investors looked to back the currency ahead of more years under the same government.

However, from a technical standpoint the 1.5800 level is a critical resistance area and we are not surprised to see that the Cable rejected it after its first approach. We think it will be tough for the currency to overcome this barrier at this time, there’s little in terms of expected news, developments or reports to spur further gains. Our analysis points towards a step back from the Cable and it will be interesting to see whether the currency will remain above the 1.5700 area.",0

I didn't quote believe that advice, so I decided to test it myself! My goal was to understand what leveraged index ETFs were likely to return in comparison to their non-leveraged counterparts using the entire history of the stock market, specifically for the S&amp;P 500.

First, I scooped the S&amp;P daily changes off of [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/data/YAHOO/INDEX_GSPC-S-P-500-Index). Then, I whipped up some code in MATLAB that calculated the return for every possible holding period (bought and held from day A to day B). Then I calculated the mean, median, and 25%/75% percentiles for the return for holding periods of X years. Here is a plot of the return for a hypothetical index ETF and its 2x leveraged counterpart for various holding periods.

[Graph of S&amp;P](http://i.imgur.com/oXil2lH.png)

As you can see, the lowest 25th percentile of the index and leveraged ETFs roughly coincide at early years, and then the leveraged ETF takes off at longer periods. Also in these shorter periods, the median leveraged ETF roughly coincides with the 75th percentile of the index ETF.

My assumptions were based around two current S&amp;P 500 ETFs: SPY and SSO. As such, my non-leveraged ETF has an expense ratio of 0.1% and a dividend yield of 2.0%, compounded daily. The leveraged ETF had an expense ratio of 0.9% and a dividend yield of 0.75%.

In short, if the stock market follows the patterns of the last 60 years, 2x ETFs are actually pretty good bets for long-term holding. 

However, if we look at the data for the DJIA, which runs from 1896 - 2015, the results are a [little more gloomy](http://i.imgur.com/apXzMSn.png). I suspect this is due to the Great Depression, which drags the median and 25% percentile down quite a bit, although the average looks pretty impressive.

It has really strong fundamentals, and the restaurant industry, along with the whole consumer cyclical sector, is picking up steam as people can afford to spend more on discretionary things.

The wildcard though is that it's releasing earnings Tuesday before the open.  The consensus EPS estimate was revised up to 0.88 cents per share a month ago, and it's been 0.88 cents since then.  But the price is now at a 12% discount to where it was even BEFORE the upgrade happened, with no change whatsoever in the news or outlook for Red Robin.

It missed earnings by 5% last quarter, and it seems like the market is pricing in another miss.

Edit: To be clear, I'm not holding this for years - here's a note about their long-term debt from the 6K



&gt; Long-term debt

&gt; As of March 31, 2015, based on our internal calculations we believe we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements relating to our offshore drilling fleet, but were in breach of certain financial covenants contained in our loan agreements relating to our drybulk and tanker fleets, referred to collectively as our shipping segment. Furthermore, the Company is in discussions to extend the maturity of a certain loan agreement which has lapsed. These incidents constitute events of default and may result in the lenders requiring immediate repayment of the loans. As a result of the aforementioned non-compliance and the cross-acceleration and cross-default provisions contained in our bank facilities relating to our shipping segment, we have classified the indebtedness under our bank facilities relating to our shipping segment, amounting to $1,113.1 million in the aggregate as of March 31, 2015, as current liabilities. For more information, see ""Item 5.B. Liquidity and Capital Resources – Breach of Covenants under Secured Credit Facilities"" in our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2014, filed with the Commission on March 10, 2015.

&gt; We are currently in negotiations with some of our lenders to obtain waivers of our covenant breaches, to extend our existing waivers of covenant breaches, or to extend debt maturities which have lapsed. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain our lenders' waiver or consent, or extensions, with respect to the aforementioned noncompliance under our credit facilities relating to our shipping segment, or any non-compliance with specified financial ratios or financial covenants under future financial obligations we may enter into, or that we will be able to refinance or restructure any such indebtedness. If we fail to remedy the matters discussed above, our lenders may accelerate our indebtedness under the relevant credit facilities, which could trigger the cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions contained in our other credit facilities relating to our shipping segment. If our indebtedness is accelerated, it will be very difficult in the current financing environment for us to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing and we could lose our vessels if our lenders foreclose their liens.

&gt; Management expects that the lenders will not demand immediate payment of the loans relating to our shipping segment under which we were in breach as of March 31, 2015. Management plans to settle the loan interest and scheduled loan repayments with cash expected to be generated from operations and from financing activities. In addition, if conditions in the drybulk charter, tanker and offshore drilling markets decline from current levels and the market value of our vessels decline even further, we may seek to restructure our outstanding indebtedness.

How to rent your place
First, you have to be ok with the whole concept. I am an avid Couchsurfer and have had dozens of strangers from the internet come stay at my place for the past 10 years, I have also stayed with more people than I can count, and for me a house is made to have people over. I enjoy my private time when people leave, but I also like to host.

If you have many valuables one could break, if you are a cleaning freak, or if you don’t want a stranger around your kids, renting your room or house may not be an option for you.

Even if there are solutions. You can lock your valuables, convert your place into a duplex with separate access for guests to your attic or basement, or do some home exchanges or holiday rentals while you are on holidays yourself.

 

Back to putting your place up for rent. At the moment, we have had a dozen reservations, and over 12 people have stayed with us so far.

 

 

 

 rent guest house tikal

 

 

I rent mainly with Airbnb, and it has been quite easy to manage. I recommend it if you just want to rent a bedroom, or your house while you go on holiday. As we are trying to position as a guest house, I recently registered on Booking as well, and got my first reservation soon after, although Booking doesn’t charge guests so you have to charge them, and since we can’t charge a credit card, the person got scared and cancelled when I asked her to wire the money.

On Airbnb, they charge the guest, keep the money until check-in, then pay you. Both parties are safe.

Airbnb charges the guest 10% admin fee, and 3% to the host, while Booking charges the host 15%.

 

Both sites will work better if you put tons of pictures and descriptions. Be concise, but talk about everything. Is there wifi, a washing machine, a shared kitchen, can people use the fridge, is the bathroom a shower or a tub? etc. And how to get there, if there is public transportation, as many won’t rent a car.

Most people will ask those questions anyway, so putting them in an ad is one way to avoid repeating yourself in an email over and over again.

 

Both sites will require you keep an updated calendar of availability and rates. Make sure you do it and put a note to update it regularly. It will not only help you rank better on their search engine, but also save you time canceling over bookings. Check out the dates of Spring Break, Christmas holidays and other long weekends if you want to raise your rates, or prevent bookings and have your friends over.

 

 

Pros about renting your place
 

Money! Next month, we are going to Miami, and someone booked our house for a full month for $800. That will cover our two flights plus the cost of our staff while we are away. How is that for awesome? Finding a tenant for a whole month in the middle of the Guatemalan jungle that would come exactly while we travel to the US was pretty much a miracle, but you live in a big city, you can rent your place easily when you go away.

 

Offer additional services. I offer to cook diner for them, and barely break even because I am alone tending to 2-4 people, but it is more a public service as there aren’t restaurants nearby. You can offer more expensive meals and make a profit. Big margins are on coffee and drinks. I also offer them to rent my car, hire a driver (which is also a public service, I don’t earn a cent on it, my mechanic does the job and it’s nice to see a nice person who otherwise wouldn’t connect with tourists get part of the tourism money), rent kayaks from my neighbors, take a cooking class in the village, go explore the jungle with my handyman…

Now that I listed them all, I make money on none, but benefit other people so it is still a win for the village. You on the other hand could make extra money offering a cheap room and then charging for those extras. Renting a place for a week to a business person in a big city can get you some dry cleaning, cooking and maybe driving to the airport extras for example.

 

You already have a place. This is easy to set up and requires almost no investment, just clean sheets and towels to start with. As you go, if you enjoy the idea you can buy nicer things and raise your rates. I have even seen people in big cities get bigger apartments and have rentals cover the difference, instead of a full time roommate. You are making money with something you already have, which is pretty awesome.

 

Flexible home exchange. I like the idea of home swaps for the holidays, when you are in NY and want to go to Florida, and find a family who wants to do the opposite, then you swap properties. However, you need to have similar dates, comparable housing options (downtown Manhattan for Miami Beach, suburbs for suburbs, or a bigger house for a better located small one)… And it can get complicated. Renting your place and keeping the money so you can go on holiday is like having a flexible home swap. Once someone has booked your place, and you have the cash, it is much easier to find a holiday option for yourself rather than trying to locate the perfect swap.

 

 

 

Cons about renting your place
 

Lack of privacy. We do not share a bathroom with guests, but have had to when renting in NYC or SF on Airbnb. Still, guests can decide they want to lounge all day and do nothing, and you’ll have them around. No romantic diner, quiet sunset or private life while there are strangers in your air.

 

They take a LOT of time. People are needy, they are in foreign territory, they want to talk, tell you about their day like they are Christopher Columbus, even though you’ve been to the Maya ruins 10 times and heard that very same story 100 times. You’ll be up before they want breakfast, and down after they go to bed, to clean up and wash their dishes.

 

People think you are a travel agency. I am happy to give tips about the region, but when it gets into the minutiae of how they should plan their day, or when they want to exchange 12 emails about their plans in a city 300 miles away, the hourly rate suddenly gets close to minimum wage.

 

Some will expect a full hotel. One couple wanted 4 pillows, towels changed every day… while booking on Airbnb a place described as rustic and in the middle of the jungle. For the luxury jungle lodge you can go pay $300 and up at nearby hotels. You have to set your conditions and be clear. I don’t mind extra towels and pillows, but a) not at 9pm when I want to go to bed and b) I don’t have a washing machine so that means extra hours for the cleaner, and less profit.

 

Being friendly can lead to abuse. When you tell people they can use your drinking fountain, you don’t expect them to fill their half gallon bottle for their day trip (saving $0.5)? They will. They will even take the tank off to get the last drop. Give them coffee mugs and they will go through your personal shelf to grab your personal mug because they like it better. You have to put limits to everything. Where is your space, where is theirs, noise, what can they drink/eat, etc.

 

Plans will change. That same couple (they were a real PITA) cancelled diner on me at 6pm, when all the food was cooked and ready. I tried my hardest to smile and say “no worries” but wanted to strangle them. The following morning, they had asked me to book them a driver and told me at 7am they didn’t want their 9am pick up. The previous day they had hired a driver until 2pm and had him drive 60 more miles than agreed, drop them three hours late at 5pm and just shrugged saying “yeah, you know, we just made a very small detour”, then complained when I asked them for an extra… hold your breath… $12. Those people will eat up your profits.

After learning the hard way, the option is to raise your rates and be at peace with it. People can also cancel 5 days in advance for a full refund on Airbnb so you should consider it side income, don’t count on it to pay your mortgage or your holidays.

 

Some guests are a pain. Like the ones above, we also had a family who forgot an iPad. We weren’t home so the maid found it. I told the guests I would put it in courier for $100. I was ready to go to the post office on my gas and time, but not to bring it with me to Miami so they could get a cheaper rate, as my luggage space is limited and I am not that kind anyway. So they went behind my back, called the maid, who is from Spain, and convinced her to take the iPad to Spain, ship it to a Spanish friend of theirs, so the friend could give it to them (they live in CALIFORNIA!) and they could save on shipping, while not enjoying their iPad for over 2 months.

When people prefer bothering several persons to take care of their personal mess instead of being responsible adults, you can imagine how they will behave in your property. Yes, they did leave with toilet paper too.

 

 

 

 

 

Ok, looks like I needed to vent about the past couple of guests. But… the money has been good and covered our housing expenses and staff for the past three months. Actually, it is my goal this year to make $500 a month with the guest house, for a $5,000 yearly profit ($1,000 would go on cleaning fees and utilities) and cover the cost of the house.

It isn’t much, I just need to rent 7 nights a month to have a free place to myself the rest of the time.

Since November and our first guests, I have made over $1,500 in profit. What I like best is the flexibility you can have to rent just one weekend per year if you’d like, and no more, without much trouble. That is still a grey area legally though, as you are not a hotel, so you need to check if you can operate that kind of business where you live, and how to report your earnings.

The only thing I care about is preservation of wealth + paying some amount of interest for him to live off of. He is a very frugal person and I know, regardless of the advice about indexes here, he only cares about a low risk way to maintain his lifestyle.

Recently he went to a financial planner and they had given him a proposal that involved lots of MLPs/Preferreds/municipal closed end funds for tax purposes - funds that had almost a 2% expense ratio and used leverage to make up for the increased risk that needed to be assumed due to the extra expenses. I told him I thought that this was a bad idea and that personally if he was living off of &lt;$200k a year he should just put everything into a diversified portfolio of bonds that he can hold to maturity even in a rising rate environment.

Now my question is, how do I actually go about making this happen? Is there a planner that will create a diversified portfolio of bonds  for me or are they all going to recommend sticking it in bond funds, which I would prefer not to do. Or if anyone has any advice as far as books on the topic go I would be eager to read them.

15-05-16,3666mt,Best brokerage for fees/platform?,"I have been with Scottrade for the past 7 years, and got into options trading around a year ago. I recently realized the volume of trades I am doing has severely increased the commissions I am having to pay out.

In calling Scottrade to take money out and put in another brokerage, they lowered my options fees to $7+0.75, but I think I can do way better than this.

I signed up for IB, but didn't realize until after I funded my account that they charge so many additional fees (https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/accounts/fees/NASDAQBXoptfee.php as an example) that Scottrade seems to be cheaper (especially since I am not going to do market orders on options!). In one case, IB was going to be $1.69/contract after all fees!

I have seen terrible reviews for eOption, and am concerned now that there are hidden fees that I won't see until after my first purchase at a new brokerage.

I am tempted to go back to Scottrade and attempt to negotiate an even lower rate, but am hoping someone may have a great brokerage they use. Account minimums are no concern for me.

TL;DR - Fees suck. Where, with your personal experience, is cheap but not a POS?

15-05-16,3666to,Do you think Red Robin (RRGB) offer a really good opportunity on Monday?,"It's releasing earnings Tuesday before the open.  The consensus EPS estimate was revised up to 0.88 cents per share a month ago, and it's been 0.88 cents since then.  But the price is now at a 12% discount to where it was, with no change whatsoever in the news or outlook for Red Robin.

It missed earnings by 5% last quarter, and it seems like the market is pricing in another miss. To me this seems like a situation where all a company has to do is meet expectations for the stock price to spike, possibly as high as 12%.  If it beats, it could be even more. And if it misses, the market has already largely priced that in.  So the magnitude of the gap down for a miss wouldn't be nearly as big as the gap up for a beat would be.

Red Robin has really strong fundamentals, and the restaurant industry, along with the whole consumer cyclical sector, is picking up steam as people can afford to spend more on discretionary things.  So I'm thinking of buying shares on Monday.  If it gaps down after earnings, I'll buy more shares.  If it gaps up, then yay fast money.

What do you think?

15-05-16,367hjc,Unusual Annualized ROI Calculation Problem?,"**Example:**

* However, the money cannot compound because the maximum quarterly investment is 6250. So, if I invest 6250 in Q1, then take the proceeds and use the return to offset part of the 6250 in Q2, then Q3, then Q4. How do I calculate an ROI?

We all wish we had bought bitcoin at 50 cents each, regardless of what you feel about Cryptocurrency.  
  
Since then, a lot of copy/paste clones have hit the market.  Litecoin, Dogecoin, etc, etc.  
  
They failed to offer anything new or compelling, and despite my love for Dogecoin, it was 100% novelty and hype that blew Doge up.  
  
**Well, there's something new now.**  
  
This is a big deal, because for the first time since bitcoin was released, we have something elegant, simple, and powerful, *that notably improves on the bitcoin protocol and had a fair launch*.   
  
Monero (people are divided on whether the name is silly or likable) is a substantial improvement over bitcoin in terms of privacy and security.  It is *so much* better, that it is arguably the first true ""bitcoin 2"" contender.  
  
But it's new, and has had a rocky birth.  There is a lot of risk, but because there is risk, there is also the potential for massive profit.  
  
Monero moved from 50 cents to about 62 cents each over the last few days.  I have gone nearly 100% Monero since learning about it, as I feel like it posesses the best speculatory profit potential in the entire world today.  
  
**I, americanpegasus, hereby promise you that Monero will hit ~at least~ $1 per Monero.**  If it does not, I will leave Reddit forever.  *So, considering they are worth about 62 cents each, I am basically guaranteeing you over 50% profit.*  
  
And between you and me, I'm not even worried about that dollar mark.  Because secretly, I think that Monero may be headed for the same stratospheric rise that we saw from Bitcoin.  I am truly imagining a slow and rocky rise from sub-$1 prices to $50, and eventually the hundreds...  (and maybe much more).  
  
##but don't take my word for it.  
  
I'm a large holder, so you shouldn't trust me.  Please do your own research and understand that this is not without risk.  
  
You can start by reading some of the technical blurbs over on /r/AmericanPegasus  but will then need to venture onto Google and bitcoin talk.  
  
http://www.reddit.com/r/AmericanPegasus/comments/35vees/im_getting_excited_about_monero_and_going_to_move/  
  
If you don't know much about crypto, you're going to have to buy bitcoin first, and exchange it for Monero.  You can buy bitcoin easily with a bank account or credit card through companies like Circle and Coinbase, and then exchange that bitcoin for Monero on crypto exchanges like Poloniex.  
  
Is it a little convoluted?  Yeah?  
  
But once it's easy, then everyone is doing it, right?  
  
If you don't believe me, fine.  Simply sit on the sidelines as Monero explodes upward in value, similar to how bitcoin did at inception.  Then you can cuss me out and call me a ""lucky fuck"" or whatever else you want.  Fact is, you're sitting on the sidelines of one of the biggest crypto plays in history and no one gives a shit what you think.  
  
Or, if you are willing to take that risk (and don't let me fool you, there is a lot of risk here) then buy some Monero and get on the rocketship with me.

15-05-16,367pex,"Crude oil alpha-carry arbitrage (Short, low expense)","I am of the opinion that crude oil is overvalued at this price point. My reasons for this will follow. But since this is WSB, let me tell you how to profit from Crude oil's downturn:

**What is the ""alpha carry"":**

We will use a strategy my derivatives professor called the ""alpha carry"".

The strategy entails being short (long) a commodity, while at the same time being long (short) a user of the commodity on the public market whom is either well hedged (swimming naked) or cutting dividends (issuing equity).


If you are from Canada, this trade will be better as I am more familiar with Canadian companies, if not, skip to the USA part:

I believe that the Canadian investor should short HUC.TO or long SCO if you have USD, while going long ARX.TO, or other low-debt, dividend paying oil &amp; gas companies.

As a USA investor, you should go long SCO, and also go long Tesoro oil corporation, or XOM.


**Why it works**

This strategy requires a company which has shown strong discipline through volatility and healthy D/E ratios. ARX.TO is a perfect candidate for this strategy as the USD should surge back with continued lowering of interest rates world wide and ARX.TO being both well hedged on their production, and benefiting from a **negative** Western Canadian Select discount on promised delivery (or a premium).

**Why oil is a short in my opinion**

There are many frack contracts which have yet to be cancelled in the USA and Canada. With the spring thaw, these fracks will start and their cancellation is only possible after at least a month of operation (the put option in the real options framework). Therefore supply will surge again this summer before crude oil begins its true rally in Q3 2015.

**Disclaim**

OP is long ARX.TO since years ago @ 21.37, OP will add to his ARX.TO position and either enter short HUC.TO or long SCO Monday.

I have read about things such as [human capital contracts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Capital_Contract). I wanted to get the thoughts of people who actually actively invest on something similar though.

I am not sure what return on investment the average person looks for when considering to invest. I was wondering what sort of annual interest rate you would all want out of something closer to a bond.  The idea is to treat these funds as student loans but to buy back bonds regularly upon graduation.

Specifics:

- Bonds would be worth 1000 dollars each.

- Originally looked at 5% interest, compounding annually.

- Bonds begin getting purchased back upon graduation with people being able to opt for ""fast repayment"" or ""higher repayment"" to put themselves in order.

The purpose of this is to eliminate the financial stress of if you can afford routine expenses, tuition in some cases, and other things that can come up (such as car repairs). 

I wasn't sure which subreddit would make the most sense, but if my goal would be to at some point seek investors for this, then asking investors makes the most sense.

Summary of questions for ease of reference:

1) What interest rate or return on investment do you aim for annually. 

2) Do you think you would be open to a model similar to what is listed? Investing in the future of another person with a guarantee of repayment and interest.

3) How would one go about finding those in their area interested in such a proposal? I assume calling an investment firm would be a no for privacy reasons, so would carpet bombing letters be the best approach? I assume such things are spam. Question is how to reach the audience.

If a bunch of mindless morons trade what you say, you buy in big, tell them to buy, price goes up, then you leave before them. You look a hero for making ""picks"" but in reality it is your followers that actually make them work, cause and effect are not what they seem here. This is why I call him a fake trader; he scalps his ""students"".

I do wonder why after so many years of seeing the same tired old scams, played the same way by the same types of sleaze, they always get new suckers. There are many like Sykes and it nearly always works the same way, the more sophisticated version tries to pump some special trading software. I don't think you are going to convince someone that is new what is legit or not, they always know better simply due to the Dunning-Kruger effect, almost anything seems ""legit"" to them if it is above their own skill level.

15-05-17,368gq7,[uk-specific] What does your IFA charge?,"/r/ukinvesting is pretty dead, so I thought I'd ask here (although in many ways its kinda UK-specific)

IFA regulation in the UK has changed quite a lot over the past year or two, and so all IFA's have scrambled to restructure their fees now that they cannot earn from product commission.

- I'm curious to know what other people are paying in terms of annual management, but specifically anyone who invests in the more speculative funds?

Mine charges 1% of my portfolio per annum, not for the money invested, but for the entire portfolio under management, but then there are fund manager fees on top, averaging about 0.3%

I'm ok with that *for the moment*, as they have been producing very good results for past 5 years+.

I know the stock response on reddit would be to ditch my IFA, and move it into ETF's or passive index trackers. Thanks but this isn't what Im looking for, and I do understand the impact fees have on a portfolio over time. 

- I'm considering approaching my IFA and ask they ratchet the percentage down as my portfolio grows. What are the chances of them agreeing to that do you think?

15-05-17,368pcj,How/where to screen/scan for stocks?,"One of the things I've had and still have the hardest time with is screaming for potential trades.  I say trades because I rarely stay in anything more than several months.  So I don't think I qualify as an investor as much as a trader.  Anyway, I need a lot of work and tweaking to my system, which you guys are already starting to help with.  However, the one thing that has frustrated me the most is finding something worth trading.  It always seems by the time I find it, I'm too damn late.  I would love to be in and out of something in days or weeks rather than months and wind up with respectable returns.  But what I have is a laundry list of stocks I watch almost daily waiting for one of them to move just the right way so I can pounce.  And then I watch it for weeks or months until it looses steam and I bail.  Or, it doesn't do what I expected it do do and I get nervous and bail anyway.  

So, would anybody like to share their methods for finding potential trades?  How often do you go looking?  How many do you look for when you're on the hunt?  Do you use screaners, scans, reports put out by TDA?  What?  I would love to get more comfortable with this part of the process.  Please help!",4
15-05-18,36beq7,60/40 considered harmful?,"The 60/40 split stocks and bonds portfolio has been the bread and butter allocation recommended to an average Joe for what seems like forever. However, when compared to a barbell strategy that overweights risky assets on one end and super safe ones at the other end or a risk parity portfolio such as the Harry Browne's Permanent Portfolio the 60/40 looks abysmal on the risk reward scale. 

https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation?s=y&amp;TotalBond2=40&amp;portfolio3=Custom&amp;portfolio2=Custom&amp;portfolio1=Custom&amp;TIPS1=10&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;TotalStockMarket3=25&amp;TotalStockMarket2=60&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;EmergingMarket1=10&amp;endYear=2014&amp;mode=2&amp;SmallCapValue1=10&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;startYear=1972&amp;Gold1=10&amp;Gold3=25&amp;IntlSmall1=10&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;TwoYearTBills3=25&amp;TwoYearTBills1=50&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;LongTermBond3=25

Consider the above back test of three different allocations here. The first is similar to Larry Swedroe's fat tail minimization strategy, the second is the classic 60/40 and the third is the Permanent Portfolio. They all have virtually the same long term CAGR but 60/40 does it with much more volatility and proportionally worse Sharpe/Sortino. 

What the hell do the financial advisers do pushing 60/40 at people when it is clearly an inferior portfolio to most modern asset allocation schemes?",2

15-05-17,368w9g,Creating the Bond Bubble - Role of the Stock Market,"All over the place they are touting that the stock market will crash and burn. Indeed, when you say there is a coming crash, everyone immediately assumes that means the stock market. It appears that the bulk of those who claim to be analysts are all proclaiming the coming stock market crash. This is typical since no one in the field has really be around for a collapse in government. In the United States, we had the Sovereign Debt collapse during the 1840s of many states who defaulted permanently on their bonds trying to bail out the banks after Andrew Jackson’s closure of the Second Bank of the United States. [Here](http://i0.wp.com/armstrongeconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/913-ECM-1830-1839.jpg) is Wave #913 of the ECM. What is relative here is that the famous Panic of 1837 came on the half-cycle after the peak where the share market actually topped out in the USA during 1835. That wave bottomed in 1839 and thereafter began the State Sovereign Debt Defaults since Jackson had destroyed the central bank and the USA entered the age of Wildcat Banking where state banks issued money.

 The [share market](http://i1.wp.com/armstrongeconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DJ1840s-SovDefaults.jpg?zoom=1.5&amp;resize=584%2C438) in the USA peaked in 1835 with the ECM and it declined for about 7 years into 1842. The Panic of 1837 unfolded as Jackson effectively adopted austerity demanding everything be paid in gold. That set off a massive deflationary wave and the closing of the Second Bank of the United States in 1836 set off a real nightmare. Jackson closed the bank because it had been funding political candidates who were his rivals. In this respect, Goldman Sachs has learned to pay both sides and bet on no one but themselves.

The above ECM chart of Wave #913 illustrates that the US share market bottomed in the chaos in 1842 as the massive deflationary wave set in thanks to Jackson’s austerity move. Yet once states began to permanently default in 1842, capital ran into private assets. We see the US share market bottomed with the deflation in 1842 and then rallied for 10 years.

 The State and Federal defaults in the USA go back further to the collapse of the Continental Congress and the reorganization of the United States where the constitution forbid the states from ever issuing money on their own once again. The transition to US dollars was not without its pain. There were wild gyrations and Hamilton directed the bank of New York to buy his paper to try to do the exact same type of stimulation the ECB and the Fed have engaged in today. The Panic of 1791 was also a banking crisis.

So How did the financial markets respond to such events domestically within the United States? The  Panic of 1791 was followed by a massive real estate bubble which then burst during the next Panic of 1792.

At this time, we see that there is the traditional risk of a correction in the share market that could set off the final stage of the bond bubble. Keep in mind this is not going to materialize in the long-end of bonds/bunds. What we are seeing is capital is not rushing into the 10 year or greater paper, it is rushing into the very short end. Rates there are negative as there is not enough short-term paper around to meet the demands to park cash.

We [still see](http://i2.wp.com/armstrongeconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DJFOR-W-5-13-2015.jpg?zoom=1.5&amp;resize=584%2C438) May – July – September as key targets for turning points. Whatever we end up with in September should produce the opposite trend immediately thereafter. As we now head into the last week of May/first week of June, we should start to see the choppy trends begin.

It is more likely than not that we should see a retest of support that will scare people and cause them to believe the stock market will crash. The high in the Dow still remains March 2nd at 18,335 level. Support begins at the 17,153 level and a daily closing beneath that level will signal the correction is then possible. The key support lies back at 16,540 level. A drop back to that area in the weeks and months ahead should convince everyone to buy more government paper and complete the final bubble top in government debt.",2

15-05-18,36dq1p,Valuating Anavex Life Sciences (AVXL),"In my opinion, the value of Anavex stock depends on the upcoming results of the phase 2a  clinical drug trial of Anavex 273 which is currently underway. The preliminary results are scheduled to be released in the 3rd quarter of 2015 (July-Sept.). If that news shows it is at least marginally effective against Alzheimer's (and by extension, against Mild Cognitive Impairment), then Anavex stock will be worth a lot. If that news shows it is ineffective, it will be worth very little.

I have Mild Cognitive Impairment, which may be an early stage of Alzheimer's, and there are no effective drugs for MCI or Alzheimer's. DISCLAIMER: I own a bunch of Anavex stock, although I hope Anavex 273 works well more for my brain than for my portfolio. This is my favorite stock.

Anavex Life Sciences is still in an initial research stage, meaning it has no products yet, and no revenue. That means a lot of traditional means of valuating a company won't work. For example, you can't apply a ""times-earnings"" formula, because they have no earnings. There are many ways to estimate a company's value, however, and here is what I came up for Anavex with a few years ago. This is based on Avavex 273 being effective, because if it is ineffective, it will be worth near zero.

Estimate the number of patients who could benefit from Anavex 273 before its patents expire, estimate the lifetime retail value per patient, and multiply those to get an estimate of the total retail value of Anavex 273. Estimate a profit percentage to remove the costs of manufacturing, distribution, marketing, etc. and multiply it by the total retail value to estimate the company value. This value is based on  Anavex 273 (and the Anavex 273 Plus variant) only, and does not include the other sigma receptor drug candidates the company has in development because they are not as far along in the development process. You can estimate the value per share simply by dividing the estimated company value by the number of shares, but the share should include exercisable options, warrants, and convertible debt, not just the current float or outstanding shares.

Here are some estimates I came up with a long time ago:

Number of U.S. Patients, Alzheimers only: 14,000,000 

Lifetime Value Per Patient, retail, A-273 only: $10,000 

Retail Value: $140,000,000,000 

Profit Percentage: 20% 

Company Value, A-273 for Alzheimers only: $28,000,000,000 
  
Outstanding Shares (if all are exercised): 116,400,000 

Value Per Outstanding Share, A-273-Alz only: $241 

Substitute your own estimates and see your own what-if analysis. My notes say my estimates are for U.S. Alzheimer's patients only because that was the only reliable numbers I could find. There are many millions more worldwide with Alzheimer's and others with Mild Cognitive Impairment, but those numbers are much harder to track down or estimate. My lifetime value per patient estimate is based on an initial therapy  period followed by a permanent maintenance dose. I have a vague recollection that someone told me my profit percentage estimate may be quite low -- but I am not a stock analyst and I am not an expert in the pharmaceutical industry. My total for outstanding shares was calculated a long time ago, and in the most recent meeting-in-lieu-of-an-annual-shareholders-meeting, shareholders authorized Anavex to issue more shares, and I have not reexamined their SEC filings to update an accurate count.

As of this writing, Avavex is still trading below half a dollar per share. Its price between now and the phase 2a trial results are anyone's guess, because the stock market is an auction, after all, so it is subject to issues of awareness, emotions, and estimates on the likelihood of success in the phase 2a trail. If the trial is successful, there should be lots of articles about it, which can dramatically increase awareness of the stock and increase positive emotions about it, leading fewer people to sell and more people to buy, which is the standard recipe for dramatic increases in stock prices. Based on my estimates above, there is a lot up upward potential.

If my estimate of potential company value seems unrealistic when compared to profitable, long-established pharmaceutical companies, perhaps I have made gross errors in my estimates. An alternative is that the potential for Avavex is just that good because of the huge number of potential patients, the death-sentence severity of the disease, and the current lack of any drug competitors.

I am very optimistic about the prospects for Anavex 273 being successful, but my notes on my study of that issue are incomplete. My expectations are irrelevant, however, because the results to be announced next quarter will supersede any analysis I performed in the past. Anavex Life Sciences is traded on OTC-QX, which is the relatively new high-requirement over-the-counter board. Anavex management and reporting is NASDAQ-ready, in my opinion, once they have a product on the market and have revenue that meets the threshold for NASDAQ. The last few months, liquidity of Anavex on OTC has not been an issue because it has become one of the more popular stocks on OTC. My biggest surprise is that with the recent increase in popularity, that so many people are still willing to sell shares. I guess if you bought at twenty cents and sell at forty, you're satisfied to have doubled your money, right? If the phase 2a results are bad, then I guess they made a good choice, but otherwise I don't think their satisfaction will last if the stock price goes into tens or hundreds of dollars per share.

15-05-19,36gngk,Why you can be a bad trader and still make money,"Traders believe that they just have to find the one trading strategy that will finally make them all the money they desire. However, after years of trading and frustration, most traders will recognize that the hunt for the Holy Grail is not going to yield the reward they have been looking for. That’s when they start looking for answers elsewhere. In the following article, we explore one of the most underrated and misunderstood concepts in trading. If you understand how to use the reward to risk ratio correctly, you will know why even a trader who loses most of his trades, can easily come out ahead.

What is the Reward to Risk Ratio?

First things first, in its core the risk reward ratio is the ratio between the distances of your entry and your take profit and stop loss order. This is how to calculate the risk reward ratio:

Reward = Take Profit Price  – Entry Price
Risk = Entry Price – Stop Loss Price

Reward to Risk Ratio = Reward / Risk

Let’s assume you buy a stock at $110 with a stop loss at $105 and your take profit at $120. Applying the formula above, you get a reward to risk ratio of 2.
Reward = $120 -  $110 = $10

Risk = $110 – $105 = $5

Reward to Risk Ratio = $10 / $5 = 2

 Why you can be a bad trader and still make money

You are right, this is nothing to get excited about, but what will come next will be an eye-opener. The things that the reward to risk ratio tells you will be very helpful and enable you to make trading decisions on a whole new level.

What the reward to risk ratio tells you

Here comes why the reward risk ratio should be among your mot favorite trading concepts. The reward to risk ratio tells you immediately whether or not you should take a trade and you can make money over the long term.

A reward to risk ratio of 2, as seen above, means that your winning trades will be twice as big as your losing trades. Therefore, for every three trades you only need one winning trade in order to at least break-even; which translates into a required winrate of 33%.

A trader who knows his personal winrate, which every broker will have ready for you, can combine it with the concept of risk reward ratio to avoid trades with a negative expectancy:

1. Skip trades where your reward to risk ratio is not large enough for your winrate

2. Don’t try to manipulate the reward to risk ratio of a trade in order to match your winrate.

3. To take this concept to the next level, track the winrate statistics for individual setups and instruments.

The graphic below illustrates how the reward to risk ratio and the winrate interact. The higher your reward to risk ratio, the lower you winrate can be.

 What the reward to risk ratio tells you

Trading myth: Trading with a 50% winrate is gambling

How often have you heard someone telling you that trading with a 50% winrate is gambling or that you should avoid trades with a reward to risk ratio of less than2? Yes, we all know these people and they could not be further from the truth.

To be a professional and profitable trader, you don’t need a high winrate. You don’t even need a winrate of 50%. Not even close. You can lose the vast majority of your trades and still make money. It all comes down to the right combination of reward to risk ratio and winrate.

I can already hear the other tribe of traders protesting about what we have just written, but, in contrast  to other trading concepts, the use and the application of the reward to risk ratio is not subjective or debatable; it’s a verified, mathematical concept that is already influencing your trading performance, whether you agree with it or not.

 

Conclusion: Trading is more than entries and indicators

Research proved that far more than 95% of all traders lose money consistently. The vast majority of all traders is following the same path, looking for better and fancier indicators, trying system after system and wondering why they, even after years, still lose money consistently. We strongly encourage you to take a look outside the box and follow the suggestions of professional traders who know that trading successfully is not about finding better entries, but about creating an edge by using proven concepts.",1

15-05-18,36c6vh,Effects of Various Economic Conditions on the Markets,"When I asked Pauline about writing a second guest post here, she suggested I talk about factors that will affect the average investor’s retirement nest egg. So in this post, I’ll be discussing the various economic and historical conditions that will affect investors in the medium tern (1-5 years) and long term future (5 to 10 years out), and how you can prepare yourself when each of these conditions hit.

Inflation
Without going into the arcane and pointless details, I’ll explain QE (quantitative easing) in good ole’ plain English. QE is the Federal Reserve’s way of printing money, thereby injecting more and more liquidity (money) into the financial system. Bernake (Fed Chairman) believes that this will pull the American economy out of the muck for good, and right now, whether this is working or not is still questionable.

HOWEVER, quantitative easing does have a problem – the printing of money theoretically speaking should cause inflation. But since QE first began, inflation has been virtually non-existent. How come?

According to theory, printing money causes inflation. BUT, what the economy has been experiencing post-recession is a deflationary environment. The economy isn’t doing too well, and prices should be declining. But with the Fed’s printing of money, the deflation is negated, resulting in zero inflation.

However, sooner or later (probably sooner, along the lines of 1 – 2 years) inflation is going to (finally) pick up. Why? Think of it this way. Deflation has always existed, and the Fed’s printing of money has been negating this deflation. However, soon that negation will be over (when the inflation is sufficient enough to totally negate the deflation), and the printing of money will finally cause real inflation.

So what do you do when inflation hits? Historically speaking, investors think that inflation is bad for stocks. That’s a huge misconception. This misconception only exists because stocks went flat in the 1970s when inflation was huge. HOWEVER, the 1970s were an anomaly – we experienced stagflation, when inflation was coupled with a sagging economy. In most cases, inflation occurs in a growing economy (or in today’s case, a nominally growing GDP). I believe that this time around, the recovery is real and that we’re not going to experience stagflation.

Hence, I think that buying stocks would be great when inflation hits. When inflation comes around, currencies get devalued and nominally speaking stock prices rise, leading to greater returns for equity investors.

Devaluation
Devaluation is closely linked to inflation – when governments print money, the real value of their currencies becomes devalued. Whenever currencies get devalued, all hard assets such as stocks and commodities shoot up in price. Speaking of commodities…

The Once in a Lifetime Opportunity
People believe that precious metals are a hedge against an economic downturn. Again, that’s a misconception. When the 2008 recession hit, precious metals (gold and silver) actually fell the hardest. This misconception originates (again) from the 1970s when a crappy economy was coupled with soaring gold and silver prices.

Precious metals rose in the 1970s not because of the poor economy but because of inflation. The 1970s were a rare case of stagflation, something that doesn’t fit in with today. Currently, the economy is humming along, but inflation will be a big issue. Thus, when inflation starts to creep up it will be a once in a lifetime opportunity for medium term investors who are willing to hold onto their gold and silver positions for at least a year.

The Fight for Resources
There’s a prime fundamental reason (besides inflation) that supports the rise in commodity prices (especially gold and silver). It’s simple. We have fewer and fewer resources to feed a larger and larger population. When Thomas Malthus first predicted that the world would end (this was back in 1798), he forgot to factor in technology. Technological improvements can increase the efficiency at which we extract our resources. HOWEVER, even technology has a limit. The efficiency is ultimately limited to the amount of resources we have. Currently, the world is reaching a turning point. If all the emerging market nations start to consume at the rate Americans do, the world’s resources would be gone sooner rather than later. When the demand for raw materials goes up and the supply goes down, prices will soar.

Historical Charts
You’ve all heard it – historically, the U.S. stock market has yielded (on average) 7.5% returns. That’s actually a really clever lie concocted by brokers and financial groups to get you to purchase equities.

The “average of 7.5%” is from the post-War period. If you look at a different time frame, such as if you were to include the Great Depression, the “average rate of return” is a lot less. That’s what the financial industry does – repackaging facts to make them look better than when they first came in.

The post-war period is actually an anomaly, a period of unprecedented economic growth that is unlikely to be repeated again in the near future. This growth was caused by major technological revolutions, from household appliances to computers to the internet and high speed communications. Today? Come on guys – the market is going to grow at 7.5% with a bunch of undergrads making $0.99 iPhone apps.

My point is, if the stock market is going to pick up its pace in the long run, it needs to be supported by major technological leaps. Unfortunately, since the dawn of the internet our society’s brightest have been attracted towards the fast money of internet riches, drawn away from solid industries that actually contribute to mankind’s life (think of space mining, green energy – the capital intensive industries). Thus, without any major technological revolutions happening right now how can we expect economic and market growth to pick up? We can’t. There’s no driver for the growth engine.

The Summary
To sum it all up, I’m going to divide things into two time frames. The medium time frame is the 1-5 year outlook, whereas the long term outlook is 5-20 years.

For the medium outlook, things are looking decidedly positive. Once inflation picks up (which is inevitable with all the money printing), stocks and commodities are going to soar, particularly gold and silver whose bull markets aren’t over.

However, the long term is less positive. Sure, the stock market will still experience long term bull markets. But I don’t think the average rate of return will be 7.5% anymore, unless we experience another major technological breakthrough. The problem is that these breakthroughs are the results of years and years of work, something that hasn’t happened thanks to all our smartest engineers being attracted to industries that do not really contribute that much to mankind. (I like Facebook as much as the next guy in line, but hey, it hasn’t had as much an impact on my life as the advent of the computer has.)",1

The World at Your Fingertips

Transferring money domestically is a cinch today; with nothing more than a tap and a swipe on your smartphone, you can move funds between accounts or pay a bill. That process, however, is much harder when you're looking to help pay your mom's gas bill in Mexico City or Manila. Foreign cash remittance has traditionally relied on lengthy paperwork for costly bank wires, or time and expense spent at inefficient physical agent locations to send and receive cash payments.

The global remittance market exceeds $500 billion in transfers annually, so fixing the customer experience to make foreign transfers easy is a worthy challenge. By focusing strictly on digital transactions through its desktop and mobile applications, Xoom does just that, offering its 1.3 million mostly immigrant customers in the U.S. a convenient, nearly instantaneous transfer of funds, at huge savings compared to the traditional money-transfer methods. With a simple tap and swipe, a customer can send cash back home, with the recipient receiving money via direct deposit, cash pickup, or delivery in 33 countries, including the largest remittance markets like India, Mexico, and the Philippines.

The X-Factor

Approximately 90% of Xoom's gross sending volume is funded by bank accounts through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) system, and Xoom processes 95% of these transactions instantly to expedite disbursement by its partners. Xoom refers to this as ""instant ACH,"" and it means that the recipients get their money immediately after it's transferred.

Let's look at China as a case in point; Xoom entered the market this year. Senders pay an $8.88 fee (8 is a lucky number in Chinese culture), plus a foreign exchange spread, to deliver funds instantly to most Chinese banks. In comparison, about 75% of remittances into China take place using bank-to-bank wire transfers, which generally run $30 per transaction plus foreign exchange spreads, and take three to five days to complete, after waiting at the bank to fill out long forms.

Cracking the instant transfer nut is a tremendous challenge, because funds take a few days to clear, and losses from fraud and other transaction reversals are a significant cost to the business. As such, Xoom's most compelling attribute may be the part customers don't even see: its risk management model. Developed over the last decade, this critical business process is the reason why Xoom can fund its transfers in most cases almost immediately, delivering cash to recipients days before the sent funds settle as ""money-good"" in Xoom's own accounts. If the risk screening turns up a flag, the transaction can be slowed down to give funds time to clear. Moreover, Xoom's use of ACH allows it to piggybacks on banks' own security measures, cuts the chances of dealing with illegal activity, and gives it a path for collections if necessary. With this risk management in place, Xoom avoids most reversals, giving the company a low-cost advantage while delivering faster and smoother service. Customers use it, like it, and stick with it; Xoom's customers use the service 2.6 times per quarter on average, and nearly 80% of the business is done through a simple one-tap and one-swipe ""Quick Send"" repeat transaction process.

Annual loss rates have been 0.35% or lower as a percentage of gross sending volume since 2010, with loss rates in recent quarters under 0.2%. These industry-low loss rates make for high gross profit margins, even while Xoom offers much lower prices versus traditional money-transfer methods. And the compelling gross profits mean Xoom can spend aggressively on marketing to new customers and growing the business. Xoom estimates that the $47 it spent on average last year to gain each additional customer will generate $193 of gross profit over three years.

That marketing spending is worth the investment, as is research spending to develop service offerings like the firm's mobile app (which has seen rapid adoption, now used for 60% of the firm's transactions) and the industry's only remittance-funded international online bill pay service. All in all, you have a very scalable business with low capital requirements, an attractive payoff for each customer acquired, and a culture that's focused on serving customers' needs through a safe and secure platform.

Opportunity as Vast as the Oceans

Xoom enjoys about 20% market share in its most mature market, the Philippines. Across all markets Xoom has entered (including brand-new ones like China and Pakistan), the firm's market share is closer to 7%. That makes Xoom a significant player but also one with a lot of room to run, not only by continuing to expand the number of countries that can receive money but also eventually by allowing money to be sent from countries besides the U.S. as well. Xoom has yet to touch the vast majority of the remittance market — its $7 billion in customer transactions last year make up only about 1% of the $540-plus billion in global remittances calculated by the World Bank in 2013.

With a total market vastly larger than Xoom's current volume, the opportunity is essentially unbounded for the next decade or more. As the company focuses exclusively on digital money transfers, and its customer base grows increasingly aware of and satisfied with the faster, smoother, and cheaper digital transactions that Xoom provides, we see revenue growing 15% to 20% annually for the long term, which is the chief driver of our expectations of 20% or better annual returns from a Xoom investment today. In addition, although sales growth rates matter more than valuation multiples at this stage in its young life, it's trading around 3 times enterprise value to sales currently, on the low end of its brief history as a public company.

But remember to start small if you build a position: This is a higher-return opportunity, but it comes with less certainty, because Xoom's aggressive marketing and investments in new geographies will continue to crimp its margins. For a fast grower with high-return opportunities to attack, we think prioritizing reinvestment today is the right move for Xoom. That said, we do expect profits to expand faster than sales; if that proves the case, we'll likely find opportunities to recommend adding to a Xoom stake at lower risk (if higher prices) down the road.

Risks and When We'd Sell

Managing intense scrutiny and government regulation on the one side and the risks of fraud on the other are Xoom's central challenges. Its success to date suggests these risks are well contained, but the company obviously needs to remain vigilant — and we will, too. Xoom suffered from a fraud last year that cost the company more than $30 million of its own cash. The crime, a corporate phishing scam, was completely unrelated to Xoom's day-to-day business and never put customer information at risk, but it cost the company's new chief financial officer his job mere weeks after he started and served as a stark reminder of how paramount Xoom's risk controls are. If security breaches prove that Xoom's industry-leading loss rates aren't sustainable, we'll likely be nursing our losses as well.

More pressing risks stem from the competitive landscape. High customer retention is critical, and competition is fierce. Traditional transfer businesses Western Union and MoneyGram International (NASDAQ: MGI) have competing services, and they've tried to undercut Xoom's pricing in the past. Additionally, potential competitors like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and eBay's (NASDAQ: EBAY) PayPal have the financial resources to compete if they choose to enter this area. Xoom's customer retention and market share metrics show it's handling competitive pressures well so far, but if this disruptor becomes disrupted itself, we'll be looking to remit our investment funds elsewhere.",2

~Risk Management~

1) Never risk more than your initial investment
2) Limit the size of your trade positions (Diversify)
3) Close out of losing trades before they develop into large losses
4) Don't limit your profits by selling a winning trade with a small profit

~Technical Analysis~

1. Trade With the Trend  

This is perhaps the most important thing you can do to increase profitability. Many newbies try to 'time the bottom' and take bullish positions on stocks that are in downtrends. While you may get lucky every now and again, this is not a profitable strategy in the long run. It's just too hard to time the bottom. 

How do we trade with the trend?

We like to use a combination of moving averages to get an idea of the intermediate and long term price trends. 

-Intermediate Price Trend: We use the 50-Day EMA (Exponential Moving Average) and the 100-Day EMA. If the 50-Day EMA is above the 100-Day EMA, the stock is in an intermediate uptrend. If the 50-Day EMA is below the 100-Day EMA, the stock is in a downtrend. 

-Long Term Price Trend: We use the 1 month price and the 10 month SMA (Simple Moving Average). If the 1 month price is above the 10 month SMA, the stock is in a long term uptrend. If the 1 month price is below the 10 month SMA, the stock is in a long term downtrend. 

In order for us to take a bullish position on a stock, the underlying must be in both an intermediate and long term uptrend. 


2. Low-Risk Entry Points

-The 'Keltner Channels' are a valuable tool to use when deciding when to enter a stock. We wait for the stock to drop to the middle or lower Keltner Channel before purchasing it. When a stock that is in an intermediate and long term uptrend drops below the lower Keltner Channel, we consider that to be a High Probability 'Buy' signal. More times than not the stock will rally shortly after this occurs. 

-Slow Stochastic Bullish Divergence - This is another strong buying signal that occurs when the Slow Stochastic indicator produces two bottoms(below the 20 line) that slope upward, while the stock produces two bottoms that slope downward during the same period. This is a sign that the short-term sell off in the stock is nearing an end, and a sharp rally is likely to occur. Like the Keltner Channels, the stock must be in an intermediate and long term uptrend as well. 

~Option Strategies~

Many trader shy away from options because options are highly leveraged. If you want to have a chance to make real money in the market, we think options are the answer. We like to use a mix of different option strategies.

Bullish Option Strategies: 

- Call Option Purchase: We like to purchase call options on stocks/ETFs using the technical indicators discussed above. Purchasing calls is the riskiest strategy we use, so timing is especially important. We prefer using In-the-Money to deep In-the-Money strike prices, as using  these types of strikes gives us a greater chance of being profitable by expiration, as the stock does not have to move up as high for us to be profitable. 

- Call Option Debit Spread: This is one of our favorite strategies. Debit spreads allow us to profit if the underlying stock increases, remains flat, or slightly decreases by expiration. This strategy is favored during volatile time periods for fairly obvious reasons. Like call purchases, we want the underlying stock to be in an uptrend.

There is a lot more information I'd be happy to share if anyone is interested, but I need to head out for a bit. I hope some of you can benefit from this post.

What will I owe govt taxes on in the following scenario:

Sell transaction fee = $10

15-05-18,36ci20,From having £12 and a suit to buying a property in 6 months!,"I wanted to share my story and hopefully inspire others that may be a little behind credit wise or financially. Maybe life has thrown some obstacles at you? Having spent the last 4 years in America and having loads of adversity thrown at me I needed to hit the reset button on life and make some changes! During the last 4 years I have: Had my dream car repossessed, been fined $15,000, been to jail twice, been homeless and gone through a divorce. All of it, in fact happened during my last year in America.

I made the decision to start afresh, I had enough money for a plane ticket back to England and I already had a suit due to me being a banker. When I landed I checked my account to see what I had to play with for the next few weeks, £12! Oh well, a coffee and a bag of chips it is!

My very dream is to be able to work from home blogging and create passive income. It’s an absolute dream to do what you love and get paid for it. I hope to do just that, but for now, having just £12, I need a job!

The week before my flight I had arranged five interviews for when I was back in England, the very first interview was the very next day after I had landed. I had set it in my mind that I WAS going to get this job, nothing else in life mattered at that point, I had no money, no job but I was certain and determined to get this one job out of the five possible jobs I was going for.  I borrowed £100 from my brother to get up to London for these interviews, I had been well prepared for the interviews as I knew the job inside out, I was going for a Sales manager position at a health club. After the five first interviews and a round of second interviews I was offered 4 positions. The one job I wanted was included in that so I took it in a heartbeat, I started the very next day after being offered the job.

It took me two weeks to get a job and start it after landing. After building my team and implementing a high positive energy in the office we hit budget for the next consecutive 3 months meaning I would receive a bonus for each of the months! Phew, what a relief, after the second pay check now had a £1,000 in savings. I felt like the weight of the world was lifted off my shoulders.

So what do the next few months have in store for me? Well October and Novembers pay checks are going to be tasty, this should give me the money I need for a deposit on a 1 or 2 bedroom apartment somewhere outside of London. This will mean I am commuting to work each day but being able to own a property and pay less on a mortgage compared to rent makes it all worth it to me. I aim to have this done by December 2013, this will mean that after having landed in England with £12 and a suit, 6 months later I can potentially be a property owner!

I do however need to improve my credit so I am writing a lot about improving my credit score over on my blog. This should be done over the next couple of months, and coupled with a deposit and pay slips should ensure I get the flat I want!

Morale of the story, no matter what life throws at you, with a positive mindset and hard work you can make a choice to change your situation. As Zig ziglar said “Positive thinking won’t let you do anything, but it will let you do everything, better than negative thinking will”.

15-05-18,36eaol,"My CURE stock split 4:1 @ $157 today, will start @ roughly $39 on Wednesday. Play the evil investor!","**Long on this stock, short on American lives!** 

This has practically doubled year over year for about 3 years. A 3x leveraged bet for the entirety of the US health care system. Baby boomers aging and needing more care than ever. Younger Americans projected to be the fattest generation ever, ObamaCare providing the outreach to make all levels of care accessible to more people than ever. Or you just want to bet that Americans continue to be fat, sedentary, and unhealthy? Probably my most confident bet. I posted in r/investing earlier to make sure I understood the stock split and what it meant. 

TLDR: Consider buying CURE before 5/20/15(Wednesday), when it is scheduled to split 4:1, and the lower price brings in more retail investors. Obviously I'm long. Long on this stock &amp; shorting your life.

Play the evil investor: Your friends all smoke cigs? More fast food than supermarkets in your town? You can't stick to a workout plan for more than a month?

15-05-18,36eas3,SWKS - Skyworks,"Any opinions on Skyworks Solutions?  They have been on a fabulous tear.  I got in at a share price of $59 (Current price hovering around $103 today)...Bought a January 2016 $30 call for $28/share back in September...Sitting on a 319% annualized gain at the moment.  Closing out my position because ""sell in May and go away"".  

Let me elaborate a bit...The interest rate situation, combined with the typical market weakness in the coming quarter scares me a little.  My options expire in January, and with SWKS breaking new 52-week highs and a trailing PE of around 30, I don't see that I could gain much more by riding this option play out until expiration, but I do stand to lose a lot in a market pullback (whether its a crash or not, doesn't matter).

As a company, I think they are doing very well...If this were a long term stock play, I'd probably hold.  What do you guys think?  Selling now is the right move, or hold to expiration?

15-05-18,36edh7,Deciding my Roth IRA managing company.,"I read [this previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17sed8/roth_ira_account_ing_sharebuilder_vanguard_schwab/) about deciding your roth IRA account holder. There is strong support for Vanguard because of their lower expense ratios. Although the post is 2 years old I understand that there is still strong support for Vanguard.

[This recent post about possible Roth IRA holders](http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2007/06/07/how-to-start-a-roth-ira-and-where-to-do-it/) and [this other post as well](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/best-ira-accounts/) let me understand that there are plenty of solid options which offer low fees. For all the options, I was considering maxing my contributions so most of these no fees are applicable to my case.

I have a large portion of my money with BoA and a Merrill Edge CMA because of it's convenience to fund the account and because of my net worth allows 30 free trades every month. Therefore I am considering opening a ROTH IRA through Merrill Edge as well because of the convenience, but I would like to know other opinions. **If you comment, besides giving me just uninvested advice, could I also hear about what company you decided to work with and your personal opinion on the options available to you.**

15-05-18,36eevm,IQ Option - I think is a simple way to get some extra cash.,"A couple days ago I found out about a Binary Options Broker called IQ Option, and as I'm very interested in different aspects of investing I decided to give this a try (especially since the initial deposit only has to be $10). I invested $30, just so I could learn the game and get some strategy going (they also have an education section to teach you real strategies). So far I have gained a nice chunk of extra spending money (about $500), but it came with a lot of loss as well. I've learned this isn't a good way to try and make a lot of money, it won't get you rich, but it is great for some extra money and to learn more about market prediction. I don't know how to post images, but here are a couple examples of successful trades I've made:

Invested $50 - Gained $87.50
Invested $54.79 - Gained $95.88
Invested $5 - Gained $9.25

I don't know if this is allowed or not and I'm unsure if there are any restrictions with it, but on my profile there's a link and it says if you make an account from it you get $25 free to trade (http://tinyurl.com/kp5lgg7). Also, keep in mind like I said this will not get you rich what-so-ever and it's easier to lose than to gain, just learn the strategies before betting anything, and for the love of God don't bet anything you can't afford to lose. The only money that I've put in was extra money I had from tips at work. I hope you can be even more successful than me, I have profited about $500, but I've also lost a lot, like getting up to profit of $300 and then have a losing streak and going right back to $100, but that's also because I wasn't disciplined enough with my investing and because I didn't follow the strategy. 

Also, I didn't see anything about it in the rules, but if something is wrong with this post please either tell me, so I may remove the post myself, or let an admin know. Thanks and happy investing!",1

Given the fact that medallion prices peaked 1-2 years ago, one would expect some of their loans are already underwater, and the fact that restructurings and delinquencies have picked up corroborates this.  If one expects the value of taxi medallions to continue to erode, TAXI looks like a good short -- except for its fat dividend, which makes shorting it quite expensive.

15-05-18,36eioq,Stock Screening Help Desk,"To start off this thread I will go over what screening is and some basic strategies. I will then answer any questions you guys may have about screening, and help you construct and run your own screens. 


**My Background**

I work for EquitiesLab, as you can tell from the name of the account, and I have five years investing experience and about 4 months experience using screeners. What do I think of screeners? They are amazing. They make the process of looking for stocks to invest in a breeze, and have consistently helped me return more with less effort.  I personally use the Equities Lab platform because it is what I learned on and is incredibly comprehensive. However, there are a lot of screeners out there, and it is up to you to pick which screener works best for you. I will link a few different screeners in another section of this thread. 


**What is Screening?**

Screening is the process of sorting through a list of companies looking for certain financial criteria. This can be done by hand, but is extremely tedious and just not worth doing. WE HAVE COMPUTERS!!!! Let your machine best friend do all of the work for you. There are a ton of tools online both paid and free that allow you to search the market for certain criteria. So how does it work? Well there is a database of stocks saved on a server and each stock has a list of financial data that can be called by the program. Once you put in the parameters you want to search the database for the system will go through each stock looking for all of the stocks that fit the criteria you set. You will then be presented with a list of stocks that fit that profile. Now in some screeners, like equitieslab, each stock has all of its historical data, which allows you to backtest. Backtesting is when you simulate how well that strategy would have done if you had started using it at date X in the past. This is incredibly useful in testing to see if your strategy is even feasible, because if something has lost 10% every year for the past 20 years it isn't a strategy you want to implement, and you wouldn't know how poorly that strategy performed if you didn't run the backtest. So backtesting and screening are kind of married together and doing both is fairly important when choosing what to invest in. 


**Basic Strategies**

There are a ton of strategies when it comes to screening for stocks. However, when you first start screening it is best to use the strategies of the tried and testing. I'm going to go over a few different strategies that I personally used when I first started.

*Piotroski F-Score
The Piotroski F Score is a score from 0-9 that is a great indication of the fundamental health of a company. Many people will argue that fundamentals do not matter nearly as much as technicals, but the Piotroski F-Score has something to say about that. The score was developed by an accounting professor out of Chicago named Joseph Piotroski. He developed the simple, yet powerful score and realized that higher scoring stocks significantly outperformed the market as well as lower scoring stocks. The score is calculated by awarding one point for each of the following criteria the stock passes:

*O'shaughnessy Tiny Titans

Tiny Titans focuses on low-price micro-cap stocks. There has been much research done on the topic of investing in this area and this sector has continuously been shown to outperform the overall market.O’Shaughnessy believes that this out performance occurs because analysts aren’t typically following micro-cap stocks, and institutions such as mutual funds are unable to trade these stocks without moving the price. For this reason, micro-cap stocks have very little correlation with the overall market which opens up the possibility to use them as a hedging tool in a portfolio of larger stocks.


*There are a few more that I'll add when I have more time. I will also provide the specifics on each screener later in the day or tomorrow.


**Creating a Screener**

So you've decided you want to start using a screener to figure out what to invest in, but you have no idea where to start, and none of the above strategies appeal to you. Let's go over the steps I go through when developing a screener for myself. Below are the questions I ask myself when creating a basic screener.

*Is there a specific industry I want to invest in? ie. Biotechnology

*Is the company growing? ie. net income 1q &gt; net income 5q

*What is the minimum I'm willing to spend per share? ie. Close &gt; 20

*Is the price growing? ie. The change of the close over the past 90 days is over 10%

*What industry specific categories do I need? ie. The company is spending a minimum of $100 million every year on R&amp;D

The screen I just showed you is incredibly simple. Nevertheless it has made almost 300% in the past five years which equates to a little over 50% annually.

This was unlike the 2003-2007 bull market where the P/E decreased year over year.

There have been very few times in history when the S&amp;P 500 P/E exceeded 20. Either earnings have to grow rapidly (which has not happened so far) or prices have to fall. The ~32x reached in 1999 was an outlier and it ended badly.

I don't need to keep them for 40 year but I can.  Or I can keep them for 50 years.  Or 10.  I just want to add a few items that give dividends that I can then reinvest in other stocks that don't give dividends.  I don't care if it fluctuates in actual price because I am not looking to get profit from selling the actual stock but I want the long term tax free profit that comes from the dividends.",8

He now believes Apple to be worth $240 per share today, ([up from his $219 estimate in early February](http://www.shareholderssquaretable.com/letter-to-twitter-followers-regarding-apple/)), some 85% higher than today’s $130 per share price.

* Mr. Icahn remains much more optimistic on revenue contributions from iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, and the presently nonexistent Apple TVs than I am.

* Mr. Icahn also assumes a 20% efficient tax rate for valuation purposes, whereas I use 27% for FY15 and 28% for FY16 and FY17.

* At $130 per share, I believe Apple's 14% discount to the S&amp;P 500 on a forward P/E multiple is unwarranted, and should instead trade at a 15% premium.  (This gives it a forward P/E of 20 instead of 15.3)

I have been trading stocks but i have only been buying companies i feel are not to risky like (Disney, Expedia, Lockheed Martin, etc.) and have been doing alright but i feel like i don't spend enough time researching them. I also know how to program so i could get into algorithms.

15-05-19,36ia5o,Anyway to lock in a relatively small amount of (20-30k USD) EURUSD exposure in the US? Cash or derivatives.,"I am going to attend school in France this fall and I have about 20-30k EUR in tuition and fees to pay. I have been researching a way to hold some EUR and it's been more challenging than I expected since the amount is relatively small in the FX world. 

I settled on a World Markets account with EverBank earlier this year and thought it was a checking/savings account with easy way to pay directly in EUR. However when I tried to transfer some EUR money to pay for a small EUR liability this month I learned that it's actually an investment account so I had to pay a not so negligible transfer and foreign wire fee. 

I contacted my IRA broker Fidelity and they do not support holding cash in EUR. My brokerage account at Interactive Brokers requires a pretty hefty minimum that's beyond my reach currently.

I only locked in about a few thousand dollars at the previous 1.05 low and was staying on the parity train and hope I could convert more. It looks like Greece is starting to shake things up again despite the nice EU recovery so I'm going to get ready to scoop up some more EUR soon. If there's a better way to make my tuition payment later this fall as cheap as possible I'm open to suggestions.

This is my first post on Reddit, long time lurker. Just as some background, I'm 23 years old and a recent university graduate.

15-05-18,36fgpi,"L'Oreal to team up with Organovo to print 3D skin cells for product testing.","I met with the management of Organovo last fall during their roadtrip. ONVO differs in their 3D printing technology and yields a product that has a longer shelf life and less defects in production. Furthermore, they are the only company that can produce 3D assays (there are other ""3D bioprinters"" out there, but they can only print 2D or only a couple of cells thick).

Their liver assay is used in liver toxicity testing for new drugs. So instead of going to human trials to test for toxicity, pharmas can use Organovo to conduct research. If it's safe in the labs, they can then spend the money for human trials.

This stock is something to keep an eye on; it will likely be a takeout target. With EU nations banning animal testing for consumer products, multi-nationals like P&amp;G, Colgate-Palmolive, Unilever, etc will rely on ONVO going forward for product development and testing.

15-05-19,36j7rq,Dividend paying ETFs advice?,"So I started investing in the stock market last year and have broken pretty much dead even because of some smart and some stupid picks. The usual for a new investor. But my one big complaint is how much time I put into research and analysis. It just takes too much attention and I'm not sure that I want to invest the time to become a highly educated investor.

But I've got to do *something* with my money instead of leaving it in a chequing account, so I'm thinking that dividend paying ETFs may be the right way to go.

So I'm starting to do my due diligence research and was hoping that people could suggest some ETFs that might be worth considering. I have a couple criteria, but could be convinced otherwise:

* I don't want to invest in oil because I don't trust those markets.
* I'd rather not invest in the finance sector, though as a Canadian I suppose it would make sense to invest in Canadian banks.
* I think that there is interesting growth potential in emerging markets, but I don't know enough about them to judge whether an ETF would make sense.
* I'm not a big fan of American multinational corporations. Avoiding investing in them would be nice.

15-05-19,36g6d6,"Wanna get started trading? Here's how.","**A summary of the market of stocks can thou givest me?**

Google ""NFLX"" (the ticker symbol for Netflix, the on-demand movie-streaming service corporation). You will see it around the mid-$500s in a 1-day chart. Click ""max"" on the right side of the time-frame tabs. Move your mouse cursor to the pits of hell when it was around $60/share in 2012. Click, hold, and drag to its current price now, on the right. The % you see is the amount of money you'd gain off of however much you threw into it at that time.

* $1 x 800% = $8. Or...  
* $10 would've become $80,  
* $100 would've become $800,  
* $1,000 would've become $8,000,  
* $10,000 would've $80,000,  
* and so on, had you bought that corresponding amount of NFLX shares in 2011 and sat on it, picking your nose until today. (Not counting dividends as applicable.) Make money accordingly!

**Then one share canst be profitable, no? I need not much money to invest!**

Sure, at large prices like this (and including such a long wait, which is easily agonizing for 99% of non-Warren Buffett human beings). But if you want to trade a sub-$500 stock, then you're not going to get very far with one share, because your financial foes will kill you. So normal traders will *probably* need around $10,000+ to start (or at least $5,000+), if you want to do anything more than dabble and earn and lose mere pennies. You want to be able to do trades costing a rough minimum of $1,500 at a time.

**Those knaves! Who art thy devious financial foes?**

Four foes constantly poke at you:

* Your own broker (who will usually charge you a broker-specific commission fee of $5-10 for *EVERY buy and sell transaction*, whether you win or lose);  
* The SEC (at least one to a few pennies are scraped off of every single sale you make);  
* The Bid-Ask spread (market makers always set whatever-the-current-sell-price-is to at least 1¢ lower than whatever-the-current-buy-price-is); and, of course,  
* Uncle Sam (annual capital gains taxes)  

Tip: you can deduct from your taxes, or offset gains, by losing! Just as you can count capital *gains*, you can also count infinite capital *losses* (~~up~~ down to no ~~more~~ less than -$3,000/year, but losses roll over into future years. Ask your wickedly awesome CPA for more info).

**Lies there any way around these devious charges?**

One famous brokerage that's making other greedy stock brokers sweat bullets is the commission-free, currently-iOS-exclusive [Robinhood](http://www.robinhood.com). It will supposedly come to Android and also add a website platform sometime this year. ^Google ^Ventures ^is ^financially ^supporting ^it ^so ^I ^believe ^it ^is ^taking ^so ^long ^because ^Google ^may ^be ^trying ^to ^integrate ^Robinhood ^into ^Google ^Finance.

However, acc. to /r/robinhood (just what I've read of it, since I'm no Apple fanboy and have never used the broker), it has a *few* downsides:

* Listed financial data can be wildly inaccurate (even as basic as what today's High or Low was for a given stock, or its fundamental metrics)  
* Robinhood has [only a few order types](http://i.imgur.com/4D9h6Ah.jpg); it lacks trailing stops (an advanced order type that automatically, passively captures potentially better prices for you) and automated orders (like OCO—Order-Cancels-Order—or other self-automating triggers)  
* No shorting nor margin capabilities are available (without margin, brokers must lock up your money for 3 days after sales, on certain conditions)  
* Robinhood lacks after hours and pre-market trading  
* Some stocks are not available to trade (you may not be able to find your rapturous millionaire penny stock in the platform for whatever reason. Blast!)  
* Sometimes you cannot sell shares of your own holdings (this was supposedly fixed but another user reported this less than two weeks ago in /r/robinhood. The ""sell"" button literally disappeared at times and they couldn't sell their shares.)

**Just atrocious. I seek more powerful armament and shall deal death blows to thy enemies accordingly. How canst I trade more powerfully?**

Find a broker who can grant you a platform to execute trades (none of these will be crippled by any of Robinhood's current problems listed above). Try making a fake paper account with any of these brokerages and just start off virtually. My broker is [OptionsHouse](https://www.optionshouse.com/), which has an initially confusing layout but very possibly [the lowest commission fees](https://www.optionshouse.com/rates/compare/) out of all conventional US brokers. Others use:

* TD Ameritrade (which comes with a very powerful proprietary ""Thinkorswim"" stock analysis platform),  
* Scottrade,  
* E*Trade,  
* TradeKing,  
* SureTrader,  
* Interactive Brokers (non-US),  
* Questrade (epic for Canadians),  
* Motif Investing, and more.

On top of commissions (a flat fee per buy and sell, or a smaller, dynamic fee that changes based on how many shares you order), some of these brokers may charge you a monthly data fee*(for the real-time quote-streaming that they provide you), unless you meet a minimum activity quota each month. OptionsHouse has no monthly fees and will only charge you for filled orders.

Google all of these. Research their fees and capabilities and pick a good one. And let me know if you want to join OptionsHouse; don't sign up there yet because I have a referral link and can show you how to navigate the *entire* platform, as well as provide all the basics to trading on-the-go. I'll also send you my personal stock picks and analysis of ones you want to fire off to me.

**How shall I defeat thy foes?**

It's up to you. You can:

* Day-trade (*not recommended for beginners*): buy a share of [VALE](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=VALE) at $8.00, sell at $8.10, rinse, lather, repeat. This is one of multiple approaches called scalping and, when it comes to the raw numbers, it is as simple as that. Of course, once you actually try it, you see that timing is endlessly devious and even the world's very best day-traders basically have a 55% success rate. (*Edit:* Just FYI, this is a horrible % rate! Don't start with this approach.) You will need $25,000 to day-trade due to federal regulations. If you don't have that much, you can still carefully manage your unsettled funds and make approximately 3 or 4 potentially profitable day trades per week, IMO.

* Swing-trade: hold for days to months. Day-trading and swinging classify as short-term capital gains.

* Invest: Don't sell until a minimum of 366 days later after buying. Such investments are long-term capital gains (you get taxed at a lower rate, as opposed to short-term gains).

There are other methods but these are by far the most common.

**What research lies available unto thyself?**

Feel free to PM me to figure out potential entries. But first, type your ticker into Yahoo! Finance, [like so](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=GE). Click on *every* section on the left sidebar at least *once*. Google for the definition to *every* single term with which you're unfamiliar in Key Statistics and elsewhere. There also lie [FinViz](http://www.finviz.com), [Google Finance](http://www.google.com/finance), and many more hubs of data. As defined by Yahoo! Finance, you can treat the two forms of market analysis as:

Key Statistics ≈ Fundamental Analysis (how sound/secure/safe a company is)  
Interactive Chart ≈ Technical Analysis (how good its current position in its chart is)

* Fundamental analysis: helps you pick a good company. Is it in debt? (Hint: nearly all companies have debt.) How is it managing it and why? How is its earnings per share, price-to-earnings ratio, P/E growth, book value per share? What did its last financial statements look like? What do analysts like [Morningstar](http://www.morningstar.com) think of the stock?

* Technical analysis: helps you locate a good time to enter a company. Does the chart look like it's in a wedge that's just waiting to break out or collapse? Is it in a severe downtrend? Is it on an uptrend or flat-lining? What price ranges look like a resistance (price ceiling) or support (price floor) for it in the short-term, intermediate-term, or long-term? What recent news might cause it to fly or plummet? Decide if you like momentum-trading, bottom-feeding, value-investing, or any other mix of strategies.

You can assess a stock, its corresponding sector (like food or solar energy), or the entire market as a whole. Start doing your [DD](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp)! [Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com) is your new friend.

15-05-19,36g8s7,Why is it that the relative return of options increases when an option gets increasingly OTM? Seems like opportunity for arbitrage...,"So I built a program to examine the probable payouts of options at different strikes and premiums and one thing that I noticed is that the further out an option goes, the higher the relative return is.

For example, for the 5/22 strike for AAPL (this friday) at 126, the premium is $4.36. So the expected return is 10% on the option, which is 627.5% annually or 22.69% on a risk adjusted annual basis.

Sounds about right. Calculated as:

`relative risk = option delta * current price / option premium`

`adjusted return = mean return / relative risk`

`annual return = adjusted return / time until exp. (years)`

Now here's where it gets interesting. Let's make a table of the adjusted annual returns at each strike.


**AAPL CURRENT PRICE: 130.19**

Strike | Premium | Annual Adj. Mean Return
---|---|---
126 | 4.35 | 22.62%
127 | 3.40 | 27.97%
128 | 2.55 | 36.40%
129 | 1.77 | 48.80%
130 | 1.16 | 47.43%
131 | 0.72 | 56.57%
132 | 0.39 | 67.57%
133 | 0.20 | 81.71%
134 | 0.10 | 87.90%

So keeping in mind that these are ADJUSTED returns, isn't this a great opportunity for arbitrage?

I could sell a 126 call and buy 40 134 calls and I would have significant statistical arbitrage in the long run.


[Here's a link to all the data on the AAPL Calls that is visualized. The mean adjusted return is the last figure in each image.](http://imgur.com/a/93HVi) 

[And here's a gif of the returns to illustrate the difference in option returns.](http://cdn.makeagif.com/media/5-19-2015/fGxxIT.gif)

First: Congratulations on being trending! May your shares do the same!  
  
But what I've always wondered (and now finally ask actual investors) is why would anyone invest at all?  
I've asked my politics teacher(more like politics and economics, but meh) about that a few years ago and she told me 'investing is for rich people who don't mind losing a few millions', obviously she was exaggerating. But as I see it, those who actually are that rich should have some knowledge on economics and know whether you can make money with it or not - and if I understood the principle of it you will on average lose money because there are a) [up against computers](http://www.cnbc.com/id/44261909) that will act faster than you and better than you (unless they [fuck up](http://www.razerzone.com/press/detail/brand/razers-project-mcfly-cracks-wall-street-journals-top-april-fools-day-list)), b) because brokers take a share and c) because companies can go bankrupt but not reach an upper limit.

15-05-20,36ljf7,Euro/Japan and currency roulette,"No, I'm not talking about going all-in on amateur forex trading.  I actually like my money.

But what I am looking at for about a week is trying to wrap my head around the unknown of future currency values as it relates to foreign markets, for the following reasons.

Firstly, an assumption in all this...

*FACT: The Euro, Japanese, and Chinese markets have more upside than the US market for the next year*

With that in mind, I'm looking at particularly euro ETFs for some spare cash I have laying around but the million dollar question is whether to go currency hedged or not?  They are a lot more attractive with the option of 'not' (at least, they are more yolo with that option).

But there is a bit of a dangerous game here that the Fed is in charge of, the way I see it.  We already went through QE and fixed our economy post-2008, while the Euros dicked around with Germany strong-arming the whole continent and are just doing so all these years later.  

That leaves our friends at the Fed in a bit of a conundrum.  If they insist on increasing rates here before the Euro zone economy recovers, they will send the dollar to new highs and further hurt US commodity prices and US exporters.  

I don't think that's likely with an election year coming up.  

So if that's not likely, what are the currency value forecasts like for the rest of this year and into next?  We have seen a bit of dollar weakness in the past month but as long as a rate increase is on the table I don't think that the dollar will continue downward.  

But if the Euros are mimic'ing what we did, QE wise, they should see the same currency strength that we did as their economies recover, right?  And if rates don't come up here this year because of this situation, are they *surely* on the table for next year?

I think there's an argument in all of this (maybe) for having my non-yolo money in un-hedged Euro and Japanese ETFs instead of American ETFs for the next year particularly if there's more dollar weakness through the latter half of this year and next year.  But I can't convince myself that the dollar weakness is likely enough to do it.

Someone who knows more about currency values that me tell me what they think!",1

15-05-20,36ll7e,Went all in on May 29th SPY Puts @ 213 strike for $1.55.,"
Alright, here's some background. I am 20 years old and in my 2nd year of college majoring in finance. I did my first trade 6 months ago when I was 19 on December 5th where I bought 5  INTC calls where I lost big time. I have only had 1 successful trade in the last 20 option trades I have done. The only successful trade was on CBOE VIX where I bought 10 Puts @ 16 strike price for $.35 and sold at $.65, My account is down about 70% after being down 90%. So this trade will make or break it. If I make a profit off this trade, I'll add more RIG or maybe at PFE for dividends/growth over the next 5-6 years until I graduate. Probably RIG since they offer and amazing dividend, and I don't mind exposing myself to more risk long term. 

During this period of time, I also bought shares on a separate account where I have had amazing success.
Bought 30 shares of RIG @ $15.9
Bought 50 shares of SDRL @ 9
Bought 10 shares of HAL @ $42
Bought 5 shares of GILD @98
Bought 20 shares of INTC @ 37,2 
Thank you oil. Not going to sell, as I'm leaving these for 5+ years. 

What I have learned in this period of time.
* It is better to overall miss a trade, then to rush into one.
* When you enter into a trade, ALWAYS have an exit price. 50% on options. 
* Never beat yourself up over a big loss, or any loss. PERIOD
* Take a few week break from the market, after a losing spree.
*Never buy when there's been 3 or more bullish candle sticks in a row, Just wait it out, and wait for a 1% sell off. 

*Listen to Icahn and buy AAPL 2 year Leaps
*YOLO AMD ONLY WAY TO MAKE MILLIONS
*
P.S I own 80 shares of AMD when they crashed in 2008. I bought in at $3.85. Still holding on to them because AMD = LIFE. Seriously, AMD was my favorite company when I was growing up because I was an AMD fanboy. 

During this period of time, I've been working on a program with python that automatically analyzes the lowest monthly and daily lows of VIX, and calculates the probability that a volatile event occurs compared to every month in the last 25 years. I have gathered some really cool information like, signals before crashes, volatility when presidents change, and so on. Nothing new, but still fun on working on it. 

Reasons to buy puts on SPY
1. Bearish candle stick today
2. Reversal on 5 day RSI
3. Touched bollinger bands
4. Currently no economic data to support this pushing
5. Gold was rising
6. Dollar had gains


Worries
1. Bond's keep dropping
2. Economic events this week
I am an expert at buying high, and selling low. So I'm going all in on SPY Puts 3 @ 213. Before, I would be buying at this time. So this time I'm doing the opposite of what I really want to do. Wish me luck, hope SPX drops by 20 - 25 points at some point in the next week and a half.

15-05-20,36lppi,"Start Investing With Only $1,000","So you have $1,000 set aside, and you're ready to enter the world of investing. However, before you jump headfirst into the world of stocks and bonds, there are some things to consider. One of the biggest considerations for investors with a minimal amount of funds is not only what to invest in but also how to go about investing. Not long into your investment journey, you may find yourself bombarded with minimum deposit restrictions, commissions and the need for diversification, among a myriad of other considerations. In this article, we'll walk you through getting started as an investor and show you how to maximize your returns by minimizing your costs.

**What Are the Account Minimums?** 

To the inexperienced investor, investing may seem simple enough - all you need to do is go to a brokerage firm and open up an account, right? What you may not know, however, is that all financial institutions have minimum deposit requirements. In other words, they won't accept your account application unless you deposit a certain amount of money. Some firms won't even allow you to open an account with a sum as small as $1,000.

**Stocks**
Stockbrokers come in two flavors: full-service and discount. As the name implies, a full-service broker provides much more in the way of service, but it only deals with higher net-worth clients. It's common to see minimum account sizes of $50,000 and up at full-service brokerages.

This leaves the $1,000 investor with the option of a discount broker. Discount brokers have considerably lower fees, but don't expect much in the way of hand-holding. Fees are low because you are in charge of all investment decisions - you can't call and ask for investment advice. With $1,000, you are right on the cusp in terms of the minimum deposit. Some discount brokers will take you and others won't. You'll have to shop around.

You also could purchase shares directly from a company through direct stock purchase plans (DSPPs). Some of these plans have a minimum investment amount restriction, which ranges between $100 and $500.

With the advent of online trading, there are a number of discount brokers with no (or very low) minimum deposit restrictions. One of the most popular online trading sites is Scottrade. You will, however, be faced with other restrictions and see higher fees for certain types of trades. This is something an investor with a $1,000 starting balance should take into account if he or she wants to invest in stocks.

**Mutual Funds and Bonds**
If mutual funds or bonds are investments you would like to make, it is simpler in terms of minimum deposit amounts. Both of these can be purchased through brokerage firms, where similar deposit rules apply as for stocks. Mutual funds also can be purchased through your local bank, often for less than $1,000 when you have an existing relationship with the bank.

If you want to purchase government bonds, this can be done straight from the government through TreasuryDirect. The only restriction here is the minimum purchase amount of the bond, which can range from $100 to $1,000.

**Learn the Costs of Investing**
Before you open an investment account, you must also consider the costs that you will incur from purchasing investments once the account is open. In most cases, every time you purchase an investment, it will cost you money (through commissions). With a limited amount of funds, these transaction fees can really put a dent on your $1,000.

Investing in stocks can be very costly if you trade constantly, especially with a minimum amount of money available to invest. Every time that you trade stock, either through buying or selling, you will incur a trading fee. Trading fees range from the low end of $10 per trade, but can be as high as $30 for some discount brokers. Remember, a trade is an order to purchase shares in one company - if you want to purchase five different stocks at the same time, this is seen as five separate trades and you will be charged for each one. 

Now, imagine that you decide to buy the stocks of those five companies with your $1,000. To do this, you will incur $50 in trading costs, which is equivalent to 5% of your $1,000. If you were to fully invest the $1,000, your account would be reduced to $950 after trading costs. This represents a 5% loss before your investments even have a chance to earn a cent!

If you were to sell these five stocks, you would once again incur the costs of the trades, which would be another $50. To make the round trip (buying and selling) on these five stocks would cost you $100, or 10% of your initial deposit amount of $1,000. If your investments don't earn enough to cover this, you have lost money by just entering and exiting positions.

**Mutual Fund Fees**
There are many fees an investor will incur when investing in mutual funds. One of the most important fees to focus on is the management expense ratio (MER), which is charged by the management team each year, based on the amount of assets in the fund. The higher the MER, the worse it is for the fund's investors. It doesn't end there: you'll also see a number of sales charges called ""loads"" when you buy mutual funds.

In terms of the beginning investor, the mutual fund fees are actually an advantage relative to the commissions on stocks. The reason for this is that the fees are the same, regardless of the amount you invest. Therefore, as long as you have the minimum requirement to open an account, you can invest as little as $50 or $100 per month in a mutual fund. The term for this is called dollar cost averaging (DCA), and it can be a great way to start investing.

**Reduce Risk with Diversification**
Diversification is considered to be the only free lunch in investing. In a nutshell, by investing in a range of assets, you reduce the risk of one investment's performance severely hurting the return of your overall investment. You could think of it as financial jargon for ""don't put all of your eggs in one basket.""

In terms of diversification, the greatest amount of difficulty in doing this will come from investments in stocks. This was illustrated in the commissions section of the article, where we discussed how the costs of investing in a large number of stocks could be detrimental to the portfolio. With a $1,000 deposit, it is nearly impossible to have a well-diversified portfolio, so be aware that you may need to invest in one or two companies (at the most) to begin with. This will increase your risk.

This is where the major benefit of mutual funds comes into focus. Mutual funds tend to have a large number of stocks and other investments within the fund, which makes the fund more diversified than a single stock.

**A Small Step Toward a Large Future**
It is possible to invest if you are just starting out with a small amount of money. It's more complicated than just selecting the right investment (a feat that is difficult enough in itself) and you have to be aware of the restrictions that you face as a new investor. 

**The Bottom Line**
You'll have to do your homework to find the minimum deposit requirements and then compare the commissions to other brokers. Chances are you won't be able to cost-effectively buy individual stocks and still be diversified with a small amount of money. Given these restrictions, it's probably worth starting out on your investment journey with mutual funds. However, like all aspects of investing, it's up to you to do the research and figure out the strategy that suits you best.

15-05-20,36lq6p,The Best Investment EVER!,"Apple’s shares have skyrocketed to almost $700 each today, after they announced pre-orders of the iPhone 5 have reached in excess of 2 million units!!! Comparing this to the iPhone 4 which obtained 600,000 pre-orders and the iPhone 4S of 1 million – this is HUGE! What is more, the company’s shares have risen over 70% this year… WOW!
Furthermore, analysts have predicted that Apple could sell 10 million units by the end of the month and 50-60 million by the end of this year!
Consider Apple’s stock over the last 10 years: (if you are new to investing, not many company’s stock charts look like this)
 Best Investment
Apple Inc. Stock
September 2002 – $7.25 per share
September 2012 – $696.25 per share
To put this in perspective, if you invested $1000 in Apple ten years ago, you would have $96,034.50 today – a gain of 9600%!! Not bad huh? The question is, where does it stop? If you had stock in apple back in 2007 / 2008 you might have thought that the drop that was to come would finish apple. Oh how disappointed you would have been if you sold your shares.
You need an awful lot of money in the first place to invest in a company like apple when an ordinary share is priced so high.
I know of a guy that put £10k into Apple 10 years ago… that was the best investment decision EVER!

15-05-20,36oc70,Questions about an IPO,"I'm looking to invest in shopfiy for reference. And I am Canadian.

I have a few questions!

-When a stock is listed as going up on both the tsx and nyse does it go up at the same time? If not would it being bought up on the nsye effect be ipo price within the tsx.

-When the stock actually does its IPO let's say for example's sake the 22nd, does the stock go up for sale right at midnight or is there an agreed upon time?

-The IPO is estimated to be around 16$ USD. How would that translate in the tsx? Would each stock be the Canadian equivalent to to 16$usd?

I may have a few follow up questions but thanks for the help in advance!

15-05-20,36od1y,Where do you see the tobacco industry heading?,"Tobacco companies has been around for decades and offers some great dividends and some individual companies have seen fantastic growth, but im wondering how much tobacco use is going to realistically decrease in the next several decades? Here in europe its astounding how many people from different social classes and ages still smoke (i have nothing against smoking) given all the health related issues and of course the economic cost of smoking. Ive recently held PM (sold after previous earnings) and looking hard at opening a position in MO but im still unsure due to several factors like..

1) how big is smoking in america as a part of the culture? In most european countries its not uncommon to take breaks at school and work to smoke

2) the hopefully eventual legalization of marijuana would be a massive business opportunity for a large tobacco company like MO but when could this realistically happen nationwide?

3) What if marijuana only becomes legal in 25 states (just an example) would large tobacco companies officially enter the market or wait until full legalization?

i would love to hear your thoughts and why you are/are not investing in tobacco companies! ",1

In New Zealand we have a government initiative which assists with retirement savings called Kiwisaver. In the program I have to select specific approved funds. I'm fine with turbulence, as this is for the long term. I'd like something which will provide good long term growth.

These are the funds I've settled on, but I'm having difficulty choosing which one. Their primary investments (i.e. Australasian shares, Vanguard indexes etc) are listed at the bottom.

Question is this - what is the risk to buying a high-volume, fast moving stock, usually running on new news or recovering from dip, and immediately putting a stop-loss order for the same price (a few cents or a fraction of a percent depending) less you bought it for? 

I know that in a matter of seconds or mins that it can dip below.... in that case you just get your original investment back (even though having the money tied up for 3 days is kind of a pain not the end of the world).

I know that in a catastrophic event that it might sell for a bit less than the stop-loss order price, but in my experience so far that has never happened.

I definitely see some activity from 1981 to 1986 in their changes (#s 43-70). Are any of these ACTUAL changes to the reserve requirements? Which data point in 1981 is the latest change to the reserve requirements that Zweig was mentioning? I cannot understand why M. Zweig mentioned that the Fed didn't touch reserve requirements since '81 when I can clearly see that there are data points between '81 and '86.

I find this important because although reserve requirements may not be as relevant as they used to be, I would still like to be able to completely follow what the author is explaining. 

Thanks so much for any help any of you can provide!",1

15-05-21,36qbt3,10 Things An Investor Must Do Before Investing,"Investing in private companies is not easy. These are risky, illiquid, long-term investments, so you need to do a lot of work upfront to increase your odds of success. I’ve spent my entire career either investing into private companies or helping investors and companies connect through an online investing platform. In my experience, here are 10 things investors must to before investing:

**1) Talk with the CEO**.  When we first launched our equity crowdfunding platform, I was amazed that some online platforms were selling large chunks of pre-IPO Facebook shares, without providing investors access to the company’s financials or the opportunity to speak with CEO Mark Zuckerberg. You really should not invest in a private company without first talking to the CEO. How can you bet on the team if you haven’t talked with them? This is why we facilitate conversations through conference calls and our online forums. Speaking with the CEO will give you invaluable insights into leadership’s vision and ability to execute.

Do you share the vision and values of the CEO of the company? Reading about a company can never be as valuable as a conversation with the CEO. A friend of mine once heard an impassioned pitch from a CEO who had an intriguing company, but he spoke in militaristic metaphors about the marketplace as a battleground and the need to defeat competitors. His approach toward his market and his appeal to investors on military terms was off-putting. Prospective angel investors would never have known that had they not talked to him face-to-face.
Can the CEO and leadership team execute their vision? There are plenty of great business concepts and product ideas out there. It is in the execution phase where most companies stumble. You have to talk to a CEO to truly understand the risks associated with execution and to decide if you believe in the company and the CEO’s ability to deliver results.

**2) Have a Diversification Strategy (and execute on it).** It’s unlikely you will be a successful private investor if you’re putting money in just two or three companies. Data from the Kauffman Foundation suggests a sound approach is to have seven to 10 investments. The Angel Investment Performance Project, released by the Kauffman Foundation, found that angel investors generally had nine years of experience and averaged just over one investment per year. You need to determine how much you want to allocate to this asset class and then diversify your investments to reduce risk and increase your odds of success.

**3) Talk to an expert.** Find someone who knows the industry that interests you. I would recommend consulting a professional investor in the space or an investment banker focused on the category. Don’t know one? Start looking on LinkedIn – spending a few hours networking will help you realize there were questions you didn’t know you should ask.

**4) Talk to customers.** The more customer data you can get, the better. At a minimum, you should talk to three to five customers who use the product. You want to understand from first-hand users what’s to like about the product and what void does it fill. Is there an alternative product that customers say they would consider using in place of the product? Why or why not? What if a competitor drops prices—would they remain loyal? Most importantly, would they recommend the product? Customers come in three flavors: promoters who are loyal, will recommend a company’s products and services, and can help fuel growth; passives who are indifferent and easy pickings for competitors; and detractors who are unhappy and actively criticize. (In an ideal world you would do a Net Promoter Score survey, but that may not be realistic in every situation). Pay attention to the types of customers a company has; it’s a good sign if you hear them actually promoting the products they’re using.

**5) Understand growth.** How is the company growing and how will it continue to grow?  Has the business grown by acquiring distribution or has it been successful increasing sales at the same stores? Organic growth (read: same store sales growth) is far more valuable than buying growth. Obviously, to understand growth, an investor has to dig into the key financial statements—the balance sheet, income statement, and cash-flow statement. In the consumer sector you can ask for retail level sales (i.e. SPINs data) to help answer that question.

**6) Know the exit strategy.** Know the exit scenarios for the industry that interests you. How big will the business need to be, and with what margins, to go public or be an attractive acquisition target? If an IPO is not in its future, who are potential buyers when it reaches that ideal scale?

In consumer and retail, IPOs are more rare than tech, so at CircleUp we always ask: “Who will buy this business in 5 years?” M&amp;A is actually more common in consumer than in other industries. The value of M&amp;A in the consumer space was nearly double the value of Internet and software deals in 2012, according to the most recent year-in-review data from PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP.

**7) Talk with your lawyer. ** Legal documents associated with investing in private companies are complicated. Show every document to your lawyer for feedback.  You may not care about all of your lawyer’s points, but you should understand them.

**8) Understand the business.** Follow Peter Lynch’s investment maxim “Invest in what you know.” Before investing in a company, use the product, study the business. Lynch invested in Hanes in the early 1970s because his wife liked its L’Eggs pantyhose line. The better you understand the business, the more confident you’ll feel about your investment. Why would you invest in a tech company if you don’t have a tech background?  Do you understand how to diligence the next hot mobile app or the technology trends that will impact it? Stick to what you know well.

**9) Calculate the per unit economics.** Amazingly, many companies in recent years have attracted investors despite the fact that they lose money on each “unit” they sell. Sadly for their investors, many of these companies also have no plan to change that situation. If you’re investing in a beverage company, you should understand how much it makes—or loses—on each bottle. The formula is simple: revenue minus full costs, including marketing and distribution costs.

**10) Know the deal.** Determine how a company’s valuation and deal structure stacks up against others in the industry. Look at the valuation relative to comparable companies based on multiple factors, including revenue, net income, growth rate, risk profile and capital structure. Good companies are not always good investments—especially if the valuation is too high. As Warren Buffett once said, “Never count on making a good sale. Have the purchase price be so attractive that even a mediocre sale gives good results.”

Because we’ve had over a thousand companies apply to my equity crowdfunding site, we’re in a unique position to help provide data that investors need to benchmark consumer-goods companies against their peers. That’s a good start but the key is to do your diligence.  Ultimately, any investor needs to obtain as much information as possible about the business, the industry and the deal. There are no sure bets, but the more you know, the better your odds of success.

15-05-21,36qchl,"Can someone please explain how VIX derivatives work in layman terms? i.e. SVXY, XIV, UVXY, &amp; TVIX","I am very interested in learning more about how these VIX based securities actually work. There is very little information readily available, let alone readable for the average investor.

The more detailed explanation you all can provide me the better. However, I want to stress that I would like an explanation that myself and others can actually understand and follow. 

(I understand there may be some concepts that must require more in-depth knowledge based on multiple levels of concepts that make up these complex derivatives. That being said, if this is inevitably the case, please link to material that said base concepts can be referenced to. But obviously if you can adequately explain these base concepts here, and in plain english, that is preferred.)

Please feel free to correct me if i'm far off, but i'll first explain how I think these derivatives function.

Lets start with the VIX. From what I understand, the VIX, otherwise known as the ""fear index"" is an overall indicator of perceived market volatility based on S&amp;P 500 options contracts for a 30 day period, meaning an indicator of how much the overall market may go up or down in the next 30 days.

So, for example, if the VIX is at 15, one could figure out how much the market is expected to move up or down by doing the following. 
-Because the actual VIX level is an annual representation, one must deannualize it, or rather boil it down to look at it on a monthly basis
-One would divide .15 (15%) by the square root of 12, to get the monthly outlook (I don't understand why its divided by the square root of 12, rather than just 12)
-This would equal .0288, or about 2.9% monthly outlook
-So, this would tell you that the market is perceived by investors to either go up or down by 2.9% over the next 30 days
That is my basic understanding of what a given VIX number actually means

(Most of my understanding of the VIX comes from blog posts from a guy named Reid Steadman on Indexologyblog.com, here is a link to a list of his posts http://www.indexologyblog.com/author/reid_steadman/)

Finally, Steadman argues that the VIX is mode (not mean) reverting and that a VIX level hovering around 13 (how ironic for a fear index) is most typical. (data Steadman used in the article was calculated using all 2,517 trading days in which the VIX had existed up until the article was published on May 23, 2014)

So, that is in a nutshell how I think I understand how the VIX works.

Now to the VIX derivatives. 

From what I understand, SVXY is an ETF that operates inversely to the VIX, meaning that if the VIX goes down SVXY goes up. My understanding is also that just so long as the market doesn't go down, SVXY will gradually rise in value. Meaning that in a stagnant market, SVXY is still a good bet. My thinking on SVXY has been that i'm basically betting over that longer term (lets say over the next 1-3 years) that there won't be another depression/recession or global catastrophe, resulting in an overall stable market and low levels of volatility over the long term. 

(I get that if something does go wrong [i.e. another recession/catastrophe] then a significant amount of SVXY value will be wiped out. However, my thinking is that if this were the case, then everyone would be screwed. Screwed, in that, in such a situation, almost all stocks would lose significant value. An example would be if I were to be holding something as simple as a share of Bank of America [lets just ignore for now BofA's issues of fines or other issues that could make it go down otherwise, for the sake of this conversation] or Starbucks, in that both of these lost tremendous valued during the 2008 financial crisis.)

(my understanding is that XIV basically does the same thing as SVXY, but is an ETN, and therefore inherently has slightly more risk due to the idea of 'Counterparty Risk'. Counterparty risk meaning that if XIV's Credit Suisse went bankrupt, its backed ETN's would be worthless. Whereas an ETF [i.e. SVXY] would retain some value even if its backer went under, albeit very little value)

My understanding of UVXY and TVIX is that they are 2X volatility ETF's that essentially move with the VIX. If the market does poorly, or if there is some sort of short term global catastrophe, these two will do well. But from what I have seen, although these two can, and indeed do, periodically have big gains, they are all short lived relative to the big picture (going off the basis of a 1-3 year time horizon)
-I really don't quite understand what i'm about to describe, but from what I think i've discerned from numerous articles i've read, it looks as if the actual structuring of these derivatives (UVXY and TVIX) makes it so that they are built to lose value over time (assuming a stable market). I kept thinking that numerous reverse splits over the last 3 years were an indicator of this idea being true. 

I also remember reading an article (which i've list below) about the creator of the VIX saying he thought that these derivatives were essentially built to fail, saying, “virtually guaranteed to lose money through time.” If this is in fact the case, would it not logically make sense to bet against these derivatives, either through shorts, puts, of buying an inverse volatility eft (i.e. SVXY)?

http://blogs.barrons.com/focusonfunds/2014/06/27/vix-creator-shocked-appalled-at-volatility-etfs-backs-a-competitor/

Additionally, I was curious as to why anyone would want to buy something like UVXY or TVIX if they are so likely to lose value. From what I surmised, I believed that hedge funds and other large institutional investors buy these to keep in their back pockets basically as doomsday insurance. In that, holding these, in case of a global financial meltdown and/or global catastrophe, would essentially hedge their overall portfolio in this particular (even if unlikely) scenario. 

I also would guess that day traders try to utilize UVXY and TVIX in anticipation of high market volatility.

With all this in mind, i'm thinking my strategy will be to buy slightly out of the money 9 month SVXY call options. I feel like 9 months will provide enough time to weather through any sort of relative short term market shock/scare and provide a clear path towards profitability. (I realize that if something bad does happen in the market, this strategy will obviously not work, and will in fact fail miserably. But again, i'm betting that the sky will not fall in the relative long term.)


I know that was very long and I appreciate all who took the time to read this. To clarify, these are my understandings of how the VIX and its derivatives function from my reading of numerous financial articles over the past 3 years. However, said materials are limited and not written for the average investor (or for that matter fairly advanced investors, in that I think the VIX is a pretty obscure thing to most investors, not to mention its derivatives) more often than not providing little clarity on overall functionality. So without further adieu, please provide me constructive criticism and enlightenment.

15-05-21,36spt7,"Fuck ISR, keep sticking your dick in HABT","For reals though, I've been sexing up the burger train since it left the station.   Near $30 I tripled my position, bought some more yesterday because I was already wasting money on penny stocks, why not add to the burger bonanza.

So far HABT is fucking killing it.   They opened options like two days ago, but the markets are fucked.  Once they tighten a bit it's premium selling time.  [Let the boring grind of CC commence!]   (Don't mention SHAK, that's unsustainable to me, I'm not touching it.)  HABT on the otherhand has 13.7% same store comp growth in Q4 and 12.8% same store comp growth in Q1.   That's CMG numbers.  Love it.

And, now having mentioned holding equities, I apologize for upsetting your yolobilities.

15-05-21,36r8vk,My experience and criticism of Vanguard Personal Adviser services and why in the easily avoidable deal breaker.,"I recently looked into Vanguard Personal Adviser services.   They put together a portfolio for me which I think was pretty good and got me thinking differently about asset/account placement.  I have taxable brokerage, rollover IRA and Roth. The portfolio was generally along these lines:

Taxable:  Vanguard Total Market or VTI 60% Vanguard Total Intl or VXUS 40%

Rollover IRA:  Total International Bond 18%
Short Term Bond  22%
Total Bond 60%


Roth: was more or less a broken out aggressive target date fund keeping some ETF's I had already picked.

The most striking thing about this to me was that there are no bonds in the taxable account but I can see the logic in this as a way to keep income and income taxes lower.   I was surprised to see Rollover was 100% bonds but I guess I can see the logic.    You don't want huge gains in the account where you will ultimately be taxed so better to push your less aggressive investments there and hope for bigger gains in the tax free forever Roth.


The ultimate deal breaker and I'm sure they will end up changing this was how the quarterly fee is levied. Shockingly, they keep you 100% invested in the taxable account.  So every quarter they sell some funds to pay for the fee.  So while not huge, you'll have potential gains every quarter.   This seems to go against buy and hold in my opinion.   This is easily remedied by keeping a 1% cash position to cover annual expenses and only reinvesting an appropriate amount of dividends.

They've been chugging along for months, and until this price war fiasco they've been sitting comfortably in their upward trend.  They're a good airline, people love them, seems pretty bullet proof.  Now yesterday they took that big hit but *all* the airlines did.  My gut tells me that this is a market overreaction and they'll be back on the rise soon enough, but then again my gut told me PTBI was gonna break out past 11 yesterday, so my brain doesn't know what to think!

My current plan is to buy in after a day or two of $20.5+, cause it's unlikely to get caught under $20 if it makes it back up there.  At least I think so.  Is my logic sound?  What are y'alls thoughts?  

Forgot to add my fears - it dipped under it's lower trend and hit the 200 ema.  [This is what I'm looking at.](http://i.imgur.com/dL7FRni.png)  Now, should I consider this to be a reversal of the trend (like I usually would) or should I chalk it up to the industry-wide drop?  ",13

My teammate just posted a short blog about ELTP.
I thought you may also be interested, thanks!

Valuating Elite Pharmaceuticals
 Author: AJ Sails

With the increasing number of small pharma’s being scooped up by much bigger fish lately, there has been much talk about the true valuation of Elite Pharmaceuticals, so I thought I’d chime in and offer up my .02 cents. But this time, we’re going to keep it really simple.
Normally, valuating a company takes hours of research. Fortunately, for us, the work has already been done, so why and reinvent the wheel?
Using the independent valuation which was conducted by the company last fall of a conservative .40, a likely $2.10, and a best case scenario of $2.75 per share, all at the full issued share count of 995,000,000, then simple math says the company’s valuation is higher with current share count issued.
The table below shows Elite’s valuation at current share count, at 75% and 100% issued share count. Multiple anti-abuse product launches would make Elites valuation much higher.

It would get me about $1.50 per call ($300 cash baby!), lowering my basis to somewhere around $127.50.

I doubt the stock is going to hit 140 before July, but is my risk worth the $300? Even if I ""lose"" my shares it would still be about a 10% gain.

15-05-21,36tf8w,Life Insurance and Index Fund Combo,"I'm looking for a very long term, very safe investment option to complement my more aggressive investment choices. What I was offered is essentially an index fund that caps out on 13% growth per year, but has a 0% floor, so I won't lose any money when the market takes a dive. They apparently tack on the life insurance aspect in order to make this legal from what I was told.

The disadvantages are that I would miss out on growth if the S&amp;P grows more than 13%, that I won't make any money on this for at least 5 years due to early management/insurance fees, and I have to pay insurance fees on it every year. But, these fees don't amount to much in the overall scheme of things, do get me decent life insurance that I could borrow from, and I think they are worth it in order to have money safely tucked away that cannot be affected by market downturns. The only real risk I can see is if the insurance company, such as Life Insurance Company of the Southwest, goes out of business, in which case I would likely lose everything,  but that seems very unlikely. 

Overall, it seems like a fantastic investment for retirement, and I can't see any reason besides what I listed above why not to go for it. But I'm skeptical, am I missing something here?

I'm very young and have no need of the money I'd be putting into this thing, which I'd likely leave alone for quite a while. I have other investments, such as mutual funds that cover sectors, a few individual stocks, and an existing index fund (from which I'd likely fund this new choice).

So has anyone heard of these kinds of Life Insurance/Index Fund combo? Why wouldn't someone want to go for it besides the reasons listed above?

I'm just passing on my knowledge in the hopes to inspire someone to invest or make the leap into the stock market. I believe EVERYONE should have investments. Investments aren't only made in the stock market, buying a house is an investment in the real estate industry, buying a business is an investment in a certain industry (depends on the business you buy), reading a book is an investment in YOURSELF, etc. Sadly our school system in America does not teach us how to properly manage our money. It is the lack of knowledge which leads to bad monetary decisions. Wealth is attainable by everyone. Anyways, this is pretty much a run down of my trading methods and my knowledge upon trading STOCKS. This is only for STOCKS, options, forex, bonds, may or may not apply. I shall be focusing on STOCKS. This is simply my take on investing, there are THOUSANDS of books you can read upon investing. Personally, I think nothing beats experience. The best way to learn is to get in there and lose some money!


I use a technical analysis approach upon my investments, I swing trade and if opportunity is provided I day trade.


For starters, you want to get familiar with all the terminology. At this point you don't want to worry about trading stocks. You have to take baby steps, you don't learn how to run before you learn how to walk do you? You want to learn terms such as: Bullish and Bearish markets, ticker symbols, trend-lines, support and resistance levels, positive trends, negative trends (how do you identify these trends), technical analysis, fundamental analysis, differences between stocks, forex, bonds, etc., equity, margin trading, margin calls, candlesticks, candlestick patterns, and MUCH MORE. This is only some of the terminology that I can think off at the moment. Most importantly, you need to know the terminology in order for things to make sense. What does shorting a stock mean? What is a long position? Short Position? 

The amount of knowledge you have at the ends of your fingertips is fucking RIDICULOUS! Use it to your advantage! 
I recommend websites like Investopedia:

Learn the differences between sectors within the stock market. Are you investing in the energy sector, technology sector, industrial sector, or consumer sector. These are just some sectors within the market. Ever heard the saying ""Don't put all your eggs in one basket""? Diversify! Diversify within the various SECTORS (see how it all correlates together?) if the industrial sector goes DOWN you shouldn't worry because you have some investments in the technology sector, which is on it's way UP! But if you had all your money in the industrial sector, then you're shit out of luck and you're going to quit the market. If you put all your eggs in the one basket, you put all your efforts or resources into one person, one thing or one plan, and if things don't work out, you lose everything! On a side note: (not relating to the stock market) Be independent, don't depend on others. Friends are great! They won't always be there, be happy with who you are and don't depend upon the acceptance of others. On to our next topic! Nobody likes losing! 

Cut your losses short!
Lots of people CHOOSE to hold on to losing stocks. If you're stock pick has gone down 20% from purchase price, what the hell are you waiting for? CUT THAT SHIT! It might go back up, it has happened to me, and it fucking sucks, I know... but you know what sucks even more? Selling at a 50% investment loss, don't be that guy. If you're going to fail, FAIL FAST. It's ALWAYS ALWAYS easier said than done, money has this nice way of gripping you by the balls. Lose your emotions, they don't help in the market. We all experience emotions, it's the people who can control their emotions that win this game.There are thousands of opportunities within the market, you just have to find them. This is an emotionless game, leave that shit at the door. If I'm winning, you might be losing, if i'm losing... you're winning. This is business.

Cut those losses!
http://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/08/capital-losses.asp

Develop a strategy and stick to it:
What strategy are you going to use? Heads up: There is no fail-safe strategy. If you create a strategy stick to that shit. Set a stop-loss at 10% if you reach that stop-loss let it go. Let your winners run. Are you basing your strategy upon fundamental analysis or technical analysis? You don't know what that is? Look it up, I don't spoon feed. You want to win in this game? Work you r ass off. You know what time it is? 11pm, you know what I'm doing? Analyzing stock charts, and writing this.

Differences Between Fundamental and Technical Analysis: http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/131.asp 

Learn about support and resistance levels. These are GREAT indicators of buying or selling. If a stock is at it's support level and seems to be picking up on a up-trend, buy that shit like it's free! if it's at it's resistance level, SELL. 

Support and Resistance Levels:

I'm burning out here, there is SO much MORE to learn. So If I start jumping around please excuse me. NEVER stop learning. If you just won $100 on XYZ stock day, good for you... the guy next to you just won $500. There's always someone out there BETTER THAN YOU. Can you go to sleep knowing that some guy somewhere is busting his ass off to make something of his life? I sure as hell can't some nights. It's fucking scary.

Learn about different trading platforms and what they offer.

I started off with OptionsXpress (very beginner friendly) HIGHER COMISSIONS COSTS

http://www.optionsxpress.com/ 

I now trade with OptionsHouse less commission (less beginner friendly)

https://www.optionshouse.com/ 

You can try other trading platforms, I believe there are platforms that are REAL CHEAP but they have higher expectations.  

Have your go-to websites for stocks. Websites you check to either look at market sentiment, what people are saying, analyze charts, look at RSI levels, make a decision upon whether to sell or buy a stock. 

This is a small portion of my sites:

http://finviz.com/

http://www.stockta.com/

http://stocktwits.com/

http://eoddata.com/symbols.aspx 

http://www.marketwatch.com/

THERE IS MUCH MORE to say upon the topic. RESEARCH LEARN AND ASK QUESTIONS! If you have any questions feel free to ask! Most importantly NEVER stop learning. NEVER stop trying to be better. Just think about the moment you get comfortable, some guy is going to come around and show you how it's done. Don't get cocky! Any questions post them below!!

Edit: Read through the comments, you can learn a lot from reading other peoples experiences. Some great tips and advice from other members. 

@AtCoyou made a great point: You have to constantly re-evaluate the position of the stock/s you're holding. It's all supply and demand. Prices rise when there's more demand than there is supply. Prices drop when there's more supply than there is demand! 

""I would actually potentially change it to if it has declined 20%, you need to re-evaluate. If you aren't willing to buy more at that point, then ya, you probably want to sell some. Or even if you can say, ""if it goes down 10% more I will buy more"", I think you are ok to hold... the key is you have to look at why it is going down.""

Edit: I've added some books which I have either read or have been recommended  to read regarding the stock market.

The Little Book That Still Beats The Market

The Intelligent Investor

A Beginners Guide To Investing

ENERGY - 11% of portfolio (SUNE 11%)

FINANCE - 6% of portfolio (BAC 6%)

MANUFACTURING - 10% of portfolio (GE 10%)

FOODSERVICE - 34% of portfolio (SHAK 34%)

MISC HIGH RISK SMALL CAPS - 3.5% of portfolio

This stock has grown almost 30 points in less than a month. Now I understand growth is good, but TOO MUCH growth in such small amount of time is not so good. That's a 44% amount of growth in a matter of weeks. The RSI levels are at 76.95 that's 6.95 points ABOVE the OVERBOUGHT threshold. SHAK seems to have alot of Hype in the news right now. Whenever you're trading stocks like these, take into consideration Market Sentiment. If alot of people (including your mom and grandma) start riding the ""train"" you're on... it might be time to get off. REMEMBER Mr. Market, corrects, ALWAYS. Mr.Market has no feelings.

15-05-22,36wwfx,$X - the unlikely yolo,"So there I am, sitting in front of my computer scrolling through various tickers charts looking for something to yolo in. I'm hot off a nice overnight 200% yolo on TSL earnings calls and looking to throw some of those mad gainz down the yolo drain. Nothing catches my eye and I have to leave for work shortly, when behold! An idea pops into my mind. X, us steel is a company I keep somewhere in the back of my watchlist but never really play with. I pop up the daily chart and see a beautiful channel at the exact right buying opportunity. So without further ado because the time for work was edging closer, and literally no other analysis, I throw in an order for June $25 calls. I get filled at 0.58 and head on my way to the office. 

Later on that day during a lull at work, I happen to scroll through my stock app. X catches my eye as it is now a much different color than this morning. A beautiful green has erupted from a sea of red. Some anti dumping or other fundamental bullshit thing comes out and gives the whole steel industry wings! My calls are now trading for almost double what they were this morning! Excellent! I think to myself. Now do I do what any sane person would do and sell out a 100% gain in a few hours? Hahaha, I wouldn't be telling the story here if I did. You see, I am a follower of wallstreetbets, a true yolo spirit.

15-05-22,36wxk0,"Digital BTC - potentially tapping into $450bn/yr remittances market, their fin-tech products utilizing the underlying blockchain secure ledger under bitcoin","Interested to know what people think on this - in June they are expected to release the first beta version of AirPocket which will be used for depositing cash in say America, and that cash being available for withdrawal instantaneously at the other end. And no this is not by transferring Bitcoin - they are passed that, and utililzing the underlying secure Blockchain ledger.

At this stage, they seem to have first mover advantage in this space a la AirBNB, Uber, and being the first publically listed blockchain/cryptocurrency company in the world it gives them some credibility.
Recent mention of their new push into remittances space - http://www.afr.com/technology/bitcoin-trader-digital-cc-aims-to-become-the-uber-of-money-transfers-20150504-1mxo0j

**Disclosure - I do currently hold this stock and unless the fundamentals change/it turns out to look like a pump and dump, I am in it for the long. Company currently has a market cap of $40.12M. If they can tap into even 1% of that market, initially that is a $45M/year opportunity**

My crosspost begins here:
So I still follow this stock - I exited around October last year when SP continued to fall and I had expected them to progress business operations from mining to other fintech products sooner. A bit naiive in that respect I think in terms of how long they may have been working on the now-announced products to get them closer to launch-readiness before showing their hand/or giving away their products. And now they are starting to execute their longer-term business strategy (e.g. not just mining bitcoins - considering that is unprofitable at current bitcoin prices regardless) I am back in again. I have gained some trust in the management as to me they are starting to show they are executing their strategy as stated - start off with bitcoin mining to fund future operations. (As of last/this month they had around $2.5m cash at hand or in bitcoins)

I also think tech-funds/banks/early adopters are now starting to see the true attraction of this new technology is not bitcoin as such but the underlying secure ledger of the 'blockchain' (some reading about how this can impact the finance/remittances industry - I find this a good read http://www.economistinsights.com/tec...iddleman/tab/1).

So what have they been doing for the past while.. They've released beta version of 'Mintsy' in collaboration with Cryptsy, one of the largest bitcoin/cryptocurrency exchanges (like the NZX, but for bitcoin, litecoin, all the differenttypes etc). Mintsy allows you to rent mining power to mine bitcoins, host your mining rig for lower power costs than you could find elsewhere, host your mining rig and allow you to rent that out to other users. Not a lot of exciting stuff there really but gets exposure all the same, from the March quarterly announcement - over 30,000 pre-enrollments since late 2014, helped by promotion from Cryptsy to it's 250,000+ registered users.

They have made DigitalX Direct available to institutional investors &amp; large commercial operators, to provide real-time liquidity for bitcoin trading. As the platform provides the liquidity, it is not so much affected by the price of bitcoin but more so by the volume of bitcoin traded, which is still growing thus far.

Now for the interesting products..

**DigitalX Pocket** (may just be called Pocket now? Hard to tell) - smartphone/mobile application that provides instant transfer of funds to anywhere in the world, no need to worry about buying/selling/storing bitcoins - DCC handle all that in the background through their DigitalX Direct liquidity platform.

**AirPocket - instant, low-cost peer-to-peer cash transactions - this is the big one**

**This month DCC announced plans to move into the global remittances market.**
Recommend reading the presentation/announcement from 18th of May http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/2015051...q3tvkplpg5.pdf
This is a BIG market (approx $500bn/yr currently and growing) and DCC thus far are planning to have a beta version of their product AirPocket ready for launch by end of Q2 (hopefully end of June). If they can get this out to the market on schedule they will have first-mover advantage - such as the likes of uber, airbnb etc. This is partly massive due to the peer-to-peer possibilities of international remittances/money transfers (disrupting credit unions, wire transfers etc). This is positioned to be massive in developing nations/rural areas which currently lack reliable money transmitters.
How does it work? I'm just going to copy paste from the announcement here because i'm lazy

**AirPocket Agents (“AirAgents”)** are vetted and have a funded AirPocket account. The Sender locates an AirAgent through the application’s mapping interface and approaches them with the cash they intend to send. The AirAgent accepts the cash and through their account with AirPocket sends the equivalent amount through the application. The transaction is recorded on the Blockchain ledger, providing secure, incorruptible, persistent and decentralised storage and verification. This eliminates large overheads associated with the maintenance of the platform and regulatory reporting for digitalBTC.
Once the AirAgent has sent the funds, the sender receives a code (“AirCode”) via an SMS, which they send onto the Recipient. The Recipient then locates an AirAgent in their country and provides them with the AirCode, which credits the AirAgent’s account. The AirAgent then provides the recipient with the cash in their local currency.
The fees to send currency are significantly lower than average fees paid by the Sender using other remittance channels. This is due to the low cost mobile peer-to-peer technology implementation as well as the use of the Blockchain technology to store transaction records. The fees are distributed between digitalBTC and the two AirAgents. **On average the AirPocket fees are around half that of existing providers such as WesternUnion, MoneyGram, WellsFargo. Compliant with Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Dept of U.S Treasury, adheres to Anti-Money Laundering standards.** So no laundering cartel money in and out of the states. By utilizing the blockchain as underlying ledger, **these international transfers can be processed instantly, 24 hours a day.**

**Potential warning sign - Capital raise last week** - this came as a surprise to me. while I was expecting they had enough cash on hand to continue funding development/operations until the end of 2015 (my guesstimate based on previous newsflow), they did a CR this week - went into TH at closing price of 0.285, were seeking $3m - they raised 3.5m at 0.22 adding 15.9m shares to the register (and had one us tech-fund bid for the whole $3m placement which was not accepted by DCC). Since then SP has held up above the CR price which imo looks to position them well for SP increase over the next month as beta version of AirPocket release date nears. Next week or two will tell - according to the chartists on HC it is in a rising channel, I don't follow the TI too much. **I could also be very wrong and the recent SP increase could be a huge pump &amp; dump effort on hotcopper - not that uncommon from my lurking on these forums, DYOR!**

**Additional credit to their proposal/business strategy - MoU/agreement signed with partners to form a JV to facilitate distribution of AirPocket in Latin America &amp; Caribbean (to START with)**
http://digitalbtc.com/wp-content/upl...-Caribbean.pdf
See page 20/21 on the AirPocket investor presentation pdf on asx.com link above - **also listed under Pre-launch - Establish further distribution partnerships in additional regions.** So I am hoping we will see news flow by the end of June of additional JVC's. Page 21 plans to **expand it to India &amp; rest of Asia eventually which could be massive.**

I think the success of AirPocket is going to really rest on consumer uptake/trust in the system, and establishment of registered **AirPocket Agents** being available in enough locations (i'm thinking they will need to be, say, everywhere - multiple AirAgents in every city in the target markets, with good PR campaigns/strategies associated with each of those cities).

Still **very speculative now**, but for me this has de-risked somewhat/enough for me to get back in, with I think some potential ",0

15-05-22,36upio,Keep Bitcoin or invest in rentals?,"Hello all, 
   I'm hoping to solicit some good advice here on a fairly unorthodox situation. I've set up this throw away because I'm a fairly private conscience person. I'm currently living in a small European capital for the past few years. I mined Bitcoin back in 2010 and still have around 600, I've watched the price go up and the price go down, generally I consider it a interesting experiment I've been able to participate in. 
   Lately I've been wondering if I should diversify some of the value by cashing some out (300-400) which *should* yield around  $70-94k at today's prices and investing in some rental properties for income purposes. I'd still maintain 200-300 for the future in case they become the internet monies of the future and spike back up to $1200. These are all originally mined bitcoins so there was never an initial investment. Any advice would **REALLY** be appreciated!

15-05-22,36upmf,Passive Income Series – Forex Trading – A New Investment Option,"Diversify your portfolio. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. How many times have you heard these statements? While these statements can apply to more to just finances, the chances are that you understand that it is a bad idea to invest all your cash in one stock, or put all your money into the same property - but have you really thought about a long term strategy?
Current bank interest rates can only be described as shocking. I read an article at work today that discussed how an Aberdeen Assets fund manager has stated that the safest place for savers to put their money is in shares. While this might seem like an outrageous statement to most, he makes a good point; investing money in a savings account is a pretty bad idea. Given the current rates of inflation versus the interest rates… you are guaranteed to lose money.

What is Forex Trading?
Forex Trading is something we have all probably heard about at some point – perhaps through an advert in the Financial Times or a money magazine of some sort; but do you actually know what it means? Forex trading is the trading of foreign currency (hence the name foreign exchange). Essentially, you buy one currency with another – the idea being using the fluctuating currency conversion rates to your advantage.

Success Story – The Accidental Pay Day
I have a great personal example of how you can make some serious money on the Forex markets. My uncle and his family live in the US after he emigrated over 20 years ago. After leaving the UK, he sold his property and left a large sum of money in a UK bank account. He owns a project management type business and a few years back had to transfer a large sum of money as collateral for an insurance bond – essentially he had to use the nest egg as a guarantee against the insurance policy for a job. He transferred the money from GBP (British Pounds Sterling) to USD (US Dollar) at a rate of approximately $2 for every £1. £80,000 of savings became equivalent to $160,000.
Now he kept this money in the bond to guarantee the insurance for about nine months and transferred the cash back to his UK account shortly after. He thought nothing of this for about a year, until he received his annual interest statement for the UK bank account. Can you imagine the shock (and delight) upon finding out that £80,000 was now over £100,000!? Now I can assure you that the bank didn’t decide to pay him 25% interest, but instead the foreign exchange markets had changed significantly: £1 to $2 had become £1 to $1.50. A case of trading the money at the right time – Had it been the other way around, he would have made a significant loss!
 
Who is Forex Trading For?
The simple answer is everyone! Anyone is able to trade in foreign exchange, but those who have interests and investments in multiple countries had a slight advantage as they can trade between bank accounts. For example, if I have investments in the US (or at least in dollars) and in the UK, I could benefit from having assets in both currencies and move funds when the markets are advantageous to your positions, but there can be significant fees associated with this technique. Others will use Forex trading platforms to convert money between different currencies with the intent purely to make money – i.e. there is no practical reason (like to invest in a property) for converting from one currency to the other.
 
Like anything else, Forex Trading has a level of risk associated with it. There are many resources online where you can learn about the principles of Forex and trading within the market. I highly recommend that you do some reading and research before jumping in – You can lose money as well as gain through trading currencies. That said, if you are totally risk adverse, maybe the low-interest savings accounts are a better option. You have to be prepared to lose some (if not all) of your investment or play. Similar to the stocks and shares, some currencies are more stable than others – politically unstable currencies are far more likely to fluctuate than the US dollar.

So I added a Vanguard brokerage account to my IRA, but I'm confused. Now my account page lists my Roth IRA, with my target retirement fund below that. But now it has a money market fund as well. Further down the page, it shows my Roth IRA brokerage account, currently empty, shown as a ""sweep account"".

I'm thoroughly confused.. I think. My understanding is that the money market account is basically an account to move money into, which I can then buy stocks with? But, any money I move into my money market account will count as part of my IRA contributions. And then any stocks I buy with that will also be in my IRA. Correct?

And in terms of the sweep account, that just means any dividends I earn or cash I receive from selling stocks will be ""swept"" into my money market account, still within my IRA.

15-05-23,36xv2y,TPIV: Seriously - give it a reason to explode. Any positive news whatsoever and it will go to a dollar.,"I've been in on this stock since 0.28. I sold at .35 and bought back in at .33.

It's now at .40.

None of that matters. What matters is that two weeks ago it was at .16. It has increased its share price by 150%. I know what you're thinking: ""Wow. For it to rise 150% in two weeks, they must have had some great news out that caused it to do that.""

Here's the thing: There hasn't been a goddamned thing out that would cause such a gain. They have a conference coming up in which they'll release some Q1 data. Big fucking deal.

So, there has to be a reason that this stock is propelling itself forward. In fact, there are likely a couple reasons:

1. Insanely low float. Out of 32 million shares, only 5 million shares became available to non-institutional investors. And between 5-14 million are actually traded. If news comes out, this stock will spike up.

2. This guy owns stock and warrants in the company: [Read about Kenneth Dart.](http://caps.fool.com/Blogs/who-is-kenneth-b-dart-and-why/388891)

3. They have a partnership with Mayo Clinic (Read: Best hospital in the world that kings and dictators go to when they want a checkup) to run their studies on testing a cure for the reoccurance of breast cancer. (A better cause than trading oil stocks)

4. Hype. Lots and lots of hype.

So, here's the deal. At 22 cents, it was undervalued. At 40 cents, it's undervalued. And if it's doubled its price with literally no news of merit coming out, imagine what will happen when actual news comes out on this?

Here are some potential news topics that will serve as a catalyst to push this toward, if not over a dollar.

1. At the conference in a week, they report positive Phase 1 data.

2. Kenneth Dart increases his stake in the company. (Potentially could cause another PTBI scenario when Soros increased his position in the company. As in... 300 percent over two days)

3. FDA approval for orphan status of their immunotherapy treatment (60-90 days away)

---------------

tl;dr - Steady gains that aren't being erased. Low float, and a lot of love for this stock. You've seen the biotech explosions over the past couple of weeks. When this girl opens her legs (And she will.) you'll be glad that you already had your erect dick waiting at the base of her supple vagina. Do your research on it over the long holiday. It's worth your time.

15-05-22,36vke3,How to determine when a Pump will occur,"I bought into IGRW last week with when news of a new CEO happened. The stock didn't really go anywhere.

So what signs do you look for before a Pump happens. 

I could sell now and break even, but I'm not in for alot of money. I'm willing to take the risk and go long on this stock if I need to. Even though that breaks away from my system. 

That brings up another question. Most people use a system to minimize risk. But do you ever deviate from that with Hunches or gut feelings based on some other information about a company, such as a product or distribution deal? Guess that really should be another topic entirely.",2

15-05-23,36ynz6,10k USD to invest this week,"Hello all, I've got 10K USD to invest, wanting to invest into an index fund that will make me around 5-8% per anum - what do people recommend? While I've bought individual stocks before, when I lived in the UK, and studied modern portofolio theory academically (e.g. Ben Bernanke CAPM, SML, sharpe), I am after some practical advice and wisdom from those with experience. There are many financial products I probably wouldn't understand or have heard of yet, and as I haven't chosen a career in finance, I believe a major source to continue my finacial education is through discussions with experienced people. 

So I have 10K USD which I want to put somewhere useful. I would say my risk appetite is higher than most (OK, subjectively from my point of view, so maybe this isn't too helpful - is there a way to quantify this?).  Would you agree it's best if I give you my targets (above) and calculate the level of risk I need to accept to meet it. I currently have a 401k plan with all my contributions in a Blackrock LifePath 2050 Fund L. I've been contributing for 7 months. I'm not sure on the fund's risk (and it would be nice for someone knows what it is), but from a quick look the YTD returns for the few years hasn't been below 5%. 

Anyway, I don't want to lock all my money in a 401k - I want access to money (especially as I'll probably be putting down for a house in the next few years), and I want my money to grow. I thought about someVanguard Large Caps, Small Cpas and REITs, maybe even Blackrock LifePath again (can I get it outside of a 401k - noob question there). Should I consider ETFs, and if so why. 

Please don't dismiss me for any neophyte statements I made. I know I don't know best. I'm really trying to avoid the classic pitfalls. I just want good advice - no egos, hubris or sanctimonious. I don't treat investments as a get rich quick scheme or the akin.

EDIT: People asked for time horizon - is this important simply because of tax reasons (locking money into an IRA &amp; 401k), or are there other common financial products I'm missing out on if I don't lock my money away and commit long term. Teach me. I want my money to better inflation and plow back any profits into purchasing new equity to grow the portfolio. I currently want access to my money, if not for anything else, just because I'm starting out and it feels 'safer' until I have more confidence. I want to look at this first 10K as the start of a portfolio that will last me a lifetime. Please do let me know if any of this sounds foolish.",40

15-05-23,370w0m,Help with Mexico Real Estate (La Paz) and dealing with possibly corrupt lawyers/govt,"Before I begin, I want to preface by saying the hindsight is 20/20, and my father would have never made the investment had he known what he was getting in to. At the time I was too young to understand, and now that I'm older I want to see if the situation can be salvaged.

Around 2009/2010 my father, along with a group of other investors, purchased about $1m worth of undeveloped land in La Paz. My father contributed to over 50% of the purchase price at the time. Unfortunately, this was the first time he had ever purchased real estate other than the U.S. and India, so he had no clue what he was getting in to.

The deal was made and money exchanged hands. Fast forward a couple of months later, a local family claims that THEY have the original title of the land, and it was later discovered that they may have paid off some officials to essentially forge the documents. My father and the investors hired a local lawyer, who turned out to be corrupt. They then found another lawyer around 2013, and the legal battle has been waging since then. This second lawyer isn't local, so she has been working with a lawyer local to the area. This has caused rifts in the communication, because currently my father gets his information from the guy who originally brought the deal to the table (lets call him J), who is communicating with the second lawyer we hired, who is meeting with the lawyer in La Paz. 

Obviously, the situation is extremely messy. The investment group is no longer paying the lawyers, as the process has now drawn out over 5 years and seems bleak. Instead, J will receive 10% of the land should the case be won, in exchange for paying the lawyers. 

What I want to do is clean up the levels of communication, gather all the legal documents (which are all in spanish, mind you), and reopen a consistent dialogue with the lawyers themselves to find out what is going on. 

I know, the investors (including my dad) blindly put their money somewhere unsafe, and are paying the price. I just want to see if anything can be salvaged, because J seems to think so, as well as the lawyers (who I don't know can be trusted). 

If by chance there is anyone who has dealt with a situation in another country like this before, can you offer any advice? I offered to handle all communication with J from now on for my dad, because he has been very hands-off for the past couple of years. I think his hands-off attitude and lack of questioning the progress has only facilitated nothing being done (on top of the fact that he recently purchased and is running a new business). 

I am still getting information from my dad, and he will be emailing me all the legal documentation so I can read over it and see what we're working with.

I understand in this scenario it is really easy to criticize and ridicule my dad and the other investors, but I want to attempt to help him get that money back. If anybody has any sort of advice, it would be very, very much appreciated. I will respond to anyone who has advice.

Thank you.",6

15-05-23,370xya,ETF vs Mutual fund same expense ratio,"Planning on opening a taxable brokerage account with Vanguard to start investing in a Total Stock Index. 

There are two options: the ETF (VTI) or the admiral share mutual fund (VTSAX). Both have expense ratios of 0.05% and there are no transaction fees for the ETF.

I am looking for the most tax efficient choice. I am not interested in trading in the middle of the day since I'll be long term investing. I've heard I'll need to worry about the bid/ask spread if I choose the ETF, is this just another cost associated with the ETF, maybe just a few pennies?

I believe both give out dividends so their growth won't be 100% long term capital gains (at 0% for my tax bracket).

""Most Vanguard ETFs have no tax advantage over the corresponding Vanguard index funds, because in most cases the ETF is a share class of the index fund and thus the mutual fund shares the tax benefits of the ETF.""

Is there a reason to choose one or the other?",1

15-05-23,36ziko,Thoughts from the inside,"Hey all, I'm an analyst on a client facing desk at a bulge bracket IB, here's a quick rundown of my thoughts on this week. If there's interest I'll put another one up next week and if you have any questions hit me up in the comments and I'll try to give you an intelligible answer, or I'll just make one up. Enjoy!

US investors continue to find themselves in a difficult position this week with the current outlook placing them firmly on the horns of dilemma. On one hand, more positive housing data and inflation data at expectations this week is reinforcing the theme of a Q2 resurgence while simultaneously lining up the Fed for 2015 rate hike. Wednesday’s FOMC minutes did little to clear up the confusion with the Fed continuing to wait on more data but essentially taking a June hike off the table due to ‘strong economic headwinds’. 

The S&amp;P thus recorded a meek 3pt gain to close at 2,127 on low volumes and in a relatively tight trading band which says to me that firstly, the desks were already focused on the long weekend and secondly, no one is really sure what to do next. In FX, the better economic backdrop is helping the USD to find its legs as the market increasingly discounts the weaker Q1 data with the EUR/USD cross losing 4c (US dollars now more valuable) in a quick move downwards.

Elsewhere in the world, rates volatility in the Eurozone has subsided (Bill Gross’ now infamous Bund short trade – which he talked but didn’t actually do) as the ECB announced it would front-load QE purchases to support the market. Greece continues to be a concern as the next IMF payment data approaches in early June. Chinese growth is looking increasingly shaky with investment and industrial indicators all down making it more likely the PBoC will ease again in the coming months.",12

**Timeline:**

**9 October, 2007:** The all-time high set by the mid-2000s bull market. A full year before the crash, talk of bubbles and financial crises were already ongoing.

**19 September, 2008:** The market's [last good rally](http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/19/markets/markets_newyork2/) before things turned. The S&amp;P 500 had already dropped 20% over the previous year. Lehman Brothers went bankrupt [4 days earlier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman_Brothers). Henry Paulson says about the proposed bailouts [""If this doesn't pass, then heaven help us all.""](http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/09/19/this-day-in-crisis-history-sept-19-2008/)

**29 September 2008:** The Dow drops 778 points, [its biggest loss ever](http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/29/markets/markets_newyork/), as the House rejects the bailout plan.

**20 November 2008:** The market [drops down to 1997 levels](http://money.cnn.com/2008/11/20/markets/markets_newyork/), erasing the previous decade of economic gains. The recession is on, the only debate being how long it will last.

**9 March 2009:** [Bottom](http://money.cnn.com/2009/03/09/markets/markets_newyork/). The S&amp;P 500 has since gone up 214%. ([corrected](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/373yfk/how_25_stocks_and_the_market_fared_before_during/crjlg43))

**23 April 2010**: The first recovery pulls near pre-crash levels. It proves short-lived though as the market slumps 15% during the summer.

**22 December 2010:** The second recovery surpasses the pre-crash levels. It would slump again in 2011, before ultimately pulling through.

**28 March 2013**: The market [finally eclipses](http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/28/investing/stocks-markets/) the high it set in 2007.

**22 May 2015:** The previous close.

**Analysis:**

Finance was at the heart of the 2008 crash, with companies losing 80+% of their values. Some, like GE, GS and WFC have recovered, while others like BAC are nowhere close. Stalwarts like BRK, PG, MSFT, NKE, KO and JNJ, were barely touched in the early parts of the crash, but even they were pulled down as it became clear a recession was underway. It's amazing to see even the unrelated DIS and AAPL shed over half their value - there were very few places to turn to for relief. Volatile names like AMZN suffered mightily during the drop, crashing even harder than the general market, but this volatility may have also contributed to their spectacular recoveries. Less volatile names like VZ and XOM neither dipped as deep nor climbed as high. MCD and WMT were notably the only Dow Jones components to post net gains in 2008.

The 2008 crisis didn't exactly sneak up on the market. The causes were being shouted out for months and the uncertainty caused the market to slump a full year before the crash. A well-diversified investor could've got out with 70-80% of their portfolio even if they got in at the 2007 high and got out after the first crash. It wasn't until it became clear the crisis would push the economy into a recession that the rest of the market got dragged down, and bottom didn't come until nearly 6 months after the initial crash.",135

https://twitter.com/SMCEUSA/status/601829763859230720

$SMCE Potential buyout target &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; By INgrooves, especially when taking into consideration their most recent venture in acquiring Fontana in 2012 which SMCE's Kurt Heidolph was an integral part of Fontana....

Earlier this year, and throughout- plus their website- SMCE told us/telling us that 

• They are pursuing a new business plan 
• Strive to be a One Stop Shop for artist
• Distribution Distribution ""Pipeline""
• Targeting India and Latin America which is ""untapped"" for digital distribution. 
• Added Russ Regan (a legend) to their advisory board. 

NOTE: there is significant similarities between $SMCE and Fontana (which INgrooves bought out) as it appears the same business model Fontana had is what SMC is doing, also former management from Fontana is now a part of SMCE, see below 

First we have the connection from the filings in place alongside a material contract with INgrooves already in place 

As the issuer moves into Quarter 2 of 2015 management plans to expand its operations into ownership and control of certain digital content distribution outlets for both music and film. Management believes that as the entertainment industry trends towards more and more on-line distribution of content, the real revenue growth is in ownership of on-line content distribution “pipes.” If the future of the entertainment industry is in streaming content, I want our company to direct those streams rather than have to negotiate with companies to stream our content.The Company is currently negotiating the acquisition of a music distribution company 

Prior to working with SMC, Mr. Heidolph managed business analysis and reporting for Fontana Distribution, Universal Music Group Distribution’s independent label division, from 2008-2011. During this time he automated nearly every reporting process and increased the division’s financial efficiency by 100%-150%. Additionally, he created forecasting models that could accurately predict physical and digital sales which had not been possible before. 


www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/retail/1098611/ingrooves-to-purchase-fontana 


INgrooves, the digital aggregator launched in 2002, has purchased Fontana, the indie distribution company owned by Universal Music Group, the company announced today. 

The deal gives the digital distributor a full array of services to offer to indie labels and at the same time provide capital to build up Fontana's capabilities in marketing music to brick-and-mortar merchants. 

INgrooves itself already has a relationship with Universal Music Group, which bought 51% of the company in 2008, sources say. That stake was reduced to about 40% when Shamrock Capital, a unit of Shamrock Holdings, bought a majority interest in INgrooves in 2010. With the latest deal, Universal's stake in the company will be reduced to about 15%-20%. 

In addition, sources say Shamrock is paying UMG about $5 million to $10 million for Fontana, which has annual sales of about $90 million and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of about $5 million to $7 million, Billboard.biz estimates. 

INgrooves Makes Updates to Its Client Console 

While Fontana's EBITDA would normally value that company at about $25 million -- based on the four-times multiple that distribution assets have traded for in the past -- total valuation for the deal is difficult to estimate because even though UMG's stake in INgrooves is being reduced, it now owns a portion of a larger company. 

Billboard.biz estimates INgrooves' revenue at about $45 million, which means the company will now have revenues of about $135 million, making it the fourth-largest U.S. indie distributor behind RED, Alternative Distribution Alliance, and eOne Distribution. 

Backbeat: Fontana Hosts Event for NYC Labels 

Moreover, UMG benefits by being affiliated with an indie distributor that plans to grow with the backing of the deep-pocketed Shamrock Capital. A bigger, complementary INgrooves/Fontana operation with a revitalized game plan could benefit by the changing indie distribution landscape, with the Warner Music Group's ADA further integrated into WEA, and with the fate of Caroline/EMI Label Services Group up in the air due to its pending absorption into UMG. 

While UMG is required to unload music assets in order to help finance its acquisition of EMI's recorded-music division, which is pending regulatory approval, sources say the deal for Fontana was in the works months before the major even came up for sale. 

Universal Music Group Distribution provides some shared services with Fontana, and sources say some of those services will continue, while other backroom/office functions will be assumed by INgrooves. On the flip side, INgrooves plays a role in the digital pipeline for UMG, helping it to ready and deliver music to digital service providers. 

""Through this acquisition, we are now able to offer the independent music community a fully integrated physical and digital distribution marketing solution in North America,"" INgrooves CEO and found Robb McDaniels said in a statement. 

In the announcement, the company said the deal will allow for the expansion of the Label &amp; Artist Services group. This unit, which currently provides product management, online marketing &amp; PR coordination, sync licensing, brand partnership marketing, sponsorships and advertising for the respective companies, will be a core focus of expansion in the coming months. The company said the value-added services will be available to INgrooves Fontana clients on a per project basis. 

McDaniels also said the deal will provide the company's ""client base with a larger sales force, more marketing resources and a one-stop global retail network that maximizes opportunities in this dynamic, challenging environment."" 

As part of the deal, Fontana president Ron Spaulding, who plays a key A&amp;R role in bringing labels to Fontana, will stay with the company as president and run it, sources say, while Dave Zierler, recently promoted to president of INgrooves, will run that side of the company, with both reporting to McDaniels. 


Why would INgrooves want to buy SMCE? Well as you can see they bought Fontana and they are executing the same business model. 



INgrooves Music Group is comprised of 3 service divisions: Distribution Services, Artist Services (“INresidence”), and Rights Services. All three divisions work in alignment to provide each of our partners with a solid customized solution that meets their business needs.

15-05-24,3746u7,What is the case for buy-and-hold really?,"My sense is that many people here have a knee-jerk, negative reaction towards market timing. I've tried to distill the arguments against market timing below. Which ones do people find most compelling, did I misrepresent any of these, and what arguments have I missed?

Also most of these are arguments *against* market timing. So is buy-and-hold the default position since the alternative (timing) is so bad? What are the positive arguments for buy-and-hold? 



(1) Individual investors get emotional, chase past performance, panic and as a result make dumb decisions and underperform the market as per the often cited Dalbar survey etc. So buy-and-hold is a bit like a pair of training wheels on your bike. They might keep you from going very fast, but at least you won't fall and hurt yourself too badly. The evidence, of course, doesn't say that some people can't time successfully, just that most can't.

(2) Market timing involves incurring transactions costs. I think this one is non-controversial. Although for funds in an IRA or 401(k) account, timing say the S&amp;P via ETFs is very low cost now so this argument doesn't apply nearly as strongly as it did in the prehistoric Burton Malkiel / John Bogle hey days.

(3) It is impossible to time the market since markets are very close to being efficient. This point is a bit subtle and depends on how you interpret being able to ""time the market"" and ""efficient"". Most finance researchers (from Eugene Fama on the one side to Robert Shiller on the other) would now agree that aggregate stock market returns are indeed ""predictable"", but differ on whether this predictability implies ""abnormal"" returns beyond compensation for bearing risk. (E.g. during the financial crisis, stock prices were low and expected returns were high because people were very scared and you had to compensate them for holding stocks with the promise of higher than usual returns. So in this view, stock returns were predictable, but this doesn't necessarily imply any inefficiencies.)

(4) Finally the laziest argument of all against market timing imo. Many people simply trot out a quotation from their favorite guru (Buffet, Bogle, Malkiel) without unpacking the argument behind it. 

(Btw Warren Buffet may recommend holding the S&amp;P for your retirement portfolio and say he holds stocks forever and that financial derivatives are evil, but he was selling put options on global stocks - S&amp;P, Eurostoxx, FTSE, Nikkei - during 2004-2008. If that's not market timing, I don't know what is.)

http://imgur.com/LaYKiid

HOW I TURNED $15,000 into $22,000 in 2 months (46.67% return)

1. OPEN A MARGIN ACCOUNT, you can trade 3 times on a rolling 5 day basis (2k+ is needed). To have unlimited trades one needs 25k+ in their margin account (Pattern day trader). 

2. AROUND 10k+ STARTUP MONEY is needed (I opened and closed a successful online business this year - which I used the proceeds to invest). If you are a baller, this amount can be an essential cash cow. The cash cow needs at least 10k+ and then if nurtured, it will crap out Ben Franklins and produce liquid gold from its utters. 

3. DO NOT INVEST in any companies owned by humans. This is a weird statement, but hypothetically the CEO could go crazy and burn his business to the ground. Oil is a NON-renewable resource that is constantly being exhausted via world growth (More demand). Oil is #1 for energy and it will always be. If anyone tells you that they can produce fuel from electricity, corn, sugar cane, or from the sun politely tell them to dream on.

4. DO INVEST in only crude oil stocks! I prefer UWTI and DWTI. UWTI is 3x leverage that follows the price of crude oil. DWTI is 3x leverage that is the inverse of crude oil (Oil goes up DWTI goes down, vice versa). Average volatility is around 3-13% per day! 

5. REFUSE DEFEAT! Since oil is really low and you purchase UWTI and the price of oil drops, hold it until you can sell the stock for a profit! If Rocky Balboa did not get up when he was punched down he wouldn't have been a revered boxer. 

6. BUY LOW SELL HIGH, seeing oil is very volatile don't worry if you are down 10%, just hope for a rally. Also think mentally, do you think oil will ever be less then 2$/g? Personally I do not. Do you think oil will ever be more then 4$/g? Personally, i believe its just a matter of time.  

7. I started investing with my only experience being in my high school economics. DO NOT trust your gut feeling, hard data, news reports, and ""experts""; you have to LISTEN TO YOUR HEART to survive day trading. 

WTI CRUDE OIL LIVE STREAMING CHART I USE: http://www.investing.com/commodities/crude-oil

Follow this guide step by step and make it rain dollar bills from 4 a.m. to 8 p.m. I use e-trade which is nice because i get 2 months free commission, but you can only trade from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Other online brokerages offer 4am-8pm trading times which is ideal because the high or low could happen during 4am-7am and you could completely miss it!

There are a few remedies suggested by betterment:

1. Move the iras over to betterment, their algorithms are smart enough to avoid a wash sale across accounts
2. Pick a new actively managed portfolio. In all honesty I'm not enamored with any actively managed funds and wouldn't know where to start.
3. Buy a target fund. Fidelity freedom funds suck and vanguard target funds cost $75 to buy. I once had a fido rep claim he might be able to get that waived but I dunno..

More of, what if I just dump my investments into large cap companies I know will do well? But only pick 2 or 3. 

I know companies like Apple, Starbucks, and Google will do well over then next 3 to 4 years, why mess with anything else if I don't have the funds to get into IPO's or preferred shares, nor the expertise as of yet to get into futures/options?

My current strategy is to save double the match on my 401k (8%, matching 4%), my company also offers a stock purchase plan, to which i max out at 5%, and of course maxing out a Roth IRA. 

This high risk would be for anything after I max out the IRA, but maybe it would work out well for the IRA.. especially if I trade around a position on a monthly/quarterly based on earnings rumors etc.

I just graduated college and plan to get a real job, Ill keep the same savings concepts, but obviously make a lot more. I plan to keep my expenses (very very low) for a few years to really save up a lot.. preferably over 20k in the next few years and really get into options. Im absorbing Hull's 9th edition in preparation, and in time some paper trading. 

So thoughts on my plan? Pedantic responses are not needed.

15-05-25,3787vs,"Why hiring a broker may not be a good idea, especially the ""successful"" ones.","Former Broker/FA/Institutional Consultant here:

I've worked on Wall Street or probably a better word, ""Main Street"" my entire professional career (38, from age 22, not in NYC).  

I've worked at discount brokerages, insurance companies, full service, regional and independent as well as owned and operated my own advisory practice as RIA under a clearing arrangement.  I've worked in options trading, derivatives trading, operations, time and sales, clearing, institutional bond trading, executive roles in sales and sales management and operations management and at a director role before going into sales running a practice at full service, then regional, then independent.  

A lot of people will try to discredit what I am about to say, say I was unhappy and unsuccessful (Managed 130 million) but that's simply not the case.  Just feeling like I need to let a few people know about what goes on behind the scenes in one particular area in describing the advice you get on the Full Service/Regional side isn't probably the best advice and it's not the FAs fault, lack of training, incompetence or products.  It's a unknown conflict of interest that exists that most of the clients have no clue is going on and is rarely talked about or never talked about outside of industry publications.  This problem is why clients are paying 2-3% and more annually on their assets.  Here goes...

When one becomes an FA they typically go through all kinds of testing, interviews, etc., to become a financial advisor selling investment or other financial products.  The testing and interviewing that goes on isn't about intelligence, comprehension or knowledge or capacity to retain such financial knowledge.  It's simply-can you work a calculator and can you sell.  That's it.  It's all about the ability to sell.  

Then once hired you go through all the training, etc. To become a financial advisor.  Mainly just compliance stuff, series 7, 65 and state 66 or 63 whatever is required in the state in which is the classic brokers licensing.  You have to have a moderately clean record so fingerprinting and background checks are in order (typically before being hired obviously). 

Then the training dies off, the real fun starts and you go to work, although most do the following while getting licensed and sometimes before even being hired to see if your going to have a natural market to sell to.  Because it's all about the mighty dollar.  Always.  

You build out tons of lists of potential clients and build 2-4 market niches that your going to go after.  Then you start dialing for dollars, setting appts., and meeting with folks trying to get them to work with you.  Eventually at the end of your career or hight of your success you'll only have 1 or 2 niche groups you work with, which is normal.  I worked with all types and in the end worked with organizations and pension plans (Union).

You then gather statements, put the info into software and voila your software gives you a plan of which you work with sales mgmt in meshing with their current situation.  This is where the wheat is separated from the shaft so to speak (outside of actually getting in front of people) and you try to show the client how your solutions meet their needs and then talk them into doing it.  Pretty simple.  The best advisors are excellent at this stage.  Ok, so let's fast forward.  

Let's say you got through all that and now your doing good, you've been in the biz for a couple years.  Let's say your top of your class, you've gathered 50mm and your kicking ass.  Your salary is gone that they paid for a short while and your starting to earn commissions and you've made it (about 5% of all who walk in the door).  Your a baller working on the street, in your late 20s or early 30s and you go out and buy a nice car, get married, buy a McMansion, membership at a club, drinks, golf, dinners, etc., etc.  

Then it all catches up to you.  What happened?  You were killing it but, now you need to make more money. You need to get more.  It's not because your greedy it's because your around money all day, TV, computer, clients, execs, guys at CC and your jaded.  You don't realize it but all your external stimuli is saying millions, millions, millions.  You've got to get them.  If not, your a failure.  Plain and simple.  

At about this time the brokerage industry has all this figured out.  Assets are the name if the game and when you have 50-200mm in assets at your basic control everyone wants you to work for them.  But, not just your competition your own broker wants you too.  

So, what happens?  This is where the conflict steps in.  

Your being recruited and after receiving offers and others hearing about them guys talk, assistants talk and your existing firm comes to you and says, hey buddy we love you so much that we will pay you $500k - $2mm to stay here for the next 7 yrs (obviously depends on production) and you start to literally froth at the mouth.  Your about to win the lotto and all your hard work is going to pay off.  Then the competition starts calling an by now your doing 500k in gross sales production (commissions generated for your firm) and the competitor says they'll pay you 200% of your gross.  Or $1,000,000 to come to their firm.  What do you do?  You either decide the headache isn't worth it or you go, regardless your a moron because the numbers are impossible to meet unless you continue to grow at the same clip, adding more clients, more commissions and more, more, more.  It's an extremely hard game to play.  You have to be a robot on steroids.  Some guys can, most can't.  

I've done the math a hundred times and it's next to impossible.  So this signing bonus is rarely what it sounds like, in fact less than 5% of deals are actual cash money deals with no strings attached.

It's really a loan.  Nothing more, nothing less. 

And what happens next is devastating to clients returns, assets and trust.  

So you have impossible bogeys to overcome with your new deal but you figure with all the cash you can buy the clients if you have to, but you don't.  You get a new car, house, etc and redo the past 5-10 years only bigger, better and drop the wife and pickup a hotter much more beautiful 20 something with less miles (actually probably more), but you don't care.  At this point you've turned into a sociopath.  

Then you start twisting, switching and pounding your clients for every nickle, dime and penny to meet those goals.  And when you can't your firm is quick to offer a restructure of your deal (sometimes with more cash), or you get out of your existing crack pot situation when a new deal comes along from a new firm wiping the slate clean.  Or you create a Ponzi and steal, whatever.  

Here is where I start wanting to puke.  

The other day I was reading earnings numbers from a well known firm on the street.  They had great revenue, sales, AR, etc.  Wait... what is AR I asked?  I bet I know.   Accounts Receivable.  Yep.  All those brokerage loans from guys switching firms during the collapse.  The number was in the billions.  For a firm with less that 100k reps.  Holy shit.  That's crazy.  I seriously doubt there is a conflict of interest here.  Lol.  

Crazy huh.  The biggest revenue driver for this firm in the past year had been this AR number even after the run up in markets and fee based revenue.  

Not sales, not interest on cash.  Account receivables from loans to financial advisors at their firm.  

Now.  I ask you this.  The next time you reach out to your broker and listen to their sales pitch are you going to ask how much they have on loan at their firm, how many years are left on the contract and what's in it for them if you sign or are you going to be mesmerized by their bad ass closing skills they've perfected along the way through survival in the brokerage biz realizing if you don't buy, sign or give it a go they'll be robbing peter to pay Paul at the end of the month with their credit cards to keep paying the country club dues?

15-05-25,375863,Buying an investment property and renting your own residence,"When you buy your first property, generally, you buy your primary residence. This means that you can afford to buy a place where you work, which is often hard to do if you live in a high cost of living area and are at the very start of your career, and also that you should be pretty sure that you will spend the next few years in said place, because if real estate prices go down, or simply if you move just a year after you buy, between the closing costs, realtor fees and the cost of moving in, you may lose money.

Another idea would be instead to buy a rental, so you can get the benefits of getting on the property ladder while at the same time keep the flexibility of renting a property fit for your needs.

Why would you opt for a rental?
Well as I said above, the first thing that comes to mind is that your local property market may not be ideal for home ownership if priced are on the rise. The rent vs buy calculations may not lean towards buying in overpriced housing bubbles. But you live there, so you still need a place to stay. What better way to have someone pay your rent while you build up equity on the property they live in?

You may not make enough to buy a place in New York, but already have savings that would represent a hefty deposit in Kansas City. And the rent would bring a better return on your deposit than the 0.1% your cash is bringing right now.

If you are living with a significant other, and not ready to put both names on the deed, it allows you to keep your place together while you start investing on your own.

And if you are just starting your career, you should not get tied to a property when your next job could be 3,000 miles away.

By buying a rental, you could move pretty much anywhere without worrying about having to sell your home before doing so. That is what I did with my UK property. I lived there for less than a year (with roommates) before putting the whole place up for rent and moving to Morocco. Now, I am still a continent away, and on top of that have put six time zones between my property and myself. And you know what? It works out just fine.

My tenants each rent a bedroom on separate contracts, and when one is about to vacate, they interview potential tenants to find the new roommate. I take care of bills and include them in their rent so they don’t have to fight about splitting them equally. The only little bumps on the way are generally about cleaning habits of some of them, so I am thinking about raising the rents and including a weekly cleaner. Other than this, if the washing machine or the heater breaks, I just send a handyman and wire them the money.

So I wouldn’t be worried about having a property two hours drive away, if one ocean away is doable.

What I thought before I left was that the rent I would get from the bedroom I used to occupy, around $1,000, would basically cover my rental needs anywhere in the world. Yes, $1,000 is pretty expensive for a room, but that is under market price when said room is in an affluent suburb of London. I have only had one week vacancy in one of the rooms over the past 5 years.

In Guatemala, $1,000 happens to cover my entire living expenses and the salaries of two staff, because I paid cash for my house, but it would more than cover my rent of a three bed luxury condo in a great neighborhood of Guatemala City. Even in Europe, aside from London, Paris and a few overpriced capitals, I could get a comfy two bedroom and live on my own. And if I felt like going back to Paris for a while, $1,000 would still get me an independent, albeit smaller unit.

I really like that the money from rent can be allocated to my living expenses, just like the time my motorcycle insurance company paid for some advertising on my blogs, enough to cover two years of bike insurance. You get the idea, getting a fixed source of income gives you the freedom of using that same income to cover the same category of expense for your flexible life.

 

Where should you buy a property?
If you have a nomadic lifestyle like I do, the world is pretty much your oyster. And if your career could take you anywhere in the country, buying next to where you live now may not be buying where your next job will be, so once again, you could look at your whole state, or your whole country. Some ideas include

- A college town. Students rarely buy a place during their college years, and you have a constant influx of potential new tenants. I am in a college town and my prices deter the freshmen so usually I get the PhD students or the recent graduates working their first job. They are serious, and often have mum and dad behind, which is extra consolation.

- Your hometown. While you may not live there at the beginning of your career, you may aspire to come back once you settle down and start a family. Plus your parents could keep an eye on the property, send their trusted handyman to do maintenance or chase payments face to face for you. You don’t want to be a burden but it gives you some peace of mind to know there is still a family member nearby if things go sour. You are also able to make an educated decision about each neighborhood without too much research, as you lived there for years.

- The highest yielding market. A quick online search will tell you which markets offer the highest rent in your region of choice.

- The best house you can afford on a high down payment. Things may not always go the way you planned and your property may sit empty for a while, and having low repayments will make life much easier. You could look for a place that is affordable right now, and put a 30-50% deposit on it, so the rent is only a fraction of the repayments. That will also allow you to live on the surplus should you lose your job, to pay off the rest of the mortgage early as well, or to set aside a good chunk of money for future renovations.

- A duplex. When you live a nomadic lifestyle, you often want a base to come home to. Buying a duplex or a triplex allows you to have renters pay most of the housing costs while you still keep a small unit as your own to store your stuff and re-energize when you are tired of traveling. Plus they serve as free house sitters!",1
15-05-25,375898,"Anyone YOLO'ing with Lending Club (LC)?","I was fortunate to get the IPO price of $15 and sold it at $23.50. It ran up to $29 and now down in $17-$19 range. I got in at $18 again and also bought Oct 20 calls. 

Why I like this stock: It had a solid earnings and growth last quarter. Morgan Stanley upgraded it to buy. I think people are concerned about IPO expiration on June, but I think like FB, it will be better for the stock and it will go up. 

Also, increasing interest rate will help this stock as people will look for alternatives to banks to get  low APR loans. Lending Club has competitors, but they are the biggest and most trusted and I think there is big enough market to support multiple competitors. 

I see huge potential with this stock and it is fairly volatile so thought you guys might like it.

15-05-25,37589e,In search of advices.,"Hey /investing/,

I recently invested 1000€ into the stock market.

So far I'm holding four french mutual funds (USA's Shares, Finance Europe, Bonds and Midcap France).

On the other side I bought one share of each : Blackrock, BRK.B and Tesla.

Regarding the mutual funds I've applied the dollar cost averaging strategy with 100€ per month invested in them (25€ for each fund).

I've read on this thread that 1000$ is not enough to invest because you will be eaten by fees. But if I decide to buy and hold for long term, does it applies for me ? I tend to usually buy for 300€ worth of shares every month when I have some extra cash, one at a time.

Is there anything I can change in my investing journey ?

I'm willing to buy Google next, Apple and Disney. What do you recommend for long term investing ?

15-05-26,379q1m,"I've seen a lot of new people in r/stocks and wanted to give an alternative broker (Full disclosure and risk/reward covered in post)","**NOT SHILLING** ~~ Just highlighting that there are ways around large broker fees

I'm sure many people wont want to read the entire thing so here is a synopsis. **You can trade stocks without using USD, instead you would use BTC (Bitcoin) as collateral.**  This is primarily for people who want to learn, while exposing themselves to the risk of investing and avoiding massive traders fees. The Broker you would end up using is a website called 1broker. ( I do not work for them, i am just some one that uses the service, and is noticing posts in this subreddit about fee issues) With 1Broker, **You deposit Bitcoin** ( I'm happy to answer any questions you have on this) **and with the value of the bitcoin you deposit you are able to trade a select number of  stocks, commodities, forex, and Indices.**

***Alright***, ive been a pretty successful day trader for the passed few years, and i notice a lot of people who are just starting, and only have access to low capital. i wanted to let new traders, and veteran traders know of what i currently use and why. 1Broker is a simple service that offers a great way to trade. You deposit X amount of Bitcoin ( for young traders i suggest depositing 10-20$ worth). **AS WITH ANY BROKER YOU CANNOT LOSE MORE MONEY THAN YOU DEPOSIT**. I say this because with your 10-20 dollars ( Or more if you wish) You are able to trade about 11 Stocks. I understand that this pool is small, but they're tech companies and specifically chosen by 1broker because they are volatile. ( The brokerage founder joins a teamspeak with us traders and talks openly about his interface). The website allows for leverage. LEVERAGE is the ability to trade with more money than you have. What this essentially does is magnifies risk and reward.*** UNDERSTAND THIS!*** Using leverage is more risky. Using leverage can however deliver greater returns on lower capital. ( Ex. You Deposit 50$. You use 5x leverage, youre able to trade with 250$ worth of capital, allowing you to buy 5 Shares of Microsoft. Microsoft goes up .50$ while you're long and with your 50 dollar deposit you turned a 1% increase into a 5% increase, and thus a 1% profit into a 5% profit.) LEVERAGE IS RISKY. AGAIN I NEEEED TO HIGHLIGHT THIS. You can also lose 5% that easily. 

When Trading Forex you're able to do the same thing. Except the website allows for leverage up to 200x. Stocks you can trade up to 15x. This is a great way for people with low capital, to get a larger exposure to the markets. 

**PRO'S OF USING THIS**

1. The Fees are maker taker. ( Practically non-existant. If you market but or market sell you pay a fee. If you limit buy or limit sell you dont. The website features a fees page and you're able to get much more detail than i can give. I literally ignore the fees they're that insignificant. One more thing to highlight is the overnight fees. Holding a trade overnight costs a small fraction of a bitcoin. (In most cases less than a dollar)

2. Profits and losses are realized in real time.

3. Deposits take less than an hour ( Bitcoin makes this possible)
4. Withdraws happen literally instantly ( Bitcoin makes this possible)
5. The option to leverage your position

**CONS OF USING THIS WAY OF TRADING**

1. Any profits or losses you incur need to be recorded for when/if you file them on your taxes. Because the website doesn't have to follow all the rules of the US regulatory system, doesn't mean you don't have to. Any gains need to be recorded for capital gains purposes. You can always just print your trade history and give it to your tax guy though.
2. That you need to use Bitcoin. All profits are realized in bitcoin. What this means is that instead of making 1400$, you'll profit 5.9  bitcoin. You'll then have to withdraw that 5.9 Bitcoin and cash it into your bank. Again this is a very quick process. ( Had to highlight that before people rage about the volatility of bitcoin.
3. Having an understanding of Bitcoin will make this much simpler, however I presume this is a con because many of you might need to do a little research.
4. They only offer 12 stocks. ***This isnt really for long term investors*** This is very much for day traders. People like me who just sit and watch stock charts and turn it into whatever profit we can. Aside from the stocks though you have options of trading commodities, indices, or forex
5. **DO NOT DEPOSIT MORE THAN YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE** I really highlight this too. There once was a bitcoin exchange that stole 100 million+ dollars. This has not happened since, But i really emphasize that because these companies transact in Bitcoins instead of any actual currency, they aren't subject to the rules of the US. I often dont keep more than 1-2k in 1broker. When i make profit i withdraw it. I do this to be safe. The company has my personal trust, ive spoken to the CEO and met plenty of other traders who prefer to use their interface, we trust it but i'm covering my bases and making sure that anyone  reading this KNOWS THE RISKS. 


**WEBSITES TO REFERENCE IF THIS IS SOMETHING YOU ARE INTERESTED IN:**

15-05-25,375tvm,Requesting help comparing target date funds,"Right now I have a Roth IRA with $8710 in American Funds 2050 Target Date Retirement Fund (AALTX).  Next week I will add my yearly $5500 to the account.  I am considering moving my money to Vanguard Target Retirement 2055 Fund (VFFVX).  How can I compare these two, as well as any other funds, so that I can make the best decision.  I understand that I am probably getting skewered by fees, but I am having a difficult time finding out exactly what I am paying. 

A few weeks ago, I emailed my American Funds adviser about what he thought of VFFVX for my 403b.  It turns out that it isn't available for my 403b, but he said that while it was a good fund, he was concerned that the fund focuses too much on bonds when it gets closer to its target date and that was dangerous because you don't know if bonds will keep up with the market.   


A little background if it is needed.  I am 24, and am an employee of my state.  I will have a fully funded pension in 23 years if I ""buy"" credits/years, or if I choose not to, it will be fully funded in 28 years.  My Roth IRA is with American Funds because my dad's friend is an adviser for them, and supposedly only works with very wealthy clients, so his reasoning was that I should be lucky to have this guy as an adviser.  But for the life of me, I can't understand why I am paying this man to passively watch my money while charging me for active management.

15-05-26,37aah7,How the Investment Advisor Game is Played,"To end this section on Buy and Hold, let me give you one caveat. When it comes to buy and hold, do not buy to what your Investment Advisor (IA) tells you to buy. I speak of this from personal experience. This is my story.

Back in my college days, I worked at a co-op position at a bank. I was working on the investment advisory side of things where I worked under an Investment Advisor (IA). In essence, we were doing the retail side of investing (working with mom and pop investors). For the sake of anonymity, let’s call my supervisor (the Investment Advisor) Jake (that’s not his real name).

Jake wasn’t just any old Investment Advisor at our bank – he was one of the VP’s (at 40 years old, he’s a hotshot in the bank). And let me tell you – despite all his credentials and certification (President of this organization and that council), his investment advice sucked. If contribution to society were to be a benchmark for his annual salary+bonus, this guy should have been billed. Why? Because Investment Advisors in general don’t care about generating superior investment returns. They care about growing assets under management. That’s because Investment Advisors aren’t paid on performance fees (eg 20% of profits). Investment Advisors make fees from selling expensive financial products (eg mutual funds) and management fees. Thus, there’s a huge conflict of interest. For Investment Advisors, the more money they have under management, the more money Investment Advisors will make. Whether they generate investment returns on those assets or not is inconsequential.

I can list out the terrible advice that my Investment Advisors gave to his “clients” (more like”victims” if you ask me).

Buy stocks in 1999. A year later, market tanks. “Don’t worry about those losses guys! We’re buying and holding!”
Sell stocks in 2001, because the “secular bear market is here”. Needless to say, he was 2 months away from selling at the bottom.
Buy stocks in early 2006. He made a ton of money in 2006 and some money in 2007. 2008 came along, and half of his assets vanished (losses).
Thus, whenever Investment Advisors like Jake lose money, they will wheel in the standard “buy and hold” line. “Oh, don’t worry about that horrific loss. We’re long term investors, so we’ll just hold onto this loss for 10 years until it breaks even”. Over his career, Jake has made practically $0. But he’s a hotshot at the bank because he pulls in the most assets under management (just shy of $100 million).

That is why you should never listen to Investment Advisors when it comes to buy and hold. Buy and hold is an investment strategy. You have to know what you’re doing. What these IA’s are doing is turning buy and hold into hope, which is not an investment strategy. “If we buy and hold this investment for 20 years, let’s hope we make money”. And we all know that hope is the number one cause of disaster for investors. It’s like a gambling mentality.

I have a friend who told me a pretty funny story. One day he and his Investment Advisor were sitting down during their quarterly review. The IA proudly proclaimed “I haven’t lost any money in 10 years!” My friend practically hit the roof because zero profits in 10 years isn’t exactly a happy thing to think of (bonds pay even more).

So why are most trade Investment Advisors so incapable? Because the Investment Advisor game is wrong. In order to be an Investment Advisor, you have to go through a ton of standardized industry tests. But reality is, these tests are absolutely useless! A successful investor is not determined by whether or not he/she can pass a test or not. Investing isn’t a scinece – unlike on a test, there is no absolute right or wrong answer.

15-05-25,377cwf,Question about comex futures ticker on tradingview.com,"When typing in ticker symbols to chart on tradingview.com, typing ""gc"" brings up a list of comex gold futures ranging from 2015-2020.  However, there are two symbols there that I do not understand.  What is ""gc1!"" and ""gc2!""?


Edit: In light of the wisdom shared in the comments by our fellow redditors, I went ahead and tested out whether gc1! and gc2! are generic front month and 2 month contracts.  I plotted out GCM2015/X.  GCM2015 is the gold futures contract expiring in June, 1 month out.  If we plot the ratio where X is gc1!, we should see the ratio chart be equal to 1 since we are about 1 month out right now.  Here is [chart 1](http://imgur.com/1G5x9WT).

If we plot X = gc2!, then we should see the chart hit 1 about a month ago and to vary a little bit right now.  Here is [chart 2](http://imgur.com/qRaFEg3).  The resolution on the y-axis is not great but it should be sufficient for our purpose.

The plots come out as expected.  Thanks to all who contributed!",10

There's a lot of support for MGNA around $1.40 today, which seems like a very good sign considering the overall market. I've been doing a lot of research on MNGA and there is a lot of positive buzz about them. Their product appears solid and I have yet to read a negative review about it. Also they claim to be picking up contracts left and right, getting a deal with the Navy is particularly good news. So there's a lot of good air about them. But wouldn't all this positive news be baked into the price already?

However, when I look at their numbers I'm not so sure. Their Q1 2015 revenue compared to Q4 2014 is only a $39,000 increase, which leaves something to be desired. Looking at their financials from Q4 2014, they have huge operating expenses compared to revenue. That's what concerns me. Will the continued marketing and distribution of their product eventually offset their high operating expense, or is this just not a profitable scenario?

15-05-26,37b4va,Recommendation for a good source of historical stock prices for research purposes?,"Greetings,

I am doing research on industry specific stock returns and risk for the last 10 years. In doing this I experience two main problems (A) Creating exhaustive lists of stocks and (B) Survivorship bias. 

Problem A: While it is not that hard to identify the industry a company belongs to it is hard to be sure whether the list is exhaustive (as in that it captures as much capitalization of a specific industry as possible), as in did I miss any companies with a specific industry classification? 

Problem B: Normally companies that no longer exist or are no longer openly traded are hard to detect. Because of that there is a risk of underestimating the risk of a certain industry, if I am only evaluating the companies that did ""survive""/are operating.  

Could anyone recommend me a source which would mitigate these issues (thus provide an exhaustive list of publicly listed (current and former companies) with preferably industry classifications)? 

Thank you for any feedback. 

Additional preferences would be that:
1- Dividends would be incorporated into historical prices 
2- It should include European stocks (as in companies incorporated in Europe as that is the focal point of research. I don't need North American stocks for example)
3- It can be in any European language, that is not a limitation for me",2

In my grandmother's old house, we found a certificate for 300 shares of ""Dime Financial Corp,"" given to me as a gift from 1987... 

Dime Financial Corp merged into Hudson United Bank (name changed to HUBCO). HUBCO merged with TD Banknorth. TD Banknorth acquired by TD Bank in a going private sale. TD Banknorth shareholders payed out $33.23/share.

I tried some brokers, but generally told they can't be of service. The transfer agent on the Dime certificate is ""Mellon Financial,"" which was purchased by Computershare. Computershare is ALSO the company listed as the agent on the TD Banknorth ""going-private"" deal. 

Computershare told me they are ""no longer the transfer agent for Dime Financial."" They directed me to ""First National Bank of Boston,"" which was I found was merged into BankBoston, and purchased by.... wait for it, wait for it... Computershare!

They say they have no record of the outstanding certificate. I also checked unclaimed property sites, and found nothing. 

So, any advice? I'm happy to hire someone, but it seems like the research companies are only able to tell me what I already know. I don't even know who to hire!

I have been involved with the year long reddit one, but I am not a fan involving many of the rules. Specifically, the starting capital and being able to buy and short penny stocks. It is unrealistic and allows for unfair competition for people who just start new accounts and gamble.

I made a game for the summer, it's 120+ days, and I think you will find the competition actually fun.

Main rules:

- Advanced Stock Market Game 

- Buying, Selling, Shorting, Margin, Stop Loss, and every other trade the game allows I enabled.

-Starting Capital: $1,000,000 (Hey, it's for fun right?! Maybe get ready for managing that huge portfolio in the future, namely your own ; pp )

-Minimum stock price $3.00 (I want to eliminate OTC penny stock trades and other micro cap stocks but still allow people to buy stocks on nasdaq etc., that are 4, 5, 6 dollars.)

-Trading Volume Limit 15% (Bumped up because of the short term nature but I want to keep it moderately realistic)

-Commission 4.99 (Everyone sets this at 10 and so many brokerages are much less, with stipulations, but still this is more feasible.)

So anyway, that's the game I made. I am playing myself regardless because I am excited about the modifications and excited to see what the markets have in store over the summer!!

Feel free to join or post thoughts!!

Thanks guys!!

EDIT: Oh btw you can trade stocks, funds, and ETF's. So don't be held back. Research companies, buy shares, and just have fun.

15-05-26,37bzzw,Why do people love Warren Buffett and hate George Soros?,"Both amassed huge fortunes without really working hard, both have given heavily to philanthropic causes, and expressed support for progessive causes, and they both seem like nice guys.  

Why is it that Soros has this robber baron/Bond villain image in the popular mind, whereas Buffett is admired by basically everyone?  Neither deserves hate, but both seem like they should be equally susceptible to it.  Soros has made some really good short bets that raised suspicions that he might have had a hand in causing the crashes that he profited from.  Buffett is the mastermind behind the largest conglomerate in the world, and his largest holdings are oil companies and banks like Exxon and J.P. Morgan Chase that are basically synonyms for ""evil"" corporatism.  Soros is a Jew who escaped the Nazis and Buffett is an old-money WASP, so they're both members of groups featured in new world order-type conspiracy theories. 

So why is Buffett the wise, friendly grandpa while Soros is basically Magneto?

DAVIDsTEA, which sells loose-leaf and pre-packaged teas across 158 stores primarily in Canada, announced terms for its IPO on Tuesday. 

The Quebec, Canada-based company plans to raise $77 million by offering 5.1 million shares (41% insider) at a price range of $14 to $16. At the midpoint of the proposed range, DAVIDsTEA would command a fully diluted market value of $388 million. 

Competitor Teavana went public in July 2011, and Starbucks bought the company for $670 million in November 2012. 

DAVIDsTEA, which was founded in 2008 and booked $142 million in sales for the 12 months ended January 31, 2015, plans to list on the NASDAQ under the symbol DTEA. Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan and BofA Merrill Lynch are the joint bookrunners on the deal. It is expected to price during the week of June 1, 2015.",0

15-05-27,37gtnu,Dividend Yields,"I see these posts about huge dividend yields and people thinking they are solid investments because it pays out so much, without bothering to think about the underlying stock price... Below is an example of why they are usually not returning what you think....

Stock X: price on Jan. 1 $20, 10% annual dividend

Paid $2 over the year, stock price is now $18 because it pays out all of its earnings (or even more than it earned), instead of reinvesting in the company. (Stock prices will very likely decline when the company does not reinvest anything). That means the next dividend will be 10% of $18, then 10% of $16... So you are not really earning a 10% yield because the price is deteriorating.

If you need further explanation, comment below.

* Near the 52 wk low, closed at 12.17, 52 week low of 11.82

* Down 17.5% in the last 30 days. 

* Is this a merger/acquisition candidate at this price?

* Valuation. Current market cap is $24.95B, 2014 net sales were $5.55B and total year ending assets $12.68B. 

* Net sales down over half since 2010.

15-05-27,37ho34,"New investor with $10,000. Use Greenblatt's ""Magic Formula?""","So just a disclaimer, I am a 20 year old, new to investing. I have read Graham's Intelligent Investor, as well as Klarman's Margin of Safety. While reading, I was able to understand some parts of each book while others were not so clear. After, I read Greenblatt's The Little Book that Beats the Market. This was much easier to understand as a new investor. 

Currently, I have 10k in Vanguard ETF's, as it is a common recommendation around here, but I am looking to get more serious with investing and wanted to try my hand at individual stocks. With the amount of money I have, would you recommend keeping some money in ETF's while purchasing some 20 or 30 stocks that meet Greenblatt's Magic Formula? Or would one recommend going all in with 20 or 30 stocks that meet the formula? I appreciate any insights.

EDIT: I'm also wondering if anyone could recommend readings about company valuation. I can understand the basic principles of value investing but when it comes to actually valuing a company (the most important aspect of the process), this is where I hit a roadblock. Additionally, if anyone has the time, I would be interested to hear the path which you took to build a good understanding of investing as a whole (for me, I have read the 3 listed books and am now stuck as to how to proceed).",2

Here's the question: during mergers/divestures past variation goes out the window so the underlying assumptions of these models are no longer true for a period of time. Wouldn't this be a great time to become involved in options for a stock?

[Capital Protection with Partecipation](http://www.six-structured-products.com/en/know-how/product-know-how/capital-protection-products/capital-protection-with-participation). It sounds interesting, since you can either get nothing from it or get something, but never lose anything, apart for any fee.
I then looked for them and found this: [VUMMS - Swq](http://www.swissquote.ch/sq_mi/public/market/Detail.action?s=CH0275671821_4_CHF) [VUMMS - cash](http://www.cash.ch/boerse/derivate/kursinfo/fullquote/suchresultat/VUMMS/2767285)
It's PDF  [here](http://services.payoff.ch/cash/product-report/?isin=CH0275671821&amp;cmd=exec) (Misleading!)
And some more info on six [here](http://www.six-structured-products.com/en/zertifikat/-CH0275671821)

Since it's traded at 985, but the capital protection is for 1000 (according to its Pdf ), why people don't buy it ? The protection is for 1000, so you should get back 1000.

Reading the link on six, the protection seems to be for 96% of 1000. I wonder why it's not written on the pdf though. This make more sense, so if I'll buy it now for 985 and nothing changes, I'll get back 960. Is that correct? What is that 4%? It doesn't seem like a big ""protection"" if they take 4% of it.

15-05-27,37fjv3,Effects of Various Economic Conditions on the Markets,"When I asked Pauline about writing a second guest post here, she suggested I talk about factors that will affect the average investor’s retirement nest egg. So in this post, I’ll be discussing the various economic and historical conditions that will affect investors in the medium tern (1-5 years) and long term future (5 to 10 years out), and how you can prepare yourself when each of these conditions hit.

Inflation
Without going into the arcane and pointless details, I’ll explain QE (quantitative easing) in good ole’ plain English. QE is the Federal Reserve’s way of printing money, thereby injecting more and more liquidity (money) into the financial system. Bernake (Fed Chairman) believes that this will pull the American economy out of the muck for good, and right now, whether this is working or not is still questionable.

HOWEVER, quantitative easing does have a problem – the printing of money theoretically speaking should cause inflation. But since QE first began, inflation has been virtually non-existent. How come?

According to theory, printing money causes inflation. BUT, what the economy has been experiencing post-recession is a deflationary environment. The economy isn’t doing too well, and prices should be declining. But with the Fed’s printing of money, the deflation is negated, resulting in zero inflation.

However, sooner or later (probably sooner, along the lines of 1 – 2 years) inflation is going to (finally) pick up. Why? Think of it this way. Deflation has always existed, and the Fed’s printing of money has been negating this deflation. However, soon that negation will be over (when the inflation is sufficient enough to totally negate the deflation), and the printing of money will finally cause real inflation.

So what do you do when inflation hits? Historically speaking, investors think that inflation is bad for stocks. That’s a huge misconception. This misconception only exists because stocks went flat in the 1970s when inflation was huge. HOWEVER, the 1970s were an anomaly – we experienced stagflation, when inflation was coupled with a sagging economy. In most cases, inflation occurs in a growing economy (or in today’s case, a nominally growing GDP). I believe that this time around, the recovery is real and that we’re not going to experience stagflation.

Hence, I think that buying stocks would be great when inflation hits. When inflation comes around, currencies get devalued and nominally speaking stock prices rise, leading to greater returns for equity investors.

Devaluation
Devaluation is closely linked to inflation – when governments print money, the real value of their currencies becomes devalued. Whenever currencies get devalued, all hard assets such as stocks and commodities shoot up in price. Speaking of commodities…

The Once in a Lifetime Opportunity
People believe that precious metals are a hedge against an economic downturn. Again, that’s a misconception. When the 2008 recession hit, precious metals (gold and silver) actually fell the hardest. This misconception originates (again) from the 1970s when a crappy economy was coupled with soaring gold and silver prices.

Precious metals rose in the 1970s not because of the poor economy but because of inflation. The 1970s were a rare case of stagflation, something that doesn’t fit in with today. Currently, the economy is humming along, but inflation will be a big issue. Thus, when inflation starts to creep up it will be a once in a lifetime opportunity for medium term investors who are willing to hold onto their gold and silver positions for at least a year.

The Fight for Resources
There’s a prime fundamental reason (besides inflation) that supports the rise in commodity prices (especially gold and silver). It’s simple. We have fewer and fewer resources to feed a larger and larger population. When Thomas Malthus first predicted that the world would end (this was back in 1798), he forgot to factor in technology. Technological improvements can increase the efficiency at which we extract our resources. HOWEVER, even technology has a limit. The efficiency is ultimately limited to the amount of resources we have. Currently, the world is reaching a turning point. If all the emerging market nations start to consume at the rate Americans do, the world’s resources would be gone sooner rather than later. When the demand for raw materials goes up and the supply goes down, prices will soar.

Historical Charts
You’ve all heard it – historically, the U.S. stock market has yielded (on average) 7.5% returns. That’s actually a really clever lie concocted by brokers and financial groups to get you to purchase equities.

The “average of 7.5%” is from the post-War period. If you look at a different time frame, such as if you were to include the Great Depression, the “average rate of return” is a lot less. That’s what the financial industry does – repackaging facts to make them look better than when they first came in.

The post-war period is actually an anomaly, a period of unprecedented economic growth that is unlikely to be repeated again in the near future. This growth was caused by major technological revolutions, from household appliances to computers to the internet and high speed communications. Today? Come on guys – the market is going to grow at 7.5% with a bunch of undergrads making $0.99 iPhone apps.

My point is, if the stock market is going to pick up its pace in the long run, it needs to be supported by major technological leaps. Unfortunately, since the dawn of the internet our society’s brightest have been attracted towards the fast money of internet riches, drawn away from solid industries that actually contribute to mankind’s life (think of space mining, green energy – the capital intensive industries). Thus, without any major technological revolutions happening right now how can we expect economic and market growth to pick up? We can’t. There’s no driver for the growth engine.

The Summary
To sum it all up, I’m going to divide things into two time frames. The medium time frame is the 1-5 year outlook, whereas the long term outlook is 5-20 years.

For the medium outlook, things are looking decidedly positive. Once inflation picks up (which is inevitable with all the money printing), stocks and commodities are going to soar, particularly gold and silver whose bull markets aren’t over.

However, the long term is less positive. Sure, the stock market will still experience long term bull markets. But I don’t think the average rate of return will be 7.5% anymore, unless we experience another major technological breakthrough. The problem is that these breakthroughs are the results of years and years of work, something that hasn’t happened thanks to all our smartest engineers being attracted to industries that do not really contribute that much to mankind. (I like Facebook as much as the next guy in line, but hey, it hasn’t had as much an impact on my life as the advent of the computer has.)",1

15-05-27,37id09,JBLU stock analysis/discussion,"I recently bought into Jet Blue, not only because I am a long term customer of the airline, but because i see growth potential for the company, and more importantly, the stock. Here are the reasons, and feel free to add anything you feel necessary. My background is a biology major who analyzes the stock market for fun in my ROTH IRA. So all of my stocks are bought with the idea that I will hold for at least 1-2 years, although a quick spike in a company can lead me to take my profit and run. I have only lost money in 1 stock (bought 10), and I am looking to get better at analysis.

Why I bought JBLU

I bought shares on 5/21, the day after the airline industry fell on the fear that lower fares would result from competition. I specifically selected JBLU because the average P/E of the airline industry hovers around 16.3, and JBLU was at 13 when I bought in. This alone showed me that there was room for upside in a company that I believe has growth potential, and therefore should be valued above 16 P/E

Why this company will grow?

JBLUE is expanding into the carribean and mexico. This offers increased coverage of its planes, and heading into the summer months where many people travel, an increase in flights to warm weather destinations could result in higher sales for JBLU. JBLU has also relied on the large airports to use as its base terminals, and not expand into the smaller airports. While this reduces its potential sales numbers, it both helps JBLU maintain the look of a premium airline (which can charge higher rates but still remain low-cost), and it offers it opportunity for growth in the event its current strategy is not producing the desired results. 

Oil:

This is a two-headed dragon. Oil prices are low right now, saving airline companies billions in fuel, which has not resulted in a decrease in prices yet. Some analysts believe that this is already priced into the stocks, but an extended period of oil below $60 per barrel will save the airlines a lot more money, and that looks to be exactly where we are headed. 

Most recent quarter:

JBLU's most recent earning were very good. They were able to decrease there expenses by 3%, with most of that coming from a decrease in fuel prices by 34%. If this continues, expect their to be even further savings in the second quarter. In addition, there was an almost 10% increase in flyers seen in the quarter, which shows that JBLU is increasing its customer base at a great rate, and it makes sense to think that it can increase its customer base even more through adding more destinations. Its revenue was also up 12.6% y/y, which helped reduce its P/E from the 16.38 that was seen before earnings, to its current level of 13, which suggests that it should be increasing in the coming months to match that P/E.

Customers:

The customers at JBLU are considered ""loyal,"" which means that typically these customers are returning. I for one return as a customer because of the in flight entertainment, which is unlike any airline I have encountered. Being able to select your own TV station or radio station enhances the flying experience dramatically, resulting in an increasingly loyal user base. In one study (http://aviationblog.dallasnews.com/2015/05/j-d-power-study-puts-alaska-airlines-jetblue-airways-at-top-of-customer-satisfaction.html/), JBLU ranked highest in customer satisfaction, and as the article states, ""JetBlue Airways ranks highest in the low-cost carrier segment for a 10th consecutive year, with a score of 801. This also marks the 11th consecutive year JetBlue has ranked highest in the study.[2] JetBlue improves in all seven factors year over year, most notably in reservation (+29) and boarding/deplaning/baggage (+22)."" This customer satisfaction means that a JBLU customer is unlikely to turn away from the airline, suggesting that the user base will continue to grow.

Price targets:

I rely on analysts for price targets because I do not claim to be an expert. I would love to see some input on how to calculate a good price target. I mostly use the P/E and overall company view and direction when picking a stock, and it has worked well so far. That being said, the analysts are also high on JBLU. Through my ROTH IRA, the stock analysis is rated ""very bullish"" with no analyst rating the stock ""underperform"" or ""sell."" One site I found had this to say: ""The 12 analysts offering 12 month price targets for JetBlue Airways Corporation have a median target of 24.50, with a high estimate of 28.00 and a low estimate of 19.00."" The ""high"" represents approximately a 40% gain, the median a 21% increase, and the low is only a 6% drop from where it closed today. These price targets are corroborated by other sites, and the consensus is a PT of approximately $25 per share. This may continue to be upgraded depending on how the ticket prices and oil price plays out over the summer months, but JBLU is primed to make a run over the summer months

TL;DR: consider JBLU if entering the airline industry, as it offers a lot of growth potential

DISCLAIMER: yes i own and am long JBLU. I wasnt paid, I was just bored on vacation. I looked into other airlines but felt that if i was to do a full blown airline sector analysis it would take days. Feel free to offer differing advice to people. DO NOT BUY THE STOCK BECAUSE I SAID SO. Please take the time and do your own research

15-05-28,37luu6,How to Conduct Due Diligence in China,"How to Conduct Due Diligence in China

 
Due Diligence in China should be a procedure taken before any business is conducted, not after. There have been some interesting news articles floating around about how both Chinese and foreign private investigators and lawyers alike do business in China and end up criminally punished for it. Until recently, the common approach to conducting due diligence in China has been more than a little shady by acquiring information through bribes and favors instead of the legitimate channels (which don’t quite exist yet) as well as a lack of knowledge in getting it through legitimate investigative methods that we used back in the 70’s, such as interviews.
Even though China has developed some reform to limit certain practices, it still is quite shady however and investigators and lawyers just don’t know how to adapt to the change. Parts of the problem lie in legal issues and restraints against the industry, others are caused by lack of creativity and experience.
In the LA Times, an article titled ‘In China, The Dangers of Due Diligence‘ details how Mr. Humphrey, a foreign private investigator and his wife Yu, are reported to be currently serving a two year sentence in Chinese prison for their attempt to uncover a corruption scheme on behalf of a foreign company doing business in China. They admitted to allegedly purchasing information from businesses and government officials in order to secure phone numbers, citizen registrations, car and home ownership registrations. Which, is all completely illegal.
The Current Situation in China for Law &amp; Commerce.
Going to China with the intent to do business or conduct an investigation would be a similar equivalent as traveling back in time 40+ years to conduct the same in a western country. China is still a developing nation and this means that there are so many laws and business practices which western countries have developed over the years through trial and error which help direct the way people do business and shaped our business culture today. These same principles are NOT a part of the Chinese methodology yet. They are still working on it so we have to understand that their methods of doing business are not as evolved. This doesn’t mean you should adopt their current strategies for doing business however as it can be very risky.

 
Common Legal Practices in China
When a person gets in trouble with the law due to some petty crime, it may be common for the police to produce an unofficial fine that is not controlled or administered by any court or legal proceeding.
When a person is injured in some accident, assault or is caught red handed committing petty theft against another person, there is no court proceeding or dealing with insurance companies. The police will force the accuser to pay the victim a sum of cash, usually amounting to at least 5000元 ($806) or more. This is paid up front and once the business is completed, the situation is no longer of any concern.

 

 
The problem with the current private investigation industry in China.
At this moment, Chinese law does not allow for the same ease of access into public records or information as western countries. Chinese private investigators, investors, business partners and corporations do not even do the same due diligence that is so important to us westerners. Government and police departments also do not legally give out information to check a person’s legitimacy, nor can you go to any government office and legally obtain some background information, address history, check property ownership and so forth which is so readily available in the US. The most troubling part is that this same information is considered personal and quite illegal to obtain if purchased or bribed from a third party.
When a Chinese private investigator conducts a due diligence investigation, they don’t utilize search databases, nor do they go to courts and police departments to conduct research inquiries or conduct undercover interviews. They more than not will locate a top tier government official, an employee in a corporation,  or a business partner each who can provide or produce any type of record or inside information they may need and they will bribe with a hefty sum of cash or offer some favor to secure that specific information. Bribery is still a huge business practice for most Chinese people. Recently however, the government began to crackdown on corruption under a new reform after President Xi started a campaign against corruption.
Due to this new reform, police raids have been taken against private investigator agencies who are now planning to leave the industry and shut down shop due to their inability to cope with the change. The Atlantic reported in ‘China’s Chilling Crackdown on Due Diligence‘ that 126 people in Shanghai alone have been arrested for illegally obtaining personal information for which the penalty is 2 to 3 year in jail.  The solution is an easy one however. Go old school. If you can’t go to some legal source, there are still social ones that are very legal to gather information from.

 

 
The root of the problem
Under the western mentality, due diligence may be of extreme importance for investing and developing business partnerships but In China, not so much. Although there is a huge importance, people seem to wait until a problem arrives to conduct it.
The Chinese strategy for developing business or political relationships is to provide and receive favors. So corporations and law firms seeking or attempting to do some type of business in China need to adapt to the environment with creative solutions.
The problem is, people don’t seem come up with a creative workaround to create a solution to these problems. Lawyers and businesses hire investigators in China under a “no questions asked” mentality and would rather not know how any information was obtained.

 
Being Creative (Do What the Chinese Do)
Things to do Before doing business with Chinese customers, partners or investment opportunities.
Demand they provide you with
A contract
A copy of their Chinese ID
A copy of at least 2 bank cards (It is common to have multiple bank accounts in China)
A credit card statement (This gives address information)
QQ number
We Chat ID
Give them a questionnaire –
Ask for details about high school and university (basically a resume)
Ask for their business and home addresses, then follow up
Ask for copies of business licenses
Ways to Verify a Person’s Identity
On the social media sight Ren Ren (China’s Facebook). There is an option to find people by name, school and city.
With a cell phone number, you should be able to locate an individual’s We Chat account.
You can legally verify a Chinese business so don’t worry, but you have to do this through legal channels.
Bank statements in China do not provide information such as a home or billing address but credit card statements do.
It is not illegal to require or ask for this information upfront from the individual in question, it is illegal to obtain it from a third party without their consent.

 
If you are cheated, go to the Chinese police with all acquired information and evidence then file a formal complaint. They will act on it, but apply pressure and concern. It is also advisable to connect with a Chinese lawyer.
What NOT to do when conducting any type of investigation in China
It is illegal to pay someone to obtain the following as they are considered ‘personal information':
phone records or a phone number
Address information
Hukous (Citizen registration)
Car &amp; Home ownership Registration
Asking for something is different than paying for it but beware that a pretext may be considered a fraudulent way to access personal information as well.
It is illegal to bribe a government or corporate official for information or favors.
Even though there are many illegitimate methods that are common practice, they are still illegal so do your best to avoid it at all costs and make sure your investigator does not favor these methods and tells you exactly what they plan to do or you may just find yourself charged with conspiracy or be forced to pay heavy fines as a result.",0

15-05-27,37g59u,How to analyze a property as an investment,"I know you are busy.

However, just because you are busy – doesn’t mean you shouldn’t seek to find an amazing deal when shopping for a rental property. In fact – I believe it’s because of your busy life that finding the best deal is so important. You don’t want to be stuck with a property that drains your time, empties your wallet, and makes you want to throw your tenant’s belongings off a twelve-story building.

Shopping smart is key, but at the same time – smart shopping doesn’t need to take forever. There are several “quick and dirty” techniques you can use to look at an investment property and decide if it’s something worth pursuing. This post is going to share my method for finding the best needles in the real estate haystack.

 How to analyze a property as an investment

What Metrics to Measure
For me, cash flow is king.

Cash flow, in it’s simplest definition, is the profit left over in my bank account after all the bills have been paid on arental property. For example, if a property rents for $500 per month and all my expenses for the month come to $400 – then I’ve just made $100 in cash flow.

Cash flow is important because it adds money to my bank account each month, rather than take money away. It helps me save more and gives me a scorecard for measuring my investment’s potential.

The other side of the coin is “appreciation,” which is the value gained when real estate prices rise. While appreciation is a welcome thing, (I love when my property values rise) I don’t use appreciation to determine a good deal. After all – there is no way of predicting the future since my crystal ball broke last year. Appreciation is simply the icing on the cake, but should not be used to determine an investment’s future value. Again – for me, it’s all about cash flow.

So how much cash flow is good? We’ll get to that in a minute, but first- let’s look at the quick and dirty way to calculate it.

Knowing Your Expenses: The 50% Rule
One of the most valuable “tools” to a real estate investor is known as the 50% rule. This “rule of thumb” states that for a real estate investment – the non-mortgage expenses will usually average out to about 50% of the rent.

Huh?

Let me explain. If you own a 4-plex that brings in $2,000 per month – you can probably assume that over the long run, this property is going to cost $1000 per month in vacancies, maintenance, and other charges (not counting the mortgage.)

Now, it’s easy to estimate your monthly cash flow by simply taking the amount of money you have left (known as the Net Operating Income) and subtracting out the monthly mortgage payment – which you can find using any online mortgage calculator. My favorite is this one.

For the example we’ll use in this post, let’s assume we bought the 4-plex for $140,000 and put a $28,000 down payment for a total loan amount of $112,000. At an interest rate of 5% for 30 years, the loan payment works out to approximately $600 per month. Additionally, this four plex rents for $500 per unit, per month, for a total of $2,000 per month in rental income.

Going back to that first example, here’s how it would look:

Monthly Rent: $2,000 per month

-$1,000 per month (50% Rule)

- $600 per month (Imaginary mortgage payment for this example)

———————————————————

= $400 per month in cash flow.

Now – you may be tempted to argue with me that 50% for expenses is high – and maybe you are right. However, this “rule of thumb” has been used by a lot of seasoned investors for many years for one reason: because it seems to just work. Maybe you’ll have no expenses for several months, and then be hit with a ton (like me, this month!) Maybe your roof will go bad and need to be replaced. Maybe the heating system will go out. Maybe you’ll have an eviction. The 50% rule allows you to look at cash flow over the long run, which is why I advocate using it. If it ended up being less – you win! But at least you won’t be tempted to buy a property that is actually going to cost you money to own (negative cash flow…bad.)

So, back to our example… is $400 per month in cash flow good? Well, maybe. Let me explain how I determine it.

How Much Cash Flow is Right?
For me – it comes down to 3 different methods:

Return on Investment: Your return on investment is the tool used to calculate your investment’s use. If a $1,000 investment gave you $100 in profit over a full year, your ROI (return on investment) was 10%. So, let’s look back at that example of the four-plex. We determined that we could expect about $400 per month in cash flow with a $600 per month mortgage payment and a $28,000 investment (down payment.) $400 per month is $4,800 per year. $4,800/$28,000 = 17.14% return on investment. Also keep in mind that this ROI does not include any appreciation, tax benefits, or loan pay down (each month, the balance on the loan drops a little bit.) Officially, this number is known as your “cash on cash return on investment” and is a good way to compare your investment with other investments like stocks, bonds, or mutual funds.
Per-Unit-Profit: Even more quick and dirty than the ROI measurements, sometimes it’s enough just to look at the “profit per unit.” This means – if I were to buy this property, would I clear a certain price per unit in cash flow? This is truly the “quick and dirty” way to analyze a property: begin with the total monthly income and use the 50% rule to take out the expenses. Next, subtract the mortgage amount. Using the example we discussed earlier, the fourplex supplied $400 per month in cash flow – or $100 per unit, per month – which is the minimum amount I’d ever generally accept though I like to see $200 per unit, per month.
The 1% Rule
Another “rule of thumb,” I should mention, and the fastest way to quickly decide if a property is worth pursuing, is known as the 1% rule. The 1% rule states that an investment property should rent for at least 1% of the purchase price. So, the fourplex we discussed earlier – which was bought for $140,000 – should bring in at least $1400 per month in total income (which, according to our example, it does meet.)

Some investors choose other ratios, such as the 1.5% rule or the 2% rule to achieve greater returns and greater cash flow. I typically won’t buy anything below 1.5% and try to aim for 2%, though your percentage may depend on your location and risk tolerance.

Conclusion
Did I lose you? Hopefully you stuck with me on these calculations!

The methods I mentioned above can be used to quickly analyze an investment property for further investigation. With thousands of properties listed for sale at any time, it’s simply impossible to do a thorough analysis of each. This is why these “quick and dirty” methods can be great for filtering properties and only looking at the best options.

One final disclaimer: never buy a property based entirely upon one of these methods. This is a way to filter out the 99% of properties that are not good deals and only focus on the best. Do your homework and learn what the actual expenses and income are, and buy amazing properties.

No matter how busy you are – I encourage you to spend some time trying out your new math skills to analyze some properties. Once you are good at it, you’ll be able to decide if a property is worth pursuing in just seconds – saving you time and helping you build wealth at the same time.",1

Lets say I have $10000 and want to short TAXI, and I buy a contract at 7.50 and it drops to 6.00. How much money will be made in this scenario? What happens if I sell a contract at 5.00 and it only drops to 6.00?",5

That's not what stood out the most tho. Their cheif executive has been apart of some major business acquisitions with other companies. I see them being bought out and the stock soaring off of that PR. Hopefully within the next 6 months. 
I know this isn't a Yolo atm, but I figure it will be worth it in a little while. Plus, you can't beat the stock price so adding a thousand shares isn't that big of a risk for a major payout.

15-05-28,37mz7t,Potential dividend arbitrage opportunity: FUR and its liquidating distribution,"*Please offer insight on this strategy*

FUR (Winthrop Realty) is in the process of liquidation.

From Globe Newswire: ""Winthrop Realty Trust (NYSE: FUR) (""Winthrop"") announced today that its Board of Trustees has declared a liquidating distribution of $1.25 per common share payable in cash on June 16, 2015 to common shareholders of record on June 9, 2015. The liquidating distribution is being paid from the net proceeds of recent sales of Winthrop's assets.""

The ex-dividend date is 6/5. Right now, you can buy the FUR Jun 17.50 put for a bit more than $1 (ask is $1.20). If you buy the stock at the current market price of $16.73 and buy the 17.5 put at $1.20, your debit will be $17.93. However, your guaranteed return is $18.75 ($17.50 + $1.25).

Anyone see any problems with this? I verified with Scottrade that the ex-dividend date is 6/5 and the payment date is 6/16, both of which are before the expiration of the put on 6/19. I was worried that because this is a liquidating distribution, it might trade with a bill until after the payment date, making the put expire before the real ex-dividend date, but I have seen 0 evidence of this.

I see a guaranteed 5% return (200% annualized) with a minute potential for upside if the stock goes above $17.5. What am I missing?",3

2.   a 2% dip will cause a selling frenzy, 
3.  10% is a ""pullback"" and will cause widespread hysteria.
4.  When there is a dip...BUY.  

Like I said, yesterday was amusing and educational at the same time.  I love this sub and a heartfelt thank you to all of you because it's your experiences that help people like me to grow and make well intention educationally informed decisions.  ",0

15-05-27,37gs6r,A strategy for accumulating under valued stocks,"I want to know what reddit thinks about trying to accumulate stocks during times of recession versus growth. During a recession, companies that exploit the misery ( like pawn shops, loan companies, alcohol) should be doing well. So right now, since the stock market is trading at all time highs, I'd imagine those stocks should be trading fairly low.

So my thinking is that right now, I should be loading up on pawn shops and such, and when the recession inevitably hits, switch over to buying blue chips or even just the SP 500 index.

15-05-28,37n2k2,Potential Dividend Arbitrage Opportunity: FUR and its Liquidating Dividend,"*Please offer insight on this strategy*

FUR (Winthrop Realty) is in the process of liquidation.

From Globe Newswire: ""Winthrop Realty Trust (NYSE: FUR) (""Winthrop"") announced today that its Board of Trustees has declared a liquidating distribution of $1.25 per common share payable in cash on June 16, 2015 to common shareholders of record on June 9, 2015. The liquidating distribution is being paid from the net proceeds of recent sales of Winthrop's assets.""

The ex-dividend date is 6/5. Right now, you can buy the FUR Jun 17.50 put for a bit more than $1 (ask is $1.20). If you buy the stock at the current market price of $16.73 and buy the 17.5 put at $1.20, your debit will be $17.93. However, your guaranteed return is $18.75 ($17.50 + $1.25).

Anyone see any problems with this? I verified with a Scottrade representative (hope he knows what he's talking about) that the ex-dividend date is 6/5 and the payment date is 6/16, both of which are before the expiration of the put on 6/19. I was worried that because this is a liquidating distribution, it might trade with a deferred ex-dividend date that takes place after the put has expired, but I have seen 0 evidence of this.

I see a guaranteed 5% return (200% annualized) with a minute potential for upside if the stock goes above $17.5. What am I missing?",0

15-05-29,37o0zy,Changing the Future of Investing,"A couple of months back, a company calledrPlan got in touch with me. I am usually very skeptical about almost most emails/inquiries that I receive through SavvyScot if I’m honest… from dodgy freelancers who want to write a post in exchange for 100 high quality link backs, to people wanting to buy the blog outright; most authors will have experienced similar requests. I decided to check it out anyway and was pleasantly surprised. The concept behind rPlan is to make investing easier – the company’s aim is to create an online environment that allows investors to make informed decisions.
First Impressions
Upon visiting their homepage, instantly one fact cried out to me:
49% of investors in the UK don’t know how their portfolios performed in the last year
WHAT?! I mean seriously… come on guys. Tracking wealth is one of the basic rules of personal finance. Over the next couple of days, this statistic got me thinking about why this could be.
Did people simply have so much money that they didn’t care?
Did people forget about their investments?
Perhaps they didn’t fully understand what the investment was?
Maybe they found it too difficult to understand how to measure performance?
In reality, I think the reason is a combinations of the second two points. Investment tracking is definitely not easy and my guess is that people would rather forget about it and hope for the best. This simply isn’t good enough!
rPlan aims to change this. rPlan aims to make investing easy and give people easy access to key information. In addition to this, there are a number of financial incentives, including a rebate in commission that they receive and capped charges.
Wow this sounds good right? Almost too good to be true! Behold, I have reviewed the product for you! Furthermore, if they deem it to be the best review out of a small series (from other PF bloggers), I could win an iPhone 5… Given that I am highly competitive individual and frequently perform User Acceptance Testing in my career, I have given this some serious research and thought. That said, this review is totally impartial and my honest opinion. To those of you who think this is a boring review and might stop reading… I urge you to continue. There are some great features that I want to discuss!
I’ll start by talking about the overall structure of the site. The site is split into four main areas: Analyze, Invest, Plan and Share.  The rPlan website and portal interface has an overall simplistic and minimalistic feel to it – definitely a good start when it comes to investing! While the site is divided into the four distinct areas, the review will focus mainly on the Analytics side – essentially the most important area for an investor.
Analyse
Overview
Being able to easily track and analyse your portfolio is key to maintaining it’s health. If you are a visual person like myself, the screenshot below gives you an overview of how the portal looks and feels. There are three main summary boxes:
 Dashboard
Cost – This figure represents the total cost that your portfolio carries (usually through Investment fund fees) annually. This is a very important figure and I would highly recommend the team include a feature that calculates the actual cost of your portfolio, instead of just the percentage. This would further simplify making investment decisions. The question marks that you can make out below (next to ‘cost’) expand to give an explanation of the term and an additional link to further explanation.
Risk – This currently represents the overall risk of your portfolio on a scale of 1 to 6. I love this feature, however think that a simple modification would make a greater impact – changing the colour of the number as the risk gets higher. For example a low risk level (1) could be Green, a medium risk yellow and a high risk dark red. This would highlight the associated risk better – which is essentially the most important factor of investment. Perhaps a scale of 1-10 would also be easier to understand.
Performance 12 Months – This statistic shows the average performance of your portfolio over the last 12 months. While I think this is a useful feature, I would prefer it to show the percentage gain/loss since initial investment. I feel that this would be a more relevant figure, given that 12 months might not mean much for new investments.
A minor detail, but I think the descriptions could be made bigger. I would also like to see a change in style of the relevant heading you are currently viewing in the text in the top right hand side of the page. For example, I am currently in ‘Analyse’ so would like to see it a different colour / bold / highlighted in some way. This will help overall navigation and understanding of the portal hierarchy / structure.
Charts &amp; Graphs
This is where rPlan get’s interesting. As I just mentioned, I am a very visual person and would much rather look at a chart / diagram / picture than read a paragraph of text. The Charts &amp; Graphs section shows 4 main charts: Past Performance, Allocation, Risk, Geography. These charts are simple, yet highly effective.
Past Performance – This shows the past success of your investment over a variable time scale. (3m, 6m, 1y, 2y, 3y, 5y) I think rPlan have done really well to keep this simple, yet give enough variety of presets for changing the time period. Some other finance analytical websites have very complicated sliders and check boxes to change the timescale (which often doesn’t work well).
Allocation – This pie chart shows assets by type and category. The labels clearly indicate which countries I have investments in and also the asset type (equity, fixed income etc.) Simple, yet effective
 
Risk – As before, this shows the calculated level of risk of the portfolio. I feel this chart could be developed further to show dimensional risk – i.e. where the different levels of risk actually come from and to show the overall combined risk.
  Geography - This is quite probably my favourite overall feature of rPlan. A simple world map shows the percentage of your portfolio that is invested in each country. By hovering over a country, the percentage is shown – as demonstrated below with Thailand. I think this feature is absolutely fantastic and a great way to track how investments fund managers change their strategies! I feel this could be further improved by using a better colour scale and to label countries with high proportions of your overall investment.
 
In summary, the analytics are fantastically simple, yet clear and detailed. The data could easily be extracted into a mobile app to enable you to check performance on the move. Great work guys!
Share
I love this section of the website. Essentially the sharing section is a forum – a platform to discuss investing options and strategies between members. Obviously as I review the product, the forum is very much in BETA testing mode so it is hard to comment on specifics. Furthermore, there is the option to create private groups and restrict access to your boards. Hopefully the team behind rplan have measures in place to monitor insider / illegal trading.
Given that you have to sign up to invest to access the forum, it should prevent trolls / spamming. I am excited to see how the various threads develop.
 Screenshot from the Forum
Any Advice… anyone???
 
Closing thoughts
Overall, I love how rPlan has made it easy to obtain a high-level overview of your portfolio – a snapshot of performance. For those of us who are a little obsessed with investments and like to track them multiple times per day (I know I’m not the only one) – this is a very nifty feature! The portal is clean and friendly. Unlike a lot of other financial tools, it is not cluttered and full of uninteresting information. The virtual portfolio provides an excellent way to ‘practice’ investing before you take the plunge. rPlan has a wealth of experience in the start-up team and I am excited to see what the future holds. Good job guys!

15-05-28,37jzsy,Advice on mutual fund investment,"Hi,

I am planning to start investing my money in mutual funds under general savings accounts(Taxable). I'll start this year by investing 20k. I'll be putting similar amount every year. My goal is long term i.e. i'll not take money out unless it is required and as of now i have a stable (ish) job which can cover my expenses and some cash for emergencies.

I want to create a diversified portfolio with decent return like 10% and moderate to aggressive risk (I am 28). I don't want to manage it everyday. 

After some investigation online, i realize that index funds are the best to invest for long terms.

Here are few funds i was thinking:

Large Blend:
1. Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund(VITPX) - 6%
2. Vanguard 500 index fund VFINX - 6%

Large Value:
1. Vanguard value index fund (VIVAX) - 12%

Small Value:
1. VISVX - 12%

Small Blend:
1. NAESX -  12%

MidCap Blend
1. VEXMX - 12%

Foreign Large Blend
1. VTMGX - 10%

Foreign Large Value
1. VTRIX - 10%

Real Estate
1. VGSIX - 5%

Apart from that, i came across few fund of funds which have good reviews like:
1. VASGX - 6%
2. VGSTX - 6%
3. VWELX - 6%
4. VWINX - 6%

I already have 401k and IRA account where i put some money each year.

I'm about halfway there, and currently have about 2/3 of my savings in cash (savings account with negligible interest) and 1/3 in an S&amp;P 500 index fund.

As I continue to save, I'm mainly just piling more cash into my savings account at this point since I'm wary of putting too much into the stock market in case there's a correction and I suddenly lose so much money that I have to put off buying a home by several months or even more than a year.

I don't need to access this money on short notice; I always keep enough cash in my savings account to cover any realistic emergency situations and pay for all my expenses for 6 months assuming my income dropped to zero. But everything beyond that comfortable cushion needs to go somewhere that I can access with a few weeks' notice once I surpass 20% of my target home price and find the right house. What's the smartest thing to do with that money? Bonds? CDs?",0

15-05-29,37onku,ELI5: How does one actually take advantage of a bond yield?,"Hi, r/investing,

I have a quick question: how does one actually go about taking advantage of a bond's yield. As I understand it, a bond has a principal value, let's say $100, which is paid to the investor at the maturation date (say, in a year). However, the buyer doesn't buy the bond for $100, he or she would buy it for less, let's say $95, and receive the $100  principal on the maturation date. 

Furthermore, there is a coupon, which is an specified interest rate which is fixed and paid on the initial investment quarterly (or annually for longer maturation dates). This coupon could be something like 2% which, when combined with the additional money in the principal, compensates the investor for the temporary loss of money.

Now, all of this is *different* from the yield on the bond as I understand. There are markets for bonds, and the prices of the bonds in these markets reflects inflation, the current interest rates of the bonds, and what we expect the future interest rates to be. 

Now, the yield of the bond is the effective interest rate of our bond that is encoded within the price in these markets. So, let's say I have a bond that has a coupon of 2%, and I see in some financial reports that the yield is 5%. How do I go about taking advantage of this supposed profit? Do I just sell my bond in these markets, and the price I sell it for will be the same *as if* I had a coupon of 5% and held it to maturity?

Note: this is for educational purposes only, I don't actually own any bonds. ",1

I ordered a book ""Intelligent investor"" and I'm 1/3 way through it but it's a hard read. I get the general idea about diversification (say if you got 10k, don't hold it all in 1 stock etc), the approach that there might be a bad day for stocks/funds and there may be a good day. Also the historical commentary is quite insightful and shows how WRONG people were many times in the past.
The problem is that the nitty gritty stuff is very hard to get. I read somewhere that Intelligent Investor is a bad First book because it's quite heavy and doesn't explain stuff for a noob. 

So I have a couple of questions:

1. Best books to explain in plain english X works like this and that etc.

2. I currently have £16,000 (UK) in my account just sitting on ISA, doing nothing. I was thinking about getting a mortgage but at the age of 25 do I really need it? Maybe it would be better to put say 10k in the stocs/bonds etc? If I get the mortgage then I'm tied basically, plus the rates might jump at some point. I'm thinking about investing for 10-15 years - basically longterm. I have a good career in IT and decent salary so I don't need to rely on the income from dividends etc to help me out. 

3. How much can I expect to get back if I say invest 10k, for 10 years? I know stocks, bonds etc give all different yields and depending on the market. But over 10 years on average how much would I get back?

Hello everyone.  Introducing my three legged YOLO moon beam.  Am considering fattening up on more AMD calls today, I estimate the AMD name alone to be worth around $50bn so this is a no brainer value play.

FXCM epic fail.

**What I think will happen to NBG this year**  
Europe forgive the NBG debt (I'm not sure if that's exactly how it all works).  NBG release their world wide online banking platform which is amazing and every decides to use it.  Free olives for everyone who signs up a new account, takes the world by storm.  They end up buying CITI group and BARC in an unprecedented deal at the end of 2015.

FBI investigates me for buying options before any of this was public knowledge as I'm now rich off NBG options.

**FXCM**  
A trickier one to analyse.  Hoping they pivot into operating systems as there's a good opportunity now MSFT is looking a bit shaky.

**AMD**  
The Time Square advertising campaign has been a huge success, my grandma saw it on the TV and when I came home to her basement the next day to tuck in to bed she'd bought a stack of AMD gpu's to add more ram to her iPad 2.  Just goes to show that advertising can make up for a signifcant shortcoming in product quality and reach new audiences.  High hopes for this one hitting Saturn sometime in summer.  AMD could be the Apple of circuit boards, exciting stuff.

**ZNGA**  
I'll admit this one is just gambling.  ZNGA is a shit company, but it's full of pumpers.  Hoping to catch a wave up with all their new cack games being released at the moment and dump these options on some other idiot before everyone realises that no one wants to spend more than $1 on a mobile game.

I used a gaussian fit to compute the standard deviation, which will be my indicator for risk of the ETF. You could also say that **~68%** of days the ETF was either up by **0.56%** or down by **0.56%**.

Now I need to come up with an indicator for the reward/sucess of the ETF. The easiest way would be to just get the slope of a linear fit or I might use an exponensial fit. 

It's pretty basic. What are your thoughts?",6

15-05-28,37kxsi,Investment funds or stocks? How do I know where to put my money for a long-term investment?,"I can begin by saying I am new to investing.

I want to invest in something more long-term. Question is, how do I know where to put my money and what should I expect etc. My risk tolerance is pretty moderate, I would say. I don't want to lose my savings, so I'd rather have something more ""secure"", even if it'd take a couple of years for the money to grow substantially.

Should one spread the risk and buy several different funds? Can I regularly put more money into the fund or is there a catch to that? (regularly setting a side money from my wage, but I'm a poor student with a part-time job, so shiz is rough out here)

Keep in mind that I don't have *that* much money. I'm talking about +-2000 USD. It's not a lot, but I want to start somewhere.

Any advice are appreciated. Links to guides and so on are also very welcomed!",21

15-05-29,37ptej,Beating the market or: How I learned to stop index-funding and love the research process," This subreddit is highly focused on index funds but I would like to share my thoughts on how to beat the market with an active approach (i.e. by not buying index funds - not active as in day/week/trading) to investing. My hope is to get a discussion going where the active investors of this sub can share their thoughts on the markets and give tips to other investors. 

 I am a firm believer in the classic value investing statement: You can't beat the market if you think like the market. To beat the market you have to think outside the box/be a contrarian and most importantly: be right in your contrarian views. If the market thinks something is going to grow a lot over the next years, the market price will reflect that. Tesla is an example. It is priced for perfection and you can't expect outperformance (in the short run maybe but not in the long run) unless it tops these crazy expectations. Therefore I mainly look for value in places where the investor sentiment is neutral or negative. Over my five years as an investor I have found only a handful of stocks (nine to be exact) where my views differed greatly from the market's view and where I had a strong belief that I was right. Nine stocks over five years doesn't sound like much but they have delievered sizeable outperformance compared to my benchmark. 

 One of the ways I improve my chances of having a correct contrarian view is by focusing on less followed stocks. If you invest in highly followed stocks you have to have an opinion about the future that is better than 10+ professional analysts. I don't like those odds. Therefore I focus mainly on small caps and smaller mid caps with only a few analysts (if any at all). Small companies are on average subject to a higher degree of mispricing and provides great opportunities for investors who are willing to dig deep and do original, quality research. My research process is long and thorough but can be summed to this: ""What is the company's intrinsic value and how sure am I in my estimate? What can reveal the true worth of the company (catalysts)? What are the risks (how much can I potentially lose)?""


 As written: I hope that other active investors will join and share their investing philosophy/process/other thoughts!

15-05-29,37qzo6,How I spent three months learning all about market timing.,"Those who may have seen some of my posts in the past may know I'm a strong proponent of momentum investing and leverage.  Today I'm not here to advocate aggressive investing.  Today I'm here to share a short story about how I ignored everything I learned before entering the market, and the thought process that went with each step along the way.

[Here's a chart so you can follow along on the adventure!](http://i.imgur.com/UzepagT.png)

**March 1st:** (I should invest today).  I cashed out of my target date fund and I'm ready to put my strategy I've worked on for 2 months into play.  The market is up right now.  Yeah yeah, time in the market vs. timing the market, but squeezing 1% extra per share isn't the same as 20% per share.  With a few thousand dollars to burn, it's time to do something ative.

**March 2nd-16th:** (waiting is boring).  Well, the market is going down.  Looks like I made the right decision to wait...

**March 17th:** (Whatever, forget waiting).  The market has started going back up.  I bought my first 24 shares of TQQQ at 105.29.  I'm out of money but fully invested. Let the games begin!

**March 4th-April 16th:** (Shit, the market moves around a lot.) This was a good emphasis on why we don't time the market.  The market fluctuated all over the place and didn't move much in the long term.  A bad month for leveraged decay.

**April 15th:** (more money, more stock!)  I came into some extra money and maxed out my IRA for 2014.  32 more shares purchased for $109.98, bringing my average investment to $107.97 for 56 shares.

**April 17th:** (Shit.  I should have waited.) We're back down to $103.79.  I could have DCA'd down instead of up, but I panicked and bought high.

**April 17th-April 23rd:** (Holy shit I'm rich.)  The market reached $117.36 today.  I'm up nearly 10% per share!  Leveraged investing was totally a good decision!

**April 24th:** (Let's give this timing thing a shot.) Today was the day when it all fell apart.  Looking at the past two months of ups and downs, I made the (baseless) assumption that this breakout would be corrected shortly.  I sold my stock to see what happens.  All shares sold at $115.48 for a 6.7% locked-in return.  Not bad, I'm at long-term the average annual S&amp;P return in only 6 months.  Keep at this pace and I could retire in about 10 years!

**April 25th:** (Called it!) Well I nailed that right on the head.  The market has started its trip back down!  I put in a buy-back offer at $105.00, my initial investment value.  Lock in over 100% of my profits!

**April 26th-May 5th:** (Wheeee!): I enjoyed the roller coaster ride down.  I just about nailed the price.  Unfortunately, I didn't nail it.  The market closed at 105.42 and started moving back up.  Shit...

**May 11th:** (Shit...) A market bounce, down 1%.  Maybe I can get back in.  Let's avoid making the same mistake and buy back in at around DCA price of $107.00.  We learned a lesson about being greedy and we won't be making the same mistake.

**May 13th:**  (Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice...)  $108.52 was the bottom out point.  Again, I missed my mark by under 2%.  At least my guesses are accurate.  I'll keep the offer in and see what happens over the next few days.

**May 18th:** (Well, there goes that plan.) The market hits $115.30  We're up near my sell price.  Well that whole adventure was pointless...

**May 21st:** (...I fucked up...) The market finally clears my buy price.  I've officially lost profit by being out of the market.  Today I begrudgingly adjusted my buy price to $112

**May 27th:** (""I want to get off MR BONES WILD RIDE"") The market hit 112.61 at the end of the day and then jumped to $118.03.  I'm never going to make money off this.  Let's power through and hope for the best...

**May 29th (Today):** (I give up.) The market hit 114.50 and I watched it.  I thought about adjusting my offer for a moment.  I didn't.  The market then went up and bounced back down to $114.90 while I watched and contemplated.  I put in an offer for $115.00 but by the time I finished, the market was up to $115.30.    And then $115.70.  And now $116.86.  And I fucked up big time.    

**2:15 PM** (Lesson learned!)  I will close out this adventure with a filled buy order at 1:55 PM having learned from my mistakes, and buying back in at 116.42.  The price may go down to my break-even point.  It's gone down since that purchase.  But I'm OK with that.  I've come too close only to be disappointed too many times, and I will take my 0.9% lost profit as a lesson well learned.

#**TLDR:**

I was surprisingly accurate (within 1% almost every time) at predicting the market trend.  And even so, hesitation and overconfidence screwed me in a variety of ways each week.  The stress of the last three months wasn't worth the $60 lost and the ""fun"" of active investing at all.  I could never imagine trying something like this with hundreds of thousands of dollars, and I've learned my lesson.  I am prone to gambling addiction and now I can admit it for certain.

My advice to followers of this adventure: Don't try and out-preform your own tested strategies with untested ones.  Trust your research and the research of those who have been there before.  Don't trust in yourself to beat yourself!",0

How old are you? 22y/o college student


Are you employed/making income? How much?

Part time during the school year/ some full time weeks during the summer. Not making a lot but a fulltime job is guarenteed at a survivable pay after graduation. 


What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)

No real objectives here except make more money to keep investing and grow a portfolio. If I could make some money towards student loans after I graduate that would be nice. 

What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)

I'm prepared to lose it. It wont make or break me. 


What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)

Nothing. Brand new to investing. 


Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)

Have a reliable car thats fully paid off. No mortgage, no wife, no kids. 


What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?

Whenever. The way I see it is if I dont invest it i'll probably spend it on something dumb.

15-05-29,37r6sk,LEAPS option strategy question,"So I have been investigating some LEAPS options, and I really like the idea of a Fig Leaf strategy. It has other names, but essentially, you buy a call a year or more out, and sell short-term calls along the way that you think will expire out of the money. It's a bullish strategy and as your LEAPS call theta decays, you are hoping that the value of it at least offsets as the stock rises, meanwhile you are cashing in on the short term OTM calls you are selling.

Now my question is around the exact same thing, but with puts. It seems that every options strategy has a direct opposite strategy that you can employ depending on whether you are bearish or bullish. However, I can't find anything on a LEAPS put strategy where you sell the puts along the way. Can anyone tell me if there's a reason for that? Am I missing something? I am bearish on a particular stock, so I was contemplating purchasing a LEAPS put for Jan 2017 and then selling puts as we go along. Am I thinking of this wrong?",1

What I don't understand is why the current market price is so far below $19/share when it is public information that the dutch auction is going off at $19/share. 

Also, why is the buyer willing to pay more than market value? The average volume is 1 million shares per day and the reit has been trading between 18-19 per share since its ipo 2 weeks ago.

* This year's location was: Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo, Guerrero. Mexico.  That's right, we went deep into the land of cartels, kidnappers murderers.  And we all made it back alive.  

* The crew: We had a people from USA, Australia, Mexico, England, Russia and even 2 people that flew 40 hours from Africa to make the trip! No excuses for people saying location was too far to attend.     

* The WSB group (me included) proved to be inept at commercial flights.  Flights were missed, flights were canceled, flights were delayed, luggage sent astray, people spent multiple nights in Mexico City as a result... In total there were 12 unsuccessful flight attempts within the group.  Lets see how good travelers insurance really is.

* We learned a powerful pavlovian lesson.  Apparently if you feed iguanas they will want more of it.   Those fuckers climbed up on chairs and tables to get more of it, spilling the tequila in the process.

* WSB knows how to party.   At least one of the people knocked back &gt;14 shots of tequila in the first hour of partying.  Stopped counting after that.  He lived to tell the story.

*  Beaches, pools, wave runners, partying, golf, fine dining, reminiscing about the years' highlights of WSB (notably #TheCall), all part of this years adventures.

In the next 5 calendar years, I expect to have small discretionary income, and increasing capital base (stock profits). I can live comfortably for the next few years on ~$30-$70k, but I'd be paying taxes on $100k++ profits per year.

My thought was: if I can write off expenses such as the dedicated computer and office, limit my personal income to a lower, controlled salary (for tax purposes), and potentially even buy shares of the company with my retirement funds (rolled into Roth, probably - but that's only advantageous if my income is kept in the lower tax brackets (including the Roth rollover).

Say (for 2015) I want my Roth conversions to stay in the 25% bracket (below $90,751)[1] . The corporation taxes will be lowered by the salary I pay myself (business expense), so the money I spend in the make-or-break early years won't be double-taxed. The Roth conversions that I invest in the corporation won't be double taxed - they aren't profit. (Any profit they generate would be, of course.)

Or, maybe the Roth conversion isn't helpful to me... I'm still trying to figure this out. It's clear that early successes could be very painful, without some sort of tax plan.

People always talk about reducing taxes, but the real goal is (or should be) increasing discretionary income after taxes. More income is more income, even at higher tax brackets. (If you aren't clear on that, go read up on the basics of US tax policies. There is never a point where earning an extra dollar yields a lower post-tax income.) So, I'd rather live on $50k for five years, and then pay 39.6% on a half-mil a year, than pay more taxes now, resulting in less working capital now, resulting in not having that half-mil a year in five years.

All of this needs careful Excel modeling, but there's no point in that if I am ignorant of some 4.01b subsection IV paragraph A that makes it illegal to do all this... or some other thing I haven't figured out yet.

I have friends interested in making business loans to me (or possibly buying shares; this is all very early-stage). Would that payment+interest be legitimately deductible as business expense?

On a more relevant front, the investment thesis for the company in question can be found here - http://www.capitolacquisition.com/investor/presentations/2015_04_01_Capitol_Lindblad_Investor_Presentation.pdf

My POV is the partial ownership share by National Geographic and what appear to be sterling financial fundamentals made this an atypical SPAC case. In earnest, this seems like a underexposed small cap opportunity to buy in at a discount with serious growth potential.

15-05-30,37t34o,Programmer looking for advice (or partner),"I have been dabbling with technology stocks for the last 5 years that I knew have some future (based on my personal technical experiences). Now, I want to use my technology skills to crowdsource what the brilliant people on the web are doing with the hundreds of sites that are out there to help noob investors (like me). So, I am in the middle of writing a little script that goes out and scrapes these sites to get advice on what to do with a certain stock (given a seed of stocks). Basically, I want something that would crowdsource and further fit to mine/our algorithm to determine what the overall best stocks to buy are (given my investing budget, timeframe, etc.) 

Some of the sites I am looking at:

* Stocktwits (for sentiment analysis)
* Stoxline
* Finviz (use dimensions such as P/E, forward P/E, etc. to assign some weight)
* Barchart
..

e.g - I already have a script that is scraping these sites:

&gt;Stock, current price, target price, site-1-rating, site-2-rating, site-3-rating

&gt;SXC,16.26,25.00,Hold,16% Sell,STRONG BUY

&gt;MIXT,7.7,10.67,Buy,100% Buy,STRONG BUY

&gt;EXPR,17.64,NA,NA,100% Buy,STRONG BUY

&gt;BBF,13.89,NA,NA,88% Sell,STRONG BUY

&gt;DVD,2.38,4.00,Hold,8% Sell,STRONG BUY

My assumption is that the smart people behind these sites have their own algorithms to rate stocks and maybe I can use this to build something that fits my/our needs. And its quite possible my assumption is completely false.. 

I am looking for some advice on where to start or partner that understands this and needs help with the programming portion.

What I get: deeper understanding of the stock market
What you get: I plan to run this program/script in the cloud daily, hourly, etc. You can get email reports (or even the source code). 

This is more of a learning experience for me, so any advice is appreciated!

EDIT:
FWIW, here is the output of the script. Runs every hour and emails the output. I plan to add more sites in the next couple of weeks to get a strong(er) indicator. Thanks for all your help!

15-05-31,37zned,My case against index investing.,"**Check this out:**
http://dqydj.net/sp-500-return-calculator/

Period | annualized return | inflation adj return | Total return (after inflation)
------|-----------------|--------------------|------------------------------
2010-2015 | 13.45% | 11.573% | 72.897%
2005-2015 | 6.022% | 3.935% | 47.095%
2000-2015 | 2.697% | 0.502% | 7.793%

1985-2015 | 8.462% | 5.632% | 417.385%
1975-2015 | 8.209% | 4.240% | 426.427%

**Observations:**

* Return from index is in no way consistent or safe.
* More than 10% return isn't achievable over the long term, due to the booms and busts in the stock market.
* Perhaps passive/ETF-based investing has been growing lately because of the high annualized return over the last 5 years.
* Over the very long term, index investing is not so lucrative (4x your investment if you began in 1975). You have to consider the opportunity cost of this investment over such a long period of time.
* Compare these figures to your favorite stocks [here](http://dqydj.net/dividend-reinvestment-calculator-for-any-stock-including-dollar-cost-averaging/): Investing $10,000 in AAPL in 2005 would have made you a profit of $229,000, investing the same amount in VRX would have made you a profit of $130,000.

I know about hindsight bias, but what I am trying to say is that if you have dedicated your time to just a single stock of a wonderful business, you're potential return would have outweighed the 'safety' of ETFs. Also, don't expect to get rich from index investing. It makes sense if you're investing a very large amount (+$1mm), so 1mm in 1975 would become 4mm in 2015. But if you've invested 10k in 1975, your investment would now be worth a measly 40k.

My advice: pretty much follow Warren Buffet/Charlie Munger's method to invest in a wonderful business at a fair price, and ignore Mr. Market especially when he's manic. **A single winner in a portfolio of less than 10 stocks can easily outperform the market index.**",0

15-05-31,37zqd8,YOLO earnings 6/2 - $VMEM,"Earnings on Tuesday. Anyone on it? Whats interesting is insider purchases. The CEO gets minimum wage and the rest of his comp in stock, yet he's been buying a ton on the open market. Similar situation with other insiders. More analysis below on why last quarter was misunderstood.

    After noodling it over and focusing on what's important, here are some thoughts.
    
    1) In a sense, their big customer moving to FSP one quarter early is irrelevant. What I know about this account I found out independently, and there is almost no chance the customer doesn't come back to buy FSP. VMEM displaced EMC VMAX there for primary storage and the customer built an application that is essentially the core of their competitive advantage on VMEM. Again, this account was spending $40mm/year on EMC VMAX before VMEM won in Q2.
    
    2) The opportunity. The big high-end disk array business is the crown jewel of the storage industry. This is dominated by EMC's VMAX franchise with other players such as IBM and Hitachi. The profit pool is many billions of dollars here. NTAP has been trying to break into the VMAX franchise forever, but has been completely unsuccessful because you need a disruptive change to put the market up for grabs again.
    
    3) The disruptive change is flash and it is here. EMC's VMAX revenues are declining 30% YoY and credit to EMC for being willing to self-cannibalize with XtremeIO. EMC mentioned recently that 66% of XtremeIO opportunities are just trying to defend a VMAX installation.
    
    4) Looking at VMEM's FSP is like looking at the first iPod and having to make a judgment call. EMC is very good at sales, so are VMEM's assets strong enough to overcome EMC's selling ability? The technical minutae isn't productive to get into here, but I think these are the key advantages VMEM can point to in a bake-off:
    
    a) Cost: 20-30% lower $/GB. And VMEM's cost curve will go down steeper and faster than SSD-based arrays[1].
    
    b) Simplicity: FSP is a completely integrated solution from flash all the way up to the operating system/data service with an unified management interface. For XtremeIO, you have to also buy VPLEX software from EMC to run it.
    
    c) Performance: Because of the architecture, VMEM has leading sustained performance whatever the mix of reads and writes. Allows customers to consolidate all applications onto FSP and not worry about performance.
    
    5) All the SSD-based arrays are going to have to make a major disruptive architectural change. SAS (the way SSDs currently connect inside a flash array) is essentially an obselete interface and the SSD vendors are moving to a new interface called NVMe. Again, the technical minutae just gets the point muddled, but this will disrupt all the SSD arrays. They will have to rebuild their systems &amp; software all over.
    
    So in summary, just as it was yesterday, the opportunity is there, VMEM has its product portfolio in order now, and they still have to fight EMC everyday. EMC has the sales advantage, VMEM has a much better product. EMC will anything to defend its VMAX franchise. In just one account, EMC lost a $40mm/year revenue stream that is almost pure profit. Would EMC or a EMC competitor pay more than VMEM's $300mm EV to defend or attack the crown jewel VMAX franchise?
    
     
    
    [1] I sometimes hear the argument that SSD-based arrays have the advantage of using commodity parts. This is entirely false. A commodity is something where each unit is a perfect substitute for every other unit. You can only use an EMC or Pure or whatever approved SSD inside their arrays. Heck, Pure reverse-engineers the particular SSD's firmware in their software.
    
    When a new NAND flash die comes out, all VMEM has to do is characterize the die and put it in their system. EMC/Pure have to wait until the SSD vendor puts the new flash ina drive, write the firmware, then EMC/Pure has to qualify the drive in their system. This is a 9-12 month advantage for VMEM, which is why their cost curve goes down faster. 

--
    When I saw the topline, I immediately knew what happened. The details on the call confirmed it. VMEM won a great account in Q2, a ""top 5 global retailer"" (easy to figure out who if you dig around). That account was their #1 customer in Q2 and Q3, to the tune of ~$4mm/qtr.
    
    VMEM expected this account to make a purchase of 6000 arrays in Q4, but once the account saw they FSP, they wanted to move to it quickly. The account is currently qualifying the FSP in their storage environment. Once qualification is done, the account will be back to a ~$4mm/qtr clip. Qualification time is uncertain, but VMEM feels confident by the end of Q2.
    
    VMEM displaced EMC for primary storage in this account in Q2 and there is a lot of headroom for recurring revenue. This customer was a $40mm/year account for EMC.
    
    The thesis is based on execution and VMEM certainly bumbled the transition of their largest customer to the new FSP. Use your judgment as to how this affects your overall view of managment's ability to execute.
    
    Nails, the old management built up a ton of inventory post-IPO. The new FSP array basically makes the existing inventory obselete. I expected the write-off this quarter. Was worried about, but did not expect the pause in buying from their largest customer.

--

    We believe an investment in VMEM is timely given the market’s misunderstanding of the company’s recent Q4 FY2015 financial results (VMEM’s fiscal year-end is in January).
    
    In Q2 and Q3 of the latest fiscal year, VMEM’s largest customer was a top-five global retailer with a recurring $4M buy.  When this customer was informed of the FSP launch, the customer decided to purchase the new FSP product – but first the retailer had to approve the FSP product via a non-industry standard 3-4 month qualification process.  As a result, this top-five global retailer did not purchase any product from Violin in Q4.
    
    When Violin reported its Q4 FY2015 results, revenues badly missed consensus expectations.  In Q2 FY2015, Kevin’s first full quarter as CEO, VMEM reported +3% sequential sales growth to $18.6M.  In Q3 FY2015, VMEM’s top-line accelerated to +17% sequential growth and $21.7M in revenues.  With the global top-five retailer’s recurring purchase delayed by a few months, VMEM’s sales went backwards in Q4 FY2015 by -6% to $20.5M.  VMEM’s shares promptly sold off -20% to a six-month low below $4 per share.
    
    In our view, the market misinterpreted the results.  Backing out the top-five retailer, VMEM’s sales to other customers actually increased +16% sequentially in front of a major product launch – indicating that VMEM continues to deliver on its turnaround and gain traction with customers.  Importantly, we believe the global top-five retailer will return to a $4M quarterly recurring buy of VMEM product no later than Q2 FY2016 as Violin’s solution underpins a mission-critical system for that retailer.  VMEM management guidance for another quarter of at least double-digit sequential top-line growth in Q1 FY2016 does not include any sales to that retailer.
    
    In short, we anticipate accelerating sales growth ahead.  With the launch of the FSP product, we forecast 20%+ sequential top-line growth in Q1 FY2016 to $24-25M.  The return of the global top-five retailer in Q2 FY2016 should provide a $4M kicker on top of continued 20%+ sequential growth to other customers, resulting in Q3 FY2016 sales of $30M+.  Our view is that top-line growth will continue to accelerate from there.",4

For now though, I realize I need to get this 10K into the market to do something for me while I'm researching and until I'm more certain on a few companies. Research tells me to just put this 10k in a Vanguard ETF such as the Russell 3000, but I've been sitting here for a couple weeks now waiting for an upturn. I might just leave this 10K in an ETF more long term, just as a safety net.

I have other money I can invest if I am more certain on a good range of stocks to buy, but if i decide I really want to pull out of the ETF and throw that 10K into my other choices, i want to do so with minimal loss, hopefully even a little gain in the short term.

15-05-30,37vnk0,Is it crazy to have the majority of your assets in P2P lending sites?,"Me: 30, ~300k in assets, no debt, earn more than my cost of living, stable profession. My time horizon for investing is pretty long: 20-30 years. I don't anticipate needing liquidity for the next 5 years.

I'm concerned that the S&amp;P seems very expensive right now (I realize the standard dogma about not trying to time the market). Would it be crazy to put, say, 80% of my assets (~250k) in 3 and 5 year loans on sites like LendingClub and Prosper? The hope would be to wait out the inevitable correction in the stock market while earning returns in the range of [0,10]% per year.

Even if/when there is a major correction in the S&amp;P, I'd guess is that it will have a relatively small impact on the default rates for consumer credit -- i.e., you'd be betting that an S&amp;P correction is more likely than the start of a full-blown recession in the rest of the economy, which seems like a bet I'd be willing to make.

I'd love to hear why this is a bad idea!",51

If you go to any stock board on any service--Yahoo, InvestorHub, Google, MotleyFool, Investor Village, you will find persons / multiIDs whose only point is to drag down a stock. Usually its easy to just ignore. We know they are out there, its no surprise. And it's obvious that some people make money when an equity goes down, but sometimes its a whole new level of aliases and bashing. It just doesn't seem possible that the majority of posts are random individuals. Sometimes the posts go up even without any other posters on the board at all, for months. Who would do that except for pay? Are there known groups or agencies that pay people to do this? Can't imagine that individuals produce this type of useless junk day after day for a decade. Put another way, is it more than noise, is it organized? Who's behind that? Can they be identified? Are they covert because of defamation lawsuit risk?

15-05-31,3804xw,"I had x$, here's what I did. Too risky?","I'm 32, the most I've ever made in a year is about 47k. I started a Roth IRA at 24. Made a few mistakes, settled by 26 at Vanguard in a target retirement fund. Presently, the balance is about 48k, but earlier this year I decided to take on re-balancing myself and exchanged my target fund for lower expenses with the following allocation of what the target fund was comprised:

65% Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (Admiral)
27% Vanguard International Stock Market Index (Admiral)
8% Vanguard Total Bond Market Index (Investor)
(The allocation from the target fund for international bond was too small for minimum balance of 3k so left it out.)

This move was already more aggressive than the target fund, which had allocated 10% to bonds, but then I got to thinking, I've got 30 years+ til retirement (if that ever actually happens anyway) what the heck are these bonds going to do for me? I've got the time to weather volatility, why hamstring my growth? So I exchanged them, along with some of my Total Stock and International Stock indexes to qualify for Admiral shares of Vanguard Small-Cap Value Index.

Now I have no bonds, just 100% stock indexes:
55% Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (Admiral)
25% Vanguard International Stock Marked Index (Admiral)
20% Vanguard Small-Cap Value Index (Admiral)

I did not consider anything like an REIT fund because my house exposes me to that enough. I am a public employee and have a meager pension at this point as I finish my 9th year as a teacher. I am married with a 10 month old. My wife stays home, though she has a 30k 403b from her old employer. It is mostly in Vanguard funds as well. We have no debt but our home, but that's only because we refinanced our home, which was 1/2 paid off, to roll 30k of student loan debt into it. It's a 15 yr mtg and we still owe 80k at 3.5% fixed. We have an emergency fund of 5k, but 6mo expenses are closer to 11k. It is my intention to think of this Roth account as both a retirement account and a college savings account, from which we can pull contributions penalty free, if needed.

Am I being irresponsible with my investments? We have a pretty high threshold for risk tolerance, because in some ways we don't really trust it or my pension will be there for us by then anyway, but this isn't that risky right? I mean, the only reason we'd lose it all is if the entire financial system collapsed, at which point this account would be of little concern...or that's my thinking at least. Let me have it!

I've been 'following' this stock for a short while and think it's got potential for the future. In late March the stock experienced a jump in price from around 45-50 to 68, which then sunk back down and now seems stable at this level around 60p.

In March they released mostly good news for their second half - for example revenue 57% higher, EDITDA up 243% but some bad news like the quality at some of their operations dropping. Plenty of cash. Analyst forecasts mostly positive, and targets mostly between 77 and 90p.

Here's a chart of the last 3 months

I'm just trying to understand the jump and fall in price here - this isn't the most liquid stock, it's AIM listed, pretty low daily volume (though that also spiked significantly around the period in question).

Is this what a pump and dump looks like? Or is this just what price discovery looks like in this type (lower volume, AIM) of stock?

American Cryostem Corp. (CRYO) Other OTC Recent price $.30
Twelve month closing price range $.20-$.80

CRYO has a clinical cGMP tissue processing and bio-banking facility in Mt. Laural NJ that is licenses in all 50 states. They are FDA registered, ICCBBA registered and have approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the International Cell Surgical Society). They collect cells, store cells (cryogenic), process and purify cells, and provide cells for patient treatment. The company has 15 patents and numerous copy write protected trademarks. They are in active research partnerships with Rutgers University, the University of Miami, University of Pittsburgh and the University of Washington.


Stem cells; the basis of life.  From Wikipedia: “Stem cells are undifferentiated biological cells that can differentiate into specialized cells and can divide (through mitosis) to produce more stem cells. They are found in multicellular organisms. In mammals, there are two broad types of stem cells: embryonic stem cells, which are isolated from the inner cell mass of blastocysts, and adult stem cells, which are found in various tissues. In adult organisms, stem cells and progenitor cells act as a repair system for the body, replenishing adult tissues. There are three known accessible sources of autologous adult stem cells in humans:
1	Bone marrow, which requires extraction by harvesting, that is, drilling into bone (typically the femur or iliac crest).
2	Adipose tissue (lipid cells), which requires extraction by liposuction.
3	Blood, which requires extraction through apheresis, wherein blood is drawn from the donor (similar to a blood donation), and passed through a machine that extracts the stem cells and returns other portions of the blood to the donor.”

CRYO use adipose cells, which it gets through belly fat. As the name suggests, it cryogenically freezes the cells for future use. On the companies board is Dr. Dayong Gao, who is one of the world’s top authorities on cryogenic cells. Cells can be frozen and still viable for over 50 years. Potential Sources of Income: CRYO is a complicated story with lots of areas of opportunity. There are numerous was for it to make money, both near term and long term.

1.	Medium sales
2.	Medical applications
3.	Cosmetic applications
4.	Fat storage for future use
5.	Licensing worldwide partners

Licensing Partners.  While not the largest long term opportunity, it is the most immediate source of revenue. It can bring in a million dollars of revenue, with little cost, this year.

Stem cell research has been going on for many years. There are numerous laboratories around the world that have focused on cord blood stem cells (from embryonic cord blood) rather than adipose cells. Cord blood cells have not proved to be as effective as expected for numerous reasons and there are multi million dollar laboratories that are not being used effectively. These laboratories have about 80% of the equipment that is needed to run a lab the way CRYO does. CRYO just completed selling a license to a lab in Hong Kong for $150,000 plus a future royalty stream of 15% of revenue with a minimum of $10,000 per month. There about a dozen more locations worldwide that want licenses and the company is confident that they will sell 6 more this year generating $900, 000 in immediate revenue. The labs will have to buy their collection kits from CRYO, and pay a royalty of revenue, creating a continuous future revenue stream.

Medium Sales. 

The commonly used medium for stem cell reproduction is Fetal Bovine Serum. From Wikipedia: “Fetal bovine serum (FBS) or fetal calf serum is the blood fraction remaining after the natural coagulation of blood, followed by centrifugation to remove any remaining red blood cells. Fetal bovine serum comes from the blood drawn from a bovine fetus via a closed system of collection at the slaughterhouse. Fetal bovine serum is the most widely used serum-supplement for the in vitro cell culture of eukaryotic cells. This is due to it having a very low level of antibodies and containing more growth factors, allowing for versatility in many different cell culture applications. The globular protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), is a major component of fetal bovine serum. The rich variety of proteins in fetal bovine serum maintains cultured cells in a medium in which they can survive, grow, and divide.”

The senior management of CRYO did not come from a medical/scientific background, but instead came from a financial background. Because of this they look at problems and opportunities different. The one thing that both industries have in common is a high degree of government regulation. Owning a licensed security company you have to jump through hoops for the SEC and in medical research you jump through hoops for the FDA. 

Looking forward, management asked the question “how long before the FDA says you can not put human cells, grown in a medium comprised of cow blood, back into a human being”? Since no one told them it was not possible, then engaged on the long process of developing a medium to grow cell cultures that was based on using parts of human blood rather than parts of bovine blood. 

Working with scientists at nearby Rutgers University they have developed a medium that is producing cell lines so pure that the output is twenty times what anyone else has achieved. CRYO and Rutgers jointly own the patents on this medium.  This medium has been used at several other research universities around the country with great results. The market for medium is about $3 billion per year in the US alone. CRYO however has been so tight on capital that they have not yet pursued that market. They have been in discussions with Johnson and Johnson as well as Merck for license the technology. 

Medical Applications.  There are many. Four different universities are doing studies in four different areas right now. Any one of these could be worth a billion dollars. Or they could all fail. So lets focus on what is happening right now. Multiple sclerosis.  There is no cure for MS. Knowing that, anything that can improve the quality of life for an MS sufferer will be very valuable. CRYO has a license for medical tourism granted by the government of the Cayman Islands. They have partnered there with the DaVinci Centre and treated their first patient for MS. They have not announced this nor do they want to publically talk about this. They told the patient not to talk about this. The patient however has talked about it.

The patient has a blog called “MS Fitness Challenge” on Facebook. https://www.facebook.com/msfitnesschallenge 
On November 9, 2014 he wrote “Getting ready to leave this paradise of an island today. American Cryostem along with the DaVinci Centre in the Cayman Islands has completed the most extensive MS treatment available. First my body was prepared for the treatment while my stem cells were multiplied in a FDA approved lab. At the center I underwent therapies performed by the most qualified practitioners in their fields. And my purified stem cells were put back into my body by the doctor with no pain or discomfort. When I boarded the plane to this country I had no idea what was in store but I knew that my MS was progressing and no MS meds or ""normal"" MS protocol here in the US was effectively stopping this disease. I made a choice to research alternative, holistic means to battle MS and found American Cryostem which is a publicly traded company (CRYO). I was shocked at the extent this company has gone to provide the top stem cell therapy in the world. And, working hand in hand, we went forward with the DaVinci Centre protocol. I don't know what the future holds because it will take some time before my stem cells find their place in my body to repair my nervous system BUT I do know that last night I walked effortlessly to a restaurant a half mile from my hotel AND I can open and close my left hand like new after 8 years of being stiff and immobile from MS. Small victories for some but life changing for me.” 

On January 30, 2015 he posted two pictures and wrote “Here I am side by side MYSELF to show how well I am doing as I train for the Arnold Classic in March. Left photo was first week of Nov 2014 in the Caymans while getting stem cell treatment from American Cryostem at the Davinci Centre. Right photo a week ago after less than 3 months. Bigger, leaner and stronger thanks to my own body's stem cells!!”  He had done a lot of weight training and his biceps were two and a half inches bigger. (on a 58 year old man with MS)

CRYO has not talked about this case and they cannot talk publically about it until after the patient goes through a 90-day checkup with a very specific FDA protocol the 90 days will be up February 9, 2015.

The doctor in the Cayman had treated a couple of people with MS using other company’s stem cells prior. They both had negative reactions and he was reluctant to try again. After researching what the reactions were it could all be traced back possible side effects based on using fetal bovine serum. Using fetal bovine serum and cord blood stem cells the harvested stem cells are very impure. Using adipose cells and the CRYO medium, after refinement the cells are 20 times more pure. The dose others have used from the traditional method is 5 million cells. The CRYO approach produces 100 million cells. 

There were several locations in the US attempting similar treatment for MS patients. In December 2014 the FDA issued a directive that shut them all down. Their backlogs of patient are now looking for a place to go for this treatment. 

The price CRYO charges for this service in the Caymans is $35,000. Even with no publicity other than the MS Fitness Challenge there is already of backlog of patients seeking treatment.

Cosmetic Surgery. Cosmetic surgery is one of the most profitable areas of medicine. While most doctors focus on medical side of the business, Cosmetic Surgeons tend to be much more knowledgeable about the business side of the business. 

Botox has been around long enough that most everyone has heard of it. Again, from Wikipedia: “on April 12, 2002, the FDA announced regulatory approval of botulinum toxin type A (Botox Cosmetic) to temporarily improve the appearance of moderate-to-severe frown lines between the eyebrows (glabellar lines). Subsequently, cosmetic use of botulinum toxin type A has become widespread. The results of Botox Cosmetic can last up to four months and may vary with each patient. 
The global Botox market is forecast to reach $2.9 billion by 2018.The entire global market for facial aesthetics is forecast to reach $4.7 billion in 2018, of which the US is expected to contribute over $2 billion.”

The problem with Botox from the consumer side is it only lasts four months and you have to do it again. This is great for the surgeon as it is creating a repeat business. Unfortunately consumers are price conscious. If it costs $300 the first time and four months later another doctor advertises the same treatment for $275, the patient moves there.

CRYO gets their adipose stem cells from fatty tissue, in particular they use belly fat. Some cosmetic surgeons are using the patient’s own fatty tissue rather than Botox to remove wrinkles. The problem with that is some of the fatty tissue dies off. Then a few months later the patient comes back to go through the somewhat painful process of fat removal again. The approach that CRYO uses is to freeze the fat for the patient so that it can be used again and again without having to remove it each time. The doctor loves it because the patient will only come back to their office because they control the tissue. CRYO charges $400 initially plus an annual $200 storage fee. Due to lack of capital they have done very little marketing but they have been getting about three to five patients per week. With marketing that should quickly grow to over 20 per week near term and could easily be over 100 a week in the next year or two. 

Cosmetics  American Cryostem was founded in 2008 to do stem cell research primarily for the cosmetic industry. Stem cells are the basis for life. They cause our cells to regenerate and are considered by many to be the fountain of youth. While the company today is doing research with several different universities medical departments and the National Institute of Health (NIH) on MS, Cancer and other life threatening diseases, it was founded to be a player in the highly profitable arena of anti-aging cosmetics. 

Founded by two Wall Street veterans, John Arnone and Anthony Bozinski, with goal of big profits in custom cosmetics. The original idea was to take a person’s stem cells, purify and reproduce them, add them to a locally applied cosmetic to rejuvenate the skin. Wrinkles would reduce or disappear and the person looked younger. It worked. Articles were written in Vogue and other magazines and the coverage was great. There was one major problem; the price for the custom cosmetic was $1,200. Very few people would pay it when Botox was priced at $300. 

The product is not dead, just in the redesign phase. Everyone in the cosmetic industry will tell you that stem cells represent the biggest potential growth factor in the industry. It will be worth billions when it finally perfected and brought to market.  

Rather than using your own stem cells for $1,200 the company can create a stem cell product based on demographics. Their licensee in Hong Kong is organizing a beauty pageant for the “Most Beautiful Skin” in Hong Kong. The prize is the $1,200 custom cosmetic for free but with it winner signs away the rights to her stem cells. The company then mass reproduces them. That is then mixed with a low priced cosmetic and sold as a low priced ($50-$75) stem cell enhanced anti aging skin cream. Different demographics will need different cell lines. 

This is not a near term revenue stream but long term could be potentially gigantic. The company is in discussion with several major cosmetic companies to license and fund these opportunities.

Risk Analysis:  The two biggest risk factors are do they have a large potential revenue stream and do they have the capital to survive until then? The answer to the first is absolutely yes (as described above) the second part is the biggest risk.

In doing proper risk analysis there are two very important components; the probability of an event happening and consequence of that event happening. The biggest risk here is the company running out of cash. The probability of that happening is very small. The reason that I say that is the company has survived through six years with no revenue at all. It was founded by two Wall Street people with no medical background during the worst recession in the last 75 years. During that time Obamacare went from an idea, to an unknown, to a reality. All during this time the company had no revenue and constantly had to raise cash. Now the economy is much better, Obamacare, while bad, is defined, and the company is generating revenue and should be cash flow breakeven this year. Based on their proven ability to raise capital in a bad market environment, now that the market is better and the company is generating revenue, they should be able to continue to successfully raise capital. 

While the risk of running out of cash is low, the consequence of running out cash is catastrophic. They cannot survive if they don’t raise enough money to operate until cash flow breakeven, which is about 10-12 months away. Based on the current burn rate of $90k a month, they need to raise $1 million this year. The weighted risk factor is therefore based on a low probability but also a high consequence, which means as an investor you don’t risk more than you can afford to lose. 


Conclusion:  If this was a private company the valuation, based on comparisons, it should be in the range of $300 million to $500 million. Because it is public, the valuation is the market cap. Fully diluted there are 42 million shares outstanding. At $.30 the market cap is in the $12 million range. Within three to five years the market cap should be $300 million to $500 million making the expected price of this stock $10 per share.

15-05-31,37ybkt,Is pouring money in index funds after a hypothetical market crash as effective as pouring it into blue chip stocks.,"Hi, sorry to bring up market crashes again. 

Imagine that you have a 30 percent crash. It might keep going down, but I'd consider it a great moment to put as much cash into stocks/related as possible. 
My question is: Would I benefit as much from pouring into index funds as I would if I bought the now cheap blue chip stocks?",42

That's the case I deal with anyway.  But does it make sense to purchase equities with a private bank when the fees are 1.25% for $0-$25,000; 1% for $25,000–$100,000; 0.75% for $100,000 to $150,000; and 0.50% for $500,000?  

Would appreciate some objective feedback on the above and, more generally, on why being with a private bank might be beneficial.  They are pretty selective with who they accept as clients, so I am wondering what the big pay-off is (in addition to the queries above).",48
15-05-31,37ytum,"$45,000 to invest but undecided on options","So I'm enlisted in the Army and all my bills are in check, I have $45k at my disposal to invest with $5k backup for emergencies.

15-05-31,37z11f,Looking to understand what happened in the last year,"So after I got back from my year abroad last July, I started reading about stocks since I had wanted to for a pretty long time. I read again and again to be prepared to lose money and get it wrong for a fair amount of time before I could start understanding how markets and economies work.

So I made a virtual portfolio on Google finance and picked some companies, out of the ones I knew reasonably well, that I thought would go up in price. They all went down at first, but I kept watching and now all of them but one are at +30%+ of the price they were when I started watching. Which makes me wonder really if it isn't just a question of global economy more than anything else, and if they won't all go down very soon as lots of recent articles are talking about a ""bubble burst"" in the near future. 

Is it wrong to think that? Did all the companies I chose do so well to gain more than a third of their stock value in less than a year, or is it the economic context that made it possible? ",1
