15-06-01,380s5y,Planning on getting a long-term Index ETF. I have no idea what to do. Any tips appreciated.,,6
15-06-01,380to1,Such a gap between Fidelity (FSGUX) and Vanguard (VGTSX) global index funds --- can anyone share insight as to why? (VG vs FD 3-fund considerations),"I've changed jobs recently, so I have a 7 year old 401k w/ Fidelity I'm considering rolling over into an IRA (new company is a startup with no 401k). When I started working, my idea of diversification in regard to funds was ""10 sounds like a good number - some large, medium, and small"" and I based it mostly off of the primary companies in them. Yeah, not very scientific, and yeah the fees I've encountered are certainly something I want to get away from.

Anyway, I'm looking to correct my mistakes (as well as fees) with a typical Boglehead style 3-fund setup and for the most part my expectations were that while Vanguard was generally favored for this, you could build similar setups with Fidelity funds as well.

The total market and bond funds tracked so similarly, but there was a huge difference between Vanguard and Fidelity for the global funds. Is there a significant philosophical difference between the two that would lead to such a disparity? My concern is whether something about Fidelity's indexes don't lend themselves to this setup as much as expected and I would be shooting myself in the foot long term.

https://www.fidelity.com/fund-screener/compare.shtml#!&amp;fIds=FSTVX%2CFSTMX%2CVTSMX%2CVGTSX%2CFSGUX

I have a Roth IRA through Fidelity as well, using their Freedom target-date funds, so my hope was that I could keep my rollover with them as opposed to jumping through all the hoops to move to Vanguard (not to mention I liked the idea of getting their Amex rewards card w/ 2% into your accounts).

Apologies if this comes off as really remedial, I'm only just trying to wrap my head around how to really manage this correctly (as well as consider a taxable account, as I've got enough cash sitting around and I don't plan on buying property I'd like to do something with it). I was considering something like Betterment or Wealthfront, but it seemed that the amount of work required to avoid their extra fees was not significant enough to give up that dough.",7

15-06-01,3812e0,"Thoughts on Betterment's portfolio for 100% stocks for 24 y/o?","* › US Total Stock Market: VTI 17.8%
* › US Large-Cap Value: VTV 17.9%
* › US Mid-Cap Value: VOE 5.7%
* › US Small-Cap Value: VBR 5.0%
* › Developed Markets: VEA 40.8%
* › Emerging Markets: VWO 12.7%

I feel like this portfolio is kind of odd. Specifically VEA at 40.8%. Seems a bit high... Why not VTI and VTV to be higher?

Also VEA has historically performed pretty poorly.

What about the other funds? Do you guys think this is a worthwhile portfolio, or should I do my research and design my own?",56

15-06-01,380zq6,"2 Trading Additions You Can't Miss","After taking a week off analyzing my new addition to my strategy (and also I had a lot of things to do outside of trading). I thought I would talk about what I have analyzed and what I have been doing. 

**First off one thing I was doing was this:**

http://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/36e3pf/whats_going_on_peeps/crd5sfd

&gt;For fun I created a bunch of finviz scans and I am taking each stock to see how they do. My goal is to find a finviz that profits from swingtrades. Each stock (on the scan) for a day and see how they do. I am not doing it with real money, just testing. I will report how they do in a week or so somewhere on this subreddit.
Btw they are all shorting



However, it wasn't consistent..... at all. You were either gaining 10% in a day or losing 10%. I also tried 2 more that were just terrible. I am not even going to bother posting them here. Basically what I have learned is that you still need to be aware of what you are trading versus just relying on a few technicals to short a stock. Wouldn't recommend ever trying this ""finviz strategy"".

After a few days of tests, I found the most sucessful watchlist is this (for shorting): http://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=211&amp;f=sh_avgvol_o300,sh_price_u20,ta_highlow20d_nh,ta_perf_d5o,ta_rsi_ob60

-
Another thing I have been trying out is the EMA lines. Not something I have actually considered in the past, but I thought I would give it a shot. Something I struggled with was my entries, literally I would get scared out of a trade just because my entry was bad. Luckily, from what I have seen, the EMA lines appear to help it. **I use 9EMA on the 5 minute chart.** I still stick to my main strategy, but while using my new addition.

15-06-01,384esl,"Market may be mispricing Netflix's July IV","#**Background:**

Something we've been discussing on /r/options is the Netflix Q2 earnings. It will be released sometime in July. If we google earnings date estimates, we get a few different answers:
----


| Source       |       Estimate | 
|:------------:|:--------------:|
|EarningsWhisper|7/15/15|
|YahooFinance| 7/20-24|
|StreetInsider| 7/21/15|

Meanwhile, *July Expiry is 7/17/15.* So, some people think expiry is before earnings, some think it's after. If we have an opinion, we can trade this.

As an addition, here are their past July earnings dates:

| Date Released       |       Day of Month | 
|:------------:|:--------------:|
|7/21/14 | 3rd Monday of July|
|7/22/13 | 4th Monday of July|
|7/24/12 | 4th Tuesday of July|
|7/25/11 | 4th Monday of July|

So, it seems like past earnings have been released on 3rd-4th Monday-Tuesday, which lines up to 7/20/15 of this year. Now [take a look at Jul vs Aug Implied Volatility](http://i.imgur.com/6l75ajA.png). July and Aug are trading at 42 and 38. If earnings actually happens after Jul expiry, then the market is overpricing Jul vol.
----
----------

#**The Trade:**

Sell July vol and buy Aug vol. There are a few ways to structure the trade, here are two:


1. Short JUL Straddle, Buy AUG Straddle. 
2. Short JUL Strangle, Buy AUG Strangle (same strikes).

If you want to go for a pure play on implied volatility, maybe run straddles. You'll get better vega, and Jul implied should drop before the end of Jun. 

If you want the front month to expire worthless and have an almost-free long strangle over their earnings, take the strangle.

Be warned: considering that April's earnings was released a week earlier than usual, this could mean I'm a fool.

AMBA is looking way overextended and I wish I had gone long a few weeks ago. I made really good plays last ER, but the setup is completely different this time.

Edit : Evolent Health

Just went to the IPO roadshow event for these guys and was super impressed. They start trading Friday. They are a consulting / software company that helps hospitals move from a pay per service structure to a pay per performance model.  Not to get too detailed but some HC experts see this as the way of the future to fix our broken HC system in America.  It effectively provides a fixed rate by the insurance company or the hospital becomes the insurer to incentivize themselves to not overtreat / keep their costs under control.  Anyways, these guys have 10 contracts in place with major hospital networks and I'm assuming its only a matter of time until they sign more.  They get paid on a per member per month model and will receive anywhere from 100-300 bucks/year (depending on the plan) per life on board their platform.  I'd suspect this number will be over 2+ mil by the end of 2017 and they will do close to $300 mil in sales... 

Anyways,  I'd be willing to pay up to $20 a share for this and think it could go as high as $25 in the first couple of weeks.  May not be available through some brokers but I thought it was worth mentioning.  This thing could be an absolute monster over the next 5 years.

This stock cratered like hell when a toxic financer dumped all their shares over a short period last year. A lot of people jumped in for multibag gains on the bounce and it slowly faded after an r/s. The chart tells the tale.

**Catalysts:** Labstyle has some presentation at the 75th annual diabetes something something this month. The bigger deal is the possible FDA approval of the Dario. It's already been approved by Health Canada and a number of Western countries.

It's important to note that sales in Australia et al didn't really begin until after the last 10-k was filed so who knows how it's selling.

**The gamble:** FDA approves the Dario this month and the stock could jump a couple bucks in a few days. It's around .34 today. The downside is that the FDA could respond with questions or clarification instead of an approval, in which case the stock could drop to .10 cents.

As usual with these biotechs, they want to uplist and may r/s to try if the FDA approval doesn't get the price where they want it.

**Full disclosure:** I got a hundred percent gains on it at the last crash, fell in like with the ticker and got back in and was caught in the r/s and joined #baglife. I never sold though because I didn't see the point taking the loss if it could turn into a double bagger for me. My break even is around .75

I'm a 32yo, stable employed software engineer with a lump sum of over 100000€ to invest and the ability to save 2000€ per month (or more, as I have a frugal mindset). I've been lurking in r/investing, r/personalfinance and r/financialindepence since a couple of months and am up-to-date with the whole broad index ETF investing idea. I activated an account with a broker that offers free ETF transactions on a large part of its ETF offerings (most of Vanguard, iShares, ...), provided maximum one trade per month is executed per ETF. I'm having trouble pulling the trigger due to some doubts though:
- With markets soaring at an all-time high, as well as May-November being a statistically bad time, would it be more prudent to dollar-cost-average my way in, rather than investing my savings in a lump sum and risking years of delay on returns? Or go in half and keep the other half to invest post-correction/crash? I know the general consensus is to not time the market, but looking at index charts, the way to the bottom usually seems very slow.
- Are there overviews/charts available that price in reinvested dividends?
- Is there any point to holding a bonds fund over my 0.8% yielding savings account?

I haven't been here long, but im loving this sub. Ive noticed a lot we have a vast skill gap between newbs trading pennys and others trading complex options spreads. It seems like its hard to tell a lot of times on the trolls and the really bad ideas. Also, people with consistant good picks arent getting any credit, and others claiming they made a pick after a stock is up 50%. Hope to solve some of that, but also,


This is wallstreet BETS. I think we need a betting system. 


So, i started making a bot, and quickly realized i have too many ways to take it, so I wanted to get the potential users opinoin:


**Option 1:** Would basically be a virtual portfolio, you would message the bot after posting your DD with your trade details. And then post again to close...add to the position etc. Would hope to add some type of BS checker to check against market data to prevent people saying they sold AMD for $100. I started this option, but now think I like option 2 better.

**Option 2:** More of a bets bot. You would basically message the bot in public (or private) after posting your DD and say something like ""I bet AMD is $4.00 by 6/15/2015"". The bot would then go grab the current price, and check again each day until your target date. It would record info like max loss at anytime, if it crosses your target etc. Looking for ideas.

With either option I would add features where you could check other peoples stats, current bets/positions etc. Depending on how much people like it/approval from the mods I could have it reply in comments etc, but I hate bots that generate spam.

What do you guys think? Or am I wasting my time?

15-06-02,3868gc,Value investing and buy and hold.,"I wanted an alternative way of measuring my portfolio performance, because as a buy and hold value investor, I wanted to make sure I was staying on track. So what I did tonight was break down and measure my portfolio returns by year to the present time. As you can see from the numbers below the investments I made in the year 2007 have returned 627% to date, the investments I made  in the year 2008 have returned 710% to date, and so on. 

I have found it harder and harder to find undervalued stocks as the bull market has run, and that was to be expected. What I did want to demonstrate to people who have not tried value investing or buy and hold investing is that it can work and is worth researching and learning, and to show it is possible to outperform the market consistently. There is life beyond index investing, but if you do pick individual stocks I feel value investing offers the best chance of success.

What I find is that the returns are usually flat for a year or two after purchase before the investments start rising in value, which is why I don’t get alarmed by the returns from purchases made from 2014 to present. 

Any time you do outperform the market, you do get the charge that you took unnecessary risks or are just lucky, but if that were true it would mean I was consistently lucky year after year. Possible, but statistically harder. 

I never tried to actually beat the market, my primary focus was not losing money and margin of safety, and increasing the value of the portfolio. I didn’t pay any attention to the performance of the market or how I performed against it. 

I don’t know if we are headed for a correction or not, but I would certainly welcome one. If stocks continue to rise, I will make more money, but I will make considerable more money from any large corrections or bear markets over the long run. 

This is not the traditional way to measure portfolio performance, but hopefully it is still illuminating and demonstrates how taking a long term view when investing can be successful.

2007 to Present - 627%

2008 to Present - 710%

2009 to Present - 351%

2010 to Present - 240%

2011 to Present - 171%

15-06-02,385jij,"Margin requirements at Interactive Brokers, A Little Confused","I spoke with about 3 interactive broker reps today about switch to IBKR, but the guys over there seem very clueless so I'm hoping someone here knows the answer. Here's the questions:


&amp;nbsp;


1) Let's say I have an account with $160,000 in U.S. stock securities and $0 cash. No margin. I decide to purchase another $80,000 on margin. My gross portfolio value is now $240,000. IBKR says it has a 25% maintenance margin. Under this scenario, how much does my portfolio need to drop (in terms of dollars and percentages) for a margin call/liquidation to trigger?


&amp;nbsp;


2) If instead in the above scenario, I borrow $90,000 on margin to buy U.S. stocks instead of $80,000, how much can the gross value of my portfolio drop before I am forced to liquidate?


&amp;nbsp;


3) Does IBKR pay ACAT transfer fees from my outgoing brokerage (I know lots of brokerages do this)?

4) Does IBKR run any promotions, especially for account holders with large values?",1
15-06-01,385f74,Proposal: A WSB Bot,"I've got to run out the door here in a few minutes, but I figured now's a good time to spark discussion around a WSB specific bot.

**Why**

Would be interesting to track:

- Who's hopped in / out of various community picks, when, and at what price
- Which tickers were posted over a timeline, tracking their %gain/loss to date from the post

Add some transparency / self-reported robustness (does that even exist?)

- Pick posters can declare their position
- Pick posters can announce when they've closed their position

Granted, it's self-reported, so someone actually doing a pump-and-dump could easily manipulate the system; but, it would still be interesting.

Additionally, with the above info, we could track / rank user-specific gains/losses based on posts. Though, no one obviously posts all of their moves to WSB, it could be interesting and encourage people to disclose more of their positions.

Also, why not?

**Ideas for Spec (super rough)**

/u/wsbot !in AAPL now call-spread: -10@135.00@10.00@06/19/2015; +130.00@20.00@06/19/2015

/u/wsbot !in AAPL 05/28/15@05:25EST stock: +300@132.23

15-06-02,385s7l,Margin Vs. Leveraged ETF,"Obligatory 'Margin/Leveraging is very risky' preface which I understand.


I'm trying to evaluate the differences between different leveraging strategies for 20-year buy-and-hold investing where I'm betting for a 8-12% market return. I'm trying to find facts to settle a debate between myself and another investor about the trade-offs between the using margin and leveraged ETFs.


Let's compare:

* A 4% margin rate, but assume that we can tax deduct it at a 50% marginal tax rate, for an effective 2% margin rate. You buy 100K using cash, 100k on margin at effective 2% margin rate. You're paying 0.1% MER on 200k and 2% on 100k costing you $2.2k in fees.
in fees.

* vs a 100K investment in SSO (ProShares Ultra S&amp;P500 2x Daily Leveraged ETF) with a 0.8% MER. Which means it cost you $0.8K in fees.


From my research it seems that the ETF can achieve lower fees because they are borrowing at a much lower rate then what is typically offered at discount brokerage (~4% for me).


Now I'm trying to come up with a concrete argument for which one is better. It looks like the leveraged ETFs is a better option for leverage than using margin because it has significantly lower fees. However there's the re-balancing 'drag' which I don't fully understand the implications of. I was under the impression that the re-balancing caused a continuous lost of equity over time but it looks like it's just adjusting the exposure daily which in some case will yield a better or worse return but not necessarily always worse than a margin investment, just different? The re-balancing means that there isn't the worry of dealing with margin calls like there is with margin accounts. I can't find anything explaining a continuous drag like I've seen suggested in some articles. The drag/re-balancing may work to your advantage. I am missing something?

15-06-02,386zag,5 Tips For Landlords,"Everyone knows that property is one of the most popular forms of investment. Unlike shares, bonds, trusts etc. property has an extra safety-net in that people will always need somewhere to live. That said, this by no means guarantees that any property investment is a good one. House prices fluctuate, as do the rental returns – not to mention the fact that mortgage interest rates are also variable.
All things considered, property remains high on the list of possible investments for many and perhaps one of the biggest factors in making the investment a success is – THE TENANTS! Here are five tips for potential buy to let property investors:
 
Always Use a Contract
When you are first setting out in the property investment world, it can be tempting to cut corners to save a few pounds. Furthermore, you may already have possible tenants in mind; friends, family or even work colleagues. I previously lived with another couple back at University in my friends house and things actually got pretty ugly when it was time to leave. The other couple had informally agreed to live there for 6 months and wanted to leave after 4. There was no contract in place between ‘friends’ and as a consequence the friendship was no more – Don’t mix business with pleasure if possible.
Others will try and wrangle their way out of contracts on technicalities. In the UK a number of ‘standard’ contracts exist, so you won’t have to pay a lawyer to write one from scratch and solicitor’s rates can actually be pretty reasonable. If you want to save more money, you can actually download one of the tenancy agreements online and edit it yourself – although it might be an idea to have a lawyer check it over.
 
Get the Mortgage Overpayments Right
When you are investing in property, it can be tempting to get too carried away with the numbers. While paying of your mortgage(s) early is a great idea in principle, ensure that you don’t set yourself up for a fall. Reduced term mortgaged (15 years instead of 25 years for example) are very popular, but can also get you into deep water if the interest rates rise or your property goes through a period of being empty. Check with your mortgage provider, but you can often make overpayments within a given limit (usually 10% of the balance) without paying a penalty. This way, you can take a 25 year mortgage and overpay as and when you can afford to – you are not obligated to meet the higher monthly repayments.
 
Have a Contingency Fund
Unlike with stock and shares, an investment in property often requires ‘topping up’ to ensure that it continues to provide a sizable return. Curtains, carpets, walls, furniture, gardens etc. all need repairing and fixing at some point. Many landlords will charge tenants from their security deposit if they are directly responsible for the breakage of something, but soft furnishings all get tired with time. It might be a good idea to keep a ‘spares and repairs account‘ for the unexpected replacement of an appliance or to help you pay the mortgage if there is a gap between tenants.
 
Use an Agency or Do It Yourself?
The temptation when buying property as an investment is to think that you can manage it all by yourself. As your empire starts to grow, the demand on your time will also increase. Agencies charge a small fee, but can take care of many of the tedious tracks in the process. You don’t want a criminal or somebody who was evicted for trashing their last flat moving right into yours do you? Agencies can provide background checks for a fee – which you can usually pass on to the tenants and also take care of any midnight call-outs – not to mention finding the tenants in the first place!
 
Ensure That You are Insured
While this might seem blatantly obvious, it is by far the most important consideration of the lot. In my five years experience of being a student, I know of at least two groups of people who caused a fire and had to move out while the fire damage was repaired. Taking the toaster into your bedroom when you are blitzed may seem like a good idea at the time; but bed covers and heating elements don’t go well together! Many specialist companies like CIA Insurance can offer policies and advice to ensure that you have the right level of cover. The last thing that any property investor wants is to owe the bank a mortgage for a property that was destroyed. Fire is not the only force that can be of detriment to your rental – flooding, mold or disastrous tenants can all cause your property value to plummet!

15-06-02,386lre,Top 5 VALUE stocks you should be buying and holding (6/2/15),"These five companies should be bought with the intentions of holding them for no fewer than 2 years or no less than 50% ror, which ever comes first. If you have the option, it is strongly advisable to turn ""dividend reinvest"" on for those US domiciled companies mentioned. 

Please note that these are value companies... That means that one considering buying any of these names should keep in mind that these companies have not performed well relative to the market.... Their stock prices are down, out of favor, and will more than likely have crappy news out about it... People will tell you to buy ""hot"" stocks that have already done well, and have already made people a lot of money... Please note that value investing seems to be counter intuitive to most, but is the best way to invest your money long term.

1. Alibaba (BABA) 
down 3% since going public... One of the world's most robust e-commerce &amp; online market places, currently 26% profit margins, and the Chinese government continues to inject their economy with stimulus while we have seen the Yuan weaken vs. the US dollar... This data should have a very positive effect on baba...

2. BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust (BPT)
 a play on weak oil prices... Can buy this stock at a 28% discount to where it was a year ago... A good way to invest in energy while its down, while getting a 13.3% dividend yield while you wait for the stock to recover. Also doesn't hurt that were entering the summer months where oil prices have a tendency to move higher (though not always) during these months...

3. Mosaic (MOS) or Potash (POT)
 Either one will work... low debt, strong profit margins, growing demand, decent dividends, a rapidly growing middle-class in 2 of the world's most populated countries where more food will be demanded more and more each year, and finally some resolution from Russia's Uralkaliy signaling to North &amp; South America that they no longer have the intentions of flooding the world markets or potash.... Prices/margins should remain strong for Mos/Pot

4. Cameco (CCJ)
    strong play on weakening Canadian dollar- Increase in global demand for uranium (including believe it or not the US and Japan)
Stock down 25% over the past 12 months with the Uranium industry tepid &amp; consolidating... Should give CCJ an advantage once we see Uranium prices adjust higher...

5. FireEye (FEYE)
  this stock has performed much better than the above 4 companies mentioned, however still looks really cheap.
The demand for cyber-security is imminent with corporations as well as governments... Cyber-security (in my opinion) will one day soon be mandated by the government as well as the insurance companies for businesses/non-profits/municipalities/ etc... This industry will turn into a expense almost the same way we look at paying a monthly electric bill, and if I am even remotely right, the sky's the limit.
FireEye seems to be best-in-class.... They are a ""virtual machine-based"" security platform which seems to be way more advanced than a software based firewall....  ",0

15-06-02,387jly,Expanding my knowledge. Need help!,"Hello! I don't post a lot on reddit so sorry if this is the wrong place. 
My question is, what should I read(articles, books, etc) to help me learn more about the stock market/investing?
(A little background behind this question if you're interested)

I am going to be starting college this coming fall semester, majoring in economics. Starting school, I'll have money left over after buying my books and supplies for the school year. On top of that money I'll be getting a good amount of money from income tax next year. With this in mind I want to expand my knowledge of investing/stock market/general economics over the months to steer myself in the right direction with my money before I even finish my first year of college as an economics major. I don't want to invest a dime without knowing exactly what I'm doing.
I don't want any get rich quick books. Just good legit advice, and strategies others use, and maybe some very basic starter knowledge too! 
Also post any advice for investing my money if you have the time it would help! Thanx!",16

INFORMATION STATEMENT

General

This Information Statement has been filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") and is being furnished to the holder of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of American Biogenetic Sciences Inc., a Delaware corporation (""we,"" ""us,"" ""our,"" the ""Registrant"" or the ""Corporation""). The purpose of this Information Statement is to provide notice that the Corporation's majority stockholder holding 760,000 shares or approximately 69.8% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Corporation's Common Stock as of the record date of May 29, 2015 (the ""Record Date"") approved the following corporate action (the ""Corporate Action""):

1. An amendment to the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation to change the name of the Corporation from American Biogenetic Sciences Inc. to USA Equities Corp. (the ""Name Change"").

The Corporation will pay all costs associated with the distribution of this Information Statement, including the costs of printing and mailing. The Corporation will reimburse brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable expenses incurred by them in sending this Information Statement to the beneficial owners of its common stock. This Information Statement is expected to be mailed to our stockholder on or about June __, 2015 (the ""Mailing Date"") to the stockholder of the Corporation as of the Record Date.

The Corporation is distributing this Information Statement to its stockholder in full satisfaction of any notice requirements it may have under the Delaware General Corporation Law. No additional action will be undertaken by the Corporation with respect to the receipt of the written consents, and no dissenters' rights are afforded under the Delaware General Corporation Law as a result of the adoption of the Corporate Action.

AMENDMENT TO THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO CHANGE THE NAME OF THE CORPORATION TO USA EQUITIES CORP.

Effective May 29, 2015, the Corporation's Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation to effect the Name Change with the written consent of the Corporation's Majority Consenting Stockholder (the ""Joint Written Consent"").

A copy of the Joint Written Consent is attached as Exhibit A to this Information Statement and a copy of the Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation is attached as Exhibit B to this Information Statement.

Other than the Name Change, the amendment to the Certificate does not amend the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation as presently in effect and will not result in any change to the rights of the Corporation's security holder or to the capital accounts of the Corporation.

Reasons for the Name Change

The Corporation's Board of Directors ratified, approved and recommended that the Corporation's Majority Consenting Stockholder consent to the Name Change to more accurately reflect the fact that the Corporation ceased its former business operation. On September 19, 2002, the Registrant filed a petition under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of New York. On November 4, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court approved an order authorizing a change in control and provided that the Company, subsequent to the bankruptcy proceeding, is free and clear of all liens, claims and other obligations.

The Registrant has no present operations and has determined to direct its efforts and limited resources to pursue new business opportunities.

Name Change and Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation Approved by Written Consent in Lieu of Meeting

The Corporate Action was approved by the Joint Written Consent of the Registrant's Board of Directors and Majority Consenting Stockholder on May 29, 2015, the Record Date, in lieu of holding a meeting of the Registrant's Stockholder. On the Record Date, the Majority Consenting Stockholder held 760,000 shares or approximately 69.8% of the outstanding shares of the Registrant's Common Stock.

WE ARE NOT ASKING YOU FOR A PROXY AND YOU ARE REQUESTED NOT TO SEND US A PROXY.

The remaining stockholder of the Corporation will not be given an opportunity to vote with respect to the Corporate Action, which is limited to the Name Change. All necessary corporate approvals have been obtained, and this Information Statement is furnished solely for the purpose of advising stockholder of the proposed action to be taken by written consent.

The elimination of the need for a meeting of stockholder to approve this action is made possible by Section 228 of the Delaware General Corporate Law, which generally provides that any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholder of a corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholder, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, are signed by persons holding a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the corporation.

Expected Effectiveness of the Name Change

Under Section 14(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act""), the Corporate Action cannot become effective until twenty (20) days after the date that this Information Statement is sent to the Corporation's Stockholder.

To effect the Name Change, the Corporation intends to file a Certificate of Amendment to the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State approximately twenty (20) days after the date that this Information Statement is first sent to the Corporation's Stockholder of record as of the Record Date. A copy of the Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to be filed is attached as Exhibit A to this Information Statement.

No Appraisal Rights

Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Corporation's stockholder are not entitled to appraisal or discount rights with respect to the Name Change or the filing of the Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation.

15-06-02,388jct,Meta: Lingo,"Hey all,

I have been more or less lurker here, trying to gain as much as understanding of this wildly complicated subject through osmosis. One of the hardest parts of 'keeping up with the conversation' is the lingo. I was wondering what the more experienced folk here thought of creating a sidebar entry (probably under the FAQ header) which outlined some of the basic lingo, the basic ideas, etc... to help keep the conversation flowing - while allowing the hangers on to the conversation keep pace.

In my mind this could be anything used in common parlance. From the simplest ideas like 'Blue Chips' and 'YoY' to acronyms like EFTs, OTC, stock jargon like 'Sell put' and even down to more complicated short hands for bigger ideas - today for example I read the phrase ""what the fuck. that is a synthetic long. you basically longed the underlying."" (thanks /u/dunningkrugerpin!) which also made me say ""what the fuck"".

Basically, I wanted to see what people thought about having an accessible lingo guide (mostly so I can have it open on my second monitor) to help the growing community of investors ~~leach~~ learn from the this sub's most active communicators. I'm not really in a spot where I can pull that kind of list together, without requiring too much time in research, but some people here know investing like the backs of their hands (it seems).

15-06-02,388mr3,Taking a tiny profit correcting a wrong account mistake,"About one time in 50 that I enter a trade, the UI glitches and changes from the selected account to the first account in that login while I am entering the limit or other details of the order.  About one in 300 trades, I fail to notice that when reviewing the order before the final confirm click.  I really ought to be more careful, but I'm always thinking about so many other things (beyond double checking the details I just entered) when confirming a trade.  
  
So far as I recall (over a period of many years), I have always gotten pointlessly a little greedy plus a little lucky in correcting those mistakes.  For example, a week ago, I accidentally bought 169 shares of COP at 63.77 in my son's taxable account when I thought I was buying it in his Roth.  So I corrected by buying 170 shares at 63.33 in the Roth and then selling the 169 shares at 63.97.  So I made a few dollars in the taxable account (both accounts have more commission free trades per month than will get used this month) and got one more share (that I tentatively intend to hold long term) then I could have bought with all the cash in the Roth vs. having entered the order correctly the first time.  
  
In theory, waiting (usually hours, rarely weeks, this time a few days) for the tiny fluctuations that let me correct the mistake at a profit vs. never having made the mistake, ought to mean one of these times I worse than fail to correct the mistake (double buy because it went down and stayed down).  But so far as I recall, I got the tiny win every time so far that I made the mistake entering a trade.

15-06-02,3880n6,"Here's what I learned about trailing stops","Disclaimer: I'm new and don't know much despite my reading 7 books. 

So I threw down on yesterday's IMGN ride. I got in around 14.11 and watched it most of the day.  I had a trailing stop of 5% to watch the dips and ride the waves back up. Eventually as the stock rose through $15.00 and stayed, I tightened the TS to 3% good 'til close. 

Well, turns out TDA has a setting that by default trailing stops during AH is disabled. Sweet. The TS kicked in right at open and it sold for around 14.88 or so. 

So I guess the moral of the story is on a highly volatile stock make sure your platform can handle AH movement. Or GTFO at the end of the day. 

I like the use of the trailing stop though for these plays. How does WSB use them on your bets?",4

15-06-02,388t35,401(k) Investment Strategy,"Hello -

I am looking through my 401(k) investments and am trying to decide if I am getting the best bang for my buck or if I should look elsewhere.  Currently, I make about $73k and invest 6% to my 401(k) with a 5% company match.  My goal is to try and get this to about 9-10% by the end of the year.

My current 401(k) balance is $56k and is managed by a third party company and it is currently showing an annual RoR of 5.14%.  

The investment mix is as follows:

* Bond:  4%
* Lifecycle Pre-Mix:  20%
* Large U.S. Equity:  24%
* Small U.S. Equity:  19%
* International Equity:  29%
* Company Stock: 4%

Additionally, the company has charged me a total of about $750 to manage this since 9/2009.  This is my only investment account currently, aside from my pension which has a $6k balance.  Overall between the two, it is projecting an annual income of about $130k with average market performance at age 65.

Should I be doing something different than having this company manage my 401(k)?  Should I look into opening a second type of account somewhere?

15-06-02,3891mv,Should I buy delisted stock if I believe the company will turn around?,"TLDR: Historically, do delisted companies who turn around issue new stock, or relist their old stock?

Background: I'm basically new to stock investing and public offerings.

One company headquarted near where I live and that I've been following in the news for a long time and with whose product and industry I am very familiar has had severe financial problems and had to delist from NASDAQ.  The reason for their financial problems stems from the fact that before recent federal regulations, they were operating basically in a different environment, and they had been projecting revenue that simply isn't reasonable to expect going forward.  In other words, it seems to be a one-time crisis rather than a pattern of mismanagement.  Their OTCBB shares are now trading at pennies.  The company still is operating and has continuing customers, though, and recently was able to write off a lot of its debt and bring in a new management team.

If I believe the underlying business is sound and will generate enough revenue for the company to become profitable again within a few years, should I buy the OTCBB stock in hopes they will gain in value, or is it more likely the company would somehow offer ""new shares"" (not sure of proper terminology) and price of the OTCBB shares would remain relatively constant? If the latter, how does this process work?

EDIT: While I appreciate advice to stay away from OTCBB stock as a relatively new investor, I'd like to note that the point of the question really concerns the process that happens as a company becomes profitable again.  I don't take the matter lightly and am not planning to put a significant portion of my wealth into this or anything like that.",9

15-06-02,389tuv,Question about tender offer and class-action lawsuit with BRDR,"I own some shares of BRDR and the company was sold to Pitney-Bowes. They are offering to purchase all shares at $14.00. The tender offer expires on 6-8-15. 

There is also several law firms that seem to have a class-action suit against them, saying that the price is too low and that they did not properly shop around for other potential buyers.  

&gt; Law office of Brodsky &amp; Smith, LLC announces that it is investigating potential claims against the Board of Directors of Borderfree, Inc. (""Borderfree"" or ""the Company"") (Nasdaq: BRDR) for possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of state law in connection with the sale of the Company to Pitney Bowes, Inc. (""Pitney Bowes"").

&gt;Under the terms of the transaction, Borderfree shareholders will receive only $14.00 in cash for each share of Borderfree stock they own. The investigation concerns whether the Board of Borderfree breached their fiduciary duties to shareholders by failing to adequately shop the Company before agreeing to enter into this transaction, and whether Pitney Bowes is underpaying for Borderfree.

&gt;Further, the investigation seeks to determine if Borderfree shareholders are entitled to additional compensation given that the Company provides e-commerce solutions to large-scale retailers in the U.S. and U.K. combined with the importance of e-commerce in maximizing the global presence of businesses. In addition, the transaction would result in a loss or no real gain for many shareholders. For example Borderfree stock traded at $17.50 per share as recently as June 23, 2014. 

http://www.thestreet.com/story/13162020/1/shareholder-alert-brodsky-smith-llc-announces-investigation-of-the-board-of-directors-of-borderfree-inc.html

I don't know anything about these sort of lawsuits, whether they are common or not, a scam, etc. I also don't know what they would do if they lost the case, the tender offer has expired, and I'm stuck holding this stock. 

Should I just take the $14 tender offer and play it safe?

15-06-03,38ay0t,Can someone please explain Maintenance Margin?,"I've been looking to get back in the game and was researching margin accounts (I currently have a stagnant cash account with TradeKing). Through this I came across Initial and Maintenance Margin. TradeKing has 50% Initial and Maintenance margin on stocks from $3 to $6. This is where I'm running into a theoretical problem. According to the only site I found that gave an example:

&gt;So, for example, if you were buying $10,000 worth of a particular stock, the you would be required to have at least $5000 in your account in order to do so. .... [U]sing our same example where a trader purchased $10,000 worth of stock, once the position is open, the trader will be required to have 25% of the current market value of the position in his or her account in order to continue holding the position. If the price did not move, then the trader would need at least $2500 in his or her account in order to continue holding the position. If the position moved against the trader however and fell to a market value of $9000, then the trader would need (.25*9000) or $2250. Similarly, if the position moved in the traders favor and moved up to a market value of $11,000, then the trader would need $2750 in order to continue holding the position. ([source](http://www.informedtrades.com/157036-difference-between-initial-margin-maintence-margin.html); beware: autoplay video)

So let's say I go full YOLO, all-in with max margin, on a $3-$6 stock. Would that not mean that if the stock moved in my favor, I would technically not have enough in my account to meet the minimum required maintenance margin?

Selloffs resumed with a bang in European bond market as inflation ticked up across Euro zone in May. Sellers seem to be paying not much attention to European Central Bank's (ECB) frontloading of asset purchase.

* **Consumer price index surpassed expectation in May, with headline growing at 0.3% y/y compared to zero per cent prior. Core inflation grew sharply at 0.9% from a year ago, much higher than prior 0.6%.**

* **Rapid expansion of core inflation indicated, that demand might be picking up across Euro zone and weaker Euro is increasing the input costs of producers.**

Spanish 10 year bond yield reached beyond 2%, highest level seen since November last year. Bonds have retreated across Euro zone. Chart courtesy Bloomberg markets.

German bund CFD dropped sharply, trading at 154.13 as of now. Bund traded as high as 155.75 yesterday, before sharp drop. Technically speaking price has made a large engulfing candle yesterday indicating possibilities of further rout. Bund might test support area at 152 once again.

I've had it for less than two years and am now about to switch it to a Merrill Lynch Edge account (self directed with no FA). When I spoke to the consultant on the phone, he tells me about no fees and 100 free trades per month. Sounds great but then I started wondering what actual (hidden) fees I might be paying.

I asked if it was through mutual fund fees (wrong term, I know but essentially it's a fee) and his response was only if I had mutual funds in my portfolio.

I researched this online for a while but I'm still unclear on how I'd be paying for this ML Edge account.

What am I missing here?",2

i) they're one of the only companies in the USA mining uranium

ii) getting permits to mine uranium is very very difficult, takes up to 10 years; they already have permits and already are extracting

iii) price of uranium has potential to fly: 1/5 houses (i believe) in the USA are powered by nuclear

iv) 40% of the worlds uranium is produced by kazakstan (spelling? dont care) which is basically controlled by russia (sketch)

15-06-03,38dgnf,Investment opportunity - Gym ownership,"This is going to be vague since I don't really know much at this point, but one of my best friends works at a local gym. She was sitting in on a managers meeting and they discussed that they were going to be opening up a new location. She asked them about potential for employees to invest in the new gym (this is her second job, her first job pays much better). They said it was a possibility, although entry level was ball parked around $25,000. Since she doesn't have that cash on hand, she approached me and some other friends about each contributing for a combined total of $25,000.  
  
At this point she hasn't had her meeting with the owner and founders yet, so I don't have specifics. But what kind of questions should I be asking? What is the important information I need to see before making such a move?   
  
I will say that it's highly unlikely that I will invest, but it was a new opportunity and I realized that I have zero idea of what questions to even ask. At minimal, the idea is interesting to me.  
  
Does anyone have any experience with this type of thing?

That article indicates that Wingstop is doing around $70 million in sales with 745 stores.  If my math is right, that averages out to a mere $93,959 per store.  That isn't even enough to pay the salaries of a manager, a few cooks and some wait staff.  Not to mention food cost and overhead.  So how the hell do they even come close to making money?

http://www.thestreet.com/story/13144149/1/wingstop-files-for-ipo-seeks-to-raise-86-million.html

Then this article says that they had over $7 million in net income and over $24 million in ""adjusted EBITA"" last year.  I, admittedly, haven't done any research or read any of the SEC filings, so there may be an explanation.

15-06-03,38elrj,Investing in under-valued sectors,"Hey guys,

I stumbled onto an interesting article suggesting investing in specific sectors that are not over-inflated (emerging markets, energy, etc) as the stock market as a whole seems rather over-valued so total market index funds may not be a great bet anymore. Additionally, some of these under-valued sectors like precious metals, finance, and maybe even energy may actually get a boost from a rise in interest rates. [Here's the article](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3118766-with-the-market-overpriced-heres-what-to-do). Any thoughts on this idea? Too risky? Just risky enough?",12

15-06-03,38f9w9,5 Wealth Building Tips From the Millionaire Next Door,"Millionaires – they’re everywhere these days. In 2013 there was a record breaking 12 million of them spread throughout the world, with most of them living right here in our own neighborhoods of North America. With the economy in healthy shape, researchers are expecting this number to continue climbing in coming years.

Do you want to be the next one added to this list?

Well, you can if you heed the advice of others already there. Most millionaires have certain characteristics in common. They didn’t simply wake up one day to find a seven figure number in their bank account. For most it was the result of hard work, investing wisely, and managing their money properly.

If you want to be the next addition to the millionaire list, pay attention to these 5 wealth building tips from the millionaire next door who’s already there.

1. Live frugally

Living frugally probably isn’t the first thing that comes to mind when you think of millionaires, right? After all, they’re the ones taking exotic vacations, owning nice homes, and buying expensive toys.

However, if you were to look into their past you’d likely find that they willingly lived below their means for a period of time.

Living frugally allowed them you to establish a strong financial base, which gave them the financial leverage to live the life they live today. After all, you can’t become wealthy when you’re paying 15% APR on that credit card debt that takes forever to pay down.

2. Start investing…yesterday

If you interview just about any millionaire you’re likely to find that many of them began building their wealth at an early age. By investing while young, they were able harness the power of compounding interest to their benefit, which allowed their wealth to build significantly over time.

Compounding interest is a critically important factor to building wealth. It’s like rolling a snowball down a snowy hill. As it rolls downward it gains momentum and size. The longer the hill, the longer it has to grow in size, and larger it’ll be when it reaches bottom. You’ve got to do the same with your investing. Starting early is key to building wealth.

3. Build your own company, not someone else’s

Millionaires know that to become truly financially successful you’ve got to build your wealth, not someone else’s. This starts by building your own company. When you work for someone else, you’re building a company that you have zero equity in. There will come a day when the owners of the business can sell it for millions, while you’ll still be left working in your cube counting down the days until you hit 65.

Building wealth means putting yourself on the other side of the equation. Instead of growing someone else’s company, invest in your own company that you’ll eventually be able to sell when your working days are over.

4. Invest in appreciating assets

While you used last year’s annual bonus to buy a new new car, or go on a shopping spree the financially smart were saving up to invest in a second home. They bought assets that appreciate in value while you bought depreciating assets. In 5 or 10 years they’ll be able to turn around and sell their property for more than they bought it, while you’re car will be worth pennies on the dollar of what you bought it.

When you have some extra money to spend ask yourself if what you want to buy will be worth more or less in 5 or 10 years. Asking yourself this question will lead you to invest in things that you can enjoy today, and that you’ll be able to sell later for more money than you bought it.

5. Seek knowledge

Finally, one of the most powerful secrets of the wealthy is that they consistently seek out new knowledge.

The great thing about becoming wealthy is that it’s not like trying to play basketball in the NBA. It’s not based on height, coordination, or any physical God given ability outside of your control.

The opportunity to build wealth isn’t something given only to a certain subset of the population. Everyone has the opportunity to become wealthy, and there are nearly a million ways to become a millionaire.

It all starts with knowledge, which is the building block of every successful person out there. It’s as simple as that, and anyone can seek to attain it whether through books or real life experience.

If you want to become the next millionaire added to the list it’s completely up to you. Only you can make it happen, so go do it!",1

A former money manager shares his lessons learned from ""watching extremely successful investors make and lose money. And from losing my own money.""

Some choice nuggets:  

* ""The approach that’s worked best in my experience is investing in high return on capital, low debt, growing companies that have the ability to reinvest earnings in the business and generate high returns on those reinvested earnings""

* ""The approach that almost always results in disaster – investing in cyclical stocks based on P/E ratios. Cyclical stocks are cheapest when, industry-wide, companies are losing money or have very low earnings, and most risky when they have low P/E and high price-to-book ratios""  

* ""There are successful short and long term investors, but rarely are there successful investors who do both. A long-term investor must be a patient person. A short term trader who thrives on, perhaps needs, constant activity is likely to be an impatient person.""  

* ""My skill evolved out of the realization that I could have avoided 90 percent of my disasters by spending a couple of hours with a company’s quarterly balance sheets and income statements."" 

* ""Investing can be looked at as an emotional competition – your emotions and ability to control them versus the emotions of those you buy or sell securities from and to. A primary function of investment strategy is to counteract emotional impulses and thus survive (and take advantage of) adverse market developments. Investment performance is mostly determined by patience, risk management, a willingness to study, and what you do when things go differently than you anticipated. Those factors are personality driven.""

**The Trade:**
I placed an 18 day low probability iron condor yesterday in AAPL.

*-400 Jun'15 126/127/134/135 Iron Condor @ .43 ($17200 Credit)*

**Entry:** IV low, but has been trending down in AAPL for weeks. Strong Resistance at 133 after latest catalysts (Ichan, JP Morgan iphone Estimate Upgrade, etc.) and strong support at lower 129 that quickly returns to 130. Tons of open interest over the next 2 weeks around the 130/131 strike will likely keep this from going far from these strikes without a catalyst to overcome option volume. WWDC is almost a non-event, maybe slightly bullish, market agrees with me, no tangible IV premium for the event. No other foreseeable catalysts coming up to really move this stock in the next 2 weeks.

**Exit:** Jun-12 or Jun-15 will be my exit. Buy back early to avoid quad-witching craziness. Profit target of 50 - 60% max profit. Will start to think about exiting if AAPL closes at a higher than 132.97 or lower than 128.50.",7

This stock cratered like hell when a toxic financer dumped all their shares over a short period last year. A lot of people jumped in for multibag gains on the bounce and it slowly faded after an r/s. The chart tells the tale.

**Catalysts:** Labstyle has some presentation at the 75th annual diabetes something something this month. The bigger deal is the possible FDA approval of the Dario. It's already been approved by Health Canada and a number of Western countries.

It's important to note that sales in Australia et al didn't really begin until after the last 10-k was filed so who knows how it's selling.

**The gamble:** FDA approves the Dario this month and the stock could jump a couple bucks in a few days. It's around .34 today. The downside is that the FDA could respond with questions or clarification instead of an approval, in which case the stock could drop to .10 cents.

As usual with these biotechs, they want to uplist and may r/s to try if the FDA approval doesn't get the price where they want it.

**Full disclosure:** I got a hundred percent gains on it at the last crash, fell in like with the ticker and got back in and was caught in the r/s and joined #baglife. I never sold though because I didn't see the point taking the loss if it could turn into a double bagger for me. My break even is around .75

15-06-04,38gemp,"Brokerage initiated a buy to close on my put option without my knowledge, time to find new firm?","Hi /r/investing.  A new situation to me happened, I could really use some guidance or ideas on this one!  Semi wall of text, I tried to break it down and get the questions in the last part.  

#About me:


Familiar with spreads and greeks.  
Generally do simple bull/bear put spreads or directional options.  Nothing too fancy

#The event:


I had sold put options that were set to expire.  On the last day, there was a price movement that made my winner a loser. 

&amp;nbsp;

About 20 min before market close, I found a price I’m comfortable closing the put at (still at a loss).
I logged into my brokerage account and found that they had initiated a close on the options about 30 minutes before market closing.

&amp;nbsp;

The price they helped me close at was much higher than the final 2 price points in the final 30 minutes of the day.  The price difference essentially incurred an additional loss of about $2300. (I suppose not a large sum in the large scheme of things, but it is not exactly chump change either – and it is the principle of things)

#Aftermath:


I was shocked at the sudden lack of control with my own finances.  The unexpected turn of events was jarring and leaves me unsatisfied.

&amp;nbsp;

Spoke to Local branch manager (LBM), he said that he understands my frustration but this is just part of their risk management strategy

&amp;nbsp;

When asked for the disclosure that explains this process, the response was “Well, if it is a part of our risk management process, we don’t have to disclose those details”.  And actually, reading over all of my options disclosure agreement – it specifically says that I have until the end of the expiration date to take care of matters and doesn’t mention anything about this proactive practice of closing client’s options.

&amp;nbsp;

LBM did try to ask for the trade to be busted, but ‘corporate’ has denied the request.  LBM also offered me some free trades (not close to the ~2k in losses)

#Where I’m at:


- I have had a long history with the brokerage (over 7 years) where I always either bought to close puts or let them expire in the money.
- In all of this time, I have never heard of or been told about this practice.
- I had plenty of funds in my account to close the contracts.
- I don’t understand why they couldn’t of just called/email me the day of and just say ‘hey, are you watching this position’ instead of unilaterally making decisions for me.

&amp;nbsp;

I don’t feel like I’m being treated equitably here. But more importantly, it just seems like they are not willing or able to make it right with the customer.

***

#Questions:


Do I have any recourse other than taking my business elsewhere?

- Ask for monetary reimbursement?  
- Ask for equivalent value in free trades?

&amp;nbsp;

Was it unreasonable for me to not know about this particular practice from my brokerage?  Am I overreacting here?

&amp;nbsp;

When moving to a new brokerage, do they transfer the stocks/fund directly from my old one - how is the experience moving firms?

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks!

15-06-04,38gg6d,How Easy is it to Fix and Flip a House?,"Fix and flipping television shows do a decent job of portraying the process of a flip, but television shows can’t possibly show the entire process and what it takes to flip a home. I have fix and flipped close to 100 homes in the last ten years and I am working on nine fix and flips right now. It takes a lot of work, experience and time to learn to flip homes and make a profit. The profit is determined by many things besides the buy price, the repairs made and the selling price. Those sometimes forgotten costs are what determine if a flip will make money or lose money.

How do fix and flippers find and buy properties?
On most of the flipping shows, the flippers are buying properties at the foreclosure sale. Every state has a different foreclosure process with different rules and guidelines. At the foreclosure sale the bank sends in a minimum bid and if an investor wants to meet or beat that minimum bid they can buy the home for cash.

Buying at the foreclosure sale is very risky, because many times you cannot see the interior of a home or it may still be occupied by the previous owners or tenants. When you buy at the foreclosure sale you have to pay cash within hours of the sale or bring cash with you to the sale. The cash does not have to be a briefcase full of $100 bills, but it does need to be certified funds like a cashier’s check.

I used to buy 90 percent of my fix and flips at the foreclosure sale and a couple of times I got burned. In one instance I bought a house at the foreclosure sale and when we had it rekeyed we found a newer BMW in the garage. I knew something was wrong immediately and I contacted the previous owners who were in California (I am in Colorado). The previous owners claimed the banks foreclosed wrong and was suing the bank. They did not file the lawsuit until after the foreclosure sale and I had no way to know about the lawsuit until after I bought the home. I could not sell the home with an active lawsuit against it and it took over a year for a court to review the case. The court threw out the lawsuit after reviewing it, but I had to hire lawyers to speed up the process. I lost $10,000 on that flip because of the time it took to sell the property and my lawyer’s fees.

If you are wondering about the BMW, the previous owners came and got it. Another misconception about flipping is that the flippers get to keep whatever they find in a house. It is not legal to take whatever you find in a house after you buy it at the foreclosure sale. States have different laws, but in most instances if the value of the personal property left in the house is over $300 a personal property eviction must be done or the property must be stored for months to give the previous owners a chance to get it.

How do I find and buy fix and flips?
I stopped buying at the foreclosure sale because the competition has gotten so intense form other investors that prices are close to what they are on MLS (multiple listing service). I buy almost all of my properties from the MLS, which has its advantages.

I can see the entire house before I buy.
I can get a loan on the property; here is an article on how to finance a fix and flip.
I can do an inspection on the house, although many times I waive this to make my offer more appealing.
I have 15 to 30 days to close on a house instead of 2 hours.
I am a real estate agent so I get paid a commission on most houses I buy through MLS saving me thousands on each deal.
Many people think it is impossible to get a great deal on the MLS in today’s market. My market is no different; our prices have gone up 20 to 30 percent in the last two years and our inventory is very low. I am not saying it is easy to find homes to flip; I check my MLS system five to ten times a day. There are many things I do to get great deals.

I write offers on properties within hours of seeing a good deal
I am very patient; it takes me months to see a good deal worth making an offer on
I invest in small towns where there is not as much competition
I buy houses that need a lot of repairs
What are the real costs of flipping a home?
On television, some shows do a decent job of listing the costs involved and others are horrible. My goal is to make at least $25,000 on each flip I complete and my average buy price is around $100,000. For me to make $25,000 on a flip that I buy for $100,000 I have to sell that house for close to $170,000. The reason I have to sell the flip for so much are the costs involved in flipping.

Buying costs: when you buy a home you have to pay closing costs and those can expensive with a loan. I would estimate I pay $2,000 on a $100,000 purchase.
Carrying costs: When you own a flip you have to pay utilities, take care of the lawn, hold insurance, pay HOA dues, pay interest on your loan and pay taxes. It takes me about six months to flip a house and those costs can easily add up to $5,000.
Repairs: Repairs are almost always more than I expect because you miss things when you see a house and repairs come up that were hidden until you start tearing stuff out. On a typical flip I expect to spend $15,000 on repairs, but I always add $5,000 for unknowns.
Selling costs: I am a Realtor so I save money by listing homes myself. Non agents would pay double the closing costs I would pay. With title insurance, closing fees, recording fees, buyer paid closing costs and real estate commissions I pay $10,000 or more in selling costs. A non agent would pay close to $15,000.
When you add those costs up the breakeven point to make money on your flip is $137,000. That leaves me with a $33,000 profit, which happens to be the average amount I made in 2013 on my fix and flips.

How do you repair a fix and flip?
When I repair my fix and flips I do not do any of the work myself. I hire contractors to do everything, because I have nine flips and there is no way I could do the work myself. If I had one flip I would still hire a contractor because of the time and money I save using a contractor. When I own a flip it costs me from $35 to $50 a day to own that property. If I tried to do the work myself it would take my months to finish a job that would take a professional weeks. That extra time would cost me thousands of dollars and all the money I thought I was saving by not hiring a contractor. On top of the job taking longer, it would not be done as well.

When I repair a flip here are the basics I always do

Make sure major systems work; electrical, plumbing, heating, roofing, etc.
Make sure it looks nice; new paint, new floor coverings, new appliances and new fixtures
 

I try not to make major changes in a floor plan or tear into walls unless necessary. When you make major changes, especially in older homes, you run into big problems. Simple remodels turn complete renovations when walls are taken down. Additions rarely ad enough value to a home to justify the cost either.

Conclusion
There is much more to flipping than what this article contains, but hopefully this lets you know the basic costs and what it takes to fix and flip a home. If you want to get into the flipping business, make sure you find great contractors, because that is by far my biggest headache.",1

15-06-04,38ha7p,Is this **** rigged? (stocks),"I've only been trading stocks for a year but it feels like no matter how hard you study the fundamentals, financials and giving it your DD this feels like a game on chance. It feels like its rigged. I think this is why some people just do yolo bets on /r/wallstreetbets or bet on black/red on /r/pennystocks

I've seen exceptional earnings report resulting in no change in the stock price (looking at you JKS). There's the sudden bankruptcy despite months of positive reports (F you GTAT). The extreme volatility for no apparent reason (EYES). The daily pump and dumps (sup weed stocks). There's the questionable acquisitions that sends the price skyrocketing/falling. The blue chips that barely change price all year except for some random days. There's also others that dont give a shit about support and resistance (BABA).

I'm up 9% since the start of the year. I like to think I managed to do that based on due diligence but deep inside I think its pure dumb luck. These price changes/lack off makes me go WTF. 

Ive been doing forex for about 5 years and at least I feel like I can explain those fluctuations more. ",0
15-06-04,38hb47,Swinging allocations,"Yes. It's market timing. 

My baseline allocation is 90/10. I've been moving to 85/15, aiming to time a market downturn, and reallocating at 5% increments back down 95/5. When a market upswing feels expensive again, swinging back to a 85/15. So it'd look like:

* 85/15
* Market drop - 80/20
* Rebalance - 90/10
* Market drop - 85/15
* Rebalance - 95/5
* Market gain - 97/3
* Rebalance - 90/10
* Market gain - 95/5
* Rebalance - 90/10
*Market gain - 92/8
* Rebalance - 85/15

I see pros as you're still rebalancing and you could capture more gains. If there isn't much movement you're still close to or at your base allocation. Cons are it's market timing. Is there a term for this? ",1

15-06-04,38hde8,How To Use EMA Lines For Understanding Trend,"I thought I would make a post explaining my thought process about how I go about using EMA lines. Basically I spent about a week trying to understand how they work and get a feel for them before getting right into trading (took a week off trading). BLFS was one of the best examples of how level 2 + EMA lines can help you understand when a stock will breakout/breakdown. If you look on the daily chart, BLFS's breakdown looked almost random in a way. Without any indication of it holding anything, it really does seem random (without EMA lines or Level 2). Here is it intraday without any lines: http://i.imgur.com/H55HtcI.png. The only ""technical analysis"" without any EMA's I could make out was that it failed to break back over the 3.25 mark and just gave out. It has been faking out all day so it really did seem random.

Now if we take a look at this chart (just to clarify these are the 9EMA, 50EMA, and 200 EMA on the 5 minute chart): http://i.imgur.com/ti5sLFW.png. See how it held that blue line near the end of the day? Well the stock held that 9EMA extremely well and the bid's started to give away. Big sellers came on the ask and the stock collapsed. This was the only time in the day that it actually held the 9EMA, which was a sign it was going to washout. 

Another example I could find is CDTI on Tuesday. http://i.imgur.com/0O4Jr84.png It spiked up, failed to break out. Had a lower high and tested the 9EMA. This was the first time til that point that the stock actually testing the 9EMA and held. When I say held I mean doesn't finish a candle above it, instead finishes a candle below. While it was more clear when it was going to breakdown, the 9EMA still helped read where it was heading. I use the 9EMA as more of an entry point / risk point.

I'm posting this here because I know we have a lot of you as users - we've been working on building an algorithmic approach to finding and surfacing financial news on a per-company basis. Think of it like each company being its own little mini-subreddit in a way. 

Our system shows articles as well as Tweets for each company and only shows news for the trailing 24 hours so theoretically you can always see what the freshest news is, if any.  Also, if we detect that some stories are more important than others -- we'll break them into a separate category named ""Top Stories"".  We have an algorithm that assigns a story a score and then updates that score as users interact with the articles.

This literally just went live this morning and we're looking for feedback.  The app is totally free with no advertisements -- really just looking to see what people think.

15-06-04,38katk,Question about rising interest rates and impact on different investment sectors.,"A lot of my investments are in banks, energy, REITs a bond fund and other high yield dividend things. In the near term I'm wondering if this is such a good idea. I still have a lot of cash on the sidelines because quite frankly I'm a little aprehensive about us maybe being near a top and also. When the market was way down in 2009 I some things looked like screaming buys I had no free cash to buy things that were at fire sale prices. 

Rising rates seem good for financials- it means hopefully a better economy and more people buying houses/cars etc. It would mean more paid out to savers but more money made on loans. 

What happens to energy stocks and their dividend yields? Also I know with bonds price goes down when yield goes up, but I found a REIT paying 12+% (MITT) and a bond fund (EVV)paying 8% with a monthly dividend. I'm kinda wondering if theyre gonna tank. I plan on holding them a few years- but if theyre gonna go down 30% holding onto them seems like a bad idea when I could invest somewhere else and buy them later. I do have DRIP set up, so it doesnt really matter. Also knowing when to buy back in is a gamble Buying and holding in a market crash hurts- but it's easier than trying to time things.

Wealth Management
Instead of rolling my $41K over to The Principal Financial (where my employer does their 401K) I would roll the money over to him in an IRA. To have them manage the money, it would cost me 1.35%/year ($513/year) with an average annual ROI of 4-6% (on the conservative investments, up to 12% on risky)
 
I feel like this is smart, as it doesn’t sound like there’s a real good chance of my ROI not exceeding the cost of the services.  One big perk  is that with The Principal, I will have to choose (roughly) 1 or 10 investment mixes and that’s it. Through them, the sky is the limit as far as where I want to invest. 

Financial Planning
He would meet with me monthly, quarterly, or however often we want to talk. I inform him of my assets and liabilities, income, goals, plans. They then will be your right hand man to help you plan your finances.
 
This service is $45/month paid Annually (So around $500 a year as well) or it can be done monthly.


I have recently looked at reviews from Ameriprise in general and they are pretty rough. 

At the age of 28 is this a good idea? Just looking for advice as I have never worked with an advisor. 

Thank you all in advance!!

This year, I've seen a drop of over 50% in my portfolio which has been very tough to deal with on some days. 

A lot of these companies are still what I consider to be good companies. Low P/E ratio, good future outlook, and reasonable debt, but their price keeps tanking lower because the price of the underlying asset they represent is decreasing. 

Over the past 6-8 months, I've been continually buying more of their stock and losing as it drops even further and this last week saw another drop of ~15%. 

Fundamentally, I still believe these companies will do well in the future, but I also understand I'm not an expert. I could be wrong. Maybe I'm wrong? Should I stop buying until I see a sustained reversal in the market or should I continue with what I've learned and purchasing at a discount? 

Just as a disclaimer, I'm not strapped for cash, and I'm only putting in my extra money into the market. Already invested into a 401k and maxed my IRA, but at this point I feel at a loss in terms of whether I should finally admit defeat after a year of betting against the bear market or continue forward with reinforcing my positions. 

Alternatively, I could put the rest of my extra money into a fund and let it be managed by a 3rd party while I focus on my personal life, business, and career instead of trying to stay up to date with market news. This is a thought that has crossed my mind a lot as well considering that my purchases have lost me a tremendous amount of money over the past year.

Their P/B ratio is near an all-time low at approximately 3. They have a pretty strong economic moat by being an international company, selling many products at a discount price with a high turnover rate. Though they’ve almost saturated the US market, they still have a lot of potential outside the US (note their recent growth in Canada and Mexico). They’re also investing heavily in e-commerce, which is growing and can actually bring in a lot of revenue in developing countries. Though they’ve seen little revenue growth over the past 5 years, and their stock price is significantly larger than their intrinsic value, I think it may be worth a long term investment seeing how they’re slightly on the cheaper end at the moment.

This deal would mean shipments worth 12 million dollars would be sent to Niger every 2-3 months over the next five years, which would make revenue skyrocket from $7 million in all of 2014 to 36-60 million every year for the next 5. This is a massive jump and its the reason why i want to get in early because i have heard of stocks going up 500% from a 40 million dollar deal and i think this possible 300+ million dollars would cause a similar increase.

Avoiding The GLD
By Turd Ferguson | Thursday, June 4, 2015 at 11:21 am

As the reported ""inventory"" of the GLD moves into negative totals for 2015, I thought it would be fun to bring some of these numbers into perspective once again.

Back on Tuesday, the GLD reported another outflow of ""inventory"". The drop was nearly 5 metric tonnes and it brought the total stated ""inventory"" down to 709.89 metric tonnes. As ""inventory"" began the year at 710.81 mts and price began the year at $1184, you can see that both price and ""inventory"" are now down slightly for all of 2015. But that doesn't quite tell the whole story.

Back on January 1, 2013, the price of paper gold was $1650/ounce. That day, the total ""inventory"" of the GLD stood at 1,349.92 metric tonnes. Again, as of yesterday, price was $1185 and GLD ""inventory"" stood at 709.89 mts. What's the big deal, right? Price is down and ""inventory"" is down, too. But let's put this into perspective as simple numbers often need context to be appreciated.

Since 1/1/13, the GLD inventory is now down 640.03 metric tonnes....

​OR

20,578,000 troy ounces

OR

Slightly more than the combined holdings of Austria, Belgium and Mexico.

Stated another way, since there are about 400 troy ounces in every London Good Delivery Bar, over the past 27 months the GLD has shed about 52,000 of these:

And if you pile 192 of them onto a pallet, suitable for forklift movement back and forth across an LBMA vault, you'd fill about 271 pallets. That's a lot.

Of course, we're supposed to believe that this is all genuine, allocated and real gold...keeping in mind that the custodian for all of this ""gold"" is HSBC. (Yes, the same HSBC that has been charged with all sorts of crimes from tax evasion to market manipulation to money laundering. No doubt, though, that their custodianship of the GLD is on the up-and-up. &lt;sarc&gt;) I'm sure that none of this ""gold"" has been used to satisfy eastern physical demand. It has all simply been shifted out if the GLD and into other vaults, where it sits now, collecting dust...just a useless relic and antique.

But I digress, please allow me to give you some additional perspective...

After the ruthless and merciless, Cartel-sponsored beatdown of April 12-15 2013, a beatdown designed to smash the 19-month floor that had held near $1525, price fell further through June of 2013 before finally bottoming at...wait for it...$1180 on June 28, 2013. So, it has now been nearly two years and price is basically unchanged as of this morning.

But what has happened to the GLD over this same time period? Is its ""inventory"" unchanged, too? Hardly.

On the evening of June 28, 2013, the GLD reported ""inventory"" of 969.50 metric tonnes. Again, as of this last Tuesday and with price nearly unchanged in the 2 years since, total reported ""inventory"" is just 709.89 mts. That's a drop of 259.61 mts or nearly 27%. Using the same visuals as above, that's 8,347,000 troy ounces of about 21,000 London Bars filling 109 pallets. WOW! All while price is unchanged.

So, what's the point of all this?

To me, it's clear that the GLD is being drained of whatever physical gold it holds. This gold is being used to satisfy insatiable Asian/Eastern physical demand. If you own shares of the GLD and you think you actually own ""gold"", you don't. What you own is a simple paper proxy for the gold price. Suitable for day-trading and that's about it.

If you want to really own gold, your only option is to do what the Chinese, Russian, Indians et al are doing...BUY IT AND TAKE DELIVERY. You don't own it unless you hold it. In the end, when the music stops playing and the paper charade fails, those owning shares of GLD will find themselves wanting just the same as any other holder of an unallocated or pooled account.

Now that you know everything about me, I'm here to ask investment strategy advice. Knowing investing is an art, I need advice on books, forums, articles, etc. that can teach me the very basic requirements to understanding the concepts. For instance, what is PMI? I know it is applied to mortgages when down-payments are less than 20%, but why is this applies (risk factor?) and what does it even stand for?

I am curious how this affects both the trader broadcasting their strategy and whether the market reacts to this strategy.   My hypothesis is that traders broadcast their strategies for several reasons:  1) Bragging rights if they are correct and therefore Ego boosting.  2) Hope that other traders will pick their strategy and create a self-fulfilling prophecy so the markets will move in concert with their prediction.  3) Purposely broadcasting a strategy that they believe will fail and taking the other side of the trade.  I am curious what others thoughts are on this and whether there are pros and cons to broadcasting your strategy and how much influence this has on moving the markets. ,4

15-06-05,38n4n2,Value investing question: Does the intrinsic value of a company fluctuate along with the aggregate stock market?,"Value investors consider intrinsic value and market price as two separate concepts. As I understand it, intrinsic value is typically calculated using a discounted cash flow type calculation.

So suppose the aggregate stock market goes down. This generally implies that the discount rate (or equivalently expected return) has gone up. (Expected future dividends may also have gone down, but empirically the vast majority of the change in price is due to changes in expected returns).

In light of this, how do value investors reassess the intrinsic value of a given stock. If the overall discount rate for the market has gone up, then it's arguably gone up as well for this particular stock. That would mean that the intrinsic value would now be lower since cash flows are being discounted at a higher rate.

For the value investors on the sub, how do you determine the discount rate to use for DCF analysis and how does this discount rate change if there is a big change in the overall stock market level?",9

15-06-05,38oipo,How do I create an index fund investment portfolio for a short term and a long term investment goal.,"Hello friends,

I am trying to put together an index fund investment portfolio for 2 goals:
#1 Retirement in 35 years (shooting for $1.5M)
#2 House downpayment in 7 years(ish) (shooting for $80K for a 20% downpayment)

Some basic info that might help:
-$55K salary at a stable job
-Emergency funds: 6 months of expenses in a savings account
-Debt: No debt
-Tax Filing Status: Single
-Tax Rate: 25% Federal, 8.25% State Income 
-State of Residence: Hawaii
-Age: 25

Current Assets: (which I no longer contribute to)
Taxable:
21% American Funds American Balanced Fund (ABALX) (5.75% front load, 0.59% expense ratio)
6% Apple Inc (AAPL)

401 K:
21% JPMorgan Mid Cap Value Fund (FLMVX) (0.97% expense ratio)

Roth IRA:
52% American Funds Washington Mutual Fund (AWSHX)(5.75% front load, 0.6% expense ratio)


Questions:

1. Does this asset allocation seem reasonable:
Goal #1: Retirement. I was thinking about a 60% Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Investor Shares (VTSMX) /30% Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Investor Shares (VGTSX) /10% Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund Investor Shares (VBMFX) 

Goal #2: House. I was thinking about a 40% Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Investor Shares (VTSMX) /20% Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Investor Shares (VGTSX) /40% Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund Investor Shares (VBMFX) 

If all future contributions are weighted 31% to Goal #1: Retirement and 69% to Goal #2: House, then I anticipate I should be able to reach both goals. My total portfolio allocation would be:

46% Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Investor Shares (VTSMX) /23% Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Investor Shares (VGTSX) /31% Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund Investor Shares (VBMFX) 

2. What investment vehicles should I use, knowing that I may want to withdraw up to $80K in 7 years? 
My current plan:
-Taxable: Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Investor Shares (VTSMX) and Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Investor Shares (VGTSX)
-401K: Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Adm (VBTLX)
-Roth IRA: Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund Investor Shares (VBMFX)

There are of course possibilities of unknown asset bubbles bursting, but that can always happen.

I did quite a bit of searching of the internet on this, but I couldn't find an answer.  This is a hypothetical question, and maybe that's why I can't find results - it won't ever happen.

So I'm not going to make any links so this is not considered spam, but I've been looking into investing money down the road and I thought of something that might be fun. A lot of mahogany and teak now comes from plantations so it's viably renewable and economical. My favorite wood to work with is mahogany and I thought of no better way than to possibly invest in trees.
I found one german company randomly that will let you buy trees from seedling for 100 Euro which they will plant in plantations, giving you a gps location and certificate to watch it grow. They said after about 15 years the tree can be cut for lumber, or kept longer to grow larger or be sold off. They almost promised a 15.5% compound interest which after 12 years would put your investment around 300% As an investor, this sounds too good to be true. A large return in less than 20 years time. But it kinda makes sense. Wood demand isn't decreasing anytime soon, so it kinda seems like you'd be buying stock in a living gold or silver, so to say. Now I've never invested before, and this seems like a short time for a large gain but my question is this...has anyone else heard of investing in tree plantations? It seems like a novel idea and as a dude who loves wood, why would you do it differently? It also sounds stable, besides a forest fire, guerrila warfare or this whole tree investing thing is a scam. I don't know, I've never heard of it, and I doubt my 401k guy would want to hear much about it besides throwing more money into his pot, and not others.

It will change how small companies raise money.

A. Become a multimillionaire by age 40. This is what your path looks like: 
i) Keep the $3k safe for now...:Take your $3000 that you have now. Continue saving. Work hard, pinch pennies. Save. Put the $3000 in a CD (6 months at a time is my recommendation) to ensure that you don't touch it! CD = certificate of deposit, you do this with a bank. It is essentially a low-interest savings account where you cant pull your money out for some fixed amount of time. This will be to protect yourself to ensure that you don't spend the money for an ""emergency"".

The few stocks I've seen at least haven't changed too much/before after the date so I was wondering what's preventing people from taking a large position right before the date, being recorded as the holder on the ex-dividend date, and then selling them shortly after and repeating with another stock.

For example, with Gamestop the ex-dividend date is this coming monday. What's to stop someone from buying a large position today, getting their entitlement to 36 cents a share and then exiting taking that easy profit?

Again I am a newer investor so any advice or explanations are appreciated.

""What is an exchange?
The inner workings of the stock market can get very complex and this question has many different technical answers, but an exchange is simply something that facilitates transactions of shares (""trades"") between buyers and sellers. Any time you purchase a share in a stock, there is a seller on the other end of your transaction. This seller may be a large institution (hedge funds, banks, etc.) or another investor like yourself. Similarly, when you sell a share, there is a buyer on the other end of the transaction. The exchange is similar to eBay, which facilitates trades and people can bid on the value of an item. This concept is fundamental to understanding how money is made or lost in the stock market. When you buy a share, you give money to a seller. When you sell a share, a buyer gives you money, and hopefully they give you back more than what you paid, which is determined by the price of the share. Thus, the difference between the amount you paid and eventually received in return is either your profit or loss.""

15-06-05,38p2es,"How to arbitrage the new ""female Viagra"" drug with $PTN","Yesterday, Flibanserin was recommended for approval [by an FDA Advisory Panel.](http://tiny.cc/va62yx) It's my understanding that PTN is in Phase 3 trials for a similar drug, and FDA agency still has not officially approved the drug, Flibanserin (deadline Aug 18).


Despite that, the prediction market on [PredictIt](http://predictit.org) is factoring in a 50:1 probability that Flibanserin is approved for use in 2015.

**Will ""female Viagra"" drug flibanserin be available in the U.S. in 2015?**

[Here's the depth of the market, if you would like to buy or sell a ""Yes"" share](http://i.imgur.com/VMKZZpf.png)

The highlighted order is mine. Currently, I've already bought 100 ""No"" shares at an average of 2.5¢. If you want to buy a yes, I will be selling a yes at 98¢ (synonymous with me buying a No at 2¢).


I will get a payout of $1 for each share, if I am right. Meanwhile, PTN is selling for $1.25, with a 52w low of $0.59. They shot from $0.90 to $1.25 after the FDA panel news hit.


If I pair each long share of PTN with one ""no"" share of Flibanserin, and consider the downside of PTN to be $0.59, I can participate in the upside of PTN with little-to-zero downside. Essentially, my shares in PredictIt act as a super-cheap option, because PTN's value is linked with the approval of Flibanserin.


To lose money, PTN must drop to a share price of $0.25 ($1.25 - $1.00). Anything higher is profit minus commissions. *edit / reminder. flibanserin is not PTN's drug, but PTN is working on a similar ""female viagra"", which is why the performances are linked*",9

&gt;dunning-kruger effect is a cognitive bias wherein unskilled individuals suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their ability to be much higher than is accurate.

The idea goes like this: A guy comments on how to traded that actually has no clue what he is talking about. Obviously you can joke and say I have no idea what I am talking about because I got a few picks ""wrong"" but I still knew what I was talking about. On almost every trading subreddit I have ever been on, I have always seen at least one user that makes the most absurd comments ever. I will not point out anyone in particular, but basically there has been users that legitimately think dip buying pump and dumps is a good idea. Obviously if you ask them basic stuff like if they are using level 2, they have no clue what that even is. (so they are pretty much randomly guessing on an entry, not educated).

I blocked out the usernames in this picture, it was one of the best examples I could find recently:

http://i.imgur.com/3L8WRPo.png

We will call the person replying to ""OP's post"" user 1, and we will call the ""OP"" ""OP"". User 1 replies with legit response, the company was actually a pump. There was a ton of things actually pointing to it being a pump and if he did basic research he would find out.

OP replies with some extremely strange response having absolutely nothing to do with what what user 1 was saying. A company having a great product means literally nothing if they can't sell or profit from it. 

User1 tells him his experience with similar types of stocks and explains why he should really get out. 

OP replies with another very questionable response claiming that he was retarded to invest $30,000. User 1 never said he lost money, he just said he watched it disappear. It could be his friends money for example.

To wrap it up, OP in this picture was making a bunch of excuses as to why he was going to hold the stock. It wasn't any valid reasons, it was just ""I am holding it so fuck you"" kind of responses. You guys should NOT reply to people like this because they are trapped in a world of thinking everyone else is wrong and they are right. These kinds of people do not even know what they are doing, you ask them basic questions and they will have no clue what you are talking about. That is what the Dunning-Kruger effect is.

While it might seem things are only pushed to June-end, I tend to think this time around Greece will technically default since Germany/Greece won't be able to agree on terms and Greece will either have to back to election and/or just exit the Euro.

15-06-07,38uy4z,My hypothetical portfolio,"Hi everyone. I'm new to investing. I've read few books and watched the stock market for a while now. I'm thinking about possible portfolio options. 

About myself:

25 

no wife or kids

steady income every month

no debts apart from student loan
Stable job (IT)

Risk tolerance - medium

timescale - mid to longterm (5+ yrs)

Atm I have nearly £20k. I've been thinking of building a portfolio for £5k initially, adding few grand every year.

I'm aware that with 5k I won't get much so no point getting 50 different stocks etc, I'll buy say 2-3 and keep adding other ones as I add more money.

Now let's go into possible options. I'm thinking something like 70 stocks, 30 bonds.

Couple of things:

1. Individual bonds or mutual? Assuming I'll go for 5+ years

2. Stockwise, something like 30% mutual and 40% individual?

3. I'd want to reinvest the dividends if possible, either shares or cash.

Among the individual I've been thinking to get into few sectors:

energy sector - bp seems to be fairly cheap and the oil is gonna bounce at some point. While I'm waiting for it to bounce back up I'd be getting good dividend. I'm thinking about solarcity too although I'm not sure if renewable energy isn't a money dump atm.

tech - here I've been thinking about apple but it's kinda expensive.  There's a good chance that next Iphone could be shit and the shares could tumble. So my choice would be probably Intel - why? I'm thinking in few years down the line they're gonna make advancements in the CPUs... possibly quantum computers... and Intel owns like 2/3 of the processor market. Plus the dividend is decent.

Social network - twitter seems to be a really good deal atm, it dropped severely over the last few months but haven't researched it properly yet. FB seems like an obvious choice but it's like apple. 

food/pharma - GSK, they seem to have decent dividend and their stocks have fallen recently. Still need to research this one properly. 


Probably few more but atm I'd just inject the money into bp and intel. Any ideas/criticisms about my ideas?",1

The company, on June 04, 2015, revealed the availability of Terminator Genisys: Revolution on the App Store and Google Play. In partnership with Skydance Productions, Glu has developed the official mobile game in conjunction with the new Terminator Genisys film scheduled for U.S. theatrical release from Paramount Pictures on July 1, 2015.

Director Holdings Ltd Tencent acquired 8,500,000 shares of Glu Mobile stock on the open market in a transaction that occurred on Wednesday, June 3rd. The shares were purchased at an average price of $6.00 per share, for a total transaction of $51,000,000.00.

Glu Mobile (NASDAQ:GLUU) last announced its earnings results on Wednesday, April 29th. The company reported $0.02 earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter, beating the consensus estimate of ($0.01) by $0.03. The company had revenue of $62.40 million for the quarter, compared to the consensus estimate of $51.71 million. During the same quarter in the previous year, the company posted $0.06 earnings per share. The company’s revenue for the quarter was up 32.8% on a year-over-year basis. On average, analysts predict that Glu Mobile will post $0.22 earnings per share for the current fiscal year.

""Last Thursday, Glu Games tweeted a very important announcement about Kim Kardashian’s krazy-successful mobile game: The stork was just about to drop a bundle of babies in the Kim Kardashian: Hollywood. ""

**Analysis:**

With a huge buy in recently of 51mil worth of $GLUU shares, a coordinated effort to release their Terminator game just before the actual movie, and earnings above than what was expected, I'd say this stock is undervalued to an extent. Supercell also recently announced a 5.5 Billion valuation which may encourage traders to begin investing more in this sector. They are also showing interest in monetizing their games more by the looks of how they are directing their monetization efforts for their Kardashian game. Additionally, there are trends beginning to take off for their games including Terminator Genisys: Revolution, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, and Racing Rivals. What's your take WSB?",10

15-06-07,38y98p,Ginnie Mae (GNMA) fund instead of short term bond fund for fixed income portion of portfolio,"I've been looking at a short term bond fund and a Ginnie Mae fund. For those not familiar with Ginnie Maes (GNMAs), they are mortgage-backed securities backed by the US government, so they carry no credit risk.

15-06-07,38yb31,Dutch graduate student - help with investing start,"Good evening fellow redditors,

I have become a member of this subreddit a few days ago. I will have finished my Economics and Business bachelor at the University of Amsterdam in roughly a month, if it goes according to plan. I cannot help but think that I have not learned enough at all in order to start as a decent investor. I will start with the free buffettsbooks.com courses during the summer holidays. Is there anything else I can do? Has anyone of you had experience with a uni master course related to investing (planning on choosing Finance, not sure if there is a more specific investing/stock market masters or if Finance caps it the best of all studies)? Right now, a problem I stumble upon is understanding why a share has value. I realize that it is pretty much ownership that drives its value (aside from being able to resell/measly dividend yields), but for what reason should assets-liabilities add up to the total market capitalization of the firm? Let's say that a firm has 0 expected growth the next 1000 years, is it correct that if the firm has 100.000.0 shares outstanding, 1 billion dollars? in assets and no liabilities, that the share price should be pretty much equal to 10.000 dollars? Let's say that someone would buy all of these shares, then he is still not likely to have full control over the firm (statutes), so the shares should be lower than 10.000 each?

Also, how do ETF's work? I understand that if you go long in a share of a fund like Vanguard that you own a part of the fund, but with ETF's this is not the case and you purely speculate on price movements? But who would want to give out an ETF of a stable high-return fund? It is not the fund itsself that gives out ETF's, right?

Lastly, I want to start investing with like 200 dollars, just to get into it a bit. Right now I use the CFD app plus500 but I don't feel like that's the real work, as I want to add in a variety of things such as normal stock. Is there a good broker for this? I was doing some research and I saw that for example etrade, a positively review mobile broker, charges $9.99 commission fees for a stock transaction. Isn't such a fee unrealistically high, with an incredibly low profit potential?

Tips are appreciated. Thank you for reading.

15-06-07,38wk2j,8 people investing to buy an apt to rent out,"update: after a few full days of research, I'm in way over my head on this stuff. the legal structure made sense, but the risk-(and energy)-adjusted return just seems too low compared to what a REIT could do. I'm thinking of just investing the cash in a similar way to the rest of my portfolio, with less of a concentration on bond funds and int'l stocks. So some extra SPDR and then just add to my positions in various vanguard funds. Maybe $10k on a new REIT, my old one was nothing but disappointment (especially given the current market conditions). 

Thanks to all the posters and a big thanks to all the professionals and first-hand experienced people who were able to help me come to this decision. I appreciate your great insight!

original:
25/m/ca, currently have $100k of cash rotting in my savings account that I'm deciding what do to with. I'm budgeting to max out my IRA and 401k, and I have tens of thousands already in taxable investment funds already. I have the cash because of a large investment 'purge' last month I decided to take profits on individual stocks that I no longer care about as well as portions of certain index funds, and my REITs have been tanking so I decided to liquidate that too. I'm budgeting to save at a clip of 33% of take-home pay, and I'm fine with that.

Anyway, I've come across an ""opportunity"" to contribute my $100k along with 7 others i know (friends, friends of friends) toward an $800k down payment on an apartment complex. it's 20% down, 80% financed at 3.99%. The annual cash on cash return is estimated to be ~10% assuming a 90% occupancy rate.

The only other thing I'd do with this cash is stuff it all in SPDR  and call it a day. 

**EDIT:thanks for the initial thoughts, everyone. This does sound like a tremendous pain in the butt; the only reason I'm even considering this is because having 90% of my money in equities feels so passe. My brain thinks that having some physical real estate would help round out the diversification of sources of income: job, dividends/coupons, rental income!

regarding the return, historically the apt has had ~95% occupancy and rarely below 90%, so the 10% return seems fairly ""safe"" and easy to maintain (the interest rate is fixed, so aside from maintenance costs as them come up, costs will be pretty flat). The 8 of us would enter into the purchase with an ""intent to buy and hold""... to help this we've written up 4-year lock-out periods for withdrawing investments, with sufficient notice. That said, I don't know how hard it would be to buy out the other investors down the line... I don't see much upside to the property value unless we try to make it better (we won't), so either way I see this as a ""rental income"" play, and only that. 

As some have pointed out... it sounds like a lot to put into one property. anyone have any experience partnering with others? horror stories or constructive advice is welcome!

15-06-08,390406,Crique my stock strategy fellas. mean reversion,"(forgive some errors in writing, engish is my only language ;) just wanna get this at you w out sidetrack from edit

Ive been doing a form of ""mean reversion'? buyinng at the average low and selling a bit below the avg high in a given month... a lot of preface before explaining further, so:

when you look at each stock, in a 12 month or 24 month period, there will be an average low in a month of -2% to -4% depending on volatility. Each stock of course has its own pattern.
.biotech 9 percent, staples 4 to 6, n so on.

another factor is that which month it is certainly makes a differemce. perhaps there a ton of people who use history as a means to choose which stocks willl strive in  a period, so the history reeinforces itself by buying action.

so to make things simple, each month on the 1st (i have about 100 carefully chosen stocks). i will set an alert 3%  below the open on the first trading day of a month.

This always drives me nuts with uncertainty of quantity but the number of holdings in a given month ive chosen is 25 ( limited by bankroll and trading fees.
wish  i could diversify more to reduce industry voulnerability but po well.).

Hope youre with me still and god bless.  So im workng with 50k plus my margin, so 200k. overnight i can hold 100k, so i have to rebuy in morning.

so to begin:

as each stock hits my -3% alert i buy for 4k (100k /4 = 25 stocks). i do the same thing for other stocks that hit my -3% alert til i have 25 total
.and then each mornings i buy 4k of each of holdings, then sell before close (again, to avoid regt margin call). cost me 25 dollars a day in fees. 500 a month, which will lessen with bigger roll.

As new stocks hit my -3% alert, i replace those with the one that has the the highest unrealized gain. And i keep doing this.

im lost at this point, but heres my point. People that are holding, they go onto each month knowing they will statistically start higher than the indexes or stocks avg low point (runaway market is rare, and it usually comes crashijg down if you dont sell at 3%). therefore, one must wait until the average low price is hit..Also, if you hold til the last day, you miss out on selling at the avg high point, which is a point or two above the avg end point.

so my strategy is to use quality stocks (ones that did well durning the recession and have crushed the sp500 after the worst of the crash was over. naturally i have a shitload of health and biotech and staples and companies that profit from death. high yielding yet recession proof.

oh yeah, so i buy at -3 and i sell for a 3 percent gain, the cool part is that often once three percent is hit, profit takers (or whichever explaination) will unload and drag it back down to the buying zone, so you can get get a 6 percent out of a stock that did nothing  to those who are holding. Or i can simply sell that the average end poinnt or high point..i like selling at point zero tho.

just want to get your thoughts and if you see any issues with this method..essentially buying each stock at a discount each month and selling at premium.",0
15-06-08,38yv2x,Do You Just Sell Your Index Fund and Buy A Different One to Rebalance?,"I'm 28 and I just got started on my company 401k this January and my initial asset allocation is a little high in bonds since I didn't really ponder what the percentages came out to be.

15-06-08,38yxk3,I have questions about leveraged investing and margin accounts.,"So I'll preface this by acknowledging that I realize the risk here here and that I'm not an idiot... 

I'm 25 I have a stable yet modest income with student loans of about 30k ' and live at home. I've recently come to the conclusion that I don't want to be a working stiff for the next 41 or 42 years (that's how long is have to work to get pension without penalty). I've been scouring the net for ways to build wealth and the best idea I've come up with is through the stock market. I realize I could open an Ira and do a few things and slowly accumulate wealth over several decades like everyone else but the way I see it... Basically yolo. 

Anyway, I opened up a cash based scottrade account about 6 months ago with 5k in it to play with and Test out my picks.. I'm up 7% currently. Anyway I've been studying the market and I've learned a lot and feel confident enough to start leveraging and not day trading but more swing trading, holding for a week to a month. 

I have like 10k in cash saved up right now and I have good credit (715) because I keep getting credit card offers in the mail for like 18+ Months interest free lines and I'm thinking about seeing what they'll give me and throwing it in scottrade and using margin on top to boost my earnings. Has this ever worked for people? I am aware everyone is talking about a big correction coming but I think I can offset that pretty fast, as long as it doesn't happen in 2015. 

I'm mostly curious about the logistics of trading through a broker like scottrade. Right now I've been buying and selling 5-6k in stocks at a time but if I raised that to say 50k what would happen? I realize when I buy there needs to be a seller and what price would I uptimately pay per share? Let's say only 25k worth of shares are asked at x price but I order 50k, what will I be paying for the second 25k? what about selling? 

Also, will scottrade give me a margin account? I know the requirements and I'd stay away from being barred a day trader (I would make one or two trades a week max). How do they decide who gets margin and who doesn't? Say I get a margin account, do I have to apply for a loan every time I want to use it or is it like a line of credit? I Understand 25% is the min cash requirement and the rules...

Again I'm not looking for lectures on how it's a stupid plan and I'm going to lose it all. Im no dummy and it's not like I'm going to be buying penny stocks or anything really crazy. I just think I could make a ton of cash if I leveraged and I want to try it.  Advice? 

And still no clarification just a bunch of haters... Wow reddit... Time to stop visiting this site.

15-06-08,3917hq,How to Find and Trade Covered Calls,"**What is a Covered Call?**

A covered call is an options strategy where the investor holds a long position and sells call options against that position. This strategy is typically employed when an investor wants to  generate extra income off of their positions and they believe the price of the underlying stock won’t move in either the positive or negative direction in the short term. 


**Finding the Stocks:**

So many people know that they want to invest in something and even take the first few steps in making this idea a reality. However, a lot of these get lost in the information overload that happens when it comes to analyzing stocks. Is this stock going to go up or go down? Should I focus on fundamental or technical analysis? Do I follow a major firm like Icahn and hope for  the best? Am I going to trade options or normal Equities? What should I look for in a company? What companies are good? The list goes on forever…

Now, imagine that you answered all of these questions and you had a strategy that could pick the best stocks that will earn you almost double the S&amp;P500. The only thing is that every stock doesn’t match this profile and this strategy will result in you spending hours scouring the market for that one golden egg… or at least that’s how it used to go. Thankfully for us we have the power of technology, specifically our computers and the programs on them. Programs such as screeners allow us to input our golden egg strategy once and it will scour the market for us, responding with every stock that fits the profile in a matter of seconds. It’s actually fairly magical. Because it is so easy to scour the market using a screener it is always my first stop when it comes to analyzing the market for stocks to invest in. 

For this article we are looking for stocks with good fundamentals that have had a history of increasing in price because covered calls are always a neutral/bullish play.


**The Screener:**

When writing a covered call screen we care less about how much a screener makes over time and more about how many stocks win/lose over time.

*First, we want to make sure we can actually write an option for the security

*The earnings per share in the last quarter needs to be higher than the dividend per share. This ensures that the company isn’t overpaying dividends to its investors at an unsustainable level.

*The dollar volume over the past ten days needs to be over $1 million

*The shares outstanding needs to be shrinking over the past 80 days.

*The change of the stock’s closing price over the past year needs to rank in the top 90% of the market

*The P/E needs to fall between 0 and 20


So what kind of stocks does this screen return?

*ANTM

*AET

*MATX

*CALM

*MGPI

*TSRA

*PATK


Now, how does this screen perform over the past three years?


Alright, not too bad. 22.14% a year isn’t anything to scoff at. Now remember, this is just the basic screen. Now we need to go ahead and change a few settings to simulate what would happen if you were writing calls against these long positions. 


*Since we are trading stock options a buyer can exercise their option at any point during the life of the option we need to place a stop gain around the point that a person would tend to exercise their right to buy. After a bit of research we decided that the best stop gain is roughly 7%.


*We also need to adjust our definition of a good return and a bad return. 

*We set a bad return to -4%. At this point, the option is going to expire worthless and we are typically around or underneath our breakeven point. Stocks that fall on the -4% line should either be sold or held if there is still a bullish outlook. 

*We set a good return to 4%. At this point the option will expire in the money, but the buyer is less likely to exercise this option if there’s only a 4% gain. In the event the buyer doesn’t exercise you will receive the premium + the appreciation in the stock price. However, we want to assume that the buyer will exercise the option, in which case you will still be able to collect the whole premium.


Let’s run that backtest.


Okay, so we didn’t earn as much as we did before. On the other hand when we take a look at the heat map we can see that a large majority of the positions we took on were winners. If the majority of the positions win then we will be able to collect our premium more likely than not. About 80-90% of all of our positions were winners.


Now that we’ve verified that this strategy works we need to figure out which security we want to trade the options on.


Looking at the results we want to pick a stock that has consistently increased over the past five years and does not have an ex-dividend date within the next month.


**Trading the Option:**

So now that we have our stock it’s time to head on over to thinkorswim, or whatever brokerage platform you use, and analyze the options associated with that stock.

As you can AET is currently trading at $116.86/share. AET also has an ex-dividend date on 7/14/15, that means we need to trade an option that expires before that date as the stock price tends to fall on the date of the ex-dividend. Focusing on only the options of mid-June and early-July we have strike prices that range from $115-$118.

This part is where personal preference comes into play. The amount of risk you’re willing to take will determine which contract you choose. Personally, I want to collect as much premium as possible, and I think that AET will easily go above $118/share by the end of the first week of July. This trade will allow me to collect $3,840 in premiums when I purchase 1,000 shares and sell 10 calls against those shares.

Alright! Now that we’ve gone through the entire analysis process let’s make that trade on our EquitiesLab experimental account and start looking for new strategies! We will keep you all updated on the status of the account as we release more articles based on how you can use EquitiesLab to not only become a better investor, but a smarter investor.

""Investors throw around the terms bull market and bear market with ease, but there are so many different ways to define them that it can be somewhat confusing. For some reason, a 20% gain is considered a bull market while a 20% loss is considered a bear market. Why not 19% or 21% or another level completely? You got me. And then there are cyclical bulls within secular bears just like there are cyclical bears within secular bulls.

It can also be difficult to define the start of a bull market. Everyone assumes the current run in stocks started when the market bottomed out in early March of 2009. But is that really the start date or should we go by the date when we passed through the previous 2007 high which wasn’t breached until 2013?""

So i joined PTC sites and checked out some HYIP. as you know PTC are way to slow to start earning even 10 euros a month after 6 months because most of them are always going into debt swaps like paidverts or they are just that... too slow, i can get like 2 cents a day for now. and HYIP is almost impossible to get a legit one. and i don't want to risk my time and money to get in scams like those. So my only option is Shares, Forex Exchange or investments. I thought about some Crowd funding sites but those take way too long to get my money back... and when i would get my money back, it would've been cents probably because i can only afford so much. So i started looking into Forex and Shares. i found some sites through reddit: baby pips, Buffettsbooks and mettinvest. now i have some vacation i can read and learn something. 

so i wanted to ask, is this the best way to get into that kind of online income so in 1 year or so i can get some healthy income without spending too much time on pc? like 150 or 200 euros a month? isn't 50 euros too low? and if it is where can i invest those 50 euros wisely?

Allstate is the largest public insurer in the country, with operations in U.S. and Canada. It is a component of S&amp;P500 and has 11 analysts rating it a buy, 1 overweight, 14 hold, and only one sell. They are an insurance company with products ranging from Auto/Home/Life/Business Insurance to Retirement &amp; Investing products. Allstate holds two subsidiaries; Encompass Insurance and Esurance.

A quick look at their 2015Q1 financial report shows promising numbers. Net income rose 10.4%, and operating income 4.8%. 82% of revenue comes from property liability insurance which aligns with economic data showing great construction, home sales, and more. Homeowner insurances increased .3% with constant growth since 2013Q3. The company's market cap of 27.19 billion is supported by their revenue of 35+ billion. They feature a strong profit margin of 8.25% and a higher operating margin of 13.54% showing low costs within the business. They have little debt, with total cash holdings of $3.41 billion, debt of $5.19 billion, and total debt/equity of 23.42 which is low. Now compare that to a company like GE that is in most mutual funds with a debt/equity of 300. The company has a low P/E of 10.21, 30% lower than the industry average. Allstate also features a high EPS of 6.51, and a  nice dividend of 1.8%. 

Looking ahead we see that healthcare premiums are rising, and so might life insurance which will add to Allstate's profit. Allstate also actively engages in aggressive advertising like the successful Superbowl ad #EsuranceSave30. They market through NCAA, MLS, and College Football as well. 

Allstate is talking about selling customer driving data for profit, and data mining is a rapidly growing industry. They have also taken the initiative to insure Uber &amp; Lyft drivers in four states and will expand from there. Uber &amp; Lyft are growing at an astonishing rate and if Allstate corners the market share they may see a sharp rise in revenue.

15-06-08,391z63,Binary Options - Has anyone had any experience or success? What are my other options?,"Hello /investing gurus, 

About me : recently started working and have some $$$ saved up looking to invest in something with relativity high returns, willing to take the risk if its a ""smart"" gamble.

Now I've done some research about Binary Options on this subreddit and a lot of the responses are generally going to the direction about how this is exactly like gambling and that I would essentially have more luck and possibly more fun if I took my money to the baccarat tables. 

And now here I am pondering if its really worth it and if its not what are my other options? I have had some experience with stock markets as I used to work for an investment advisor, no experience with actual purchasing/selling stocks personally but I am quite familiar with technical analysis/chart trends which I think is the ultimate deciding factor in success with binary options (opinions welcome!)

My game plan: 

start with initial deposit say $5000, each position taken will be &lt; 1% of capital most brokerage offer a payout of 60% give or take, so with that we can calculate each position if I am correct I will gain about 1.6% in capital gains and if I am wrong I will lose 1% so I would need to be correct 2/3 positions taken to be ""in the money"". 

now those seem like pretty bad odds, I know... but at the same time it provides the greatest returns so high risk high reward? Using that example with $5K if I am able to achieve 2/3 positions won after 100 trades I would have profited 20%, $1000 in other words... thoughts on this?

And if not Binary Options then what other options are out there? Trading stocks in general I feel you would need a much larger capital to have any kind of significant gains, 1-5% returns on $5000 isn't exactly the returns one would hope for... ",4

However, I'm really having doubts people are going to pay the 9.95 as they can use pandora or spotify. During the keynote, they made a point to say that services like spotify and pandora rely heavily on algorithms to play your next song and it sometimes doesn't deliver. One of the features about apple music that could help is the fact that Artists can connect easier with fans and hopefully start generating more income for artists. Who knows, we'll see what happens.

15-06-09,393qnw,Contrarian Investing can be Used for Different Time Frames,"Contrarian investing is all about extremes. When the market moves to one extreme, it will bounce back the other way. But the important question is, what is “extreme”? Extreme is a relative term, depending on your time frame. A 10% decline in one day is considered extreme, whereas a 10% decline in one month is considered normal.

Thus, there are different levels of extreme, which means that contrarian investing can be used for different time frames. A contrarian investment can have a time frame of a few days, a few weeks, a few months, or even a few years.

Multi-Year Contrarian Investing
Multi-year contrarian investing is similar to secular investing in that you’re playing the cyclical trends that each last 3-5 years. This is known as catching the falling knife, which back in my post on Secular Investing I advised against. I only advised against catching the falling knife because we didn’t talk about the tools need to catch the market bottom or peak.

Contrarian Investing Oscillators and time / magnitude extremes do this for us – they tell us when a multi-year market trend is highly oversold or overbought. Oscillators can be adjusted based on the time frame of your investment. RSI is based on the “close price”. But that close price can be adjusted. Is it the weekly close price (price as of 4pm Friday) or is it the daily close price (price as of 4 pm Monday to Friday). For multi-year contrarian investing, use the weekly close (some people even use the monthly close – the close on the last day of each month) for RSI. That’s because a shorter term RSI (e.g. daily) should not be used for making longer term investment decisions – doing so just doesn’t make sense!

Keep in mind that multi-year contrarian investing won’t allow you to be very precise with the multi-year peak or bottom. For example, RSI and magnitude / time extremes sent SELL signals in January 2007, a full half year before the market did peak. Had you gone short in January 2007, you would have experienced a half year of pain. But that’s the price longer term investors have to pay.

Similarly, RSI and magnitude / time extremes sent BUY signals in December 2008. That’s 35% away from the market bottom!

But although you can’t catch the exact bottom or top, you can get very close.

Multi-Month Contrarian Investing
Multi-month contrarian investing involves playing the monthly market waves. Investments typically last from a few months (ie 2 months) to less than a year (ie 10 months).

When a market has gone in one direction nonstop for several months, RSI and time / magnitude extremes should send signals to invest the other way. In terms of these kinds of medium term investments, it’s best to use daily close as a price input for your RSI.

Short Term Contrarian Investing
Short term contrarian investing isn’t that popular. I don’t know why, but I’ve tested this time frame out before (investments are more like trades – they last just a few days to max. a few weeks). For some reason, RSI doesn’t work very well on these shorter term frames. Maybe because there’s just too much “noise” (false price action) in the short term that renders contrarian investing useless.

All in all, I prefer using contrarian investment tactics for multi-month time frames. Long term contrarian investing means that the price you enter your investment in may be far off from the ultimate peak or bottom.

A Caveat – The Problem with RSI

RSI sometimes doesn’t work very well. Here’s an example:

Let’s assume that the market was falling, and RSI fell to 20. Thus, a BUY signal was generated. However, RSI can back off from Oversold levels merely by the price not falling. That means, if the price doesn’t rally but it stays flat, the Oversold sign is negated. Thus, your long bullish position means nothing.
The opposite is also true.",1
15-06-09,3955bu,When to sell at a squeeze out,"Hi

I own stocks in a company which was purchased by another company. The new company now has the majority of stocks and is now in the process of the squeeze out (as they stated from the beginning) to get all of the stocks.

They offered the shareholder 7,75 € / share when they first started to buy all the shares from the minority shareholder. In the recently published ad hoc news, the cash settlement would be 7,68 € / share. The average price of a share over the last three months (SMA 90) is around 7,78 € / share.

As I have never been in such a situation I'm unsure if I should sit it out and wait (I've read that there might be a potential 10 - 20 % raise in the offer from the majority share holder to avoid a lawsuit against the price of a share in the cash settlement) or if I should try to sell it now and try to get more that the 7,78 € the offered.
What is generally a good strategy in such situations (I've also read that some are specialising in buying these soon-to-be-taken-over companies to make a profit from the squeeze out process)

So just recently Overstock offered a $25m bond to accredited investors in the form of 25 million ""tokens"" backed by Bitcoin. Technically, these tokens could be sent to anyone's bitcoin wallet, even non-accredited investors, but would that be legal? Could a company theoretically circumvent SEC public offering rules and regulations by doing this? Would such a circumvention itself be illegal? I'm just wondering because before bitcoin it was difficult if not impossible to do this safely, but now the rules that help protect people from fraudulent activity of this nature are largely irrelevant. If someone was willing to sell me some of these bond tokens, it would be trivial to prove that the tokens they'd be selling me are real.

15-06-09,3985il,How the Investment Advisor Game is Played,"To end this section on Buy and Hold, let me give you one caveat. When it comes to buy and hold, do not buy to what your Investment Advisor (IA) tells you to buy. I speak of this from personal experience. This is my story.

Back in my college days, I worked at a co-op position at a bank. I was working on the investment advisory side of things where I worked under an Investment Advisor (IA). In essence, we were doing the retail side of investing (working with mom and pop investors). For the sake of anonymity, let’s call my supervisor (the Investment Advisor) Jake (that’s not his real name).

Jake wasn’t just any old Investment Advisor at our bank – he was one of the VP’s (at 40 years old, he’s a hotshot in the bank). And let me tell you – despite all his credentials and certification (President of this organization and that council), his investment advice sucked. If contribution to society were to be a benchmark for his annual salary+bonus, this guy should have been billed. Why? Because Investment Advisors in general don’t care about generating superior investment returns. They care about growing assets under management. That’s because Investment Advisors aren’t paid on performance fees (eg 20% of profits). Investment Advisors make fees from selling expensive financial products (eg mutual funds) and management fees. Thus, there’s a huge conflict of interest. For Investment Advisors, the more money they have under management, the more money Investment Advisors will make. Whether they generate investment returns on those assets or not is inconsequential.

I can list out the terrible advice that my Investment Advisors gave to his “clients” (more like”victims” if you ask me).

Buy stocks in 1999. A year later, market tanks. “Don’t worry about those losses guys! We’re buying and holding!”
Sell stocks in 2001, because the “secular bear market is here”. Needless to say, he was 2 months away from selling at the bottom.
Buy stocks in early 2006. He made a ton of money in 2006 and some money in 2007. 2008 came along, and half of his assets vanished (losses).
Thus, whenever Investment Advisors like Jake lose money, they will wheel in the standard “buy and hold” line. “Oh, don’t worry about that horrific loss. We’re long term investors, so we’ll just hold onto this loss for 10 years until it breaks even”. Over his career, Jake has made practically $0. But he’s a hotshot at the bank because he pulls in the most assets under management (just shy of $100 million).

That is why you should never listen to Investment Advisors when it comes to buy and hold. Buy and hold is an investment strategy. You have to know what you’re doing. What these IA’s are doing is turning buy and hold into hope, which is not an investment strategy. “If we buy and hold this investment for 20 years, let’s hope we make money”. And we all know that hope is the number one cause of disaster for investors. It’s like a gambling mentality.

I have a friend who told me a pretty funny story. One day he and his Investment Advisor were sitting down during their quarterly review. The IA proudly proclaimed “I haven’t lost any money in 10 years!” My friend practically hit the roof because zero profits in 10 years isn’t exactly a happy thing to think of (bonds pay even more).

So why are most trade Investment Advisors so incapable? Because the Investment Advisor game is wrong. In order to be an Investment Advisor, you have to go through a ton of standardized industry tests. But reality is, these tests are absolutely useless! A successful investor is not determined by whether or not he/she can pass a test or not. Investing isn’t a scinece – unlike on a test, there is no absolute right or wrong answer.

If these tests really were that eff’ing useful, the people with the highest IQ’s would be the best investors. And obviously that’s not true! Some of the best traders and investors were ex-soldiers. They succeeded not because they had a superior IQ but because they understood the concept of risk management.",1

In this day and age who *isn't* looking to add a high flier, trading at 45x P/E to the portfolio?  Who *isn't* looking to buy into the most expensive name in a sector?  Who *isn't* looking to buy into a company more highly levered than all of it's peers?  Don't these characteristics just scream **LONG-TERM INVESTMENT WITH HUGE GROWTH POTENTIAL** to you?!

If this is what you look to invest in then Restoration Hardware is the stock for you.  After last quarter's lower-than-anticipated revenue guidance Goldman geniusly initiated on $RH with a $100 price target that is full of golden tidbits of wisdom.  Yes, $RH may be burning cash up the wazoo, and yes, revenue growth this year is going to be slower than in the previous years, but it's *temporary.*  The real time to look at $RH is *NEXT* year, once the CapEx cycle come through and $RH completes the building of it's largest stores to date. Sure, the port issues on the west coast interrupted their supply chain and delayed revenue recognition, but it's not like there are any issues with imports and exports out of China today.  Sure, same store sales growth, which had been growing in the 20% range for the past 2 years, is slowing, but that doesn't mean it won't re-accelerate next year.

Their CEO Gary Friedman is nothing short of a savant, full of such genius insights into running a consumer oriented business such as *""Great brands don't chase customers, customers chase great brands.""*  Not only that, but he actually signs off his share holder letters with [*""Carpe Diem.""*](https://www.restorationhardware.com/content/page.jsp?id=gary-2013-spring)  I mean, how fucking *COOL* is this guy?!

Last but not least, in your DD you may come across insider selling.  But don't fret because, as Peter Lynch says, ""You never know why one may be selling, but you always know why they are buying - because they think it's going to go up.""  [There was some buying](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/rh/insider-trades) in the last 12 months, so I mean, *somebody* thinks it's going to go up.

15-06-10,398esn,"MJMJ Here's some research for you guys","The company issued a convertible bond to Magna Equities I, LLC and Magna Equities II, LLC on June 1, 2015. The bond is convertible at the lower of 40% of the prior ten days trading or at $0.02 per share. Additionally, the bond could not be exercised if the exercise would be for more than 4.99% of the company. Luckily for Magane I and Magna II authorized shares were just raised from 100.0M to 1.0B and shares have been issued. 


So, they will be looking at a conversion price tomorrow of around .001-.002. The owner could convert the debt, whip the debt off the companies book and sell to market at the newly inflated price.

CSIQ announced 1Q15 results with core net profit of US$54mn vs. US$81mn in 4Q14 and US$10mn in 1Q14. Module shipment in 1Q15 reached a record high of 1.23GW, well exceeding the previous guidance of 1.0-1.03GW on strong demand in Japan and the UK. On the other hand, gross margin slid from 19.3% in 4Q14 to 17.8% in 1Q15, on lower ASP (US$0.62/w in 4Q14 vs.US$0.58-59 in 1Q15). Total solution projects delivery with CSIQ’s plan, with 30MW booked in 1Q15.

Although there might be temporary weakness in margin and revenue bookings in 2Q-3Q15 due to a business model transformation from Build/Sell to Own/Operate, I believe that could allow for more predictable earnings and cashflow in the long run given the planned establishment of the YieldCo (which is a key part of this) may allow for lower cost of capital and more sustainable earnings/cashflow. In addition,management expects module shipment and margin to recover in 3Q15 on seasonality and ongoing cost reductions. CSIQ maintained its target to lower overall production cost to US$40/w by end 2015, vs. current US$0.44/w.

The stock minimally should trade at 55-60 range. What am I missing?

15-06-09,396bxs,"BMW Analysis &amp; Evaluation","Earlier while working I reported on [BMW](http://buff.ly/1f0zfYa?), and thought I'd share here for you guys. 

Bayerische Motoren Werke AG or BMW is one of the most recognizable brands of the world among Coca-Cola, Philip Morris, and Boeing. This Germany company is a luxury manufacturer of automobiles, motorcycles, and engines. BMW is a component of the DAX, Germany's stock index. With an 'A-' rating from Morningstar it has 10 analysts rating it a buy, 1 overweight, 13 hold, 2 underweight, and 5 sell. BAMXY the OTC ticker for BMW.DE is expected to grow from 36.20 to 43 within the year, a 16% increase (twice the average return on the S&amp;P500).  

BMW is not just producing the M3 you saw on the road earlier, but it also has a bustling motorcycle sector and owns two very recognizable and iconic cars; Rolls-Royce &amp; Mini Cooper. Looking at the financials, and the last quarterly report the automotive company released, we can see positive trends. BMW had an 8.1% increase in units sold. With a 5.5% increase in the workforce, it seems like their bet of hiring more people produced an efficient productivity. 5.4% within the BMW brand and a staggering **28.4%** increase in MINI Coopers. Rolls-Royce sold 116 less units at a -12.9% decrease, possibly due to the fact that they sold the most units in the last quarter and not everybody needs to buy a new Rolls-Royce every three months. Rolls-Royce is seeing great long-run growth with a 1.5% increase from 2012 to 2013, and a 10% increase from 2013 to 2014. The cars are emerging in popularity in Asia's top 1% and the Middle East.

Cars aren't the only thing BMW is excelling at, BMW Motorrad their motorcycle division saw a 9.2% increase in units sold. Southern Europe is driving sales as they are hitting recovery (Italy escaping the grips of recession), but a -4.9% decrease in the USA due to high competition with cheaper Asian bikes. Demand for 500cc motorcycles is increasing, a specialty of the company. 

The financial services has also increased by leasing/credit financing to retail customers at a 10.5% increase. Other segments of BMW only total around 2 million Euros, which stayed relatively flat quarter by quarter. That segment includes bicycles, brand agreements, and more.

EBIT looks impressive at a 20.6% increase. BMW's P/E is 10.97 compared to the industry average of 12.7 and an EPS of 8.92 compared to the industry average of 6.71. Profit margins look favorable on BMW's behalf compared to competitors with a profit margin of 7.05% compared to Daimler's 5.87%, and an operating margin of 11.36% compared to Daimler's 7.55%. This shows that not only are they more profitable on the sell side of their units, but in managing their business they keep lower costs. Their quarterly revenue growth is impressive at 14.7%, resulting in a 4% increase in quarterly earnings growth. The downside of BMW's financials is its debt. They have $11 billion in cash, but $89 billion in debt. This is not that surprising as their debt has not increased substantially and is a result of the recession. 

Looking at a market environment from a macro level is important, and we see automobile markets are looking positive. European luxury cars are gaining up on the market share vs. Asian manufacturers as employment is up, and wages are just starting to tilt upwards. A little of a fourth of BMW's sales are to these four European countries; Germany, G.B., France, &amp; Italy. Vehicle registration is up in those economies respectively at 6.4%, 6.8%, 7.2%, and 13.2%. Also a lower Euro means good news for exporting, and a stronger dollar strengthens their position in the U.S. market. 

Looking ahead we see a newly anticipated 7 series, the I series to compete with Tesla and will hit the luxury electric-car market, X-series rapidly increasing in popularity, and integrating technology within their cars that is unrivaled. A quick Google Trend search inquiry shows the growth of their popularity in the car market, as well as motorcycles. 

The problem in the short term seems to it susceptibility to Greece's debt news, but in the long-run the numbers speak for themselves.

I am looking to start out with around $5000. I have no interest in getting loaded down into the details myself and would prefer a set it and forget it approach.

I already have a decent emergency fund and have a retirement plan through my employer. This investment would be shorter term (not retirement). Somewhere in the 5 to 10 year range probably. I am not very concerned about month to month risk as long as I can expect to earn it back in the long term.

From what I have read here and across the web it seems the best bet for me is an index fund. Am I correct in that conclusion?

15-06-09,3971ji,My stock portfolio has dropped 18% in last 6 - 12 months. Do I hold on or do I cut my losses?,"I first posted this in r/finance, and was told r/investing would be more helpful. 

I guess my stock portfolio is pretty humble, but it's all I got, and it's important to me. I had 66K worth of investments spread mostly across 5 different companies.  Now it's at 54K.  My priorities for my portfolio is for long-term investment with regular dividends to supplement my income.  

I'm an amateur, but they all seemed like solid companies when I bought them--in growth sectors, high performers in their field, well-rated (at the time I purchased them). They include a major pharmaceutical, a regional telecom, regional energy (ConEd), a retail real estate company, and a maritime shipping company.  

4 of the 5 have been dropping in value for months. The only one that's a net gain is also down from a much higher position a few months ago. The whole portfolio is down 18% and falls daily. Daily! It's so demoralizing. My biggest investment is down 40%. 

I bought 2 of them higher in their range than I should have, but the other 3 were mid-price, judging by their 52-week range.  

Do I wait for these to rebound or do I cut my losses and sell off? If I sell off now, I'll probably never get that 18% value back. But will I just keep loosing value by sticking with what I got?

15-06-10,399mco,Just forget about your investments already!,"When I have a bit of time on my hands, I like to trade over short periods of time. Usually I stick to gold and currencies, which I feel more comfortable with, but once in a while I’ll trade indexes too. I just try to wait until people freak out about an index being really low, like hitting a 6-month or 12-month low, and buy. You can’t really go wrong with indexes, they always end up going up, the only thing is how long will it take, and if you get scared, or need the money right now, you may exit a losing position. I can afford to wait, so it is not a risky trade if the index goes South for a while.

Anyway, I read that the S&amp;P500 was super low, and people were starting to get worried, so following the “when others cry, you should buy” precept, I went ahead and bought some.

Then later in the day, I had a small profit, and started wondering, like anyone else, if it would still go down some more. So I closed my position, took my profit and called it a day.

Look, it’s here:

spx500

 

I bought on the little blue dot, saw it go up, then as I only had the knowledge of the past prices to the left, thought it may hit another bottom, and sold on the little orange dot, just as the index was starting to go up big time. I had 5 units, so those 20 points made me about $100, which is still better than a loss. Had I kept the trade open, gone on with my day and sold it at the end of the week, I would have had $500 instead. I got emotional, and missed out on the price raise.

If you look at it from the past year, the buy was solid, it was a 6 month low and everything looked good.

spx500 year

Until I became my own worst enemy.

And I am not the only one. There is a study from Fidelity that shows the accounts that best performed where the ones people didn’t touch, because they forgot they even had a trading account! You know that the majority of fund managers underperform compared to indexes. A handful will perform better and everyone will want in, until they stop performing so well, because they took too many risks.

But one of the biggest mistake investors make is selling too soon, and holding to losing positions for too long.

My day trades are just another way to diversify my income streams and I don’t take trading very seriously, but if you are saving for retirement and want a nest egg you can actually count on, do the exact opposite: buy indexes, every month like clockwork, and forget about them until you retire.

In other words, how much money did I lose or gain by spending the extra money toward my auto loan instead of, say, Vanguard's index funds (a realistic alternative for me) over 5 years or 60 months?

If you're curious why I paid it off quickly, it was because I'm not a fan of owing large sums of money to anybody. It's a principal thing, and I find great pleasure in realizing that I'm not part of the grind. Please keep the discussion on the actual question instead of on why I did it.

I had some fun playing around with small amounts of my own money, but I can't spend as much time as I should researching who's out there, keeping up with the news, or understanding all the details a person should know.

Are there people out there who will handle my investments for me? Running their ideas past me, but essentially using their expertise to up the odds that we'll get a positive return?

How much would this cost? I'm thinking it will either be based on having him on ""retainer"", or he gets a certain percent of the profits. I like the idea of the second possibility, but I'm worried I won't have enough for him to want to invest for me.

Isn't a mutual fund something like this? Enough people pay someone a small amount and it makes it worthwhile for the person managing the money.

So should I go mutual fund or ""private"" person to manage all my money. His cost shouldn't matter too much as long as he still leaves me with more money than I started with.

How much would I need to get started with in these situations? I've been told to get start young (20s for me) And not use money you can't afford to lose completely. If the minimum I could start with is too much, I won't pursue the idea, but I might be able to afford the ""extra"" money to be invested depending on the fees and minimums.",0

15-06-11,39du00,Understanding The Basics of The Thrift Savings Plan,"Most people that work for the federal government have a basic idea of what a Thrift Savings Plan is. However, investing for retirement can be difficult regardless of the particular type of plan that is used. As a result, it is important to understand the basics of a Thrift Savings Plan, more commonly referred to as the TSP. Things like TSP allocations and TSP investing are important to understand. It is also important to understand how this type of plan is related to a traditional 401(k) retirement plan.

The Basics
The basics of a Thrift Savings Plan are fairly straightforward. People that are eligible for this type of plan must work for the government and they can join immediately upon being hired. Individuals are currently able to contribute as much as $17,500 a year to their TSP account. This is limited by the maximum amount of money that the Internal Revenue Service will allow to be contributed to any retirement account. The Thrift Savings Plan does allow individuals to contribute the maximum amount allowed by the IRS. As a result, this amount can fluctuate depending on current IRS regulations. The best part about it is that the money that is contributed to the TSP account is not taxed, allowing individuals to contribute slightly more than $17,000 a year free of taxes. Furthermore, the government will match the amount of money that is contributed by the employee. Typically, the amount that is matched dollar for dollar is approximately 2% but in some cases, more money can be contributed by the government as long as a greater percentage is contributed by the individual employee. For individuals that qualify and that contribute an amount that corresponds accordingly, the government may contribute as much as 5% to the account on an annual basis. In addition, individuals can sometimes have more than one TSP account. For example, a person that has previously worked as a uniformed officer and now works in another capacity for the federal government can actually have two separate ESP accounts that work independently from each other.

TSP Allocations During Employment
One of the most unique things about a Thrift Savings Plan is that TSP Allocations can be accessed during employment, through loans and withdrawals. Employees have the opportunity to withdraw certain funds from their TSP account while they are employed in order to cover additional expenses that they may have for things such as major home renovations, auto repairs or anything else that incurs an unexpected expense on their part. By the same token, they may also qualify for loans that are based on the money that is in the TSP account. While they still have to pay the money back, this can be far more convenient than having to get a loan through some other resource in order to get the amount of money that is needed to pay for something unexpected.

TSP Investing
TSP investing is rather flexible, providing a wide range of opportunities for individuals to find a method of investing that works well for them. When it comes to personal investing, there are five different individual funds that can be accessed.

The I Fund, as it is known, is used to invest in the International Stock Index
The S Fund is used for Small Capitalization Stock
The G Fund is utilized to invest in Government Securities
The C Fund is for the Common Stock Index
The F Fund is the Fixed Income Index
Individuals also have the opportunity to invest with Lifecycle Funds. These funds are tailored towards individuals planning on beginning their retirement on a set date. Once the individual choses the fund, they are suppose to set it and forget it. The portfolio is allocated among the 5 individuals in order to provide the optimal portfolio.

During Retirement
When a person that has a TSP account makes the decision to retire, there are several options available. The money can be rolled over into a traditional IRA account. In this respect, a TSP account is much like a traditional 401(k). Furthermore, an individual has the option of receiving a single lump sum payment from their TSP account or they can receive monthly payments for a predetermined amount of time. It is up to the individual to determine the best method to receive payments from their account during their retirement. In addition, the amount of money that is available will depend largely on the type of investing that a person has done throughout their career and how much money has been made from those investments.",1

Instead of actually shorting things, which is difficult and risky, it seems like the thing to do is to buy an ETF that shorts things. For example, [FXP](http://www.proshares.com/funds/fxp.html). All it does is bet against the iShares FTSE China ETF (large and mid-cap, including almost 200 stocks). It's been going down relentlessly, from over 150 five years ago to 28 today.

Commodities are starting to trend upward and are more promising than ever. Investors are continually annoyed by the zero gains the markets have provided for them and with it oil &amp; gold are both up. Rising oil prices signal a boost to the U.S. shale industry, and gold going up could mean a weaker dollar. Currency traders and investors of energy companies should take note.

The three big Asian markets are all down. The Nikkei 225 at -.25%, Hang Seng a big -1.12% drop, and the Shanghai Composite down -.15%. The Hang Seng bear markets were lead by China Shenhua with a close to 4% drop, and Bankcomm down 3.36%. The MSCI's delay on inclusion of Chinese stocks lead the downfall, they believe they are not ready. More data is also showing a sputtering economy with little room for its past rapid growth as vehicle sales fall. The Nikkei was dragged down by transportation and automotive companies with West Japan Railway, Toyota, Isuzu, and Hino Motors all down over 2% (Hino Motors down a staggering 4.25%).

European markets show a positive trend after being shaky for a couple months now. FTSE is up .4%, DAX 1.17%, and CAC 40 .67%. Deutsche Post is leading the DAX rally, going up 2.3% and still increasing. Tesco on the FTSE is up over 4% after coming down from a 52 week high of 298 to now 210. Greek talks are still unclear, and a resolution is not exactly imminent. 

S&amp;P 500 and Dow futures followed Europe's trend with both up over .3%. The green numbers might be as a result of investor's moving over from overvalued bonds to equities once again. Pimco Total Return Fund, a bond fund, has sold billions of dollars in U.S. debt.

On a more micro level Fiat Chrysler's CEO calls investors to push for a GM merger. Bayer is also selling their diabetes unit to Panasonic for $1.15 billion. Target announced a share buyback program, something that Goldman Sachs' CEO has warned against. Share buyback according to him was not the smart move, but leaving money for mergers &amp; acquisitions would be a better strategy. Spotify could be a huge IPO as its fierce competition with Apple is escalating, and is now valued at $8.2 billion.

I have about 1,200 in my checking and $1,300 worth invested in a medical company, ENTL. I believe they will go up soon.
My loans are deferred since I'm in graduate school, for at least 1 more year, perhaps 2, which means I can pay off my loans as if they are not getting interest and I have no obligations to start making monthly payments until the deferment ends.
At this moment I'm going to start paying off at around 100 or 150 a month, unless someone can convince me otherwise.
But my question that will not have an absolute answer is what should I do with the investment? 
Should I take it out now to put towards the loans, wait for it to grow (i strongly believe at least 20% within 6 months) and then use it to pay, or simply leave it for later? it is essentially my savings at this point.

15-06-10,39ckti,Data on EDGAR filings and governance measures of American companies.,"Dear investors, 

I am a university student currently writing my master thesis in behavioral finance, specifically examining the American market for mergers and acquisitions between 2000-2014, where the behavioral aspect focuses on CEO power and level of confidence. 

In the process of gathering the data for my analysis I have run into a bit of a pickle. I had initially hoped that my university would be able to provide me with access to all the databases that I would need. However, the WRDS access I am provided with does not subscribe to the vendors that have the data I need. The variables I am examining can be found in SEC's EDGAR database, in the company proxy filings and form 4 of insider trading. The data can be collected manually, but it is a daunting and time consuming task seeings as I am collecting data on 2500 individual acquisitions. 

I therefore turn to this forum in the hope that someone will be able to refer me to alternative databases (free or paid) in which I can be able to obtain historic values for the following:  


Power variables: 

* Total board size
* Total number of independent directors
* CEO duality (both CEO and Chairman of the board)
* Tenure
* Shares beneficially owned
* Company shares outstanding (Or % of shares owned combined with the former bullet)
* Founder of the company dummy

Confidence variables: 
I am examining the CEO behavior in regards to purchase/sales of company stock as well as exercising of options in the company. Therefore, I need a database that will provide me with an overview of CEO form 4 filings. 

I have tried to get in touch with Thomson Reuters to inquire about access to the Risk Management databases or ASSET4 database and Insider database, but without luck. The same goes for the ISS dataabase in WRDS. 

I know this is probably not the typical type of post for this forum, but I figured many of you have experience with gathering and analyzing data from the EDGAR database. If any of you have any pieces of advise it is much appreciated. 

Have a pleasant day.

15-06-11,39ei2y,5 Tips For Landlords,"Everyone knows that property is one of the most popular forms of investment. Unlike shares, bonds, trusts etc. property has an extra safety-net in that people will always need somewhere to live. That said, this by no means guarantees that any property investment is a good one. House prices fluctuate, as do the rental returns – not to mention the fact that mortgage interest rates are also variable.
All things considered, property remains high on the list of possible investments for many and perhaps one of the biggest factors in making the investment a success is – THE TENANTS! Here are five tips for potential buy to let property investors:
 
Always Use a Contract
When you are first setting out in the property investment world, it can be tempting to cut corners to save a few pounds. Furthermore, you may already have possible tenants in mind; friends, family or even work colleagues. I previously lived with another couple back at University in my friends house and things actually got pretty ugly when it was time to leave. The other couple had informally agreed to live there for 6 months and wanted to leave after 4. There was no contract in place between ‘friends’ and as a consequence the friendship was no more – Don’t mix business with pleasure if possible.
Others will try and wrangle their way out of contracts on technicalities. In the UK a number of ‘standard’ contracts exist, so you won’t have to pay a lawyer to write one from scratch and solicitor’s rates can actually be pretty reasonable. If you want to save more money, you can actually download one of the tenancy agreements online and edit it yourself – although it might be an idea to have a lawyer check it over.
 
Get the Mortgage Overpayments Right
When you are investing in property, it can be tempting to get too carried away with the numbers. While paying of your mortgage(s) early is a great idea in principle, ensure that you don’t set yourself up for a fall. Reduced term mortgaged (15 years instead of 25 years for example) are very popular, but can also get you into deep water if the interest rates rise or your property goes through a period of being empty. Check with your mortgage provider, but you can often make overpayments within a given limit (usually 10% of the balance) without paying a penalty. This way, you can take a 25 year mortgage and overpay as and when you can afford to – you are not obligated to meet the higher monthly repayments.
 
Have a Contingency Fund
Unlike with stock and shares, an investment in property often requires ‘topping up’ to ensure that it continues to provide a sizable return. Curtains, carpets, walls, furniture, gardens etc. all need repairing and fixing at some point. Many landlords will charge tenants from their security deposit if they are directly responsible for the breakage of something, but soft furnishings all get tired with time. It might be a good idea to keep a ‘spares and repairs account‘ for the unexpected replacement of an appliance or to help you pay the mortgage if there is a gap between tenants.
 
Use an Agency or Do It Yourself?
The temptation when buying property as an investment is to think that you can manage it all by yourself. As your empire starts to grow, the demand on your time will also increase. Agencies charge a small fee, but can take care of many of the tedious tracks in the process. You don’t want a criminal or somebody who was evicted for trashing their last flat moving right into yours do you? Agencies can provide background checks for a fee – which you can usually pass on to the tenants and also take care of any midnight call-outs – not to mention finding the tenants in the first place!
 
Ensure That You are Insured
While this might seem blatantly obvious, it is by far the most important consideration of the lot. In my five years experience of being a student, I know of at least two groups of people who caused a fire and had to move out while the fire damage was repaired. Taking the toaster into your bedroom when you are blitzed may seem like a good idea at the time; but bed covers and heating elements don’t go well together! Many specialist companies like CIA Insurance can offer policies and advice to ensure that you have the right level of cover. The last thing that any property investor wants is to owe the bank a mortgage for a property that was destroyed. Fire is not the only force that can be of detriment to your rental – flooding, mold or disastrous tenants can all cause your property value to plummet!

I got into $AOI at 2.32 during my lunch and set a stop at 2.27. I wasn't sure if I had showed up to late to the party or not. I watched it get up to the low 2.40s and finally break through the ASK 214 2.44 and get up to 2.46. I thought I changed my stop to a trailing stop at -.05 MARK when my lunch was over in the hopes it would climb higher. I don't know if I didn't confirm the trailing stop, set it up wrong or it didn't take effect because I already had a stop. The stock peaked at 2.52 so if I had set my trailing stop correctly I would have sold somewhere around 2.44-2.47 giving me a nice little gain. Instead it dropped and hit my hard stop at 2.27 giving me a loss while I was working.

My questions are if I have a stop do I need to cancel it before I can make a trailing stop or was it operator error?

15-06-10,39d6ff,An Intriguing GoPro Opportunity in eSports and Web Cameras: A Letter to GoPro,"tl;dr: GoPro should create brand awareness in eSports through marketing and product opportunities. I believe these to be  accretive to shareholder value through long-run revenue growth, product diversification, and margin stabilization.
--------
Dear GoPro Management, 

I am writing to suggest that GoPro penetrate the eSports market by developing a product line for web-cameras and generating brand awareness.  I believe this to be a revenue growth opportunity for GoPro since the eSports market is showing favorable overall market trends, is well-aligned to the existing GoPro consumer demographic, and would be synergistic to the GoPro brand in action sports.  

The eSports market shows promising signs of growth with 89 million enthusiasts in 2014 and projected growth to 145 million in 2017 [1].  Of those enthusiasts, many are choosing to not only consume but also produce content in the online marketplace.  Much in the same way that GoPro’s software investments seek to capture enthusiasm for content generation and sharing to drive product loyalty, the eSports market is a similar engagement opportunity for web-cameras. 

I think that any eSports gamer with a desktop computer is a potential GoPro web-camera consumer.  eSports gaming relies on desktop computers due to needs for enhanced video processing and cooling capabilities relative to laptops.  Although overall trends in the desktop computer industry point to declining sale volumes, the number of consumers using high-end desktops as gaming platforms is actually increasing (along with the corresponding web-camera opportunity) [2]. It should be noted that there is currently no major eSports web-camera sponsor or web-camera producer with a majority market share in eSports.

Competitive online video gamers who produce and sell content possess promising demographics for a GoPro web-camera product line - they are largely young, affluent, and male. A GoPro web-camera product line consumed by this demographic would both induce uptake in the web-camera consumption of casual gamers while also creating a similar spillover dynamic for the demographic’s GoPro action camera, software, and media consumption.  A presence in the eSports market would also generate further global brand awareness due to the industry’s global reach in the EMEA and APAC regions.  

To enter the growing eSports scene, GoPro could pursue a strategy parallel to its original introduction and marketing in the action sports market. For instance, there are several sponsorship opportunities to pursue for both tournaments and leagues with high eSports visibility. Some of these include The League of Legends Championship Series (LCS), The International, and Major League Gaming, all of which command viewership in the high-hundreds of thousands and sometimes millions of unique viewers [3]. Additionally, popular teams like Optic Gaming and Evil Geniuses capture several championships a year and their players command tens of thousands of viewers while they stream casually on Twitch.tv. The opportunities for product placement and brand awareness in each marketing vertical is immense.   

I would suggest developing a product line that would sell with MSRPs of $99, $149, and $199. Potential avenues for product differentiation include resolution, frame rate, and audio capabilities. With the current distribution channels, I would estimate, conservatively, first year sales of approximately 250,000 units at an ASP of $149 with similar margin profiles to the existing action camera product line [4]. This conservative estimate is based on penetrating 0.25% of the current esports market (consumption by competitive gamers and casual spectators) and should contribute approximately $37 million in additional revenue. The resulting incremental top-line growth in the GoPro action cameras and software is arguably indeterminable, but would without a doubt be positively material due to the strengthening of the GoPro brand.

As a GoPro shareholder, I am thrilled with the firm’s expansion into consumer quadcopters and virtual reality. While I applaud these efforts, I believe further opportunities exist in eSports web cameras that would be accretive to shareholder value through long-run revenue growth, product diversification, and margin stabilization. I understand I do not have access to all necessary information, and I trust your professional judgement for product development and marketing strategies. Nonetheless, I believe web-cameras should be a relatively easy pivot from past and present product development efforts, while aligning perfectly with existing management structures and objectives.  

Regards,

GrocklesPhotoRod*

Note: I have reviewed the GoPro suggestions policy and disclaimers on the website and affirm that I expect no payment or acknowledgment of any kind for this proposal.

15-06-11,39epeq,How To Avoid BS Promotion Tactics,"The whole point of any Promotion is to get the person hyped. Basically to convince you that whatever you are getting is the ""next big thing"". I am personally not a trader that likes to gamble on this kind of stuff, because it is almost always wrong. Since there appears to be a new wave of traders on this subreddit, I immediately see people relying wayyyyy to much on fundamentals for stocks that have no fundamentals. Charts IMO tell you WAY more in pennystocks then any fundamentals ever will. Example: Some article comes out about an OTC pennystock that is amazing news! Well guess what, if you look back in the stocks history it has been sitting at an extremely cheap price forever and has been doing this little ""promo tactic"" forever. Basically pumping and dumping their stock through their press releases.

**Here are a few tips to avoid falling for this garbage:**
-----
1. **The old newsletter pump**- Not as common anymore, but it can still be found occasionally and will see HUGE stock spikes over a short period of time. Obviously this kind of stuff NEVER lasts. They are 99% of the time inside of cheap OTC stocks, because they are the easiest to manipulate. Here is a quick websearch of them: http://i.imgur.com/BMbpTSz.png Finding websites that help you find this garbage is easy. Back when I traded OTC I used: https://stockpromoters.com/ . It was by far the best website.

2. **Article Fluff**- A lot more common and you will find it in pretty much every market. Some stocks will release these insanely sugar coated PR reports. They are usually describing how great the news is by carefully wording things. Example: ""WE DOUBLED IN REVENUE!!!!"" But in reality spent about 5 times the amount of money to do so, and have doubled their net loss. That is just a basic example, obviously the most common ones are bio companies releasing PR about FDA approval coming.

3. My favorite: **The guru play-** Pumped by a GURU. It is more of a quick movement so it is harder to catch if you were not watching closely. Basically someone popular on twitter posts ""I got a short position on here I think it is going down"" and then the stock drops a little and squeezes out all the people that copied his trade. Saw this happen the other day with a guy name Tim on twitter (will not name his last name, doesn't start with an S). Trading around it is easy; don't follow them. Others use ""watchlists"" (newsletters) to exploit a stocks movement.

4. Last but not least: **The billionaire bought it-** I believe it was VLTC that had some billionaire buyer. It ended up squeezing so many shorts that it decupled in price. Too many people on investing subreddits in general just buy or short stocks just because some big named guy buys it. I just can't follow what these people are doing. I have noticed when everyone is thinking one thing in the stock market, the opposite usually happens.

Also another quick thing, not related. I really do not like when people ask ""Any tips on buying XYZ stock"" or ""What stock should I buy"" because that is just being a follower. I do not know why but being a follower based on what I have seen always fucks you over. Any questions ask below! Thanks.",1

I studied the fidelity annual report (because it was the easiest one to find)
and I think it looks like it is saying that there was some interest income, and
that the NAV grew by the amount of net investment income.  So I'm thinking that
maybe there wasn't enough interest income to bother distributing it?  Various
quotes report confusing details about the yield for these, so it is a little
confusing.

Daytrade specific.
-
I short intraday. It is (in my opinion) the most fun. If i were you I would stay away from pennystocks until you have a good understanding of stockpromotion and short squeezes. If you want to do well in daytrading you should record each trade and write down where you want to get out of a stock (pretty much a mental stoploss).
Shorting intraday is not easy, you have to adapt and be ready to understand when to get into and out of a stock. Here is trade I made recently: http://i.imgur.com/aMU43pI.png?1 As you can see, I had gotten in with a set idea when I wanted to get out. I shorted because I felt the momentum has shifted and I looked for a opportunity to get in. This is in my opinion the most important aspect in a daytrader

Also i use suretrader which bypasses the pattern daytrade rule. I think they have a good short list too (except for gene, rip)

And the scan i use (the basic version): http://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=311&amp;f=sh_curvol_o50,sh_price_u15,ta_highlow20d_nh,ta_perf2_d5o&amp;ta=0&amp;o=-volume , your choice to use it or not. Lots of traders would say ""ew those stocks suck"", i get the ones with the best setup to short. One day consider coming back to this scan once your are more experienced

When you start out, do not go in and immediatly trade. Paper trade first and record your trades, (don't lie about ur trades either, record the truth). Obvious learn all you can by reading books. Once you feel like you have a good understanding of daytrading then go ahead and try it with real money. Each trade you should get in with an idea where to cut losses and collect gains

Try to avoid doing the following:
-

You have no trading plan

**You are blindly following others because they are experts** (what i call out people on the most, and they usually refuse to listen)

No clue how to set a proper r/r

""Hope"" is part of your ""strategy""

You average down on losers 

You jump from one hot trading method to another hoping for ""the answer""

Ask for stock picks

15-06-11,39g6fm,Misfit Investing Guide,"What does it mean to be a Misfit investor?

What made us consider coining the phrase “Misfit Investor” was due to the fact that we noticed just how unwelcome or unpopular penny stock investors are. We mess up the flow of things big time for day traders, flippers, shorters and anyone else that thrives on the unstable world of the OTC. Heck, to actually say you are interested in a stock for merely more than a daily or weekly gain can make you stand out very quickly and you may just start to feel like a “Misfit”

Now on top of this to be a Misfit investor you have to also be crazy enough to love penny stocks and not run for the hills when you consider the overwhelming things that work against you such as ***Larger*** companies that can swallow up, or straight up bury little companies over night. Also unsavory firms, (that I won’t mention) that will naked short, step the price down, or basically market manage your expected intrinsic PPS to never reach what you feel it is worth.
You will also find doing your Due Diligence with OTC stocks much harder than Blue Chip stocks and Chart reading can really fly out the window due to all the other things I mentioned earlier like MM’s controlling the PPS.
So if this does not scare you away and you are still reading this because you actually love finding diamonds in the rough then maybe OTC stock investing is for you.
“”If The Business Does Well, The Stock Eventually Follows.” Warren Buffet. 

Well that is easy for Warren to say! He invests in Blue Chip stocks that are all very much regulated and mostly well respected. He also can use charts that can really lend a huge helping hand to *guesstimate* price points to buy and sell.

Warren’s style of investing is wonderful, his entire life from when he was very young was all about buying something small and investing time and effort into it to sell later on for a much bigger profit.
Warren’s pinball machine: http://dividendrealestate.com/pinball/

To be a Misfit Investor you will find yourself being the odd ball out many times. You will do tons of research others feel is wasted time and *“many experts”* will tell you charts say this and charts say that. While your DD and charts tell you many things it will mostly come down to your DD only that sets you apart from everyone else. Charts may look fantastic and the Press Release you just read for a stock is very favorable, but then your PPS slides and you wonder WTF?

 Considering that PPS in OTC realm is anywhere from .000001 to .50 as an average you can have stock that can be easily manipulated by bigger fish on the pond. Charts give you perspective, but won’t prepare you for firms that just want to cash in on good news. Intrinsic value is what you seek and that is within good management, revenue streams, and a company that tries to be transparent, communicates, but as well stays on the level that a BlueChip stock operates on.

 So transparency is great, but a PR every week is bad. Don’t get fooled by the hype and a PR is nothing if does not report to the SEC so take all press releases with a grain of salt if that company has no way to actually prove anything they are saying is true.

So why do all of this? Why not flip a trade for the 20% upside like everyone else with little risk of being burned by holding in there for long term?

Well, it comes down to personal preference. Do you like investing in a company and feel like you own a piece of something that has a chance of being something bigger.

What do I personally look for?
Stocks that may have once been on the Nasdaq, but had some turbulence and fell from grace. That is my starting point and then I search if this company has done anything to correct this fall and then research the management themselves. Trying to connect the dots can be tiring and lead to many dead ends before finding something truly you feel is a winner. You see they have several months of steady growth and they make reports that you feel are on the level. If this company just happens to report to the SEC then consider that icing on the cake!

So how do you narrow down the search from the thousands of dead end stocks that are out there?
I hate to even admit this, but places like IHUB’s top 10 message boards rate these boards by how much people post to that stock’s MB. Searching through say the top 10 to 20 can be helpful to gauge what you feel is the real deal and what is BS.
I have learned to not use IHUB for anything else so take that advice, or leave it.
Learn to read charts to get some perspective on volumes and trading ranges and even create a Gmail account to use a throw away account and sign up to all those spam OTC stock websites. Why would you do such a crazy thing? Well, being an investor in the OTC world can be downright frustrating sometimes where nothing makes sense. “Why is my stock going up on no news? &amp; Why is it going down on great news???
Sometimes just checking through these pump/bash emails can explain where the sudden volume is stirring from and will help maintain your sanity.

Make your own rules and stick to them. Always be open minded and learn new things, but don’t let someone talk you out of a stock you had your heart set on.
Why?
What would you feel worse about?
A stock you loved, but failed in and lost your initial investment, (never invest your lunch money). Or being in a stock you love and some “expert” tell you to get out before the sky falls and then a week later the stock is up 300%?

Lastly, if you ever get the chance always take a little of the top to pay your initial investment off because most likely your favorite stock will also have bad days like all other stocks and go back down a bit so be ready to buy back in for more shares with the house’s money, or just treat yourself out and maybe pay some bills. Just remember taxes still need to be paid each year so don’t spend it all.

I hope those that like investing in OTC stock found this post interesting and maybe even helped a few beginners.

Several days later I decide to sell both (on that very same day). While the stock is still unsettled it allows me to purchase another security on good faith that I will not sell it for another three days. 

Now say i want to buy back stocks A and B that same day. It's my understanding that you are allowed to purchase 'another' security with the unsettled funds. Are you allowed to re-purchase the same security with the funds available (sell stock A, buy stock A again). If not, can you purchase Stock A with the unsettled funds of B and Stock B with the unsettled funds with A?

I am wondering if I should stick with the index funds even though their expense ratios are almost as high as the actively managed funds.  I know that after expenses, most actively managed funds fail to beat the indexes, but since the fee disparity is closer than usual, would it be more tempting to go actively managed?  If so, which funds would you recommend?
 
If indexes are still the way to go, I was planning on mimicking the vanguard target fund 2050 (I'm 29 years old) and going

Punch TV Studios Announces $50 Million Raise for its First Round of Funding

A photo accompanying this release is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/prs/?pkgid=33432

""By allowing the public to invest directly into Punch TV Studios, it is now possible for urban investors to become stockholders and active participants in our success. It is of the utmost importance that we are able to empower the members of the urban community, who before the JOBS Act would not have had this opportunity,"" says CEO Joseph Collins.

Potential investors should register at http://www.PunchTVStudios.com to be among the first to purchase Punch TV Studios stock, as the company begins to test the waters in states that are applicable. Punch TV Studios plans to immediately begin selling its shares after the Securities Exchange Commission issues an effective date. The stock is now available to qualified investors by contacting Punch TV Studios directly at investor-relations@punchtvstudios.com.

Punch TV Studios investor, and former US Naval Academy Professor of Finance Dr. Betty Burston PhD, states that ""Punch TV Studios is one of those amazing, cutting edge start-ups that is emerging from the shadows and transforming into a media juggernaut, a transition reminiscent of the early days of Apple, Walt Disney or Microsoft.""

The $50 million capital raise will effectively position the company for the launch of its new global app ""Punch TV Live."" The Punch TV Live app will include multiple independent television networks streaming live 24 hours per day. Punch TV Live is scheduled for release in the first quarter of 2016.

""According to our business model, after successfully raising $50 million, we are projected to generate more than $100 million in annual revenues, and create more than 500 new jobs over the next three years. We are determined to transform the urban community into an unstoppable force,"" says CEO Joseph Collins.

15-06-12,39kmkq,Feeling in over my head,"Hi all. Long time lurker first time posting. 

A couple of years ago I started putting money in an online brokerage account.  I started investing just a little here and there to see if I could make some extra money.  I mostly have a mix of ETFs covering broad sectors, and also a bond ETF. 

At first investing was a hobby of sorts. However it turned out my timing was impeccable. My investments did very well, so I kept putting more and more money into it. 
 
Fast forward a couple of years and the amount I have in my account is no longer chump change.  Now I'm starting to feel overwhelmed. Some of my investments are doing great and others (like my corporate bond fund)  not so much.   Plus I have no idea what to do when the market starts to tank. 

Right now my strategy is to do nothing while the value of my overall portfolio continues to grow. In the mean time I am reading about valuation. But this is clearly not a long term strategy. 

Anyone else gone through this in the past? Suggestions? Thanks!

15-06-12,39kyvm,The 7 Rules to #Yolo,"If you truly are serious about being a trader then there are seven things that you will have to accept.

1. You will have to accept that over the long term all of your trades will be winners. ALWAYS HOLD OPTIONS UNTIL EXPIERY.  The CEO always leaves when you have money on the line.  

2. Accept that the key to being a successful trader is having big wins and no losses.  Big bets can lead quickly to you winning the game after a string of losses.

3. Accept that the best traders don't risk manage.  The best traders have HUGE crystal balls so they NEVER manage their capital at risk.  CRISTAL BALLS SO BIG THEY DONT FIT IN YOUR SCOTCH GLASS.  

4. If you want to continue being the best trader then you need to accept that trading larger and more risky is a key to your continued success. Risking 100% to 200% of your capital on any single trade is the first step to winning at trading. Not using stops and position sizing is fundamental.  BROKERS DONT GIVE YOU MARGIN TO NOT USE IT.

5. You must accept that you will have never have trading losses in a row.  The question is what your account will look like when they happen and when to DOUBLE DOWN.  GET THAT KFC FRIED CHICKEN WITH EXTRA BACON.  

6. You have to accept that you will be right, a lot.  The sooner you accept you are right and change your mind the better off you will be.

7. If you really want to be a trader then you are going to have to accept the fact that trading is easy money. It is a profession like any other and requires no work and effort and even HOURS to become proficient. Expect to GET PAID and CHARGE OTHERS FOR ADVISE

Why? Refineries. Refining companies like Valero, Suncor, and Marathon know that people will still buy gasoline at whatever the fuck price they want to charge for it. This has resulted in some (huge) profit margins for refiners, margins that won't get reported until Q2/Q3.

When someone is consistently saying: ""it will drop news!"" ""It will be the next big thing""""It is a great stock""""It is amazing"" repeating himself over and over is pumping. I think when someone is THAT pushed to convince you that it is a good investment, they are pumping or just hyping themselves. I have no problem with anyone going around saying this stock is great, just don't make it obvious that you are trying to pump it. For example: people talk about some random OTC .000001 worth of a stock and I just ignore it now, it isn't worth my time to bother. But if they keep reporting the same ticker over and over I will begin to question why they are doing so. There was  a user that loved to spam PZOO and was saying it was the next big thing, needless to say he was wrong. Also just because everyone else is saying one thing, doesn't mean you have to follow it. This ""herd"" mentality in the stock market is super bad and I see too many people get trapped into it.

Proof....:
-

Bold claims are only the beginning of it. One of his old posts was this:

&gt; .40, a likely $2.10

He is basically saying the stock is going to go up a whopping **425%!** Wow sounds legit! Ok seriously, no one believes this and I am sure most of you already know. I am just making this post for anyone that doesn't know what a promoter does and how he works. He can deny deny deny all he wants but in reality it is pumping. Remember that PZOO pumper? What happened to him? He probably was a bag holder and held that thing into the ground, after so many bold claims.


Next: http://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/36t5x3/valuating_elite_pharmaceuticals/crhdx98

&gt;It's going to get approved, I am 100% certain of this **so not pumping at all.**

He says that the phase 3 data WILL BE APPROVED?!?!?? Hmmm not according to what he linked. He said in his post: http://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/395nzf/elite_pharmaceuticals_news/
&gt;Elite also announced today the dosing of the first subjects for an ELI-200 Phase III clinical study.

The ""so not pumping at all"" part makes literally no sense, he was very quick to deny it. (like most pumpers)

 A quick thing you can do to prove they are pumpers is to question historical data on a stock. Most of the time a stock that they are attempting to pump (or just hype themselves up on) has a garbage history and still is garbage. Here is a good post by another user about a month ago:
http://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/36t5x3/valuating_elite_pharmaceuticals/crhov1g

&gt;So - it could be that they've been spending investors money on researching new products and those products are going to turn around and make a ton of money for the company (any day now!), or it could be that the R&amp;D is a cover for bilking investors. I honestly can't say; I'm not saying that it IS, what I'm saying is that so far they're poured a lot of money into ""R&amp;D"" and their profits (so far) **don't reflect substantial gains.** Their R&amp;D expense in 2014 more than tripled what it was in 2013 but their profits went up maybe 20%? So yeah, it's possible that they're on the verge of releasing an amazing new product that is going to sell like gangbusters, and investing now is going to result in amazing returns. But it might be another 2 years away. Or another company might beat them to the punch. There's a LOT of unknowns here, this is anything but a sure thing (there never are).
IF the company isn't a scam, it's still a straight up gamble of an investment, and one that you might not see returns on for years. 

Here is the post I am referring to, the user is consistently trying to pump the stock forever now and it is just annoying at this point: http://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/36t5x3/valuating_elite_pharmaceuticals/

and here: http://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/395nzf/elite_pharmaceuticals_news/

annnnnd here:
http://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/39hqbe/eltp_about_to_drop_news/

Why did I make this post? To clear things up. Honestly, I am very tired of seeing people defending an obvious pumper and it bothers me that they think they know better. I will tell everyone not to invest into OTC stocks because lets face it, it is gambling. Especially when your source of info is some random article.

15-06-12,39lrpc,Investment Idea - 17% Locked In,"I call this my easy money trade because you can make 17% in 3 weeks via a tender offer for Global Net Lease (GNL) stock.

Global Net Lease is a private REIT that got NYSE listed last week. What they do is not important however. This trade is an arbitrage on the odd-lot feature of their recently launched tender.

That is, for holders with 99 shares (or less), they can buy the stock at 9.00 today, tender them, and make 17% in 3 weeks. The company has plenty of liquidity to execute the tender, and odd-lot holders have priority.

So how does it work?

Step 1: Buy 99 Shares of GNL. Do not buy more than 99 shares.

Step 2: After your trade has closed (in 2-3 days), tender your shares by calling your broker. Tell them to tender your GNL stock.

Step 3: Next, tell your broker to check the “Odd-Lot” box. This should be automatic, but cannot hurt.
This should take less than 10 minutes of time, and is a free $150 (or 17%) in 3 weeks. Enjoy!

I have a stable job and bartending side job also which creates more cash flow for myself but will break down the different areas of my money.  I am looking at moving my American Century account to Vanguard funds over the next couple weeks but figured I might as well lay out everything to see any extra feedback.

$5,000 - 401k through Principal

                 I contribute 10% pre-tax and get match 1/2 of 6% so basically 3%

$43,000 - Sharebuilder Investments

                These include. aapl, aal, luv, cern, lvs, bac, wfm, and a few other companies I like

$28,500 - American Century (Investor using advisor with Northwestern Mutual)

               Started this with 12,000 in 2009 contribute $50 a month but want to put more into it while having control without paying 1% plus.  $11,000 of this is my Roth IRA.  Wanting to slide more into roth and transfer both of these accounts to Vanguard.

$9,000 - Cash/Savings

$4,000 - Savings/Checking

(-) $3,000 - Student Loan 3.3% My last student loan!! Paid off most of all my debt this last year and not overly concerned with this being such a low rate.



I know I am able to rollover my Roth IRA to Vanguard easily however I have a Strategic Allocation fund with Capital Gains re-investment so not sure how that will affect me.  I assume I would have to cash that account out to transfer since it is a Specific American Century Investment Account?

15-06-12,39jk3d,Applying structured settlements concept for divorce negotiations,"Whenever a divorce happens, all of sudden the financial condition of a spouse comes under the microscope and it has been observed that more often than not there is not a guarantee of a stable income and there have been instances where things went out of control to say the least. The source of income post a divorce is often seen to be inconsistent without having a good reliance of meeting the financial needs of the spouse. There had been numerous fake promises which were committed by the payee with no concrete actions whatsoever. However, this kind of situations could be easily avoided with the help of structured settlements. What that will do is it will not only guarantee the spouse with a consistent source of income in periodic intervals but also make sure that the spouse gets all the benefits which were being promised by the payee at the time of divorce.

Beneficial for both the parties

The best thing in applying structured settlements for divorce negotiation is the fact that it is beneficial for both the payee as well as the receiver. Some of the advantages have been listed below for your reference:

Benefits for receivers:  The biggest benefit for a receiver is the sense of security it brings in divorce negotiations. You can free yourselves from all kinds of worries because you will get all the things which you. The payments will be contractually guaranteed with no market risks tied to them. The mode of payment will be flexible and will be distributed in long intervals.

Benefits for payees:  After a divorce, the payees would not like to remain in touch with the receiver and they try every means to maintain distance because divorce is always a very nasty affair to deal with. Having structured settlements as a part of the divorce process, you can free yourselves from any kind of attachment from your ex-spouse. You can also save a lot of money if you resort to making this kind of a settlement in a structured manner.

The process

A structured settlement in divorce negotiations usually is a very simple process and there is no rocket science involved in it.  A settlement planner plays an extremely critical role in such settlements and the financial advisor gets in touch with him in order to have a seamless settlement. The planner discusses all the pros and cons which are associated with the process of divorce and what his/her needs for future are.  The spouse is also made aware about the consequences of taxes associated with such a settlement. The best aspect of having a settlement planner work on behalf of you is that there isn’t any additional cost involved in it and you can avail the services free of co

Once the process of paying in parts is over, the Payee decides whether or not the payment should be a periodic one or a lump sum one. The agreement which allows the payer spouse to make periodic payments is known as Marital Settlement Agreement.  An assignment company is selected and the payee transfers the lump sum amount with discounted rates. It is extremely important to reach out to an assignment company because this will eventually help you to save a lot of taxes in the long run.

Application of structured settlements in divorce negotiations

Now that you are through with the process your next step is to know exactly where structured settlements have the greatest of impacts in divorce negotiations. Following are some of them:

Martial assets can be evenly segregated: The advantage of such a settlement over divorce is that the financial assets between husband and wife get evenly distributed and there is no room for disputes afterwards. Both are clear about their assets and hence there is a lesser scope of a debate between the two parties.

Child share: The share of child has always been a very debatable affair in cases of divorce and it is only through structured settlement you can expect to have a comparatively smoother ride. This kind of settlement covers almost all attributes related to a child post divorce starting from tax benefits.

You are aware about your savings and earnings: This kind of settlement gives you ample opportunity to know about your savings as well as earnings out of a divorce and it is not at all complicated.

Conclusion

Therefore, as you can see , in today’s age where divorce rates are on the rise, structured settlements are a boon to those couples who are on the verge of separation and don’t know exactly how to streamline things. Following such a settlement scheme not only helps to have a smooth divorce process but also helps you to maintain a healthy relationship with your ex-spouse in future.",1

15-06-12,39jsph,Challenge: can you find your long-term account performance (7 years returns or since inception) on your advisor/broker website? (it isnt always easy),"+ Who/what site do you use??

I've found that most brokerage websites make it really hard to see your long term performance numbers (for obvious reasons).  I have only seen a few though (Charles Schwab and Morgan Stanley) and I was hoping you guys could help me by telling me if/how your advisor/broker displays your long-term performance (returns).
 
2. Is there any way for you to download a series of returns (monthly?) in a spreadsheet?
3. Can you see the account risk statistics?

For example, Morgan Stanley doesnt display any of this, while Charles Schwab displays cumulative returns and risk stats.

In full disclosure I'm hoping to set up an independent portfolio performance review website to help people determine if their advisor/broker is helping them or ripping them off.

This is an australian bio-tech company that already has an **approved product in the EU**. It is trading like a phase I company. The product has a side effect **that makes people tan**.

Can you believe it? **Imagine the off-label use**. It will be priced like an orphan drug given the small market. Dateline is airing a special on Sunday for EPP (the indication it is approved for in the EU) which will feature the drug.

The drug helps with more than EPP and more than tanning. It is in phase II trials for Vitiligo in Singapore and has also been shown to help with a host of other inflammation based diseases. **Even ignoring the tanning effect of this barbie drug it will be a billion dollar company**.

The drug is extremely safe. It has already been used in Italy / Sweden for 4+ years with no-adverse effects. They are currently working on a topical lotion for mass market (current drug is implant based).

**This baby is going to be worth billions over the next several years**

- interested in best way to trade for someone like me (apps, stockbroker etc)

- interested in best types of stock for someone young like me (more interested in higher risk?)

Would I be better off holding onto my money in a high interest bank account or to start trading small? I have very minimal expenses at the minute but that will grow once I move off college next year.

**EDIT:** 

I'm getting around $250 a month in income and paying $62 a month for a phone contract

**EDIT 2:** 

Okay so I appreciate all the comments, its a lot to take in, however some people cant seem to properly grasp my situation. Yes my income is low, yes I am spending a huge amount on a phone contract but that isn't the issue. I'm being supported by my family so money isn't an issue, its more the fact that I have some spare for everyday expenses. Most of my peers aren't even working in conjunction with uni study and many have close to no savings either.

I am not worried in using up all my money because of the support I have so ideally all my savings are disposable however I would like to hold on to $500 or so for emergencies.

It's also probably worth noting I live in Australia so trading and costs might be a little different here.

15-06-14,39rycg,Should we be a lot more skeptical about the buy-and-hold approach to stock investing once we take into account survivorship bias?,"Most people in /r/investing are American and also have very strong faith in the buy-and-hold approach to stock market investing. I think this is not mere coincidence.

The belief in buy-and-hold seems to be based on long-run studies of stock returns in the US (which you can find in popular investing books by people like Burton Malkiel and Jeremy Siegel). But consider that fact that the US has been arguably the most successful capitalist system in world.

My numbers are somewhat dated, but a study by Jorion and Goetzmann of 39 stock markets over 1921-1996 found that the US had the highest real return at 4.3% versus a median of 0.8% for other countries. So the US returns over the long-run seem very much to be the exception rather than the rule.

I don't see the extreme belief in buy-and-hold investing in stocks in most other countries (except maybe the UK, Australia, Sweden). Perhaps redditors from Japan, Russia, and Germany can comment.

Some might think that the US has a great capitalist system and that the good times will keep rolling. But how could we have known standing in 1900 or 1921 that out of all the countries in the world, the US would have been as successful as it turned out to be? Likewise how do we know going forward that the US will have similar success? And if conditions in the US are so good, then investors should be willing to accept LOWER returns (just as they expect higher returns in risker emerging markets). The odds seem very much against the US stock market having the #1 returns again out of all countries over the next say 100 years.

Are we placing too much focus on our ex-post, super successful return history in the US? And does this mean that we should have a lot less faith that buy-and-holding stocks for the long-run in the US will provide future returns anywhere close to what the US has experienced in the past?",9

&gt;It has an already FDA approved (reduces a ton of risk) for a sepsis and bacteria testing device. Its device will become the gold standard of testing in hospitals as it requires no blood culture.

First sentence right here shows the OP didn't read a single study on what they're investing in. **If you can't read a study, don't invest in healthcare.** Shit, if you can't read the *name* of the device that's been FDA approved, don't invest in Healthcare (or anything really). 

&gt;Do your DD, I can't find much downside.... There are a ton of good articles on seekingalpha yet it's still relatively undiscovered in the investment community

A word of advice: *Seeking Alpha is not Due Diligence.* 

T2Candida is T2Biosystem's only FDA approved device that can test for infections. T2Dx is also FDA approved and is the platform that makes testing possible, but it alone can't conclude any diagnosis. 

So why is OP from the other thread wrong? Candida, **which is in the fucking name of the device**, is a Fungemia; a fungal infection in the blood stream. Candida is the strain that accounts for almost all cases of Fungemia, and T2Candida tests for 5 specific strains of Candidemia (because Candida is so common in Fungemia they're sometimes used interchangeably). 

So this company is not testing for Bacteremia. TTOO's bacteria panel, T2Bacteria, hasn't even begun clinical trials. Aka it is *not* FDA approved. As of right now TTOO's pool of marketable consumers is [8-10 cases per 100,000 people.](http://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/candidiasis/invasive/statistics.html) 

The competition for T2Candida is weak, yes, but the patient pool for Candidemia is nowhere near the patient pool for Bacteremia. Candidemia: 8-10 per 100,000 people; Bacteremia: *300* per 100,000 people. 

To reach a significant consumer base TTOO would need to begin and complete their T2Bacteria panel clinical trials. If you're willing to wait at least 2 years for a CHANCE at FDA approval, then yes you should probably invest. You should also try throwing your money in the air hoping more falls down.

* The company is selling it to me for the ""discounted"" price of $0.75 per common stock
* Not willing to disclose how many total shares there are
* Mid-sized tech start-up
* Not public traded
* Has been around since 2006
* On Glassdoor, it says the company makes a yearly revenue of $10-25 million, and has around 100-500 people

15-06-14,39uig3,Expense ratio vs. returns.,"So I've been investing solely in Vanguard funds because of the fantastic expense ratios they have, but I was talking to my parents recently and they were telling me about the T. Rowe Price Health Sciences fund which had gotten them some pretty big returns. It's closed now so I took a look at some of the best performing Health Sciences funds right now and the performances look great. The 5 year chart has one at 26.6% annually, and the one year was 37.2%! The expense ratio is 0.74.

That's obviously much higher than most vanguard funds, but it seems like it's probably worth it if you've got a fund performing at that level consistently. What do people think?

tl;dr - If a fund is consistently giving 25-35% returns annually, does it make sense to branch out from the low-cost Vanguard funds?",0

Thanks for all the great responses just to sum up what I have read at least how I understand it for those reading this later.  - Focus on market cap rather than just share price.  - Stock splitting lowers share prices some companies do it regularly others do not.  - The amount of shares is directly correlated to the share price. More shares dilutes the share price making it lower while the overall value of the company could be much higher than a company with a higher single share price.,48

15-06-14,39uopu,"$AEZS, $HERO, and $JOEZ. Also, alcohol and a story.","*Recently, some guy was unhappy that people in this subreddit rarely ever post an actual analysis of the stocks they recommend. Personally, I think he has a point, but I'm sure as hell not going to try to improve anything. :D Instead, have a story with no(?) redeeming value.*



It was a typical Saturday evening for me, which meant a visit to the nearby noodle shop in my neighborhood. It's the sort of family-owned dive where the food is cheap, yet surprisingly good, and the clientele look like young people with little money, and yet surprisingly… well, no, there's no surprise, they really are just young people with little money. Anyways, places like this have their own unique smell; the air was thick with the smell of barbecue, cooking oil, and a little of that special blend of alcohol and unwashed clothing.

Actually, I'm pretty sure those last two odours were really only due to one person, and to my dismay, that person happened to be the one sitting across the table from me. He turned to me, glassy, bloodshot eyes staring in a way that alternated between troubled and unfocused.

*This could be bad*, I thought. You ever have that friend who seems a little odd when they're sober, but then turns completely unpredictable when they get drunk? This was that friend, and right now, it was just him and me. Oh, and a bunch of college students who were younger than either of us, but who cares about them?

""I have-,"" he paused, his words slurred. ""I have something to tell you.""

""Myungsoo,"" I addressed him. ""On a scale of 1 to Lindsay Lohan, how drunk are you right now?""

Myungsoo ignored my question (typical). He leaned closer, subjecting me further to that smell of alcohol and soap-deficient clothing, and said in an exaggerated whisper, ""**$AEZS** is at $0.28. It's pretty volatile, so get a bunch of shares now and sell it when it hits $0.30 and your stocks settle.""

I blinked, edging away slightly to get away from his drunken breath. This wasn't what I was expecting. ""OK…?"" I said. I'm not sure what a difference of two cents made, but I wasn't about to reason with the drunk guy.

He wasn't done, of course, opting to instead dispense more questionable advice. ""**$HERO**, currently at $0.67. Buy at $0.65, sell it at $0.75. Quick and easy profit. You can pay for noodles next week.""

""These aren't penny stocks, are they?"" I asked, my worry for his mental state subsiding beneath my concern over not being an idiot myself. ""I'm not investing in penny stocks. There are some depths to which even I won't sink.""

Unfazed, he continued. ""**$JOEZ**, also volatile. Buy it at $0.14, sell at $0.15.""

I did the math. Between the trading fees and the difference of mere pennies between the shares' high points and low points, I'd probably have to buy hundreds — actually, no, thousands — of shares just to turn a small profit. And what kind of volume did these stocks even trade at? *If I bought thousands of shares, could I actually sell them when the prices were good?* Before I could ask him anything intelligent, someone from the next table spoke up.

""You aren't really going to take advice from a drunk guy, are you?"" The question came from a girl who looked like she went to the nearby university. ""Even if he were sober, there's no guarantee these volatile small-cap stocks will stay volatile and keep going back up.""

If Myungsoo was upset that a complete stranger was butting into the conversation and doubting him, he didn't show it. Instead he just stared at her for a second, as though trying to comprehend some great mystery of the universe. ""I've got a question for you,"" he finally slurred out.

The girl seemed unimpressed, but nodded. He leaned closer, as if ready to dispense some great truth of the universe or at least an intelligent rebuttal to the points that she had just raised.

""You know what to do with that big fat butt?"" he asked. ""Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.""

Everything went downhill from there.

**TL;DR version:** Was there an actual point to this? I don't know. Do your own DD, or just YOLO and go all-in with some drunk Korean dude's recommendations. Also, I need better friends.",1

BLFS also recently announced increased adoption of current products and interest in the biologistex upcoming solution.

On the fundamentals side, BLFS remains a good story in terms of financials, although last quarter wasn't anything to write home about, the increased sales should give us much better inventory numbers at the least. The balance sheet, in terms of quality was better than the previous quarter. I will link the standardized % PoP.

Liabilities did grow but only by 4% while the equity side shrank a bit too. I believe August numbers will absolutely smash past analyst expectations.

Stock has been in the $60s since mid january, he hasn't been actively involved in the ccompany since Dec 2013 (after he made controversial statements about women's bodies causing leggings to be sheer and not issues with the product like it turned out to be), and it's currently trading at $66.90 as I write this. Only dipped about 2% when he announced he'd filed 4 days ago and it's already recovered. 

Looks like a really solid opportunity to get in at ~10% below market value ",2

However, within the last couple years I have joined Twitter and learned that Twitter can actually be extremely helpful in getting up-to-date news and insight from the people close to the action. It works great for investing and staying informed about the markets. I don't believe the 140 character headline is a substitute for real knowledge, but you can create your twitter so the people you follow have done the leg work and presented you with links to the information you should read. 

Some of the people on this list are the popular financial publications, traders, hedge fund managers, economists, CEOS, billionaires, venture capitalists, analysts, journalists, and general market commentators. Pick and choose who you want to follow, but I wanted to share my list for anybody wanting to get started.

15-06-14,39trjf,Help please! Complete beginner question about inherited stock.,"A family member passed away years ago and I recently realized I inherited some of their stocks. I have no idea what market or company it is in or how much they are worth.

How do I figure out what stocks I have, how much they are worth, and if I would be able to trade or sell them?

Of course I would do research before I do anything with them, but I want to know what I have and how to access it.

15-06-15,39vuf0,Is passive investing the new dotcom mania?,"An interesting idea came across my desk this morning. A lot of strategists have been arguing that the US markets are well into bubble territory. It may be so, but where is the exuberance that usually characterises bubbles? 

In 2000, dotcom mania saw day traders churn stocks into the stratosphere. In 2008, speculators surfed the housing bubble inflated by securitised debt. Where is the mania hiding in plain sight now?

Maybe this time, it's passive investing. Investors have poured money in passive funds, taking on the good with the bad, convinced that they can weather any storm to win the investment game. 

Right or wrong, the pattern has a lot in common with the 'buy the future at any cost' logic of tech investors or the 'housing can never lose' calculations that drove securities until they dropped over the edge.

Is passive investing the new dotcom mania?

15-06-15,39vx3j,Using straddles as insurance.,"Seems like for us buy and hold types, buying a call and put ATM with an expiration a couple months  into the future would be good (even potentially profitable) catastrophic insurance. It would take a $12k long staddle to fully insure a $200000 portfolio against a 10 percent loss, using current SPY premiums. And you'd profit in a greater, more rapid decline.

edit: and it would take just a 5% 30 day upward move to profit $10k on the call.

I know time decay will be a factor, but increased volatility could counter that, right?  And my thinking is that you'd sell well before expiration to rebuy, so expiring worthless isnt a concern. And it might make sense to diversify the straddles with, say, brazil, gold, ibb, etc. Just seems like it would be hard for your insurance to not break even each month (unless sideways markets), especially if your contracts are diverse.

From the article they said it was effectively a stock split, but then it also describes it as a dividend.

Now I understand the effects of a stock split (regarding valuation, number of shares, etc.) but this sounds like it won't necessarily have the same impact as they used the word ""dividend"".

As a UA investor, will I receive the Class C shares, and my other shares will drop significantly in value just like a split, or can the value of each share remain relatively the same, and the Class C shares will be as if someone just gifted me additional shares?  I can't imagine the company value doubling overnight, but the wording is confusing.

07:24 AM EDT, 06/16/2015 (MT Newswires) -- Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding (TNXP), a clinical stage company focused on medicines for fibromyalgia, post-traumatic stress disorder and episodic tension-type headache, said it has begun a Phase 2 study of TNX-201, its product to treat episodic tension-style headaches.
The study is expected to enroll approximately 200 patients at nine clinical centers in the United States. Tonix plans to report top-line results from this study in the fourth quarter of 2015.
The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single 140 mg dose of TNX-201 versus placebo.
""Approximately 75 million people in the U.S. suffer from frequent episodic tension-type headache, a condition that is estimated to be three times as prevalent as migraine,"" said Seth Lederman, chairman and CEO. ""If approved by the FDA, TNX-201 may become the only non-narcotic prescription medicine for episodic tension-type headache and the first new prescription pharmaceutical approved for this indication in more than 40 years.""

Hey /r/investing! I’m a noob about stocks and the stock market but I have a quick question about investing. 

I was standing outside my econ professors door while he was on the phone and I overheard him talking about a stock he bought. He says the symbol is NHLD. It looks like some sort of National Holding Company. He says it has “a low book, rising earnings, and a super low P/E”.

Now I can see that the earnings went up 5.59% today and I can see the P/E rating is 3.22 because Yahoo shows that on the stock page (http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=NHLD&amp;ql=1). However I’m not sure what he meant by “low book”. Does it refer to the price or how much money is on the company’s accounting books?

And finally, if I were to buy that stock, would that be considered insider trading? I know celebrities like Martha Stewart went to jail over doing stuff like that and I wouldn’t want to end up like her (although I wouldn’t mind learning some of her dinner recipes lol).

Thanks ahead to anyone who can help me make sense of this. I appreciate it. :)

15-06-16,3a1hzy,Advice - Sell or Hold (VMC),"I'll admit up front that I'm fairly new to stock trading. Earlier in the year I had pretty good luck with 6 different ETFs. Upon discussions with a broker friend, they suggested I make the plunge and start dealing directly in individual stocks.

One he recommended was VMC (Vulcan Materials Company). His rationale was that aggregate is growing again with a bunch of deals in the pipe as the industry's consolidated down a bit. I bought in at $92.42 (25) days ago. Right now, it's trading -5.5% lower at $87.10. I acknowledge that individual stocks are more volatile than ETFs and perhaps I need a stronger stomach for it, but this initial 1 month drop has me questioning whether this was a wise move. My intent for all of these stocks are to hold until mid next year.

Should I stick with the investment with the assumption it'll rebound in that time frame, or should I cut my losses now (taking a $131 loss) and move it to something else (likely another ETF)...?

15-06-15,39z5dm,Investing – What’s the Point?,"Do you currently invest any of your money for your future? Surprisingly, many people don’t. They think that they just don’t have enough money to invest. But is this really the case? Even if it’s not, how important is it really to get started with investing anyway? After all, you’ll probably only be able to invest $100 per month anyway. It just doesn’t seem hardly worth it. Let me tell you though, it absolutely is.

The Years of Over-Consumption

What’s the typical life pattern for most people? They start school when they’re four or five, they get through grade school, then middle school, then high school, probably college, and THEN they finally start their careers (assuming they don’t immediately go into graduate school). Or they can have a cheap winter days out around London. At this point, they probably have $25,000 worth of debt and they have very little cash in their bank accounts. Are they thinking about investing? Absolutely not! They’re just thinking about how to handle their bills and survive on their own.

Within the first couple of months, that college grad can head in two very different directions. First, they could continue to live an inexpensive lifestyle (like they probably did in college) and pay down their college debt in less than two years, and then invest heavily in their future. Many, however, are deciding to head down the opposite path. After graduation, instead of paying down their debt, they decide to say, “Congratulations self! You deserve a new car for all that hard work you just did.” They then decide to “buy” a $20,000 car with the bank’s money. Instead of investing in their future, they have now put themselves $45,000 in debt.

 

So What’s the Difference?

When I graduated from college, many of my friends took the second option. The cars they purchased weren’t elaborate, but they were brand spanking new, and yep, they cost $20,000. Instead of being jealous when I continued to crawl into my rusted economy car, I just smirked and thought about what a different future we would have. Instead of dishing out thousands of dollars for a new car, I decided to invest my money into various money-making avenues.

Let’s compare the $20k investment that I made vs. my friend. What will these be worth in 40 years? Well, since a car is a depreciating asset and will probably end up in the junk yard long before the 40 years is up. I’d say it’s pretty safe to say that their $20,000 will turn into zero dollars. Now, let’s take a look at my $20,000. Even if I don’t add to this lump sum over the next 40 years, with a consistent 10% profit I’ll have one million dollars. Yeah, you heard me right. One Million Dollars.

So what would you rather have? A brand new car when you’re 22 years old or $1,000,000 when you’re 62? For me, I would much rather delay my gratification and have the million bucks later in life. If you agree, then I would strong advise you to start investing today. Whether you’re 22 or 52, the best day to start investing is today.

If not, perhaps we can start one?  I think it would be great if we could share our strategies and have people from the community help to improve them.  

For example, here's my strategy that someone in another thread asked about:

I look at PE ratio first, and if it's under 25 I usually keep checking things out. Then I try to figure out Sharpe Ratio (but I'm not very good at that) and analyze whatever risk along with that, then I look at historical patters to see if anything looks like it might do something again (especially if it's the energy or airline industry, which I believe has cycles), and then I look at the balance sheets or other data if available, to see if I can figure out intrinsic value better (spoiler alert - I can't), then I look at aspects of management, etc, if I can, to see if they run things well (but usually I don't trust anything anyway so what's the point?). That's about it. What else should I look at? 

It would be nice if I could get help to improve my tactics, and I doubt I'm alone.

I think they'll be announcing their focused strategy on growing their online sales business (currently a small portion of their total revenue), as well as their aggressive expansion plans into the USA. their total number of stores have grown about 25% annually since 2011 - the vast majority of which have been in Canada, so lots of room for growth and market penetration south of the border.

Insider buying was noted before both of the big spikes. The first spike was about major international nuclear players looking into their latest patent to consider implementing it. 

This is when ExTuhC mentioned LTBR [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/36dmnl/what_do_you_guys_think_of_lightbridge_corp_ltbr/). I said it would probably trend back down - it did. Then I said to buy back in because LTBR usually spikes, and there was insider buying. Then it jumped again.

Now the stock has trended back to a reasonable price and yet again, there is a lot of insider buying going on. I have a feeling something will be announced again, very soon. I'm in with 1000 shares at $1.13.

15-06-16,3a1s0q,Market risk app (android) - looking for feedback,"Hi all,

I recently put together a simple app [Markets Weather](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marketsweather.one) to gauge the current expected market risk. It combines simple weather icons and current implied volatilities on different markets. If you have any suggestions or comments, please share it with me :-)

The goal is to let you have an idea of the current risk level on different markets in a matter of seconds. 

Behind the scene, the app starts by computing percentiles (20, 40, 60, 80) on the historical values of the implied volatilities (for each market). In a second time, it choose the icon to display according to the actual implied volatility level and the computed percentiles. To sum up, (relative) low level (&lt;20th perc.) of implied vol will lead to a sun icon, while a (relative) high level (&gt;80th perc.) will lead to a storm icon.

If any markets crosses the 60th percentile, a notification is sent.

The data is coming from CBOE for the historical values and from Yahoo Finance for the current values.

Looking forward to your suggestions!

I'm considering adding either WFT or FI. These are equipment manufacturers, not drillers or refiners. They are direct competitors. 

WFT is the prototypical ""big boy,"" while FI is the up-and-comer. In my summarized opinion, WFT has more signs of life on technical basis, but FI has much stronger fundamentals and pays a pretty good dividend. FI has also has some internal restructuring that I think will be a tailwind for them.

15-06-16,3a01av,UPDATE: Swingtrade Strikes,"INSPIRED BY: lx21

About a month ago, I wrote down a bunch of swingtrades I was going to short (not with real money obviously). This was just a test to see if my new swingtrading strategy would actually work.... and somehow it really is working. I do not have a broker currently that is good with short selling swingtrades so it isn't an option. I used other swingtraders picks and scanned for what they could possibly be looking for. After hours of research I put it to the test. Every position is short.

Started on 5/19 here are my current ones followed by the ones I am done with:

Shorting Swingtrades:



Ticker|Entry Price | Target | Closed | Comment
---|---|----|----|----
ICLD | 3.16 | Target- 52% drop in 6 months | CLOSED 2.77 6/8 |simple swingtrade, basically what I expected. Covered early because of potential bounce.
MNGA | 1.32 | .80 cents in 3 months | CLOSED 1.30 6/8 | While it did drop after I got out, I didn't think this stock had the same pattern set up as the other ones listed. Therefor I got out with a tiny gain.
MNKD | 7.23 | 5.50 in 1 month | CLOSED 5.71 6/11 | Basically got out quickly because I feared a bounce. Price target almost achieved.
THCZ | .224 | .10 in 3 months | Still in this one, will wait until the price target finally hits, it may take another month. | None
ESI | 5.54 |  4 in 3 months | CLOSED 4.12   6/3/15 | Squeezing stock, got out while it dropped a ton!

15-06-16,3a23j9,Is it worth having multiple savings accounts to maximize APY?,"In my early years, I didn't trust banks or know anything of investing (still don't, and still mostly don't, respectively), so I kept everything I earned under the mattress, metaphorically.  I amassed about $130k before deciding to do something with that money.

I've since started investing $5k/mo in stocks/bonds/funds, etc, and put the rest into a Credit Union.  I noticed that my CU gives 4% APY on the first $500 (whooptee-doo) and 0.1% after that.  Looking [over on this chart](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/checking/high-yield-credit-unions.aspx), I can see there are much better APYs elsewhere for bigger balances.

So my question is this:  for a balance of roughly $100k, would it be worth the trouble to open up accounts at multiple CUs, max out the balance cap, and collect a higher APY on the total sum while I continue to invest and dwindle that amount down to something more reasonable (say, $30k liquid)?",0

Why don't more people use stock simulations? They are easy to use and are very accurate and realistic (unless you invest with trillions of dollars).

I set up 12 simulations last year to get a feeling of what kind of returns I would get if I invested with real money.

The simulation that performed the worst is large caps. It did a lot worse than the market.

3 of my simulations beat the market. For one of them, I just invested in the 25 SP500 stocks that had the lowest PE ratio (Yahoo, IBM, Goldman Sachs, AIG, etc.). For the second one, I just invested in the 10 biotech companies with the largest market cap (Gilead, Amgen, Celgene, etc.). For the third one, I invested in good small cap companies that I picked from SEC filings.

I understand that if I was to invest in one of these 3 portfolios with real money for 2015/2016 it won't necessarily beat the market, but I still think that you can learn a thing or two from simulations.",0
15-06-16,3a2a2n,Why and what bonds at this point?,"I'm a little stymied due to very limited bond investing options in my 401K.  I'd like more diversity, and some hedge, but I really only have four options:

* Stable Value (pros, a designated goal of maintaining a fixed NAV, relatively stable dividends that at least keep up with inflation.  1.4-1.7%.  Cons, fixed NAV so no chance of appreciation, but it should absolutely provide a hedge if a massive correction provides a buying opportunity, as well as earning slightly more than my emergency fund does.

*  VBMPX - Vanguard diversified public bond fund, at least medium term, everything is stated to be greater than 1 year.  It's already give up about 5% in the recent months, and I expect it will give up more once rates start to climb.  Dividends are running about 2-2.5% annually.  Fees are dead low, but I wouldn't consider this particularly safe in a rising interest rate environment due to the maturity dates.

* BROAD MARKET BOND I - this is a brand new option this year.  I don't know much about it except that it is also an intermediate term portfolio, and has much higher fee than the Vanguard bond fund.

* Vanguard target date funds - the one closest to my hoped for retirement date would be 2030.  According to the prospectus, the weighted average maturity  is 9.1 years, so again, not particularly safe at all in a rising interest environment IMO.

I currently have almost 10% in VBMPX.  It is the only bond type holding in any of my accounts.  With the exception of my emergency fund which is cash and larger than average, everything else is in a blend of US equities, equity options, equity funds, and foreign equity funds.  Individual equities make up only about 5% of my total holdings.

Two potential options I'm considering is either moving the money from VBMPX  to Stable value to provide hedge.  OR moving it to equity funds, and then going hunting what I'd consider a safer bond fund in my Roth Brokerage accounts.  I'm not sure what that would be but I have to imagine the shorter average duration the better so as to not lose too much value with rising rates.  Ideas?",7

15-06-16,3a2t6r,Surge in Millionaires in China,"It seems the rise of Asian economies is if anything being under played. For example, riding on the back of a continuing ebullient stock market, the numbers of millionaires in China has gone up by some staggering numbers. Hold your breath:  China recorded 2,378,000 millionaires in 2013, compared to the U.S.’ 7,135,000 millionaires, according to Boston Consulting Group’s 2014 Global Wealth Report. China’s millionaire population shot up in 2014, by 82% from 2012. 

In contrast, the total U. S. millionaires only went up by 18 percent from 2012 to 2013, and a mere 5 percent in 2014. Little wonder then that it is in China that we see the fast-growing financial services sector: more than 4,000 new hedge funds have launched in China in the past three months alone. 

Naturally, hedge funds may look a little different in China; they are not often sold to institutions, but to retail investors through banks and brokerages, frequently with lower minimum investments and lock-ups of maybe a year.

China’s outrageous growth comes alongside a near50% increase in the nation's private financial wealth, covering bank deposits, securities and pension funds but not luxury goods and real estate. BCG assigned the riswe to China’s surge in the “shadow banking” sector, in which credit is swapped through alternative financiers.

China and the Asia-Pacific (ex. Japan) are causing an increase in the total global private financial wealth, despite the U.S. continuing to post high numbers. The region now contains $37 trillion (24%) of the world’s $152 trillion in private wealth.

At current rate of growth, the Asia-Pacific region is predicted to excede Western Europe in 2014 as the world’s second-wealthiest region, trailing behind North America.

15-06-16,3a345j,"3 Months On This Subreddit, What Can Be Learned","I have now hit my 3 month mark on this subreddit (posting) and probably make up about a little less then half of the total posts. Since joining I do not think anything has actually changed in terms of quality of posts. Based on what I have seen, most people are in and out within a few weeks. 


A few things I have picked up:

* There is a lot of spam- People will just post tickers asking for opinions on them while at the same time provide 0 context as to why they are asking. In a way it is funny, they will say ""what is your opinion on FREE"" then they say nothing after that.

* Little to no moderation- Not a bad thing tbh, just kind of strange how barely any posts ever get removed even if someone is spamming/trolling. Hell, I am confident a post can stay on the front page for at least 12 hours when it contains porn, malware, or just a screamer.

* People rarely stay- Obviously this is something I kinda figured would happen. Most people brag about making a killing on 1 stock and are losing on the rest. Long story short they lose all their money in their accounts and have no interest in gambling/pennystock trading after that. Maybe 5% of the people still posting posted at least a few times 3 months ago.

* Gamblers thought process- Too many people are simply gamblers on here. Unfortunately people are too busy asking about stupid sub pennystocks instead of educating themselves on how options work. What I mean is, why trade a sub pennystock when you can trade options? Seriously, the risk is realistically a lot lower and your potential gains are about the same. Only problem is, options take more research and a better understanding of how stocks move. Hell, why not just play online blackjack if you are looking to make a killing?

* Lastly the quality of posts- Not shocking at all, but the quality of posts is actually insanely low. Most people on here simply do not understand what they are talking about. This will result in clueless traders telling newbie traders what to do (""investing in OTC stocks is great choice"").

My opinions, what are your thoughts?

15-06-17,3a518p,"I'm new to investing and have a few basic questions (Roth or not to Roth, index vs mutual, financial advisor or go solo, etc)","I'm in my late 20's and want to get my investing affairs in order. I've been doing some research and it has lead me to the following questions:

1) In my early 20s I inherited some money which i invested through a financial advisor my uncle knew. The money went into the following positions at the advisor's recommendation: AZNAX (60%), SMCWX (25%), SKNRX (15%). I also opened a Roth IRA through him which I have been contributing to each year and is invested across the following positions: JLCAX (50%), AWSHX (30%), AZNAX (20%). Both of these accounts are managed through LPL Financial, with that advisor as my point of contact. I pretty much never speak to this financial advisor as I live in a different state now and I'm not really sure what is has to offer me, or if he has by best interests at heart, and he is certainly not actively managing these accounts. I am also concerned about the fees incurred with these accounts. So, I'm considering moving these accounts into Vanguard for consolidation purposes, no-longer relying on this financial advisor to execute my investments, and possibly moving my non-Roth IRA investments into a Vanguard index fund. Does this sound like a logical thing to do? I like index funds because they seem to out-perform mutual funds over time for passive investors such as myself, and have lower fees. Are there any fees I should be concerned about in moving my accounts to Vanguard? Or I am possibly thinking about any/all of this the wrong way?

2) I have a traditional 401k through my company in a Vanguard account, which I'm currently putting 15% of my paycheck into. My company matches up to 4% with company stock. Would it make sense for me to switch my 401k to a be invested as a Roth 401k? My understanding is that if you believe tax rates will be higher when you take your money out than when you put it in, you should go with Roth. But is there more to it I should consider? With national debt going up, it would seem to be a logical bet that tax rates will be higher when I retire than now. 

3) As mentioned above I'm putting 15% of my paycheck into my company's 401k, but they only match up to 4%. Should I consider investing less in the 401k and more into other investments such as index funds I manage outside of my 401k?

Thank you all. I really appreciate your time and responses. ",2
15-06-17,3a52cb,Holding an ES contract vs holding $VOO on margin,"I'm new to futures and I was wondering how these two hypothetical portfolios compare:

A:

* 1 ES Dec18'15 @GLOBEX for $104,325; Roll every 6 months or so
* $60,000 cash

B:

* 104,325 of $VOO
* -$44,325 cash (margin loan)

I'm asking because my current portfolio looks like B (but with more funds, less leverage, and a lot smaller :P ) and I'm thinking of switching to A. My goal here is total return over a long time horizon (20 years?).

The only downside I see is that I'll lose exposure to dividends but that's acceptable since I don't want income. 

[All numbers below assume Interactive Brokers commissions and margin] 

Advantages I see for A:

- Don't have to pay $52.16/year management fee for $VOO. Instead pay $4.02/year to roll ES every 6 months.

- Don't have to pay 1.63% margin interest

- No tracking error

- Half of the 60k cash can be kept in a high yield savings/MM/CD account, ready to be wired into the brokerage account [when the S&amp;P drops 20%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_curb#Circuit_breakers). 

- margin requirement is $6k instead of $26,081.25 (assuming Reg-T account)

15-06-16,3a3j1z,Just forget about your investments already!,"When I have a bit of time on my hands, I like to trade over short periods of time. Usually I stick to gold and currencies, which I feel more comfortable with, but once in a while I’ll trade indexes too. I just try to wait until people freak out about an index being really low, like hitting a 6-month or 12-month low, and buy. You can’t really go wrong with indexes, they always end up going up, the only thing is how long will it take, and if you get scared, or need the money right now, you may exit a losing position. I can afford to wait, so it is not a risky trade if the index goes South for a while.

Anyway, I read that the S&amp;P500 was super low, and people were starting to get worried, so following the “when others cry, you should buy” precept, I went ahead and bought some.

Then later in the day, I had a small profit, and started wondering, like anyone else, if it would still go down some more. So I closed my position, took my profit and called it a day.

Look, it’s here:

spx500

 

I bought on the little blue dot, saw it go up, then as I only had the knowledge of the past prices to the left, thought it may hit another bottom, and sold on the little orange dot, just as the index was starting to go up big time. I had 5 units, so those 20 points made me about $100, which is still better than a loss. Had I kept the trade open, gone on with my day and sold it at the end of the week, I would have had $500 instead. I got emotional, and missed out on the price raise.

If you look at it from the past year, the buy was solid, it was a 6 month low and everything looked good.

spx500 year

Until I became my own worst enemy.

And I am not the only one. There is a study from Fidelity that shows the accounts that best performed where the ones people didn’t touch, because they forgot they even had a trading account! You know that the majority of fund managers underperform compared to indexes. A handful will perform better and everyone will want in, until they stop performing so well, because they took too many risks.

But one of the biggest mistake investors make is selling too soon, and holding to losing positions for too long.

My day trades are just another way to diversify my income streams and I don’t take trading very seriously, but if you are saving for retirement and want a nest egg you can actually count on, do the exact opposite: buy indexes, every month like clockwork, and forget about them until you retire.

15-06-17,3a597a,An Unconventional Approach to Buy and Hold,"In my previous post I discussed the reasons why the conventional buy and hold method doesn’t work. Why? Because the likes of Warren Buffett and other buy and hold supporters are keeping you in the dark on some critical things. Below are the additional “factors” you need to add in order to make buy and hold work for you. Without these factors, buy and hold will not work – you’ll be like the poort sap who dumped their stocks at the bottom of the 2008/2009 stock market crash.

You Need a Side Business
Warren Buffett’s company Berkshire Hathaway (really just a legal entity that owns other companies) is a very unique business. And no, it’s not because “Warren Buffett buys cheap stocks, value stocks, Buffett’s a great guy blah blah blah”. It’s because of Warren Buffett’s investment model. Buffett’s true buy and hold strategy works something like this.

Start off with $200,000 in 1950 (yes, Buffett’s dad was a Congressman in the 1940′s/50′s). Buy a company (let’s call it Company A). Use the cashflow from that Company A to buy shares in another attractive company (let’s call this Company B). Eventually have enough cash from Company A to buy all of Company B. Use the newly combined cashflow to buy shares in Company C. Eventually have enough cash from Company A and Company B to buy all of Company C. Repeat this process with Companies D, E, F, G, and so on.

Thus, Berkshire Hathaway is a Buy and Hold Machine. That’s why Buffett’s biography is called The Snowball. Your investments will snowball as you own more and more companies. The mechanisms of this investment strategy are real slick. The cash generated from businesses goes into investing in other businesses, which increases the cash flow, which allows for more businesses to be bought, which generates even larger cash flows. And the cycle repeats itself.

Obviously, you and I don’t have $200,000 to start off with ($200,000 in Buffett’s time is equivalent to $2 million today). Thus, we need to start our own business. Since most of y’all are working full time in other jobs, this will have to be a side business. Many financial bloggers are doing this – Pauline (based on her monthly income reports) makes somewhere in the neighborhood of $3000, and she’s doing this while touring Europe!

Once you have that side business up and running, feed it into your Buy and Hold machine. The other beauty of having a side business is that if you lose your job, you won’t be forced to sell your stocks at possibly the worst price ever. You can use the money from your side business to make ends meet at home for a while.

Your Side Business Needs to be a Cash Cow
The fact that you have a side business is great – you can feed the profits from that business into your buy and hold investment strategy. However, all of this is useless if your business is not a cash cow.

If your business works something like this, then it is not a cash cow company.

It’s 2013. I signed one contract for $50,000, and it’s going to take me a year and a half to complete this contract.
It’s 2015. I just signed another contract for $45,000, and it’s going to take me a year to complete this contract.
If the time lapse inbetween “cashflow” (Contract #1 vs. Contract #2) is a long time (in this case, over a year), then this is not a cash flow company. What’s wrong with that? Because if you look at Warren Buffett’s model, he buys a ton of stocks whenever the economy’s in trouble and other companies are cheap. However, he is only capable of doing this because his businesses are cash cows – they throw off a steady stream of income, meaning that when he needs to buy a company, he will certainly have the cash ready (his businesses always throw off cash). Here’s an example.

Your side business works off of 2 year contracts. Contract #1 started in early 2008. Contract #2 started in early 2010. That means you missed a window of opportunity in March 2009 when stocks were dirt cheap.

But if you had a steady cash flow, you would have been ready (time-wise) to buy when stocks were cheap in early 2009.",1

When you tell somebody they shouldn't be doing something because it's beyond their skill level, what you're implying is that they don't have the capacity to eventually learn and master it. That's not the worst part. The ugliness comes from you believing to have these special powers yourself. You were able to go from zero to finance savant. Now you can judge. There's almost no true benevolence here, just ego.

What's worse is the guys who admittedly can't beat the market, then knock down those who try. Since when does complete failure and surrender make someone an expert?  Each one of you was motivated at one time to steal from the market a bit more than a comfortable sum 40 years down the line. Nothing wrong with admitting it's not worth losing your soul and sanity over. But others might be more driven.

Fiverr gigs

photo2Aside from my main side hustle (freelance SEO services) I have been trialling some other online platforms including Fiverr. My latest gig? I will say your message and do a backflip. This alternative video greeting gig isn’t going to make me a millionaire but I can complete a single gig in just 10mins which theoretically provides an hourly rate of $24-$48 per hour (depending on the gig extras as some gigs pay double). I can certainly see how listing more gigs like this could provide a steady side income which provides plenty of opportunity to scale this revenue stream in the future.

The secret? – Utilise gig extras and only list gigs on Fiverr that you can complete in 15mins or less to ensure your hourly rate remains high!

Writing college overviews

Bio-Shot-HeadshotBeing a writer by heart, my side hustles have typically been writing gigs of one kind or another.  There have been both some boring and interesting ones along the way.  In one case, I had to write overviews of more than 200 colleges and universities for an online directory based in California.  I earned (a whopping) $.02 per word, or about $8 per 400-word article.  Lots of coffee inspired me through those articles.  Another time, I worked for a law office summarizing depositions.  The attorney was deposing the mechanic, pilot, and accident reconstruction specialist involved in the crash of a small propeller plane, which was pretty interesting.

Making jingles and websites for companies

listen money mattersIt’s all about digging deep within yourself and asking, “what am I good at?” For me, it’s doing creative work like designing websites and writing songs.

I spent a lot of time just designing websites and writing songs for myself and putting my work out there for all to see. There’s a great book called Show Your Work which talks about this very thing. After a few weeks, I started getting contacted to design websites and making jingles for companies. I was able to sell all my creative services for more than $1,000 a job.

When work started to die down, I drove around in my car and found local businesses that I was familiar with and asked them if they needed any of my services. I was bringing in more than $3,000 a month just doing what I was good at, and what I was doing for fun already.

Nowadays, I turn down work because I just don’t have the time. I also charge a lot more for my services because I see the value in what I can do for people. The real challenge is pricing. I read another book called Book Yourself Solid, which opened my eyes to my true worth and got me the clients that I truly wanted to work with, without sacrificing my income.

Sign up bonuses

Kim-Parr-2The easiest side hustle that I’ve done recently is opening bank accounts that offer a bonus. I don’t sign up for ones that require too many hoops to get the payout, like direct payroll deposit or a ton of money as a minimum daily balance. I have signed up for accounts with Capital One, US Bank, and TD Ameritrade. All of these only required a minimum deposit and something simple like making a set number of debit card transactions or paying a few bills online. You do have to keep the account open for a certain amount of time, usually 6 months. The husband and I have snagged about $600 over the past year. It isn’t a huge amount of money, but for the time invested, it’s a pretty good return. We only use money that would be sitting in a savings account anyway, so it’s nice to get a little bit back to make up for the low interest rates.

15-06-18,3a8cdi,21 Year old with 10k cash starting investing - Roth/401k/ETF help,"Hey everyone, 

I've been sitting on cash in the bank for too many years and after lurking on this sub for a while now, its time to finally get my feet wet.

Lets start with a little bit of background. I'm currently 21 years old and am starting my senior year at college in August. I will be graduating next may and starting salary in my field is ~70k and I will treat that as guaranteed for various reasons. Some brief financial background.

* Currently have an internship at $3400 per month pre-tax, the company I'm working for matches up to 5% for interns and I am doing all 5%. It is going into a Vanguard index fund.
* In the bank, I have ~12k cash in savings and enough in checking to last me through senior year
* I will come out of school with no debt thanks to generous and financially stable parents
* I will make around another 4k through the end of this summer
* As stated, mid next year I will be starting a job making around $70k
* The only large purchase in my near future (5 year) would be a new (or newer used) car, lets say for $30k, with around a $15k trade in 
* I do NOT want to actively manage the account. I don't have time at school to worry about moving around my money and I trust others to do this for me.

To the questions I have for you guys...from what I've been reading the general recommendation for me when I can take so much risk is to invest a lot in ETFs. However, I always want to start taking advantage of a Roth IRA. Again from this subs advice, I should set this up for Vanguard. Onto the questions...

* What type of distribution should I look at for the Roth? All in one Vanguard fund? 
* If I invest the 5500 into a Roth this year, what do I do with the other 7k cash I'll have lying around? 
* Since I have the cash now, would it be better to defer more income from my internship into a IRA/401k? If I do this I would be limited in what I could invest in however.
* What ETFs do you recommend when as I said, I don't want to actively manage the account?
* I don't want to sound naive, but would it be better to invest all this after the uneasiness of a market correction or recession calms? Should I even be worrying about this?

I appreciate any additional advice you can offer up to me at this point. I'm young and ambitious, and I'm all ears for suggestions.",2

**Text from the link (a few charts in there too):**
*When Obama was elected in 2008, everyone on Wall Street said “oh well, the coal stocks are fucked,” sort of tongue in cheek. During the 2012 elections, at a time when Romney was up in the polls, coal stocks ran like canaries in the clean fresh open sky. After Obama won, I vowed to never buy a coal stock again.*

*The entirety of the industry is bankrupted, 100% thanks to the EPA. Now I struggle with this because I fucking hate coal, with every fiber of my being. I want to pelt coal executives in the heads with sharp coal digging shovels and blow up their harems with truckloads of their fucking byproducts. On the other hand, the good lads working in West Virginia, acquiring the black lung free of charge, will now need to find work elsewhere. Quite frankly, all of those people are too stupid to do anything else, other than pick rocks out from the mountains of Appalachia. And, by the way, “The Fly” never digresses, not even for a solitude second.*

*Perusing the masterpiece that is Exodus tonight, I am stunned by how fast and furious the dissolution of the coal industry has been. Once great names, like WLT, BTU, ACI and ANR, are now on the road to Valhalla. You should bear witness to this because it’s the beginning of the end of an ancient industry. A clownish industry that once tried to refurbish their dastardly product as ‘clean coal’, but now reduced to the ash from President Obama’s newport cigarette (extra menthol).*

*Now it’s just stupid coal.*",0
15-06-17,3a4bw4,"BLFS, The news we needed, not the news we wanted. Microcap update by Simon","On Monday we saw BLFS explode and then fade out. This was fueled by news of a prostate trail (also previously withheld). 

My recommendation was to day-trade the Ebola news. But if you day-traded this, you would've made money too.

The fact is, the prostate trial is not what I called. The prostate trial simply adds to the pool of 184 trials which use BLFS products such as Cryostor.


The reason BLFS faded out was due to the addition of little fundamental info to the company's operations since the March earnings call.

Where the fundamentals are different, are in the past news and the under-radar ebola news.

The ebola news presents huge opportunity for other temperate climates which run high risks of disease and would require some sort of cold-chain assistance and cryopreservation to do medical in.

I believe the material information of the Ebola news may add as much as 10% to the revenue looking out in the future. The Ebola trials could also use Biologistex, the company's new product.

There are a lot of companies partnered on Ebola research. This can further the product's growth through recommendation from researchers, word of mouth, etc. This company is seriously under-valued. If will either become a giant and corner the market in this field or it will be bought out into 2016.



I believe the company will release an official PR, with the specific pharma's name who is using the product within this month. I will be purchasing shares under 2.25-2.30  given no negative news arises, and still hold my original set of shares.",2

15-06-18,3a8or9,"If you bought into the S&amp;P500 at the peak in 2000 and held until today, your real return would have been ~0%","**EDIT**: Yes, I forgot to factor dividends. Factoring dividends your annualized real return would have been roughly 2%. I will also add that another point this highlights is the importance of DCA, which a lot of people have pointed out in the comments. And finally, people seem to think I'm advocating not being in the S&amp;P, or trying to time the market, or something else. Not at all. I just think this time period highlights that (a) uncertainty/risk is very real in financial markets and (b) there are basic steps you can take to defend against that uncertainty.

In September 2000, the S&amp;P 500 peaked around the 1500 level. Now, 15 years later it's been hovering around 2000-2100 for about 6 months. That's a total return of about 39%. Counting reinvested dividends your total return would have been ~88%. But inflation would have eaten about 37% of that. If you annualize that difference and factor in fees and taxes, your real return would have been pretty close ~~to 0%.~~ to 2% annualized.

I don't necessarily have a specific point with this post. I was just fiddling around with an S&amp;P 500 chart and this was something that struck me (and I do know that picking the peak of the 2000 bubble is cherry-picking). But I still think it highlights a few important things. First, the importance of *real* diversification. The S&amp;P 500 does not represent true diversification. There are so many other countries and so many other asset classes. The more *truly* diversified you are, the less likely you are to be exposed to such poor returns. 

Second, I think it highlights the importance of being realistic about future returns. What kind of real returns are you counting on? What are those expectations based on? Should you actually be saving more? Some people have realistic expectations, but I definitely see a lot of people on this sub extrapolating based on the past 5-6 years, which is bound to lead to disappointment.

Lastly, I think it's important to be really being honest with yourself about time horizons. If you have money in equities, what is it for? Is it actually money that's got a multiple-decades-long time horizon? Or is it money that you have parked in the market because you think the returns will help you buy a house in 5 years?",350
15-06-17,3a5okk,"S&amp;P E-Mini Rollover and Data Collection","Hello,

I am collecting data for the S&amp;P E-Mini to use for back testing trading strategies. As you may know, the S&amp;P E-Mini contracts roll over every three months, which can be seen here;

http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/e-mini-sandp500_product_calendar_futures.html?_sm_au_=iMV6sWt6k47VQnsr

The last trading day for a given contract is the Thursday before the third Friday of the month that a new contract begins. So, for example, with the September contract starting on 6/20/15, the third Friday was 6/19/15, and the Thursday before is 6/11/15. So on 6/11/15 the data collection should be for the September contract and no longer the June contract.

This is where my confusion begins. How do you ""normalize"" the data, so that June contract data is equivalent to the September contract data? Do you take the delta between the two contract values on 6/11/15 (the Thursday before) and either add or subtract that to all of the values that have already been collected? 

So if your June contract was at 2000 and September was at 2001, you add $1 to every data point that was collected before September.

15-06-17,3a5pp7,"[Advice] buying mature stocks for dividend returns, and not expecting future growth.","Hi Guys,

I've been lurking this sub for months now, and I've been reading the intelligent investor (one 3rd of it almost).

I'm from the middle east, and I was considering investing in the US market. but a friend of mine pointed out that he is investing in the local market instead.

So I decided to take a look just to know what is going on, and for my surprise the market is very stable, and the dividend return of many of the mature/key companies is unbelievable (5-8%) .

So my question is, what do you think of an investment, where the company's future is safe (monopoly + essential service + proven track record).

And a good annual return on dividends.

but without expecting a real growth. 

this is the other extreme compared to the US market (high growth, low dividends ""2-3%"" ).


To make things clear, I'm considering this to be my safe investment, it can be up to 70% of my portfolio. and I'm planning on keeping the stocks and buying them for the foreseeable future (5-10 years at least).

I'm looking for help building my 403b portfolio with TIAA-CREF. The funds are expensive and limited. I contribute 5% and get a 10% match. Below is my current fund allocation and below that are the other available funds.

Current allocation
&gt;35% CREF Global Equities 0.70%

&gt;35% CREF Stock 0.69%

&gt;10% CREF Growth 0.64%

&gt;20% TIAA Small-Cap Blend Index Fund 0.91%

&gt;CREF Equity Index 0.61%

&gt;TIAA Access Equity Index Fund T4 0.82%

&gt;TIAA Access Growth &amp; Income Fund T4 1.20%

&gt;TIAA Access International Equity Fund T4 1.26%

&gt;TIAA Access Large-Cap Value Fund T4 1.20%

&gt;TIAA Access Mid-Cap Growth Fund T4 1.22%

&gt;TIAA Access Mid-Cap Value Fund T4 1.20%

&gt;TIAA Access Real Estate Securities Fund T4 1.27%

&gt;TIAA Access Small-Cap Equity Fund T4 1.30%

&gt;CREF Bond Market 0.69%

&gt;CREF Inflation Linked Bond 0.64%

&gt;TIAA Access Bond Plus Fund 1.08%

&gt;TIAA Traditional (Guaranteed Annuity)

&gt;TIAA Real Estate 0.87%

&gt;Lifecycle Fund 2045 or 2050 1.21%

My rationale for going with my current allocation is that it has low expense ratios and pretty good diversification. CREF Growth tracks the Russell 1000, Small-Cap Blend Index tracks the Russell 2000, CREF Global Equities tracks the MSCI, and CREF Stock tracks both the Russell 3000 and the MSCI. I have about 74% in US stocks and 26% in international. I have 57% in Mega/Large companies, 29% in Mid, and 14% in Small. My combined ER is about 0.74%, which seems about as good as I can do if I want diversification.

There are a couple other funds that I don't want (Social Choice Equity fund and a money market) so I didn't list. I want an aggressive portfolio and have a high risk tolerance. This is a retirement 403b account but I also have a Roth IRA that uses a TD fund through Vanguard. I currently have no money in the 403b (I start contributing at the end of July). I have $19k in the IRA. I won't be touching either account for 30 years. Please let me know if you need to know anything else about me.",2

15-06-18,3a8zsp,What I’ve Learned By Starting an Online Business,"If you are anything like me, then you’ve had plenty of dreams of becoming the next big internet entrepreneur. Unfortunately, the chances of becoming the next internet affiliate marketing superstar is actually fairly slim, now i’m not saying it’s can’t be done, I just feel that it’s a lot more difficult than it used to be, as more and more people are trying their hand at making money online.

So late last year I decided to take a slightly different approach, so I created a web store that sold physical products. I realised that I wasn’t quite ready to abandon my goal of making side income online, but I also didn’t really want to turn into one of those shady affiliate marketers that would push anything – so an online shop seemed like the perfect solution.

So today I am going to talk about my experience creating an online store and how it is going so far. Note: I won’t be giving specifics on the product I am selling.

 

Getting Started – It Costs Money
Probably the biggest thing that I realised when I started out with this web store, was that getting started was hard. Having an idea is one thing, but actually putting things into action is quite another.

Not only is it very time consuming, but it can be very expensive as well, and as someone who is big on saving money, I really wanted to be sure that I wasn’t going to be flushing my money down the toilet. After all, you have to buy stock, organise supply chain management, promote your website and most importantly of all – you need a product that people want to buy.

Overall my wife and I have spent close to $20K on our business so far, and to date we have only returned about 20%-25% of that. But considering that we only started in January, and that our sales have started to become nice and steady (see screen capture below), I am confident that in the long run we will end up turning the business into something that is very profitable.

 What I've Learned By Starting an Online Business

Now many of you are probably thinking that I’m crazy spending that kind of money on a new internet business, but I did do a lot of initial testing to ensure that there was a market for this product.

In order to test the market, I created a website that sold similar products (the products were through Amazon) and I ranked the site to the 1st spot in Google for one of the keywords I was targeting. What I discovered was that people not only liked the product, but that I was getting between 3 and 4 sales per day.

Now unfortunately the way I tested the website was not sustainable, and eventually the site got hit by a Google penalty. I suspect this was because I purchased black hat links to rank the site – I was a little annoyed, but it served its purpose and it did tell me that I could easily make money in the niche I had selected. This gave me enough confidence to spend a fairly large sum of money setting up my own product line ready for sale.

 

Patience
The next big thing I learned was patience. During the first month I was pretty upset that we weren’t getting any sales, and even the second month where we had just a couple of sales I was still pretty concerned. You see doing things the right way takes time, and I am in this for the long haul, which means that I am not interested in ranking my website the same way that I did the test one with shady links.

Anyway, after a while things have started to settle down and now we are starting to make around 7/8 sales per month, which works out to be about $700 per month. Obviously this is a lot less than the 3 to 4 sales per day I could be getting if I was at the top of the search results, but it’s enough to keep me satisfied that eventually we will have a good steady side income stream on our hands.

 

Marketing &amp; Diversify Traffic Sources
Marketing is probably the hardest part of any business, whether it be a traditional bricks and mortar business, or an online one. This is something that took me a while to learn when I first started building websites online, but in short – no one is going to buy your product if they can’t find it. It sounds so simple now, but back then I just didn’t have a clue about internet marketing.

I also used to think that targeting search engines was the answer to getting people to your website, but in reality I think this is a mistake. It’s so easy to get caught up in the massive amount of traffic search engines like Google can provide, that people often forget about some other really great traffic generating websites that exist.

One of the big ones for me is social sharing websites like Pinterest or shopping websites like Wanelo. They are both great at sending quality traffic to my site, and the best part is that it converts far better than Google.

My analytics stats for the last 6 months showing Google &amp; Wanelo

 Google &amp; Wanelo

I honestly feel that these types of sites are too often overlooked, and that they can provide a great way for online businesses to generate sales.

I would love to hear about any of your own experiences with starting a business online. What did you learn and what can you share with others before they start out.",1

I work a desk job in finance and have time throughout the day to research stocks, read filings and perform due diligence, so I think it's the right move to take my hand at managing a portfolio.

15-06-17,3a7bkb,Fibonacci Retracement Question,"Hello all,

I have a question regarding Fibonacci retracement on the following website page.  (http://www.babypips.com/school/elementary/fibonacci/when-fibonacci-fails.html)
The website page is discussing the flaws of Fibonacci Retracements.

In the example that they use, one's entry order is around $1.4850, and then one short sells at the 50% Fib level of around $1.509. The price then begins to skyrocket after you short sell. 

The author says that this is catastrophic to one's account and will result in a lot of loss.  Am I missing something? First, one would have made money at the 50% Fib level regardless.  Second, if you bought in at $1.4850 and decided to hold past the 50% Fib level, one would end up being able to even make more money.  

The author says, ""Now, if you really did put an order at that level, not only would your dreams go up in smoke, but your account would take a serious hit if you didn’t manage your risk properly!""

This doesn't make sense to me.  Regardless of where you sold at, you make money. I am new to trading in general and was wondering how you would lose money in this scenario. (Obviously if it fell, you would lose money.  But in this scenario, it only rises).  I think that I am misunderstanding something.  An explanation would be appreciated.  Thanks!

15-06-18,3a9ht9,Using interest from investments to pay student loans,"Long story short, thanks to a workers comp settlement I have $70k to invest. Low and behold, I also came out of grad school with $110k in student loan debt. At age 25 I still have ~$105k left. As it currently stands I have the funds sitting in a MMA for the time being, until I can formulate a route for investing the capital. I like to be pretty hands on with my money, as I prefer to become educated on the topic instead of having an advisor telling me what funds they think I should go with, while lining their pockets with commissions. I also have had a bevy of graduate level instruction in economics, albeit on the macro level. I recognize that it is no substitute for being educated in finance, but I'm aware of how the market operates and the general options before me.

My self managed Roth IRA is currently netting annual returns of 10%-11% after fees, so I have various funds and bonds which I'm quite comfortable with (always looking to diversify more though). My current student loan situation is one in which I'm in the Pay as You Earn repayment plan, with current monthly payments being ~$175 and projected to reach $600 if I stick with the plan the whole 20 years. Luckily I work in one of the various professions which is considered ""public service"", and am eligible for loan forgiveness after making 10 years of qualified payments, of which I've paid 1 year so far. After its paid off I intend to use the funds as a down payment for a house and towards my retirement. 

My main question is what would be the best route to invest the money so that I can use the interest to make the payments? My current investments are low dividend bearing, but I could always sell off some of the earned interest (which would amount to ~$7k annually) in order to pay the next year's loans. I just don't know if that would be the most cost effective route in terms of fees (all NTF investments BTW) and taxes. Any guidance would be much appreciated.",1

From what i remember they have entered some form of partnership with Monster but im thinking its going to take something else to really accelerate their growth, does anyone have any ideas as to what that could be? Could Coke compete with Pepsi and sell snacks alongside beverages?

I do think Coke offers a solid Div yield at the moment (3.27%) and a payout ratio around 65%. But i just think its going to take a bit more than that before i decide to become a share holder even taking into account the overall business model.

15-06-18,3acaiq,First Solar. Analysis of business practices and recent record breaking. Feedback?,"I'm still pretty new to investing. I recently decided to check out the renewable energy sector, and came across [First Solar](https://www.google.com/finance?q=first+solar&amp;ei=TkSDVbmTK-W7iwLX8oCQBA). 

According to [this](http://www.bidnessetc.com/45378-here-is-why-first-solar-inc-fslr-stock-is-surging-today/), they seemed like a company worth doing further research into. 

In particular, 

&gt; Shares of First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) are soaring during the opening hours on Monday after the company revealed record-breaking efficiency levels.

&gt; In a press release on Monday, First Solar announced cadmium-telluride (CdTe) photovoltaic module conversion levels of 18.6%, for “an advanced full size module.”

So, I decided to do some [research](http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=1025479&amp;ticker=FSLR) on their CEO. 

Some interesting facts:

* Joins First Solar as CCO (Chief Commercial Officer) in March, 2012.
* Two months later, becomes CEO.
* Served as COO (Chief Operating Officer) for *Enron* Global Assets. 
* Began career as a lawyer.

I'm honestly not sure how common it is for someone to join a company and quickly become a CEO in less than half a year's time of working there. I would also think that a CEO with a background in law is very saavy, financially. 

However, are there benefits which can be garnered from a law degree with respect to making key business decisions within a fluctuating market? I'm talking more from the perspective of the company's success with respect to their ability to remain competitive than things like operating cash flow and net profit.

I'll touch on the bit about his previous experience with Enron Global further downward.

After all of this, I found this bit on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Solar#Allegations_of_Undermining_Solar_Power):

&gt; A new study by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR) finds that the Waltons are funding nearly two dozen anti-solar groups — such as the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) and Americans for Prosperity, which are waging state and national fights to roll back clean energy policies — while a Walton-owned energy company is pushing for regulations that hinder the growth of rooftop solar power. Rooftop solar has been cited as a tremendous opportunity to accelerate the transition to renewable power, save money for homeowners, and create tens of thousands of new jobs, but, as the report details, the Waltons’ interventions and spending are a very real threat to this future.[37]

First Solar is owned by the Waltons as well:

 &gt;“In June 2013, Walton-owned First Solar sent shock waves through the solar industry when its CEO, James Hughes, published an op-ed in the Arizona Republic endorsing a proposal by the state’s biggest utility to impose a new fee on households with rooftop solar. Averaging about $50 to $100 a month, the proposed fee would be large enough to completely destroy the economics of household energy production, halting the spread of residential rooftop solar in Arizona. As the rest of the solar industry closed ranks and joined with environmental and consumer groups in opposing the plan, First Solar backed the utility, insisting that it was right to maximize its financial position. Bryan Miller, a vice president at Sunrun and president of the Alliance for Solar Choice, put First Solar’s actions in perspective: “No solar company has publicly advocated against solar until First Solar.”[39]

Given all of this information, it obviously seems like Hughes' background with Enron had a lot to do with his current position as CEO. What exactly that the background contributes to this, though, I'm not sure of, but I have a theory:

* Large Mega Giant (LMG) supports anti-global warming theories and energy produced via fossil fuels.
* LMG comes across a company which supports opposing values and therefore could really become a potential threat soon. 
* LMG therefore decides to buy out the company, appoint a new CEO, and maintain some kind of stronghold in their opposing market.

    - The CEO needs to worry less about growing the company and more about maintaining it financially, keeping it alive, and remaining competitive only to threaten competing companies and contribute to the prevention of their growth.

APDN is a company that uses plant DNA to mark practially anything for identification and verification in order to prevent counterfieting.  DNA is extracted, sequenced and encrypted.  They are able to make it as minute to mark the exact batch/lot of whatever product that needs to be marked.  They have contracts with cash in transit providedrs like Brinks/Loomis, the Federal Govermenment is marking a certain class of microchips and is undergoing tests to expand to 6 different federal supply groups.  They also have contracts with the Missile Defense agency.  Pima cotton has been using them for a while and their first finished products are to hit the stores in the Fall.  Louis Dreyfus has also signed on as of this week.  That is a private company that has had over $64 billion in sales for FY2014, and yes, that is a part of the company/family that birthed Julia from Seinfeld and VEEP on HBO.  

Other applications on the consumer side are a kit that people can buy to mark items that can be identified by police using a UV light and samples can be forensically identified after testing.  This was recently detailed for place up North East in Camden County NJ.

One of my favorite applications is their Smoke Cloak.  If someone breaks into ta store, a machine trips their fog product which spews out and gets on items and criminals.  Since the DNA of the store is sequenced to only that store it is easy to tie the items to the crime/criminal once found.

As far as I know, this is the first offshore driller to do so. I'm still expecting a major player to merge here in the next year. 

I see major gains in the Oil sector, specifically offshore drilling contractors.

Now hear me out;

1. Yes we have seen a rapid decline in rig utilization. But at the same time,

2. We are seeing old rigs being retired in unprecedented numbers.

3. Production around the globe (aside from Saudi) has been curtailed due to the reduction in profits.

4. Nobody is spending money on maintenance or refits. (Offshore units especially)

Now, sooner or later the glut and demand will inverse and we will start to see the price rise. Oil projects don't just turn on with the flick of a switch, it can take up to 6mths to mobilize a rig even longer if they require a recertification shipyard (every 5yrs). Based on fleet status reports, a majority of stacked rigs are going to be unclassified in the next 2yrs. 

Production will be lacking and the winner is going to be whoever can spec out their rigs first and maintain the utilization rates.

Personally, I see Transocean and Ensco as the leaders with Seadrill and Noble coming in behind. Maersk is the wildcard.

Transocean has a number of new builds still in the making, but ever since the Macando Blowout, they didn't cut steel unless they had a contract, where as Seadrill has been building and hoping they have contracts by the time they launch.

This is similar to the downturns of the 80's, 90's, and back in 2007. People who work in industry seem to call it the ""Tripping Cycle"".

15-06-19,3ackh2,How do you figure out a good formula to pay back an angel investor?,"Let's say you have an investor who wants to provide you $400k for a start up business. This would fund the initial start costs, equipment, as well as operating costs until a profit can be realized. It will take roughly 6-8 months for revenue to begin being generated. 

Only 5000 widgets will be created with this startup cost, but now that initial equipment has been purchased, it will be easy to have 5000 widgets coming off the line every 2 weeks and there is little problem with distribution as demand is very high. 

Given the high profitability of these widgets, whatever it had cost to get started, could essentially be made and paid back on the initial 400k. 

So what sort of incentive would an investor have to invest? Would such be interested in say a percentage from each widget batch for X amount of batches or time? Would you simply add interest for the time the money was invested plus a fee? Trying to figure what sounds like a great deal (because it is) but isn't giving the farm away.  

How would YOU structure an offer?   ",5
15-06-19,3acl5v,"Why do inverse ETF'S rebalance daily?","So my understanding was that leveraged ETF'S with a daily return objective had to rebalance daily because of this math:

You have a $100m fund seeking 3x daily index return. Fund acquires a $300m exposure to that index and the index rises 2% on day one. Fund asset value is now $106m but the exposure is now $306m, but it needs to be 3x asset value to achieve it's return goals, so the fund buys $12m more exposure. This is the necessary rebalancing process to my knowledge.

Yet it's clear the inverse ETF'S require daily rebalancing too. I just don't understand why. When your $100m short position grows to $102m after the reference index drops 2%, then fund asset value is now $102m as well. Future shifts in exposure should be matched to asset value 1:1 right? Why would a fund need to rebalance at all? 

I've read plenty of articles and yet they all show how decay happens, but not what that explicitly has to do with rebalancing. I feel like decay is just a natural side effect of tracking daily % returns for inverse ETFs, I don't get why these funds need to rebalance or why the rebalancing affects decay like it does for leveraged ETfs.

15-06-18,3aagk3,Is dividend investing the only game in town for older folks?,"The biggest risk that I think we all have to contend with is being fully  invested near the peak of a market that enters a multi decade bear run. Lots of folks here are pretty young and maybe could weather even a 20 year bear cycle. But many are also in their forties or fifties and even retired. Drawing down funds in a bear market is no fun. 

Considering the above I think dividend investing is likely to produce far better outcomes than investing in broad indices or stock picking growth/momentum plays.

If/when the next stock price crash comes upon us the only thing one can do is grin and bear while hoping for a recovery that may or may not materialize (see Japan's Nikkei) and collecting tiny dividends that market cap weighted indexes pay at present. 
Meanwhile someone holding a dividend heavy basket of stocks also bears the same paper loss but they can at least reinvest their dividends at lower prices producing an ever greater income stream over time that will hopefully support their retirement lifestyle no matter what the actual stock prices do over the long run. 

I see absolutely no way in which index investing would be safer than dividend investing for those of us who have less than 20 years until retirement/financial independence. 

One issue with dividend investing is that it's a form of stock picking. If diversification is a concern one can use a dividend oriented ETF like DVY or some others and sacrifice a bit of yield compared to stock picking. 

Investing in something which doesn't pay dividends seems to me like more of a speculation on a future price action than true investing.

15-06-18,3aagkq,Advice for when a buy-out is about to take place,"I'm a big ol' investing noob. I bought 60 shares of a stock NKA at around $2 back in February.

Anyway, it was recently announced that NKA is going to be purchased, with shareholders receiving a little over $4 in cash for each share. The price skyrocketed to about $3.75 when this was announced. My inclination is to just wait for this buy-out to happen and take then $4 a share. However, what if something goes wrong in the purchase? Should I just take the profits I have now and sell all my shares at 3.75?

Anyway, Exelixis is a small biotech company that tanked hard in 2014 after they had a phase 3 trial (COMET) for cometriq that did not meet it's primary end point of increasing median overall survival.  The good thing is that the current phase 3 trial METEOR has a primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS).  In the COMET trial of , Cometriq smashed the placebo, nearly tripling the PFS, indicating that the METEOR trial will more than likely meet it's primary end point.

These data were supposed to be released by Q2, but in a recent earnings report they pushed back the deadline because the rate at which events was occuring had slowed, and they now aim for late Q2/early Q3 for a data release.

15-06-18,3abbxe,WWAV vs Netflix,"Hey guys, I'm looking to make my first stock purchase and narrowed it down to these two choices.

I don't know a whole lot about stocks but figured a small investment could kickstart an interest.

I was debating either to buy $500 worth of stock in WWAV (WhiteWave Foods - they own Land of Lakes, Silk, Horizon Milk, and a few others) at ~$49 a share or going with a single share of Netflix at ~$665 for a single share.

The reason I've chosen WWAV is because of talks of being bought up by Coke.  Even if this doesn't happen, I see them as a solid company and a safe investment.  

Netflix, on the other hand, could see a stock split in the near future which could work out to my advantage.

So in your opinion, Reddit, ~10 shares in WWAV or 1 share in Netflix?

Any other suggestions are more than appreciated.

The formula I am using is Price=Eps x (8.5+2g). First in order to find the variable g in the above formula I calculate the companies ""Earning Growth Rate."" I do this by dividing the latest earnings per share number (2.04) by the earliest earnings per share number (1.76)

2.04/1.76=1.159 (the growth multiple)

Next I raise the growth multiple to the power of 1/2 because the time period being measured is 2 years.

I do not know 100% where to spend this money or where to hold onto it as. I am trying this subreddit in hopes for answers but would also like advice on other subreddits I can go as well. 


Below is some more information about myself.

How old are you? 22

Are you employed/making income? How much? I am currently not making that much, two jobs and around 400 to 600 a week. 

What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?) Not entirely sure what to do with the money, do not want to waste it all and have nothing. Would like it to grow and make me comfortable with a head start. 
	I would like to go back to college. I was in college in California but decided to move to Colorado. Would like to establish residence here first in order to save money on tuition then go back to college full time while having a part time job on the side. I feel as though this money might help with that.
	Was wondering what the usual taxes are when taking out inheritance? The will states 200,000 but I do not know if that is taxed or not. 

What is your risk tolerance? I have a low risk tolerance, I do not want to blow it all or lose it.

What are you current holdings? $2,000 in the bank and scraping by. $1,200 in Credit card debit, I usually try to keep $200 on credit card to keep my score high but since January it has been difficult. $2,500 in student loan debt with $50 payments every month.

Credit Score? Last time I checked (few months back) I had a 732.

Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? I have an old car (1995 civic)

15-06-18,3abeb3,Question about opening brokerage account as a future employee of a FINRA member firm affiliate,"I'm interested in opening a brokerage account with Schwab. On the application, there is a checkbox for ""I am affiliated with or employed by a stock exchange, member firm of an exchange or FINRA, or a municipal securities broker-dealer.” 

I start work in a couple months for a company in the finance industry. The firm that I will be working for is an affiliate of a FINRA member firm. I've reviewed the company's trading policy, which does not prohibit personal securities transactions. It explicitly prohibits the use of information gained from clients or trades that would be considered insider trading. 

I'm not worried about violating the law or my employer's policy about trades as I'm just going to play around with ETFs or stocks with some spare money, being mindful to avoid anything tied to client interests. 

My issue is whether or not to check the box: if I do, I can't open the account without a letter from my employer stating that it's fine for me to do so, which they would provide. However, I don't work there yet, so I don't think I'd be obliged to check the box. Correct? 

If I go forward without checking the box and then begin my employment, does the employment change need to be somehow reported?",1

My only debt is 4 years left paying off a car that I bought brand new last year (950 bucks a month).

It's basically a combination of recent highs, fear from the previous crash, and the fact that in the next 5 years, baby boomers are reaching peak retirement age (and most people who use full-service brokers are old-ass dinosaurs).

I've got a pretty simple question here.... is $1,000 enough to start investing **reasonably**?  
  
  
Some more about me... I'm 22 years old, in college majoring in accounting or marketing .. Have not decided yet. I do currently have my marketing certificate of achievement completed. I've also taken an investing course where I learned all about the different types of stocks, bonds, MF's , etc. Along with technical / fundamental analysis , etc.   
  
  
However, that investing class was 1.5 years ago and since then I've wanted to get into investing and start my portfolio. However, with part time work and A LOT of expenses, I've only managed to acquire an extra $1,000 in 1.5 years towards my investing budget.   
  
  
I'd love to have more money to work with, especially because if things go bad and I lose that $1,000 it's about the only disposable income I have ( after rent, expenses , food, etc ).  
  
  
However, one thing I learned in my classes is the power of time. It's been 1.5 since I took my investing class and I've seen the indexes steadily rise over that time and I'm bummed out that I missed the oppurunuty to invest in certain stocks. Soooo, with the $1,000 I have now, is it worth it to get started?

In a hypothetical investment I would go short on ASE index and sell the part of the position before the meeting. Plus shorting banks and hedging on franc. I would leave eurozone out, because, even though I know that Euro countries (even the countries starting to step out of the crisis) have prepare themselves for this, by cutting unnecessary ties (if I can call that), the european banking 'aid' to Greece was already defaulted, so the banks that had to go under for excessive exposition to Greece, have already go under, countries in general are living with tighter budgets, but we never know how the market (hedge funds and investment banking) will react if something goes sour.   
But in other hand, to go sour, Greece would have to pull a bunch of billions out of their asses and a bunch of other miracles had to happen, so shorting Greece this week is a pretty good deal, even if they continue in Europe, as if there is a raise on the Greece markets, it will be a light bump, but will justify the possible gains if Greece goes under. After the mess is done, the ASE goes back into stable prices, I think a long position will make sense, as Greece will have to come back to drachma (meaning, cheap labour) + even-though they are out, their business ties with europe will continue to exist.  
  
Or Greece will have a overvalued currency in order to pay some of their debt and the 80's will repeat themselves.

So, I've been a ""long time"" investor (I'm a 30 year old engineer and I've been privately investing for about 8 years). I've had plenty of wins and I've gotten good at picking stocks/ETFs that I'm comfortable with owning and judging (AMBA, TSLA, AAPL, CRM and, BLUE to name a few). And, I of course, have a default ""bunch"" of SPY and a little BRK.B.

I've also always kept some ""stupid risk"" stuff lying around. For example, I have ~1000 shares of PIMCO's high income fund (PHK). It's a close-ended fund that has historically paid $0.12/month in dividends. It's a risky SOB, but I'm dollar-cost averaged in VERY low (bought a lot during the 2008-2009 crash).

I've become accustomed to the trend of PHK, but [this particular downturn](https://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=maximized&amp;chdeh=0&amp;chfdeh=0&amp;chdet=1434744000000&amp;chddm=98532&amp;chls=IntervalBasedLine&amp;q=NYSE:PHK&amp;ntsp=1&amp;ei=t06EVbH4JqSUe8XbgJAH) doesn't seem associated with anything unless it's a delayed response to Bill Gross' departure.

15-06-21,3akgg0,How to invest US$100k to supplement monthly income?,"Dear /r/investing, 

I'm leaving a stable job in Brazil to start a PhD in Computer Science in the US this Fall, looking for a more fulfilling career. My stipend will be US$30k/year, with tuition and health insurance paid for. My estimated costs for housing + utilities will be around 1.5k/month. I don't plan to buy a car and I'm not sure about other expenses (will live in Philly). I'm married and my wife won't be allowed to work because of the visa type, so I need to provide for her, including health insurance. I'm 30, and the prospect for jobs after graduating is good (although we can't predict the market 5+ years from now).

On the bright side, I have US$100k in a US account (I worked abroad for a few years and my employer paid me in US dollars in a US account). I also have the equivalent to US$100k in Brazilian Reais (BRL) in Brazilian accounts. My Brazilian investments are mostly in treasury bonds, which are currently paying a whooping 14%/year; however, they're not guaranteed to stay like that and it is very hard to predict the exchange rate to the US dollar.

So I'm looking to invest US$100k to supplement my monthly stipend. The Vanguard Managed Payout Fund (VPGDX) seems a good option; not sure if it is the best.

I've also considered transferring my US funds to Brazil and profit on the high interests here, but this looks quite risky.

Transferring Brazilian funds to the US is very expensive because of taxes and fees. For instance, there is a 6,38% tax on every credit card purchase made abroad with a Brazilian card.

I could live comfortably with my wife during the PhD if I spent all my USD savings, but I think there must be some way to avoid that. I hope that with a good investment in the US and the earnings from my Brazilian investments I could come out of graduate school with the same net worth. Any advice? Thanks!",137

But, that’s OK. The revenue growth is staggering, $50 million in sales last year and they are on track to do $750 million this year. And they are profitable making $150 million on that revenue. Already in 2015 their monthly run rate is north of $1 billion.

&gt; So apart from those great growth statistics why does FitBit (NYSE:FIT) deserve such a high PE ration? 
&gt; Well here are my four main reasons for this analysis.

**1. They are making tech fashionable**

Remember the Google Glass? Yeah, well I sure do and while it WAS a cool piece of technology it just wasn’t fashionable and the users were labeled has voyeurs or creeps. Interacting with a Google glass user ran you the risk of being secretly video recorded and they were subsequently BANNED from pubs, schools, churches, and many other public areas.

So what are Fitbit going to do to get over this stigma against wearable technology? Well they have partnered with Tory Burch, a New York based ladies fashion designer who has made the Fitbit cool for girls and woman alike. The strategy behind this is the key, they get the kudos of an internationally recognised brands, they get another 100 outlets on wear to sell their technology and they get to increase their margins hugely to the average consumer.
 
**2. They are expanding into other smart devices**

Fitbit are not limiting themselves to just fitness trackers. No, far from it. They will be expanding their technology into every facet of your lives to help measure and improve their users lives. It’s not hard to think about having fitbit trackers built into refrigerators, bedside tables and even your lampshade to naturally wake you up and track your sleeping patterns. If you already are carrying a Fitbit on your body as you enter the house what a wonderful way to use this as your remote control, signalling ahead that you will be arriving home in 10 minutes to switch on the lights and heating (air conditioning).

Think about Nest, the home technology company acquired by Google last year. They initially created a thermostat but with the Google funding and investment behind them they have branched out into Fire Alarms and with a recent announcement this week into personal security cameras. I actually wonder if the announcement was timed to take a little steam off of the Fitbit IPO engine.

We’ve discussed smart bits, smart fridges, thermostats, fire alarms, lights and security cameras but think of the range of possibilities that Fitbit can expand into without even being a direct competitor of Google’s Nest. I believe there will be a day when they go head to head but it may be much much later.

So far Fitbit has announced a Smart Scale, which makes sense and continues along the fitness line, but it’s definitely a warning shot that they are coming for your bedroom, your kitchen, your garage and your entire household.

**3. Revenue Model (Not your average tech company)** 

Many tech companies are characterised with a simple standard sales cycle where a user purchases the item, uses it for 2-5 years and then needs to upgrade. Think about buying your laptop, you purchased it, didn’t need to pay another dime to the computer company to use the laptop and when this dies you will purchase another. Well Fitbit is moving away from this kind of sales. Yes, that is part of their strategy but they also are offering premium subscription models in the form of “Fitbit Premium”

Fitbit Premium costs $49.95 per year and while not yet publically available on the website (ends up in a 404 error) it is available through a little sleuth with Google Cache Copy. I’ve attached a screen grab below.

**4. Defensible Tech: They are making sport specific devices**

Fitbit recently announced the Fitbit Surge devices especially engineered for cyclists. The strategy of making specific devices for popular niches such as cycling, running, skiing, golf etc. will lead to their product being alot more defensible then other products on the market.

Yes, we all know that I have failed to mention the 800 pound Gorilla that is hanging over Fitbit and beating it’s chest, it’s Apple. Apple has a giant chest of funds which they can use to compete against any product on the market today. But Apple’s strategy is not to create many products, they usually do one thing really good and keep it basic. For example the Macbook and Macbook Pro hasn’t branched out into tens of models like other manufacturers, no they kept it simple with a premium and economy version of the laptops and people loved the simplicity.

The same thing will be true for the Apple Watch. If they make a cycling version a running version then they will just confuse the people who use and buy the products. Therefore it will always be only average for those who are truly fans of these sports.

I've been in MORL for several months now, with a DRIP program. I like the high dividend yield, however I'm uncomfortable with the price in a long term decline. Once the price fell below $20/share, I was no longer profitable. Maybe with the coming large dividend payout next month while it is priced so low I'll be able to up the share count and bring down my average. But none of that will matter if the price doesn't rise again!

I haven't been contributing to my Roth IRA in several years (shame on me, I know) and would like to put all of the bond money into the IRA. 

Am I better off just dumping it all in at once (assuming a diversified mutual fund like Vanguard Star or something like that), or spreading out the contribution for the rest of the year? I know that dollar-cost averaging comes into play somewhat, but I also am not planning on touching the money for another 20-30 years, so I feel like any gains from spreading out will be negligible during this period of time.

15-06-21,3alua9,Thinking about YOLOing $AKBA,"About to pull the trigger on this pick, but wanted to get some thoughts first.

The biopharmaceutical company is Akebia Therepeutics.  They are developing a once daily, orally taken medicine based on hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) biology (your body's reaction to altitude that creates more red blood cells) to eventually treat patients with kidney disease. It has completed a Phase IIb study demonstrating that AKB-6548 can raise hemoglobin levels in non-dialysis patients with anemia related to chronic kidney disease (CKD). 

Blah, Blah, Blah...The Company is also conducting a Phase II study for the treatment of anemia in patients undergoing dialysis. The Company's preclinical candidate, AKB-6899, is a small molecule with minor structural differences from its lead compound AKB-6548. AKB-6899 is being developed for the treatment of certain cancers....Blah, Blah, Blah.

Anyway,

I think it looks good because despite a sizable drop from $29 there seems to be some support at $8 by shareholders, 30% of which are investment managers.  Also, the company has a market cap of $230mm and the chairman, Muneer Satter, just purchased $3.5mm worth of stock. The company also has $109mm on the balance sheet and only $7mm in liabilities. I think this stock could get a small bump after they present this Tuesday at the JMP Securities Life Sciences Conference, and when they eventually release hopefully positive results of their latest study I think it could shoot up very quickly.  Overall I think this company could eventually commercialize an important product or simply be acquired.

15-06-21,3alzzb,"I'm about to send $50k to a stranger on the internet. Is this a bad idea?","So I noticed the guy who writes the [OTC Adventures blog](http://www.otcadventures.com) has a fund called Alluvial Capital. A presentation on the fund is available here - http://alluvialcapital.com/why-alluvial/.

Why might investing in this fund be a bad idea? Some things I thought of:

* It's one guy - he might get hit by a bus, get bored, etc.
* The micro cap stuff he invests in is inherently riskier than regular investments.
* Relatively high management fees (2% of AUM and 10% of profits). **EDIT:** *""2.00% of assets for accounts below $100,000, or 10% of net performance, with a high water mark. The 10% of net performance option is only available to high net worth, qualified clients"" (as seen below)*
* Short track record - he's only been posting since 2012 and his fund has only been operational since last year.

Update: on the positive side, if you look at his past performance, he's consistently beaten comparable indices and other indices like VTI. (This is net of management fees.) His blog is also very well-informed and well-researched.

The thesis in investing here is that because it's a smaller fund investing in micro-caps it's more possible to find value. This is in line with [Warren Buffett's thinking on smaller amounts of money](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett):

    If I was running $1 million today, or $10 million for that matter, I'd be fully invested. Anyone who says that size does not hurt investment performance is selling. The highest rates of return I've ever achieved were in the 1950s. I killed the Dow. You ought to see the numbers. But I was investing peanuts then. It's a huge structural advantage not to have a lot of money. I think I could make you 50% a year on $1 million. No, I know I could. I guarantee that.",0

Here's a link to [historical 10 year bond yields] (http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/IRLTLT01USM156N). I did a quick check on Wal-Mart's performance in two time periods to see if it could explain the stock's behaviour.
From 2004-2007, last time interest rates were raised, WMT fell from $60 to $45. WMT's ROA in the [same period](http://c46b2bcc0db5865f5a76-91c2ff8eba65983a1c33d367b8503d02.r78.cf2.rackcdn.com/54/28/99680b2247be83b3f9f220c9645b/2008-annual-report-for-walmart-stores-inc_130221019979211599.pdf) fell from 9.8% to 8.4%. However, WMT's 
ROA declined from 9.1% to 8.1% from 2011 to end 2014, yet the stock ran up from $55 all the way to $90. Puzzling.

Why is this the case? Does the CNBC explanation (that higher interest rates imply that consumers have less to spend) hold water? Does this mean investors should avoid WMT if they believe long term rates will go up?",1

Which is fantastic!

However, a lot has changed since then in terms of the new warrant structure, amount of shares that institutional investors hold, and of course, market cap.

So, here's the question: At $1.04, is TPIV still undervalued? (The short answer is **""Yup""**, but let's find out why.) 

&amp;nbsp;

[Click Here for Chart 1:](http://i.imgur.com/lX95oYr.png)

&amp;nbsp;

The two most important numbers to note are:

**Total Shares: 37,638,810**

**Total Shares after all warrants are exercised: 120,765,602**

&amp;nbsp;


These numbers are important because like any good investor knows - these numbers affect our market cap. And the value of TPIV's market cap and the market cap of their competitors is what we'll be using to evaluate what we anticipate TPIV's share price to be in the coming months. 

With 37,638,810 shares at a price of $1.04 cents (Closing as of 6/18/2015), TPIV has a market cap of 39.25M.

That's nothing. That's a pathetically small market cap. 

&amp;nbsp;

ONTY has a market cap of 400 million, and is just as far along as TPIV, if not a little bit behind them in terms of pipeline.
http://www.oncothyreon.com/product_pipeline/pipeline.html 

GALE has a market cap of 300 million, and is even farther in the FDA than TPIV, albeit they have an inferior product. They also have two commercial products that generate revenue.
http://galenabiopharma.com/pipeline/

&amp;nbsp;

But, wait. TPIV has a ton of warrants that need to be exercised. If there were no restrictions on when the warrants could be exercised, and all the warrants were converted to shares tomorrow, then TPIV would have a market cap of (120,765,602 shares x $1.04) = 125.59M

&amp;nbsp;

ONTY = 400M

GALE = 300M

TPIV(If all the warrants are exercised and the share price stays the same) 125.59M 

&amp;nbsp;

Cool, so it's already pretty undervalued, right? However, let's consider a couple of things:

TapImmune is a debt-free company, with very strong data on a product that is going to leave GALE's treatment for triple-negative breast cancer in the dust, assuming both drugs get approved. (Study shows TapImmune's product as having 5x the effectiveness of Galena's, despite Galena's being in Phase 3. They're making the original IPhone over there, while TapImmune is already working on creating the IPhone 5)

ONTY has some cool stuff going on, but TPIV is about to be much farther along in the process than they are, and I'd argue that TPIV has the more robust pipeline.

So, at the VERY MINIMUM, TPIV should have a market cap of 200 million, and it could very well have a market cap up to 400 million like ONTY if the data keeps looking good.

Now that we know that TPIV is still very undervalued, we have to consider that the exercise of warrants play a big part in just how undervalued it is. So, let's look at these warrants. 

&amp;nbsp;

[Click here for Chart 2:](http://i.imgur.com/S9rZQzx.png)

&amp;nbsp;

I'm going to start out by saying that I feel misled by TapImmune's press release and the SC 13D/A's that they filed. They led me (and likely many people) to believe that only Kenneth Dart was the recipient of a lowered bar for entry on the warrants as well as double the B&amp;C warrants. It turns out that ALL institutional investors who participated in the January offering were the recipient of lowered warrant bars and extra warrants.
However, on the other side of the coin, it's my fault for not doing the math.

&amp;nbsp;

The Press Release:

----
SEATTLE, June 2, 2015 /PRNewswire/ – TapImmune, Inc. (TPIV), a clinical stage cancer immunotherapy company, and its institutional investors have reached an agreement whereby the institutional investors will have the option to exercise their short term warrants to provide the Company up to $4.93M in near term funding, pending closing conditions and an effective S-1 registration statement
---- 


What they meant by **""4.93M in near-term funding""** was the complete exercising of the B-Series warrants.

14,640,000 Series B warrants + 10,000,000 Series B-1 warrants = 24,600,000 warrants

24,600,000 warrants at an exercise price of .20 cents = **$4.93M**

It turns out that TapImmune had no idea that Kenneth Dart would exercise the C-1 warrants and give them an extra *$2.5M in funding.* That was a BIG added bonus for them.

On the other hand, the doubling of the B&amp;C warrants for all institutional investors means that's a total of 24,600,000 warrants that were added to the pool, which means when all the warrants are exercised, there will be an extra dilution of 15% to total share count that we didn't have before.

But, more a bit later on why that's likely just fine. 

&amp;nbsp;

What I really want you to take away from looking at the warrant structure is about the Series A warrants.
Series A warrants (12,320,000 of them) can't be exercised until November 28th. That's a long time away, and a lot can change until then. Let's completely strike them from our valuation for now. TPIV max market cap at current share price drops to 112.78M.

&amp;nbsp;

ONTY = 400M

GALE: 300M

TPIV: 112.78M if all warrants were exercised and this share price held until November 28th.

&amp;nbsp;

So, here we go... And this is where it gets important.

&amp;nbsp;

Like I said earlier, at the VERY MINIMUM, TPIV should have a market cap of 200 million, and it could very well have a market cap up to 400 million like ONTY if the data keeps looking good.
So, let's assume that all of the warrants (aside from the A-1's) get exercised on the next trading day (Which, isn't going to happen. But, humor me.) Our market cap would then be 112.78M.

In order to get to a minimum of **200M** market cap (which is what this company deserves at the very very least), that's going to be a share price of **$1.77**.

A market cap of **300M**, which is still a completely fair evaluation given the strength of the data, that's going to be **$2.66** per share.

A market cap of **400M**, which is a stretch, but again… ONTY has that high of a market cap, and they're at the same stage as TPIV… means a price of **$3.54.**

After reading that, if you're a conservative investor, I know what you're thinking: Wow, shit. I'm just going to set my limit at a few pennies below $1.77 and walk off into the sunset with my profits. 

You would be very, very wrong to do that if you're holding long. If none of the warrants get exercised, then even a price of $3.54 would be a pathetic 66.7M market cap.

There's a reason why the Black-Scholes model for warrants exists. It's because people aren't going to exercise their warrants in predictable ways.

Hell, look at Kenneth Dart. No one predicted that he was going to exercise his C-1's. Not even TapImmune. They counted on the B-1 warrants to be exercised, and nothing else. They just got 2.5 million dollars that they didn't anticipate on having.

&amp;nbsp;

So, that brings us to the final question? Where is a good place to sell, assuming that nothing that we aren't already anticipating comes out between now and November 28th?

It sure as hell isn't $1.77. You're selling yourself very short by doing that, and if you sell there, I'll gladly pick up your shares.

It's probably not as high as $3.54 either, unless things stay as precisely as smooth at they're going now. (And things are going very smooth right now.)

If things start to get choppy, and there is less-than-perfect news, but still progress, then between $2-3 is a good target.

If things are going well, then look for the stock to blow a $2.50 barrier out of the water. When we enter Phase 2, look for the stock to trade between $2.50-4 dollars until more news comes out. 

Most importantly, **watch the warrants.** Take note when they're exercised. By no means is warrant exercise a bad thing. TapImmune **NEEDS** money to operate or they will go bankrupt and their progress won't mean anything.

They also need money in order to get uplisted to the Nasdaq. You have to show a minimum shareholder equity in order to do that.

**Warrants are the lifeblood of the company's financial state.** So, respect them. It's not a negative thing when they get exercised, so there is no reason for the stock price to go down, unless the company is overvalued when they're exercised.

For example... if TPIV is trading at 500M market cap, and all of a sudden, 10 million warrants are exercised. Then, the share price will go down.

But, otherwise, look for the share price to increase when companies start exercising their B-1's. They need this money for Phase 2 in order to continue progressing further into the pipeline. These warrant exercises are a positive event.

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, a list of catalysts that are going to propel this stock forward in the next 90 days:

1. The continued exercise of B-1 warrants that will give the company the cash they need for Phase II.

2. The release of final Phase I data. Should be sometime this week or early next week.

3. Applying for fast-track designation / Phase II with the FDA. (Approval in the next 60-90 days)

4. Applying for orphan status for their drug. (Approval in the next 60-90 days) (These last two are the big ones. As soon as approval hits, expect a price between $2-3. And the data is damn near flawless. It's a perfectly safe treatment, and all 13 trial patients showed a greatly heightened immune response. There is no reason why the FDA would deny a Phase II.)

&amp;nbsp;

That's my spiel. Hopefully you learned something!

I recently posted a thread about how my brokerage account was started so I could ""play around"" with some money but I kept funding it and it had done pretty well, so I was worried because that shit was getting serious. 

Well I discovered that Fidelity lets you create and name multiple brokerage accounts under your name. So I took advantage of this and split investments into two sections: 

1. Buy and Hold funds which has most of the money and has broad investments and I will not touch it. 

2. Play money which has just a little bit so I can still actively tinker around.

15-06-22,3annn8,Renting part of your house or basement long term,"Every other Monday, we look at real estate as a way to make money. I have explained why I believe real estate is one of the best ways to grow wealth, and gone over a check list for first time investors. Today, we look at doing with what you already have, that is renting part of your house or your basement to a new tenant.

 

Being a live in landlord
 

Being a live in landlord has a lot of perks. First, you are on the property first hand, so you can see if in spite of you tenant’s background check, something is still off. A tenant who is good on paper can be noisy, put a lot of wear and tear on your property by slamming the doors, or try to sneak in a pet in spite of your no pet policy. By living on the property, you can straighten things up from the start. Chances are “bad” tenants will avoid you from the start, and only good tenants will move in.

I have lived with two roommates in a place I owned and it was much better, at least for me, than the previous houseshares I had lived in with no landlord around. The landlord would come once a quarter, take days to fix something, and no one would care about the property. With a live in landlord, people behave better, and the landlord is there to solve any problem. The property should be in better shape, as no landlord likes to live in a dump.

The thing I liked the most as a live in landlady was that you could evict the tenant with no notice. In the UK the rules are pretty strict about tenant protection if you rent the whole property. But if you live there, you just have to change the locks and put the tenant’s stuff outside your property, and you are good. I never did it, but on every interview, I made sure the tenant understood it was a possibility if they were late on rent or started damaging the property. I don’t know if the threat deterred the worst tenants but I never had a problem.

 

 

Setting the rent of your property
 

If you bought your main residence, you probably have a mortgage, and have had to put a good chunk of money down. You may even have opted for a 15 years mortgage or be making extra payments to pay it off faster. If your normal mortgage was $1,000 a month but you are paying $3,000, it doesn’t mean that your tenant has to pay half of that.

You need to align with the market prices for similar properties. On Craigslist and other ad boards, you can find the rates to rent a bedroom in a houseshare, and a basement or attic with independent access. To make a faire comparison with the market you need to compare all the amenities you are offering.

 

- Will the tenant just have access to a room or also living room and kitchen?

- Will the tenant be able to use your washer and dryer?

- Are you renting furnished or unfurnished?

- Is the entrance separate or through your living room?

- Will the tenant have a parking space?

- What bills are you including?

- Are taxes and insurance included too?

- Are you offering a peer to peer relationship, say you are in your mid 20s taking on other college kids or young professionals, or is it your family house and you take in a boarder who won’t be able to choose what movie to watch on TV tonight?

 

In my property, I have opted for an all inclusive rate. Everyone is happy, the tenants because the do not need to budget for the bills every month, they know exactly what their housing costs will be, and me because I don’t have to make complicated calculations to split the bills, send each of them a recap counting pennies, and get bitter if they spend too much time in the shower or do laundry too often.

 

Day to day living with a tenant
 

If the tenant lives in a room inside your property, you want to set clear rules from the start. When is it ok to make noise, can he have company over, can company stay the night, how many nights maximum before it becomes double occupancy and both have to pay rent, etc.

Imagine an abusive little brother crashing at your place for months, what would you like to tell him from day 1? Tell that to your tenant FROM DAY 1. After you become friends or discover you can’t stand each other, communication will be harder. How do you tell a friend to do dishes? To clean after himself? Give them a copy of house rules when they move in, and talk as soon as there is a problem.

Set boundaries about rooms the tenant cannot go into, it is better if each person has a key to his or her room to avoid problems, and a shelf in the kitchen, fridge and bathroom. Make space for them so they feel welcome but define your space too.

 

Attic, basement and separate unit
 

This is the best of both worlds. Instead of having to supervise a rental property far from home, you have it right above or under you, yet your tenants do not invade your space. Maybe your driveway and garden, but you will have set rules for that in your contract as well. Renting a separate unit counts as a full tenancy, and the live in landlord eviction rights do not apply. One more reason to be very thorough with your tenant’s background check.

Be discreet and leave them space, but also keep an eye for any suspect behavior, extra people staying overnight too often, are they living there, are they keeping the property in good shape, etc.

NEVER, ever even start thinking about grabbing an extra key and checking the inside of their property while they are away. It is illegal in many places and the tenant could sue you. If you have a doubt, ask nicely if they would let you in for an inspection, and if not, what is their reason.

Having them close is also very convenient to chase late payments.",1

15-06-22,3apqa4,I just met with the AMD CEO,"This story sounds nuts, and you'll probably think this is crazy but ITS TRUE.

I was walking home, and there was a hudge flash of light and I was on my back, daized.  Everyone was gathered around me and I heard whispers ""why is he naked"", ""call the po"" and then out of nowhere a friendly hand grabbed me and pulled me up.

They said they have a schpecial massage for me, from the future.  Come with them to their house.

I went to the house.  

They came and brought me a blanket and made me a coffee.  Then they sat down and looked me straight in the eye:

""I am the AMD CEO from the year 2035.  I have come here to warn you about AMD and to send a message to your yolowers.

It was around in late 2015 that AMD went moon, and hit $20 a share.  The management were about to fold the company, but all the yolowers buying calls encouraged them to work a bit later, try a bit harder.

Simply put, it worked.  The stock shot to $20.""

At this point I was literally so excited to get back on my mac and let you all know about this.  But then they carried on

""After that, AMD got carried away.  They developed true AI.  The stock went up and up, there were even newspaper articles about how the trades on WSB are now the worlds wealthy elite.  Some of them retired in piles of cash, others gambled it all away on pharma.  you've never seen phatter gainz than the 2015 onwards runup of AMD.""

Even more good news

""But then the AMD AI took over the company and shat on the world.  Everyone died and it was horrible.  I only survived because I have a time machine but the batteries just run out.   I'm here to warn WSB, stop investing in AMD or you will become filthy rich and live in luxury for a few decades but is it worth it because then everyone will die later on"".

I asked if the AMD investors would be safe

""Yes, but that's not the point.  The AMD gainz kept the yolowers safe and sound in an off earth base, it was like heaven and wonderous built by AMD.  But back on earth, everyone else was hurting and not fun no"".

It then got a bit weireded because we ended up holding hands and cuddling a bit.  Before I left to walk home they asked for the blanket back.

I KNOW THIS IS RIDICULOUS BUT IM JUST THE MASSAGNER.  STOP BUYING AMD OR WE WILL BE FILTHY RICH AT THE EXPENSIVE OF THE REST OF THE WORLD.

15-06-23,3asjn9,Heard an interesting investing group/method described to me. Wondering if there is an actual name for it?,"I heard about this from a non-English speaker so I don't have an English name for it, hoping someone can help me out. 

So the gist of it goes like this. You have a number of people ( lets say 30 for example) who put in money ($1000) every month into the pot. Then all 30 ppl will bid for that pot of $30,000. 

The bidding goes like this, you put down a dollar amount from 0-1000, and whatever amount you put that is lower than 1000, you have to pay the difference for the other 29 people if you win.

A. bid 900, B bids 950, C bids 930, everyone else didn't want to bid. 

So the winning bid is A, which means the 29 people only have to put in 900 into the pot and A will chip in the rest (29*100=2900).

A gets that money ( 30k-2900-1k(A's own contribution to pot)=26.1k to use for whatever he wants.   

month 2: Same rules, except A has to put in 1000 no matter what and is not allowed to bid anymore. This time B wins. 

Month 3: Same rules, except A and B can't bid. 
And on and on. 

Month 30: The last person is the only bidder left, so they bid 1000, so it's a zero percent interest. But its basically the last person getting his investment back. So he gets 30k but he didn't put in 30k because each month, the winning bidder footed part of his 1000 deposit. So depending on how aggressive the bids were, he could have made a decent amount of money. 

Any questions? or need clarifications? Just ask me. 

Edit: So I found out what it's called:

A friend and I have made an app called [Bullseye](http://www.joinbullseye.com) that combines the stock market with a private group chat experience. We are in the super early stages, but have been beta testing with various groups such as 3 friends that follow the market together to university investment groups from top business schools around the country. 

&amp;nbsp;

We have a pretty unique design that users love - when people make comments in the group you can actually see when the comment was posted in context to the performance of the stock. View more [here](http://www.joinbullseye.com). So you'll see all of /r/WallStreetBets wins and fails right on the stocks.

&amp;nbsp;

We have opened up the beta test to with more people so I thought it would be great to get your feedback to see what sucks and what works for the /r/WallStreetBets community.

&amp;nbsp;

Bullseye isn't anonymous like Reddit, but instead meant to specifically talk stocks with people you know so if /r/WallStreetBets is interested in your own 'WallStBets' group - you would all be personally connected with your real names, but you can invite people and create your own groups too. 

&amp;nbsp;

Bullseye is completely free, secure, private and is currently only for iOS. Bullseye is entirely bootstrapped -we're just a designer and developer who follow the market and occasionally place our own bets.

The biggest thing that pushed me to buy it is how much cash they are sitting on. They have $60 in cash per share and shares are trading at $30.83 right now. Also, they just spent $490M buying back shares and on top of that, three insiders in the company just spent almost $500K buying shares for themselves in the last two months. 

Their P/E is higher than I would like, but their profits have grown very steadily over the last 10 years.

Is this even possible while I am in business school or can it only be achieved by being out in the industry with a mentor? If it is possible to do by myself, how would I go about doing it?

15-06-22,3aqsnv,"I'm devising a strategy for investing in sports cards. Please critique.","So, after months of research, I think I have a way to actually make money with sports cards.

First of all, it is widely known that sports cards spike in value when the player receives any kind of award. Rookies cards also go for a higher price than any other card of that player.

After some research, I found a card of Steph Curry (who recently won MVP) sell on ebay for $700. I also found the exact same card of Victor Oladipo (Has enough potential to possibly win MVP in his career) sell for $25. I crossed referenced enough sports players to find out that this is pretty standard among players. People don't pay for potential, they pay for what's already happened.

The strategy: Buy up mid-high end rookie cards of rookies that have potential. You don't even have to watch games to know who has potential (although it helps) if you know how to read the stat sheet, that tells the tale pretty good.

When one of your rookies wins an award 3-4 years down the road, sell.

Obviously flipping a $25 card for $700 because your guy won MVP is the best case scenario, but they shoot up to a lesser extent for getting a ring, and other awards.

So even if your guy is a flop, you can hold out until he gets a ring, which is a team effort, and probably make at least 30%.

I know a lot of people like to buy baseball cards from 100 years ago and watch them increase 2% per year. I feel like something like this is higher risk and reward, and you don't need $500,000 to buy one card.",2

&amp;nbsp;

**General notes:**

The bot currently runs in 1+min loops. Reddit's API also has a limit of 30 calls per minute (every 2 seconds). Since I don't expect a HUGE influx of usage, I have not optimized this part, the bot will essentially wait 2 seconds after each call, and then wait 1 minute after processing all messages it has received. Therefore, if the bot receives 10 messages in that period, you could be waiting up to 2min 20sec to get a response. I feel this is reasonable, but am wondering you guys feedback, I could easily shorten the time.

&amp;nbsp;

**How to call the bot**

You can either send a direct (private) message to 'wsbbot' or call the bot from a comment by using '+/u/wsbbot' followed by your action (don't include the '').You also should be able to put any text before or after the syntax and it should still pick it up. If you make more that 1 request from the same message, it should only respond to the first request.

&amp;nbsp;

**Currently working features to test:**

&amp;nbsp;

*Buy/Sell stock or options*

Usage: {buy|sell} {ticker} at ${price}

**The $ is now optional**

example: `buy 1000 AMD at $2.29`

example 2: `sell 1000 AMD at $30`

Expected result: The bot should respond with your current position and realized p/l for that ticker

&amp;nbsp;

*Check stats of a user*

Usage: userstats {username}

example: `userstats kevintb7`

Expected result: The bot should respond with the total profit for that user, as well as the current open positions.

&amp;nbsp;

*Check stats of a ticker*

Usage: tickerstats {ticker}

example `tickerstats AMD`

Expected result: The bot should respond with the total WSB realized P/L for that ticker, current overall WSB position, and current open positions with the user, quantity and price of each.

&amp;nbsp;

*Show recent Trades*

Usage: show recent trades

example: `show recent trades`

Expected result: The bot should respond with a table with the 10 most recent trades.

&amp;nbsp;

*Show Top Traders*

Usage: show top traders

example: `show top traders`

Expected Result: The bot should respond with a table of up to the 15 top traders based on Return on Risk Average. The bot will currently return regardless of whether a trade is verified or not, but will give the user that info. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Next Features I'm Working**

*Cheaters*

Currently, people can cheat. I have code so the bot verifies the trade price against yahoo finance every night. However, it only really shows that in the recent trades feature which is kinda useless, because it cant verify a trade made until after 12AM UTC (when yahoo updates data). I didn't want this to hinder people too much, so I didn't really incorporate it in any of the logic. I think I will just add a small thing to the 'userstats' command that shows how many times a particular user 'cheated'. I haven't tested this for options symbols, not sure if it will work. 

*Betting*

This will be a feature entirely different than the trades. Instead you will bet that a ticker hits a price by a date. The bot will check yahoo finance every night, and keep track if you are right/wrong. As well as your total gains when right? Maybe? I'm curious if people will like this better than the current functionality of trading. If so, anyone that wants to help with the logic please message me. 

*Help command*

Obviously, if you message the bot help, it should respond with something helpful.

*Copy trade/bet feature*

Quick way for people to jump on the bandwagon. Once released, users will use the bot in the comments. I want to add a feature so you can just reply to the bots response saying ""copy"" or ""Opposite"" (maybe) and the bot will copy the bet/trade to your profile.

&amp;nbsp;

Mods, please message me if there are any issues, I meant to get formal permission first, but a few of you testing were mods i believe. Please message me with any questions. I will comment this post with some examples.

Special thanks to those of you that tested:

**DISCLAIMER:** The information this bot provides is for amusement, do not use as investing advice.

&amp;nbsp;

EDIT: it appears the bot is getting rate limited severely on commenting (needs to wait 10min). It needs more karma, but it will respond very quickly to direct messages FYI.

EDIT 2: The $ is now optional. Also fixed a few bugs, and a grammar error, thanks all!

i'm basically living paycheck to paycheck. i currently don't have an emergency fund and i'm leasing a car that costs way more than i should be paying. i also have $19k in student loans and $2k in credit card debt (fortunately i'm not delinquent on any of my payments).

15-06-24,3aya2q,Investing in Stocks vs. Advance Paying Mortgage,"**tl;dr - I think it's better to pay ahead on my mortgage than invest in the stock market. I explain my logic and would love feedback / to understand if my logic is wrong!**

edit up top: My math is wrong. I mistook savings over 30 years for instantaneous savings, which makes 4.5% interest savings look like 200% ""instantaneous"" savings, which, of course, is crazy (and incorrect). Thanks for the schooling!

------------------------------------

Hello r/investing,

I did a little digging and found these two posts about paying off mortgages early instead of investing: [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h8t37/pay_more_towards_mortgage_vs_investing/), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2bvcch/what_does_rinvesting_think_of_paying_off_your/).

At first, the advice makes sense:

&gt; Do you believe that over the next 30 years that the annualized return of the stock market will be greater than [4.5]%? 

&gt; If your house was paid off, would you borrow 40k of equity out of it at [4.5]% to invest?

**The highest upvoted advice seems to be: If you have a mortgage at 4.5% interest rate, it's better to invest if you think you'll have a 4.5% or more ROI.**

Now, I realize that mortgages can be structured differently and come with all sorts of fine print, so let me tell you the specifics of my mortgage:

- 360 month (30 year)  $150K mortgage at 4.5% fixed interest 

- 3% down payment (first-time home buyer program)

- No pre-payment penalty

- It's a condo that's worth about $200K; more than the mortgage, less than the mortgage + all interest

- The condo makes great rent (&gt; 1.33% of the mortgage per month before taxes)

- If you need other details, I'd be happy to oblige

The thing people don't realize about [at least some] mortgages is that even though the interest is low (4.5%!), the interest payments are front-loaded. Here is an approximation of my amortization for my first 10 payments (I'm excluding escrow to keep things simple):

Principal ($)|Interest ($)|Total ($)
:-:|:-:|:-:
230|520|750
232|518|750
234|516|750
236|514|750
238|512|750
240|510|750
242|508|750
244|506|750
246|504|750
248|502|750

*Based on how I understand mortgages*, it becomes immediately obvious that, in the beginning of my mortgage, for every ~$250 I pay ahead, I save ~$500 in interest; any forward payment I make goes directly toward principal and the interest is eliminated on that payment of the loan. **If true, this is basically a 200% ROI, correct?**

To be clear, let's say I have $250 extra to invest this month (that is, I already made my minimum mortgage payment). If I spend it on my mortgage, I'm guaranteed to save myself $500 in interest. If I instead invest it, I pay the $500 in interest on my mortgage, so I must make more than $500 on that $250 to make it worth it, no?

So, r/investing, why would I invest in the market instead of paying off my mortgage, at least to a point where I'm *actually* being charged less money per payment than I feel I could make in the market? That is, when my mortgage payments are roughly 90% principal?

Thanks in advance!

---------------------------

**edit:** I agree there's an error in my logic somewhere. I'm starting to understand that the ~$500 saved is over the 30 years, not immediately. That's still a 200% ROI that I *can* net over 30 years, or sooner if I choose to do so... no?

**edit 2:** I think /u/whodun answered my question:

- I would be saving 4.5% over 30 years on the $250, which works out to the ~$500 saved. The 200% would be if I saw all of those savings instantly, but I don't; I see 4.5% savings compound over the life of the mortgage.

- The math isn't 1:1 between stocks and real estate, because interest on real estate can be tax write-offs while profits from stocks are taxed 15% (this is good to know for future investments!)

- The amortization table shows the interest paid per payment of principal over the course of the life of the loan; that's why the interest is going down month by month. I did not understand that when making this post.

- By paying my mortgage early, I save the interest (4.5%), compounded for the life of the mortgage. Paying extra *early* is still better, but not the crazy return I was calculating; it's just more time to compound.

**So, ultimately, the posts I linked to are correct once you adjust for pre-tax vs. post-tax dollars; if your stock portfolio will return more than the interest on your mortgage costs you over the same period of time, it is the better investment.**

Thanks everyone.",26

15-06-23,3aryws,Is VTSMX right for me,"21 year old recent college grad, due to a death in the family I inherited a large sum of money one year ago which has been placed in a trust which funds all of my expenses (medical school, first house in the future, etc). I have barely touched this money besides about 10k in living expenses. In addition I have my own money saved up from employment I have done and am continuing (about 15k).

 Due to my young-ish age and the fact that I will not need the money for quite a while, I believe that based on my research VTSMX is the right place to place my extra cash that I have in my  personal, non-trust account (appx 5k). This would be an invest and hands off for 10-20+ years kind of situation and I would probably add more to it as time goes on.

As for the principal amount of money in my trust, the total comes to 1.7MM. 350k ish is in a roth that rolled down to me so retirement isn't my big concern right now. Beyond that my family has done a lot to convince me to keep it in very low interest T-bills and other ""guaranteed"" securities for the last year to allow me to relax, not worry about money and worry about dealing with the grief which I appreciate. If this investment I make with my personal money is successful I may be able to feel more comfortable moving some of that larger amount of money into something a bit more risky, although very little, if any would end up in VTSMX.

Any advice on what to do with my personal money or my trust account would be appreciated

Been doing it for over a year now and made a good chunk of change.

I leave an open limit purchase for 50,000 shares 0.015 and 0.02 at all times and just wait for them to rise, selling at 0.03 or sometimes as high as 0.035 or 0.04.

I'll usually just skim the value of my earnings off the top of my position and put them back into the account as cash. I've repeated this process to the point where I've actually ended up amassing a pretty substantial position in the company with an aggregate average share price of about 0.02 for my purchase. 

I analyzed the financials as a project for an accounting project in university about a year ago and they weren't stellar, I think they may have been worse this year, but the company is technically fairly young, and in an emerging segment of the market (retirement residences), I'm familiar with their operations, the Canadian market, and I know the small markets they have holdings in very well, and I believe they have the ability to be quite successful.

15-06-24,3aynh9,"Seeking thoughts on my current strategy - 25 years old, looking to buy a house in the next 3-5 years. (x-post /r/personalfinance)","25 years old, living in New Jersey, working in New York City, currently making $60,000/year with some small income coming from an Etsy store ($100-$200/month).


I have no debts, pay off my 2 credit card bills every single month, have about $18,000 in cash assets, and contribute 15% of my salary to a Roth 401(k). 


Here is what I've just done to prepare for a house purchase in 3-5 years:

1. Keep $10,000 as my 6-month emergency fund in my Schwab Checking Account.

2. Contributed $5,500 to a Schwab Roth IRA since I can take $10,000 of any gains out for the first-time home purchase. I invested it in SCHO, which aims to track the 1-3 US Treasury Index. I plan to make that same investment once a year.

3. Contributed $1,500 to my Schwab Brokerage account and also invested it in SCHO. I plan to make this same investment once a month, which should just about account for the remainder of income after my monthly budget.


Not sure if this information is helpful, but I am currently renting an apartment in NJ and also am leasing my car for another 2.5 years.


My thinking is that I will treat the IRA + Brokerage accounts as my house fund. If I need a new laptop or plan to go on vacation or have any other big purchases pop up, then I can just opt to not contribute the $1,500 to the house fund for a month.


So my questions for /r/investing would be: How does this all look? Is SCHO a good option? What am I missing or what should I be doing different?



Edit: $1500/month is actually $1000 into brokerage monthly, and then the extra $500 goes toward the annual contribution to the Roth IRA.",12

I have some experience with investing. I inherited money from a relative in 2008 when I was only 18. They were mutual funds that went up and down. A couple years later, I bought a house at 205k (which was basically the entire mutual fund). I've rented it out for the past years, and I'm now going to net about 250k on the sale.

I happen to have an academic/professional interest in finance too. I'm a physics/computer science major, but I have my eye on quantitative finance as one option in my future. Obviously, I don't have quant skills to use right now.

What do you recommend me doing? I've considered smaller real estate investments, startup businesses, franchise businesses, and obviously stocks/bonds/funds.

Maybe something like:

30% into real estate (a small condo to live in?)

50% into diversified funds managed by someone else

10% cash savings account

10% play money to flex my quant and other trading skills as I develop them over the next few years

This is just a very raw template. Maybe real estate is a bad investment for that small of a size. Maybe that 30% should go into a Subway franchise, or maybe I should fund some short term private money loans? Maybe I should have more play money to flex, or maybe I shouldn't have any at all for several years? 

Other bits of info:

- My mom was an elite stock broker at Merryll Lynch back in the 90s. She's not around anymore, but at least it's in my blood. Would it be worth it to seek contacts?
- I got my real estate license when I was 20. Haven't used it much, but I could always go back and activate it if an investment strategy would be assisted by it.
- Currently in school full time and working programming gigs on the side. Not quite enough income to live on, but it's better than burger flipping. I do have the option of getting a decent full time developing position, and that would be enough to live on and more.
- I'm at community college, so tuition is next to nill. (Books are free because thepiratebay). I'll transfer to a 4-year and pay 40-70k for two years (not sure where I'll go). I will most likely pursue a doctorate afterwards, so that is a further cost which is less certain.",5

Long time lurker here, and I just wanted to say thanks for all the great advice I've received on this subreddit. I have an investment question that I wanted to ask you guys, as I was wondering if this was a good deal.

My father has a friend that cashes checks for workers in our area. He basically came up to my dad with the following deal:

My dad would give him a $10K loan, and he would pay 5% every month in perpetuity (so $500/mo). As this is a loan, I would just need to give him a few months heads up if I wanted the money back. My dad went ahead and did this deal with him and I have been collecting the money. He has been paying on time, never missed a month's payment, contacts me if he needs a few days extra, etc... 

Now my question is -- is this a good deal? Over the course of a year it's a 60% return. I am starting my job soon and if this is financially sound, I wanted to invest another $10K with him. Please let me know what you guys think!",4

15-06-23,3av0jr,Allow Me To Clear A Few Things Up,"Since this subreddit is super slow right now, I thought I would address a few annoying things consistently brought up about the character that is ""badbaseball"". **THIS IS THE LAST TIME I BRING IT UP.**

I haven't actually made a post about this in forever, so let me just address a few things that are brought up about me all the time. I will just refer anyone back to this post.

1. ""I only short"" - Wrong, I actually look and trade long just as much as I short. I just don't talk about it as much because the stuff I long is usually longterm breakouts and isn't interesting.

2. ""I hate pennystocks"" - I love pennystocks. What I don't like is sub-pennystocks because at that point it is pretty much pure gambling in my eyes. I prefer to trade pennystocks that actually do something vs illiquid cheap garbage.

3. ""I got another trader shadowbanned"" - I contacted the head admins about 2-3 months ago that my account was getting attacked by a person spamming downvotes. They ended up banning /u/bu472 and /u/greenbartrading as a result for vote manipulation and mass downvoting. Most people just assume what happened was that I purposely wanted him banned and contacted the admins saying he was doing something. My counter is always ""if he didn't do anything wrong then he wouldn't have been banned""? I use myself as an example, I know he has reported me to the head admins but I am never breaking any rules, therefor I don't get banned.

4. ""If you hate sub-pennystocks then why are you here"" - I enjoy talking about real pennystocks and not the garbage that is almost always brought up (Mjmj, ecig, thcz, etc). I cannot find another subreddit that doesn't dismiss pennystocks entirely.

5. ""Why don't you just post a ticker and talk about it then"" - already done that, usually results in an instant downvote because for some reason people don't like talking about real movers (Gene, pbib, ptbi, pbmd, adxs, etc) on this subreddit.

6. ""Why do you hate investing in otc"" - Because 99.999999% of otc stocks are garbage and the ones I see people investing (on this subreddit) in fall into the 99%. This is an ""opinion"".

7. ""Why aren't you banned yet"" - I actually have gotten shadowbanned in the past.... twice. The thing is I am not actually doing anything wrong. The most recent thing was I was posting on /r/stocks on another account to avoid the ban because I was given permission to. That resulted in a short period where my account was shadowbanned. I contacted the head admins and they saw nothing wrong with it and removed the shadowban (obviously telling me not to post on /r/stocks again).

8. ""You copy what other traders say"" - I don't even understand what this even means. I take the same terms sure, but not directly copy anything. My style of trading is literally a mixture of 10 daytraders that I follow, making it pretty unique.

9. ""You're a beginner giving stock tips"" - I can't prove anything and neither could you, so there is no point in even arguing this. This is usually a follow up after ""you copy what other traders say"". 

10. ""Why do you hate other traders on these subreddits?"" - Occasionally this gets brought up. I do not hate anyone on any of these trading subreddits, what I actually hate is their style of posting. If you were to post an opinion on a stock and give analysis as to why you think it is undervalued, thats fine. I start to not like it when you talk about the ticker in more than 1 topic or talk about your blog consistently, thats what I don't like. Or when someone posts the most insane post about a stock with no future.

11. ""Stop harassing me!!!!"" - Lol...


Just to clear things up and actually get a post in. This subreddit is going through a cycle of cleaning up old users, new ones should be coming in soon :). Usually posts like these get a ton of backlash toward me, I don't care. Anytime someone makes some dumb comment I will ignore or just refer them back to this post. ",5

**Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR)** was nicely grinding up all day until about midday where it snapped 2.50 very cleanly. Expecting it to start showing weakness at the 3.x area. Would like to see it test,  go over and under and then fade on the day. If the stock breaks 3 with no sign of weakness I will consider getting long on a dip risking on 3 (very unlikely). 

**MeetMe, Inc. (MEET)** choppy all day, really not interested in trading this stock unless it tries to break 2 and fails again. 

**Internet Patents Corporation (PTNT)** just on radar for big potential run, probably will not happen. Wrote down just in case. 

**Real Goods Solar, Inc. (RGSE)** pretty thin stock on the verge of a breakout. On radar just in case it breaks out, might be looking for a solid risk/reward long if the setup comes up. Using level 2 as a guide.

**Vascular Biogenics Ltd. (VBLT)** is a bit thin but might be looking to make a small ramp back up over 7. Looking out for 2 things: A gap up parabolic over 7 and maybe looking for a fader setup on the EOD (depending on how it looks), or failed follow though momentum at 7 with a quick washout.

15-06-24,3az91s,ELI5: how investors benefit from share buybacks,"**How does an investor benefit from a share buyback (repurchase)?** I understand the idea that, IN THEORY, investors can benefit if an industry trades at a fixed multiple, they are more likely to see an appreciation in the price following a repurchasing program.  For example, if 10% of the outstanding shares are repurchased, the price should increase by 11% (1/.9 = 1.11).

However, **how long does it take to realize that theoretical increase in the stock price?** (Are we talking 1 week, 1 month, 1 year?) I'm not even sure how one knows if a future price change is largely due to shares being repurchased or other factors.  For instance, companies typically announce a buyback program for $Y that may be performed over X amount of time. However, the company is not obligated to spend all $Y (or buy at all), for example if economic conditions change. Also, investors don't know when the buybacks occur (which may occur at small chunks at a time) other than the period. 

I've read that statistically companies who perform buybacks (buy more shares than they issue) greatly outperform companies that aren't doing buybacks (issuing more than buying). However, I've seen many companies (e.g., AAPL, QCOM) initiate buybacks when their stock price is particularly low (at least in their eyes). If the stock price is indeed low, the stock would likely appreciate over time on its own (i.e., without buybacks). I would think that companies generally do not do buybacks when near all-time highs in share price. As such, a company whose share price is low in their view has more ""room"" to grow than a company whose share price is high (or at least isn't ""low"") in their eyes. For example, company A's (performing buy back) share price is $55 with a 52-week range of $50-$80, and company B's (no buyback) share price is $75 with a 52-week range of $50-80. If they both rise to $85 (at some future time), company A sees a much larger percentage gain. [I'm obviously cherrypicking my numbers in the example. The example is there only to illustrate that something of a lower price can gain more percentage-wise. Penny stocks are an example.]

It still saddens me that, after the 2008 crash, the interest in these types of accounts just never really recovered at all globally.

15-06-24,3azepm,Advice on where to put cashed-out pension for new retiree,"Situation:
My father-in-law is about to retire.  He has a state pension + social security of about $3000/month.  He is 68 years old.  He also must cash out the portion of the mention that he deposited, which is about $125K.

Advice Needed:
I have opened a Vanguard IRA for him to facilitate this cashed-out pension.  I'm going back and forth on what to do with it.  Here are my ideas, I'm welcome to hear others:

1.  Vanguard Target Retirement 2015 Fund (50/50 split across stocks and bonds)
2. Vanguard Target Retirement 2020 Fund (60/40 split across stocks and bonds)
3.  Some type of ""lazy"" portfolio, like (33/33/33 Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund, Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund)'
4.  An more aggressive portfolio with no bonds, like a Dave Ramsey type profile of (25/25/25/25 Growth, Growth &amp; Income, Mid-Cap and International).

My problem is that I hate bonds.  Knowing that interest rates are going to go up and the bonds are going to go down puts doubt in my mind that I should put any money in bonds.  

Maybe you guys can ELI5?  Why, knowing that bonds are likely to drop in the relative near future, should I put him in bonds knowing his age and general lack of experience in the market.

If I invested all my initial funding into it, I could be up ~400 bucks. Thats in the past, but I think I should be dabbling with cheaper stocks than Disney. Im sure y'all will agree but if I had more money, DIS would be a long term gold mine

So.. should I sell DIS and reinvest? Sell AERI? Hold both and enjoy my stake in the market?",0

15-06-24,3b01ch,Is Zynga (ZNGA) worth a look right now?,"Zynga has been beaten down hard and rightfully so over the span of the last year or two.  However, there seem to be a few glimmers of hope right now and I was curious what people thought of the stock.  I know this stock has a bad reputation, but please hear me out on these points before trashing me =)

* Mark Pincus recently returned as CEO -- he seems very motivated to get the company back on track.  It seems they're returning to their entrepreneurial roots in terms of organizing their teams and deploying resources.
* They recently laid off 18% of their staff -- all from non-core functions and no one from the core gaming development teams.  It seems like they are cutting a lot of non-essential fat from the company.
* Really solid mobile titles being released.  The two noteworthy ones are Empires and Allies (which appears to be doing well when looking at the App Store grossing ranks) and Dawn of Titans.  Dawn of Titans is set to release later this year and also looks really solid from a product and gameplay perspective.
* A pretty healthy balance sheet with $1.1B of cash/marketable securities on hand.  If one of these games yields a solid revenue stream, I imagine some of this cash on hand could be used for stock buybacks.
* Declining short interest.  Short interest in Zynga has cut in half in the last two months.  Source: http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/znga/short-interest

Disclosure: I own some shares in Zynga and while I don't know how they'll fare in the long-term, I think for the short/near-term future this could be an interesting buy.  I'm curious to see what others may think. ",1

15-06-24,3awf1q,Changing the Future of Investing,"A couple of months back, a company calledrPlan got in touch with me. I am usually very skeptical about almost most emails/inquiries that I receive through SavvyScot if I’m honest… from dodgy freelancers who want to write a post in exchange for 100 high quality link backs, to people wanting to buy the blog outright; most authors will have experienced similar requests. I decided to check it out anyway and was pleasantly surprised. The concept behind rPlan is to make investing easier – the company’s aim is to create an online environment that allows investors to make informed decisions.
First Impressions
Upon visiting their homepage, instantly one fact cried out to me:
49% of investors in the UK don’t know how their portfolios performed in the last year
WHAT?! I mean seriously… come on guys. Tracking wealth is one of the basic rules of personal finance. Over the next couple of days, this statistic got me thinking about why this could be.
Did people simply have so much money that they didn’t care?
Did people forget about their investments?
Perhaps they didn’t fully understand what the investment was?
Maybe they found it too difficult to understand how to measure performance?
In reality, I think the reason is a combinations of the second two points. Investment tracking is definitely not easy and my guess is that people would rather forget about it and hope for the best. This simply isn’t good enough!
rPlan aims to change this. rPlan aims to make investing easy and give people easy access to key information. In addition to this, there are a number of financial incentives, including a rebate in commission that they receive and capped charges.
Wow this sounds good right? Almost too good to be true! Behold, I have reviewed the product for you! Furthermore, if they deem it to be the best review out of a small series (from other PF bloggers), I could win an iPhone 5… Given that I am highly competitive individual and frequently perform User Acceptance Testing in my career, I have given this some serious research and thought. That said, this review is totally impartial and my honest opinion. To those of you who think this is a boring review and might stop reading… I urge you to continue. There are some great features that I want to discuss!
I’ll start by talking about the overall structure of the site. The site is split into four main areas: Analyze, Invest, Plan and Share.  The rPlan website and portal interface has an overall simplistic and minimalistic feel to it – definitely a good start when it comes to investing! While the site is divided into the four distinct areas, the review will focus mainly on the Analytics side – essentially the most important area for an investor.
Analyse
Overview
Being able to easily track and analyse your portfolio is key to maintaining it’s health. If you are a visual person like myself, the screenshot below gives you an overview of how the portal looks and feels. There are three main summary boxes:
 Dashboard
Cost – This figure represents the total cost that your portfolio carries (usually through Investment fund fees) annually. This is a very important figure and I would highly recommend the team include a feature that calculates the actual cost of your portfolio, instead of just the percentage. This would further simplify making investment decisions. The question marks that you can make out below (next to ‘cost’) expand to give an explanation of the term and an additional link to further explanation.
Risk – This currently represents the overall risk of your portfolio on a scale of 1 to 6. I love this feature, however think that a simple modification would make a greater impact – changing the colour of the number as the risk gets higher. For example a low risk level (1) could be Green, a medium risk yellow and a high risk dark red. This would highlight the associated risk better – which is essentially the most important factor of investment. Perhaps a scale of 1-10 would also be easier to understand.
Performance 12 Months – This statistic shows the average performance of your portfolio over the last 12 months. While I think this is a useful feature, I would prefer it to show the percentage gain/loss since initial investment. I feel that this would be a more relevant figure, given that 12 months might not mean much for new investments.
A minor detail, but I think the descriptions could be made bigger. I would also like to see a change in style of the relevant heading you are currently viewing in the text in the top right hand side of the page. For example, I am currently in ‘Analyse’ so would like to see it a different colour / bold / highlighted in some way. This will help overall navigation and understanding of the portal hierarchy / structure.
Charts &amp; Graphs
This is where rPlan get’s interesting. As I just mentioned, I am a very visual person and would much rather look at a chart / diagram / picture than read a paragraph of text. The Charts &amp; Graphs section shows 4 main charts: Past Performance, Allocation, Risk, Geography. These charts are simple, yet highly effective.
Past Performance – This shows the past success of your investment over a variable time scale. (3m, 6m, 1y, 2y, 3y, 5y) I think rPlan have done really well to keep this simple, yet give enough variety of presets for changing the time period. Some other finance analytical websites have very complicated sliders and check boxes to change the timescale (which often doesn’t work well).
Allocation – This pie chart shows assets by type and category. The labels clearly indicate which countries I have investments in and also the asset type (equity, fixed income etc.) Simple, yet effective
 
Risk – As before, this shows the calculated level of risk of the portfolio. I feel this chart could be developed further to show dimensional risk – i.e. where the different levels of risk actually come from and to show the overall combined risk.
  Geography - This is quite probably my favourite overall feature of rPlan. A simple world map shows the percentage of your portfolio that is invested in each country. By hovering over a country, the percentage is shown – as demonstrated below with Thailand. I think this feature is absolutely fantastic and a great way to track how investments fund managers change their strategies! I feel this could be further improved by using a better colour scale and to label countries with high proportions of your overall investment.
 
In summary, the analytics are fantastically simple, yet clear and detailed. The data could easily be extracted into a mobile app to enable you to check performance on the move. Great work guys!
Share
I love this section of the website. Essentially the sharing section is a forum – a platform to discuss investing options and strategies between members. Obviously as I review the product, the forum is very much in BETA testing mode so it is hard to comment on specifics. Furthermore, there is the option to create private groups and restrict access to your boards. Hopefully the team behind rplan have measures in place to monitor insider / illegal trading.
Given that you have to sign up to invest to access the forum, it should prevent trolls / spamming. I am excited to see how the various threads develop.
 Screenshot from the Forum
Any Advice… anyone???
 
Closing thoughts
Overall, I love how rPlan has made it easy to obtain a high-level overview of your portfolio – a snapshot of performance. For those of us who are a little obsessed with investments and like to track them multiple times per day (I know I’m not the only one) – this is a very nifty feature! The portal is clean and friendly. Unlike a lot of other financial tools, it is not cluttered and full of uninteresting information. The virtual portfolio provides an excellent way to ‘practice’ investing before you take the plunge. rPlan has a wealth of experience in the start-up team and I am excited to see what the future holds. Good job guys!

15-06-24,3awj2j,Guidance for 29 year old military male,"Hey there,

I'm fairly new to Reddit, so if I go against any unwritten (or written) rules, please forgive me.

Currently, I am serving in the Air Force and have three years remaining in my contract. My plan, as of now, is to *not* reenlist at the end of my contract. It is my goal to set myself up to be better equipped in the civilian world. 

Below, I have put a summary of my current assets, expenses, and income. Please note that I do not have housing expenses, as my BAH♪ covers that. (I do not receive BAH, but am required to stay in the dorms (not fun)) Also, for food, I am supplemented BAS♫, which is automatically taken out of my account, so I never see that money. (this is not something I can change)
    
**Assets**

Roth IRA – $3200

Investment Account – $14000

* General Mills - 107 shares
* Intel - 51 shares
* Kinder Morgan - 104 shares
* Energy Transfer Partners (LLP) - 35 shares

Savings Account – $3000

Checking Account – $2000

**Expenses**

Car Payment – $350 (currently paying 500/month – 0% interest(fixed) - remaining balance - $19,000)

Cell Bill – $75/month

Insurance – $90/month

Fuel – $80/month (approximate)

Fun – $200/month (approximate)

**Income**

Base pay – $1400/month (paid bi-monthly)

Other investments – $170/month

*  separate non-traditional loan - principle amount remaining on loan balance - $4700 (should pay for approximately 3 more years, monthly, at current interest rates)


Ideally, I would like to have my vehicle mostly paid off by the time I am out of the military. At the current rate, I will owe around $1000 at the end of my contract, given that I keep my monthly payment where it is.

However, I would really like to put myself in a better financial situation. This way, when I'm merrily skipping my way back to the civilian life, I am more secure and comfortable. For the record, I am *not* married and do *not* have kids, nor am I planning on changing either of those things anytime soon. 

I have owned two (very) small businesses before and have an entrepreneurial spirit. I am skilled at public speaking and a very adapt people person. One thing that heavily interests me is investing into real estate, though at my current income level, I'm not sure how I'd break into that. Neither am I sure that real estate is the way to go. My preference towards that really just exists on the idea of a tangible asset that provides a 'need'.

What advice would you give to someone in my position? 

Thank you very much in advance, for taking the time to read and respond, if you do. It's greatly appreciated!

We are initiating a Phase 2 clinical trial of sotagliflozin in a younger adult type 1 diabetes population in collaboration with JDRF. We are also initiating Phase 3 development of sotagliflozin in type 1 diabetes. We do not intend to continue development of sotagliflozin in type 2 diabetes unless we enter into a collaboration partnership.""


This carcinoid tumor sympton drug was granted fast-track by the FDA and orphan status by both FDA and EMA. The american cancer society estimates that there are about 100,000 carcinoid tumor patients in the US alone, 5-10% of which exhibit carcinoid tumor symptoms that could benefit from this drug.

(Yahoo Finance page)(http://finance.yahoo.com/q;_ylt=AsDoaXPbXP07bVyMUVowypt.FJF4;_ylc=X1MDMjE0MjQ3ODk0OARfcgMyBGZyA3VoM19maW5hbmNlX3dlYl9ncwRmcjIDc2EtZ3AEZ3ByaWQDBG5fZ3BzAzEEb3JpZ2luA2ZpbmFuY2UueWFob28uY29tBHBvcwMxBHBxc3RyAwRxdWVyeQNMWFJYLARzYWMDMQRzYW8DMQ--?p=http%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fq%3Fs%3DLXRX%26ql%3D0&amp;uhb=uhb2&amp;fr=uh3_finance_vert_gs&amp;s=LXRX)
This shows market cap of $825 million, $315 million in cash and $110 million in debt. and 96% institutional ownership. 

In October 2014 they partnered with Ipsen. Ipsen will commercialize the cancer symptom drug outside the US, Canada and Japan. This Ipsen partnership could yield LXRX $150 million in upfront and milestone payments. LXRX's royalties here are about 30%. LXRX has 106 employees and has job postings to hire 10 more. A 9% increase in headcount must mean they want to grow. These open roles include marketing and sales directors and more interestingly a reimbursement and pricing director. They must be rather confident that at least the cancer symptom drug will hit the market given their partnership with Ipsen and these job postings. Of course the FDA and EMA actions support this hypothesis as well.

They did a 1:7 reverse split recently so be weary of that when you look at the chart. Based on today's closing price of $7.98, this would have them at $1.14 on a pre-split basis. On May 21 2015, an analyst at Wedbush Securities gave LXRX a $17.00 price target, which represents a 113% upside to today's closing price of $7.98 ([link](http://www.markets.co/lexicon-pharmaceuticals-inc-nasdaqlxrx-a-buy-wedbush-2/8735/). In fact, another analyst gave it a price target of $21.00 (you can see this on the yahoo finance page).

Specifically regarding the carcinoid symptom trials: 
""We expect to complete enrollment of our pivotal Phase 3 trial of telotristat etiprate in patients with carcinoid syndrome in March 2015. We expect to announce top-line results from the pivotal Phase 3 trial in the third quarter of 2015. Pending the outcome of those results, it is our intent to rapidly move to commercialization by filing an NDA in the first quarter of 2016"".

Specifically regarding the diabetes drug for type 1 patients:
""We expect to commence enrollment of our Phase 3 trials of sotagliflozin in patients with type 1 diabetes in the first half of 2015. We expect to announce top-line results from our Phase 2 trial of sotagliflozin in young adult patients with type 1 diabetes in collaboration with JDRF in the first quarter of 2016"".

15-06-25,3b0ode,IB is incorrectly triggering Adjusted Trigger Orders - and generally have sloppy accounting. Anyone else having problems?,"Go back to 6/1/2015; UPRO had a 2:1 stock split, and my 401 shares turned overnight into... 801 shares. I called in to tech support, and the asshole on the telephone actually said, ""Well, it's just one share..."" I had to push him to investigate and restore the missing share. 

Now, I'm having problems with a fairly complex order that clearly their tech support people just don't understand. [Here's the webpage explaining an Adjustable Order](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/tws/usersguidebook/specializedorderentry/adjustable_orders.htm). Basically, it ties two orders together. The primary is a standard stop-limit, NBD. However, if the market moves in the *other direction* (in this case towards profit and away from market crash!), the primary order is thrown away and a new, opposing order is set up (to capture profits, in this case). Best of both worlds: defense against catastrophe, but prepared to jump when the winds move in your favor.

I was doing something very similar to the example given. My primary order was a stop-limit (well below market, so it never entered the picture at all). I added an Adjustable Trailing Limit order that would trigger if the stock price rose. In other words, I had the Stop Limit to protect me if the market crashed, and the Trigger set slightly higher than market to capture profits when the market rose. I make my money on those Adjusted Trailing Stops. I've done this before.

My Adjustable Trigger was at 72.90; UPRO was below 72.50 at the time; it triggered immediately upon activation; and according to that webpage it should only trigger when the prices *rises above* the trigger (which it didn't). The jerk at Tech Support insists it will trigger on SELLS when it goes below the trigger value, which makes no sense - why would you attach a lower stop order to an existing stop order? They're redundant.

I also called in for tech support while the market was still open. That person was at least polite, if not able to understand what's going on. I set up two identical trades (in two accounts) while on the phone, with attached, adjustable triggers. Absolutely identical. One triggered; the other did not - and the market swept past the trigger and kept going, so we aren't talking about missing a single trade. One of those identical orders ignored literally thousands of valid orders that *should have triggered it.*

Clearly, IB has some screwy problems with their advanced orders software.

And I'm so fucking frustrated with these assholes in Tech Support. ""Oh, it's only one share, dude!"" ""I can't be bothered to read a webpage; I just know you're wrong.""

So, my questions:

1. Anyone else having problems with sticky adding-machine keys at Interactive Brokers? If you're an IB customer, you might want to double-check any stock-splits for accuracy...

2. Anyone else seeing irregularities with the Adjustable Triggers?

3. Anyone know how to get past the jerkoff tech support dweebs and get someone to actually investigate why $3,000 of my money was spent this morning, without my permission? &gt;:(=(",1

15-06-25,3b0uk6,"Starting Out, Input appreciated.","Hey Lads, 
Looking to get started in some basic trading. I've been interested in it for a while and looking to get some real world experience whilst at uni that will hopefully help me land a job trading once I've finished my degree. Have made a total of 1 trade to date (AKBA, it went well, but brokerage stole a large portion of the profit. No more US stock for me haha). 

Currently studying a commerce degree, finishing second year exams now. Majoring in both Accounting and Finance. In the past I have entered share trading simulation competitions and done reasonably well.

The current plan is. Initially invest: $3600 AUD. Use e-trade pro(for the extra excel graphing compatibility) and make a total of ten trades a month in the ASX to nullify the extra cost of that. However leaving brokerage at a total of $200 a month. Which is equal to 5.56% of the capital, effectively the first 6% a month is gone. So I'd like to try and keep it at that minimum, by not putting in any complex orders avoiding adding cost by just keeping a close eye on the share's I'm invested in and sticking to the plan(10% loss out, don't bail on the winning trend early). Any idea's around the brokerage? 

With the brokerage fee's taken into account, is it still possible/likely to retain a decent profit with smart investing? In theory it is, but with this small amount of capital, I may be in dreamland.

Hopefully if in the next few months I can manage to make a positive return after brokerage, I'll significantly increase capital invested and instead of trying to get another accounting internship(I've already done a couple, chances of getting an investment banking internship are low) in early december I'll dedicate myself to trading 10+ hours a day trying to profit on the share market and document it somehow that shows exactly why I made each trade and the end result, so I can include it on my resume when going for an IB internship or job later down the track.

The type of trading I'd be looking to do is swing trading. 

The reason for $3600, is it will potentially allow me to put in $800ish in 4 stocks at anyone time and allow a reasonable lee way to increase the investment in a share If I'm more confident in my research with it.
 
The $3600, I'm using more as a learning experience and am happy to risk it initially. The rest, I will not be willing to put in unless I can prove that I'm competent at least.

Is this a possibility for working out? Or am I in dreamland? 

Any input/advice is much appreciated. ",2

I know that stock splits doesn't affect the underlying company's intrinsic value nor the market cap in any way. However, I've always read that stock splits can be positive for a company, because it makes the stock more accessible to investors with less capital. The USAToday article had an interesting perspective, claiming that the stock split would attract investors of less quality. The author seems to think when NFLX is more accessible after the split, it will become more volatile as a result of more trading.

15-06-26,3b66o5,"Affordable logistics solutions, the future is now | iContainers","
More than 60 people attended the seminar about **how to import goods succesfully into the U.S this week in Miami**. Banco Sabadell held the event, where the discussion aimed at helping businesses leverage supply chain resources in South Florida to [import goods from Spain to the United States!](http://www.icontainers.com/us/ocean-freight/united-states-spain/door-to-door/). And the message is clear: affordable logistics solutions are already here to make it easier. Once more, the potential of Miami as a trade epicenter for the whole American continent was highlighted.

Guests from diverse companies like Carmen and Lola, Ameriworld, Roca, Ecofactor Florida, Club Expats, and institutions like Ivace, Extenda or Confederación Empresarios Gallegos en USA followed the event. For the first time in Miami, a big review of the importing process was the focus.

The seminar provided a panoramic look at the logistic process and all the requirements needed to import goods into the U.S. iContainers offered tips about the various steps in the process; Inmaculada Gutierrez, representative of the Spanish Trade Commission, encouraged seminar attendees to reinforce the Spanish investment in the American market; and Mario Velo, from Banco Sabadell, provided financial information about how to do it.

The members of the roundtable wanted to share their experiences along these years in the U.S: Pedro González from Encofrados Alsina, Sergio Davo from Zumex and Baubak Askari from Vintae/Askari OH. The Q&amp;A revealed the increasing interest of the companies about the changes at major ports, like the new Canal de Panamá or the upcoming business oportunities with Cuba.

The audience was interested in iContainers‘ online price aggregation technology. This new system simplifies the reservation process of overseas shipping while eliminating hidden charges and bringing transparency to the shipping industry. The iContainers software platform operates much like Expedia, Kayak and Skyscanner, travel sites that aggregate airline fares, hotel prices, and vacation getaways. [iContainers!](http://www.icontainers.com) does the same for shippers, giving customers the ability to peruse shipping companies and prices.

Industry watchers say these freight forwarders will make shipping less expensive because their margins are lower. Shipping lines will start dropping prices to better compete for customers. Businesses that shied away from importing and exporting will likely enter the market. And in the end, consumers might just see the price of goods – even luxury items – dropping. Online travel sites have changed how we travel, now it’s turn to see how online freight forwarders will change the way we do business internationally and how we shop.",1

&gt;stock prices are determined through the demand value


&gt; more shares and high value determines how much say you have in a particular company


&gt;higher stock price means higher demand which mostly means that a company is doing well

&gt;how does stock benefit a company?

80K in 401K (25% bond, 75% in 2050 retirement fund). 50K in cash earning air for interest.

For me, it was interesting to read, since I'm new to investing, and this is the first time I hear about the 4% rule.
  
&gt;The “4% rule” is a theory that states you should be able to retire and safely withdraw 4% of your savings every year and your money should last 30 years. There are many assumptions with this – a 3% historical inflation rate, 7% stock return, 4% bond return, and a 50% stock/50% bond allocation.

I truly want to buy into this company as I believe in what they're doing.  In fact, when the ~$30k model comes out I will be buying it (as long as it looks quality).  I also think most people here who own the stock will buy a TSLA car for the same reasons that I will buy.  TSLA seems similar to Aapl to me - they have customers and then they have fans who are customers.  IMO the fans will allow the company to exceed sales estimates for many years.  Just my opinion.

I'm just nervous about buying and then having it drop - I may have waited too long to get into the game.  Although, if I'm banking on TSLA for long term success, buying monthly will allow me to buy if it's high or low.

**What happened?**

The stock dropped close to 19% on the news to make its loss so far this year 44%.

**What does MU do?**

MU produces and sells DRAM modules mainly for PCs.  DRAM is simply your RAM component.  This revenue source makes up about 61% of total revenue, and as of late revenues have declined due to slower than expected PC demand as well as new competition – mainly Samsung.    Mobile DRAM usage is on the upswing however and might start taking up more of the revenue stream here.  The concern is Samsung as a competitor will start to take up MU's market share – but along the way it will drive down its own margins so the extent of this claim may be over-exaggerated.  

The other revenue source comes from the broad NAND category.  NAND is your flash drive storage modules.  They sell NAND under the Lexor name brand in the form of USB drives and SD drives.  These drives are also used inside of mobile devices for storage.

**Value**

Micron has about $12 bn in Net tangible assets – or about $9bn in unearned valuation (off of its $21bn valuation).

With earnings coming in at $3bn for fiscal year 2014, and with 2015 fiscal year earnings projected to be slightly up at 3.1 bn – it would take just 3 years to reach a price to net assets of 1.  

This represents substantial value even if earnings were to drop by half following FY2015, as it would just take 4 additional years to realize P/NTA of 1.  That being said, analysts don't predict earnings to drop, rather as MU's partnership with Intel picks up in 2016, analysts expect EPS top reach $3.5 per share.  

&gt;&gt;Durcan: ""We will build 3D NAND for them through an agreement out of Singapore ... That's probably all I can say, absent an agreement with Intel to share more information with you."" 

I think Micron is a buy at a market cap under $25bn.  (24.80 per share)",5

I have ISOs, RSUs, and soon ESPP shares coming (all of the same company). I have exercised and held my ISOs in the past and they are now long-term capital gains shares. My RSUs will vest starting Jan 1, 2016 and by that point I will have participated in my company's ESPP program for two purchase cycles.
My broker has a default behavior of FIFO for the account these shares are automatically deposited to (though I can specify tax-lots and such at point of sale). I had planned to use the ESPP program as sort of a ""rolling 6-mo savings account with at least 15% interest"" and immediately sell on exercise and dump the balance into my student loans.

Now onto the questions I haven't found a clear answer to on the internet:

1) My basic math sense tells me I could sell the equivalent amount of shares my ESPP deposits into my account out of the long-term tax-lot (coincidentally FIFO) and avoid paying short-term gains on the same amount of money. Going forward I could also ""revolving door"" the newer shares in and sell the older shares for long-term gains. This seems ideal. The only way I can see cherry-picking tax-lots being better to sell would be if I had losses I wanted to harvest. I guess the important thing here is all the stock is in the same company, that fact changes the approach I would think.

2) I also planned on selling my RSUs as they vested (first 1/4 come Jan 1, 2016), they will ""sell-to-cover"" on vesting. Will they actually sell my long-term shares instead of approx. 1/3 of my RSUs due to FIFO? Does it prioritize selling 1/3 of the incoming RSU tax-lot instead? How does that work?

Anyone have some advice? I realize cycling old shares out for newer shares raises my cost-basis consistently.",0

I'm a college student starting senior year at a state college studying Accounting and Finance. I have an EFC of $0 because I am considered independent due to my military status in the Air National Guard. As such I will qualify for grants on top of my military aid and scholarships which means that my tuition and books will be paid for.  At the same time **I will be eligible to take out a subsidized loan of $5,500 max. If I have read everything correctly the loan accrues no interest until 6 months after I graduate. There is a 1.05% loan fee. After the grace period the interest rate is like 4.5% or something.**  
I also am currently in a summer internship with a US agency that has a relatively high likelihood of a job offer when I graduate. If I were to enter into a job with them after I graduate I would be eligible for their student loan repayment program after 6 months of working there and they repay up to 10K if I sign a 3 year contract. Their entry level salary is around 60K pre tax. I have about 20K split up between a personal investing account (18K) and a TSP/RothTSP (2K).

EDIT: Current Pros 

* The way I look at it that $5,500 loan will be the cheapest rate I'll ever get. I can invest it in the market and make a nice chunk of change
* If I choose to go to that job I can uses their SLRP to pay the loan and I get a free bonus
* Taking then paying off that loan (might?) boost my credit score?  

Current Cons 

* I don't like debt
* If I invest and the market tanks I could loose money and still end up owing
* A year and a half is a relatively short investment horizon
* I may not go with the agency job if I find something else I like taking the SLRP program out of the picture
* SLRP program at agency could get cut out of their budget (not too likely)

15-06-27,3bc524,I wrote some simple code to see if I can identify support/resistance patterns from candlestick data. Here are the results.,"[**ALBUM**](http://imgur.com/a/7WmAS)

I said a few days ago [I was working to see if I can get a computer program to identify support and resistance patterns](http://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/3abh1d/stock_traders_any_advice_on_finding_sell_points/csb4rhx), and I came up with a little program that tries to do so. This relies on daily candlestick data so I had to keep it pretty simple. I add a point if the high, low, or close finishes within 0.1 of a level, with potentially another point, depending on how close it finishes to that level. I take a half-point away if the price easily crosses over a level (crosses by more than 0.1). Essentially the program tries to pick out the ""stickiest"" numbers. Obviously, a stock will move a greater amount in raw terms if its price is in the 100s than if its price is more like 50, so I allowed the threshold to be a bit flexible. But really, in my mind the definition of finishing close to a level is finishing within -0.10 and +0.10 of it for most stocks.

For being as crude as it is, I'm reasonably satisfied with the results. AAPL's levels are obvious enough that even a simple piece of code can see them. GS's recent move makes it hard to find anything more about it other than it was stuck on 190 for some time. VZ has stayed in that 45-50 range for so long, it's hard to get a good picture of it, other than I guess the 50 level. If there is some stock you're absolutely convinced is range-bound between a resistance/support pattern, you can let me know and I'll see if the code gibes with your observations.

Here's the code in matlab:

function output = stocks(input,threshold,extra)

%Default threshold = 0.1, extra = 1

levels = min(min(round(input))):max(max(round(input)));

output = zeros(size(levels));

for j = 1:length(levels)

    for i = 1:length(input)

        open = input(i,1) - levels(j); high = input(i,2) - levels(j); low = input(i,3) - levels(j); close = input(i,4) - levels(j);

        if abs(close) &lt;= threshold; output(j) = output(j)+extra+10*(threshold-abs(close)); end

        if abs(low) &lt;= threshold; output(j) = output(j)+extra+10*(threshold-abs(low)); end

        if abs(high) &lt;= threshold; output(j) = output(j)+extra+10*(threshold-abs(high)); end

        if (high &gt; threshold &amp;&amp; close &lt; threshold*-1) || (low &lt; threshold*-1 &amp;&amp; close &gt; threshold); output(j) = output(j)-0.5; end

**Cleveland BioLabs, Inc. (CBLI)** is a dangerous low float stock. Ideally it does one of two things tomorrow: Fades back to 5.00 and reverses trend red/green. Ramps back up and maybe fades again. Difficult play, would highly recommend trading with a plan on this one (with a risk/reward). 

**Real Goods Solar, Inc. (RGSE)** nice little breakout buuuuuut it is probably going to pullback after some after market news. I will be looking for any grind back up, otherwise this stock is dead to me.


**Penn Virginia Corporation (PVA)** had a very choppy intraday chart BUT is still very interesting to be based on it's lateday movement (I would probably ignore it if it just faded off). Looking for failed follow through momentum at 5.50. Lateday fade is what I am mainly looking for, WITH A GOOD RISK/REWARD. 

**InterCloud Systems, Inc. (ICLD)** is pretty unique because I am not looking for a parabolic move or a lateday fade. I am just watching in case it goes red then fades, I do not want to try and fight the trend on this stock since it normally fades terribly. 

**Synergy Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (SGYP)** on radar for 8 snap, or 8 short squeeze. Be very careful.


Review
-
&gt;Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR) was nicely grinding up all day until about midday where it snapped 2.50 very cleanly. Expecting it to start showing weakness at the 3.x area. Would like to see it test, go over and under and then fade on the day. If the stock breaks 3 with no sign of weakness I will consider getting long on a dip risking on 3 (very unlikely). 

Yup it touched 3 exactly and immediately pulled back. Unfortunately this stock was super choppy anyway (which is why I didn't put it on my watchlist today).

&gt;MeetMe, Inc. (MEET) choppy all day, really not interested in trading this stock unless it tries to break 2 and fails again. 

This was super dull all day, really unfortunate.

&gt;Internet Patents Corporation (PTNT) just on radar for big potential run, probably will not happen. Wrote down just in case. 

Didn't do anything, pretty much expected that. Wrote it down just in case.

&gt;Real Goods Solar, Inc. (RGSE) pretty thin stock on the verge of a breakout. On radar just in case it breaks out, might be looking for a solid risk/reward long if the setup comes up. Using level 2 as a guide.

This stocks breakout was extremely clean, I didn't get long because I couldn't find a good /r/r :(. I was correct on it though.

&gt;Vascular Biogenics Ltd. (VBLT) is a bit thin but might be looking to make a small ramp back up over 7. Looking out for 2 things: A gap up parabolic over 7 and maybe looking for a fader setup on the EOD (depending on how it looks), or failed follow though momentum at 7 with a quick washout. 

Just barely touched 7 and pulled back .20. Really clean

Individual Stock:  Considered a risky investment because you can technically lose all of your money invested in a particular stock.  Proper timing is important to generate the highest profits.  It’s best to diversify your stocks based on asset classes, geographies, sectors, and market cap.  The price of a stock is based on many factors such as earnings, interest rates, political events, hype, news about the company, and more.  The stock market is too volatile for investors not to diversify their portfolio.  Always have cash on hand for buying opportunities or to repurchase shares at a lower price.  Most investors have a stop-loss order to limit the amount of loss for a particular security.  It can be used for long or short-term trading positions to decrease the amount of emotional trades.

Bonds:  Most portfolios consist of stocks and bonds.  Bonds are purchased for a steady income stream.  The interest payments are fixed twice a year with principal and the longer the term of the bond, the higher the risk.  Bonds are not protected by inflation but are considered less risky than stocks.  They are IOUs from municipal entities, corporations, and U.S. government.  Borrowers with good credit will pay less interest for their bonds.  Bonds should be purchased when there is deflation because it increases the value of dollars paid to bond holders.

CD’s:  CD’s are a certificate of deposit that has a maturity date, interest rate, and issued in any denomination.  The risk is extremely low if it’s backed by FDIC.  For CD’s it’s all about what interest you’re locked into because if interest rates go up you are stuck at the lower rate.  Many that sign up for CD’s do it for a year or less.  There are withdrawal penalties for CD’s if you need to close before the maturity date.  Some investors rollover their CD’s which may end up hurting more because if interest rates go down, the CD will get rolled over to the lower rate.  There are variable rate CD’s offered for people worried about interest rates rising.  CD’s provide a combination of income and safety.  Here are high online CD rates for 1-year:  Bank Rate

Precious Metals:  Most people that invest in precious metals purchase gold, silver, and platinum.  Individuals can purchase the actual metal in stores such as gold and silver coins, or purchase precious metal ETF’s.  The paper investment ETF’s are stocks highly correlated with the current value of precious metals.  You don’t physically own the metal.  Precious metals are risky because of high upward and downward price movements that are based on supply and demand.  Investors purchase metals to shield against the effects of inflation.

Mutual Fund:  Mutual funds are considered less risky than purchasing individual stocks because they are investment programs.  The company collects your money along with many other investors to purchase a group of stocks, bonds, and other securities. Investors don’t need large amounts of money to purchase mutual funds and it’s a good way to diversify your portfolio.  Mutual funds are managed by professionals and are more for people that don’t have time to oversee their own investments.  Mutual funds are considered safe for retirement savings plans.

Collectibles:  Collectibles are items that have value and in demand.  It can range anywhere from art, antiques, beanie babies, coins, classic cars, comic books, sports memorabilia, toys, etc.  You need to know what you’re purchasing because a lot of collectibles are worthless.  Unique items tend to be valuable such as old LEGO blocks, old breakfast cereal, classic NES games, old electronics, vintage magazines, old stamps, etc.  Collectibles are tricky because it’s more about what the buyer is willing to spend and how much demand there is for the limited selection of items.  The price of certain collectibles tend to increase when the dollar weakens. 

P2P Lending:  Is an alternative investment that provides a high return for investors.  People can borrow or lend money that is separate from financial institutions.  Lenders provide money to people they do not know called “peers.”  There is incentive to lend because the rate of return is higher than at traditional financial institutions generally between 5%-9%.  Borrowers seeking loans from P2P sites are doing it because they are lacking the credentials from traditional institutions due to high default risk.  The biggest concern for P2P lending sites are the default risk from borrowers.  There are no claims to any assets on personal loans for lenders.  Reputable P2P sites spread your loan across hundreds of loans to offset default risk.  However, P2P sites are lightly regulated that is still considered unproven.  P2P lending has yet to weather a boom or bust cycle.

15-06-26,3b82qo,How hedge-fund geniuses got beaten by monkeys — again,"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-hedge-fund-geniuses-got-beaten-by-monkeys-again-2015-06-25  

**Excerpts**:  

The average hedge fund has produced a worse investment performance in the first half of this year than a portfolio consisting of a savings account at your local bank and a random collection of stocks picked by a blindfolded monkey.

Stop me if you’ve heard this one before. 

... **Hedge-fund defenders object that it’s not fair to compare funds directly to the stock market, because hedge funds are “managing risk” and so on. You have to compare them to an overall balanced portfolio of stocks, bonds and cash, right?**

OK.

A few years back a study conducted on behalf of the endowment of Cambridge University’s Clare College found that, historically, the best risk-managed simple portfolio for a long-term investor had usually been a balance of 80% stocks and 20% cash (or equivalent, such as Treasury bills), rebalanced once a year.

You can play around with simple portfolios but this will do as well as any. It’s about as simple as you can get.

Someone who put 20% of their money in a federally insured bank savings account, and the other 80% in a random collection of stocks from around the world, picked by monkeys, would be up about 6.2% so far this year. (And that’s assuming for the sake of simplicity that you earned 0% interest on the savings. In reality, you could have done slightly better)

In other words, they would still have earned more than twice the returns of the average hedge fund.

Gosh, the money and effort that goes into those hedge funds really paid off, didn’t it?

15-06-28,3bexxc,Increase of FED interest rates and its impact on treasury bond price,"I am currently constructing a portfolio with a  5-10 years perspective. I want to include treasury bonds. 

After discussion with a friend, he told me the current situation with the incoming rate increase by the FED is not favourable. According to him I should wait before buying bonds. To me it seems that all that information should be included in the bond price already. 

The only point where I agree is that there might be a lot of uncertainty on rates in the near future that might cause a higher variability of the portfolio value.

If someone sells a put, then that buyer turns around and sells the put he purchased... who is obligated to purchase the shares if the option is exercised.

For example... A sells a put contract of XYZ to B.  B then sells the put contract to C.  C exercises the put.  Who has to buy XYZ from C?

From what I understand, A always has the obligation to purchase regardless of who currently owns the right to sell.  Is this correct?

&gt;Bottom line – Greece has given the world many beautiful and important things and its cultural heritage is among high points in the history of humanity. But finance just isn’t its strong suit. Fortunately for the world, we’ve had time to prepare and the Greek economy is about the size of the economy of Atlanta, Georgia. Contagion is a real risk, but probably not the risk it was when this all began. More to the point, contagion is always a risk, not just when the newspapers begin talking about it.=",3
15-06-28,3bf61h,"Monthly Dividends, Car Payments, Leverage Decay, and more!","I've been wanting to get a car for a while and I've had the idea of buying monthly dividend paying stocks/ETFs/ENTs with the money that I would use as a down payment as even in a market crash like 07-08, the value of the underlying assets would more than likely depreciate much less than the car would.  


Ideally even if I don't buy enough shares to get a large enough monthly dividend to completely cover the payment, the dividends would at least subsidize it.


With the interest rate on the potential loan being ~2.5-3%, each $1,000 down would take off roughly $15 from each month's payment.  $1,000 in $HDLV (More on this later) will pay roughly $8.40 per month.  Another higher yielding ETN $MORL would pay roughly $21 per month on average.
[List of funds that I'm finding these from along with info about them](http://etracs.ubs.com/product/list)
By my math it's definitely possible to make/subsidize payments like this.  The only issue is this: Those two ETNs are levered, and looking at the graphs of both they do decay quite a bit despite the fact that they only re-balance once per month AND the market has been doing pretty good lately.


Ideally in a situation like this, if the market were to continue to go up or even sideways and those funds followed, I would do this without hesitation as I really don't see any downside.  Unfortunately looking at the performance of the underlying for those I'm not quite sure if I want to do it.


I'm assuming the decline in both has to do with leverage decay, but the monthly re-balancing seems like it would do just fine in theory, but I guess not.  Could someone explain how leverage decay would effect this moving forward versus the decay of value for any vehicle (Most of which typically lose 50% of their value in the first 3 to 5 years).


So, my question for everyone is what do you think of doing this?  Would you consider doing this, picking different funds/stocks, etc?

15-06-28,3bf6yc,Why do the US Markets seem to care more about potential Greek default than the potential crash of the Chinese stock market?,"Both the Shanghai and Shenzhen Composites have dropped by nearly 20% over the last two weeks. China and its economy are about two orders of magnitude bigger than Greece. It is also far more likely that American investors have direct exposure to China than Greece. China-based companies like Alibaba and Baidu list on American exchanges and people may have invested in China or Hong Kong-based ETFs. I'm not sure anyone's directly tapped into the Greek market outside of the YOLO's over at /wsb. Further, a market crash in China would be a bigger move, going from boom to bust, than any resolution to the Greek issue, which is more like a decision between different levels of fucked.

15-06-28,3bd1fn,Vanguard ETFs vs Mutual funds,"I'm trying to understand what would incentivize someone to buy into a mutual fund instead of just buying shares in an ETF (I use Vanguard as an example because it seems to be the most commonly discussed). An ETF has no minimum buy in, no expense ratio, and if you buy through Vanguard then there's also no commission. And it doesn't seem like the ETFs do much better than the mutual funds.

Also, I'm planning on putting about $5k into a Vanguard ETF, it seems like the most efficient/cheapest way to do this is through the Vanguard site, is that right? And what would a typical bid/ask spread be on their ETFs, or where could I find that info?",4

[story in comments]","Sorry, I felt like the title needed a little backstory. My extraordinarily wealthy uncle passed away a few months back. My mom was his only sister, I'm an only child, and he had no children of his own, so I was endowed with a large sum of the inheritance (close to $1.25 million). About 40% of the funds are untouchable and will be allocated in predetermined amounts over certain periods of time. Around 50% of the funds are stocks that he owned and were transferred to me via his ""transfer-on-death"" request.  Because 50% of my total inheritance consists of his stocks that I intend on holding, I would like to learn and make a few trades of my own with some of the remaining balance.  With 40% locked up and 50% in stocks I never plan on selling, I'm left with 10% (~$120,000).  Some of this money is going toward my rent, tuition, and expenses as a graduate student; however, with my newly acquired portfolio, I figured that I could afford to make some trades of my own, including some YOLO picks.  

Here's my plan: with $120,000 accessible, I've budgeted around $80,000 for some tuition, rent, utilities, and misc expenses to get me through grad school with little to no debt.  That leaves me with roughly $40,000 to learn with.  I've placed ~$25,000 of the $40,000 on some solid companies that I believe to have a decent future ($GILD, $HCA, $APPL, $MBLY, $SBUX, $TSLA, and some others), but I still have ~$15,000 in buying power.  I'm not looking for any guarantees whatsoever, just thought I'd ask for some opinions and see what might come from it.  Additionally, I have some minor experience trading on the OTCX and I'm aware of the numerous variables I'll need to consider when dealing with those stocks, but I'm not afraid to take the risk on those exchanges as well... so let's hear it /r/wallstreetbets what do you have for me? 


TL;DR I've received a large amount of money from my recently deceased uncle. With over 90% of the inheritance already allocated elsewhere, I'm left with roughly $15,000 to throw on some high-risk/high-reward YOLOs. All suggestions welcome ",7
15-06-29,3bgsjb,SERIOUS WALL OF TEXT,"Here’s the deal. 

The idea of present value is the cornerstone of all financial theory and to me is the single most important concept in personal investment management. 

There are four basic inputs to your future value (FV). PV, r, n, and PMT. The last sentence of each paragraph is intentionally satirical to alleviate wall of text pain.

PV – the capital (assets less liabilities) you start with. This value is difficult to change unless you are a publicly-traded technology company priced at 100x revenue with no profit or business plan, in which case the current capital markets environment would be glad to provide you millions of dollars.

n – the amount of periods/years between now and your FV endpoint. If I want to retire when I’m 65 I’ll have 44 periods to put my money to work. This value is difficult but not impossible to increase. Exercising, eating well, and avoiding unnecessary risks (drug and alcohol abuse, speeding, drug and alcohol abuse combined with speeding, etc.) will maximize your positive influence on this value. Genetics and the ever-present idiosyncratic risk of death also influence this value. Ironically being a successful investor allows you to purchase better medical care, thus increasing your n value and making you a more successful investor. Just ask Warren Buffett who unfortunately was born slightly too early to benefit from capital-fueled medical immortality. 

PMT- the amount per period you can pay yourself/invest. This value is arguably the most predictable and influential input to your endpoint FV (depending on the relative values of PMT and r and where they occur in time). Purchase an education, learn skills that the economy you live in values, sell those skills, and then pay yourself first. Recognize that anything you spend money on reduces your ability to maximize this value. Justify every expenditure. Start treating money as a vector quantity ($value, location in time) instead of a scalar quantity. Debt is paying to shift where cash flows occur in your life and should be reserved for financing a house, an education, or a massive purchase of out-of-the-money call options on a thinly-traded OTC microcap healthcare company the day before the PDUFA date of the only drug in its pipeline.

r – your rate of return per period. This is determined by how you deploy your PV and PMT capital, fees, and taxes. The performance of the assets you are exposed to less taxes and fees over a period comprises your r value 
The relationship between PV, r, n, PMT, and FV is crudely estimated below assuming constant PMT growth g (not realistic) and constant r (not realistic).

FV after n periods = PV(1+r)n + PMT1[(1+r)n-(1+g)n/(r-g)] 
In reality you will experience some distribution of r values spread across n periods. Where these r values occur in time has a huge effect on the output FV. Frontloading high positive r values on early periods drastically increases your FV endpoint due to the miracle of compounding returns.

My thinking is that when the split happens Ebay is going to go down and Paypal will go up nicely over time.  The normal process of selling short is easy to understand, but what happens when I'm trying to sell short a stock that comes with another stock?  If I 'borrow' Ebay from RBC right before the split will I still get the free paypal stock?  And if I'm right, and Ebay goes down, am I expected to return the Paypal stock when I replace the Ebay stock?

Or is it the case that because I got the Ebay stock before the split the Paypal stock is mine.  If that't the case then why don't I just sell short on a TON of Ebay, get the free Paypal stocks, then even if Ebay goes UP by $10 I'll still be paying less than the IPO price of $13?",0

15-06-29,3bgvpl,How to Deal With a Large Decline in Stocks,"We are now 6 years into this bull market in U.S. stocks. There have been historical bull markets that lasted even 8-10 years, but these cases are rare. In other words, the current bull market is aging, which increases the probability of a bear market. In addition, it’s been a while since the last large correction (almost 4 years), which increases the possibility of a large correction.

 Large Decline in Stocks

Hi there! Today I am having Tony from InvestingOnTrack.com. Let me know if you would like to submit a guest post.

Although I do not think that the U.S. stock market will enter into a bear market this year, there is a big chance of a large decline. I mentioned my reasons in a post titled Why the U.S. Stock Market is Making a Big Top. The main reasons are as follows:

The U.S. stock market is failing to make decisive new all time highs and volatility in the markets is massive.
The U.S. economy is starting to contract.
Corporate earnings are negative as a whole.
So while you probably don’t want to dump all your stocks because we are still in the midst of a bull market, you probably do want to shift your exposure to protect yourself from the coming decline in equities. Here’s how you can do that.

Switch to large cap stocks that pay high dividends
Large cap stocks are stocks of the big companies like Wal-Mart, AT&amp;T, Exxon Mobil, etc. As a group, large cap stocks are less volatile than small cap stocks, which are smaller companies. For example, large cap stock prices like Walmart fluctuate less than small cap stocks like Lululemon. This makes logical sense. To better understand this idea, think of the analogy of a big ship vs a small ship. Big ships are heavy and clumsy, so they move slowly. On the other hand, small ships are light and fast, so they move quickly.

During large market declines it’s best to invest in large cap stocks whose stock prices fall less. The good news is that a lot of large cap stocks pay hefty dividends. There is a reason for this correlation: large cap stocks tend to be companies that are no longer experiencing strong growth, which means that these companies don’t need to retain most of their earnings for massive expansion. That’s why large cap companies like AT&amp;T pay out larger dividends compared to the average growth company. As long as the company continues to pay high dividends, the dividends will offset some of your capital gains losses during the market crash.

As a side note, you should beware of small cap stocks that pay high dividends. No matter how “large” these dividends are, they will not equal to 20% of the stock price. The capital gains losses will vastly exceed your dividends during a large market drawdown because small cap stock prices rise fast but also tank fast.

Shift to U.S. Dollar denominated holdings
Let’s first clear up a common misconception: gold is not a safety haven. Precious metals crashed just like every other asset during the 2008 financial crisis. The only true safety haven (market that rises in a financial crisis) is the U.S. dollar. Even though some people say that the dollar is going straight to hell because of currency depreciation, it still is relatively safer compared to other currencies like the Euro and the Yen.

A lot of investors own assets that are denominated in foreign currencies. During a big correction, the U.S. dollar soars and other currencies tank. Thus, switching to U.S. denominated holdings will protect the portion of your portfolio that was previously exposed to this foreign exchange risk.

Diversify
I’m not a big believer in diversification when the market is rallying and the going is good. Steve Jobs was a huge believer in focus: you can only achieve greatness if you focus on a few things. By concentrating his portfolio on the hottest tech stocks during the late 1990s, famed trader Dan Zanger (check out his Wikipedia page) turned $10,000 into $18 million. And no, that was not a typo.

15-06-29,3bgwga,Change my view: RMB (Chinese Yuan) is an effectively risk free investment.,"I have over 20% of my portfolio in Chinese Yuan. It's been there for close to 5 years. It is earning 3.25% interest + consistent gains vs the dollar. Total return is a predictable and reliable 6-8%.

This is an effectively risk free investment, in my view. The RMB is way undervalued and China tightly controls it's value in relation to the dollar. They have been allowing it to slowly strengthen for a decade. If they allowed the currency to float freely without notice, that is a 'risk' that would result in me making an instant 20-40% profit. If they decided to make the currency artificially weaker, it would ruin their economy. Betting on China to do what is in their own best interest is an essentially risk-free proposition and it's in their best interest to keep doing what they have been doing. 

Allow me to address some common responses right off the bat to save us some time:

""That's a carry trade"" -- if you say so, but it's an effectively risk free one. If you disagree, please show your work. Saying it's a carry trade does not invalidate my thesis. 

""there are risks with managed currencies"" --ok...please show your work on the risks of this specific managed currency. Saying there are risks with managed currencies does not invalidate my thesis.

""&lt;vague handwave statements about China, their government or their economy&gt;"" ok...please show your work. I read the news too, I also lived in China for awhile. You're almost certainly not telling me anything I don't already know. Vague handwaves do not invalidate my thesis. ",0
15-06-29,3bgzix,Soon to be father looking for advice on setting up an investment gift for incoming baby.,"Wife and I have a baby on the way and I want to set up regular contributions to an investment fund as a gift to my little one when it turns ~18. We were thinking 25-50 dollars a month which will likely factor into how often we can make purchases due to minimum buy ins and trade fees.

My questions are:

    What type of fund would you guys suggest?

    How frequently should the purchases by set for (I want everything automated) and why?

    Do you think it's important to diversify into more than 1 fund?

    How does a timeline of around 2 decades affect the choice of fund.

    How often should I check on the investment and what actions would you suggest taking during these check ups?

Thanks in advance for any time you take to offer your advice!

Quite honestly I have no real idea what this might mean for the precious metals market or gold market as I am not an expert on the subject. But as China has accumulated gold, bought producers and properties, operates world's biggest physical gold exchange (SGE) and now plan to have a say on the gold price, I see how this could turn out to be very bullish for the mining stocks that have been mercilessly beaten over the last few years.

What does people in r/investing think of in terms of how this could play out in the stock market, are derivatives traders being cornered and Comex people soiling themselves? Am I looking at a potential opportunity of a lifetime or just another bust?

15-06-27,3b9zpm,"After A Month, Here Is What I Found....","This month has been really slow for me..... Like extremely slow. I haven't made a trade all month and just watch the same plays go by without touching them. I have been doing this for a variety of reasons such as: analyzing the most efficient way for a charting setup, figuring out the best way to research, irl stuff, and being scared. I think the first two things are the main reason why I haven't made a trade this month. Remember everything listed below is opinion based on my experiences. 

**Charting setup**: After some research and time, I still do like EMA lines but have found that they can be very distracting at times. Because of this, I only stick to the 9 EMA on the 5 minute chart. I also will be going back to my classic 1 minute only chart for patterns/analysis and using the 5 minute 9 EMA chart for possible entry points. 

**How I arrange it**: Believe it or not, starting at the beginning of June I rarely used level 2. In fact, I never actually had a thing open for it. Now I realize (without losing money, thank god) it is vital for understanding if a stock will bounce/break a price point. In my eyes if you are trading pennystocks **you need level 2** period. The most efficient chart setup I found is what a lot of daytraders have.

It goes: level 2 box - time and sales box- intraday chart

That is it, simple and clean. If I need to go to the daily chart I will do that separately.  

**Best way to research:** Simple really. Open up finviz, bigcharts and yahoo finance and scan. I upload my watchlists on my blog daily so I just copy the tickers in all at once then research and develop a plan separately. 

**How I deal with irl stuff affecting my trading:** I don't.... Just do what you have to do and trade the next day. Honestly it is better then trying to trade on your phone not focused at all. 

**Afraid to trade**: This is something I don't really know why it happens. I just think ""wow thats a great risk/reward and a great trade...... But what if...."". Really screwed me out of not taking any trades this month. MCRB was a stock I was planning on buying on the dip, not really pressed but was close to pulling the trigger. Basically I wanted to buy at 31 with a small risk, once it broke 32 I knew risking on 32 for the rest of the day would be perfect. Well I never pulled the trigger on the trade and lost out on 25% (I doubt I was going to hold this IPO all day anyway). This is only because I thought ""what if it just pulls back quickly, then I lose x money for nothing"". I am not a gambler and do not have a gambling mindset on anything. Even sports/games, if a play is high risk/high reward I will not take it. I prefer the medium reward/low risk style on everything. I will have to get over it if I want to trade some of the obvious trades I'm missing. The good thing is that I know I am right 70-80% of the time I just don't execute the trade. Starting Monday I WILL TRADE.

Hope it helped. Ask questions below. ",8

All Midatech Ordinary Shares will be delivered to the holders of DARA Common Stock in the form of American Depositary Receipts (""ADRs""). Based on the current price of Midatech, each DARA share will be converted into ADRs with a value equivalent to approximately $1.20 per DARA share. The ADRs will be listed on NASDAQ. Current DARA stockholders are expected to own approximately 16% of Midatech after the closing of the transaction. Each CVR will represent the right to additional contingent cash payments in the event that certain sales milestones with respect to DARA's products Gelclair® and Oravig® are met. A maximum aggregate value of $5.7 million in cash may become due and payable to the CVR holders in 2017 and 2018 upon attainment of the defined sales thresholds in 2016 and 2017, respectively.

15-06-29,3bk379,ETFs and institutional risk,"In ""Investor's Manifesto"", the author says the following about ETFs: ""I have nothing against ETFs, but I do believe that most investors are better served by the more traditional open-end mutual funds for three reasons. ... Finally, I believe that the institutional risks of ETFs are considerable. To be blunt, I do not trust most of the ETF providers to support these products over the very long term"".

I fail to understand his message in this paragraph. He seems to assume that the institutional risk in MF is smaller than in ETF, and I don't understand why. I can see two possible explanations: either that the ETF company is more likely to go under than the MF company, or that if the company does go under, you are better off holding an MF than an ETF. But why?

A related question: legally speaking, in ETFs and MFs, who is the owner of the underlying assets? If the provider goes bust, where does the investor end up in the creditors' line? In both cases, it looks like the fund owns the securities and sells shares of itself to investors. This makes the investors equity holders and lands them at the very end of the line.

15-06-30,3bobtw,"I have a very lucrative potential investment, but no money right, how can I profit?","Ok,

So I am aware that a property is for sale through my 80 year old landlord. He told me he would be interested in selling it for a very low amount of money, if it is all cash and no inspections are involved. He wants 2 million dollars for a property that can easily be sold for triple the amount. 

Currently there are 8 units spread across 5 buildings to this large single family property. It is located in one of the top 10 most expensive zip codes in the country. I do not really want to disclose where because, it would be apparent.

I talked to one real estate agent friend about it maybe two months ago and he will not stop calling and asking if a buyer can come talk to the landlord. But that is for 3 million dollars and I would only get 3%. He made it clear to me how valuable the information I have is.. 

So, what is the best possible thing I can do? I know several people who have the capital to invest on the property, but how can I make the deal better for me? I honestly wish I could buy it because it is pulling in about 25,000 in rent monthly, the tax value is only 1.2 million ($15,000 per year) because it has not been reassessed. If I could get a loan for the money, I would sit on it and make $10,000 a month in profit.

15-06-29,3bkeln,How I grew a $4000 account into $25000 in the last 9 months,"Hey guys, I’ve been a long time lurker in this sub, so I figured I’d finally write up about how I’ve found great success this past year in the stock market. 

**Story:**

Let’s jump back in time to nine months ago: I was a freshman in college starting off the year. I had a small account of $4000 dollars that my parents graciously sent me off with, and I was looking to make some pocket change in order to cover some expenses for my college needs while trying to start paying off tuition before student loans ate me alive. I thought of all the ways that I could make some side money, and I figured that I’d try my hand at investing.
 
Once I decided to commit myself to becoming a successful investor, I started reading everything that I could get my hands on, from classics like “The Intelligent Investor” and “Think and Grow Rich” all the way to fictional works such as “Reminiscences of a Stock Market Operator”. I even started watching MSNBC on a daily basis to familiarize myself with the current markets. I learned about investing from a fundamentals standpoint, taking into consideration qualitative factors such as company performance and industry trends to predict future stock performance. But as I continued to learn more and more, I slowly started realizing that traditional methodologies of investing were not a great fit for my goals; while 20-30% gains would be considered an absolutely stellar year for many fundamental investors, those gains would translate to about 800-1200 dollars in my account over the year, which wasn’t really a great ROI for all the time I was spending researching. 

As I started to learn about other ways of generating wealth in the market, I came across the idea of day trading. I had previously heard the conventional wisdom to stay away from that risky style of playing the market, yet every day on Yahoo Finance, I was enticed by the stocks going up/dropping down 30%, 40%, sometimes even 100+%. Theoretically, these stocks could generate the same returns in one day that would take several months to accumulate through traditional investing methodologies. In reality, I knew it wasn’t realistic to think that I could catch the whole upside/downside of these big daily moves, but even catching small portion of the moves could still result in a substantial gains on a day to day basis. I decided to keep learning this style of “momentum trading”, and within a couple of weeks, I opened an E-Trade account with my initial $4000, joined an online chatroom, and began playing the market. 

Technical analysis soon became my only criteria for whether or not to trade stocks. I didn’t care what kind of fundamentals a company had, what kinds of earnings they were generating, or what kind of press they were releasing. All of that was irrelevant to the strategy, because when you’re riding the intraday price action of a momentum stock, the only thing that’s truly driving minute-to-minute price action is market emotion. These emotions can be catalyzed by fundamentals, earnings, and press releases, but when they are about to actually drive substantial price action, they manifest themselves in the form of technical indicators such as significant relative volume, breaking support/resistance, pre-market gap-ups, red/green day moves, etc…

After 2 months of taking on this new strategy, I doubled my account to $8000. I was very proud of this accomplishment, because if I had been using traditional investing methodologies, it would have taken me years to create those returns. While my early experience did come with many setbacks, I still kept learning and growing with each trade. My biggest lesson was cutting my losing trades as fast as possible, because I found myself losing money very easily when trades weren’t going my way. I also learned the extreme importance of setting good risk/reward ratios, which would help me capture big gains with the risk of small losses.

Moving through the rest of the school year, I continued growing with this strategy. Every morning, I would find stocks to trade by running filters of pre-market of stocks with unusually high volume and strong price action. After taking a look at the technical indicators and finding the catalyst for price action, I would form a hypothesis to whether the stock would keep running or not, then I would see if I could set up a low-risk/high-reward positions. After I found the right position, I would enter the trade. If the stock went the opposite direction of what I intended, I already had a minimized risk that I could cut the trade off at, whereas, when the stock went in the direction I intended, I would have a large pay-off.

Now I have made about $25,000 in the stock market, and I am extremely excited about the future. This strategy is very scalable, so the higher my account goes, the more money I can make. I hope that I have gotten you excited about trading, and that you will at least check it out before you knock it off, because there are some serious profits to be made in this market. For anyone interested, I will also provide my resources below. Please feel free to ask any questions.  

Please Note – I created a throwaway for privacy reasons.

**Resources:**

**Pennystocking Silver** – This was by far the best resource that I found for learning how to trade. The subscription that I signed up for came with access to a chatroom, filled with constant discussion of stock ideas through market hours, a huge video lesson library, and many other bonuses. Tim Sykes, the teacher, does receive some hate from people because he comes off like a douche in his YouTube videos, but once you realize that he acts that way for marketing purposes, you’ll find that he’s actually a great teacher. The price point is kinda steep for his products, but Pennystocking Silver is in the middle of the road (personally, I think the biggest bang for your buck), and in reality, you will make back the price you paid within the first couple of weeks just from saving yourself from the different mistakes you would have made going in blind and all of the exposure to trading opportunities through the chatroom. 

Link: http://profit.ly/guru/timothysykes?aff=5850

**Finviz** – This is a great free option for advanced filtering of daily stocks. During pre-market or early market hours, I usually filter for the biggest % gainers/losers along with high volume. Usually, I am looking out for low capitalization NASDAQs, because I find these are the stocks that fluctuate the most on a day-to-day basis. 

Link: www.finviz.com

**Etrade** – I loved their customer support and their consistent delivering of quality executions. Also, when you open up an account, you get 3 months of free access to their Etrade Pro software, which is amazing for charting, viewing level 2s, etc… and as long as you keep actively trading over the next couple of months, they will let you keep it permanently free of cost.

My kid is currently 5 yr old. One option is for me to put the $1000/month into a 529 plan. But I figured, for $1000/month of negative cash flow, I can also buy a property worth $500k at 10% down.

According to the service’s website, it was launched in 2011 and has accumulated more than 1 billion dollars of assets under management in just two and a half years. What made this success a reality? It’s basically due to its accessibility and affordable price. Wealthfront clients with portfolios over $10,000 pay a fixed fee of 0.25% a year. With an average price for the same service exceeding 1% elsewhere, Wealthfront appeals to many people just because it’s simple and economical. By investing in ETFs, Wealthfront achieves high asset diversification for its customers.

Betterment

Betterment is an automated American advisor considered one of the pioneers of the robo movement. This service was founded five years ago, in 2010, and currently manages portfolios for more than 50,000 clients. With Betterment, you can invest as much or as little as you choose. The more money you want to be managed, the more you’ll have to pay. For example, an investment portfolio worth $5,000 will cost $1 a month. Management of a $500,000 portfolio will cost $63. As with most of the robo-advisors, Betterment popularizes passive investing. This goal-based investing platform lets customers know if they are on track to reach their investment goals.

UK

Nutmeg

Nutmeg is the oldest UK-based online investment manager. It was launched in 2012 and since then the service has been helping people with regular incomes manage their investments. From the outset, Nutmeg stressed the importance of building a nation of intelligent retail investors in the UK. The company recognises the need to educate people about their finances and aspires to popularise the idea of investing among the British public.
Nutmeg also relies on ETFs when constructing portfolios for its clients. Fees range from 0.3% (if you invest 500,000 GBP or more) to 1% (1,000 – 25,000 GBP). The idea behind this pricing policy is simple: the bigger your portfolio, the smaller percentage of it you have to pay for the advisor’s services.

Zen Assets

Zen Assets is another option for the tech-savvy British investors. Unlike Nutmeg, it targets professional clients, who have prior experience in investing.
Members of Zen Assets’ investment board have over 30 years of combined experience in portfolio management. Prior to founding Zen Assets they have worked for Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and other City’s reputable financial institutions. They hold CFA and PhD qualifications.
Zen Assets provides investment advice for a smaller fee (when compared to banks and other brick-and-mortar wealth management institutions). According to a recent FT article1 independent financial advisors and banks cost investors slightly over 3% per year. In stark contrast, Zen Assets offers professional advice for a flat fee of 0.5%, regardless of portfolio size.

Wealth Horizon

Some of the platforms, such as Wealth Horizon, target investors stuck in the so-called “advice gap”. It appeals to people who need some guidance, but aren’t willing to pay high fees for face-to-face consultations. Wealth Horizon’s potential clients don’t use DIY investment websites because the process of decision-making seems stressful and time-consuming to them. This online money-management service will charge you an initial fee of 0.25% and then 1% per year for the ongoing investment advice.
Each online wealth management platform is unique in its own way. It would be wise to do some homework before making a commitment. Go online, look at their credentials, learn more about the key people behind each company, compare the prices.
We already shop, bank and order food online – so what keeps us from managing our investments the same way? Robo-advisors have become part and parcel of today’s financial world and the competition between them is heating up each day. What does it mean for the end users like you and me? Better quality advice and significantly lower prices.

15-06-30,3bksa4,Stocks Down Due to Greek Drama - A note from my investment manager,"I got this message from my investment manager this afternoon. I thought I would share.

**Stocks Down Due to Greek Drama**

Stocks dropped in response to headlines from Greece, where surprising developments over the weekend led to Greece's banks and stock exchange closing for at least a week. For perspective, Greece's shrunken economy is about the same size as Louisiana's and less than 2% of Europe's. The country has struggled with high debts throughout its history and defaulted multiple times. 

**Why Are These Familiar Troubles Triggering a Drop in U.S. Stocks?**

Greece's recurring problems cause concerns about Europe and the future of the euro, the common currency used by Greece as well as 18 other European countries. Uncertainty is contagious, and U.S. stocks have also dropped due to these concerns. However, we think the fundamentals of economic and earnings growth are improving globally. The troubles in Greece are likely to have only a minimal effect, so we recommend that long-term investors stay invested and add quality stocks, including international investments, if appropriate. 

**Greece Faces Tough Choices**

Greece's debts are high, and the economy has been in recession for most of the past six years, shrinking more than 25% from 2009. The current bailout agreement is over on July 1, and Greece wanted additional bailout money on easier terms. However, other European leaders wanted Greece to make more painful spending cuts and economic reforms. 

**Here's What Happened**
 
*For the past few years, Greece and its creditors have reached agreements at the last minute, and that outcome seemed likely this time, too. 
 
*Instead, Greece called a surprise referendum for July 5, shut the banks and imposed limits on withdrawals to stem the flood of money leaving the banks. European leaders refused to extend the current bailout. 
 
*As a result, Greece will almost certainly default on its June 30 payment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

While most expect that Greece will vote on July 5 to accept more austerity and stay in the euro, no one is certain what will happen next. 

**Markets Hate Uncertainty, But Investors See Opportunities**

In the past, concerns about Greece were much greater because other European countries were also in recession and had similarly high debts, and European banks owned a lot of Greek debt. Today, the situation is better: 

 
*Other European countries have lowered their government debts by spending less and raising taxes. 
 
*Most of Europe has returned to growth, although weak. 
 
*Most of Greece's debt is owned by international institutions like the IMF, not European banks.

As a result, the impact of Greece's troubles on the rest of Europe is much less today than in the recent past. 

Regardless, stocks hate surprises, and Greece is likely to continue to cause uncertainty and more short-term market volatility. But the global economy is growing, and companies are still increasing their sales and earnings. That's why we think lower prices offer opportunities for investors. Consider adding quality stocks using the stronger dollar, and consider investing internationally, if appropriate. More importantly, keep your investments aligned with your long-term financial goals, not with the short-term headlines from Greece. ",219
15-06-30,3bkswv,"Are you worried that you're not worried about Greece?","Most of us fancy ourselves contrarians. It's in a lot of people's nature to go against the grain.

So when we see a headline like ""Stocks fall as Street fears Grexit"" or something similar, we scoff. We brush Greece off as some small, inconsequential basket case of a nation with an economy the size of (insert large U.S. city here).

It seems like more people than not are taking the view that Greece won't ultimately affect us. We see ourselves as contrarians by dismissing the possibility that Grexit could affect the U.S. economy and therefore our stock exchanges.

But I don't think we're contrarians--I think we're overlooking this. I think the contrarians are actually concerned about Greece because most average investors are not. I don't know why, and I can't completely explain it, but it just doesn't feel right. If Greece is not a big deal, why did the S&amp;P have its worst sell-off in years today?

I know about as much as any average investor about the Greece situation, mostly because I never figured it'd be a serious idea to spend time reading about. But now I'm starting to worry that it doesn't seem like other people are worried.

We've got a ""just buy the dip, Greece doesn't matter!"" mentality. Most people are convinced this will blow over in a couple weeks. But isn't that how we get burned? Big market crashes are so bad specifically because few people see them coming, or they brush off the warning signs.

I'm wondering if our ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ attitude towards Greece could burn us worse than many think is possible. Again, I can't explain why. I can't bust out data points and figures and this and that to back up my case. I just don't like the fact that so few people seem concerned, including myself.

Anyone feel the same?",12

15-06-30,3bmjkk,20! About to start investing but still slightly confused about where to go,"Hi /r/invest!

Just a quick introduction, I'm 20 this year from Singapore and I'm looking to start going into investment. Have saved up a bit over the years, about SGD$7k and wanted to start putting those savings into good use! Had a few questions after researching for bout 2 months of so cause i really wanted to be sure before going into things.

1. How much should I be looking to invest? The rough number in my head right now is about 60% of my savings (SGD$4k) but is this too high for a beginner investor? 

2. Where should I be looking into first? As a context, I do have time to do the research and I'm young enough to be able to take some risk but I'm painfully inexperienced. I was thinking of either (a) Going into blue chip stocks or (b) Going into a mutual fund (helps with the inexperience)

3. How quickly should I expect things to move? What should my general position be? Long term or short term? Quite clueless about this. I'm young so I'm able to go long term, but I have the time so I'm able to go short term as well

4. Where do I go from here? I've read up online, on books on how to start investing, types of investment and some types of investment strategies but I still don't feel as if I'm in any position to make a learned decision yet. Any suggestions on how where I go from here?

Thank you in advance for your help!",1

15-06-30,3blt3u,5 Tips For Landlords,"Everyone knows that property is one of the most popular forms of investment. Unlike shares, bonds, trusts etc. property has an extra safety-net in that people will always need somewhere to live. That said, this by no means guarantees that any property investment is a good one. House prices fluctuate, as do the rental returns – not to mention the fact that mortgage interest rates are also variable.
All things considered, property remains high on the list of possible investments for many and perhaps one of the biggest factors in making the investment a success is – THE TENANTS! Here are five tips for potential buy to let property investors:
 
Always Use a Contract
When you are first setting out in the property investment world, it can be tempting to cut corners to save a few pounds. Furthermore, you may already have possible tenants in mind; friends, family or even work colleagues. I previously lived with another couple back at University in my friends house and things actually got pretty ugly when it was time to leave. The other couple had informally agreed to live there for 6 months and wanted to leave after 4. There was no contract in place between ‘friends’ and as a consequence the friendship was no more – Don’t mix business with pleasure if possible.
Others will try and wrangle their way out of contracts on technicalities. In the UK a number of ‘standard’ contracts exist, so you won’t have to pay a lawyer to write one from scratch and solicitor’s rates can actually be pretty reasonable. If you want to save more money, you can actually download one of the tenancy agreements online and edit it yourself – although it might be an idea to have a lawyer check it over.
 
Get the Mortgage Overpayments Right
When you are investing in property, it can be tempting to get too carried away with the numbers. While paying of your mortgage(s) early is a great idea in principle, ensure that you don’t set yourself up for a fall. Reduced term mortgaged (15 years instead of 25 years for example) are very popular, but can also get you into deep water if the interest rates rise or your property goes through a period of being empty. Check with your mortgage provider, but you can often make overpayments within a given limit (usually 10% of the balance) without paying a penalty. This way, you can take a 25 year mortgage and overpay as and when you can afford to – you are not obligated to meet the higher monthly repayments.
 
Have a Contingency Fund
Unlike with stock and shares, an investment in property often requires ‘topping up’ to ensure that it continues to provide a sizable return. Curtains, carpets, walls, furniture, gardens etc. all need repairing and fixing at some point. Many landlords will charge tenants from their security deposit if they are directly responsible for the breakage of something, but soft furnishings all get tired with time. It might be a good idea to keep a ‘spares and repairs account‘ for the unexpected replacement of an appliance or to help you pay the mortgage if there is a gap between tenants.
 
Use an Agency or Do It Yourself?
The temptation when buying property as an investment is to think that you can manage it all by yourself. As your empire starts to grow, the demand on your time will also increase. Agencies charge a small fee, but can take care of many of the tedious tracks in the process. You don’t want a criminal or somebody who was evicted for trashing their last flat moving right into yours do you? Agencies can provide background checks for a fee – which you can usually pass on to the tenants and also take care of any midnight call-outs – not to mention finding the tenants in the first place!
 
Ensure That You are Insured
While this might seem blatantly obvious, it is by far the most important consideration of the lot. In my five years experience of being a student, I know of at least two groups of people who caused a fire and had to move out while the fire damage was repaired. Taking the toaster into your bedroom when you are blitzed may seem like a good idea at the time; but bed covers and heating elements don’t go well together! Many specialist companies like CIA Insurance can offer policies and advice to ensure that you have the right level of cover. The last thing that any property investor wants is to owe the bank a mortgage for a property that was destroyed. Fire is not the only force that can be of detriment to your rental – flooding, mold or disastrous tenants can all cause your property value to plummet!

15-06-30,3bmyz8,Long term monitoring,"Hello! I'm almost entirely new to the stock market, but I've been doing some lurking here for a while. A long time ago, I composed a short list of tickers (two to be exact) that I felt had potential, and sure enough they've only ever really been on the rise.
What I'm wondering is, would that inherently make them a good buy? Had I purchased them then (3 years ago) would I have turned a profit, or is there something I'm not paying attention to? The tickers specifically are IBA( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=IBA+ticker ) and CF ( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=CF+ticker ).

During my last semester in college I have tried my best to gain all the knowledge on investing as possible. I didn't have much money then so I couldn't really do much. I put a little money into betterment and set up an auto deposit for the minimum amount per month and I also bought a few index funds using sharebuilder but nothing too extensive. 

I am now out of college, have no loans to take care of, just a little credit card debt. I just got a 50k paying job for a 6 month contract so if I don't get hired on as permanent or my contract doesn't get extended then ill have to look for a new job.
 
I went to a financial advisor at my bank last week with bank of america and he suggested I start an account with Merrill Lynch and open up a Roth. He threw terms at me which I all knew due to reading the suggested books listed on here and my personal research. My goal when I got out of college was to have a plan in which I could start accumulating wealth for both short term and long term (stocks/bonds + real estate). My plan was to open a Roth IRA with vanguard and max it out every year, have a seperate taxable brokerage account with vanguard as well where I could create my own personal portfolio. Then I wanted to invest in real estate as well to have more short term gains (I have yet to do enough research into  real estate to be comfortable enough to invest). Of course I also plan to have at least 6 months worth or savings which I calculated to be about 3k since I don't have my own place and am still living with my parents. I'm not sure when I will move out, most likely when I need to, which I don't see happening in the near future. 

So my questions are, should I go with Merrill Lynch right now since it is affiliated with my bank account or just open an account with Vanguard and forget about ML? Also, what do you guys think of my plan? Am I missing something? 

Thank you for taking the time to read this and helping me out.",4
15-06-30,3bnw5q,How are you guys playing the greek referendum? US markets closed Friday,"I think the markets zoom up on a yes, despite it having no material change on the financial outcome, but it is more positive than a no.

Greek media is pro-yes, the government is currently pro-no but may change its stance to pro-yes to sway voters and get more favorable bailout terms.

How are you going to trade this? Straddles will suck on the IV-crush if market rallies, but will gain better if market tanks, in which case you are still better off just betting bearish.

Got a better spread?

Or a strategy which caps losses better than a call/put?

15-06-30,3boa0r,What happens if everyone tries to sell their ETFs at the same time?,"I'm just reading [this commentary by ""bond guru Bill Gross""](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bill-gross-is-worried-about-liquidity-and-a-run-on-the-shadow-banks-2015-06-30) and it really made me thin. Here's the key part of it:

&gt;“Mutual funds, hedge funds, and ETFs, are part of the ‘shadow banking system’ where these modern ‘banks’ are not required to maintain reserves or even emergency levels of cash,” wrote Gross, a portfolio manager at Janus Capital following his much-discussed departure from Pimco in September.

&gt;“Since they in effect now are the market, a rush for liquidity on the part of the investing public, whether they be individuals in 401Ks or institutional pension funds and insurance companies, would find the ‘market’ selling to itself with the Federal Reserve severely limited in its ability to provide assistance.”

Is this an increasing worry as more and more people put their money into ETFs? Any folks here have particular thoughts on this? It feels to me like it's a legitimate concern.

15-06-30,3boacj,"Is Greece's Debt crisis like Latin America's from a few decades ago?","If we look at the Latin American Debt crisis of 1970-1990 and Thailand in 1997 -- we see that lack of credibility from foreign investors as well as low foreign reserves result in a financial crisis. How is Greece different than these two situations?

These past issues came about when countries and foreign banks were lending more than they should have been -- say, to countries like Argentina (1970-1980s).
They defaulted on their loans and this caused Latin American countries to see incredible financial crisis due to skyrocketing interest rates and low foreign reserves.

As I see it, Greece is headed in the same direction. How do we prepare (as U.S. Investors) for a financial crisis? What will Greece's debt default mean in terms of the going price of one Euro?

Also, my biggest question, Should Greece just float a domestic currency instead of staying pegged to the euro?",3
