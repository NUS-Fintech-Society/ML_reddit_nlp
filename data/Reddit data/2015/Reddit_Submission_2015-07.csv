15-07-01,3bp2ip,The future of cable? The next big thing?,"Hey Investors!

Look around your house and find the most outdated piece of hardware. It's not your television, furniture, cellphone, etc.. It's your cable box! But, how could that be? You spend so much and commit to long term contracts. If you ever wondered why your cable box doesn't allow you any interaction, or present a seamless on-demand program without glitching, you're not alone! If it enrages you that it costs an extra 10$/month for HD which is almost universally in everyone's home now, you're not alone! 

This industry is packed with big players who maintain some of the most hateful and disappointing reputations. They haven't properly adapted with the times and they are sucking the people dry. 

So, my question to you is: who do you think will attack this industry with progress and take it by storm? ",2

This is perhaps the most interesting take I've gotten on the whole Greek debt situation from UMKC research professor Michael Hudson. He basically says that in the back offices of the IMF it was known that Greece couldn't pay back its debt but then-IMF chief Dominique Strass-Kahn rebuffed IMF staffers for political reasons. He goes on to discuss just what's behind this fruitless effort to pile bailout loan after bailout loan on top of Greece and he explains why exactly it's taken so long for Greece to default even though it has been obvious the whole time that this was going to be the obvious conclusion. Anyone have any more thoughts on this?

15-07-01,3bp91f,"DoubleDown SGYP&gt;SGYPW=YOLO^2","Went all in w/ 500 SGYP @ 2.89 in a newly created IRA.  Today I sold half @ 8.25 and immediately bought 600 SGYPW @ 3.6.  I now essentially owned 2.4x more shares.  Although at a new cost basis of 9.08 should I exercise in December @ 5.48.  But doesn't matter, this company is about to have 2 best in class drugs for a growing, undiagnosed market.  Worst case scenario, its a buyout at IWRD levels in the low teens. 

So, by shaving 8.5% profit off the top I now own 2.4x more shares.  Why aren't I doing this for the rest of the original position? Right??

Math Edit: The loss of 8.5% profit would apply to the original 250.  But for the same capital I would be getting 600 @ 9.08 + the $195 I would lose as previously mentioned (about $.55 a share).  New cost basis with the opportunity to buy 600 is about $9.64.  

With a buy out @ 15 my original profit would have been an additional 6.75 per share x 250 = 1687.5

With SGYPW it would be 5.36 profit x 600 = 3216

so yea.  I think i am going to re-double down tomorrow when the price spikes as usual. ",1

Graham gets into topics to fast without even explaining stuff.
For example on page 2 he gets into talking about levels and how the DJIA was at 300. What the hell does that even mean ""to be at 300. He never explains stuff and assumes you know it.

Overall this book is something I would not recommend for the incredibly layman. You need some background in accounting terms or something at least.

Also he writes as if he's trying to impress someone... Unnecessary complicated english.

Also his chapter on inflation and the investor went right into detail without even explaining or conceptualizing how inflation does affect stock or bond prices. I still don't get it. Sigh

An unsuccesful Iranian deal would send oil prices up (because their stored oil will stay put) and a succesful deal would send them down (unleashing millions of barrels onto the market).

I don't see a middle ground, all of these events are possible and the described results on the markets will follow them.

A yes-vote in Greece and failed nuclear talks are easy: go long and sit back. Buy the German index for example or just buy oil.

A no-vote and succesful nuclear talks are more difficult: go short.

I trade CFD's via Plus500 (risky business for a beginner) and there a two options: the buy button and the short button.

Hopefully these play out

EDIT. Okay forgot to mention I'm trading the SPY. 

How I get my trades: Its basically using Implied volatility, without actually calculating implied volatility. I do this by visually charting the previous week's price range. I then use this range as the ""STD"" and mark this down for the following week. From here, I have my present price points of where the SPY must hit, before I enter a spread. I also have secondary spreads lined up for if it breaks through my initial credit spread. The goal is to have a full on Iron Condor by mid week and let everything just expire worthless. I don't take more than 4 spreads and no less than 0.09 credit on the first and try to get 0.06 on the second. If all goes well, you'll have two spreads in play. 

Its not a secret, I'm not selling anything, I'm not claiming I can beat the market and I'm not claiming to be any sort of guru. Just doing this as a hobby.

my ideal portfolio goal though, at least mine is, is to amass a large enough dividend portfolio, where each stock is worth a low single digit % of the total portfolio. From there, I will turn these into covered call positions and use part of the dividends to trade spreads. 

I trade as a hobby and enjoy doing it. That's why I do it.",1

http://seekingalpha.com/article/3296745-nu-skin-enterprises-patience-is-called-for

TL;DR

* A company with a history of growth in revenue and earnings, and a strong presence in China.
* Rollout of new product lines in 2014/2015 expected to have positive effects on revenue growth.
* Macro issues of a SEC probe and ongoing regulatory scrutiny in China introduces a significant degree of uncertainty in the short / medium term.
* A 2.8% dividend yield that is well covered by current net profit.

[Read my latest Yahoo! analysis here](http://prosperityactiveyield.tumblr.com/post/122952683538/quantifying-uncertainty-in-yahoo)

If you've read any of my other articles, you're probably sick of hearing me opine on my long YHOO short BABA position.  You've seen the SOTP valuations before, and you know that YHOO trades at a SOTP discount.  I wanted to examine how large that discount should be by looking at three different scenarios:

**The Worst-Case Scenario:**

* Both BABA and YHOO JPN taxed at 40% assuming $0 cost basis.

* The resulting proceeds are then used unwisely.

* Discounts applied to remaining assets.

* YHOO Core valued at 8x FY16 EPS

**The Moderate Scenario:**

* BABA holding is spun off tax-free.

* YHOO JPN is taxed at 40% with a $0 cost basis

* Moderate discounts applied to remaining assets.

* YHOO Core valued at 8x FY16 EPS

**The Best-Case Scenario:**

* Both BABA and YHOO JPN holdings are spun off tax-free.

* Moderate discounts applied to remaining assets.

* YHOO Core trades at a P/E multiple comprable to that of the SPX, 17

**Results:**

* Worst-Case Scenario Estimated Market Value per Share: $39.43 (almost no change from current)

* Moderate Scenario Estimated Market Value per Share: $52.83 (+34% from current)

* Best-Case Scenario Estimated Market Value per Share: $61.06 (+55% from current)

The [initial announcement](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20141113006642/en/Graham-Holdings-Spin-Off-Cable-Division) was made in November.  

[The ""of record date"" was announced on June 4](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150604006397/en/Graham-Holdings-Company-Declares-Spin-off-Dividend-Cable). On June 4 you could have bought for 1,060.  On June 16 you could have sold for $1,050, but you would be of record for the spin off.  You still would have been entitled to CABO shares which will open tomorrow at about $400.

Now that the spin off is complete GHC is at $680 (yahoo finance shows GHC is up today, correctly showing that shareholders have not lost money since yesterday since they're receiving CABO shares).  

So assuming you're long GHC since before June 15, why couldn't you have just sold it yesterday for $1,098, still collect your shares of CABO since you were of record on 6/15, and then buy GHC back today if you wanted for $680?

Hansen Medical(R) Announces FDA Clearance of the Magellan(TM) 10Fr Robotic Catheter

4:30 pm ET July 1, 2015 (Market Wire) Print
Hansen Medical(R), Inc. (NASDAQ: HNSN), the global leader in intravascular robotics, today announced that it received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance for its Magellan(TM) 10Fr Robotic Catheter for use in the peripheral vasculature. The FDA clearance enables the company to initiate clinical use of the 10Fr catheter with its customers in the United States.

The Magellan 10Fr Robotic Catheter is the latest addition to the family of robotic catheters used with the Magellan Robotic System. The 10Fr catheter allows for independent, robotic control of two telescoping catheters (an outer Guide and an inner Leader catheter). The Guide catheter has a 10Fr outer diameter, and features the largest inner lumen (7Fr) in the Magellan catheter family, which enables delivery of therapeutic devices through the robotic catheter in a broader range of endovascular procedures. The company received CE Mark approval for the 10Fr catheter in April 2015, and procedures have subsequently been performed with the device in Australia, Germany and the United Kingdom.

""We have been eagerly anticipating having access to the Magellan 10Fr Robotic Catheter,"" said Dr. Fred Weaver, Chief of Vascular Surgery and Endovascular Therapy at Keck Hospital of the University of Southern California (USC). ""Our team has found significant clinical value in the Magellan system to predictably navigate tortuous vascular anatomy and provide a stable platform during treatment. The 10Fr catheter, with its larger inner lumen, will enable us to broaden our use of Magellan to include many additional procedures in which the delivery of stents, balloons or other devices requires a 7Fr catheter inner lumen.""

The Magellan Robotic System is an advanced technology that drives Magellan Robotic Catheters and guide wires during minimally-invasive, endovascular procedures. Magellan is designed to offer procedural predictability, precision, and catheter stability as physicians navigate inside blood vessels and deliver therapy. Image-guided medical procedures using interventional fluoroscopy, while growing rapidly, are the leading source of occupational ionizing radiation exposure for medical personnel(1). Magellan's remote workstation allows physicians to control robotic catheters and guide wires while seated away from the radiation field, which has been shown to reduce radiation exposure for the physician by as much as 95% in complex endovascular procedures(2).

""We are excited to introduce the Magellan 10Fr Robotic Catheter to our customers in the United States,"" said Cary Vance, President and Chief Executive Officer of Hansen Medical. ""We believe that robotic technology offers the potential to transform how endovascular treatment is performed, by bringing enhanced control and predictability to procedures, and by addressing serious occupational hazards faced by physicians and their teams in the delivery of patient care. With this new catheter, we expect that many more patients will now be able to benefit from procedures with the Magellan Robotic System.""",2

15-07-02,3btkth,Teaching my son about investing - 529 vs UTMA vs Guardian account,"Hey all,

I was hoping to get some guidance, or at least educated recommendations on strategies to teach a young child to invest.

I started teaching my son about the importance of saving money around the time that he was 2-3 years old. He's now 6, and he has proven himself to fully understand what it is to save money (while also using some of his money on things he enjoys). For example, of the money he received for his birthday, he used some of it to buy a Disney Infinity character he liked, and opted to save the rest (on his own - no parental influence - I promise).

At this point, I'd like to start teaching him about investing. He's demonstrated a curiosity in it, as he likes to sit with me when I check my portfolio / analyze the market.

At this point, I'm trying to decide between a 529, UTMA, or a Guardian account for him.

In my research, I've gathered the following information:

529: Funds used strictly for education - if the child receives a full scholarship, the funds can be withdrawn from the 529 without penalty. If not all funds are used to pay for undergraduate schooling, they can be used for graduate school as well.

UTMA: My son will have access to the funds when he is either 18 or 21. The funds don't have to be spent on education, and there are some tax advantages in comparison to a Guardian account. A UTMA account could bite him in the ass when it comes to getting financial aid in college, as the funds are considered his assets.

Guardian account: The account is under my name, and I can transfer it to him whenever I see fit. There are no restrictions on what the funds should be intended for. The account is under my name, so it won't have as much of an impact as a UTMA account would have on financial aid. However, income from the funds would be taxed at the standard rate.

So my question is: **Which of the 3 accounts would be best used to not only put my son in a good place financially when he's 18/21, but also be a good option to teach him the importance (and, in time, the ins and outs) of investing?**

He told me he wants to buy stock in Disney, though I am leaning towards an index fund of some sort.

Would probably start with $500.

**TLDR**; Looking to teach 6-year old son about investing. $500 to start. Debating between 529, UTMA, and Guardian account.",8

Business Insider had an article that claimed the future value at 8% for Option 1 was 104.1 million while Option 2 was 95.2 million.  When I calculate the options at 8% the future values are almost identical at 87.233 million.  Would someone mind trying to re-calculate the future values? I have tried using online calculators &amp; Excel, not sure if I have an issue or if the editor was lazy.  

As an aside, the writer of the article obviously thought Option 1 was beneficial to the player.  I would argue that a professional sports team rate should be closer to the risk-free rate, around 3%.  In that case Option 2 would be clearly superior for the player.  ",2

15-07-02,3bul6d,What decision a skillful investor would take when analyzing whether or not to buy shares from Eastman Kodak Co. ($KODK),"Eastman Kodak Co. ($KODK) established a new 52-week low yesterday, and could be a company to watch at the open. After opening at $16.72, Eastman Kodak Co. dropped to $16.54 for a new 52-week low. By the closing bell, the company's stock was at $16.80 a share for a gain of 1.27%.

Falling to a new 52-week low is never fun for company's shareholder, but, depending on who you ask, it can be either a buy or a sell signal. Someone bearish on the stock might see it reaching its lowest price in a year as a sign of growing downward momentum and make sure they sell their shares. Bulls, though, are more likely to see a new 52-week low as the stock hitting its low point and anticipate a bounce in the share price.
However one plays it, it's often a critical moment for any stock and should be noted by investors.",0

15-07-02,3bupks,Moving abroad: The Check-list,"Only three days until I get on that plane, cross the Ocean and settle on my land in Guatemala!!!

As I am preparing the final details, I am trying not to forget anything before I go.

I am not talking about the material, people abroad eat, drink and dress just like you, so anything you forget, you can buy.

I am trying to prepare everything administratively, financially, etc. so I don’t have to call my mum for an emergency after a week. She is very kind and takes care of my mail while I am away, she scans the letters over to me, and I don’t want her to have much more to do.

Check-list for the ”old” country
Tell your landlord that you are moving
Sounds pretty obvious, but make sure you are early enough as some agreements require a couple of months’ notice. If not, try to negotiate with your landlord, if you find a replacement early enough, not to be penalized.

Close your accounts
Electricity, gas, internet, cable, phone providers, call them all to know the procedure. Again, it can take weeks, and you can be charged an early exit fee.

Keep your bank account
A bank account is hard to reopen should you come back, because you won’t have a proof of address or an employment contract anymore. So keep your account open, close any paying services, and ask about the fees you will be charged should you want to send money abroad, or use your credit/debit card in your new country.

Visit your doctor
You should still have a health coverage in your ”old” country, so go make sure everything is fine before you go, renew your prescriptions, and buy them all. Get the recommended shots for the new country. You will have a few months to start up a new policy, find a doctor and so on.

Moving your stuff
I have lived in five countries and usually get there with a bag of clothes and essentials, then buy furniture and sell when I move. If you want to bring your stuff with you, know that it will probably take weeks and be expensive. However it never hurts to check long distance moving companies for pricing because you might want the comforts of home while living abroad.

Consider getting rid of your basic furniture, and getting some over there. You can also leave the nicer pieces in storage if you are coming back.

Time to clear customs, and you may live in an empty house for a while, so anything essential, carry with you.

Renew your passport and get an international driving license
If your passport expires soon, get a new one, specially if you are not going to live in a city with a US consulate. Also consider getting an international driving license to rent and drive a car abroad.

Check-list for the ”new” country
Learn how much as you can
Browse forums and start learning about security, habits, rules… If the new country is known for tourist scams, be extra careful. The embassy usually has a good list of things to do and avoid. Learn the basics of the language if you can. Check how much the currency is worth to avoid confusion. Have in mind the price of a taxi from the airport and a few basic things in order to be charged a fair price.

Call immigration
BEFORE you go, depending on the purpose and length of your stay, you may need a certain type of visa. For example if I (French) go to the US as a tourist, I get 90 days to stay. Should I decide to start working, I have to go back to France, apply for a working visa, then come back. Make sure you take the best visa to avoid a trip home and back.

Get temporary accommodation
I committed the mistake when I moved to the UK to get a 6 months rental. After two weeks I didn’t get along with my roommates, the location was unpleasant and I wanted to move out, but was stuck. Find a place for a month, again via Airbnb or Craigslist, and start exploring all the neighborhoods. Where will you work? How far is the bus/train stop? How convenient is it to live there? This first month’s rental should be more expensive but you will know the market better and find a nicer place with more times on your hands.

What to do with your house?
It all comes down to whether you are coming back or not. If you are taking a sabbatical, or traveling the world for a year, do you want to keep your house?

As a homeowner, you can rent your house while you are away, long term or short term. Both have pros and cons. Long term, the tenants may not want to move out when you come back, and short term, you would need someone to cover the cleanup and the check-in and out of the renters. Make sure you are properly insured.

As a tenant, you should check your agreement and if it allows sublets (rare), you can list it on Airbnb or Craigslist. If not, talk to your landlord, he might agree to a temporary sublet.

In any case, you will probably want to rent a storage unit to keep your valuable items out of reach. Those are expensive and maybe a trip to your parents’ or friends’ before you go to drop your things off will be cheaper. I keep everything at my mum’s, because I never know how long I will be away for.

Set up your services
Get a pay as you go cellphone while you browse for a proper phone plan. Ask your employer to provide a reference to get utilities set up, and a bank account. Talking to other expats can help a great deal, they went through it too.

Bring your money
You will probably want to bring over a bit of savings to get setup at first. Usually when I open a foreign bank account I use currency exchange services to wire money, like Currency Online, as their commission is lower than normal banks (about 1% of the amount against 2%). it is also safer than carrying a lot of cash with you on your first day.

Make sure you have a nice emergency fund as there are many fees to cover when you first arrive somewhere. You need to fill up your fridge and cupboards, buy cleaning products, maybe bed sheets and towels, tuition for the kids, connecting fees for internet and your phone, buy a car, pay the first month and a month’s deposit on a rental, and so on. And if you are moving, like me, to a cheap country like Guatemala, you will be overcharged because you are foreign, until you learn the real price of things. Expect the first couple of months to be super expensive.

 Do you have other things to add to a checklist before moving to a new house?",1

15-07-02,3buz60,Insanely great investing page,"There are really 4 opportunities to earn with traffic monsoon -&gt; link of page: http://tinyurl.com/odljl4r 

-- paid to click 
-- using ad services to generate leads to make money in your primary business 
-- revenue sharing 
-- direct sales commissions 

Each one can be your main focus, or all of them. Naturally, the more you utilize all 4 of these ways to earn money, the more money you'll earn. 

Paid to click is very simple. There are cash links that appear on your member dashboard. 

To click and earn from these does not require any purchase. You can refer more people to click these cash links, and you'll earn from their clicks too. 

The only thing to remember is to click at least 10 ads in the traffic exchange to qualify for your referral clicks. This qualification lasts for 24 hours, so it's best to click your 10 ads to qualify each 24 hours-- and it's recommended to qualify before the timer runs out so you don't risk losing any referral clicks. 

One member posted on Facebook that they have earned $0.10 from cash links in the last 24 hours. 

Let's expand on that. 

If you click all the cash links and earn $0.10 -- if you had 10 referrals earning the same, even if they are free members, you would have earned $1.10 from cash links. 

Multiply that through 30 days, and that's over $30 in earnings from people who never made a purchase. 

You can get paid directly to your paypal, payza, or solid trust pay account. 

More referrals will be more money for you. 

10 referrals X $0.10 earnings from cash links X 30 days = $30 from your referral clicks 
10 referrals X $0.10 earnings from cash links X 365 days = $365 from your referral clicks 
500 referrals X $0.10 earnings from cash links X 30 days = $1,500 from your referral clicks 
500 referrals X $0.10 earnings from cash links X 365 days = $18,250 from your referral clicks 
1000 referrals X $0.10 earnings from cash links X 30 days = $3,000 from your referral clicks 
1000 referrals X $0.10 earnings from cash links X 365 days = $36,500 from your referral clicks 

This is not a guarantee of income, but an example of what you can earn by referring new members to Traffic Monsoon who click on cash links. 

There's no purchase necessary. So the real way to multiply your earnings is through referring new members to use the services, and click on cash links. 

Using the advertising services is pretty simple and easy to use too. 

Most experienced marketers use lead capture pages, or have developed their own brand. Even if you haven't developed your own website, you're likely involved in something else that has a referral link. 

You can advertise on Traffic Monsoon to a targeted audience of people all seeking to earn more money online from their homes. It's more than likely that all the visitors on Traffic Monsoon are already earning something online within a program of some sort, and might be looking for help to earn more. Many of these people are not as skilled as you are, and with your help they could help grow your downlines in other things. 

Each of the services are low in price, but high in value and quality. Each service is completely visitor based, so you're sure to get real visitors to your website to review what you have to offer. 

The next way to earn is revenue sharing. 

This is very simple and easy to understand too. 

When Traffic Monsoon gets paid, the profits from those purchases are shared with the members. 

So instead of keeping that money, Traffic Monsoon has a plan for each member to qualify for their share of the profits. 

The important thing to recognize is that first sales of services happen, and the customer receives their service that they paid for. 

Then, the revenues from that purchase are set aside. When members who have sharing positions click a minimum of 10 ads in the traffic exchange, they qualify for a share in the revenues for 24 hours. 

How do you get a revenue sharing position? 

Revenue sharing positions are included in the $50 adpack, which gives you 1000 visitors to your website, and 20 clicks on your banner. Every click on your banners ads is worth a lot - those users who click on your ads may become your referrals or even clients. Users click simply because they are interested in the topic of your ads! 

So by clicking the minimum 10 ads per day in the traffic exchange, you are qualified to share in the company's profits up to $55. 

Each visit you make in the traffic exchange also gives you a free visitor credit. Surfing more than 10 ads helps you generate more free traffic to your website to help you generate more leads, sign-ups, and sales. 

Free member clicks reward 1/2 as many credits as paid members. Any purchase makes the account a life time paid member. 

The 4th way to make money with Traffic Monsoon is direct sales. 

When you refer anyone to use the services on TrafficMonsoon, you'll earn 10% commissions on all their purchases and repurchases. This isn't a 1-time fast-start bonus for referring new members-- this is a continual flow of commissions as your referrals continue to use the services to generate traffic to their websites. 

Many people who are involved in buying the adpacks with the revenue sharing positions are using earnings to repurchase more adpacks to multiply their earnings from sharing. Each sharing position receives the same amount, so the more revenue sharing positions you have, the more you multiply the amount you receive. 

So if they continually build up the number of adpack sharing positions they have by using their earnings, you'll continually receive $5 on each adpack purchase and repurchase they buy. 

One traffic exchange ranking site that ranks traffic exchanges based upon results has rated Traffic Monsoon as #1 this week, and the last few weeks too. 

Since our services are of such quality, and low pricing-- there's a lot of value which generates repurchases just for that reason. 

So the revenues remain steady for sharing, especially since everyone in the home based business industry can benefit from the services we offer. 

Also here are the proofs how i earned in 2 days:

At the moment, it looks like their government are going to use a large amount of resources to delay the pop and soften the blow once it does happen. They are willing to bail out Greece, they are lowering interest rates (Just like the US in 2006), and they are fixated on maintaining the insane growth they experienced over the last decade, which is impossible. I can't wait for the pop, but I am also going to play the volatility on the way down with long term options if I make a bad play.  ",2

15-07-02,3bw3v1,Should I add bonds and REITs to my dividend growth portfolio?,"23 y/o dividend growth investor here. Right now I have all of my investments exclusively in dividend growth ETF's. My strategy is to continue investing in dividend growth stocks/funds and let the dividends compound over my lifetime in my tax advantaged accounts. With that in mind I wanted some opinions on diversifying my portfolio specifically with bonds and REITS. My biggest questions are: 

1. Should I be investing in bond ETFs/Funds even with the inevitable interest rate hikes and the already conservative nature of my portfolio? Would it be best to invest in a fund that specializes in short, intermediate, or longterm bonds (maybe even a mixture)? Would it still be worth converting a small portion of my portfolio into bonds (10%)?

2. Same question with REITs. Should I invest in REITs with the same interest rate hikes or would it be better to just continue investing in my dividend growth funds until the interest rate issue becomes a little more stable? Also if I were to invest in REITs given my age what would be an appropriate allocation? 10, 15, or even 20%?

EDIT: I don't know if it's helpful or not to know but any investments I make will be in ETF's (most likely through vanguard) like VNQ, BLV, etc. I get them commission free and it gives me plenty of diversity right away. 

I'm still learning a lot about these things so any insight or pointing me in the direction of where I can learn more would be greatly appreciated!",16

15-07-03,3bxne0,5 Wealth Building Tips From the Millionaire Next Door,"Millionaires – they’re everywhere these days. In 2013 there was a record breaking 12 million of them spread throughout the world, with most of them living right here in our own neighborhoods of North America. With the economy in healthy shape, researchers are expecting this number to continue climbing in coming years.

Do you want to be the next one added to this list?

Well, you can if you heed the advice of others already there. Most millionaires have certain characteristics in common. They didn’t simply wake up one day to find a seven figure number in their bank account. For most it was the result of hard work, investing wisely, and managing their money properly.

If you want to be the next addition to the millionaire list, pay attention to these 5 wealth building tips from the millionaire next door who’s already there.

1. Live frugally

Living frugally probably isn’t the first thing that comes to mind when you think of millionaires, right? After all, they’re the ones taking exotic vacations, owning nice homes, and buying expensive toys.

However, if you were to look into their past you’d likely find that they willingly lived below their means for a period of time.

Living frugally allowed them you to establish a strong financial base, which gave them the financial leverage to live the life they live today. After all, you can’t become wealthy when you’re paying 15% APR on that credit card debt that takes forever to pay down.

2. Start investing…yesterday

If you interview just about any millionaire you’re likely to find that many of them began building their wealth at an early age. By investing while young, they were able harness the power of compounding interest to their benefit, which allowed their wealth to build significantly over time.

Compounding interest is a critically important factor to building wealth. It’s like rolling a snowball down a snowy hill. As it rolls downward it gains momentum and size. The longer the hill, the longer it has to grow in size, and larger it’ll be when it reaches bottom. You’ve got to do the same with your investing. Starting early is key to building wealth.

3. Build your own company, not someone else’s

Millionaires know that to become truly financially successful you’ve got to build your wealth, not someone else’s. This starts by building your own company. When you work for someone else, you’re building a company that you have zero equity in. There will come a day when the owners of the business can sell it for millions, while you’ll still be left working in your cube counting down the days until you hit 65.

Building wealth means putting yourself on the other side of the equation. Instead of growing someone else’s company, invest in your own company that you’ll eventually be able to sell when your working days are over.

4. Invest in appreciating assets

While you used last year’s annual bonus to buy a new new car, or go on a shopping spree the financially smart were saving up to invest in a second home. They bought assets that appreciate in value while you bought depreciating assets. In 5 or 10 years they’ll be able to turn around and sell their property for more than they bought it, while you’re car will be worth pennies on the dollar of what you bought it.

When you have some extra money to spend ask yourself if what you want to buy will be worth more or less in 5 or 10 years. Asking yourself this question will lead you to invest in things that you can enjoy today, and that you’ll be able to sell later for more money than you bought it.

5. Seek knowledge

Finally, one of the most powerful secrets of the wealthy is that they consistently seek out new knowledge.

The great thing about becoming wealthy is that it’s not like trying to play basketball in the NBA. It’s not based on height, coordination, or any physical God given ability outside of your control.

The opportunity to build wealth isn’t something given only to a certain subset of the population. Everyone has the opportunity to become wealthy, and there are nearly a million ways to become a millionaire.

It all starts with knowledge, which is the building block of every successful person out there. It’s as simple as that, and anyone can seek to attain it whether through books or real life experience.

If you want to become the next millionaire added to the list it’s completely up to you. Only you can make it happen, so go do it!",1

Furthermore NFLX is no longer simply takes other peoples content and streams it as it makes its own content such as House of Cards and Orange is the New Black, making it like HBO as well as Hulu.",0

To trade something like CL, I need about $3K intraday initial, and $2.5K intraday maintenance. So I believe that would mean I need to have $5.5K in my account to trade one contract. (terrible risk management, I know.)

Now lets say I have $30K to play with. Can i in theory afford $30k / $5.5K = so 5 contracts total? Same with something like GC, its $3.7K + 3K = $6.7K, meaning I can only afford  4 contracts if my account balance is $30K?

At what point would the broker close me out of trades? Lets say I have 5 CL contracts long, and it drops $5 on me, meaning a $25K loss, would they wait until it wipes out my account in full, or take me out immediately because I basically have no maintenance margin anymore? 

This is all for my general understanding, I dont actually intend to lose my IRA trading futures.

USing YF you can get a lot of information - yield, earnings date etc etc but you have to use a script. I did some digging around and here are the commands - you can build a pretty good portfolio tool with this:

The default seems to be around once a year, but if you have a target date fund, the asset allocation doesn't change at all until you hit the tapering phase in which the stock allocation goes down. Does that make sense? Or is it more of an easy, no-brainer but sub-optimal approach?

On the other end of the spectrum, market conditions can change over time (and not on any annual schedule) so wouldn't it make sense to update more frequently (say every 3 or 6 months or when something in the market changes)? If so, what do people look at to change their mix?",0

The current share price at the end of trading Friday on AET was 125.51 x 0.8375 = $104.17 worth of Aetna stock + $125 cash means they value Humana at $229. Humana's current stock price is 187.50.

15-07-05,3c5yi8,Great video on contrarian trading strategies and why the market often does the opposite of what amateur traders expect,"Hey all,

This is a great video a buddy of mine, Tim Parker, who is a fantastic contrarian trader posted recently about how sentiment drives everything in the stock market and the reasons the market often does the opposite of what you might expect as a newer trader. I thought it was a great explanation of how the ""herd mentality"" works and why new traders (and the all-too-common experienced traders who are somehow still part of the herd) often find themselves holding a losing position after the same scenario plays out so many times that it no longer works because everyone believes in it. 

You may have to watch a few times to sort it out mentally because the idea is quite counter-intuitive. IMO to get the most out of the video you should try to stay away from battling the idea that ""Greece doesn't matter to the market"" (as this is just an example sentiment for the sake of argument) and focus instead on just assuming that this is a true statement in order to understand the logic. If you believe the opposite then the same logic can be applied in the opposite direction so it doesn't really matter what you believe, just so long as you understand the reasoning. I personally thought the example in the end was easier to understand than the Greece example. In the last example you have a worthless pig stock that keeps squeezing on some fluff news piece despite the fact that everyone knows it's garbage, until such time as it has squeezed so much that people have forgotten it's a junk stock and now everyone believes it's a high quality stock. Everyone now thinks it's a good buy and they start to doubt the true nature of the stock, after which the natural outcome of its worthless nature is allowed to play out. 

Feel free to disagree/discuss/add insight/ask questions. I had a quick follow up Skype call with him after he posted it to help my own understanding so I'll do my best to answer or relay questions to him if I can't answer them myself!

15-07-05,3c6ri4,Reconciling operating income and net income on the income statement (TSE:ETX),"I'm doing some research into [Etrion (TSE:ETX)](https://www.google.com/finance?q=TSE%3AETX&amp;fstype=ii&amp;ei=rAqZVeG7NYyCsAHZ-aroAg), and got very confused looking at their numbers, specifically how their ""net income"" is calculated. There's a huge discrepancy between their operating income and EBIT. For example, in the 2014-06-30 column, they went from $8.94M in operating income to $0.81M EBIT and ultimately $-1.42 net income.

Should I consider this a huge red flag that they're cooking the books? Or is there some other publically available information that is part of this equation?",1
15-07-05,3c6rm0,If you expect a very steep rise on the opening of a stock can you earn on it?,"My hypothetical scenario: Greece votes yes and will trigger a sharp rise in European stocks monday. I buy European stocks today. If the market closed friday at a certain number and stocks rise like 3% monday on the opening, can I earn the full 3% on those stocks? Zooming in on a graph it looks like a stock can close on a friday and open 3% higher on a monday without rising during trading hours making earning those 3% impossible.

This example happened last weekend: http://i.imgur.com/i0iUCiA.png It closed above 11500 friday and dropped (or opened) below 11000 monday morning. If I had bought between friday's close and monday's opening, would I have lost those 500 points? The steep downward line should not be there if this were not the case, right?

So how does this work?",0

* How old are you?
* Are you employed/making income? How much?
* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)
* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)
* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
* Any big debts?
* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.

This has worked well in the last 5 years because the market has generally gone up.

It seems this strategy is sound, but not immune to market crashes that will regularly decimate the value of the portfolio, until the market goes back up.

What I'm wondering is, does anyone have any strategies to anticipate market crashes. What signals would you look at ?",0

15-07-05,3c6buk,Locking in your profit rather than just blindly buy and hold,"Why is active investing viewed very negatively.

Logically, it makes a lot of sense to actively manage your investment and lock in the profit rather than just buy and hold.

Suppose you invest in XYZ stock/ETF in January of some year and after 4 months, your portfolio has gained 30% and then in August, it is back to where it started at 0% gain due to some issues like war/disaster/news etc. Wouldn't it be a good idea to sell when you are up 30% and buy when the market is down in August or just buy a different stock/ETF?

It seems to me like ""buy and hold"" contradicts the tried and tested method of ""buy low and sell high"".

I know I will get a lot of hate from the Vanguard buy and hold lovers, but please explain to me why my thinking is wrong instead of just saying that it is wrong.",1

15-07-05,3c8s3e,Need serious advice on holdings in oil companies DO and RIG?,"Parents have a large percentage of assets in RIG and DO (millions) probably some on margin too. What are future prospects? Is selling and being in cash wise given how low the stocks are now/ how grim oil is looking? They aren't active traders haven't looked at portfolio in a LONG time. 

Personally I believe that the market is inflated, and bad global news is really going hit hard in the coming months. I also believe in the philosophy that if you wouldn't buy the stock right now, don't hold it.
I don't know too much about these oil companies or the industry in general. Can anyone spare some advice?  

I am pretty upset with how stupid they are, but my care level is almost nothing because I am going to be starting my independent life pretty soon and I don't need their money to do well. ",1

I'm cases in which a firm does not pay a dividend and will not be liquidated, why does it matter to shareholders\investors if a company they have ""partial ownership"" over makes or has more assets? I know that if the firm makes more money, the share price will go up and then you can sell it and profit. But is this correlation just a kind of gentleman's agreement, or out of a hope that a stock will pay a dividend or get liquidated?

15-07-06,3c8wyh,How Should I Profit off the Collapse of the Euro?,"We're entering a phase of municipal and sovereign defaults that have just begun. Puerto Rico and Greece are the first dominoes to fall. Since Grexit is becoming more of a reality, there is already attention towards Italy and Spain. They now have a precedent to demand better terms from their creditors as Greece just did. This will lead to the rise in nationalism and separatism. 

What rational person would keep his capital in this currency? It's based off a union of nations that are now crying to get out, and being punished for daring to do so (capital controls). Any investor looking at this situation is going to balk, at least until the situation stabilizes. There is nothing stable about the Euro now. 

Poland and the UK were smart to stay out. Let's put it this way: I do not see any compelling reason for any nation to enter the Euro bloc. It seems more plausible that we will see Italy and Spain have a referendum within 2 years' time, which lines up nicely with the already planned UK referendum.

So that being said, how do I make profit?

I'm buying puts on MBIA and Assured Guaranty. I don't have a forex account, but I'm wondering if there's an inverse Euro ETF out there. 

I'm also hedging into RMB. Just had a Chinese guy come here and we swapped briefcases of cash. The peg isn't going to last forever, and if it does I simply get back the cash I put in, albeit with no returns, but at the moment it seems like a risk-less investment. 

Either the Chinese keep the peg, or they lower it. It's not even remotely conceivable for the Chinese government to suppress their currency value even further by devaluation. They already have the balance of trade in their favor. 

That's what I'm doing. I also bought Corn futures...looks like it's going to be a cold winter. Food shortages with broke governments is not a scenario that looks to have a favorable socio-economic outcome.

What else should I be doing? Am I wrong with my assessments? What are your hedge plans? My CFA told me to avoid Munis like the plague, hence the MBIA and AGO puts.

15-07-06,3c8y1v,NBG,I bought around 110 Shares of NBG for $1.12. I am new when it comes to stock trading so I was wondering if I should sell or keep the shares because of the NO vote in the referendum today. Thanks  ,5
15-07-05,3c79nw,Stock Spinoffs,"Working with inherited stock here so forgive me for not knowing all of the in's an outs.  

Last week NiSource (NYSE:NI) spun off Columbia Pipeline Group (NYSE:CPGX).  On July 2nd, the current NI share holders received 1 share of CPGX for each NI share they owned on June 19th.  On June 22nd, NI reached a near 52 week high of almost $49 per share.  

I am a NI shareholder.  What was to keep me from selling on the 22nd at $49 per share, and still receiving the $30 per share of CPGX I got last week effectively automatically making $30 per share overnight?

Am I missing something?  Is this legal?  If I'm not missing anything and it is legal, is it possible to cash in in the same way with the upcoming Ebay/Paypal spinoff who's ""ex"" day is the 8th? Thanks!",1

In an interview with NPR soon after the launch of his latest Pixar megahit, Inside Out, writer/director Pete Docter said he found it “kind of baffling” that scientists have yet to come to a consensus on how many emotions jockey for attention in the human brain.
“Some guys would say, well, there’s three basic emotions, and then someone else would tell us there’s 27 basic emotions. And we’re like, what?”

The film’s entire premise hangs on an exploration of the mental events of the film’s saucer-eyed 11-year-old protagonist, Riley Anderson. So Docter needed to pick a number. In the end, he settled on five of these so-called “basic” or fundamental emotions — joy, fear, disgust, anger and sadness — each anthropomorphized as celebrity-voiced animated characters. (Amy Poehler as Joy has drawn the most positive review ink, but The Office’s Phyllis Smith is exemplary as Sadness, whose chief coping strategy is to swoon onto the floor into a state of lamentation.)",1

I had an informational interview with an investment banker (boutique), a few months ago as part of a course I was in. At the time I had no particular desire to go into finance, but he was a very convincing interviewee.
My background is in bio research, and a few engineering startups. I openly said that I didn't expect a future in the finance field to to my background, but he was adamant that this would be a non issue (he listed qualities he'd want someone to be: interesting, intelligent, outgoing, writing skills...). Since then I've been looking into every avenue available for me to make the switch.

As I near my graduation, I want to put in an application to this banker, and I'm wondering what sort of things I should work on, include, and make a project of to best get me into IBanking.

I have read several analysts discuss the fact that Netflix's share price is overpriced, yet it has continued to rise in price for years. I am interested in buying it now. 

When AAPL decided to split, I bought it because I concluded that the more attractive price would attract more investors. Although the two companies are different in many senses, I think I see a pattern between the two splits.

Bought AAPL around 99$ and sold around 137$
I would be thrilled if I could do the same for NFLX.

Additionally, I would argue that when and if GOOG splits, it will see a rise in share price as a result of a more attractive price.

What do you think you will do? What do you think other investors will do? Calling all bears and bulls, I want to hear your arguments and counter-arguments!

Thank you fellow US investors.

I came across this situation a few times today, and feel I must be missing something here.

I have yet to begin investing and am currently educating myself. Thank you for your enlightenment!",5

I invested ~5 months ago on the thesis that valuations in Europe were more attractive than the in the US. Obviously, things haven't gone so well since then, with today's news on the referendum punctuating what's been a painful last month or two.

I'm now down ~4.5% on HEDJ and ~2.0% on VGK. I'd like some thoughts - is now the time to cut my losses and reposition? Or do I ride it out? Time isn't an issue as I won't be retiring for quite some time.

To get past paywall, [click on link from google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=China%E2%80%99s+Hunger+for+Robots+Marks+Significant+Shift&amp;oq=China%E2%80%99s+Hunger+for+Robots+Marks+Significant+Shift&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60.885j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=UTF-8).

There was some discussion in another thread last week about China's use of robots, WSJ reported on it over the weekend.

Some interesting points:

""China already ranks as the world’s largest market for robotic machines. Sales last year grew 54% from a year earlier, and the boom shows every sign of increasing. China is projected to have more installed industrial robots than any other country by next year, according to the International Federation of Robotics.""

""One reason China will continue booming is because it has relatively low “robot density,” the trade group says. China has about 30 robots for every 10,000 factory workers. In Germany, the density is 10 times that amount.""

""Meanwhile, there is little evidence so far that robots are having a big impact on employment. Average urban wages in China rose more than 10% in 2014, even as the country remains on target to create at least 10 million new jobs this year.""",2
15-07-06,3cb3j8,"CBI - The long game &amp; short gamble","I'm invested in CBI as a long term, undervalued stock.  Its one of Rupert Murdoch's holdings. Chase believes it's undervalued with a $65 target.  It's currently trading ~48-49.   The fundamentals are solid.   There's a nuclear delay issue pending and whether their partner westinghouse will have to shoulder that burden.   They recently announced ~225 million in new contracts.   Their annual report on the 23rd should be positive given the new contracts and the belief that westinghouse will shoulder the nuclear delays.

Until the 23rd there is downward selling pressure and there are around 150,000 shorts on the July 17th.

I'm not recommending calls or puts, but I'll leave it here that there's considerable downward pressure on CBI until the 17th and the possibility of very good news the 23rd.

15-07-06,3cb3mc,Getting into day trading?,"Hello all,

I'm not sure if this is the best sub for this, but I am considering getting into a day trading (anything: forex, equities, whatever). I honestly have no idea where to even begin (read ebooks?), so any tips, suggestions, etc. would be greatly appreciated. 

I have some money (apprx $20,000) of which I might use all or some for day trading once I feel that I am ready. I have no idea what else to do with my money. I considered real estate but where I live everything is too god damn expensive and a correction will likely come. I have some of my money invested in equities but I feel that the equities market is also due for a significant correction. 

Also, I think that by day trading I will be forced to keep up with details of current financial news/data which will help me as I eventually want to shift careers into the financial industry. ",3

15-07-06,3cb9cg,Fixed Income Analysis,"I am interested in learning more about fixed income and ultimately seeking a position as a fixed income analyst.  A little about me: I work at the trading desk of an introducing firm.  I have passed my series 7 and will soon be taking the series 24; I know these tests just break the ice on what I will need in order to pursue my desired career; but i feel like they are a good start.  

Here are a few questions that I have pertaining to fixed income, any insight on this matter will be greatly appreciated.

1. Besides a fundamental understanding of fixed income, what are important qualifications to consider when seeking a career in fixed income?  I have the opportunity to attend graduate school on my current employer's dime so furthering my education is a possibility.

2.  What types of jobs will put me in a good position to learn what I need to know and set me up for a promotion to my ultimate goal? 

3.  Any other suggestions for getting myself acclimated with the area of expertise would be greatly appreciated. 

  If anyone has experience specifically related to this subject (i.e. you are a fixed income analyst) I would be very interested in communicating in a more personal and professional manner (such as email) if you are comfortable doing so.  ",19

15-07-06,3cbjzr,Vacation Rental Income - Am I missing something?,"Ok guys, brief background. I'm moving from NOLA to Nashville this week (Thank God, New Orleans is a disgusting, vile trash heap) and have been looking at vacation homes in the Smokies (Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, etc...) like cabins with strong rental histories (overnight rentals, not long term)

I know overnight management fees are much different, and maintenance is much higher due to turnover, etc... but most of these properties bring in strong rental income between 30K-50K per year.

So I made this worksheet to help me see what the scenario would look like based on rental income in these ranges. All I have to put in is the house sale value, rental income average, and the number of years I would own it. I know there are some holes (like depreciation not applying after 27.5 years etc...) but there are also things that could increase earnings (like mortgage interest going down each year etc...) I have also accounted for upgrades (based on the number of years of ownership etc...)

Short story long, after about 10 years of ownership, the annualized return (on the far right) seems to be really high. Does this look like a good place to stick 50K (down payment)?

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vuDLNAfrN4-RVtaOW3gD4dLe8lzxZ3hbXuEuJatKD9M/edit?usp=sharing] (Does this worksheet look complete) or am I missing something big?

Obviously I don't want a single rental property to be half of my investment assets unless I am really damn sure it's going to make me money, but it seems like it could be really good income if I stick it out any more than 5-10 years.

Anybody care to check it over and tell me what I'm missing? 26% annualized return seems like a far reach otherwise more people would be on this boat... Is it because it's so highly leveraged? This would mean on a bad year (rental income equaling less than expenses) my losses would be magnified correct?

EDIT: The worksheet is view only but you should be able to copy a version to your own Drive and play with the numbers. As you can see the first few years would be a loss if I sold too soon but it's interesting to see the increase in return after the 4-5 year mark when selling costs don't put me in the red.",34
15-07-06,3cbk8f,Thoughts on Micron?,"So I bought Micron in 2014 @ $32.07. It has been dropping steadily and while there most recent 10Q's do not look to great, I attribute a lot of it to weak PC demand (not that I am an expert or anything in the field but it seems like a very volatile market) and am long MU. But what do you guys think of Micron as a long term investment?",9
15-07-06,3cbkgi,Low Volatility Option Plays?,"I've been looking for some potential plays this week, generally I just sell strangles on range bound stocks, but I'm looking at going long some options that could be poised for a potential breakout and give myself a little more upside potential. Obviously I understand the risk going long simple strategies but I wanted to see what some of your opinions are. 

Big one I was looking at was either the weekly or the July 17 126 strike calls on AAPL. Looks like a volatility crunch on Apple as of late, I like the liquidity of Apple options and I think it could be poised for a bit of a move. Granted these are out of the money as of now, premium at .92

Anyways, thoughts on the weeklies versus the Jul 17s? Any other stocks you'd look at for going long option contracts? Not too keen on looking at multi-leg strategies at the moment since I'm not wanting to tie up too much of my buying power. ",8

I just began contributing to the Thrift Saving Plan, an IRA, last year and am currently putting the max I can into that every year to catch up a bit, which is $17,000 or so.

I feel like this should give me a net benefit (assuming the stocks do recover as I hope) since I would still own the same number of stocks but at a much lower cost basis, and have the added benefit of a tax-loss to report, however it somehow feels 'wrong' to be selling stocks that are currently in the red.",4

15-07-06,3cbxlm,Near term price targets on WTI Oil?,"Went long DWTI, I normally don't touch the share market like a pussy vanguarder but as this 3x leveraged ETN has no options, I gave it a shot.

I like how this product can follow long trends despite the inherent decay it can experience, but it gives me a much longer time frame than options decay does.

In the past I've done options on SCO, a 2x oil bear etf but it has spreads wider than fsyolo's mom, so its a little scary.

And /CL options on futures haven't let me leverage up high, my broker didn't let me buy a lot of options, fucking SPAN margining system.

So here we go, what WTI price target in the next two months? I would like DWTI to hit $160 again which is achievable in consecutive large down days OR oil hitting $25 which is quite low and improbable at this point in time.",1

15-07-06,3cc0rk,"Almost a millionaire, but didn't discover r/investing until I had made my money. If I had listened to this sub I would still be under $100,000.","A couple of thoughts for the new investors (call me cynical).

No amount of arguing about a companies prospects on this subreddit or on other message boards is going to change the future or past performance of a company. 

Nobody is going to pick companies for you. You have to find them yourself. Most people will tell you are stupid for picking the companies you did. I picked them anyway.

You can invest in indexes AND invest in individual stocks. 

99.9% of people involved in finance really don't care if you get rich or not or meet your financial goals for retirement. Believe me, they lose no sleep over it. They just want their cut. Vig is not just a horrible name for your firstborn child. The blackjack dealer only hopes you win if you tip big. Same thing here. 

Professionals don't want you to join their club unless it is to do work they don't really want to do. Enjoy doing your spreadsheets and powerpoints monkeys. 

Dumb professionals think they have it figured out, the smart ones are worried they are going to get figured out and the truly capable fly private. 

The less you think about the market the better. All of your time should be devoted to the business operations of the actual company. Only glance at the ticker to see if the company you covet is being offered at a discount. 

If someone mentions risk adjusted returns I know they are also the type of people to measure their dick starting at the taint. 

If professionals come on this sub to mock retail investors and newbies, I know they were the dorks everyone hated in high school. Don't be that guy. 

Dividends are great. 

Resign yourself to the mindset that it is going to take 40-50 years to build wealth so you don't make stupid short sighted decisions. The casino is filled with oxygen tanks, believe me you are still going to want money when you are 65. 

Don't lose money. It is a terrible hole to dig yourself out of investing wise. 

Never depend on the kindness of strangers when it comes to money. The more you have saved, the better off your life can be.",46
15-07-06,3ccxag,Apple Music: Can It Move The Needle?,"
[Read the Article Here](http://prosperityactiveyield.tumblr.com/post/123405856688/apple-music-can-it-move-the-needle)

Quick Summary:

* Anticipating iOS users to be three times more likely to use Apple Music than Android users.

* Split between individual subscription and family subscription is 60/40

* Total annual revenue generated by smartphone subscribers to Apple Music: $8.52 Billion

* Total annual profit generated by smartphone subscribers to Apple Music: $2.25 Billion.

_______________________________________________


Apple (AAPL) launched Apple Music, a music streaming service that is competing directly with the likes of big industry hitters like Spotify and Pandora (P). I've been listening to it all week, and it took me less than an hour to realize that I prefer it to my previous streaming music provider, Spotify.

I'm not interested in reviewing the product, however. As an Apple shareholder, I'm interested in reviewing its impact to Apple's bottom line. So can Apple Music move the needle? Let's find out.

Similarly to my analysis of Netflix (NFLX), which you can read on my Tumblr site, as a subscription-based service, Apple's Apple Music is a very simple product to model. Apple Music comes in two subscription packages:


* $9.99 per month for individual subscriptions

* $14.99 per month for family subscriptions for up to six people


Now the only question is: How many subscribers of each package will Apple be able to hook? Let's start with the entire universe of people who could possibly use the service.

Who Can Use Apple Music?

The answer to this question is: seemingly anyone with access to an internet connection. iOS users, Mac users, PC users, and - eventually - Android (GOOG) (GOOGL) users will all be able to enjoy Apple Music as long as they have access to the latest version of iTunes.

[It has been estimated that, by the end of this year, more than 2 billion people will be using a smartphone.](http://www.idc.com/prodserv/smartphone-os-market-share.jsp)


As of the latest fiscal quarter, 96.3% of worldwide smartphones run either Android (78%) or iOS (18.3%) operating systems. Now we're left with 1.926 billion people capable of subscribing to Apple Music from a smartphone.

Assumptions:

* 1 out of every 10 iOS smartphone users subscribe to Apple Music
* 1 out of every 30 Android smartphone users subscribe to Apple Music
* Split between those using an individual subscription and those on a family subscription is 60/40
* Average number of people on family subscription is 3 [Average family size in developed countries is around 2.75](http://www.generatorresearch.com/tekcarta/databank/households-average-household-size/)


How the Numbers Play Out:

**iOS Smartphone Users:**

* Worldwide iOS smartphone users: 366 million

* Number of iOS smartphone users subscribing to Apple Music: 36.6 million

* Number of Apple Music iOS smartphone users with an individual subscription: 22 million

* Revenue generated by individual iOS Apple Music subscribers: $220 million/month, $2.64 billion/year

* Number of Apple Music iOS smartphone users with a family subscription: 14.6 million

* Number of iOS family subscribers to Apple Music paying for the subscription: 4.87 million

* Revenue generated by family iOS Apple Music subscribers: $73.05 million/month, $876.6 million/year


* **Total revenue generated by iOS Apple Music subscribers: $3.52 billion/year**

**Android Smartphone Users:**

* Worldwide Android smartphone users: 1.56 billion

* Number of Android smartphone users subscribing to Apple Music: 52 million

* Number of Apple Music Android smartphone users with an individual subscription: 31.2 million

* Revenue generated by individual Android Apple Music subscribers: $312 million/month, $3.75 billion/year

* Number of Apple Music Android smartphone users with a family subscription: 20.8 million

* Number of Android family subscribers to Apple Music paying for the subscription: 6.93 million

* Revenue generated by family Android Apple Music subscribers: $104 million/month, $1.25 billion/year

* **Total revenue generated by Android Apple Music subscribers: $5 billion/year**

**Total revenue generated by smartphone subscribers: $8.52 billion/year**

**Turning Revenues into Profits:**

[Apple has announced that it is paying artists 71.5% of all subscription revenues](http://www.macrumors.com/2015/06/15/apple-music-715-revenue-sharing-confirmed/). This leaves apple with 28.5%, or an estimated $2.5 billion/year. Between advertising and staffing, let's assume Apple spends $250 million/year running Apple Music. **This leaves Apple with $2.25 billion/year in profit from Apple Music alone.** Put another way, that would be an additional 4.5% to Apple's profits.

**Takeaway:**



With the potential to boost Apple's bottom line by 4.5%, the release of Apple Music certainly won't be a ""game changer"" for Apple. That said, $2.25 billion per year is undoubtedly an impressive figure. Investors have been calling for Apple to diversify its product range for many years now, and it seems as if Tim Cook has been *listening* (pardon the pun).

 Most people Don't trade what they know. For example, while trading oil, I can give great advice about large caps, Alibaba, Twitter, Gpro or other commodities like gold, a quick 2 cents on the issue. Those 2 cents turn out to be right for very long periods of time. But because oil is my focus. Bc I spent 6 months of charting and fundamental research focusing on oil, I fight not to change my correct analysis over time.
 While going through my investing related posts, all my advice on stuff I wasn't trading was straight money making advice. All the times where I HAD to comment on someone's investment post without having any intention of investing in said advice. While, at the same time, I under performed on my actual focus. This is just something I noticed when going back through my posts. Remember to take a step back, read your previous advice, and look to see where you were most accurate. You should find your accuracy in things you never overthink, because these are things you are not actively pursuing to trade. Trade what you know, not what you feel you have to trade because its in your comfort zone. Also, remember to reread your previous posts on whatever your focus. It will give great insight into how your thinking differed from Mr Market on that ticker at that time. Might just give you the perspective you need. If you feel this doesn't apply in any way, shape, or form, then you are either making money hand over fist, or you have no intention of changing your trading based off analysis of your previous trades and advice.

15-07-06,3cd1pr,My 2 min method of checking whether a bank stock is priced correctly,"**Starting Assumptions:** 

- The market overreacts to both, positive and negative news. While it eventually corrects itself, there is a period of time where one can pick up a bargain. 
- A **stable** bank's ability to make money is tied to the amount of equity on its books (the book value) and the return on equity it can generate
- Stable means, large market cap, growth similar to the economy in which it operates
- A stable bank's capital requirements change only in extreme circumstances and those cannot be foreseen with any actionable accuracy
- stable banks maintain their payout ratios in a narrow range, outside of abnormal events
- The expected growth rate in perpetuity for any bank is equal to the long term GDP growth of the economy in which the bank is operating. If you grow faster than the GDP forever, eventually you get to be the GDP, which is absurd (I almost always use 1% as a pessimistic assumption to find deep value)
- Excluding external risks (political, economic, social etc), a bank's leverage is the key driver of risk. more levered = higher risk

**The Math:**

P/BV = (ROE - g)/(r - g)

where:

- P/BV is the price to book value
- ROE is the return on equity in the last 12 months
- g is expected growth rate **in perpetuity**
- r is the minimum return investors want from the stock (cost of equity adjusted for risk)


**Implications:**

- If the P/BV on the market at any point is less than the P/BV as calculated by this method, the stock is **trading at a discount**, likewise, when P/BV is higher than the calculated P/BV, the stock is trading at a premium. 
- You want to buy when the market P/BV is less than the calculated P/BV and sell/not buy when the market P/BV is higher than calculated P/BV.

**Examples:**

*JP Morgan*

- ROE (ttm) = [9.84%](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=JPM)
- g = 1% (pessimistic assumption of GDP growth for countries in which JPM operates)
- r = 8.80% (8% coe adjusted for leverage that is higher than industry average)

Thus, the P/BV = (9.84% - 1%)/(8.8% - 1%) = 1.14

P/BV today is 1.17 indicating that the stock could be trading at an 2.59% premium to it's fair value. 

*Wells Fargo*

- ROE (ttm) = [12.78%](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=WFC%2C+&amp;ql=1)
- g = 1% (same for comparison purposes)
- r = 7.78% 

Thus, the P/BV = (12.78% - 1%)/(7.78% - 1%) = 1.74

P/BV today is 1.73 indicating that the stock could be trading at its fair value. 

**Caveats:**

- This is meant as a rough psuedo-valuation. If this turns up some stock that is trading at a ridiculous discount, do a deep dive, there might a good reason, or not. 
- Keep in mind that this assumes you are okay with the return the market will accept.  If your target is higher/lower, the stock maybe over/under its fair value
- This works well when the bank is stable and it's capital structure is not expected to change by much. new banks who have small or negative equity are not well served by this and deserve a full blown valuation


This is my method, and it's not meant as financial advice blah blah blah

15-07-06,3cd1r3,Investing for Beginners Part 2 – Different Investment Strategies,"Part 1 of this Investing for Beginners series is officially over – we’ve covered all the basic terminology. In Part 2 of this series, we’re going to be looking at the different investment strategies (and how each strategy works). Here’s a quick breakdown.

Buy and hold (the right way to do it – not the conventional way)
Secular investing (what some people might call “fundamental investing”)
Trend following
Contrarian investing
Discretionary investing (what some people might call “trading”. This term is actually a misnomer. I’ll explain why in later posts).
Short term trading.
As you can see, there is a pattern in this breakdown. The strategies go from longer term (eg. 20 year investment cycles) to shorter term (eg 5 months investment cycles). I’ll explain each of these six strategies in detail. However, in this post I’m going to explain exactly what investment strategy is right for you. But before I do that, let me tell you a little story.

There was once a guy called John Smith, born circa 1975. By the late 1990s, John had just graduated, had a serious girlfriend, got a job, wanted to settle down, and needed some extra cash (hey – no one ever said that relationships came cheap). What year was this? 1998, the top of the hot-dot-com (internet bubble)! He starts off as a day trader, because “he wants to make some extra money on the side”. The tech bubble bursts in 2000, and John says “I don’t want to be a day trader any more. I want to be a long term investor”. 2008 comes along, and John gets his head handed to him again in the financial markets. Seeing his horrific losses, John says to himself “I’ll be a buy and hold investor, just like Warren Buffett. I’ll hold onto my investments forever”.

I find this story to be very amusing, because it describes the exact story about how most investors chose their investment strategies – their external circumstances (aka market conditions) make them choose their strategy. Please don’t do that.

Your Personality
First and foremost – your personality is what determines your investment strategy. This is a pretty simple concept actually. There are 2 key aspects of your personality that are important here:

Your speed.
Your stomache.
Some people are slow. I don’t mean that to offend anyone – they just are (I remember my Gr. 3 teacher asking one of my peers “Gabriel, do you have any gear other than Slow?”). In fact, being slow isn’t a disadvantage when it comes to investing (slow is synonymous with patient). There are two types of people: fast people and slow people. Fast people need thrill and excitement in their life. They just can’t sit on their butts and watch money slowly come in. They have to feel as if they’re doing something all the time. For these people, buy and hold definitely will not work. Trading is suitable to them – if you can’t even hold onto an investment for a year, how are you supposed to “buy and hold it” for 20 years? Impossible!

Some people are risk-takers, while others like to avoid risk. Personally, I admire a life like Steve Jobs’ – a roller coaster. I can’t stand low volatility in the markets. I need a heavily volatile market to remain comfortable. Your ability to take risk and withstand volatility (how much the market fluctuates) will determine what investment strategy is right for you.

Your Time
I get it – life is busy, maybe you’ve got the young family, 2 kids, a-hole of a boss. Your time will impact your investment strategy. That’s a no-brainer. The less time you have, the longer term of an investment strategy you’ll need to take.

But here’s what I want you to remember. Below a certain level of commitment (eg 2 hours a week), you shouldn’t be investing. Investing – like any other occupation, career, part time job, etc – is all about commitment. If you can’t even commit an hour each week to learning about investing and keeping abreast of the financial markets, you shouldn’t be investing! Stick your money into a bond or a bank or something!

The financial markets are a zero sum game. For every dollar made there’s a dollar lost. If you’re the house league guy playing against a triple A hockey player, can you win? Of course not! If you don’t even have a decent amount of commitment to investing, all you’re doing is giving money to guys like Warren Buffett who will make money!

Your Money
Last but not least, the amount of money you have will influence what type of investment strategy you should pursue. If you just have $20,000 I’m sorry to break it to you. Buy and hold just won’t work. A person with $1 million only needs to make 10% a year to make $100k, while a person with $100k will need to make 100% a year to make $100k.

This being said, it’s pretty obvious what I’m hinting at – the less money you have (“startup” capital), the more actively you’ll need to invest and pursue superior investment returns.",1

Briefly, I'm investing in ETFs which track the price of commodities (I don't have the money to get into futures) our civilization needs, and which are becoming more and more scarce (and therefore more expensive in real terms). 

I have invested, for example, in lithium - a key ingredient in batteries for the foreseeable future, and an element which does not exist in minable quantities in very many places on earth. I have invested in oil, because despite a temporary glut of new supply from fracking, the EROEI of oil continues to decrease, which raises the price (probably in cycles as increasing prices make exotic extraction methods cost effective which saturate the market causing a crash - repeat as necessary). I have a few more things - some specific rare earth elements, a long shot in thorium, etc. 

Anyway, I read the guidelines, and I'm not really asking for advice. I'm just wondering if this approach (ie looking at the limiting elements necessary for modern technology to function and investing in an ETF which roughly tracks their price) is completely wrong for some fundamental reason I don't understand.

15-07-06,3cceos,Ronin Game Studios Launches New Life Simulation Game Battle for Wall Street on iOS and Android,"Ronin Game Studios, LLC, the leading provider of Wall Street themed entertainment games, just announced the launch of Battle for Wall Street, a unique Wall Street themed life simulation game and corresponding mobile application. Battle for Wall Street will take users on an unpredictable journey as they try their luck at becoming the next Titan of Wall Street.

To download the game, visit http://www.roningamestudios.com/battle-for-wall-street/

Battle for Wall Street allows players to start their own virtual trading firm, which requires everything from constructing the trading floors and purchasing coffee to hiring and managing the day-traders. As the game incorporates real-time stock market data, players are subject to the ups and downs of the market and will experience the peaks and pitfalls any business leader does.

“Battle for Wall Street is an entertainment platform that allows users to experience the thrills of Wall Street right at their fingertips,” said Harry Temkin, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Ronin Games Studios. “Players will learn how to manage their own firm and employees while following the stock-market in real time.”

Players will begin the game on the lowest trading floor with only two day traders and 50 gold bouillons. Players can then advance through the game by completing different missions and/or making in-app purchases. Through these two options, players can improve the mood of their day traders, make upgrades to their space, move-up floors in the office, and hire more day traders. A large focus of the game is maintaining a day trader’s positive mood, which will result in better trading performance during exchange battles. Day traders with poor moods will perform poorly and eventually quit. Moods can be improved through a variety of ways such as brewing coffee, preparing meals or playing the trading floor jukebox.

“We recognized the popularity of life simulation games and wanted to bring that into an environment as exciting as Wall Street,” stated Stephen Kalayjian, Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer of Ronin Game Studios.

Battle for Wall Street is available to play on a mobile device or tablet. The game is free to download, though in-app purchases will help maximize player potential and increase the chances of winning the Battle for Wall Street. The game is available for download for both Android and Apple platforms through Google Play and iTunes.",0

Is anyone long with me? I hear news of HUGE buybacks, a possible buyout, a spinoff, new products, and the price continues to drop. At these prices, QCOM is now a dividend machine. It also has one of the most attractive balance sheets out there, and around $5 per share in cash! Because of my layers, I have gotten very heavy in this position. ",26

15-07-07,3cda6u,Looking for Dot-Com Bubble Details,"Hey guys,

           I have been learning about the dot-com bubble and all the specifics about how it happened what triggered certain events, but other than maybe a technical analysis of resistance at 5,000 cap of the NASDAQ I can not for the life of me find other reasons it crashed at that specific point, no news articles or anything on JSTOR and the like.

          Also Later, there was a base at 3321.29 on April 14th 2000 and almost two identical peaks on July 14th at 4246.18 and September 1st at 4234.33. But again I can't find any relevant information regarding these points of significance that would lead to these immediate drops and gains other than arbitrary investor sentiment.

          If anyone has any idea where I can find more resources other than where I have been looking, please let me know. Thanks!",2

15-07-06,3cchww,[Discussion] What do you think is the future of AMD?,"AMD has lowered its revenue estimate for the second quarter ended June 27. The forecast was 3%, plus or minus 3% lower compared to Q1 and it is now 8% lower.
AMD is down 15% in after-hours. Making it the lowest point since November 2012.

That the PC market is declining should not be a surprise. People and companies are waiting for Windows 10. Smartphones and tablets have taken become more common and have taken over the basic tasks such as visiting a website, checking your mail, social media and communication.
On top of that, PC hardware has been strong enough for the past few years. A PC bought in 2010 is still capable of running all the daily tasks for most people. 

INTC has crushed AMD in terms of CPU. The advantage of AMD was bang for bucks, but it is no longer with PC’s. With laptops and tablets AMD has nothing competitive. 

The low-margin gaming market has not been great and the GPU market has suffered due to lesser demand.

So what is the future of AMD? They don’t have as much money as NVDA or INTC to invest in R&amp;D. Due to patent deals; it will not be easy for them to sell the company, unless they split it and only sell the GPU part. 

What do you think their options are going forward?


*Disclaimer: I do not own any AMD stock and am not asking or providing any buy/sell advice. It is interesting to see the development and how and if it can be turned around.*

Sorry guys but my watchlists haven't been that amazing. Most of the stocks I am have been putting on my watchlists gap down and consolidate all day. ETF's are the only things I see worth trading ATM and I am not actually trading them. It will be interesting to see how the market is when more stocks small cap stocks pick up action.

-

Signal Genetics, Inc. **(SGNL)** is hovering right near the 3 month HOD's. This stock is a big former runner and has been slowly grinding up toward it. The key thing will be if it is able to break 3 or not. Will keep on watch until it gets to that point and will look for either a parabolic move over 3 or a stuff into that mark and a fade. Be very careful as this could easily fakeout then squeeze a lot of shorts through 3 (wait for higher lows to be safe).
 

6D Global Technologies, Inc. **(SIXD)** is a bit thin. Looking for the fade down to the low 9's some time intraday.


PDI, Inc. **(PDII)** has ran a bit in the past but hasn't actually lasted long. Looking closely at that 2 mark to ideally see it retest and stuff chasing longs. This is a tricky play so I suggest not making it unless you have a good r/r.

 Pharmaceuticals Inc. **(ENZN)** consolidated all day. Looking for a ramp back to the previous HOD's.

The books I've read are:

* [**Intelligent Investor** - Benjamin Graham](http://www.amazon.com/Intelligent-Investor-Definitive-Investing-Essentials/dp/0060555661/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436287384&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=intelligent+investor)

 This was my first book and it teaches all the fundamentals of value investing.  Very userful, and I am happy I started here.  Some of the numbers may be a bit stale.

* [**Interpretation of Financial Statements** - Benjamin Graham](http://www.amazon.com/Interpretation-Financial-Statements-Benjamin-Graham/dp/0887309135/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436287445&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=interpretation+of+financial+statements)

* [**Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits and Other Writings** - Philip A. Fisher](http://www.amazon.com/Common-Stocks-Uncommon-Profits-Writings/dp/0471445509/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436287471&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Common+stocks+and+Uncommon+profits)

 This is a growth investing book with a focus on picking good management.

* [**One Up On Wall Street: How To Use What You Already Know To Make Money In The Market** - Peter Lynch](http://www.amazon.com/One-Up-Wall-Street-Already/dp/0743200403/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436287534&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=One+up+on+wall+street)

 This was an easy and fun read.  You and your friends already know great products, so use that information when you invest.  Listen to those around you for accidental stock tips.  Buy as many stocks as you can too.

* [**The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind** - Gustave Le Bon](http://www.amazon.com/Crowd-Study-Popular-Mind/dp/0486419568/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436287606&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+crowd+a+study+of+the+popular+mind+by+gustave+lebon)

 Not exactly an investing book, but more about the psychology of people in crowds.  It's short and was written just after the French Revolution.  I found it useful from a ""don't panic"" and ""don't chase the crowd"" perspective.

* [**The Prince** - Niccolo Machiavelli](http://www.amazon.com/Prince-Dover-Thrift-Editions/dp/0486272745/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436287648&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+Prince)

 More of a business book and has good advice for leadership.  This may be helpful in teaching what to look for in good management.

* [**The Little Book That Still Beats the Market** - Joel Greenblatt](http://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Still-Beats-Market/dp/0470624159/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436287691&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+little+book+that+beats+the+market)
 
* [**Common Sense on Mutual Funds** - John C. Bogle](http://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Mutual-Funds-Anniversary/dp/0470138130/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436287775&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Common+Sense+on+Mutual+Funds)

 This book talked me out of picking my own stocks for a long time.  It's a thoroughly researched textbook about why most people don't beat the market.

* [**The Warren Buffet Way** - Robert G. Hagstrom](http://www.amazon.com/Warren-Buffett-Way-Website/dp/1118503252/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436288127&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+Warren+Buffet+Way)

* [**The Guru Investor: How to Beat the Market Using History's Best Investment Strategies** - John Reese](http://www.amazon.com/Guru-Investor-Historys-Investment-Strategies/dp/0470377097/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436287804&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Guru+Investor)

 This book summarizes the strategies of several famous investors.  It's a high level overview, and may be a good place to begin looking for a ""style"" of investing that suits you.  I didn't really like it that much.

* [**Stocks for the Long Run** - Jeremy J. Siegel](http://www.amazon.com/Stocks-Long-Run-Definitive-Investment/dp/0071800514/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436287841&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Stocks+for+the+long+run)

 Honestly, I don't even remember this book.  I think it was probably really boring.

* [**Economix** - Goodwin](http://www.amazon.com/Economix-Economy-Works-Doesnt-Pictures/dp/0810988399/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436287888&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=economix)

 A comic book about the economy.  It takes a historic look at how the economy has developed.  Kinda political towards the end.

* [**Rich Dad Poor Dad** - Robert Kiyosaki](http://www.amazon.com/Rich-Dad-Poor-Teach-Middle/dp/1612680011/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436287934&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=rich+dad+poor+dad)

 I was originally told to avoid this book because it was ""useless.""  I eventually got a copy cheaply, and I found it was a good book for teaching the attitude of investing.  It's not particularly useful for an intermediate or advanced investor.

* [**Contrarian Investment Strategies next generation** - David Dreman](http://www.amazon.com/Contrarian-Investment-Strategies-Psychological-Edge/dp/0743297962/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436287959&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=contrarian+investment+strategies+in+the+next+generation)

 The strategy of this book is to invest in a diverse set of low P/E stocks.  The idea, which he supports with tons of research, is that low P/E stocks have a higher response to good news and a lower response to negative news.  You get the opposite with high P/E stocks.

&amp;nbsp;

*To read:*

* [**Random walk down wall steret** - Burton Malkiel](http://www.amazon.com/Random-Walk-Down-Wall-Street/dp/0393246116/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436288009&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=random+walk+down+wall+street)
* [**Think and grow rich** - Napoleon Hill](http://www.amazon.com/Think-Grow-Rich-Landmark-Bestseller/dp/1585424331/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436288039&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Think+and+grow+rich)
* [**Security Analysis** - Benjamin Graham](http://www.amazon.com/Security-Analysis-Foreword-Buffett-Editions/dp/0071592539/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436288060&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=security+Analysis)

 Admitedly, I'm a bit intimidated by this book.

&amp;nbsp;

What books have you read and what should others read too? Did I miss a book that's the analog of The Intelligent Investor for your style of investing?",8

The question is, ""Do I have a God complex?"" which makes me wonder if this...”trader”, has any idea as to the kind of returns one has to receive in the market in order to be accepted into a top asset management firm? Or if you have the vaguest clue as to how talented someone has to be to lead a hedge fund? I have been long $YANG. I fought my board to be short $HLF and oil while being long $NFLX.  I have been awarded serious up-votes from seven different users on WSB and I never, ever cut my losses.  So I ask you; when /r/investing goes into the chapel and they fall on their knees and they pray to God that their wife’s healthcare ETF doesn’t implode or that their daughter’s vanguard mutual fund doesn’t bleed to death or that their mother doesn’t suffer excessive risk aversion from the ’08 shock, who do you think they are praying to? Now you go ahead and invest in the indexes  – /r/investing. And you go to your church and with any luck you might even make a pretty penny in the $NBG raffle. But if you’re looking for God, he was in a corner office at 200 West Street on July 7th, and he doesn’t like to be second guessed.  You ask me if I have a God complex?  Let me tell you something: I am God.

15-07-07,3cfy59,"UGEIF - Here's Why I Like It","Hope it's alright to post things like this?  I've been following a small solar company's stock for a while that has pretty low volume but also quite a low market cap with a ton of upside.  The company is UGE (UGEIF), the same company that installed wind turbines on the Eiffel Tower earlier this year.  Here's why I like it:
 - if you follow their investor newsletter you see that they've closed a ton of contracts so far this year, something like 2-3X all of last year
 - as we know, so many of these small cap stocks are more hype than substance, but UGE seems the opposite. If you look at their case studies the types of clients they work with are Hilton, Whole Foods, Philadelphia Eagles, Eiffel Tower.  You don't work with those types of companies if you don't have a good team.
 - the industry is growing extremely fast

15-07-07,3cfy8n,A London Hedge Fund Lost $1.2 Million in a Friday Afternoon Phone Scam,"This is like something from a movie. 

""The finance chief at Fortelus Capital Management LLP got an alarming phone call just as he was getting ready to leave work on a Friday.

The caller said he was from Coutts, the London-based hedge fund’s bank, and warned there may have been fraudulent activity on the account. Fortelus Chief Financial Officer Thomas Meston was reluctant, but agreed to use the bank’s smart card security system to generate codes for the caller to cancel 15 suspicious payments. He hung up just after 6 p.m., according to court filings. 

When Meston logged on to the firm’s online bank account the following Monday, he saw that 742,668 pounds ($1.2 million) was gone. Coutts, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, had no record of the Friday phone call. Meston had been conned.

The only reason I could fathom why insiders would hold a large short position going into the lockup would be to create an artificial short squeeze unloading their short positions thereby driving up the share price before selling off their long positions at a good price after lockup.

15-07-07,3ch65p,first job high-earner asking advice on saving/investing for a home,"29 yo resident alien with a PhD joining the workforce first time with roughly 265k (including expected bonuses stated in the contract) yearly salary for 3 years. I will be living with my partner whom I expect can make 6 figures upon graduating and joining me in NYC in about 6 months.

Some might be thinking ""why am I reading this, you've made it so GTFO!"" but I remind myself (and everyone) that the night is dark and full of terrors before rejoicing at the 6 figure salaries! I am starting my job in about 6 weeks and I want to devise a savings/investment plan for these 3 years. I unduly turned into r/investing community for advice. My PhD is in economics so spare me the sermons designated for the layperson, yet enlighten me about specific strategies and tools keeping in mind that I am not too familiar with USA laws and tax system etc.
 
Here is my financial situation: My net worth is low but luckily I don't have any student debt - I did undergrad in home country for free:). I started an IRA in my home country (both to hedge against the shit-goes-down-in-Murica risk and to enjoy a sweet 25% government subsidy) for a couple thousand dollars -- I kinda owe this sum to my parents though. My savings during grad school are pretty much emergency funds i.e. a couple thousand stacked in a money market account. I don't own or owe anything else. Pretty much a clean slate.

I want to buy a home as I want to start a family with my partner as soon as she graduates and joins the workforce. Buying a home in NY area is daunting task. In saving rent vs. living in a quality place trade-off, we went for a place 50% cheaper than what I could personally afford, up to 100% cheaper than we can jointly afford. We locked in for 2 years assuming we cannot buy earlier than that. We are also returning the leased car to avoid additional expenses.
  
My question has three parts:

1- Is buying a home in NY area a sound financial strategy in the first place? 

I don't think we can afford a quality 3 br apartment/condo/whatever in Manhattan but New Jersey properties appear within reach and have a lower property tax. I am not a real estate expert, certainly not expert on anything New York-ish just yet, but the price differential between two sides of Hudson River smells like an arbitrage opportunity keeping 30 year mortgage horizon in mind.
 
I have read many posts here about the advantages of renting over owning. What advantage renting has for a family-minded person in NY? The rental market is hectic in NYC e.g. the broker I worked with mentioned 1% yearly turnover for rentals compared to the huge influx of people like me moving in the city, the leasing manager in my new place mentioned an expected 5% raise on average after 2 years...So I should expect my rents to steadily go up if I want to keep the same standard of living or I got to move further away several times in 30 years. How is this possible when you have kids and you need to stay within the school district?

2-How to invest the money saved for down payment? 

Currently I do not have a Vanguard or any similar brokerage account. (I have just become a resident alien for tax purposes in 2014. For example Vanguard does not allow you open an account if you are a non-resident alien.) What do you suggest for 2-3 year horizon, is fixed income to match the maturities to my horizon too conservative or should I go for mutual funds skewed towards bonds? Given the short horizon and rowdy global markets, I have cold feet for equity, what do you think? 

Another unconventional alternative I want to throw in is to invest in CDs in my home country where most banks happily take dollar deposits (no currency risk). This is almost 0% due to deposit insurance but low return (I imagine 2-3% tops still higher than interest rates in the USA). Way too conservative?

3- How about retirement savings?

I know I am lucky enough to save for both. My company has a standard 401k plan with 50% of 6% savings matching up to some limit on max contribution. Plus I mentioned an IRA at home with 25% government matching. I have calculated how much money needed to max them out: roughly 14k for company 401k and 5k for home IRA. That's 19k that could go towards down payment. Yet 7k free money from the company plus 1750 from home government forgone... It pains me as an economist to leave money on the table. What do you suggest? Should I max the retirement savings first and then save for down payment?

15-07-07,3cgbg6,Silver Wheaton (SLW) Down 11% today because the Canadian Revenue Agency wants to reassess their taxes between 2005-2010,"From its form 6k

(http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1323404/000095014215001634/eh1500945_ex9901.htm)


&gt;Vancouver, British Columbia – Silver Wheaton Corp. (“Silver Wheaton” or the “Company”) (TSX:SLW) (NYSE:SLW) announces that it has received a proposal letter dated July 6, 2015 (the “Proposal”) from the Canada Revenue Agency (the “CRA”) in which the CRA is proposing to reassess Silver Wheaton under various rules contained in the Income Tax Act (Canada).

&gt;The Proposal outlines CRA’s position that the transfer pricing provisions of the Income Tax Act (Canada) relating to income earned by our foreign subsidiaries outside of Canada should apply such that the income of Silver Wheaton subject to tax in Canada should be increased for the 2005 to 2010 taxation years (the “Relevant Taxation Years”) by approximately Cdn$715 million (US$567 million). The issuance of the Proposal does not require the Company to pay any amount to the CRA at this time.

&gt;Management believes that the Company has filed its tax returns and paid applicable taxes in compliance with Canadian tax law. Silver Wheaton intends to vigorously defend its tax filing positions and is now in the process of preparing its response to the Proposal.

&gt;“We remain confident in our business structure which we believe is consistent with that typically used by Canadian companies, including Canadian streaming companies, that have international operations,” said Randy Smallwood, President and Chief Executive Officer of Silver Wheaton.

&gt;“Generally a company is taxable in Canada on its income earned in Canada, while non- Canadian income earned by foreign subsidiaries is not subject to Canadian income tax. However, with this Proposal, the CRA is seeking to tax, within Canada, streaming income earned outside of Canada by our foreign subsidiaries related to mines located outside of Canada,” added Smallwood.

&gt;Failing a resolution at the Proposal stage, the CRA may proceed to issue notices of reassessment for one or more of the Relevant Taxation Years. If the CRA reassesses Silver Wheaton on the basis outlined in the Proposal, and assuming that Silver Wheaton would be assessed taxes on the foreign subsidiaries’ income on the same basis as its Canadian income, Silver Wheaton currently estimates on a preliminary basis that it would be subject to federal and provincial tax of approximately US$150 million in respect of the Relevant Taxation Years. The Proposal also indicates that the CRA is seeking to apply transfer pricing penalties of approximately Cdn$72 million (US$57 million) in respect of the Relevant Taxation Years. The Proposal does not indicate the amount of interest or other penalties in respect of the Relevant Taxation Years. Further, taxation years subsequent to 2010 remain open to audit by the CRA.

&gt;Should Silver Wheaton receive a notice of reassessment from the CRA based upon the Proposal, we intend to file a notice of objection within the required 90 day period provided under the Income Tax Act (Canada). In such a circumstance, Silver Wheaton would be required to pay 50% of the reassessed amount of tax, interest and penalties. This amount, plus interest, would be refunded if the Company were ultimately successful in challenging a reassessment. Any notice of objection would be reviewed by the CRA’s Appeals Division. Silver Wheaton also has the right to appeal directly to the Tax Court of Canada 91 days after the date of filing of any notice of objection.

&gt;The timing for the Proposal process, the CRA appeals process and/or court process (if necessary following the issuance by CRA of any notices of reassessment), is uncertain. Regardless of the timing, Silver Wheaton intends to vigorously defend its tax filing positions.

TLDR: The CRA wants to reassess the taxes between 2005-2010 by Cdn$715 million (US$567 million) due to SLW's foreign operations. SLW's management believes it had acted within boundaries of their tax code and will be fighting against this in court.

15-07-08,3cjcts,NASDAQ building stock settlement system on-top of Bitcoin.,"Was rather surprised to find no discussion related to this.

**Nasdaq Signals Confidence in Bitcoin, Not Just the Blockchain - American Banker**

&gt;Critics often pay Bitcoin a backhanded compliment by calling it the Napster of finance. The underlying technology may change how business is done, they say, but the system itself isn't long for this world.

&gt;Now the Nasdaq stock exchange is challenging that conventional wisdom by not only testing Bitcoin's much-vaunted blockchain technology, but doing so on the Bitcoin network.

&gt;Last week Nasdaq announced plans to use Bitcoin's blockchain – a real-time public ledger of transactions – with the exchange's private markets platform, designated for firms preparing for initial public offerings. **Users will be able to issue and transfer securities on the blockchain via the Open Assets protocol, which uses specific units of bitcoin as tokens to represent ownership of equity shares or other assets.** These tokens are referred to as ""colored coins."" If all goes well, Nasdaq may expand its use of blockchain technology to other businesses, including its central counterparty clearinghouses and central security depositories, according to a person familiar with the company's thinking.

Cont here - http://www.americanbanker.com/news/bank-technology/nasdaq-signals-confidence-in-bitcoin-not-just-the-blockchain-1074405-1.html

Having gone over some recent discussion related to Bitcoin recently in /r/investing I'm continually surprised to see people solely focusing on the currency aspect of Bitcoin when it is the least interesting part. Forget the unit of account, the implications of that are largely irrelevant until one understands the other aspects; namely the payment network yet more importantly that a Blockchain is an immutable ledger and hence settlement system. 

The unit of account on it's own is worthless. It is the use of the network for a variety of reasons which gives the underlying worth. Use cases are developing rapidly as is evident in NASDAQ building systems using Bitcoin's blockchain.

15-07-07,3chauc,Why I think GoPro could be the next Apple of our generation.,"Okay, so maybe not the next Apple! But definitely a bullish company that will make investors extremely happy within the next 10 years. Here are my reasons:

Back when Apple came out with iPods, I remember everyone wanting one because they were essentially the BEST music MP3 player you could get at the time. It was also very slick and stylish. That was pretty much one of the top 3 hottest holiday items to purchase around that time.

I see the same for GoPro cameras. While there are competitors out there with similar cameras (even at cheaper prices), GoPro definitely makes the best quality camera with the biggest brand name out there. They have that Apple'ish prestige to them within their industry.

GoPro just made a new smaller camera. Again, essentially the same product, just smaller. They are taking a page out of Apple's playbook. ""Here is the new iPod, but smaller....new colors...accessories...etc."" GoPro makes accessories, etc.

Remember when Apple released their iPhone. How revolutionary it was. Could we see something from GoPro with drones in the future to come? I think so. There are drones that will follow you via GPS (for snowboarders, surfers, dirtbike riders, etc). I think they will make an awesome GoPro camera + Drone combo (similar to the iPhone and all it's other products syncing together).

Now GoPro claims they are content company. Could we see them creating their own digital platform in the future where people will share their videos? Social Media for videos? I have something in mind but it's really hard to explain. When you go to YouTube you see a bunch of GoPro videos. Perhaps they eliminate YouTube and create an app like vimeo/snapchat where you can see all the GoPro videos you can simply upload?

They are getting into Virtual Reality. VR headsets are supposedly one of the hottest items this holiday season. So they are getting into drones and VR?

I can totally see myself buying someones video of them skydiving somewhere for my VR headset for $1 of an iTunes'ish GoPro store?

Anyone else share these same thoughts or concerns? ",0

Sure it could all be a coincidence, but I'm wondering that either another big scam might be revealed soon, or that this is connected to (so far) mild downturn in markets.  
The second scenario worries me because it might indicate banks were generating yields via leveraged exposure to the markets. If this is indeed the case, then what about the counterparties, given the size of these institutions' balance sheets?

15-07-08,3cjrza,What the Chinese are thinking about the stock market,"X post from /r/China

In China's [股市:贴吧](http://tieba.baidu.com/f?kw=%E8%82%A1%E5%B8%82&amp;ie=utf-8), a China's version of reddit(with Chinese characteristics), there exists a subreddit that is themed on and about China's stock market.  The way the Chinese think about stock market is totally different from us, and I think their point of views on a few topics are quite interesting:

1. Why are the stock market dropping?

c110972 says: Today, we reap what we sow yesterday.  Let's start with the investigation on margin trading.  In the past, when in bull market, margin trade investigation will at best create a single 10% mid-term drop. No matter what you do, even with stamp duty and super short sell, still we won't be able to create the drop like today.  China stock market is a super mutant.  Stock market value very high, dividend very low.  Most stock do not have investment value, everyone are speculating on rise and drops, no different from casinos. The only function of the stock market, is to allow companies to create gambling chips for people sell into the stock market for real cash, it doesn't matter what the chips are made out of.

For those who can read Chinese, you can see people's replies in [here](http://tieba.baidu.com/p/3877438965), most agree with him, however, pes2068 says other wise:

&gt; The country is busy with AIIB, China's stock market tanks, is this a coincidence? Of course not, it's the American and Japanese's fault! Every country are watching us, we must win this war on finance!  The index is the key, we win, AIIB can open successfully! Today the big companies are showing signs of weakness, oil, bank, insurance and broker firms are starting to protect their share prices, all the data shows that our country is very efficient at handling matters when the stock market crises happen, showing responsibility worthy of this great country! To be a children of Chinese we can deeply feel the love and bountifulness of this land.  When small time investors are under fire from the stock market crises, the regularities, broker firms, stock funds have joint hands to launch a unionized assault, protecting the share prices together. Central bank is giving stock broker liquidity support.  Do not fall before sun rise! Believe in the capability of the government in saving the stock market!  It is the Chinese government, with guts and capabilities, who will protect the small investors of our motherland time and time again.  Believe!

Sorry, I need to take a break to laugh, more translations coming

2. What are we gonna do when the stock market tanks?

winnie200 said:

&gt;Citizens of China need to unite together! To protect the chinese stocks is to protect yourself! Buy!

&gt;Instead of insulting you should unite, support china! The stock market crisis is going to affact everyone!

&gt;The next step of a financial crisis, not only investors and financial institutes will be the ones negatively affected.  A lot of physical will also be affected.  Domestic demand will decrease, finance shrivel, exchange rate stability goes away, currency depreciate, first we will have deflation, then we will have bad inflation, every industry goes bankrupt, like what happened to Thailand and Korea in 1997. If this happen, will civil unrest happen?  We can't imagine that.  Under this condition, our currency will no longer be any safe asset, we will have to accept a totally different lifestyle.

&gt;For the country, for yourself, everyone buy 100 shares!

The others do not quite agree.  For example, fly飞翔的番茄 told winnie200:

&gt;OP should sell every he has, including his house, to buy in the stock market.  If he doesn't, he is unpatriotic, nation traitor!

**Summary:**

* At 4 times FY16 EPS, everyone knows AAL is ""cheap"".

* Questions about DOJ investigation, capacity growth, and negative FX impact remain.

* Benefits of lower jet fuel prices have yet to be priced in.

 set out to try and value American Airlines given currency fluctuations, changes in jet fuel prices and capacity concerns. Ultimately, I wanted to know how each factor translates to earnings. According to my model, FX effects accounted for a 1.63% revenue hit (which results in a 5.28% hit to earnings) in FY2015. My estimated Year-over-Year fuel savings from FY2014 to FY2015 account for a $2.45 Billion boost to FY2015 earnings. This is an enormous 39% of net income.

Either way, my valuation for AAL stands at about $53.61 per share. This is below the average analyst target price of $56.89, but it still represents a 34% upside from today's $40.00 price.

Airlines have been previously plagued by capacity increases destroying profits in a largely commoditized industry with very little customer allegiance. We've been told things are different now - it certainly appears so.

15-07-08,3ck6hs,How can a company that earn money have a P/E of only 1.6 and P/B of only 0.5 ?,"I've invested in a company that produces poly-silicon for the solar industry. Namely Rec Silicon which is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange: http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?ticker=REC:NO 

When I look on the company numbers, it looks like an undiscovered gold mine. Especially production of poly-silicon for cash production cost of $10.7/kg. However as I've been a shareholder for several years now, at least one big investor should have discovered this gold mine too(if it is really a gold mine?).

If I compare Rec Silicon to other poly-silicon producers as Wacker Chemie or GCL I see a completely different P/E and P/B over how the shares are valued. The companies are maybe slightly different economically structured, but should it really be that different reflected in the share price?

Are there other factors? Does the market think the poly-silicon market is going to be doomed? Is the US-China trade dispute causing unnecessary fear? Or have I read the numbers wrong and the market expect the company to go bankrupt?",1

**EDIT** - For those interested, /u/upads translated the announcement to English, and it is posted below:

The Chinese version of SEC announced on 8th July, 2015, in order to maintain stability of the capital market, share holders, especially cornerstone share holders, major share holders who hold more than 5% of a company's stock, directors, supervisors and upper management will have to increase their share holdings to stabilize share price, to protect the interests of investors. The document ""Notification to increasing stakes for major share holders, directors, supervisors and upper management of listed companies"", contents as following:

From China Securities Regulatory Commission to all stock exchanges, their subordinates and related units:

In order to maintain stability of the capital market, share holders, especially cornerstone share holders, major share holders (people who hold more than 5% of a company's stock), directors, supervisors and upper management will have to increase their share holdings to stabilize share price, to protect the interests of investors. Notification as following:

 1.  All major share holders, directors, supervisors and upper management who have sold their stakes within the last 6 months, through stock brokers, fund management companies and related entities, will not be bound by claus 47 of the securities law of china. You are now not allowed to sell. Fuck you. (Claus 47 mentions that you can sell company shares within 6 months of buying)

 2.  For all listed companies which share prices have dropped over 30% the last 10 trading days, directors, supervisors and upper management will have to increase their share holding and promise not to decrease their share holding in the coming 6 months. Claus 56 in which companies will have their trading halted if they are insolvent will not be applied here.

 4.   Encourage major share holders and directors, supervisors and upper management of listed companies to stabilize their share price by buying in when the share price drops violently.

 5.  Major share holders and directors, supervisors and upper management of listed companies will have to disclose their increase in share holdings publicly according to security laws of china, Regulations on the Takeover of Listed Companies, ""Administrative Measures for the Disclosure of Information of Listed Companies"".

 6.  This notification is valid from today at the time of the announcement.",515

15-07-08,3ck83g,"Everyone's 2nd Favorite Discussion: AAPL","Down to 123, presumably because of how crappy the iWatch has been. Didn't see that coming! /s... What are your long term views? We've never seen anything like Apple, so using relative comparisons is useless. They're too big to fail, and have too much going on behind the scenes to declare the innovation has died. We simply don't know that. All we have is these earnings reports, where they are making stupid amounts of money. Billions. Cash is still piling up, money is flowing like never before, even when consumer sentiment has leaned negative for, honestly, years now... Have they cracked the laws of large numbers? It's as if the biz ops have reached a threshold that allows for subpar operation, in terms of product output to consumers that'll still rake in unprecedented money. 123 right now might not be a bargain, unless you have tens of thousands to throw at it, or recycle other holdings towards it... but I am just not sure what to think anymore. Eventually there will be a downward spiral, but it's not right now. Right now, we're all wondering when it will bottom out a little bit, and when it will reach an all-time again. Because that's inevitable, almost. As inevitable as it gets on Wall Street for a big firm, IMHO. I SAY.... enough of this few-product BS. Expansion is necessary when you are no longer innovating with your core products. The competition has more than caught up in terms of performance, and whilst nobody offers the completeness of Apple, including aftermarket support, design, prestige, etc., something WILL give. The question is, where does Apple go before this happens? Sitting on 100+ billion of cash doesn't sound like pure buybacks to me. It sounds like 'IF YOU CAN DREAM IT, YOU CAN DO IT'..... So without Steve, what will they dream up next?",5

15-07-08,3ckcw4,VTI vs. VTSAX (Admiral shares version) Questions,"A few questions about vanguard admiral shares vs. the regular VTI index:

If you look at the charts for the two stocks today, you'll see that VTI has dropped 1.5%, whereas the admiral shares equivalent shows 0.5% increase, reflecting the market price of VTI from yesterday. Does that mean that if I wanted to buy the total stock market index at its price today in admiral shares form, I would have to wait till tomorrow to buy that 1.5% drop?

Why is that delay there? Why does VTSAX move only on a daily basis vs. normal ETFs moving regularly with every purchase? If there is that day delay, can't people make money by watching VTI and purchasing the day after it drops in admiral form and selling the day after it shoots up?

Thanks!",2

15-07-08,3cirtv,China blues.,"While everyone is fixated to the Grexit, China stock market has lost nearly $3T in matter of weeks. People say that the chinese stock market is isolated and not really part of the international market we have to look at the scale of destruction. $3T is like Germany's gdp. Today nikkei nearly lost 3% after the top government official asked market to exercise caution on China and Greece. I think China will be the bigger cause of worry in the coming future.   
Although the China market was quite isolated the cash earned from the market was being injected globally. A lot of Chinese buying into real estate in US/Canada/UK/Australia/Japan and other place will not have same kind of money and we might see house prices falling in such places. The housing market always has close relation with the stock market. I am not saying we may be hitting the bear market soon but some caution may be required.

15-07-08,3cla9b,How to stay up to date with news of my portfolio firms/markets?,"Hi Redditors,

I am new to investing and I have a few questions. My portfolio consists of mostly tech companies (mobile phones, games, etc). My questions:

1. I sometimes read that the share price of a stock goes up after a CEO is fired. How can that happen so fast? Are these extra buyers just people who happened to stumble across this information by accident? A CEO being fired is often not planned so it happens at a random date. Are news websites accurate for this or do they have a better source?

2. What business websites are worth reading and is there much difference between retail magazines? Right now I read Forbes, Fortune and Bloomberg online but I find the amount of articles I can browse to be limited. However, when I search for something business-related on Google search, I often stumble upon these. Do you have better suggestions? Would it be worth buying a non-digital subscription for Fortune, compared to just reading it online?

3. I am from the Netherlands, but I would still like to know the difference between online brokers. I read that ETRADE, the 'best' broker, charges a $10 fee per transaction? As a student with only €1000 to invest, surely this is not a good idea? Is this broker only for big investors? I also read that the benefits these websites provide you can also be easily found browsing the internet. Recommendations? How can this broker be considered so 'good' then?

4. Let's say my portfolio consists of stocks of 10 different companies. I want to know whenever something relevant to these individual companies happens, that could change my opinion about their stock's value. Is the only way to do this by constantly checking the 'Investor Relations' pages of these individual stocks and hoping that my 3 news websites keep me updated as well, or are there better methods? Is this something that good broker websites do for you?

As you can see, I have a lot of questions, haha! I hope you could take time to answer them, as I was unable to solve these questions by myself.

Thanks in advance.

15-07-08,3cj53l,Advice for stock picking noob,"Hello! I have a noob question, and it is of advice-soliciting nature.

I recently started picking stocks for value investing - I want to build a good enough fortune and move to a warm island when I'm old (no joke). I'm doing this by picking stocks instead of buying index funds because I think picking stocks is fun! It keeps me invested (no pun intended) because I like checking in and researching new buys!

I just started out, and I have a list of stocks I want to buy in the coming months (although I do a check to see if they're overvalued before buying). I'm not very diversified, with only four stocks in my portfolio - like I said, I just started. 

The market in my country is diving, but I'm beating the index that I want to beat. So, I'm doing better than my market over the past couple of months, consistently by a couple percentage points. I need to believe that this is because I picked stocks that are good for the current market situation here, because what's the point if I'm going to treat it like the random process scientists have proved it to be?

Question: should I still diversify and buy into more different companies or should I see this as a sign that I'm doing the right thing and continue, for the time being, to invest in my four companies that I believed in and that aren't doing as badly as most of the market right now?",0

15-07-08,3cj5t0,Becoming a Slumlord,"So I'm talking to my brother who lives in San Francisco and he tells me about how the rents/housing is crazy expensive over there. Also about how the traffic is horrendous so commuting is equivalent of hell on earth.

I go on craigslist to investigate and yes the rents are sky high. THIS GOT ME THINKING. There has got to be a way to make money off this. Housing is in short-supply, building codes are restrictive, not enough new housing being built etc. In other words: perfect opportunity for someone who can think of innovative ways to provide more housing.

Here is the moneymaking solution: become a slumlord landlord! 

Here is the idea: Buy a 3bed/2bath house in some highly desirable location, close to tech companies and other places of employment. Rehab the entire house to convert it into a higher occupancy household. With each bedroom, place a divider in the middle and convert it into 2 bedrooms that way each tenant gets a private room but smaller. Take the garage and do the same, put carpet and a divider down the middle, bam 2 more bedrooms. Slash the rent by 20% of the normal price, so a bedroom that would normally rent for 1,000 would rent for 800 and then since you are renting to 2 people it would net you $1,600/month. The basic idea is to just rearrange the house to build more rentable bedrooms without having to build an expensive addition.

Thoughts? Anyone done something similar? Seems like the biggest issues would be neighbors complaining and if government people find out, not sure what they would do.

What I was wondering is where should I start. Before I took off on this journey I thought that I had the drop on the stock market, and knew really, everything that there was to know about it, but, boy was I ever wrong. 

Here are some questions that I have, and, I'll re-list them at the end for organizational purposes but, where do I find stocks? I understand there are hundreds of thousands of companies that I can put my money into, is there a website where I can devise my own algorithm/requirements and it spits out stocks that match? Say I input: buy price ($300+), 24hr high ($300+), market cap (....) and it gave me a list of tickers: i.e. AAPL, GOOGL..........  
Really, where do I start? Where do I find where to funnel my money?

Day trading? Where do I start?

What I'm asking, I've read all the resources on the sidebar and I'm wondering:

Where do I start?
How do I determine where to allocate my funds?
What are the different exchanges?
Do you have any other information?

Thanks,

I would like to use this money to try my hand at investing, or I would like to put this money somewhere safe where it can grow. Currently, I have a bank account in my name and a debit card. So my question is, what advice do you have for a kid who is looking to grow this money during his upcoming college years? I have heard people mention Vanguard, but I'm not sure how I get started with that.

According to the Treasury, 30-year treasury bond yields are [2.99%](http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yield). They're rated AA+ and the yields are taxable as ordinary income.

According to [this source](http://www.fmsbonds.com/market_yields/index.asp), 30-year AAA-rated municipal bonds are averaging 3.2%, and that's *tax-free*. So higher return, less risk, and lower taxes. If we want the same risk at AA, we get 3.75%! Assuming a 25% tax rate, that's a 56% higher yield for the same risk.

So why own treasuries? Why own total bond market? Can an investor get a free lunch by holding AAA municipal bonds instead?

Is total bond market overvalued because of passive index investors bidding up its price?

 In the past couple of days I have been in other ""trading"" subreddits and they all seem to be open to opinions. The people on those subreddits are very open minded and are not limiting themselves to one style of trading. For some reason this subreddit hasn't been open to opinions. Any post that's an opinion gets downvoted into oblivion and never gets a solid chance. The only posts on the top of the front page are posts like ""What do you guys think of X stock"". 

In other trading subreddits (investing, stockmarket, daytrading, etc) they are not downvoting posts just because they dislike the person or because they disagree. They only downvote when a post is ""spam"". 

So my point is, I think it would make this subreddit a lot better if people weren't so quick to downvote posts. If someone gives you advice (Even if it is bad advice), just be happy you are getting advice. Because when you think about it, 99%+ of traders DO NOT get advice from anyone.

15-07-09,3cooyp,Bloomberg: Complexity Curse Turns Into Blessing in NYSE Hours-Long Halt (xpost from /r/finance),"(Bloomberg) -- You might have heard about the New York Stock Exchange’s trading halt Wednesday. If you were an investor, that’s probably all that happened -- you heard about it.

In a fragmented market where no venue controls more than 16 percent of volume, the halt was almost impossible to detect for anyone but professional traders and brokers, according to Yousef Abbasi of JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC. Anyone who wanted to buy or sell stocks could, just not at NYSE.
“Today proves that we have a resilient infrastructure,” said Abbasi, the global market strategist at JonesTrading in New York. “If something goes down, something else picks it up. Trading goes on.”
At the same time, the rupture joins a series of high-profile breakdowns from Knight Trading’s order deluge in August 2012 to the May 2010 flash crash that embolden critics who say the market’s very complexity makes it unreliable.

“Far too many investors are already concerned that our critical trading technology infrastructure is held together by dangling wires and duct tape,” Dave Lauer, co-founder and chief technology officer of Kor Group LLC, wrote in an e-mail Wednesday. “Today definitely doesn’t help dispel that fear.”
The best and worst of electronic markets were on display Wednesday, when a computer malfunction forced a 3 1/2-hour halt on the NYSE that was easily sealed off from other venues. There are so many places to trade now that the NYSE and Nasdaq Stock Market have gone from handling 80 percent of volume in 1997 to 40 percent on average last month.

Fragmentation Proponents

“The proponents of more fragmentation in the U.S. market are happy this happened, to show that competition of exchanges is a better thing,” said Frank Maeba, managing partner at Breton Hill Capital in Toronto. “I personally think it’s a bit messy.”

The NYSE’s systems are all functioning normally in Thursday’s trading, the firm said in a statement.
Two people briefed on a preliminary review said the computer malfunction that knocked out trading probably stemmed from a software update that went awry. The NYSE must now verify the cause and report its conclusions to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said the people, who asked not to be named because the inquiry isn’t public.

Tom Farley, the exchange’s president, made the decision to suspend trading when it became apparent investors couldn’t rely on the market to provide accurate data.

‘Configuration Problem’

“There was a configuration problem in our system,” Farley said in an interview with Bloomberg television. “It likely had to do with an upgrade but that’s premature and it’s something that will come about as part of our full analysis of the situation.”

The suspension, lasting from 11:32 a.m. to just after 3 p.m. New York time, temporarily removed the 223-year-old NYSE from the network of platforms that makes up the American equity market. That network kept running, however, as exchanges such as the Nasdaq Stock Market and Bats Global Markets Inc. picked up the runoff.

“If a client called up and wanted me to execute a trade, I could still do it,” said Michael Antonelli, an institutional equity sales trader and managing director at Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. in Milwaukee. “You can trade U.S. equities on lots of different venues. That’s a plus and minus today.”

The two NYSE venues affected by the shutdown handled about 14 percent of all U.S. stock volume in June, with the rest spread among competitors such as Bats and Nasdaq and dozens of dark pools and other private platforms operated by securities firms.

‘Good Reminder’

Brokers were able to steer orders to buy and sell stocks, even those listed on NYSE, away from their home exchange on a day when concerns about China’s economy and Greece contributed to a 1.7 percent drop in the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index, the second-biggest decline since March.

The disruption underscored how quickly the calm can be broken in the U.S. stock market, where about $270 billion worth of stocks trade hands each day. Order has occasionally broken down in a system that is spread among 11 different exchanges and dozens of private venues.

“Today is a good reminder on the number of diverse venues out there, which has frustrated traders for a while,” said Craig Viani, vice president at Greenwich Associates in Stamford, Connecticut. “There are a lot of people out there who long for a consolidated market view, but the byproduct of fragmentation is that it does strengthen market stability.”

Too Many

Eleven exchanges are too many for Themis Trading LLC’s Joe Saluzzi. They exist not to serve individual investors but to make it possible for high-frequency traders to do battle with each other by sniffing out price discrepancies, he said.

“Those are the extra fragmentations you don’t need and are using it just for arbitraging,” Saluzzi said. “You can have three exchanges and you can aggregate liquidity better and get rid of the fragmentation issue. I’d still argue that fragmentation is a bad thing.”

To market watchers like Jaret Seiberg of Guggenheim Securities LLC, nothing that happened Wednesday hurt his confidence in the market’s integrity.

Fragmentation “means there is still robust trading even when a major exchange experiences a technical glitch,” Seiberg, an analyst at Guggenheim, wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. “This is negative for those who complain that market fragmentation is hurting liquidity and small investors.”",2

15-07-09,3cnkhw,Foreign investment property advice needed,"Hello Reddit! For various reasons, I am very interested in purchasing investment property in Uruguay. Probably around ~$150,000 USD is what I'm looking to invest. Since I will be spending the majority of my time in the US, I figured I will have the property managed by a management firm which I expect to take somewhere around 8-15% of the monthly rent based on my research. Depending on my interest rate, I believe I will be able to rent it out for slightly more than my monthly mortgage payment. As of right now my base salary is $23/hr giving me a base salary of ~$48,000. I do make much more than this, but I was advised to exclude my overtime to give me a sort of 'safety net'. Counting my overtime, I made a hair over $105,000 salary last year since my shifts are 12 hours and the oilfield was booming. I have about $5,000 cash on hand (emergency fund), ~$13,000 worth of stock I am eligible to sell (should be getting another ~$3K or so next month of company stock that I won't be able to sell for 6 months), and I have a 401(K) balance of ~$21,700 of which ~$11,500 is full vested (how much I keep if I leave before working a minimum of 4 years w/ the company). Obviously I would have to take out a loan to pay for such property. My question though has to do with getting the funding for a down payment, particularly since this is a foreign investment. What tax liability would I incur if I withdraw money from my 401(K) or sold my stocks? If I sold it all ($13K stocks &amp; $11.5K vested 401K) how much would I have left over for a down payment?

15-07-09,3cnt16,Beginner advice on the stock market on the side.,"Hi there,

First of I'll give you some background, I'm a 21yo from Australia with ~$37,000 in assets currently working full time and have some money invested in a 10y growth bond and investing $244 a month. My uncle bought me some stocks in Westpac Bank when I was born, I have no idea how many shares I have but they are under my name and my mum estimated them to be worth $5,000(Currently $32.880ea). I have been looking at buying an investment property but as I am an apprentice and earning ~$680 a week I can't afford to do so just yet without help from my parents so I am postponing this until I am earning more. 


I have recently decided to invest more money and do a little bit of research into my options, my cousin is a financial adviser and does all of my financing and I have an appointment with him next Monday to discuss my options. I mentioned to my mum that I wanted to invest in a Vanguard index fund, long story short, my mum told me to take $500 and 'play a little game with the stock market'. Turns out when I first mentioned it to my parents, they weren't aware I wanted to go through a managed fund and thought I wanted to directly buy and sell stocks myself. They are now aware of what I want to do and only want me to go through my financial advisor.

So whilst I am wisely(IMO) investing money and I AM going to get professional advice shortly, I would like to experience the stock market on the side by myself with $500. Long term or short term, I don't mind.

So here's some background. 
I'm 28 and currently AD Air Force. I have ~$25K in the Traditional TSP and do 10% per paycheck. I have nothing in Roth TSP.  And I don't come near maxing the TSP yearly contributions limit.

I also have a USAA investment account with USMIX mutual fund and some GE stock. This pretty much acts as my emergency fund w/ about 3.5x my base pay.

I'm not sure if I want to stay in the military until retirement. No matter what though, I'd like to at least partially retire early.

These questions stem mainly from my military career uncertainty and the inability to convert my traditional TSP into Roth. So, here's what I'm struggling with:

- Should I start contributing to the Roth TSP? Even if my military future is uncertain? If yes, should I stop allocating to the traditional and try to come close to maxing the Roth?

- Or should I open a Vanguard IRA, max that, and then put my additional savings into the Traditional? 

- Or should I do something else I'm not thinking of?

Today, the stock fell 11.11% on volume of 2.1 Million shares. For context, the average volume on the ticker is ~52,000 and while it's volatile, today's move was extreme. 

The big move came at 11 am and from then to the close of the day, no one knew what the fuck had happened. There had been no news from the company, no earnings, no disasters, nothing.

I'm a fledgling stock market investor from India.

People in this sub are great fans of index funds. However here in India very few people invest in index funds . Even people knowledgeable in financial markets advice people against investing in them.

There are three major reasons they give :

* Tracking error : Most index funds in India fail to accurately track the underlying index . The tracking error is too high.

* Efficient Markets : Markets in India are not as efficient as the ones in the US and so there are plenty of opportunities for good stock pickers to deliver outsized returns.

* Returns :- Looking at the past 5 - 7 years , there are plenty of mutual funds that have 20 -25 % annualized returns while the index funds are at 15 - 16 % .

So I'm really confused now . 

Are index funds only good for developed markets like the US ?

15-07-09,3co0sd,ETFs vs. directly owning underlying shares,"Hey guys,

Assuming that trading/brokerage fees and time spent buying/selling individual shares are not an issue, my question is, are there advantages to directly owning the underlying shares of individual stocks vs. owning an ETF that represents those underlying stocks?

For example, again assuming fees/time are not an issue, is there an advantage to directly owning the shares of the 500 companies comprising the S&amp;P 500 index vs. simply owning shares of SPY or IVV?

I know that ETFs have management fees, but they are oftentimes very low.

I also know that due to the structure of ETFs, there is some amount of counter-party risk involved. Is this risk high enough that there is a significant advantage to owning the stocks directly?

All things being equal, are there enough advantages to owning stocks directly vs. an ETF that represents them in order to do so?

I launched a discussion on this a month ago when Hercules filed for Bankruptcy.

http://redd.it/3ach2z

Pacific ""PACD"" is currently at $2.55

It seems to further my thoughts that sometime this year I see acquisitions of smaller drilling companies by larger companies. With the glut of rigs, it makes no sense to continue building them and add to the oversupply but simply purchase other companies with a modern fleet and contracts and assume their work.

Personally, I see Transocean ""RIG"" making the first buy during this downturn.

1. They have a large line of untapped credit.

2. The Macondo Settlement is closed and they were fined no where near what they expected.

3. Due to Macondo they didn't build rigs without contracts so their glut is with their existing fleet.

4. They've retired half of their fleet, from 120 rigs down to 65 in the fleet at the moment, and still not finished. This has brought their average age up to 10-15 yrs of rig age.

Now here's where the big points come into play. 

5. Transocean has been built on Mergers and buyouts. Ex: Aker, Global Santa Fe, R&amp;B Falcon, Sedco, Forex.....

6. The new CEO is from NOV ""NOV $44.16"" which is a company built on aggressive takeovers and mergers of other companies.

Right now, I don't see any big mergers between the giants, but more so a slaughterhouse amongst all the smaller players who own 3-5 newer rigs and don't have the capitol to maintain them.

Maersk ""MAERSKB"" is another rumored favorite for doing takeovers. Ocean Rig ""ORIG $4.71"" on the other hand seems prime to be bought out.

Only time will tell.",2

15-07-10,3crn37,UPDATE: My Swingtrades Tests,"NOTE: The ""stocktradinggame"" came way after that list above, so there are a few I missed (like ICLD).

Here are my swingtrades:

http://i.imgur.com/aFdgoK9.png

http://stocktradinggame.org/stockchallenge/position.php?uid=1698#anchor

I got short on FREE and SGNL on the game and am going to hold for a couple of days. They to me seem pretty free in terms of % gains. Both coming off of big bounces and starting to fade. SGNL I'd expect to fade back off to 1.50, it may bounce 1 more time but that would be it IMO. FREE I just expect to keep fading because I don't think anything is holding this stock up ATM, a short squeeze can still happen but I will hold through it.

 I started this project about 2 months ago and have found a cool finviz scan that gets me the stocks I need for these swingtrades. The success I have been having with it seems a bit undeserved because of how little effort it takes. I recently closed up on HERO because I felt that it could rebound for a short period and didn't really want to lose the 10% that was there.

I personally don't like swingtrading that much and probably will never even bother attempting it (with real money).

15-07-09,3cpvdu,Why you should buy some shares in NBG tomorrow.,"**Note: This is not investing; this is speculation.**

Yesterday, I bought some NBG stock, shortly, after the share price fell on bad news concerning the economic status of Greece. Since then, I'm up around 15%. 

If you elect to buy shares in NBG, keep in mind that this is a short term play, not a long term investment. 

Now, if you are going long NBG, you are betting on two things:

1. Greece will get another bailout, and stave off the threat of Euro exit for now. 
2. Tsipras will not nationalize the country's banks. 

No one wants Greece to exit from the Euro. This drama has happened before, and we all know how it turned out - the Greeks got their bailout from the EU to stave off a Grexit. And it will happen again on Sunday. The other European nations are pressuring Germany to stop playing the bad cop and to give the Greek banking system the liquidity it needs for the Greek economy to function. Once a deal is reached, NBG should shoot up anywhere between 50% and 100%. 

This is easy money right here - obviously still a risky play, so don't bet the farm on it, but I'm looking forward to a nice capital gain on Monday. ",0

As a newbie to investing, what would be the next course of action? He had about $500K USD before the crash. I know trying to predict the bottom is not very feasible, and selling after a crash is a bit of a panic move. 

Would it be better to move the money from the Chinese stock market to Vanguard (Total U.S. Stock Market Index Fund, Total Bond Index Fund) at this point?

Back story: 

I'm 23 years old, only have stock in APPL, and am looking to diversify. I have it all traded through a company called computershare. I'm not sure how I feel about them, and may switch to something like etrade.

I want to diversify by buying Disney, Microsoft, and a solar company like solarcity. 

Any thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated. I'd be looking to keep all of this money within the stock market. I'm not looking to withdraw anything for personal use at this time and will be in it for the long run, not day trading. I would also like dividends to go into a separate bank account.

EDIT: You guys have been super helpful. Thank you so much for taking the time to talk to me about this and share your ideas. I will wait until dividends yield and then sell off a good portion of the apple stock to diversify. Ill still keep half, and move the rest into other places.

I am currently an senior economics major planning on going to law school next fall. I have a paid internship in NYC and was wondering if I should put $2000 to $3000 of my earnings into a mutual fund. I have a part time job as a bartender, so I should be able to make the monthly fees. People have discouraged me from doing this because they say that the money is more valuable to me now than later, but I live with my parents and don't have too many expenses other than car fuel. 

I like the idea of a mutual fund because it is generally a liquid investment, so I could take my money out whenever I need it. ",17

Regardless, I think this company could be a game changer in solar, so here's a [PR](http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/prnewswire/NY52800.htm) for the interested. 

The short version is that they're an R&amp;D company loaded with patents for making solar panels more efficient and cheaper to produce, which is going to be really fucking important next year when government subsidies expire...

Plus, their CTO was head of NASA's Photovoltaic Research for 15 years, so he basically developed the solar panels that we will be putting on our space yachts.

Shanghai/Shenzen barely made it to -40%, then bounced back hard. Damn commies. Now things are moving up again, the government is actually encouraging insane margin, and all the smart money that pulled out early is ready for a second helping of easy profits. The barely educated momentum traders are wisely going to buy the fucking dip. Sorry guys, that was the crash, and this bounce is signal, not noise. 

Do I know what I'm doing? Hell no. Think for yourself. But for months, I've obsessively read everything I can find on China, because I like making money and I like being right. This is the first bubble I could trade on, and I was determined to make profits. Mission accomplished. Now I can go back to losing money, or I can buy a little CHAU. Then a little more when the trend is confirmed. An actual smart move would be to buy twice as many calls as puts, but that's not why I'm on r/wallstreetbets. Oh well.

Now, with the China market having tanked, bloodying Xi's and Li's enormous political capital (and egos), it looks like Li has said that enough is enough. 

They seriously kitchen sinked this thing and the Chinese markets have turned around (at least for now). Barring the ChiNext market, which proves China was envious of the 2000 Nasdaq bubble, valuations are not out of line at these levels.

With reasonable valuations; investors primed to play the market; government, fund and corporate buying; an end to most short sales; lower rates and more liquidity; and all of the safety guards removed, might we have a Li put shaping up?

15-07-10,3ctmnj,"Thoughts on Chinese collapse's possible connection to Greece accepting austerity","I've been wondering why Greece caved in an accepted worse austerity measures than they just rejected in a referendum (albeit in exchange for some debt-relief). Might it have had anything to do with the Chinese collapse and the fact that the Chinese government's intervention in its domestic market leaves it in no position to prop up or lend to Greece in a Grexit scenario? It seems like China and Russia were the two powers that would seek to cash in on a Grexit to make inroads into Europe -- that's where Greece was implicitly threatening to turn. Russia is economically constrained, so has limited ability to prop up Greece. So it's likely that China's current turmoil was the last straw that made Tsipras give in.

15-07-10,3cswvp,Stock transferred from family member to my optionshouse account. Does original purchase date still apply for taxes?,"Hello,

My brother worked for a company that had their IPO last year, He was able to buy some stock at the IPO price, so we split it. He had to hold the shares in his account for a few months before he could move it to his brokerage account, he just transfered my shares to me today. 

My question, will the original purchase date still apply as far as short term vs long term capitol gains is concerned? It's set to go long term in september which is when I'll likely sell, just want to make sure the original date of purchase would still apply to me. ",2

1. When Brent crude was around $100 bbl last summer, UWTI was around $35 per share.  Is there a good way to accurately calculate the effects of decay over time?
2.  Can someone, in plain english, explain the difference between an ETN and an ETF?
3.  If brent went back up to $100 bbl. tomorrow what would be the price of UWTI and how would you calculate it?  I know that time and momentum of price shifts are also a factor in calculating this but it'd be great if someone could expand on it. 
4.  Can someone clarify how much decay and fees influence the price of UWTI? 

5.  Can someone simply quantify why it is a bad idea to hold this over the long term?

I'm sure a lot of people would be interested in this subject considering the upside potential of the oil market over the coming years. ",6

Even if an agreement is reached, and NBG doesn't go insolvent due to bank runs, there will be a massive number of shares issued to raise money therefore diluting your position.

I saw a thread earlier that compared NBG to C and said they wished they went all in C when it was under a dollar. That is not a fair comparison as Greece is in terrible economic shape with around 50% unemployment. BAC, WFC, C, JPM never faced any of those risks during the financial collapse because their deposit base was so broad.

This is too risky for me.

15-07-11,3cv70u,Switched employers and am transferring my 401k to a self managed IRA. Just a few questions,"Hello all, long time lurker and first time poster in this sub.

Just a quick backstory about myself: 25, Single, Male, BA in Business Management concentration in Finance, minimal student loans, no other revolving debt and employed by a financial institution. Moderate to Aggressive investing mindset, nothing really to lose for now but a lot to hopefully gain.

I recently left my first employer that offered a 401k. I accumulated about $4,000 that I plan on transferring to an IRA. At my new employer I will be contributing 5% of my paycheck towards this new employers 401k.

Just a few questions:

1. I am immediately vested at this new job, 100% match for the first 3%, 50% match for the next 2%. Just to clarify, if I were to make $10,000 per year, they would contribute $300 for the first 3% and $100 for the next 2%. Immediately vested meaning that if I left the company within one year I would not forfeit those contributions assuming no exit fees.

2. I have an etrade brokerage account and was wondering if there are any promotions anywhere currently for opening a new IRA with a balance this small ($4000).

3. Lets say at my new employer I can purchase company stock. I do not know for sure but I assume I can buy the shares at a discount maybe 5%? Just wondering what anyone's opinion on symbol SAN is. IMO its price hasn't really grown to much in the past decade but pays a 3.3% dividend. I know they recently transferred to American soil so that could be a key factor. Just wondering from an investing standpoint if that symbol is a smart play for the next say 5 years?

4. Just because I am a huge coin collector and fan of precious metal's I was also wondering what anyone's opinion on some long term SLV calls are? ",3

15-07-11,3cvbyx,I think BGMD has driven me crazy.,"So for those who aren't familiar with this unhappy tale, $BGMD had a 4:1 reverse split a little while ago and the stock has gone way down, and looks like it may go even lower.

I could dump it now, of course, but what complicates the issue is that there's all sorts of hints that this stock could still go WAY UP in the future. Upcoming events, huge amounts of shares being bought, low float, supposedly-brilliant (if almost certainly evil) management, etc. I could bail and cut my losses, but then I'll miss out on any chance of getting FAT PROFITS.

Should I stay? Should I go? Well, as my portfolio value goes down and my stress levels go up, I've hatched a crazy plan... TO DO BOTH. Here's the basic layout:

*****

1) SELL ALL MY SHARES.

2) Use proceeds to flip stocks, make some profit, YOLO, etc. Stuff that will get my mind off BGMD.

3) Buy back in before the next event (July 22). If things stay as they are, the stock price should have gone LOWER, so I can probably buy even more stocks with the same amount of money I sold for in step 1.

4) Ride the rising stock prices to PROFIT.

*****

Of course, this crazy plan is not without risks, which I'll outline here:

**POSSIBLE RISK #1** The stock price will go up after I sell. Currently the stock prices are steadily declining, but considering the stock manipulation and general shadiness of this stock, it's possible that the price will rocket up while my back is turned.

**POSSIBLE RISK #2** I'll be so glad to get away from this stock that I won't go past step two. After I sell, I'll jump around screaming ""I'M FREE!"" and refuse to have anything to do with BGMD ever again.

**POSSIBLE RISK #3** BGMD is doomed. Even if I follow each step of my plan thoroughly, the price still dips extremely low, $BGMD gets delisted, and winds up being relegated to that dark place where penny stocks are sent to rot, and where investors' hopes and dreams go to die.

...how likely are these risks? No idea, really. ""Possible"" risk #2 seems pretty legit, though.

*****

In conclusion:

Heck if I know man, I think I've just gone straight cray-cray. ._.

(To be honest, I'm not sure if I'll seriously try this. I might just throw my hands up into the air and shout ""SCREW IT!"" and hold long-term. HECK IF I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING...!)",3

15-07-11,3cws0i,Is Sprint a value buy simply from their spectrum ownership?,"So here are my thoughts: Sprint [S] is near an all time low. They have ~4BN shares out at  under $4/share. My thoughts are if you look at the recent FCC auctions (700MHz in 2008 raised ~$20BN, AWS auction 2015 raised ~$45BN) that the value for licenses is going up very fast. 

For those not familiar with it, it is kind of like real estate, they are not really making any more, and it is a finite resource. Sprint owns some prime real estate here with the 800MHz bands (from their old iDEN network), and the PCS G block across the entire country.

My thinking is that the value of these assets alone far exceed the value of the company, so this would make it a value buy before even factoring in their other physical assets like towers, stores, buildings, and everything else.

15-07-11,3cxauy,UVXY Options Proposal,"I'm thinking of selling calls on UVXY, the leaps 01/20/2017. I have the equity to sell 95 calls at 16.70 per contract and collect $158,650 in premium. Obviously with a leveraged ETF, this thing can move, but would require serious backwardation for a significant period of time as well as a spike in market volatility. Looking at the futures on the $VIX at the moment, they are experiencing contango and UVXY appears to be sliding to a worthless ETF. In addition, with the $VIX being a mean reverting index, my trade probability calculator is showing a 6% chance of UVXY closing above 95.00 on 01/20/2017. 

I know I'm not the first person to think of this. Maybe this is the wrong forum but I just can't see a reason why not to do this. Honestly, I doubt I'd hold until expiration just because I don't want to lock up a lot of buying power for that long, but it may be worth it to let maybe a year of time value out of these and close out when volatility is low..


Thoughts?

EDIT: Selling naked calls. ",15

As the title says back in the 1929 crash the US did a similar act, encouraging brokerages to invest in the market. 

My question is back in 1929 when the US did this were they successful in creating a rally ? Did the rally last a month ? A week ?

15-07-12,3czp2y,Question on 401k contributions with a low salary,"Hey guys, forgive me if this noob territory but I'm in need of some investing advice.  I'm 25 years old and have a six-month emergency fund and a portfolio of about 30k (mostly vanguard ETFs and a few small stock picks for fun).

I'm currently amidst a career change and am working at an entry-level position in the 15% tax bracket.  I'm just now learning about retirement accounts and I plan on opening and maxing out a Roth IRA this week.  However, I also want take full advantage of my company's 401k but I'm not sure exactly how to proceed.

I know there's a lot of talk about a forthcoming market correction / bear market.  I also know that time in the market beats timing the market (especially when we're talking about a retirement account with a 40 year horizon).

Given the fact that my current salary is low and it's not easy for me to max out my 401k contributions, which strategy do you think is best:

1. Defer only 33% of my income to my 401k and invest the rest in my regular brokerage account so that I have the option of liquidity in case I find myself unemployed during a nasty economic downturn.

2. Defer the maximum my employer allows (75% of my income) into my 401k right now since I want to get as close to maxing it out as I possibly can every single year.  I can still easily live off the remainder since I'm very frugal and have low living expenses.

Thanks in advance for any recommendations or guidance.  Sorry if I'm overlooking something obvious or not grasping a basic concept.",2

15-07-11,3cyedr,Don’t be a sheep – Have a plan.,"Don’t be sheep

On 7/10/2015 one of the biggest trading chat-room had an open “Free” day for traders who want to check the room, so I decided to check it out before the market opens , when I tuned in , the “CEO” of the service was talking, “giving a speech”  defending himself against the allegation that was  presented in a trading review website that accused him of pumping stocks his subscribers , he was explaining that his service is not alert service and he prefer to focus on the education side of trading and explain why he took that trade as he don’t want his “students”  to follow him blindly which is 100% correct attitude as I also believe no one should follow anyone blindly and no one turned into successful trader by simply mirroring other trades .

I must say I didn’t stay in the room other than the first hour before market opens and 10 minutes into the market open ,  But let’s see what was his watch-list and trades he took ( or moderators) and what we can learn from this trades as a student.

When I entered the room there was an alert on CY “the reason of the entry is because of a billionaire invested in the stock, the entry was over 12.

CY: (moderator alert)

The stock opened under 12 and faded all day.

KONE: (moderator alert)

The moderator alerted that he’s trying to enter on the open with market order but his order is pending, as he finally was filled at 6.9 and managed to add at 6.8+ and sold at 7.2 which is totally BS , anyone who tried to play the stock long from the open more likely lost money and not have a profitable trade as the stock faded all day long.

At this points I exited the room but I do remember that the “CEO” of the service put out his Watch-list for the 500+ people in the chat-room which included HOTR and VGGL (as far as I remember).

Let’s see what we can learn from this watch-list:

VGGL:

The stock trades 500K shares a day in Average The price is trending lower after it broke down a base, so why in earth you would buy a stock and alert it to your “students” what is the lesson here? Buy from support? Fibonacci Retracement? Or just a pure pump and speculative play? Hoping that your “students” will follow you blindly and buy it all together to pump the price of the stock.

Don’t get me wrong this kind of plays could work, as these kind of penny stocks also get a pump Press releases from the company itself that could pump the stock (KONE as an example) but there’s no lesson to tech here other than :

Open a chat-room
Make a free chat-room day.
Pump illiquid penny stock to the people in the chat-room and make them PAY you during this FREE chat-room day.
Have a plan:

Having a trading plan ahead of the trading session is a fundamental aspect of trading, you must be prepared with stocks to trade with Buy zone, target zone and specified stop loss.

These Four elements of the plan (Stocks, Buy, Sell and the stop loss) are crucial for your trading and you must try to follow them during the trading day and consider everything else as a pure noise.

a) Shouldn't my $5,500 have been taxed? I thought the contributions to a Roth IRA were taxed and then the earnings were tax free, but I've got the full $5,500 in my account.

b) I read somewhere (after putting in the money) that I can't contribute $5,500 if I didn't make that much in income this last year then I can only contribute how much I made. I reported a few thousand in income last year (can't remember the exact number, but it was from a couple summer jobs) but definitely not $5,500. However, I will certainly be filing $5,500+ next year when I file taxes. Will this cause complications? Should I take back some of my contributions?",2

2015 MTV Fandom Awards - Ready your feels, fanboys and fangirls. The MTV Fandom Awards are back for a second celebration of all things geek culture. Bella Thorne and Tyler Posey are ready to host the awards from San Diego Comic-Con, with performances from Flo Rida and All Time Low. That said, can you livestream the 2015 MTV Fandom Awards? You would think that you’d be able to watch a show about the internet on the internet. 

Unfortunately, while you can watch the inaugural 2014 MTV Fandom Awards on demand at MTV’s website, and much of the MTV Movie Awards content was made available this year via live stream, there do not appear to be any such plans for the Fandom Awards. This isn’t too surprising, especially considering that the show will be taped Thursday night and broadcast on Sunday.

15-07-11,3cyhiz,"Higher demand stock due to easier access = bubble? What's wrong with my thinking?","Hello,

I am new to investing and I would like it if you could share your views with me regarding this matter. As stock prices increase in the long term (= demand &gt; supply), shouldn't internet access and lowered broker costs (which might be non-existent in the future) lead to the supply-demand equilibrium being increasingly disturbed? Having a share of a company is the main use of shares, although reselling appears to be the main use for many. But this increasingly higher demand should inflate the 'value' of companies by too much, as people just get into the stock market because they know these returns &gt; returns on other types of investment, instead of really wanting a piece of a company? This also increases demand. In the end, it is not so much a company's value that people care to hold a share for, it is the intention of reselling it for more? It appears to be true for basically everyone, in my mind at least. Especially individual investors, who are likely to do nothing with the share other than catching dividend or reselling it: the individual investor is not going to get enough stock together so that he can exercise his rights to change a company's course.

Had $23k in a savings account

In April 2015 put 13k in Betterment account, and have lost around 4% (Not worried about it as I have this account open to make money in the long run) 

Have been making monthly deposits, and am up to 14k invested

Now have 10k in savings account, but want to invest in equity (Betterment account is all ETF's)

I want to keep a solid chunk of cash (maybe around 8k) in my savings due to moving out on my own soon / to have some money to play around with, but also want to keep my Betterment account open.

My question to you is - should I take 5 or 6k out of my Betterment account (what would tax implications be?) and put this money into a diversified portfolio of equities? I'm thinking of buying stock in Nike, possibly GoPro (releasing drones in 2016) some organic food distributors, and automobile part manufacturers.

Why Investing Is So Complicated, and How to Make It Simpler

I finally faced up to something I had been dreading.

After years of procrastinating, I logged on to my retirement account. Just working my way through the rigmarole of retrieving lost passwords and locating my investments was bad enough. But once I started to examine my portfolio, I began to feel anxious. Some of my money was in mutual funds, but I had no sense of how I chose them. And the rest of my money was in cash, earning virtually nothing; how had I let it sit there for so long? With trepidation, I began flicking through screen after screen of investment choices, each one filled with a seemingly endless stream of jargon.

I seemed to have fallen into a recurrent nightmare, one in which I am taking a final exam in a class I never attended and a subject I don’t understand. This was even more embarrassing: I am, after all, a trained economist. When new acquaintances learn what I do for a living, they routinely ask, “So how should I invest my money?” I wish I knew.


But this is an ordeal for nearly everyone, whatever their training. No wonder many of us avoid thinking about long-term investments, especially for retirement. A recent survey by Charles Schwab found that most of us spend twice as much time choosing a car as we do choosing investments that are supposed to support us for years.

A relaxing retirement is supposed to be the reward for a lifetime of work, and yet it seems we must pass an entrance exam to reach it.

I’ve been wrestling with how we got to this point. Why is investing so complicated? And what should we do about it in our own lives, and as a society?

Investing isn’t what most of us do for a living. When a mutual fund company asks me what I want to invest in, it seems like the wrong question. It’s like a taxicab driver in a new city asking me, “Which route do you want to take?” Don’t ask. Just take me there. I paid the fare. Is it really my job to figure out the route to my hotel?

I want to reach my retirement with a nest egg that allows me to maintain my current lifestyle and to travel a bit. If I save what I’m supposed to, I would like someone else to figure out the best route.

Employer-provided pensions still do this for you, and if you’re lucky enough to have one — and it’s solid — congratulations. For most of us, though, they are not an option: Pensions have been disappearing, for many reasons. And many of the remaining ones are underfunded and vulnerable. Expanding employer-provided pensions seems to be a non-starter, much as we might like to see that happen.

Can’t the market fix things? If individuals are forced to choose their investments, why doesn’t the market make these choices easier?

By all accounts, the world of mutual funds, which is the basis for many retirement investments, is a competitive market. At the end of 2014, there were more than 20,000 mutual funds. On top of that, there are hundreds of exchange-traded funds. While many of these funds sit in a few big-name companies, one would hardly call this a monopolized industry. We’ve got plenty of choices.

The market seems to work well for consumers in other industries. The producers of smartphones, for example, compete fiercely to make simple and elegant user interfaces. If they can make it a breeze to interact with billions of lines of code, why can’t somebody simplify the alchemy of finance?

What distinguishes the market for investments is our inability to judge whether we have chosen well. Once I’ve used a phone for a few weeks, I can tell whether it was worth the money. By contrast, I may not know for decades (if ever) whether an investment was wise or foolish. Does a low return signal a prudent choice or a missed opportunity? And by the time the answer becomes clear, it’s already too late. You’ve got to live with your bad choice.

What’s more, the invisible hand of competition does not do well by consumers with limited understanding. Rather than eliminating biases, markets often cater to them. For example, many consumers choose a mutual fund by looking at last year’s returns, despite warnings that they should not do so. This creates a winner-take-all situation with the highest-performing funds getting most of the investors. You might think this encourages funds to produce higher returns, and that might seem to be a good thing.

But what it actually produces is a perverse incentive for fund companies to take risks. That’s because investors often choose what to do with their money once, and leave it there for a long time. Faced with that reality, the most profitable strategy for a mutual fund company can be to simply take risks in the hope of gaining high short-term returns. Win this high-return lottery and you can draw many investors from whom you will earn fees for decades. Big families of funds can start new funds regularly, each with a different risk strategy. For the companies, it’s like buying many lottery tickets. It doesn’t matter for the company if many of the funds are clunkers as long as they end up with a few near the top of the performance rankings. For consumers of these funds, though, it’s a losing proposition.

Educating consumers to be better purchasers seems a sensible idea, but an example from recent history illustrates the problem with that. For a long time, the simple investment advice given to consumers has been “buy an index fund.” Index funds are such standardized products — mirroring the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index does not require much management — that just about all of them were initially low cost while offering wonderful diversification.

Consumers have been buying index funds, and the market has responded by providing hundreds of them. Nearly all E.T.F.s are index funds.

But the market has also responded by charging high fees for this standardized product. In 2004, Ali Hortacsu and Chad Syverson, economists at the University of Chicago, found that index funds had as much variability in fees as their more labor-intensive actively managed counterparts. And these fees are nothing to be scoffed at — paying 1 percent more every single year in fees can compound over a lifetime to noticeably lower returns.

Initially sound rules of thumb create niches for bad products — like expensive index funds — that dilute the value of the advice. In short, the market responds to education with attempts to subvert it. Any simple advice tends to have an Achilles’ heel, and markets are good at finding it.

Why not rely on financial advice? There certainly seems to be a yearning for good advice. Last year, I posted a message on Twitter. “Want financial advice?” it said, adding that “@haroldpollack gives it free ... in index card form.” I included Mr. Pollack’s card containing nine pieces of simple advice, such as, “Never buy or sell an individual security. The person on the other side knows more about this stuff than you do.”

The popularity of that tweet shows the thirst for advice.

But while there is a large market for it, financial advice poses many risks.

In one study that I conducted with the economists Markus Noth at Hamburg University and Antoinette Schoar at M.I.T., we tried to quantify the quality of advice on the market. We did this by sending mystery shoppers to financial advisers. Our shoppers received very bad advice, by any measure. They were told to put their money into highly nondiversified portfolios that were also expensive. That’s the worst of both worlds: high risk and low returns. Perhaps most shocking was when our shoppers started with portfolios that were well diversified and inexpensive. Even in those cases, they were told to switch to options that were clearly worse.

But this is not meant to impugn all advisers. The study examined advisers who did not charge clients directly. Their advice was “free,” but under current rules, their advice only had to meet a very low standard — it only had to be “suitable” in a broad sense of that word. So it is O.K., legally, for these advisers to steer you to products that they profit from.

Advisers who explicitly charge for their advice are held to a higher standard. The Department of Labor has recently proposed a rule to require what is known as a fiduciary standard for advice on retirement accounts. At the moment, though, the rules are loose.

If you’re seeking advice, ask yourself one simple question: “If I’m not paying for this adviser, where are they getting their money?” If you don’t know the answer, you may have a problem.


Can we do anything? Regulations requiring that all advisers have a fiduciary duty to their advisees would be a terrific start. But we can do more.

Even if we receive good financial advice, following it can be hard: Saving more and consuming less is on par with going to the gym more and eating less. Some people can do it easily. Many can’t.

A recent study from Ideas42, a behavioral science nonprofit that I helped to start, showed that timely reminders and programs with good default choices can help ensure that good advice is followed. People in well-designed experimental programs who are given sound advice and plenty of reminders tend to save more. We can start more such programs. And in the investment market itself, better standards could make our lives better. When you buy a USB drive or a Wi-Fi router for your computer, for example, you may not really know how they work but you can assume that they will work with each other, because the industry has adopted standards to make sure that this happens. Imagine the nightmare of shopping for electronics products that were incompatible, or that had different names. Standardization is what allows uninformed consumers to shop intelligently for complex products.

For mutual funds, better standards and better labels could simplify choice. For example, suppose the label “Standard S&amp;P 500 Index Fund” was widely used to mean that the fund satisfied certain criteria about transparent pricing, low management fees and limits on trading costs. Consumers buying this fund would know what they were getting.

Firms would be free to introduce new, innovative funds, just as an electronics company can introduce new products that are not USB compatible. The restrictions would only prevent products from claiming to be something they are not.

What’s to be done now? You are on your own, unfortunately.

But I can tell you what I did. I chose a target retirement fund. With these funds, you simply decide on a target retirement year. As you age — and move closer to the target date — these funds automatically shift their holdings from riskier stocks to less risky bonds.

As with the simple advice “buy index funds,” this is also imperfect. If everyone starts buying target date funds, or life-cycle funds, how long before these terms attract companies that create expensive and not-so-effective products? In fact, it may have happened already. As Pierluigi Balduzzi and Jonathan Reuter found and reported in a recent paper, some target date funds may already be taking an expansive view of what it means to invest in equities: They seem to produce a wide range of returns and risks across the year. As a result, I was careful to verify a few things about the fund I chose. First, I made sure that the stocks held by the fund were contained in a simple, broad-based index such as the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index or the Russell 2000. Second, I verified that the costs were very low: The annual fees came to less than 0.2 percent. If the fees aren’t obvious, or if they are much higher than this, watch out.

Even armed with this knowledge, there were hiccups. First, choosing the retirement date raised existential quandaries. Since these funds come in increments of five years (2025, 2030 and so on) I ended up choosing two dates to leave me with mental wiggle room. (“I’m not that close to retirement,” I told myself, choosing one fund. “I might want to retire earlier,” I said, choosing another.)

Then I developed a second problem: I was afraid that picking only one kind of fund was imprudent. The economists Shlomo Benartzi at U.C.L.A. and Richard Thaler at the University of Chicago refer to the urge to buy many kinds of funds as “naïve diversification.” One fund can be enough if it’s diversified: What feels like one basket is really a great many baskets.

Overcoming this final hurdle was satisfying. I experienced the kind of euphoria usually reserved for major accomplishments.

The biggest lesson, I realized, was one that faces me all of the time: The biggest cost of fear is paralysis.

It is easy to make a mistake in choosing investments. But in an effort to avoid an error, I had been making an even bigger error. As I procrastinated, my money was uninvested and earning zero returns.

That, surely, is not the path to a happy retirement.

My allocation:

**Bonds** 36%

* 9% GNMA MBS - *VFIIX*

* 9% Int Term Government - *VSIGX*

* 9% Int Term Corporate - *VICSX*

* 9% Int Term Tax-Exmpt - *VWITX*

**Stocks** 51%

* 9% US Large Cap - *VLCAX*

* 9% US Mid Cap - *VIMAX*

* 9% US Small Cap - *VSMAX*

* 9% Intl Developed - *VTMGX*

* 9% Emerging Markets - *VEMAX*

* 6% International Small Cap - *VFSVX*

**Real Estate** 13%

* 8% US REITs - *VGSLX*

* 5% International REITs - *VGXRX*

Currently dollar-cost averaging without any market timing. Annual December rebalance.

I'm younger-ish, have no debt, padded savings account, and a long time horizon, though I suffer from health problems and have less trustworthy employment that doesn't allow me to take on as much risk as regular people my age (thus the savings and healthy 36% in bonds). REITs and some bonds are in tax-deferred account.

Not a believer of long-term bonds at the moment, and short term are piddly, so I'm leaning into int term. Spoke with a financial advisor about the fact that my MBS bonds and REITs might be overweighting real estate, and he said it's not that big of a deal. Also I considered giving more weight to LargeCaps since SmallCaps and MidCaps have higher correlation, but in multiple www.portfoliovisualizer.com backtests, the even split into Large/Mid/Small continued to be better in the long run.

My question is, without the benefits of the extra leverage, and without having to be forcibly locked into some time horizon restricting liquidation, how is this a different animal from any other ETF? Also, does this seem like a sensible option for a high risk investor, or is it extremely unlikely that this can beat a classic buy and hold strategy of the S&amp;P500?",20

15-07-13,3d3pdc,"Hi Reddit, I am starting a investment club at my university, but I need some tips?","Hi people of Reddit, several students and i have started an investment club at our college, or at least we are trying to. Coming from a non target school, several individuals and I want to break into the investment banking industry. 

Before you say impossible, I want to let you know that anything is achievable through hard work and persistence.  I am at the final step of getting the club created but there are no professors at my school willing to advise our club. I have asked and tried persuading every single finance and business professor at my university. You may not believe it, but I have contacted every single finance, accounting, and economics professor at my school. 

I'm going crazy because not one professor will take a look at our club constitution. It's hard to believe that every single professor does not have the time to advise a club. So what I want to know from you is, have you ever tried creating a club in college but wasn't able to finish that one last step? I'm at the very last stepping stone to creating this club but there are no professors willing to take up the opportunity. Should I start asking biology and chemistry professors? Hell, I'll even take the janitor as an advisor if I can get this club started.

15-07-13,3d58vv,Looking for a critique on my investment allocation (should I rebalance?),"    Total invested: $152,532.33
    Age: 30 by EOY

I've maxed out my 401k investment and ROTH IRA investment for 2015.

The last time I balanced my 401k was around Oct/Nov of 2014.  Not sure if I should be looking to do so again, or just keep it as-is for now.  What made me think of rebalacing my 401k now is issues with Greece, China, and possible effects of bonds with Fed rulings this year?  More curiosity than anything at this point.

Wondering what people think... the worst behind them and they will build a base around this 2.00 level and the new technology will reap rewards and help turn things around for them in the next couple of quarters?

15-07-12,3d1jpk,Possible to circumvent SEP rules with new company?,"Hello, throwaway due to potential controversial nature of this post. Forgive me if I overstep.

I have a successful company with about 30 employees. In '14 I saw we were on course for a lot of profit, and planned to open a SEP Ira in order to shelter as much $ as possible. Unfortunately, I later learned that SEP required me to contribute an equal amount to all eligible employees which would have been a substantial amount of money. Before anyone cries that I should pay my employees more, i'll have you know I full cover their medical, dental, &amp; vision insurance. I pay vacations, quarterly bonuses, and sick days. Additionally, the lowest paid grunt worker makes $16/hr here in the south. They are compensated VERY well.

I have a new company launching this year, completely separate from the original in which I will be the sole member. I plan on making an S-Corp election and taking a salary from this company as well. Is it possible to set up the SEP plan under this new company, allowing me to stash the maximum deferred amount without having to contribute to anyone else? For the year '14, I will likely be the only ""employee"".

Any help or guidance you have surrounding these rules would be great, as the rules are (not sure if by design) difficult to navigate. 

Again, just looking to see if I am within the ruleset to stash $30-50k tax deferred using a separate company through SEP IRA without having it affect my first company.",1

15-07-13,3d5ih7,Is investing in REITs risky if I expect interest rates to rise?,"I've been talking to my dad about a few REITs that seem to hold properties my dad thinks are valuable.  He feels that the REITs hold solid assets, but I am personally hesitant to invest in any REITs, regardless of what they hold, because I think (plz correct me if you disagree) interest rates will rise and therefore the value of the REITs will fall.  

Is this fair? Does any of this make sense?  Is it actually safe to invest in REITs?  

Any advice relating to REITs and interest rates would be appreciated.  Thanks.",7

15-07-13,3d5k74,"What's wrong with using margin?","I now many investors don't recommend using margin, but I'm not sure why. 

There are many stocks and etfs out there with average 5-year annual returns well above my bank's annual interest fee for using margin. 

And if I use 1:2 margin, then I just need to find an sector-tracking etf or large-cap stock that has very little chance of losing half its value...which doesn't seem that hard to do. 

I know the the 2008-2009 crash reduced many sector-tracking etfs and large-cap stocks to below 50% of their 2006 value, but I believe many view that the 2008-2009 crash as a once-in-a-generation/black swan event considering the previous crash of similiar magnitude was back in the 1930s. And except for the reintroduction of the glass steagall act, our financial system has learned from the crash and become stronger and more alert. So I don't think we'll see a crash of similair magnitude any time soon. 

So if you can find a stock or etf that consistently makes more than the margin fee, and if you still leave room to withstand normal bear markets, what's wrong with using margin? ",8
15-07-13,3d5kb0,Options question," So basically, I've been hearing a lot of optimism in Microsoft, not to mention the chart is showing a lot of signs on wanting to move upward. And I've also been learning about options. That being said, I've got a quick question. So let's say I purchase September $52.50 calls for MSFT (10 contracts). Currently, they're only $0.08, or $8 per contract. That being said, I feel it'd probably be likely that even with a rally after ER, Microsoft could fall short of the option's strike price of $52.50. But let's say the price spiked say mid July after ER and went up to $50. How much would my contract most likely be worth and would it be possible to turn around and sell it back to the market for a profit rather than exercising it? Sorry, still new to all of this. But wondering if this sounds like a decent plan.",1

15-07-13,3d4dqx,"How many brokerage accounts do you have? I think I have way too many for someone in my position, and am looking on advice about consolidating.","5 years ago out of college I started a job with a 401(k) at Vanguard. In addition to my 401(k), I started investing personal money in ETF's with Vanguard. Around the same time, I opened a Scottrade account so I could do some easy trades. (In retrospect, I probably should have just done that with Vanguard).

My company was purchased by a larger company, and my 401(k) was transferred to Aon Hewitt, but I still had my personal Vanguard account. Around this time I was reading about DRIP stocks, and started a DRIP with McDonald's stock, investing money each month, which was done through Computershare. I'm no longer purchasing the stock (except for with my dividend payments). So I have a Computershare account with McDonald's stock.

I quit that job, went to grad school, then started a new job, which uses Fidelity as the 401(k).  So now I have accounts with Fidelity, Aon Hewitt, Vanguard, Scottrade, and Computershare.

Clearly this is excessive, and I want to consolidate. First order will be to transfer Aon Hewitt to Fidelity and probably send the Computershare shares to either Fidelity or Scottrade.

I like Vanguard because of their ETFs-but if I transfer them to a personal account on Fidelity, I can still purchase the Vanguard ETFs on Fidelity's account right? Additionally, with Scottrade, should I just send everything to Fidelity, or is there a benefit to having a brokerage like Scottrade for stock trading over Fidelity?

I guess my main question is whether or not you would just transfer everything to the Fidelity account or not, if you were in my shoes.

15-07-13,3d4fju,Online Police Verification for passport Making,Good News for those who want to make New passport or Passport renewal. Initially to make New passport or Renew Passport you can apply online in Tatkaal and get the passport in ten days. In this process the police verification was done later on .This police verification is done in old fashion in which the police do the physical verification by visit at the applicant place and do the process of verification. Normally this process is very time consuming and full of troubles. So the Government of India is trying to remove all this time consuming and full of trouble process in police verification for making the passport.

15-07-13,3d4lf7,Thoughts into my current allocation?,"Any thoughts into my current allocation? (late 30s, married, single family income with 1 toddler, goal is long term savings, time horizon is probably around 15 years, i own a house with large mortgage at 3.8%, 27 yrs left, trying to prepay mortgage so that my principal payment equals my interest payment, i have a decent risk tolerance, but i have a decent sized stock portfolio that is more risky than i would like to admit, so i would like to keep the below funds somewhat safe (ideally good risk adjusted return), no other debts.

Question is primarily for my fund allocations for 401k and Vanguard (Retirement savings) - thus far these make up a pretty small portion of my entire portfolio (~30%, most of the others are in mostly tech stocks some that are buy and hold, others i trade in and out of, but im guessing eventually most of my assets will be in funds with a small amount in stocks to 'play' with, below these are the funds i am actively contributing on a biweekly basis)

Fund Name - current contribution % - portion of current portfolio

401k @ TRowe Price

PRDGX - Dividend Growth - 6% - 2.5%

PRFDX - Equity Income - 6% - 2.5%

PREIX - Equity Index 500 - 6% - 2.5%

PRNEX - New Era - 2% - .85%

PRNHX - New Horizons 6% - 2.5%

TRRDX 0 target retirement 2040 - 0% 1.25% (not currently contributing)

OTCFX - Small Cap Stock - 2% - .85%

PRSVX - Small Cap Value - 6% - 2.5%

TRVLX - Value - 6%- 2.5%


Vanguard - Investment

VDIGX - Vanguard Dividend Growth - 17% - 2.5%

VWIGX - International Growth - 12% - 1.7%

NAESX - Small Cap Index - 12% - 1.7%

VWELX - Wellington fund - 17% - 3.1%

I realize there is probably a bit of overlap in there (i set these up independently without thinking about how they interact with each other, and until i actually calculated the % i actually am contributing right now to each fund, i didnt think of how much omre i am actually contributing to my vanguard over my 401k) - i am trying to put of most of my excess savings into the vanguard fund - so it is seeing a higher % contribution.

are there any funds i should remove? anything i have excess risk/exposure to? For all intents and purposes, these are for retirement or long term savings. I also have a large cash position that i am DCA'ing into the vanguard funds. But if there are better funds or additional funds (vanguard ideally) i would be open to other ideas.. otherwise i have just started DCAing into the wellington fund(for no good reason other than the fact i think it is a good 'all around' fund)",1

Long term bearish; the austerity they pass will shit all over their economy. Sale of assets further worsens their ability to pay. Germans want Greece to crash so hard. They want all other nations to see this is what happens. so much for eu unity. ",2

If you have at least the slightest bit of knowledge about the stock market, go ahead and look up ""pennystock millionaire"" (or anything involving pennystocks in general). Reading the comments really proves to me why so many people lose in the stock market. 

Here is just a few I could find: http://i.imgur.com/oK0pZHu.png

The sad part is most of these people are much older than me and are acting like 13 year olds with no concept of anything. At the same time it is pretty interesting to see complete newbies thought process of the pennystock world. Most of these people are inspired by the money and not actually by trading itself, which is why I have such a hard time reading them. I personally started out with watching youtube videos on pennystocks because I thought pennystocks were cool (but extremely hard). Turns out I was right.

What do you guys think?",1
15-07-14,3d7yne,New job with 403(b) plan..No debts making roughly 50k a year.,"So I am 23 years old recent college grad with no debt and will be living at home till I go to grad school in about 3 years. Grad school will be expensive (100k) so I need to save for that as well.                

I currently have 21k in the bank. 16k of that is a work agreement incentive for two years, so since I just started working, I think that money is not technically mine until I acclimate to the new work environment. Anywho, I plan on putting in a lot of money (possibly as much as I can) now that I am young. Though I am not sure if I should use the 403(b) plan in which my employer will match 5% of my compensation but I will not be vested 100% till 5 years. In 3 years I may very well quit working there and will only be vested 60%. Should I just open up my own Roth IRA and contribute mainly to that?                  

Ill be making roughly 50k a year and after grad school in about 6 years 125k a year.             

I am looking to invest for retirement and also maybe a short term savings account for grad school. I'd prefer risks to be low.           

Literally no debts and my car is paid off. I am super disciplined with money and have no problem leaving it in a place without touching it.",6

I was a pretty low-level employee at the time but I believe many of us were classified as ""insiders"" so that leadership could be more open with us in emails, communications, etc. 

6 months later, I'm now interested in buying some stock in that company personally. Are there any insider trading concerns with doing this? Is there a certain amount of time you need to wait before it is okay? While I knew some secret stuff at the time, at this point I don't know anything that isn't already public. Is it still risky anyway?

15-07-13,3d6q44,Getting started in the UK.,"Hello everyone,

I'm new to this sub and am also pretty new to investing and would like some tips on getting started in the UK.

The main problem for me is finding a broker. A lot of people here seem to recommend RobinHood but unfortunately they haven't opened in the UK yet - are there any reputable 0% commission companies like this that will accept people from the UK? If not, what brokers can you recommend?

I'd also like to know how much you recommend a beginner should start with. Obviously, I know the rule that you should never invest any money you can't afford to lose, but I'm looking for an actual figure here.

I'm very big on learning from books too, so has anyone got any absolute essential reading for a beginner in the stock market?

Thanks to anyone who helps :)

EDIT: I just found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/20rpj8/so_you_want_to_learn_about_stocks/) which answers a lot of what I asked (thanks, OP!), so now I'm mainly looking for recommended UK brokers.",2

1. Is it possible to be successful starting with only 100-200$? Thats all I have.

15-07-14,3d78a9,Question regarding Index IUL,"Currently 24 years old. Currently investing 150 dollars a month into a Index Universal Life Policy. Basically life insurance.

It costs 50 dollars a month for maintenance so I'm really only investing in 100 dollars a month. The goal is to put money into it until it receives high enough dividends to cover the cost. I'm planning to keep it for the next 15~30 years as a retirement vehicle. Currently 24 years old.

15-07-14,3d8vt9,Best long-term stocks options?,"Hi all, I am new here and was sitting down with a friend of mine who had a big background in the stock market.

It inspired me to write a 10 year plan. Aside from my main business (media advertising) I wanted to allocate a certain amount of savings to stock options. My other main investment
is in property and I am aiming to build up a portfolio. I'm 28 by the way.

I was originally looking at investing in start ups but my mind has drastically changed after some horror stories of friends of mine.

After researching this, my best option is to essentially invest in long term stock options with a steady growth, and essentially a reasonable yield. I haven't decided if I will ever sell in this period but just to give you a hindsight of what I am going to put in:

2015: £2,500
2016: £5,000
2017: £10,000
2018: £15,000

2022: nil. 
2023: £40,000
2024: nil.
2025: £100,000

Disney
Apple
Ebay
Procter and Gamble
Microsoft
Netflix
PepsiCo

I am unsure as if its wise to sell after 10 years? e.g. if I buy in disney today and in ten years I sell? Or is it better to just hold onto these stock until 2035 and perhaps sell half etc.

* Am I just WAY off on everything and need to reconsider what I'm even thinking?

My personal favorite, ""Bubble.com"" was a perfect (and zany) account of the Dot-com bubble - all written before the market crashed in 2000! Don't expect a ton of financial forecasting, though.

15-07-14,3d9hfb,PM mining stocks are near 12 year lows. Time to buy?,"Remarkably, gold and silver prices have been hammered in the last several weeks despite the turmoil in Greece and Chinese markets. In addition to a decrease in spot prices, PM mining indexes are nearing 12 year lows as investors flee mining stocks. Many miners are the same price as they were when gold was $500.

Assuming you are bullish on gold, this certainly seems like the time to become invested if you aren't already. I'm looking for some low cost producers right now that are able to weather bearish prices long term or indefinitely.

Two I've already come across are Yamana (AUY) and Sprott (SII). Yamana has several low cost mines and also gets 30% of its revenue from the copper it gets as a by product. Sprott is an asset manager that specializes in commodities like gold and silver. It's managed to keep good earnings with it's asset management business and makes loans to mining companies in bad need of credit. In addition to high interest rates, Sprott also collects warrants from the miners to buy stock and would make a killing if the market rebounds. 

Anyone else have any good miners or gold tied companies you're looking at?",21

- Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Class - 53%

http://www.dailywealth.com/2467/guide-for-selling-stocks-from-the-father-of-value-investing

Ben Graham suggested, ""Either sell once you're up 50% or sell in two years, whichever happens first.""

The above was based on buying businesses with PE below 10 and obviously strategies should change with the times and market, but I found it pretty interesting.

I've holding some pretty decent winners ($UA, $FB, $AAPL) but find that knowing when to reduce my position is difficult. I love the picks and I think they'll continue to grow, but will they settle for periods where taking profits and putting the money to work elsewhere would be more beneficial?

I also haven't heard of this strategy before but curious what people think. Say you have $100k and you look for short term opportunities. You find one, invest all $100k, the stock goes up 5%, you sell your initial $100k investment, and let the $5k in profits ride for eternity.

I'm 20 and I currently don't have a part time job, but I'm planning on getting one soon to work at around classes.
I currently have $5,000 cash (not much, I know) but I want to get started on investing early. I currently have about $10,000 in loans that won't be building up any interest until 6 months after I graduate (in two years). What I would like to do is go ahead and put $1,000 of my cash into a Roth IRA and after getting a job, begin to contribute to it regularly as well as saving to pay off debt.
My question is this; is it better for me to go ahead and start saving money for retirement (by maybe 2055), or is it better for me to save purely to pay off debts for now and worry about a Roth IRA later. Thanks everyone!",4

15-07-14,3d9wr6,"Opinions on using a Collar Option income for stock I'd like to hold for a year then sell?","I am involved in an Employee Stock Purchase Program where I get my company's stock at a 10% discount.  If I sell that stock within the first year, it's taxed at my regular income rate, and if I hold it for a year it's taxed much lower.  Currently, I just sell all the stock as I get it and take the 10% raise on the amount I'm allowed to buy (it's basically an overall 1.5% pay increase, not counting taxes).  Note that I do NOT like holding my company's stock because it mostly stays the same and doesn't really have a lot of upward or downward momentum...I prefer to put the money into other investments like indexes.

I'd like to stretch this money a bit more, by putting a [collar](http://www.theoptionsguide.com/the-collar-strategy.aspx) on the stock such that the cost of buying the put is less than the money I make on selling the call.  This makes sure that I never drop below my initial investment (that's the idea here, I'll likely set the puts a higher than a 10% drop).  This will net me a small income for a year, (I'm ignoring dividends here, which is roughly 2.5% for my company), then if the options expire worthless I'll sell it in a year's time without too much downside risk.  (Note I'm holding enough of the stock to use options.)

Here are my expected (possible) outcomes, note I'm ""neutral-to-slightly bullish"" (the stock isn't very volatile) on where the stock is going when using this strategy:

1.  **Stock reaches PUTS strike price**:  This is the downside.  I use the PUTS, take less money than the original 10% (but still more than what I put in) while still paying normal income tax.
2.  **Stock reaches CALL strike price**:  No matter when this happens, I consider this a win compared to selling it immediately.  It doesn't matter if it goes higher after that, because I was going to sell the stock below the strike price anyway, and I've made &gt;10% profit.
3.  **Options expire worthless, stock is about the same or higher**:  I collect income, I do it again until I've held the stock for a year, then sell the stock (or keep going, either way is fine).
4.  **Options expire worthless, stock is too low to run the same thing again**:  This is downside, but not as bad as #1.  I collected a small income from the options, but it's no longer profitable to do this again.  I'll sell the stock (or hold it with a stop loss sell order at the PUTS price to see if it goes back up).

Questions for you all:

1.  If I do this strategy, should I use long duration options, or a bunch of short duration options?  I think the longer duration so I don't get eaten alive by trading fees, right?
2.  Is there any caveats/downside I'm not considering?
3.  Overall does this seem like a good strategy to strech a little more out of it for a year rather than just immediately selling the stock when I get it?

Thanks!",4

15-07-15,3dbtb2,My take on $FIT.,"##About the product

Fitbit's market share is near the highest it'll ever be. More and more competitors are entering the space and while FIT has brand power, I'm willing to bet the larger players (Garmin, Apple, Jawbone, that Shia Labeouf one) will erode that shine.

FIT is great in that it allows you to connect your fitness data with Aria (The FIT scale) which no competitors does right now. However, Apple also has a great ecosystem for their Apple Watch to flourish in. FIT will try to build similar features, such as texting, into their devices, but I believe few will find such features useful. Texting from a watch will be impossible especially with lackluster voice recognition software. 

While Fitbit works with some great apps ( http://www.fitbit.com/apps ) Google Fit / Apple will easily overcome this as developers flock to their platform. Not to mention the potential for Microsoft to dominate in terms of apps, with their one OS, one app store.

##About the numbers

With a PE of almost 100, I think Fitbit is absolutely ridiculously valued right now. Their profit margins are slim and could expand greatly to provide a better PE (especially compared to Apple Watch where profit margins are like 50% vs 18%)

A market cap of $10 billion is almost obscene. Last year the market cap for ALL fitness trackers was $11 billion. In fairness, Fitbit's market share was 70% in 2014, and rose to 85% in 2015 while the overall wearables market also grew. The question is, will this growth rate continue? And I strongly believe that answer is no. The future growth in the fitness wearables industry will come from the upper middle class who will be more focused on quality (Apple) than value (Fitbit) or from the athletic community, who will value Nike's Fuelband over Fitbit.

##Some other notes

Fitbit is in a class of it's own right now, it's the first fitness wearables company to go public, and for that reason I think a lot of investors are getting too hyped up about it. The massive growth since IPO is perhaps warranted, but could result in an overvaluation.

##My play

Shorting a hype stock is kind of like sticking your dick in a blender,  it feels good when it's filled with mango juice until your sister turns on the blender and you have to go to the hospital and get reconstructive surgery on the tip of your penis and can't have sex for weeks on end with serious pain. I plan to wait and see if FIT gets truly out of hand and overvalued. If it does, I'm looking at pre-earnings puts. In the meantime, I'm keeping an eye on cheap calls for a quick flip.

15-07-14,3da7ka,The buzz about FIT (Fitbit),"I don't know if I'm just completely ignorant or completely alone in thinking the way I feel about fitbit but I would love it if you guys shared your thoughts on it as well.

To me, I do not understand the way FIT is going up and up and up and they are expecting it to keep going up.   I look at a company like that and think, ""They are making good products accompanied with good software, but they have like a very limited product line.""
I feel like I can agree with people that they have good stuff.  So I'm not just against them all together or w/e, but I see a company with ONE niche market like that not lasting forever.  I see that the importance of maintaining good health is more important than ever and is rising more and more and that Fitbit also can capitalize on that market.  I see it as good but I see them as so limited.  

I think I'm also wondering how a company like Facebook can open themselves for public trading and just drop like crazy when they have WAAAY more market than a company like fitbit yet fitbit can double in the first day and can keep rising since?  

I just think I don't understand something completely and I don't want to feel like a stupid idiot and I feel like I must be seeing something wrong if everyone else is seeing something right.

Also, someone I know that owns one (who knows nothing about the stock market) told me to invest in it when i mentioned they were going to be publicly trading.  I didn't because it was an opening day and that's risky and the only things I really know about them is that their fitbit products are good, but that is all they do.  They have like 5+ products and I felt super weird about it.

15-07-14,3dajjf,The time for AVXL is NOW,"Here's a little background (ELI5) for those of you who are not familiar with this stock: 

- Anavex is focusing primarily on drugs that combat Alzheimer's disease and Epilepsy. One of their most exciting drugs in their pipeline, Anavex 2-73, recently demonstrated very strong results in Phase 2a Alzheimer's trials. Their drug Anavex PLUS was even MORE encouraging - this drug is a combination of Anavex 2-73 and Aricept, the leading Alzheimer's drug currently in market. If Anavex PLUS is successful, it is believed that there is lower clinical trial risk since Aricept has already been approved by the FDA. 

- This stock used to be over $5 a little more than 5 years ago. They underwent some changes in management that hurt the company substantially. The current leadership team has really been turning things around, and has a TON of experience building up smaller bios. 

- The major catalyst shareholders have been waiting for is the expected release of 2-73 Phase 2a data in September of this year. However, just recently it was announced that Anavex will be presenting early data at a massive upcoming Alzheimer's conference on July 22nd. MANY big names will be in attendance. Investors are very excited to hear some positive news...why would Anavex choose to present at one of the largest Alzheimer's conferences ahead of their scheduled data release if didn't have something good to say?

It's still a risk but the potential for reward is HUGE. Alzheimer's is estimated to be a $10b market and any promising news will send this company soaring. On top of that, this is one of Jbem777's picks since March, and he continues to hold many shares (and we've all seen what happened with his other picks like PTBI and TPIV!)

15-07-15,3dc2yt,$BGMD - discussion of science,"I'm not invested in $BGMD yet, but the threads on this forum have perked my interest about this company, stock, and Gal-3. I've been reading through past threads and saw a resident (castalmond) discussing the science behind and applications for Gal-3 and I would like to discuss his comment in a new thread since that one is a month old and buried. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Castalmond:**

""I'm not too impressed with the predictive value of the test. Sensitivity 62.9%, specificity 90%. Most commonly used marker right now is BNP, which has a higher sensitivity but lower specificity than gal-3. IMO specificity is less important (if someone comes in with clinical signs of CHF, i.e SOB, weight gain, reduced urine output, then why do you need a confirmatory test besides echocardiogram?).

With the current medical landscape focusing on cost cutting, practically I don't see a good use for another CHF marker. The question that doctors will ask when ordering a test is, ""will it change management?"" In that regard, will a high gal-3 change beta-blocker, afterload reducing, or diuretic therapy? Dry weight is probably a more accurate measure of CHF exacerbation anyway.

Can this marker be used to find undiagnosed HFpEF? Probably, but will insurances cover screening everyone in the population, or do you need to have certain risk factors (high cholesterol, obesity, diabetes, etc)? It might end up being like prostate cancer screening with a PSA - the false positives are too high and may result in more unnecessary tests.

The elephant in the room is NT-proBNP, which is a much better diagnostic marker and predictor of mortality than BNP. Most institutions in the United States have been relying on BNP due to the cost of NT-proBNP (some think it's because medicaid doesn't want to find more CHF patients, which will drive up medical costs), but it's gaining traction slowly. This test has been widely available in Europe for several years.

tl;dr Is this marker a better diagnostic tool than available markers? Will it change medical management? Will insurances pay for it?""

&amp;nbsp;

**My thoughts:**

I'm not invested in this BGMD...yet, but I'm doing my DD and interested in discussing the points you bring up.

To me, when presented with these symptoms, first thing I think of is CHF, and running a BNP test and having it come back positive will confirm the diagnosis, but if it comes back negative doesn't tell me anything, it doesn't mean its not happening and doesn't let me make a conclusion. As a resident, you know that BNP only elevates during exacerbation of CHF and not during the interim.

I'm actually very impressed by the predictive value of this test. I love higher specificity when looking at tests...it lets me rule in a disease. Higher sensitivity only let me rule out diseases. Hypothetically, if we are evaluating healthy people, sensitivity would be more important and BNP wins out. However, with the aging population of baby boomers, and you and I know everyone over 65 has hypertension and heart failure, specificity is more important when diagnosing unhealthy people (ie. Gal-3 wins).

However, in the end we may be comparing apples to oranges here. BNP is used for diagnosing systolic heart failure (HFrEF). For those who don't know, in patients with HFrEF ejection fraction is decreased. Gal-3 is most likely going to be used for diagnosing diastolic heart failure (HFpEF). In patients with HFpEF, ejection fraction is preserved, the heart is stiff and fibrotic (not dilating) and thus not producing BNP to be detected.

Yeah, I know any new tests will be hard to get doctors to adopt it, but if it is going to be part of automatic screenings, I think it might be an important and in demand test for our aging baby boomers and you know the whole big push for preventative medicine/screening blah blah blah (one for Gal-3). However, in my opinion systolic heart failure is more prevalent so that's one for BNP. 

And oh, irrelevant but something you brought up, I think its untrue what you said about medicaid and not wanting to find CHF, everyone older has HF, and I know only the VA runs NT-proBNP... all the regular hospitals use BNP",2

Last year this mutual fund was down like 7 percent, adviser says its going to recover. On this theory we take a portion of the over all profit from the mutal fund and take the discounted mutal fund at a discount YTD its down about 5 percent and doesn't seem to be doing well again. 

My financial adviser keeps telling me don't worry about it, you're daughters got another 9 years. Her portfolio as a whole is up around 8 percent trust me.

I know I have time, but this mutual fund seems like a dog. When do I pull the string and say enough is enough. As it is, I don't like having an adviser at all, but it was part of the settlement agreement ( lawsuit) with very very stringent terms. As it is, that's why I can't even say the mutual fund or give any more specifics. I am a big fan of no load index funds, but this guy is the fiduciary ordered by the court, I have a little bit of control.

15-07-15,3dcoun,"[ADVICE] 19 year old college student, just got a job. How/what can i learn about investing over the next year that can help me invest wisely now &amp; forever?","Hi guys,

So I just got a part time job for the next year thats going to be giving me more money than I've had before. I want to give enough pertinent information as possible in hopes of getting some advice regarding how i should go about: saving/spending this money so that it lasts and im not just wasting, possibly investing in something so that i can increase the amount of money i have, and other tips and pieces of wisdom you could impart on me.

So a little about me and this job: I am currently 19 years old, about to enter my sophomore year in college. I live at home and commute to school and most of the expenses ( all of the major ones like tuition, insurance, etc.) are paid for by my parents. I do pay for my own food and recreational activities, but i try to make lunches from home during the school year and not overspend on clothes, movies and other stuff like that. I recently got a job thats related to my major that i will be working part time around my school schedule for the next year. I'm being paid hourly, and I've calculated that I'll be making a total of approximately $10,000 over the course of the next 11-12 months. Right now i have exactly $1,000 dollars in my checking account, and this money is going to be directly deposited in to this account.

Since im blessed to be so privileged, i really want to take advantage of making a good amount of money this early in my life. I've heard numerous people say how important it is to start saving and being responsible with money from an early age, so i thought this would be the perfect opportunity to learn since i don't have to support myself just yet.

I would love advice on how i should go about trying to make this money last. I obviously wont be getting it all at once, but how should i be splitting this money up incrementally between food/fun and just putting it away in the bank. Also, i wanted to start learning about investments and different types of investing in hopes of trying to invest in the stock market next year with $X,000 I'll have. I also posted in r/personalfinance something similar to this , but any advice i can get is worth it in my opinion. What books/websites/resources can i check out to learn about investing or personal finance tips? What are some things you wish you knew at 19 that can help me in my 20s?

I hope this is enough information regarding my situation for you to give me some advice, tips, personal stories/lessons/failures you'd be willing to share. How can i become knowledgeable about investing over the next year so that i can maybe invest some of this money, or money later on in my life.  Let me know if there is anything else you might need to know and id be happy to add that in. Thanks in advance!

15-07-15,3dengm,"China Trade- Here's a trade idea for everyone...high risk; higher reward.","I'm new to posting on reddit so I thought I would share a trade  idea as an early thx for joining the thread.

There's a lot of discussion on China and taking advantage of the volatility.   Here's a way to capitalize on the volatility while still being able to (somewhat) control your risk.

Here goes- Closed End Funds trade at a discount or premium to their Net Asset Value (NAV).   They do this because CEF's r dominated by retail players; because of supply and demand they drift away from the value of there underlying basket.   For more info on closed end plz read at cefa.com, they do a great job explaining...

CAF is a closed end fund that holds a basket of Chinese stocks.    CAF also historically trades about 5% under its NAV, which is common for CEF, some trade at a premium and others at a big discount but the overall avg of the space is -7 ish.    CAF closed last night at -28 discount!   So it's trading 28% less than its holdings.    The arb is to buy the CEF and sell the basket, but there all Chinese companies so how can we sell the basket???   

I ran a correlation analysis (and added other inputs) to value the results of my analysis.   I came out with 2 stocks that are a good hedge for CAF -- look at ASHR and XPP, these have a 77% and 71% correlation to CAF's NAV (not just CAF).    These stocks r slippery little guys but there's plenty of volume to get orders done, and they trade on US exchanges.

So there u have it new message board friends:
Buy CAF v. Short ASHR, XPP
Be careful - i should add (as CFA 2 candidate) this is not a trade suggestion, everyone has there own financial situation -- just wanted to point out where I see value.   And tell u about one of my positions :)

And it seems to correlate with good news... this means people using NYSE or NASDAQ can't trade?

But, I'm assuming, people can still trade this stock amongst themselves just fine, but on the main markets it's closed?

Is this supposed to help people from being scalped by price swings, does it help buyers or sellers in some way? Or does trading get halted over technical issues, like being unable to handle the volume of trades? Or is it a ""circuit-breaker"" that prevents too big a swing in an equities price before shutting it down?

Anyway, feeling a bit unhappy about trading halting because it would lock someone like me out, while I presume the big brokerage houses are happily trading the stock amongst themselves on a dark market.

15-07-15,3dcyki,Mattel stock is the best opportunity I have seen in years.,"Ask any questions you want, I will do everything I can to explain my thesis on this. I am a value investor at heart, and made major profits on the 2008 stock market crash and subsequent recovery. I have not seen a value as good as Mattel stock since that time. 

I first started accumulating shares a year ago, and since then have seen the price come down even more. There are 8 major analysts that follow Mattel, and 6 of them are bearish. Mattel had the top selling girls category for 50 years with Barbie until Frozen beat her last year. I do not believe that is going to happen again this year.

Mattel will report their 2nd quarter earnings this Thursday after the market closes, and when analysts see that the company has stopped losing sales, shares are going to go nuts. Goldman Sachs put a 1 year price target of $37 on this stock after the 1st quarter results, and I think it's going even higher than that.

Assuming Barbie returns to full speed this year, you will never be able to get a deal as good as you will get right now on their shares. 

The major argument that comes up is that Hasbro will do well with Star Wars this Christmas. Listen to me, Mattel and Hasbro are not in competition with each other. Mattel sells mostly girls and baby toys. Star Wars is not a concern. Hasbro is also obtaining the Disney Princess line, but that doesn't happen until after Christmas, and it was a small part of Mattel's sales anyway. ",24

Backtesting this portfolio appears to produce returns that are almost equivalent to holding pure SPY but with much less theoretical downside. I expect this number could be further improved by introducing rebalancing after stocks have run up hard and exceed 25% of the portfolio. Essentially you'd be capturing stocks' upside and stashing your profits in safe bonds.

I did a lot research on several stocks and after weeks of debate I finally decided on a stock. I called the advisor and said I wanted 200 shares of stock(~$13.5k), advisor said he will do that, and then proceded to tell me to sell some of my other stocks and put it in two of his mutual funds. After hesitation, I obliged thinking he knows a lot more than I do.  Well I just received the statement, and my jaw dropped when I saw he charged a $330 commission fee. I mean, all the the guy did was call it in.  I noticed there was another  $280 worth of hidden commissions from selling the other stocks. I'm somewhat content with that, but absolutely livid about the $330. Should I complain about this or is this standard?  If I would've known any of this I would've just taken out the 15k, put it in an online broker, and made the trade for free. ",106

Does this make sense and if so is it a reasonable strategy?


 I realise it will lower potential gains but hopefully lower potential losses as well and I'm aiming for a portfolio where I don't have to stress out about interest rate changes (as little as possible anyway)

fwiw I'm approaching 30, going to use cavendish to pick my tracker funds, and if it made sense to only pick one over the other that is what I'd prefer, and would probably reduce my percentage allocated to bonds

15-07-16,3di7ji,Ponzi Scheme Lands Real Estate Fraudster in Prison,"www.StockPromoters.com

James Ashby Moncure, 42, of Fredericksburg, Virginia was sentenced on Monday to more than five years in federal prison for scamming millions of dollars from investors who were under the impression they were investing in an office complex.

Originally facing up to 140 years, Moncure took a plea deal in February admitting to wire fraud and unlawful monetary transactions. The deal significantly reduced the amount of time he faced.

Charges against him stem from more than $12 million in investments received for development of the Quantico Corporate Center in North Stafford, Virginia. Mr. Moncure reportedly took the investment funds and used them for day-trading on stocks, options and other unauthorized transactions. He used some new investors’ money to pay previous investors in a Ponzi-like scheme that ended when he confessed his wrongdoing in an email to his victims in March 2014.

Along with sentencing Moncure to 65 months in prison for wire fraud and illegal monetary transactions, U.S. District Judge Henry Hudson ordered him to make full restitution. He admonished Moncure, saying his credibility was “zeroed out,” before sentencing him and ordering him to pay almost $8.3 million in restitution.

Moncure’s attorneys had asked for a sentence of two years’ home incarceration, saying Moncure cared about the investors and the Quantico project. Public defender Nia Vidal said Moncure simply “got in over his head” with other projects and used investor money to play the stock market in the hopes he could earn enough to pay them back.
 
But federal prosecutor Michael Gill told the court that Moncure “abused these people’s trust.”
 
“He had an addiction [to day trading] and he was feeding it with other people’s money,” actions that “wrecked the financial future” for many of the victims, Gill said.",1

15-07-16,3didaw,Netflix vs HBO,"In light of the Netflix earnings yesterday and the subsequent stock pop, I still fail to understand why people are so hot on Netflix stock. 

Currently, Netflix is valued at $50b and time warner (parent of HBO) is valued at $75b. HBO has more penetration (currently) and just flat out better content. Netflix has better technology but i don’t think much difference to consumers in the long run. 

And let's be honest... NFLX content is still second rate compared to HBO. If I were HBO, I wouldn't take NFLX lightly and I'm sure over the years they'll get even better content, but right now I would still much rather be able to watch Sopranos, The Wire, Curb Your Enthusiasm, True Detective, Game of Thrones, Silicon Valley, etc instead of a crappy season 4 of Arrested Development, and that show about a gangster in Iceland. I also cannot remember the last time there was a movie on Netflix that I was interested in, and they took away King of the Hill I just about lost it. 

Am I missing something about the ease of international expansion for TWC vs Netflix? Or something about the cost structure? I know HBO is still somewhat tied to cable providers, but I don't see that as being any more of a long-term hindrance to success than Netflix's 2nd rate content is to theirs. 

To me, as an investor, it comes down to would I rather own a a piece of Netflix at $50b, or a piece of TWC at $75b where you get HBO AND......

Stock Promoter Mitchell Adam, 47, of Vancouver, Canada pled guilty this week in a New Jersey court for his part in a scheme to artificially inflate the price of a purported oil company listed on the pink sheets, HPB Energy Corporation. He now faces five years in federal prison. Mr. Adam pled guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and mail fraud.

During a four month time frame in 2013, Prosecutors say that Adam conspired with attorney Adam Gottbetter and fellow promoter Kenneth Stevenson to drive up the price of HPBE by using matched trades, spam and offshore call centers. Traders that Gottbetter knew would carry out most of the market legwork, while Adam and Stevenson would carry out the pump side of the scheme through promotions. Law enforcement intervened before the promotions could take place.

The coconspirators did, however, obtain and conceal control of a significant portion of free-trading shares of the company's stock and allegedly planned to sell it at the fraudulently inflated prices.

Gottbetter pled guilty in September to conspiracy to commit securities and mail fraud as managing partner of Gottbetter &amp; Partners LLC. He was sentenced to 18 months in May. For his part, Stevenson was sentenced to one year probation, also in May.

Adam was initially charged in the incident and arrested at the George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston in May. Since then he has been held in a high security prison.

The conspiracy count that Mr. Adam pled guilty to carries a maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, or twice the gain or loss from the offense.

Sentencing is scheduled to take place on October 27, 2015.",3

I find it hard to believe that every single bond in the fund's portfolio defaulted at the same time.

TLT, comprised of treasuries which never default, did the same thing on Dec 29, 2008 and other dates as well. How is this possible?

My only guess is that the fund manager is intercepting the dividend/interest to reinvest into the fund when prices are low. Is this what is going on? Is this optimal behavior? What if I *want* that dividend payment from my bond? Am I better off buying individual bonds myself and avoiding bond funds?

In contrast equity funds have never withheld a dividend. This almost has me conclude, counterintuitively, that equities are safer than bonds. What's going on here?",10

15-07-15,3ddz2g,"Dear /r/investing, your destroying the markets.","Dear /r/ investing,

You're destroying the markets. 

We're in the 7th year of this bull market now and you are all still chugging away with your vanguard kool-aid, waiting to retire at 60 so you can yell at the kids running across your lawn. You're lazy, picking out passive investment funds solely for their low fees. You set aside a set % of your salary every month, sending it away to wall street where it can be pumped and dumped by institutional firms that care more about collecting their performance bonus and AUM rather than your dreams for a bigger house.

I know your happy with 4% a year, it adds up over time. Maybe in 20 years you can go on vacation for once on a yacht. You'll snap photos of some bullshit tourist vacation spot and pat yourself on the back for being disciplined all of these hard years. 

I bet you have heard startups are the big thing nowadays, but you probably don't know that small business creation is down. In fact, the number of small business in the USA has been declining for some time now. You may have had a friend or two who tried and failed, maybe they even asked you for funding? But who can take the risk on a company failing? That could set you back a few years of saving for your retirement/new house/other bullshit. Its better if the celebs on Shark Tank decide who get funding, what companies live and what companies die. They already have a few million in the bank, so what's loaning 10-25k here and there?

Instead, you read websites where they show that even if you started investing at the top every market for the past 30 years, you would still have a decent amount of money. Its probably better you take the safe route. Average returns for an average investment. 

The market will always go up in your mind. Even when its crashing, you're just telling yourself that its going to back up in a few years. Its just better to keep on buying and let the politics sort themselves out.

Life was tough a few years ago, the markets crashed, prices became affordable for once and volatility returned to normal levels, but when you have all of your eggs in 1 basket (or maybe 3 if you diversify between funds) you can't take that much of a hit on your portfolio. In fact, you probably applauded when the started QE. Don't worry they said! You've got the Fed on your side!  Yellen is there to make sure the price of your asset values never drop. God forbid we return to a normal volatility market and people actually have to perform rational fundamental analysis on stocks. So you keep putting in the hours and saving a few bucks every month and like a treadmill, the S&amp;P 500 has climbed ever higher, filled by your assets into outer space. 

Volatility? Whats that? BTFD! Greece? BTFD! China Tumbling? BTFD!

But what else can you do /r/investing? Saving money in a bank is about the worst idea in the world at the moment and you're desperate for those juicy gainz. Vanguards fees are low though, so just diversify through them. They know better.

Keep on praying to Yellen and the ZIRP gods, she'll keep your asset prices high. I'll stick to Zeus, pray for increased volatility and YOLO NBG. Hopefully he'll be pleased with my sacrificial lamb and chuck a few lightning bolts of disorder down from the skies.

15-07-15,3ddzeo,Can someone explain what just happened to Lucas Energy Inc. (LEI)?,"I was looking into LEI last night and submitted a market buy order for a small # of shares when it was at $0.11. I wake up this morning and it OPENED at $2.50 but looking at news for the company, their quarterly report (released two days ago - shouldn't that have changed the price, if it was going to at all, yesterday?) showed more losses and just hints of potential future mergers/control of hopefully good fields to invest in.

What caused the open price to surge so much? Did everyone else expect it to break out too which caused the price to skyrocket? Did this have some thing to do with the low trading volume and an unwise trader buying @ whatever opening cost?

I'm not sure if I should feel shafted for not getting those 2272% gains or if there's something here I'm just not understanding.

15-07-15,3ddzrc,34 Charged in Penny Stock Manipulation Scheme,"www.StockPromoters.com 

Yesterday, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged 15 individuals and 19 entities for their roles in alleged schemes to manipulate the trading of micro-cap stocks. The 34 defendants include six firms alleged to have acted as unregistered broker-dealers catering to customers who sought to conceal their stock ownership and manipulate the market for micro-cap securities. 

Owners and employees at the six firms, several customers, stock promoters and two micro-cap issuers – Warrior Girl Corp. and Nature’s Peak, (formerly Everock, Inc.) are among the defendants in the case filed in federal district court in Manhattan. The SEC charged the defendants with fraud, manipulative trading, touting, and with registration violations. Nine of the defendants were named in a criminal indictment charging them based on their roles in the alleged stock manipulation scheme.

The SEC complaint alleges that Costa Rica-based Moneyline Brokers and its founder Harold Bailey “B.J.” Gallison II unlawfully operated as a broker-dealer for U.S.-based customers who engaged in “pump-and-dump” schemes to artificially inflate a stock’s price and then sell their own shares. According to the complaint, Moneyline and certain of its employees routinely accepted transfers of micro-cap stocks from the U.S. customers and had stock certificates reissued in Moneyline’s name to conceal the true owners of the shares.

Carl H. Kruse Sr. and Carl H. Kruse Jr., both of Miami, allegedly conspired with Moneyline and others to manipulate trading in Warrior Girl, a former shell company that the Kruses controlled. Warrior Girl’s purported business changed from hydroelectric power (in 2008) to extracting oil from tar sands (in 2009) to online education (in 2010), and the Kruses allegedly engaged in multiple manipulations to profit from promotions to inflate the stock’s price. As a result of the various campaigns the Kruses are alleged to have obtained illegal profits estimated to total $2.3 million.

Another alleged scheme involved trading in Everock, Inc., a Canada-based mining company that relocated to Nevada and sold sandwich spreads after reorganizing itself with Nature’s Peak in 2008. A concerted campaign promoting the mining-turned condiment company allegedly included videos and Facebook postings and produced more than $2.5 million in profits for defendants Charles S. Moeller, of Sea Cliff, N.Y., Mark S. Dresner, of Dix Hills, N.Y. and Frank J. Zangara, of Locust Valley, N.Y.

In addition to Moneyline, the complaint alleges that two Costa Rica-based firms, Sandias Azucaradas CR, S.A. and Vanilla Sky, S.A., and three Nevada-based firms, Bastille Advisors, Inc., Club Consultants, Inc., and Jurojin, Inc., operated as unregistered broker-dealers. Employees of the firms who were charged are: Roger G. Coleman Sr., of Las Vegas, Ann M. Hiskey, of Costa Rica, Robin M. Rushing and David K. Rushing, both of Spokane, Wash., and Michael J. Randles, of Costa Rica. 

Promoters who were charged include: Dresner, Antonio J. Katz, of Red Bank, N.J., Moeller, Richard S. Roon, of Rumson, N.J., AKAT Global LLC, Digital Edge Marketing LLC, Oceanic Consulting LLC, and Spectrum Research Group Inc.

The other defendants charged are: Allan M. Migdall, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Robert S. Oppenheimer, of Belvedere Tiburon, Calif., Core Business One, Inc., Bermuda-based Fry Canyon Corp., L.F. Technology Group LLC, Starburst Innovations LLC, and Tachion Projects, Inc., along with B.H.I. Group, Inc. and U D F Consulting Inc., both of New York.

The SEC is seeking return of allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest from all defendants. It also is seeking civil monetary penalties from nearly all the defendants and seeks to bar nearly all of them from the penny stock business and bar some of them from serving as public company officers or directors.",6

15-07-15,3de8lf,Intellect Neurosciences: Are Paid Promotions Working? Discussion.,"www.StockPromoters.com 

Intellect Neurosciences, Inc. (PINK: ILNS) is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of disease-modifying therapeutic agents for the treatment and prevention of neurodegenerative conditions, especially proteinopathies, which include Alzheimer’s (AD), Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease, Frontotemporal Dementia and Age Related Macular degeneration.

This thinly traded micro-cap is currently the object of a paid pump campaign that started yesterday. The company has enlisted the services of promoters HSB Team, Value Penny Stocks, Small Cap Leader, HiddenGemStocks.com, and AllStarStockPicks help draw the attention of perspective investors.

Unfortunately, shares fell flat in yesterday’s trading after an impressive volume of over 670 thousand traded hands after the paid emails hit the Internet. Average volume is 48,350. The early morning price action reversed direction and by the bell ILNS ended up 17 percent in the red. It appears that the pumps didn’t quite work, at least in yesterday’s action.

Today doesn’t look any better. After closing at $0.21 yesterday, ILNS opened with a brief spike at $0.24 but has since lost 2.17 percent in this morning’s trading and is going for around $0.22 cents. The hoped for run just doesn’t seem to be happening as the company struggles to gain momentum.

Intellect’s latest financial report indicates that the company is not generating revenue through the sale of its products, but it is making a bit of cash by developing and licensing its patent portfolio. Annual losses for fiscal 2014 and 2013 were respectively $15 million and $9 million.
The company’s latest quarterly financial report end March 2015 shows:
$309 thousand in cash
$311 thousand in total assets
$31 million in current liabilities
$1.2 million in quarterly revenues
$4.9 million in quarterly net loss
The beta of the stock is recorded at -2.14 and the EPS of the stock remains -5.49. The shares outstanding of the stock are 3.37 million. Market cap sits at $784,469.

Don’t count Intellect out just yet. The promotions may yet help this micro-cap biopharmaceutical firm. Watch the stock closely and due a bit of research before investing. It may well be worth your pennies. On the other hand, as with any thinly traded micro-cap, volatility will always be an issue.

I just skimmed the post where a guy paid $330 for a trade he brought to his FA and figured people should probably know that an option like this exists. 

This is /r/investing not /r/stockmarket, so I know there are ~~probably~~ definitely differing opinions on whether or not it's actually beneficial for most of us to have an app on our phone where we can fire off trades for $0... I know I've already probably made a few more trades I would have otherwise, but it's good to know an option like this is out there if you are going to dabble. And for those who have more limited funds, where an $8-10 fee might constitute a non trivial amount of your investment, this is a really great thing.

The company is Robinhood. Here is some quick info:

&gt; For those wondering, Robinhood is registered with the SEC and is a member of FINRA and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC).)

Their most recent filing was ""We can't file because 3rd parties haven't provided information yet"".  The billion dollar contract announced is ""multi-year"" so it could be 500m for 2 years for 50m for 20.   The contract is in africa so its probably as stable as the congo's government.   Even if its all legit, delivery and construction doesn't even begin until q3 of next year and what are they going to live on until that revenue stream kicks up?

.

On the bright side, this is a .088 stock that has a potential multi-million dollar revenue stream which means it could indeed be a big stock eventually.

I got out at .088 yesterday with a good profit thanks to WSB, but I can't decide to YOLO here or on the next big thing because this has the potential to tie up a bit of the YOLO fund for YEARS.

Boy was I wrong. Scottrade screwed up when the wire was supposed to be sent (they promised early morning close to the market open) and actually sent it around 1PM EST. Waited all afternoon and night for wire to post. Never posted and was rejected for suspicious reasons. Tried to have it wired again Thursday and they told me wire cut off was at 1PM so I could not trade GOOG and jump in on that huge gain after hours.   Anybody here else have this experience with Scottrade when switching to another BETTER broker? I sincerely believe they stalled purposely because they knew earnings was coming and they expected me to keep my money with Scottrade and trade with them through earnings. If they intentionally pulled these shenanigans I think I may have a legitimate lawsuit and at the very least a valid  complaint to the SEC or FINRA. I googled consumer reviews of SCottrade and I see numerous complaints regarding people having issues wiring their money out of Scottrade into another brokerage. IMO this is criminal behavior and the SEC should come down hard on Scottrade. They are absolute scum. ,0

15-07-17,3dlixk,"Microsoft's next Quarterly Earnings","Thoughts on MSFT's earnings performance?

Many other tech companies are doing well including Intel and Google. Unlike last quarter, companies are doing well in both revenue and EPS.

The negative seems to be the big lay offs and 7 billion write-down from the failed Nokia business. Do the lay-offs signal bad things behind the scenes?

The writedown has happened before where MSFT wrote down 6 billion from aQuantive. This resulted in a negative EPS for the quarter but the stock didn't move much.

Today, the writedown has already been revealed so investors already know about it. They can use non-GAAP accounting to work around it and show that w/o the writedown, their core biz is still doing well.

I'm guessing forward guidance may be optimistic with the release of Windows 10 and their enterprise and cloud software businesses. So in my opinion it will be decent guidance vs layoffs + writedown.

I'd consider myself educated but I don't know about investing, stocks, or anything of the nature in the slightest. I've been working in the ED for 7 years now but have only just opened a retirement account. I'm currently placing 6% into the account as that yields the highest match (2.5%) from my employer. 

I'm not sure if it'd be beneficial but I'll give you some simplified facts about myself in hopes that it will provide more individualized feedback. I have an AA in business, a BAS in healthcare management, and will have my ASN-RN degree this year. Next year I plan to go to grad-school for the RN-MSN bridge program; this only takes one year. By the time I graduate with my MSN, I will have some experience as an RN and will be moving away from my current location. Right now Austin is in the lead, but Oregon and California are runner-ups. Currently, my job that requires no education pays around $27,000. Again, though, I just set up retirement last month. I wish I'd have started sooner but that's neither here nor there. As a new RN in this area, I will be making roughly $23 an hour starting out.

Taking anything that's relevant into account, what's the best way for me to invest my money in this pay grade? It's by no means a lot, but I know it's enough to invest and live on. Currently, my liabilities equate to about $1100 a month and I do not anticipate that changing until I move. It should be known that I'm not a huge fan of risk and that I prefer stability.

Yesterday, The Securities and Exchange Commission filed charges against a San Diego man for stealing money from clients for personal use and conducting a Ponzi scheme to pay customers making redemption requests.

In a complaint filed in federal court in San Diego, the SEC alleges that Paul Lee Moore and Coast Capital Management, his purported investment advisory firm, raised $2.6 million from clients. Instead of investing their money as promised, Moore allegedly siphoned nearly $2 million of client funds to pay travel expenses, buy retail goods, and fund his use of pornographic websites. 

The complaint alleges that Moore used the remaining $625,000 in client funds to repay earlier clients with money from new clients in classic Ponzi scheme fashion. Moore allegedly sent fake account statements to clients showing securities that he never purchased and attracted new clients when existing customers showed the statements to family, friends, and business associates. 

Moore also is alleged to have lied to clients about his education, past employment experience, and the amount assets managed by Coast Capital.

Coast Capital, which was not registered as an investment adviser with the SEC or any state regulator, is no longer in business.

“As alleged in our complaint, Moore betrayed his clients, brazenly stole nearly $2 million for his own activities and conducted a Ponzi scheme with the remaining funds,” said Michele W. Layne, Director of the SEC’s Los Angeles Regional Office.

The SEC’s complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, charges Moore with violating federal antifraud laws and related SEC rules. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, return of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a penalty.

In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of California announced criminal charges against Moore.",3

15-07-16,3dhcr6,Why allocate asset classes to market proportions when equal portions have better ROI?,"I continue to see people here say to proportion your asset classes in an investment to meet the market, and then ""tilt"" it to small caps if you want. I hear this is called Core-Satellite, having a large index like Vanguard Total Stock Market (VTI) surrounded by secondary weights like REITs and small caps.

But this does not embrace diversification as well as *equally* diversifying in a number of uncorrelated asset classes and subclasses.

See this: [http://imgur.com/6Vs62sy](http://imgur.com/6Vs62sy)

Source: [www.portfoliovisualizer.com](http://www.portfoliovisualizer.com)

Portfolio 1 is market proportioned during the ""lost decade"" of 2000-2009. Market proportioned means it is 70% large cap, 20% mid cap, and 10% small cap (rebalanced annually). Portfolio 2 is simply making an investment 34% large, 33% mid, 33% small cap (rebalanced annually).

Portfolio 1 has a return of 1.02% per year and a standard deviation of 21.62%, with earnings of $11,063. Portfolio 2 earns **$2,600 more**, with a return of 3.26% and a comparable standard deviation of 22.62%.

Things get really good if we *equally* divide an investment between 7 subclasses: 

* 15% US large cap
* 14% US mid cap
* 14% US small cap
* 14% REITS
* 15% international developed
* 14% international small cap
* 14% emerging markets

See this: [http://imgur.com/xjEcR9T](http://imgur.com/xjEcR9T)

The 10 year earning is now $18,413, with a return of 6.29%. The standard deviation only slightly increases to 25.9%. This is $7,000 more than a market proportioned investment, and suddenly the ""lost decade"" doesn't seem so lost.

But many of you would rightly include international stocks in your portfolio. A common portfolio I see in the /r/investing/ reddit is something like:

* 50% US stock market (VTI)
* 25% international stocks
* 10% US small cap
* 10% international small cap
* 5% REITs

After all, this is a ""market proportion"" of the global equities market. So let's backtest my 14% equally weighted portfolio again this ""market proportioned"" portfolio **since 1972** using an initial investment of $10,000.

Results here: [http://imgur.com/mXXuTUG](http://imgur.com/mXXuTUG)

At the end of 42 years, my equally weighted 14% allocation has earned $1.8M, **$800,000 more** than the typical allocation I see on this reddit, and with less than a 1% increase in standard deviation (volatility).

So can somebody please explain why people try to mirror the market proportions when creating a diversified portfolio of equities?",5

15-07-17,3dmtme,Attorney Slapped with Insider Trading Allegation,"www.StockPromoters.com

Yesterday, federal authorities charged a Pennsylvania-based attorney with insider trading in the stock of Harleysville Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: HGIC) in advance of the 2011 announcement of a $760 million merger of Harleysville and Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company.

According to the SEC, Herbert K. Sudfeld illegally traded on the news that sent Harleysville’s stock price up 87 percent when the merger of the two insurance companies was announced in September 2011. At the time, Sudfeld was a real estate partner at a law firm that advised Harleysville on the merger. Sudfeld was not involved in the merger and learned that the announcement of it was imminent from a conversation between an attorney working on the transaction and their shared legal assistant.

Sudfeld allegedly stole the inside information and purchased Harleysville stock in his and his wife’s accounts. Once the merger was announced, Sudfeld sold all the shares he had purchased, realizing approximately $79,000 of illegal profits.

""We're charging Mr. Sudfeld with securities fraud as well as lying to the FBI,"" said assistant U.S. attorney Denise Wolf, the prosecutor handling the case. ""These are serious charges and we're waiting for the trial process to take place.""

""With respect to these material matters, defendant Herbert Sudfeld stated that he was not aware of the Harleysville stock transactions until several days to a week afterwards,"" the indictment said. ""These statements were false, as defendant Herbert Sudfeld then knew.""

The SEC’s complaint filed in federal court in Philadelphia names Sudfeld’s wife, Mary Jo Sudfeld, as a relief defendant for the purpose of recovering insider trading profits in her brokerage account through trades conducted by Sudfeld. The complaint charges Sudfeld with violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and an SEC antifraud rule.
 
The SEC seeks a permanent injunction and financial penalties against Sudfeld and return of allegedly ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest from Sudfeld and Mary Jo Sudfeld.

In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania announced criminal charges against Sudfeld.",1

15-07-17,3dmyu1,China Trade IDEA - would love to discuss and/or answer any questions,"I'm new to posting on reddit so I thought I would share a trade idea as an early thx for joining the thread. There's a lot of discussion on China and taking advantage of the volatility. Here's a way to capitalize on the volatility while still being able to (somewhat) control your risk. Here goes- Closed End Funds trade at a discount or premium to their Net Asset Value (NAV). They do this because CEF's r dominated by retail players; because of supply and demand they drift away from the value of there underlying basket. For more info on closed end plz read at cefa.com, they do a great job explaining... CAF is a closed end fund that holds a basket of Chinese stocks. CAF also historically trades about 5% under its NAV, which is common for CEF, some trade at a premium and others at a big discount but the overall avg of the space is -7 ish. CAF closed last night at -28 discount! So it's trading 28% less than its holdings. The arb is to buy the CEF and sell the basket, but there all Chinese companies so how can we sell the basket??? I ran a correlation analysis (and added other inputs) to value the results of my analysis. I came out with 2 stocks that are a good hedge for CAF -- look at ASHR and XPP, these have a 77% and 71% correlation to CAF's NAV (not just CAF). These stocks r slippery little guys but there's plenty of volume to get orders done, and they trade on US exchanges. So there u have it new message board friends: Buy CAF v. Short ASHR, XPP Be careful - i should add (as CFA 2 candidate) this is not a trade suggestion, everyone has there own financial situation -- just wanted to point out where I see value. And tell u about one of my positions :)

15-07-16,3dkbm6,Get your tickets now to the $MNGA space yacht ferrari rocket ship to the moon.,"A set up for GAINSSSSSSSSSSS.

Potential near term catalysts:

1. Hog farm waste testing that started a little under a year ago: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/magnegas-signs-agreement-with-major-hog-farm-for-demo-and-sale-of-sterilization-system-273939041.html

2. Co-combustion EPA testing results: http://www.environmentalleader.com/2014/01/27/magnegas-forms-subsidiary-to-market-coal-co-combustion/ 

3. Now this potential sale in Haiti that looks very promising: http://www.wset.com/story/29562060/major-government-contractor-and-minister-of-energy-in-haiti-considering-magnegas-fuel-and-equipment-import

4. A few huge previously unnamed companies to be released along with details—possibly contracts. See recent PRs.

Earnings might even pump this one up, expected around mid-August. New customers this quarter: Union Pacific, NYFD, US Navy, LB Construction, AB&amp;I Foundry/McWane, and Duke Energy.

If you're interested in what the fuck they are doing and the long term strategy of the company, listen to this interview with the CEO from May: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH8BGL15ypg

**RISKS:**

If none of the above catalysts come before earnings and earnings are bad, she could drop. There are a few reasons earnings could be bad even though there are many new customers. First of all, the customers need to use up the acetylene they already have before they make big purchases from MagneGas. Secondly, production abilities of MagneGas are currently unknown after the recent accident. However, keep in mind that MagneGas also owns ESSI and they can supply acetylene to their customers in the mean time, making it easier for them to switch their business over.

Biggest downside here is that they aren't making any money and need to do another offering, but that wouldn't happen until Q4 anyway. With the above catalysts in mind that gives us plenty of time for a YOLO.

Hands down though this is the most interesting company I've ever been following, whether it takes me to the moon or my mother's basement.

**Below is where you motherfuckers tell me I'm a fucking idiot, link to their bad financials, talk about the insider sales from the 90 year old grandmother who's retired, etc.**

15-07-16,3dkcos,$CBI clear skies next week -- DD,"Full disclosure, I got into this stock at a $51.15 basis and am holding it long.

TL:DR; CBI's low points are behind it, Friday and Monday are excellent buy ins (this is not a YOLO, but I expect a solid 10% gain over the next few weeks).

$CBI is a [severely undervalued stock](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3151926-is-chicago-bridge-and-iron-still-undervalued).   It's held by Buffets and Einhorn. Einhorn's fund increased its steak in Q2.   A quick glance at the key statistics should show you how undervalued this stock is.

Negatives: The stock was sunk to the $45 range (recovering to $48.90 today) because it's an european company in the euro zone so it got hit by the greek crisis hard, despite its diversification it's heavily tied to oil although the Iran deal should open up new construction opportunities (a factor in its recovery).     Because of the dip and the charts and [HUGE number of options at 45 and 47](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/cbi/option-chain) with July 17 expirations it was [subject to a short attack](http://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_39437742.png?1436456234) ( also there were regular dips between 10-11est because of a fund possibly divesting).  It's probable the bulk of those puts were added as a hedge [by the new fund investment in q2](http://www.stockpickr.com/pro/portfolio/greenlight-capital-david-einhorn/), and interestingly there are new august puts for the same level which might mean that the fund will continue to increase its stake in q3.

There is a [lingering question](http://seekingalpha.com/article/2272133-chicago-bridge-and-iron-acquisition-accounting-shenanigans-dramatically-inflate-profitability-prescience-point-initiates-at-strong-sell) over nuclear cost overruns and their shaw acquisition, but the feeling is that this will not impact CBI to any great degree and the costs will be [bourn by Westinghouse](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/09/us-toshiba-accounting-divestiture-idUSKCN0PI2UA20150709).  At the very least the July 23rd conference call should provide a little more guidance in this area.

Positives: The quarterly meeting is scheduled for the 23rd.  They've announced ~400m in NEW contracts ([Texas](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/cb-announces-plant-services-contract-120000529.html), [Egypt](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/cb-announces-technology-award-egypt-120000127.html), [Peru](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/cb-announces-maintenance-award-peru-120000691.html), [Canada](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/cb-announces-maintenance-construction-award-120000397.html)and [Omaha](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/cb-announces-plant-services-contract-120000529.html)) in the last two weeks (lost in the greek crisis).   They announced they've secured an [800m line of credit](http://biz.yahoo.com/e/150714/cbi8-k.html) and reading the agreement there's a clause that allows a portion of it to be used for stock support (presumably to ward off short attacks).   Since that announcement the selloffs seem to be countered by similar buy ins.  CBI also had an existing buyback policy for 10% of their stock over the next 2 years.

Thanks to the improving greece and euro situation and oil and possible new investments either by CBI or others the stock has rebounded nicely to $49.00 but for the next few weeks there are few puts and calls and there only seems to be positive news going into the July 23rd conference call so there is every possibility for this stock to return to the 55 trading range it played in, in June.  And most analysts expect this to be a $60.00 stock, and if you look at the financials of their competitors they're being conservative.

A [recent article](http://www.themarketsdaily.com/analyst-actions/chicago-bridge-iron-company-n-v-is-expected-to-report-1-44-for-q1/37402/) pegged CBI's estimated earnings at .07 higher than current estimates at $1.44 vs q1 earnings at $1.21 per share.

TL:DR; CBI's low points are behind it, Friday and Monday are excellent buy ins (this is not a YOLO, but I expect a solid 10% gain over the next month or two).",3
15-07-16,3dkczo,"How Much Money Can I Make As a Day Trader? – Here we’ll look at income potential for stock, forex and futures day traders"," this is what traders and potential traders want to know–“How much money can I make as a day trader?” Obviously there is a massive range of income potential when it comes to day traders. It is quite possible that some will still need to work another job, but manage to a pull a little money of the market each month through day trading. There are those who can live comfortably on what they make day trading, and there is the small percentage that make a lot.

How much money you make as a day trader will be largely determined by:

—Which market you trade. Each market has different advantages. Stocks are generally the most capital intensive asset class, so if you trade another asset class such as futures or forex you can generally start trading with less capital.

—How much money you start with. If you start trading with $2000 your income potential is far less than someone who starts with $20,000.

—How much time you put in to your trading education. To get to the level of trading discussed in the scenarios below–where you have a solid trading plan and are able to implement it–it will likely take a year or more if you dedicate yourself to it full-time. If can only apply yourself to trading part time, it may take several years to get to this level (examples below).

Your income potential will also be determined by your personality–are you disciplined, patience, etc–and the strategies you use. Although, these issues will not be our focus here. If you want trading strategies, trading tutorials or articles on trading psychology you can visit the Trading Tutorials page, or check out my Forex Strategies Guide.

Income potential is also based on volatility in the market. The following scenarios assume a certain number of trades each day, with a certain risk and profit potential. In very slow market conditions it may not be possible to find many valid trades (as described below), but when the market is moving aggressively you have more opportunities.

Now, let’s go through a few scenarios to answer the question, “How much money can I make as a day trader?

For all the scenarios I will assume that you never risk more than 1% of your account on a single trade. Risk is the potential loss on a trade, defined as the difference between the entry price and stop price, multiplied by how many units of the asset you are holding.

There is no reason to risk more than 1% of your account. As I will show, even with keeping risk  very low, you can earn an income from day trading. The new strategy of an old trader is out 16/7/2015. Read the review

15-07-18,3dos3p,Buying an investment property and renting your own residence,"When you buy your first property, generally, you buy your primary residence. This means that you can afford to buy a place where you work, which is often hard to do if you live in a high cost of living area and are at the very start of your career, and also that you should be pretty sure that you will spend the next few years in said place, because if real estate prices go down, or simply if you move just a year after you buy, between the closing costs, realtor fees and the cost of moving in, you may lose money.

Another idea would be instead to buy a rental, so you can get the benefits of getting on the property ladder while at the same time keep the flexibility of renting a property fit for your needs.

Why would you opt for a rental?
Well as I said above, the first thing that comes to mind is that your local property market may not be ideal for home ownership if priced are on the rise. The rent vs buy calculations may not lean towards buying in overpriced housing bubbles. But you live there, so you still need a place to stay. What better way to have someone pay your rent while you build up equity on the property they live in?

You may not make enough to buy a place in New York, but already have savings that would represent a hefty deposit in Kansas City. And the rent would bring a better return on your deposit than the 0.1% your cash is bringing right now.

If you are living with a significant other, and not ready to put both names on the deed, it allows you to keep your place together while you start investing on your own.

And if you are just starting your career, you should not get tied to a property when your next job could be 3,000 miles away.

By buying a rental, you could move pretty much anywhere without worrying about having to sell your home before doing so. That is what I did with my UK property. I lived there for less than a year (with roommates) before putting the whole place up for rent and moving to Morocco. Now, I am still a continent away, and on top of that have put six time zones between my property and myself. And you know what? It works out just fine.

My tenants each rent a bedroom on separate contracts, and when one is about to vacate, they interview potential tenants to find the new roommate. I take care of bills and include them in their rent so they don’t have to fight about splitting them equally. The only little bumps on the way are generally about cleaning habits of some of them, so I am thinking about raising the rents and including a weekly cleaner. Other than this, if the washing machine or the heater breaks, I just send a handyman and wire them the money.

So I wouldn’t be worried about having a property two hours drive away, if one ocean away is doable.

What I thought before I left was that the rent I would get from the bedroom I used to occupy, around $1,000, would basically cover my rental needs anywhere in the world. Yes, $1,000 is pretty expensive for a room, but that is under market price when said room is in an affluent suburb of London. I have only had one week vacancy in one of the rooms over the past 5 years.

In Guatemala, $1,000 happens to cover my entire living expenses and the salaries of two staff, because I paid cash for my house, but it would more than cover my rent of a three bed luxury condo in a great neighborhood of Guatemala City. Even in Europe, aside from London, Paris and a few overpriced capitals, I could get a comfy two bedroom and live on my own. And if I felt like going back to Paris for a while, $1,000 would still get me an independent, albeit smaller unit.

I really like that the money from rent can be allocated to my living expenses, just like the time my motorcycle insurance company paid for some advertising on my blogs, enough to cover two years of bike insurance. You get the idea, getting a fixed source of income gives you the freedom of using that same income to cover the same category of expense for your flexible life.

 

Where should you buy a property?
If you have a nomadic lifestyle like I do, the world is pretty much your oyster. And if your career could take you anywhere in the country, buying next to where you live now may not be buying where your next job will be, so once again, you could look at your whole state, or your whole country. Some ideas include

- A college town. Students rarely buy a place during their college years, and you have a constant influx of potential new tenants. I am in a college town and my prices deter the freshmen so usually I get the PhD students or the recent graduates working their first job. They are serious, and often have mum and dad behind, which is extra consolation.

- Your hometown. While you may not live there at the beginning of your career, you may aspire to come back once you settle down and start a family. Plus your parents could keep an eye on the property, send their trusted handyman to do maintenance or chase payments face to face for you. You don’t want to be a burden but it gives you some peace of mind to know there is still a family member nearby if things go sour. You are also able to make an educated decision about each neighborhood without too much research, as you lived there for years.

- The highest yielding market. A quick online search will tell you which markets offer the highest rent in your region of choice.

- The best house you can afford on a high down payment. Things may not always go the way you planned and your property may sit empty for a while, and having low repayments will make life much easier. You could look for a place that is affordable right now, and put a 30-50% deposit on it, so the rent is only a fraction of the repayments. That will also allow you to live on the surplus should you lose your job, to pay off the rest of the mortgage early as well, or to set aside a good chunk of money for future renovations.

- A duplex. When you live a nomadic lifestyle, you often want a base to come home to. Buying a duplex or a triplex allows you to have renters pay most of the housing costs while you still keep a small unit as your own to store your stuff and re-energize when you are tired of traveling. Plus they serve as free house sitters!",1
15-07-18,3dos70,Boeing (BA) and Airbus (AIR) due to Iran Deal?,"Trade sanctions on Iran from 1995 will remain. The only exception to that first tier of sanctions in this new deal (if Iran passes preliminary examinations from the UN) is that Boeing and other commercial aircraft manufacturers will be able to sell to Iran with state department permission. This line was requested specifically by the Iranian delegation due to the hazardous and crippled state of the current Iranian commercial aircraft (they frequently fail mid air, several passenger planes have killed hundreds if not thousands of Iranians in the past decade). Iran air and other domestic Iranian airlines have claimed they are ready to purchase billions of dollars worth of planes in a very short amount of time. Do you guys think its worth jumping in now? Some have estimated over 20 billion dollars between Airbus and Boeing alone for Iran Air, basically all the planes they didn't have the luxury of buying since the 90's, in addition to endless amount of parts and maintenance they were also barred from. 

Thoughts?

Sure the price is volatile but the dividends are pretty steady. If one were to buy and hold forever (without selling, Buffet-style) and just live off the dividend payments, and keep a 1-5 year cash reserve to help smooth the low periods, what could go wrong?

The worst thing I can see happening is that the fund wouldn't appreciate much in value, so like a fixed annuity, the purchasing power of your dividends would depreciate over time.

Would junk bonds have any place in a retirement portfolio?",15

The only difference I personally see is that an article was written about the effect on UA, but not Nike. Now don't get me wrong, this will hurt foreign sales, and make UA less competitive with Adidas, but UA's sales are mostly in the US at this point. So these ""Headwinds"" UA is facing are laughable compared to Nike's. The only major risk I see is that UA is continuing to invest in digital goods, which will decrease cash flows, resulting in lower profits. ",4

15-07-18,3dpcn9,Applying structured settlements concept for divorce negotiations,"Whenever a divorce happens, all of sudden the financial condition of a spouse comes under the microscope and it has been observed that more often than not there is not a guarantee of a stable income and there have been instances where things went out of control to say the least. The source of income post a divorce is often seen to be inconsistent without having a good reliance of meeting the financial needs of the spouse. There had been numerous fake promises which were committed by the payee with no concrete actions whatsoever. However, this kind of situations could be easily avoided with the help of structured settlements. What that will do is it will not only guarantee the spouse with a consistent source of income in periodic intervals but also make sure that the spouse gets all the benefits which were being promised by the payee at the time of divorce.

Beneficial for both the parties

The best thing in applying structured settlements for divorce negotiation is the fact that it is beneficial for both the payee as well as the receiver. Some of the advantages have been listed below for your reference:

Benefits for receivers:  The biggest benefit for a receiver is the sense of security it brings in divorce negotiations. You can free yourselves from all kinds of worries because you will get all the things which you. The payments will be contractually guaranteed with no market risks tied to them. The mode of payment will be flexible and will be distributed in long intervals.

Benefits for payees:  After a divorce, the payees would not like to remain in touch with the receiver and they try every means to maintain distance because divorce is always a very nasty affair to deal with. Having structured settlements as a part of the divorce process, you can free yourselves from any kind of attachment from your ex-spouse. You can also save a lot of money if you resort to making this kind of a settlement in a structured manner.

The process

A structured settlement in divorce negotiations usually is a very simple process and there is no rocket science involved in it.  A settlement planner plays an extremely critical role in such settlements and the financial advisor gets in touch with him in order to have a seamless settlement. The planner discusses all the pros and cons which are associated with the process of divorce and what his/her needs for future are.  The spouse is also made aware about the consequences of taxes associated with such a settlement. The best aspect of having a settlement planner work on behalf of you is that there isn’t any additional cost involved in it and you can avail the services free of co

Once the process of paying in parts is over, the Payee decides whether or not the payment should be a periodic one or a lump sum one. The agreement which allows the payer spouse to make periodic payments is known as Marital Settlement Agreement.  An assignment company is selected and the payee transfers the lump sum amount with discounted rates. It is extremely important to reach out to an assignment company because this will eventually help you to save a lot of taxes in the long run.

Application of structured settlements in divorce negotiations

Now that you are through with the process your next step is to know exactly where structured settlements have the greatest of impacts in divorce negotiations. Following are some of them:

Martial assets can be evenly segregated: The advantage of such a settlement over divorce is that the financial assets between husband and wife get evenly distributed and there is no room for disputes afterwards. Both are clear about their assets and hence there is a lesser scope of a debate between the two parties.

Child share: The share of child has always been a very debatable affair in cases of divorce and it is only through structured settlement you can expect to have a comparatively smoother ride. This kind of settlement covers almost all attributes related to a child post divorce starting from tax benefits.

You are aware about your savings and earnings: This kind of settlement gives you ample opportunity to know about your savings as well as earnings out of a divorce and it is not at all complicated.

Conclusion

Therefore, as you can see , in today’s age where divorce rates are on the rise, structured settlements are a boon to those couples who are on the verge of separation and don’t know exactly how to streamline things. Following such a settlement scheme not only helps to have a smooth divorce process but also helps you to maintain a healthy relationship with your ex-spouse in future.",1

15-07-17,3dnt3o,Some questions regarding stock issuing,"Hi,

1. I read about the Facebook IPO a few years ago and something isn't quite clear for me. From wikipedia and other websites I find that underwriters settled at an initial price of $38 per share, valuing the company at $104 billion. However, Facebook itself only received 16 billion from this IPO. How did the company itself receive this 16 billion, and is it normal that it is such a small percentage of the estimated total value (104 billion)? In companies like Microsoft, Apple, do the CEOs have 50+% of shares, or simply the highest percentage, or does the company itself somehow 'own' shares of itself? And in the case of Facebook, some employees such as Mark Zuckenberg probably had shares when the company was not yet public. Are these shares converted to public shares when the company goes public (for example, the same relative amount, so 1 stock before it was public now equals 300,000 stocks for example)? How does it work?

2. Also, looking at the annual report of Google 2014, I find that the shares used in basic per share calculations increased from 672,587 in 2014 to 680,915 in 2015. Can a company easily, and often, issue new shares? Does this happen often?

3. I would also like to know why companies buy back their stock? Is it because basically dividend payments can be seen as a form of interest payments? But surely, the more shares are bought back, the higher the price of the remaining shares in the market because public investors know that a significant percentage of shares has added benefits (saying rights, etc)? Is it the company who buys back the stock, or is it a person like the CEO? Does it happen often that a company whose shares were scattered around the market, buys back enough to have 50.001+% of its own shares in possession eventually?

4. Lastly, I would like to know the value of preferred stocks. I am reading The Intelligent Investor to start with and preferred stocks are mentioned quite often. However, as they have no voting rights, shouldn't their value be significantly lower? They have higher rights for dividends, but is it also more dividend? Can most preferred stocks be converted, making them some kind of convertable loan?

Thank you for your time.",6

Obviously if you ask them basic stuff like if they are using level 2, they have no clue what that even is. (so they are pretty much randomly guessing on an entry, not educated).

I blocked out the usernames in this picture, it was one of the best examples I could find recently:

As a new wave of traders come into this subreddit, another wave fades off. This is because most people either: lose interest, lose money, or don't have time as they did before. It frequently happens in waves when extremely cheap pennystocks rise/fall without the need of serious analysis. Anyone could pick some random pump and keep buying into them. Eventually you will get a bad entry and lose 80%+ of what you had. I'd assume most people just buy in with no plan and hope for the best. This isn't even a strategy, it is just bad trading. This chaotic style is not only not sustainable, it creates a dangerous gambling mindset in most people. They think ""I was just up $100, as long as I hold it should be over $200 or even 300!"" My point is that no matter what anyone says about a ticker I will refute it if I disagree (which is good, what good trader is easily lured by some random internet pleb?). It is what everyone should do, be independent and not blindly follow crowds.",1
15-07-18,3dqqw6,Is there any easy way to track the number of shares outstanding over time with a particular stock?,"Newbie question here.

On Yahoo finance and Google finance, I can easily see what the share price has been over time by moving my cursor along the price curve.  But I am more interested in seeing how the market cap has changed over time, as well as how many shares are outstanding at different points so I can determine dilution rates.  Is there a way to easily track this like you can with the actual stock price?  ",17

15-07-17,3do6og,Calm Down,"What I have noticed
-

 In the past couple of days I have been in other ""trading"" subreddits and they all seem to be open to opinions. The people on those subreddits are very open minded and are not limiting themselves to one style of trading. For some reason this subreddit hasn't been open to opinions. Any post that's an opinion gets downvoted into oblivion and never gets a solid chance. The only posts on the top of the front page are posts like ""What do you guys think of X stock"". 

In other subreddits they are not downvoting posts just because they dislike the person or because they disagree. They only downvote when a post is ""spam"". 

So my point is, I think it would make this subreddit a lot better if people weren't so quick to downvote posts. If someone gives you advice (Even if it is bad advice), just be happy you are getting advice. Because when you think about it, 99%+ of traders DO NOT get advice from anyone.

To quote enzomatic75:

* **So I keep my status low key and try to contribute to this sub but I find that it's a huge karma suck because this sub is quite literally a circle jerk of hacks that have little idea of what they are talking about. I have posted great tips that have been generous to me, downvoted in to invisibility. I have given great advice to idiots wondering which marijuana PINK sheet to invest in and given them sound advice, like NO!**

(keep in mind he posted this A YEAR AGO and the same thing is still happening)

-

This subreddit needs to be more open, posts about what people are actually trading vs what stock picks they want. Plus, the highest quality posts are the ones that are the most downvoted. Why? Because they say something truthful and try to help the OP in the long run. I know you might be saying ""well thats just how traders are""; not true. This is the only subreddit that I have encountered that does this. 


-

Examples: https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/3dn2d9/just_bought_in_to_onvo_at_38/ct71off?context=3

Here I state my opinion saying ""I don't see the reasoning for buying into it at the moment."" And I am immediately said to be a ""basher"" who only looks to criticize every ticker possible. What I said wasn't even bad either, it was probably the nicest way I could put it. You ask for an opinion so I will give it.

Want to know why I disagree so frequently? Because the majority of the time they are wrong to begin with. Too many people on here suffer from the dunning kruger effect and that's a fact.

First off, I am aware why I have been getting a lot of hate lately. Sure I enjoy talking about stocks and fooling around when I do. Some times I am just quickly writing a post and fooling around at what I am saying. I have become accustomed to blocking out negativity and refocusing my energy on those deserving of it. And more importantly, the people who bring me happiness. With that said, I apologize for subjecting my fans and followers to the nonsense and childish behavior of some people close to me. At this level, I understand the acts I keep is often a reflection of me and I take responsibility to make sure those type of antics are not tolerated. Throwing stones is a sign of weakness, I choose to be strong. To the people that support me, your loyalty and support has given me the best 6 months I could ask for on reddit.

No matter what I posted he would just insult me and attack me, even if I wasn't even posting on anything related to stocks.

15-07-17,3do89a,The holy grail of trading: the key to success,"It's not gurus, it's not technical analysis, and its not fundamental analysis. It's Risk Management and managing expectations versus reality. The bottom line, if you want to be successful, then you have to manage your risk. It took me 7 years to learn this.

Let me explain: 

As retail traders, we are on the butt end of the news and information about a company. Ahead of us, you have employees, preferred share holders, friends of employees, friends of execs and etc. So, really, we are just fighting for scraps at the end of the day and taking each other's money.

You might think you know it all, and boast about how you've made money for the last 5 years...and how you have 5 years experience trading. Well, hate to break it to you, but we've been in a bull market...9/10 stocks on the SP 500 probably made money in that time frame. So you had a 10% chance of failure. But, keep up the good work and that great attitude of yours! 

The market is, bottom line, unpredictable. A stock will do whatever it pleases, regardless of technical analysis or fundamental analysis.  So let's stop giving ourselves credit for predicting what a stock will do. There are too many traders patting themselves on the back for good trades and blaming oblivious or uncontrollable factors for their failed trades. You know the saying ""Hind sight is 20/20"". Everyone  ""knows"" the answer to a problem after looking at the answer, but when you're looking at the problem,first hand, the answer is a little bit foggy. The reality is with failed trades is, regardless of what you think you knew or was blind and didn't see, is that there was a chance that it would still fail. No matter what action you took. That's the reality. You can't predict it. 

For example, let's talk about blackberry. You'll hear everyone from your friend to the pope, telling you blackberry was doomed in 2007. They'll tell you, it wasn't innovative, it had growing competition, etc etc etc and that's why it ultimately failed. Well, if it were that obvious, a lot of people should've gotten rich off that major collapse. The thing is, it isn't obvious and you'd never be able to predict that it would tank this bad. They could've had some new secret tech to be released that you've never heard about. They could've signed some deals with other large corporations. Anything could have happened for it to rebound or rise even higher. So, it wasn't predictable.

Now, this is very similar to Apple. If apple goes up, you'll hear people spout the same thing. Innovative, good sales, competition who cares etc etc etc. The thing is, apple isn't really innovating on its smart phone...it's more or less been the same for the last 8 years...the innovation is very minor. You'll hear people argue otherwise, but at the core, it isn't very innovative for its mobile sector. Apple also has growing competition...just look at the growing number of handsets...and If apple were to tank, you'd hear people saying it wasn't innovative and that they knew it was going to tank. Well, if that were the case, you'd have a lot of smart people shorting it and buying puts against it right now. 

So the only way to guarantee success is to properly manage your risk and establish solid positions with a good cost average. 
What I mean by this is, never have all your money in the market at once. IF you are going to have all your money in one stock, make sure you have a solid exit plan that you will follow to the T. This means, if you say you're going to sell at a $100 loss. you better sell. 

The other thing you can do to manage your risk is manage your position size. This means, plan for the worst case scenario i.e a 50% drop and adjust your position size accordingly and only play with money you are expecting to lose. 

For example,  lets say that TD is trading at $50 right now and you wanted a long position. You can either risk a defined portion of your account that you're willing to lose i.e 2% and then hold until it either goes up or goes to zero or until you lose half. 

You can also scale into the position with X amount of dollars. This means, have an idea of what the lowest price TD can go for and all the expected rebound prices in between; you can use these points as entry points. For example, if there are 10 expected rebound points (support levels), then you'd have an equal amount to spend at each level, in order to ensure the best cost basis. This type of trading is best suited for dividend stocks. 

The only thing you can control when trading stocks/options, is your entry price. So you better make sure you have the best plan for your entry and have a plan for any way a stock may move.

15-07-18,3dqz7t,Thoughts on climate change / global warming on global economy and 401k ?,"Hello Redditors

I have been diligently saving in my 401k for the past 5 years. Employer match is an added bonus and I try to save as much as i can. I also opened a vanguard mutual fund and setup automatic payments. Small contributions but it added up over time and I am pretty happy with those decisions. 

Been following some advise here, so thanks to all your wonderful suggestions!

Now that I got my savings part figured out finally, I am worried about the effects climate change will have on the economy. Unless anyone is living  under a rock, the weather changes and reduction in fresh water is alarming. Been reading some articles on how the economy will be damaged in the next 20-30 years. Part of me thinks that 401k and mutual funds might be ok now, but it not wise to keep it through till I retire. Other part of me thinks to just go for an investment properly because rent prices will keep going up and I will have a decent income from it if I have a good enough property portfolio. 

I guess I am just confused and don't understand these economics :) do you have similar thoughts?  ",19

Anyway, it's a very undiscovered / interesting / unique play (esp. on a Canadian exchange), and lots of potential upside, either via acquisition, their consumer facing product growing exponentially once it's online, or a bubble forming in private space stocks (and there aren't that many).

Happy YOLOing and look forward to your thoughts!

Hey all you earnings yoloers:  Don't forget about TSLA on 7/29.  the earnings might not be such a big deal, but an update on stationary batteries will be.  

-During the last conference call, Elon eluded to 'powerpack' preorders.  He described the order  number as ""bananas"".

-The batteries can slash utility bills by a jaw dropping 20-30% for major companies, like walmart.  This is a no brainer for major retailers and power generators, because of the relative ease of calculating ROI.  The batteries are essentially 'plug and play'.

-Making cars is very hard and takes a long time to grow.  For all the enthusiasm, TSLA has an astounding 5 years of car production baked into the stock price.  The gigafactory is ahead of schedule and batteries will even begin shipping Q3.  impatient wallstreet investors will like this.

-During the shareholder meeting, elon announced that the powerwall batteries will be significantly cheaper to install with more kWh for the same price.  this didn't get much attention, but it's a major step forward in linking them to solar and wind.

-There are supposedly surprises about the model X that have yet to be revealed.

- TSLA is on track to be cash flow positive in Q4.

-Model 3 announced in just 9 months now.

-For all the negativity it gets, TSLA is a great stock.  If you pay close attention to why it moves, it's very possible to predict and get sik gainz.

15-07-18,3drs6s,Reliable and accurate real-time quote streaming apps?,"Is there one in particular that day-trader's would have the most faith in? (given that they aren't using a terminal)

I would continue using Google Finance, but I have very little confidence in the information they display now, and the following blurb sort-of explains why:

*I'm aware that Google has the subscription necessary to receive and stream live NASDAQ/NYSE quotes, but when I compare Google Finance's latest price-quote of any moderately-actively traded stock to my brokerage company's real-time stock quotes, they're different.

I know my brokerage company's quotes are more correct as well, as my transaction receipts throughout the day reflect the quotes according to what my brokerage company sees as the live stock prices.

And although I wanted to believe that Google Finance's quotes were just lagging and would self-adjust eventually, it strangely doesn't until the market closes (or when the stock's closing price of the day is set).*

15-07-19,3dswz1,"The Biggest Load of BS in UNP's 2014 Annual Report","&gt;Our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments. Approximately 93% of the recorded liability is related to asserted claims and approximately 7% is related to unasserted claims at December 31, 2014. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims, it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately $335 million to $368 million. **We record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other.** Estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation. 

This defies common sense and the laws of probability. If the future costs can range from $335M to $368M, and no costs within the range is more probable than any other, then $351.5M is the expected value. 

Math = (335 + 368) / 2 = $351.5

Here I'll prove it. A dice has a range between 1 and 6. No dice roll is more probable than any other. Therefore, my expected value is 3.5.

Math = (1 + 6) / 2 = 3.5

I realize that discrepancy between the $351.5M they should be using and the $335M they are using seems rather petty. But here's the thing. Balance Sheets are not hard numbers. Theyre estimates. Inventories, accounts receivables, liability provisions, etc. They're estimates.

And if this is any indication of how UNP estimates, then their books are as good as fiction.

15-07-18,3drw0b,Conflict about portfolios in taxable account,"Hey all,

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I currently have a Roth IRA, 401k, and HSA whose asset allocations are basically 54% US / 36% Int'l / 10% Bonds. The horizon on those accounts is 30+ years. I'm considering the following two hypothetical assent allocations for my taxable account, which has a horizon of around 22 years:

**Allocation 1:**

* 60% VTI (Total Stock Market)
* 40% VXUS (Total Int'l)


**Allocation 2:**

* 20% VTV (Large Cap Value)
* 20% VOE (Mid Cap Value)
* 20% VBR (Small Cap Value)  
* 20% VWO (Emerging Markets)
* 20% VSS (Int'l Small Cap)

While I appreciate the simplicity of the two fund portfolio, no matter what 20-year period I backtest, the value/small cap/emerging markets tilted portfolio does significantly better, although there are individual years where it does substantially worse. Even though past performance doesn't guarantee future performance, intuitively it would seem that allocation 2 would do better in the long run due to higher growth potential and higher risk. 

Am I missing something completely obvious here? ",0

15-07-18,3ds1a5,Why is it so common to recommend domestic-tilted equity allocations?,"Most of the allocation recommendations I see on this sub (and a few other places) steer people in the U.S.  towards allocations to US equity far exceeding 50% of total equity exposure -- e.g., 70% VTI and 30% VXUS within the equity bucket. Why? The U.S. Is only 51% of the world by market cap, it's more correlated with a typical U.S. investor's labor income than VXUS (which would argue for tilting away from the U.S. if expected returns and volatilities were equal), and since it's more highly correlated with the component regions of VXUS than they are to each other, a risk-weighted equity allocation would have an even less US exposure. 

What gives? Is it just a historical holdover from a time when international holdings were more expensive? A fundamental view that the U.S. will outperform the rest of the world? Currency?  ",9

15-07-18,3ds7ua,What Can Be Learned,"I have now hit my 3 month mark on this subreddit (posting) and probably make up about a little less then half of the total posts. Since joining I do not think anything has actually changed in terms of quality of posts. Based on what I have seen, most people are in and out within a few weeks. 


A few things I have picked up:

* There is a lot of spam- People will just post tickers asking for opinions on them while at the same time provide 0 context as to why they are asking. In a way it is funny, they will say ""what is your opinion on FREE"" then they say nothing after that.

* Little to no moderation- Not a bad thing tbh, just kind of strange how barely any posts ever get removed even if someone is spamming/trolling. Hell, I am confident a post can stay on the front page for at least 12 hours when it contains porn, malware, or just a screamer.

* People rarely stay- Obviously this is something I kinda figured would happen. Most people brag about making a killing on 1 stock and are losing on the rest. Long story short they lose all their money in their accounts and have no interest in gambling/pennystock trading after that. Maybe 5% of the people still posting posted at least a few times 3 months ago.

* Gamblers thought process- Too many people are simply gamblers on here. Unfortunately people are too busy asking about stupid sub pennystocks instead of educating themselves on how options work. What I mean is, why trade a sub pennystock when you can trade options? Seriously, the risk is realistically a lot lower and your potential gains are about the same. Only problem is, options take more research and a better understanding of how stocks move. Hell, why not just play online blackjack if you are looking to make a killing?

* Lastly the quality of posts- Not shocking at all, but the quality of posts is actually insanely low. Most people on here simply do not understand what they are talking about. This will result in clueless traders telling newbie traders what to do (""investing in OTC stocks is great choice"").

15-07-20,3dwcu2,Convince me that institutional investors have a edge over retail investors.,"I consistently hear how institutional investors have an edge over us mere mortal retail investors. I'm not buying it though and I don't think it's a good excuse for passive investing. If you believe in efficient markets or you don't have the time to properly invest than those are legitimate reasons. The common arguments for institutional investors are as follows:

1. Informational advantage. Due to the size and influence of institutional investors they have better access to management than retail investors. This is true, but how much extra knowledge are they really gleaning from these meetings? There has never been greater transparency in the markets and the majority of management teams release stated objectives and do Q&amp;A every quarter. (Slight advantage to institutions)

2. Analytical advantage. Institutional investors have teams of analyst and years of experience in analyzing stocks. While this is true compared to the average retail investor it doesn't have to be true for every retail investor. There isn't something that makes institutional investors inherently better stock pickers. Having met several of them there are some very smart people but not all of them are rocket scientist. This is investor specific. (Neutral)
3. Activist advantage. Due to the size and influence of institutional investors they can take activist positions at companies in order to drive shareholder growth. This is a pretty clear advantage though only applicable for a subset of companies. (Advantage institutions)
4. Technological advantage. Some hedge funds engage in high frequency trading and other strategies that involve fast reaction time. This is an advantage but once again only for a subset of trading strategies. Future regulation may limit the effectiveness of this advantage. (Advantage Institutions)

Now let's review some of the major disadvantages institutional investors have to deal with:

1. Size of funds. Many institutional investors have assets ranging in the tens to even hundreds of billions of dollars. In order for those investors to have a diversified portfolio they need to focus on only the largest companies by market cap. There just isn't enough liquidity or impact to bother taking positions in sub billion dollar companies. Let's say most institutional investors are limited to the stocks available in the S&amp;P 500, though many would only be able to trade a fraction of that. That's 500 securities to choose from out of the near 9000 stocks listed in the US market. That's basically 6% of all available stocks that they can even look at. (Advantage retail investors)

2. Investor expectations and investor redemptions. If you're an institutional investor you don't have the luxury of waiting a couple years for your stock thesis to play out. You're judged on a quarterly basis and when your investors start to bail for the next hot thing you need to sell your investments today. That limits your ability to think long term and increases the need to follow the market. (Advantage retail investors)

In conclusion, while I think there are some advantages to being an institutional investor, especially in terms of influence, the disadvantages far outweigh the good. I think the majority of institutional investors would have much better returns if they were only managing a million dollars of their own money compared to billions for other people.",0

Sure, I don't have to pay tax when I withdraw it later, but wouldn't it be *better* to have it taxed later, when inflation makes the money worth less?  

The traditional IRA seems like a no-brainer, since you're keeping more money now when it's worth more. That's more money to make other business investments (I have somewhat of an entrepreneur mindset), more money for dividends in non-IRA accounts, etc. The compounded interest earnings over 40 years should be huge compared to any taxation, even if you take a penalty. Also, if you're going to be taxed on it no matter what, why not do it when the money is worth less, and having had more money working for you?",0

If it is positive, thus, profit is dependent on the companies' performance, if it is zero thus negative, the approach will be like poker thus the stock market needs to have some stupid people trading for it to be profitable, right?

I've read that when you sell your stocks, someone has to buy it. But how do you profit from that?
The general rule in trading is ""buy low, sell high"". Who will buy an expensive stock? A stock market fish? So does the stock market need to have a steady supply of fish to be profitable? (And will it slowly die like internet poker where people are getting better at the game the profits become smaller and eventually if everyone perfects it, it will be sure negative?)[I'm not saying online poker is dead, though ~ for online grinders]

So is the only positive EV/equity move in stock trading is buy it and hold it for long (It would just be like a bank with more risk. So you won't be able to make a living through stock trading but only slow investments?) and let the fish throw away their money?

I don't find any definitive description of stock market anywhere. It's always strategy this strategy that without examples of specific events and numbers and vague descriptions and motivational words.

I've only been curious about this yesterday (2 days) and googling everything i can think of, so if this looks stupid for some forgive me but I need a clearer image for this to feed my curiosity.",14

15-07-20,3dwpj1,"When a public company grants an employee stock options who ""pays"" for its time value?","An employee stock option grant can give the employee ""skin in the game"" by aligning the performance of the firm with the employee. 

If the firm does well and the stock rises above the strike price, the employee can exercise their options and gain the difference between the market price and the original strike price. If the firm does poorly or even muddles along and the stock price falls or goes nowhere, the options are considered worthless to the employee as there won't be any gain to exercising those options.

However, since most Employee Stock Option (ESO) grants last for at least a year or more (usually up to 10 years), the employee gets a tremendous benefit of time value embedded in those option grants. An option with a $100 strike price and a year's duration could cost $10 or more in the market for a $100 stock. An option with ten years of duration could approach the then current value of the stock alone.

What this means is that the firm is forgoing income every time it grants employee stock options because it could sell those options into the market instead.

For an S&amp;P 500 company, even though a company's cash flow is not reduced when it grants a CEO millions of dollars in stock options, it does not gain the benefit it could otherwise get by selling those same options to outside investors, meaning it does not collect the option premium by granting those call options to the executive.",1

15-07-19,3dv7tb,UA going into earnings [discussion],"While I believe this stock is a bit overpriced right now, im hoping that earnings gives me a better indicator for the future. My interest in the stock comes from the fact that they can only go up in terms of athletes and sportswear, as their top athletes Curry, Speith, and Harper are in the top 3 players in each of their sports, and at 27 curry is by far the oldest. I do not see them ever overtaking the beast that is nike, but i think they can make enough money to justify a large increase in their stock.

My other thought is that UA is gaining traction at the younger level, and so more and more athletes will sign on with them instead of nike.

15-07-20,3dx00q,Google is a boring company (from analyst perspective),"Google announced its Q2’15 results on 16th July (last Thursday). Its stock has surged nearly 16%. Investors are happy with the profits beating expectations and talks about the cost discipline from the new CFO. 

From an analyst perspective, Google is not a very interesting company. This is because there is not much to analyze after the earnings call. Google does not discloses much information to support assumptions or do any trend analysis. Here are 5 examples of data that would be very useful from an analyst perspective.

1. Sub-segment data. Google provides only top-level segment data. These segments are: Advertising revenue from Google sites; Advertising revenue from Google network member sites; and Other revenues.    Sub-segment level data is not provided. Examples include search vs Youtube video ads data from Google sites. Adsense for search/display, doubleclick ad manager, ad exchange data from Google network sites. Chrome notebooks sales, Nexus phone/tablet sales, chromecast sales, enterprise revenues etc. from Other revenues. 

2. More Geographic data. Google provides only US, UK, and International segments. No other geographic region or country-specific data is shared. 

3. Industry-level data. There are no talks about any industry-level data or trends for online advertising. Which industry is growing fast and which is growing slow.

4. Device-level data. There are no talks about mobile vs desktop vs tablet advertising revenues.

5. User-level data. There are not much disclosures related to users. For example, it will be interesting to know daily active users, monthly active users, mobile daily active users, mobile monthly users, mobile only users, DAU-to-MAU ratio for Google+. It will be interesting to know android adoption by region and free vs paid apps related information.

Google had $70 billion revenues on a LTM basis. Some companies having one-tenth of Google revenues share more information than it. I think SEC should make it mandatory for mega companies such as Google to disclose more information. 

What do you think?

If a stock opened at 100 and closed at 101 would you consider this roughly the same?  I'm working on percentages instead of dollar values since obviously $1 increase in price on a $5 stock is far more significant than the same increase on a $500 stock.

How can I insure that my financial/wealth management group doesn't ruin me? Or force me to sell my home?","To make a long story short I have about a million in a meryll account, I've read much of the paperwork and it sure seems like there fee's all over the place.

The person that I'm using was given to me by family, so I trust them, but I'm also worried since me and my family have some major disagreements on what to do with the money.

The account is fresh, and will likely need to be split up into something more complicated because of the mess of the situation it's become but more or less I intend on asking exactly what the distribution is, projection and etc?

I generally know very little about this sort of thing, but really wanted to get into self-directed. How would I start doing that? I imagine my wealth advisor will rather advise me and take his cut (I'm very cynical... maybe there all nice guys.....)

Most of my money is tied up with with the investment account now, but can I just take it out like any other bank if things dont work out? Could some spike in the last 30 minutes ruin me? See I really don't know a thing about this sort of stuff... I tried to read about it but there was far to much going on for much of it to stick.

That's why I'd like to start doing something self-directed so I can see what my wealth managment guy is doing and see what I'm doing with my micro account or something and learn.

I have major desires for exactly how I'd like this cash to work for me, and I'm not sure there possible so I'll talk those over with the wealth advisor? But how can I make sure he's good? I trust my family, and they gave him to me.... but I know he lost money in the crash and thats what I'm half woried about.

The other half I'm worried about is my home. It's going into a trust that's also managed by this same wealth manager, I am the trustee, but my remaining family is the trustor. This makes me very worried that there going to suddenly use it as an asset and tell me I have to sell it. They've already insisted that selling it would be the best idea, but then I have no home....... I would like to rent it, and think it possible.


But if the home is in the wealth managment account then what kind of control does that give them over my home? I'm very confused by the whole situation since there isn't any money in the actual account for the home, just the home. There was supposed to be some but apparently it was illegal to put insurance money into the account so it all went into my personal account.

Now besides my managed account that I'll be getting more details about soon (I'm assuming it's 1%..... but I was never actually told in person, and there numerous numerous different types of fees and when there charged.

15-07-20,3dy9r5,Trying to create 5k/month retirement income for my parents,"My parents own a couple raw-land properties (immovable assets). The properties appreciate in price, but they don't get much profit from that. I would like to create a stable $5k/month retirement income for my parents by pulling money out of their properties and investing into something with recurring income.

This may also give me (and others) idea around how much money do we need to put aside to generate stable income for retirement.


**Here are the options I am thinking about:**

1) Create a CD (maybe the worst idea).

Put $3million in the bank at 2% CD get $5k/month.

2) Buy rental properties

Around $2.5 million in houses/condominiums could generate $5k in income after expenses in my area. I live in Southern California, so properties are expensive but getting renters isn't a problem (can easily get 90%+ occupancy). Properties would also be a hedge against inflation.

3) Put money into Index Funds

Hope market goes up and keep cashing out stocks as needed. If market keeps growing at around 8% (has been for last 20 years avg). Need estimated $750k. (Sounds too good to be true compared to other options, am I missing something?)

15-07-20,3dybfp,[Question] regarding NASDAQ:AMD,"Hello,

I have a question regarding possible investment in AMD's. 

For a while now, AMD has been one of the largest global suppliers of semiconductors (GPUs, x86 CPUs), but it seems to suffer from overwhelming competition coming their way from Intel (dominator of gaming CPUs market) and Nvidia, among others. 

AMD's share prices took 2 significant hits this July, specifically on the 7th and on the 17th. [Google finance graph for reference.](https://i.imgur.com/MrPDLBk.jpg) 

Being an amateur and low-time investor, AMD seems to me like a honeypot for future investment. I'm pretty sure they won't go under any time soon, seeing that they're pretty active behind the scenes, especially private development contracts with major names.

On the other hand, their share-price trend is very worrying, especially that [AMD is now worth 1/4th of what the company bought ATI for 9 years ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/3dxq56/amd_now_worth_14th_of_what_the_company_bought_ati/) I don't know how clear-cut this is, but it certainly doesn't bode well.

My question is: what reasons would you raise against buying AMD shares in its current state, and (for the more experienced users) have you seen a company (tech sector) recover from a downward trend and turn things around in a relatively short period of time? (6 months - 1 year)",9

I was originally thinking of just putting 100% of my contribution into a target date fund, but I've heard a bit about what some other folks are doing and I'm considering a similar approach. One such allocation I've heard about is as follows, all investments at 10%:

Natural Resources  (FMFTX)

REIT (TRREX)

Large CAP    (PRGFX)

Medium CAP  (VIMSX)

Small CAP  (NAESX)

Bio Tech (JAGLX)

Emerging Foreign Markets  (VEIEX)

Foreign (VTRIX)

US Bonds (VBIIX)

Non US Bonds (PFODX)

I'm not sure what exactly the benefit is of buying into small/mid/large cap individually, versus a stock similar to VTSMX.

First off here's a link to their [10-k filing](http://api40.10kwizard.com/download.php?ipage=10131277&amp;subsid=41&amp;xls=1)
Their share price has been gutted in the last year and down 98% since 2008. 

I'm kinda new to trading and have no background checking company details so i'm not sure i'm interpreting the data correctly. But to me it seems they've got solid assets, with a new drillship under construction for 2016 completion. They're working on extinguishing debts are have shown positive change in reducing operating and administrative costs and 2014 was the first year since at least 2010 they've turned a net profit. Can someone more experienced tell me i've got this all wrong? I'm from the UK, not used to looking up SEC stuff but it seems to me like i'm onto a winner?

That article is from 2012 and the correlation has diverged even more significantly more since then. 

Also, [bond yields are a leading indicator of money velocity](http://www.philipji.com/item/2014-04-02/the-velocity-of-money-is-a-function-of-interest-rates). And the Fed has been talking about raising rates for the past 6 months.

So the process should be:  
Step 1: Raise rates (indicating that recent low rates/stimulus is having an effect on lending)  
Step 2: Money velocity increases further  
Step 3: Markets increase  
Step 4: Profit  

Except that the links between all of these steps have been broken for the past few years. Low rates have not pushed up money velocity, and velocity has been moving opposite the stock market.


Could it be that money coming from emerging markets is messing up these traditional monetary correlations?

* The decline of driving as a profession
* Cheaper shipping costs

* The ability for workers to be productive during commutes
* Smaller police forces
* A decline in automobile ownership for individuals

15-07-21,3e0zig,"Advice for Parents, please","Hello,


I don't think I've posted this before, at least not with all of the information at hand. Basically my Grandmother passed away early last year. Assets were sold and my Mother was given a nice chunk of change after all was said and done. Somewhere in the ballpark of $500,000. With this she was able to retire and collects a pension and collects social security. My Father also collects social security and works. My Mom is 63 and my Dad is 64... I believe. I'm bad with birthdays and ages.


As of right now they've given me access to their investment account to look it over. They're using a Financial Adviser at Capital One Investing. They also have other funds in a checking and savings account, but that's another story.


Here's what they have their money invested in:

BNDX	Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund ETF Shares
	
VXUS	 Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund ETF Shares	
	
VTI	Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ETF Shares	

BND	Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund ETF Shares


They also have money in the ""Nuveen Real Asset Fund Class C"", having over a thousand shares.


So far they have lost money on their portfolio, to the tune of ~$1,500. I believe that includes whatever fee this Adviser had (I wasn't with them at the time).


It seems that what is weighing them down is the Vanguard Total Bond Market. I know more about stocks than bonds, personally.


They are looking for relatively safe growth. They have the money in the savings account and they wanted to try and take on SLIGHTLY more risk with this other money. They are debt free -- mortgage and all. I figured an S&amp;P500 Index Fund would be a good spot to have a chunk of money in and maybe even go in on some individual blue chip stocks. But you guys know much more than I do, so I am coming to you for advice.


Thank you.",1

I have been reading about the markets and stocks for months and recently I have started making a few picks. What sort of things do you guys check before making a final decision on a stock to buy. I am not looking to day trade, I want to focus on stocks I think will grow over the next few months to years. 

I know looking out for major news events is important, but are their indicators you guys use that seem to be an important part of you decision to buy? Or do you stick to more of the basics of earnings reports and debts? Any advice would be appreciated.  ",5

I currently use wall street survivor to do make believe trading for practice. and do not plan on using real money until I am comfortable.  I realize that a cheap stock indicates that the company is not going up and shold not be bought. However what about the times where there is a sudden sharp decrease in a stock. Would this be a good time to buy. Do prices usually get back on track after this sudden dip?  Or is that a red flag in itself?  Thanks,18

Unlike other vice etfs and lists I tried to focus on a more blended rather than a pure value play to enable some more growth long term. I also attempted to find companies that wouldn't traditionally be thought of purely as VICE (Firearms, Tobacco, and Alcohol) but rather to branch out into any product/service that is high margin, and most importantly has an addictive product. I also tried to find companies with limited retail exposure and instead to focus on distributors, even though I do have a few retail oriented companies on this list. I avoided companies that were mega-cap and tried to focus on growing mid and large cap US companies with stable growth and that tended to perform well during the 2009 crash since VICE portolios are often designed to be defensive. Anyways as a frequent r/investing lurker I am interested in having a discussion on VICE companies and to discover some new ideas/companies/strategies that I can follow up on over the next two years with DD so that I will be in a better position to start my retirement portfolio at that juncture.

15-07-21,3e4bkq,"Understanding Chapter 20 (Margin of Safety) of ""The Intelligent Investor""","I am reading the ""margin of safety"" chapter of ""The Intelligent Investor"" by Ben Graham. I have problems understanding the book's description of what a margin of safety for a common stock investment actually is. I know the ""buy the dollar for 80 cents"" explanation of margin of safety and I am familiar with value investing and the concept of intrinsic value but none of it is explicitly mentioned in this chapter. So my problem is that I cannot relate the concepts from the chapter to the value investing concept that I know from other resources. 

To be more precise, in the chapter two concepts for the margin of safety for common stocks are mentioned. 

(1) ""... the amount of outstanding stock is selling below the amount of bonds that could safely be issued against its property and earning power."" I assume this translates into market cap. below working capital or net asset value but I cannot make a clear connection. Why should I think about the amount of bonds that could be issued? Isn't it more important to look at the amount of debt that is already in the balance sheet and compare it to the available assets?

(2) ""The margin of safety lies in the expected earning power considerably above the going rate for bonds."" I assume the rationale is that margin of safety stands for the decline in earning power that could occur before the earnings drop below that of a bond. Which makes sense but I do not see how this is safeguarding against a decrease in the stock price.",16

15-07-21,3e27sj,Why 13-F filings are poor for replication,"I've seen hedge fund and trader replication ETFs and strategies for some time now and I realized a lot of them are based on 13-F filings. I thought I would go into why these are poor for replication. I hope it's helpful for some readers out there. And in case I miss something, please feel free to add some more points.


1) They aggregate the positions of many different people

Typically the funds they replicate often have a Portfolio Manager structure. Just like with mutual funds you have many different types of funds, on the hedge fund side, you have something similar except you have a ton of different individuals. The 13-F filings are an aggregation of the entire fund so you are seeing the aggregated thesis of the entire fund. You may also be looking at the position of a portfolio manager who fundamentally looks at the world entirely different than you and understands the company in a context you may not. Some people may view this has ""crowdsourcing"" within hedge funds, but then I present a couple other points.

2) They are delayed

The filings are quarterly so you are getting lagging data. It's not uncommon for a fund to change positions every month. If you are using 13-F filings, make sure the fund has very long holding periods to account for this. Even then, if there is market-moving news, you wont really know their position until the next report.

3) They show you an incomplete picture

A long/short equity fund will often have a short component. Traders often use pairs trades, or short trades to come up with a trade structure. 13-F filings though only represent the long position. 

For example the 13-F filings may be long comcast, when the fund could also be short Timewarner against it. Both companies make up the trade thesis. So even if Comcast loses money, they may be making money on the entire trade as Timewarner was the other leg of the trade. It may appear they are ""in it for the long haul"" when really you can only see one side of the trade. It's true long/short equity funds tend to make more money on the long side, but some of that is beta exposure. 


What I have used 13-F filings for

1) Trade idea generation. Sometimes smaller hedge funds will find stocks that I haven't heard of. I will do my own research though and form my own thesis. It's almost like a screener I suppose. If I know if a hedge fund is a value fund, a long position may be a value position.

2) To get a hf gig

In college I would look up 13-F filings for local small hedge funds, then research the companies, and cold E-mail hedge funds to discuss the idea. This tended to be received well. 

Did I miss anything?

**EDIT:**

Here is what commenters added - please make sure to give them the karma they deserve

**sayitlikeyoumemeit**
&gt;Yes, 13-F following works best for idea generation from funds with very concentrated portfolios and known for mostly long positions.
One metric that isn't used much that I like to estimate is the % of overall shares of a particular company that the fund holds (not the % it represents of their own portfolio) . This may give you an even better sense of their conviction in the business. When they start owning close to 20% of a company (many don't go over this limit because of poison pill arrangements and filing requirements), it implies a high level of conviction, even if it's a relatively smaller portion of their overall portfolio.

**Mephiska**
(Expanding upon delayed releases)
&gt;Not only that, they will often wait the full 45 day time limit after quarter end to file, so when you see that report you're already looking 45 day old data.

15-07-21,3e4wjn,Residual Income Model for AAPL,"I just finished reading the excellent [Financial Statement Analysis and Security Valuation](http://amzn.to/1TOQyua) by Richard Penman and using the textbook as a guide, decided to build my own Residual Income Model in excel for one of the stocks I own, AAPL.

Based on my model (which I fully admit is not the be-all end-all of insight, and I fully acknowledge my model can 100% be wrong), I'm getting a share price of $107/share (using a 10% discount rate). So to me, feels like AAPL is fairly priced at the moment, though I tend to be very conservative with my future estimates. 

The piece I'm struggling with is how to account for buybacks in the model, so I was curious if anyone has any suggestions for doing so? Should I just lump them in with dividends and assume a future payout ratio combining the two, or does it make sense getting into the nitty gritty of shares outstanding by reformulating the shareholders equity statement (which I've currently done)?

If anyone is interested, you can find a link to download the model [here](http://www.valueiswhatyouget.com/blog/2015/7/21/residual-income-model) and I'm 100% open to it being shared in the hopes that others will improve it and provide feedback. ",1

15-07-21,3e32r7,"A note about options, leverage and certainty of death","Alright kids, gather around. It's story time. 

I was meaning to write about this for the last 3 years (ask the folks in chat) but I finally broke yesterday when someone's mind was blown that % rules apply to stocks or something. Today's topic will be about options, penny stocks and how not to mix them up as I often see here. 

Perfectly good money disappears in the game of options and penny stocks, in which the only winner is your broker. First let me clear up what I mean by penny stock: I am not talking about OTCs, I'm talking about [Penny Stocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_stock), things like like AMD or NBG. In fact when I talk about penny stocks I talk about shit that's under $20 / share, which for the purposes of options is a good threshold to use. 

I thought about this last night and decided to go with an analogy using Torque. Imagine that you're hiking through the desert with a friend and a massive boulder lands on your leg. You quickly ask your friend to find a strong wooden stick to jimmy under the rock and use it as leverage to lift the massive rock.  Given this situation, your friend asks you: ""but Walter, there are two kinds of sticks, there are very long ones measuring 30 feet long and very short ones measuring 1 inch long. Which of the two should I use?""  

In this situation, if Walter was from WSB he would surely reply ""the short one! Yolo.""  And as much fun as it is to say yolo, Walter would die with a 100% probability of his friend goes for the 1 inch stick. What Walter really needs is the use of some serious leverage. 

In this case Torque is defined as t = r * f where *t* is torque, *r* is the length of the wooden stick and *f* is force. The longer the stick is, the more torque or leverage you get. In our case we will apply the same formula to options and re-define *t* to be the money you stand to make, *r* will be the price of the underlying stock and *f* will be your money used to make the trade. The bigger the *r* (price of underlying) is the bigger your profits will be. 

To illustrate this I made two pictures using a high quality and complex financial graphing tool:

http://i.imgur.com/Q8qUzW7.png

I'll explain. In red, purple and green we have the amount of money you stand to make if you buy an AMD, MCD, and BRK.A call that's in the money and about to expire in 3 minutes. Ceteris paribus, you can see that a 1% move in the each of the underlying stocks can make you $1, $100, or $216,000 respectively. I'll repeat. If your stock moves 1% then you stand to make anywhere between $1 and a quarter million dollars with a single call option contract. Below you will see the relationship between the price of the underlying and what you stand to make given a 1% move in your underlying:

http://i.imgur.com/QP23CBT.png

This math is exacting. You can either make zero money or infinite money. It's up to you. Even if you correctly guess the direction and magnitude of the stock move you go home broke or richer than god.

Q: But jartek, you forgot to mention that the expensive stocks also have expensive options! I'm poor and can't afford a BRK.A call option. 

A: Very good Walter. I forgot to mention this. But the fact that you're poor is likely because you're buying options on penny stocks. If you want to get out of the rat race, stop throwing your money away. 

Q: No but seriously, I wish I could but it's too much money and I don't have it

A: ok Walter. Let's put it this way. Given that you're poor, you probably don't have options trading for cheap commissions. At best you can probably get $1/contract trade (each way), or $2/contract round trip. If you were to make the AMD trade illustrated above, using 100 contracts. Then your 1% move will make you a total of $100, minus the $200 commissions for the trade, you will be negative $100 after the trade.  Commissions in this case is made up of 200% of your profits. If on the other hand, you were to make the same 100x contract trade with BRK.A, the same 1% move will make you $21,600,000 dollars (twenty one point six million). If you use the same commissions structure, you will pay $200 for the trade, in which case commissions make up of 9.259x10^-^6, or 0.0009% of your profits. A much smarter investment decision.  If you keep trading options of pennies you will die a poor man Walter. 

Let's look at it in terms of RoR. In AMD the f'(x)=0 and in BRK.A f'(x) = infinite.  Let's say the AMD ITM call costs you $50. Then RoR = 0/50 = 0.  And let's say BRK.A the ITM call contract costs you $10,000 then RoR =  infinity/100000 = infinite .  So once again, measured in terms of risk, you can either make nothing relative to your risk or make infinite relative to your risk. 

In seriousness, you don't have to go to BRK.A to make money. Just avoid penny stocks. Look at my second illustration to help you decide where on the spectrum of profit making you want to be at and what you can afford. But no matter how poor you are, you can NEVER afford to lose all your money. This is what will happen with penny stock options. 

Q: Yes jartek but what about the fact that you also stand to lose more money with your leveraged options on expensive stocks?

A: the answer will be the same as above. If you are to lose the bet, then yes the BRK.A trade will lose you a lot of money. But with the AMD trade *you will lose all of it*. So no matter how you look at it, losing all of your money is less than losing a lot of money. And also losing all of your money is worse than making a lot of money. No matter how you look at it it is lose-lose. Options of penny stocks will lose you all of your money with 100% guarantee. In fact this is part of the Black-Scholes equation.  It's in paragraph 6 section 2 sentence 9 ""if you use options on pennies you will end up homeless and die lonely [sic].""

Q: ok, ok. But what about yolo?

A: Walter, with options on pennies the saying would be yodo. You only die once. And suicide is for cowards. Don't suicide. It's bad for your health and your mom will be sad. Tell your friend to get a long stick and move the massive rock to set you free.

Yesterday was a sad day for me, hated myself for not even trying to check news on positions I was selling.

Question: Can anyone tell me how much did I loose by selling 100 stocks on friday instead of holding them few more days.

I know this will not help, but trying to make sure I learn the lesson.

15-07-22,3e8bzy,IB margin account question,"I apologize for noob question but I cannot seem to find a definite answer. IB's reps did not really answer my question or maybe i did not made it clear enough. So far, I understand that in a margin account, I can do round-trips with my cash without having to worry about unsettled funds but I must follow PDT rule( 25k minimum if more than 3 rounds/ 5days, margin reg initial reg, etcs). I have a scenario.
Let's say I have 10k cash in my account and currently not holding any positions. 
Day 1: I do one round trips and spent all 10k. 
Day 2: I do another round trip about 10k also. Will my broker charge me interest for this round trip since my 10k cash from Day 1 has not settled? 
Second scenario:
Assume on Day 2: Instead of doing the round trip. I bought stock for value about 10k and sold it on Day 3. Any margin interest?

15-07-21,3e39yu,Correct formula for calculating bond returns?,"Can someone check my math? Suppose an N-year bond is purchased when interest rates are R1 and held for one year after which interest changes are R2.  This is the formula I derived from my head:

    (1+R1)^N / (1+R2)^(N-1)

So if the interest rate on 10-year bonds changes from 2% to 3% after one year, the return over that year is -6.57%. Is this right?

I initially started out this morning with the intention of investing into a lower-risk portfolio and letting it sit to grow. With this in mind, my portfolio now plays out like this:

5 shares each in NFLX and DIS
10 shares in AAPL--&gt; I chose this specifically because many have said that it's a good buy-in time for Apple. I don't see Apple dropping continuously, but the slump in the last couple days has bumped the price down to a comfortable pricing.
3 shares in FIT--&gt; This is where I'm getting closer to speculation. Just bought a Fitbit and love the product, definitely see it going further in the future. 

Here is my current dilemma. My parents are encouraging me to mess around with the market to try to make some (relatively) big money before school starts again (read: invest in riskier companies), at which point I will put the majority of my money into more stable companies e.g. AAPL, NFLX, what have you. 

I plan on injecting into my account a further 2-4000$ to play around with, as they have promised a level of ""insurance"" to essentially recoup my losses. 

I know that at my age it's ok to be investing in riskier firms. However, I'm curious as to where there is a limit? Is it ok for me to be about 50/50 on safe/risky positions? If so, what are some more up-and-coming stocks to look at?

edit: I am definitely in both runs, short and long as i'm 23 yo.

my thought, looking only at the last two years, is that the price will drop to around its 52 week low. sometime in the next 60 days this stock will be back down around $200. I've already seen 45% gains since april. 

I'd be stupid not to sell high when I know for certain it will drop. ""What goes up must come down.""

15-07-22,3e8qoe,Why Buying OTC Pumps Is Bad,"Buying pumps
-
A few days ago I made a post pretty much saying it is extremely reckless and fooling to buy THCZ (this was at the peak of the pump). Little did I know how much people disagreed with it. I really was shocked and explained myself saying that it is too unpredictable. I can understand why they didn't get what I mean because I might not have been specific enough. 

So refer back to this post anytime you are thinking about buying a pump. First off, and most important, you are getting in with no set ""risk"". When you buy in, there is absolutely nothing fueling the stock price going up other than newsletters. You are at mercy to eveyone else's emotion and profit taking ways. At any point (literally any second) the stock could snap and collapse, which it did. Now you might be saying ""oh well what is the difference with shorting, shouldn't that be the same""? Yup you are right if you are thinking this. You can refer to stocks like VLTC and GENE which are 2 short killers. However, shorting pump and dumps is generally a lot safer because there are a lot of sheep in the stock. 


**""What do you mean sheep?""**. Simple really, they get in the stock strictly because a newsletter told them to or because it is a ""hot pick"". These kinds of people are trading with such emotion that at any point if one group sells off, every does. 

And a common thing I get is: ""well you profit, so what is the big deal"". It isn't my money, but if you go into a casino and come out winning, will you always? No obviously not, and this is what I mean. It IS luck, there is very little strategical trading going on when you are buying a pump and dump and praying it will go up. 

**""Oh whats the difference between your trades and buying a pump?""**. Simple, I take a strategical approach based on solid evidence that a stock is going up/down. Saying a pump will go up from the point you buy it is like saying VLTC will go down when you short it. 


**""Why don't you just short it then?""**: most pumps are actually too cheap to short, the 2.50 rule would kill any chances to trade them. Honestly, you shouldn't short a sub-pennystock anyway (or buy one but that is a whole separate thing). If the stock is well over a dollar and is a pump (not all pumps are newsletter based too) then I will short it. But not randomly, I will not get in thinking ""it has to pull back now"", I get in when it shows it can't break anymore.

**""You think you know everything, my trade wasn't luck""**. I hear this the most. My reply to that is: what happens if the trade began to turn when you got in? I mean it is a OTC pump, most promoters are out in the morning or lateday. And also, I do not think I know everything. I just know that the success rate overtime of buying OTC pumps is insanely low. You have to have an ability to understand the right time to get in and out of these kinds of stocks. In case you guys do not know, most people on this subreddit do not tell you their losses. So obviously everyone is going to gain on THCZ, because almost everyone is a little liar. 

**""scalp pumps""** Again, it is just luck. You are basing your trade based on a little window where it is a 40-60 chance it will go up. Why 40-60? Because if you get in, emotions will play a factor and instantly put you at lower chances of holding a trade. You need to get in with a set risk, a plan, and a real strateg.

**""Well isn't this how it is with all stocks? Why does it being a pump matter?""**. Referring back to what I said about, you have a lot more ""sheep"" in the stock where one small jolt down could set off a chain reaction. It happens to a much greater effect on a pump and dump (hint: that is where the dump part comes from). Doesn't happen with pretty much any stocks but pumps.

In the end it is your money, I am not telling you what to do. I am just saying what I would avoid doing under all circumstances.

The exception is if we have a great earnings quarter, in which case the SPY will stay high or might even go up a bit. I think this is unlikely and the SPY will move down in the short term. It's been around the 205-213 range for a while.

With this info, I'm looking for some overvalued stocks to short. Not FB or UA as they're going into their earnings and the hype will keep these stocks strong. Maybe something like WBA which looks like it's peaking after it's earnings beat and might start to slip. I'll wait another day for confirmation on WBA.

Google did pay one small dividend to Goog holders in April but it was only 0.27%, not anything close to the current discrepancy of almost 5%!  So, what should I do?

Based on these trend lines I've drawn it appears that there is support at .04 and the downward trending line appears to crossing right into today's high. This makes me think that there are enough people watching this stock waiting to buy the dip. That and the volume.

Based on the news that I believe this stock is running off, I want to think that tomorrow will be a key point in whether or not this thing breaks into the .06 tier. Otherwise it may just float for a while. Even then it may not hold. I can't say for certain. 

Also the 3 day chart appears to be stair steppin.

15-07-23,3earpa,How Easy is it to Fix and Flip a House?,"Fix and flipping television shows do a decent job of portraying the process of a flip, but television shows can’t possibly show the entire process and what it takes to flip a home. I have fix and flipped close to 100 homes in the last ten years and I am working on nine fix and flips right now. It takes a lot of work, experience and time to learn to flip homes and make a profit. The profit is determined by many things besides the buy price, the repairs made and the selling price. Those sometimes forgotten costs are what determine if a flip will make money or lose money.

How do fix and flippers find and buy properties?
On most of the flipping shows, the flippers are buying properties at the foreclosure sale. Every state has a different foreclosure process with different rules and guidelines. At the foreclosure sale the bank sends in a minimum bid and if an investor wants to meet or beat that minimum bid they can buy the home for cash.

Buying at the foreclosure sale is very risky, because many times you cannot see the interior of a home or it may still be occupied by the previous owners or tenants. When you buy at the foreclosure sale you have to pay cash within hours of the sale or bring cash with you to the sale. The cash does not have to be a briefcase full of $100 bills, but it does need to be certified funds like a cashier’s check.

I used to buy 90 percent of my fix and flips at the foreclosure sale and a couple of times I got burned. In one instance I bought a house at the foreclosure sale and when we had it rekeyed we found a newer BMW in the garage. I knew something was wrong immediately and I contacted the previous owners who were in California (I am in Colorado). The previous owners claimed the banks foreclosed wrong and was suing the bank. They did not file the lawsuit until after the foreclosure sale and I had no way to know about the lawsuit until after I bought the home. I could not sell the home with an active lawsuit against it and it took over a year for a court to review the case. The court threw out the lawsuit after reviewing it, but I had to hire lawyers to speed up the process. I lost $10,000 on that flip because of the time it took to sell the property and my lawyer’s fees.

If you are wondering about the BMW, the previous owners came and got it. Another misconception about flipping is that the flippers get to keep whatever they find in a house. It is not legal to take whatever you find in a house after you buy it at the foreclosure sale. States have different laws, but in most instances if the value of the personal property left in the house is over $300 a personal property eviction must be done or the property must be stored for months to give the previous owners a chance to get it.

How do I find and buy fix and flips?
I stopped buying at the foreclosure sale because the competition has gotten so intense form other investors that prices are close to what they are on MLS (multiple listing service). I buy almost all of my properties from the MLS, which has its advantages.

I can see the entire house before I buy.
I can get a loan on the property; here is an article on how to finance a fix and flip.
I can do an inspection on the house, although many times I waive this to make my offer more appealing.
I have 15 to 30 days to close on a house instead of 2 hours.
I am a real estate agent so I get paid a commission on most houses I buy through MLS saving me thousands on each deal.
Many people think it is impossible to get a great deal on the MLS in today’s market. My market is no different; our prices have gone up 20 to 30 percent in the last two years and our inventory is very low. I am not saying it is easy to find homes to flip; I check my MLS system five to ten times a day. There are many things I do to get great deals.

I write offers on properties within hours of seeing a good deal
I am very patient; it takes me months to see a good deal worth making an offer on
I invest in small towns where there is not as much competition
I buy houses that need a lot of repairs
What are the real costs of flipping a home?
On television, some shows do a decent job of listing the costs involved and others are horrible. My goal is to make at least $25,000 on each flip I complete and my average buy price is around $100,000. For me to make $25,000 on a flip that I buy for $100,000 I have to sell that house for close to $170,000. The reason I have to sell the flip for so much are the costs involved in flipping.

Buying costs: when you buy a home you have to pay closing costs and those can expensive with a loan. I would estimate I pay $2,000 on a $100,000 purchase.
Carrying costs: When you own a flip you have to pay utilities, take care of the lawn, hold insurance, pay HOA dues, pay interest on your loan and pay taxes. It takes me about six months to flip a house and those costs can easily add up to $5,000.
Repairs: Repairs are almost always more than I expect because you miss things when you see a house and repairs come up that were hidden until you start tearing stuff out. On a typical flip I expect to spend $15,000 on repairs, but I always add $5,000 for unknowns.
Selling costs: I am a Realtor so I save money by listing homes myself. Non agents would pay double the closing costs I would pay. With title insurance, closing fees, recording fees, buyer paid closing costs and real estate commissions I pay $10,000 or more in selling costs. A non agent would pay close to $15,000.
When you add those costs up the breakeven point to make money on your flip is $137,000. That leaves me with a $33,000 profit, which happens to be the average amount I made in 2013 on my fix and flips.

How do you repair a fix and flip?
When I repair my fix and flips I do not do any of the work myself. I hire contractors to do everything, because I have nine flips and there is no way I could do the work myself. If I had one flip I would still hire a contractor because of the time and money I save using a contractor. When I own a flip it costs me from $35 to $50 a day to own that property. If I tried to do the work myself it would take my months to finish a job that would take a professional weeks. That extra time would cost me thousands of dollars and all the money I thought I was saving by not hiring a contractor. On top of the job taking longer, it would not be done as well.

When I repair a flip here are the basics I always do

Make sure major systems work; electrical, plumbing, heating, roofing, etc.
Make sure it looks nice; new paint, new floor coverings, new appliances and new fixtures
 

I try not to make major changes in a floor plan or tear into walls unless necessary. When you make major changes, especially in older homes, you run into big problems. Simple remodels turn complete renovations when walls are taken down. Additions rarely ad enough value to a home to justify the cost either.

Conclusion
There is much more to flipping than what this article contains, but hopefully this lets you know the basic costs and what it takes to fix and flip a home. If you want to get into the flipping business, make sure you find great contractors, because that is by far my biggest headache.

15-07-23,3ec852,Canadian Man Pleads Guilty to Operating Boiler Room,"www.StockPromoters.com 

Sandy Winick, 57, pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit wire fraud for running a $5 million scheme in which investors in U.S. penny stocks were duped into paying fees for nonexistent services, prosecutors in Brooklyn, New York said on Friday.

According to court filings and facts presented during the plea proceeding, Winick was the leader of the multi-million-dollar scheme, which used call centers around the world to defraud victims. Winick, a Canadian citizen, was extradited from Thailand to face charges here.

Winick is the seventh defendant to plead guilty in this case to date. Nine defendants were charged in two related schemes that Winick led from 2008 through 2013. In the first scheme, several defendants, including Winick, were charged with engaging in an international pump-and dump operation, fraudulently inflating the share price of worthless penny stocks, and then dumping billions of shares on unsuspecting victim investors across the globe.

In the second scheme, the defendants, including Winick, were charged with operating boiler rooms in four countries, inducing investors in penny stocks, including many of the victims in the first scheme, to pay advance fees that the defendants promised would enable them to sell the stocks and recover any losses they incurred. In reality, Winick and his co-conspirators simply stole the fees without providing any services, fraudulently extracting more than five million dollars from their victims. As part of this scheme, Winick established and operated two boiler rooms or call centers in various locations around the world, including Canada, Thailand, and China, to solicit fees from the victims. Winick also planned to open a call center in Brooklyn.

The guilty plea was announced by Kelly T. Currie, Acting United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York and Diego Rodriguez, Assistant Director-in-Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation, New York Field Office (FBI).

If convicted, Winick faces up to twenty years in federal prison.",4

15-07-22,3e7375,What to do with 3 old stock certificates?,"So when I was a kid, my grandfather had a pretty cool idea of buying his grandchildren stocks for their birthday, and for 3 years in a row, he gave me a framed certificate and told me it would become more valuable over time.
For a few years, I received hilariously tiny dividend checks and they eventually stopped sending them. After speaking with my grandfather about it, he says that I might be able to collect these dividends somehow, and that the stock might have split since then. I have no idea how to go about figuring any of this out.
The shares in question have been hovering between about $115-$120 a piece in the last few months.
Now the stocks have become pretty valuable ($115-$120 per share) and I am wondering if it would be worth it to sell them, since I have the certificates.
Can I get any broker to sell 3 shares? Can I find my dividends somewhere? Is this even worth it? Please help!",43

The reasoning is this move will simply increase automation, so there is less of a need to hire workers.

15-07-23,3ecdvt,Crescent Hill Takes Top Paid Promotion Spot on Pink Sheets (PINK: DRMC),"www.StockPromoters.com 

Crescent Hill Capital Corporation (PINK: DRMC) is the object of a heavily financed promotional campaign this month. In fact, the company is shelling out so much cash, that it has taken over the number one position on the Pink Sheets as the most thickly promoted stock, nudging out Eagle Oil Holding (Pink: EGOH) by almost $14,000.

So far this month, DRMC has paid promoters Penny Stock Titans, Stock Freak, Penny Stock Circle, Stock Publisher, Penny Stock Crew, and StockMister a total of $62,000 combined to entice prospective investors. So why the hype? Is there really something we should know about this micro-cap that we’re missing out on? Seriously, Definitive Rest has been touted by promotional emails almost daily since the beginning of June, and not all of them paid.

One reason for the sudden interest could be a statement that DRMC released earlier this month saying that it would be adding carbon fiber materials to its line of manufacturing technology products. The company expects the market for carbon fiber to grow by 17 percent annually for the next five years, which means that the market can be at $7.3 billion by 2017.

Additionally, it updated shareholders on its sales, stating that it’s making progress in its new business direction and is getting results as expected. Sales have increased through a number of contracts for new products, resulting in a strong customer base. The company also revealed that it would meet its revenue predictions for Q3 2015, the first quarter after the company underwent a change in business direction and executive management team.

At the start of the year, the company abandoned its previous business and ventured into the Machine Tool and Metals Industry, Distributions and Sales. Financial results for the first quarter since the change in business plans did show a significant improvement over the same period last year.

On Tuesday, the company lost 5.56 percent, but that kind of price action has been a regular thing in the last few weeks. The higher volume, at 27 million, was more than double the daily average of 11 million, suggesting some sell-off from disappointed investors, but that might have been offset by equal buying pressure around $0.0015 levels, the lower boundary of the short-term range containing the entire price action in the last few weeks. The probability of this range continuation looks higher.

In today’s trading, DRMC is trading up by 16.67 percent and shares are selling for $0.0014, up from yesterday’s close of $0.001.
This trade is a mixed bag. It’s a roller coaster ride of ups and downs. And with so many changes in direction on the business front, it’s hard to tell exactly what DRMC does.

A risky play at best. Proceed with caution.",2

I think Buffett once said that an investor with an 150 IQ should sell 30 IQ points. Additionally, some people call him a ""3-sigma"" event, nothing more than a statistical aberration. 
I don't want to start another academic discussion of the EMH or the works of Nassim Taleb. Instead I would be grateful to read some subjective accounts about the importance of hard work and intelligence investing. 
To phrase my question differently: Assuming that the IQ is an accurate measure of intelligence, would a 200 IQ individual dedicated to investing almost certainly become very rich wiithout a huge starting capital and influence or connections ?

Although my knowledge of ""investing"" is extremely limited I am aware that  the question is very broad and that there could be huge differences between different approaches or areas of investing.

15-07-22,3e795q,Three Accused in Stock Spam Scam,"www.StockPromoters.com

Officials in Israel arrested two men on Tuesday charged in the U.S. with running a multimillion-dollar stock manipulation scheme. The arrests were part of a months-long investigation of a group of friends who met in college in Florida and are tied to the JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM) hack in 2011 and 2012, with suspects in Israel accused of security fraud for inflating the value of low-volume stocks.

U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara announced the arrests by the Israel police of a man from Savyon, Israel, and another from Bat Hefer, Israel. The men, Israeli nationals, were arrested at their homes. A third defendant, a U.S. citizen who lives in Moscow and Tel Aviv, remained at large.

Allegedly, the three men obtained shares in several penny stock companies and pumped the prices as high as 1,800 percent before dumping the shares for at least $2.8 million in illicit proceeds. In one extravagantly positive promotional e-mail about a particular stock, they stated that a $5,000 investment could be worth more than $250,000 in two years. The men used numerous corporate identities and developed at least 20 different stock promotion websites to con investors into buying the stocks and causing the spikes in trading volume and share price that spurred their schemes.

The SEC filed a complaint in federal court in Manhattan. It names Joshua Samuel Aaron (aka Mike Shields), Gery Shalon (aka Phillipe Mousset and Christopher Engeham), and Zvi Orenstein (aka Aviv Stein and John Avery). Aaron and Shalon allegedly wrote and designed the e-mails, Shalon allegedly disseminated them, and Orenstein allegedly provided essential operational support by handling brokerage accounts using numerous aliases. 

“These men allegedly manipulated the microcap market to make quick profits at the expense of unsuspecting investors, and they have been caught by law enforcement despite using aliases and other ploys in an attempt to cover their tracks,” said Andrew M. Calamari, Director of the SEC’s New York Regional Office.

In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges have been filed against the men involved.",5

However, a lot of people say that they understand the risk, and when it comes to it it, on average, if trading gives you better returns than your loan interest rate, you should in fact trade (that's a misleading simplification but its true).

Anyway, I just wanted to share that as of last week, I have officially paid off my graduate student loans with my graduate student loans. This is because I was taking out the max, around $10,000 a semester but only using about $5,000 toward school and using the rest to invest (theoretically I suppose I used it as living expenses and used my regular income to invest). Anyway, I more or less doubled my loan refund money through trading over the past two years and used it to pay off my balance entirely. Meaning I went to grad school for free essentially (not really since I put a lot of work and time into trading). 

So it is possible... Also, I do claim to know what I am doing but also realize that a lot of luck was involved given some uncharacteristic returns; my YTD return this year is around 85% and last years returns were around 28%.

Edit: Note that IMHO this is an absolutely stupid stupid thing to do, and I would never recommend it to anybody. I do however love to trade and follow the US stock market, so it worked for me so far... :/",6

15-07-22,3e7rjv,New North Carolina Law Sees Hemp Inc. Shares Jump Then Crash,"www.StockPromoters.com 

North Carolina Governor, Pat McCrory signed House Bill 766 into law Friday, July 17, 2015. Hemp, Inc. (PINK: HEMP) officials were excited that CBD/Hemp Oil is now legal in North Carolina, home to its decortication plant (a natural fiber manufacturing and processing facility).

According to the General Assembly of North Carolina Session 2015, the new legislation amends ""the exemption for use or possession of hemp extract and permitting the use of hemp extract as an alternative treatment for intractable epilepsy without participating in a pilot study and repealing the epilepsy alternative treatment act in 2012."" In other words, neurologists can recommend a hemp oil treatment to patients that suffer from intractable epilepsy without being part of a pilot study.

So what does this mean for North Carolina-based penny stock Hemp Inc.? The company focuses primarily on industrial hemp (over 25,000 products made from hemp that the hemp plant offers) and in creating a new, clean green American agricultural and industrial revolution. The Industrial Hemp and Medical Marijuana Consulting Company (IHMMCC) is a wholly owned subsidiary of the company that pulls industry information from a vast network of specialists. On September 25, 2014, its wholly owned subsidiary, Industrial Hemp Manufacturing, LLC (IHM), purchased and secured its permanent facility for the Temafa decortication line of equipment located in Spring Hope, NC.

Well, the news was good on Monday as the stock surged by 36 percent on unprecedented volume of more than 77 million shares. Then something happened. Yesterday, the stock took a dive, crashing by nearly 20 percent and closing at $0.0165. Further corrections could follow. Compared to its high of over 0.045 posted back in January the stock is currently sitting more than 58 percent down. It appears that investors are wising up to the risks surrounding the volatile micro-cap company, despite the new law enacted.

The latest quarterly report showed that for the first three months of 2015 HEMP has generated just $6223 in revenues. The net loss for the period was $1.08 million. However, the new law could help turn things around for the company. At least CEO Bruce Perlowin is aiming for that goal.

In today’s trading, HEMP is showing a further loss of 6 percent and is sitting at $0.0155 per. The company has a current market cap of $43.83 million. As with any micro-cap, this stock is highly volatile, but seems more so than usual at the moment.

15-07-22,3e7v3c,Twitter Feed and the Wolves approach for their earnings meal.,"Never forget, its a bull market you know. Wall Street thinks not of the high intentions to slowly monetize twitter without busting the masses balls. They want a profit.

 For a time has passed. This earnings catalyst effect, shall either quicken the blow of the wrath of Wall Street, or change their perspective all together. 

A mere 5 cents showing on earnings changes the fate of billions. either way. They have given Mr Costello his time. For they are an impatient pack of wolves, already invested in the hunt. What will earnings bring they ask? 

For they are hunting. And good at it they are. They are confident. The ones invested that is. The short sellers hate Dick with a passion. They want to see him ousted. Hell, everyone does. See, 
its a bull market. Wall Street wants monetization in a bull market or nothing at all. They will make their money either way, shorting this feed into oblivion until Costello gives them what they want. Time is his greatest enemy. Yet the street asks for a ""measly"" 5 cents profit. 

Ohh Dick, if they only knew how great your plan actually is over time. For that 5 cents now, would surely cost you $5.00 in the future. A patient pack of wolves awaits. Dick hasn't much time left, unless he can fend them off. Give them something tasty, something to salivate optimism. For hungry wolves will eat quickly, and move on to easy kills, if the kill is sufficient, enough to fill them for the next hunt. If they were truly starving, then they will pick the bone dry. But, they work on volume. They eat well. They aren't here to stay.

Twitter is still a most potent social utility for the masses. Twitter will prevail. The force behind it, is such that, a short seller will want to use it while he feeds on the proceeds from shorting it. This is twitter's underlying strength. Want to know it's greatest potential strength? Not monetizing in infancy. They could then build the most loyal following of the masses unmatched by any other than coca cola.

 One must give THE PEOPLE what they want. One must also give WALLSTREET what it wants. Twitter is here to stay. THE PEOPLE have spoken. To me, this says, there is only one way to play twitter. Buy the bottoms and sell the tops(dare I say 50's). Mid thirties seem bottom-ish to me. I only hope that Dick has figured out a way to have his measly cake and eat it. For then he would surely be a genius. Such is finding the balance. Such is Life.",0

I just went through his entire post history (what he didn't delete) and came to the conclusion that he was not contributing anything constructive to this sub. 

This sub used to be a place where people interested in penny stocks could come and get knowledge and insight without feeling like a total noob. When a user belittles another user and keeps them from posting or asking questions, it goes against the very sprit of the subreddit. I personally enjoy helping new traders and while my techniques are not for everyone, I do my best to guide new traders in a safe and productive direction. What you do with your investing dollars is none of anyone's business and doesn't call for negativity. 

That being said, I struggled with the ban because I feel like /u/badbaseball might be autistic and that is an issue that hits home with me as I have a child with Asperger's Syndrome. I love my kid and when others bash on him, it pisses me off. I try to give him leeway in his actions because his mind is wired differently than mine. However, in this case, I had to make a decision based on the good of the community. 

From this point forward, everyone will be on a short leash. You guys who are regular users of this sub, especially those of you who are experienced traders, need to understand that this sub is here to civilly discuss penny stocks, techniques, technical analysis, and trading platforms. If you disagree with someone else's opinion, do so in a civil manner and have the info to back up your opinion. I think we can all agree that if the sub is used in a positive way, everyone wins. And hopefully makes a little extra coin. 

Good luck trading!

15-07-23,3edic8,How To Detect Washouts Before They Happen,"Hi guys, 

Recently someone PM's me asking ms how I know when a washout will happen 100% of the time. The answer is I don't. HOWEVER, there are certain signals that indicate that a stock will washout. One of the biggest things that will happen this the stock holds under resistance until the market closes. Basically if a stock was holding support all day then broke and held as resistance. Here is an example of this:

http://i.imgur.com/MZOSwMF.png

It bounced a couple of times before eventually breaking, it managed to retest that prior support and failed. Leading to a very nice washout in the morning. You can also use after hours to see if a stock will fade/washout/spike. If the stock begins to put a peak in in the after market, I would keep a close eye on that peak when the market opens. Obviously if it fails to break that peak I will go short!

Hope you guys learned something new! Any questions feel free to ask below!




**Bonus:**

&gt;SLTD- I'd look for failed follow thu momentum to short. Ideally it test 4, fails to break again, and fades.

While the stock closed in the green, my prediction was correct. It showed a lot of weakness in the morning and it appeared to have no way of breaking out. It ended up not breaking 4 and just washed out, like I said. It held under resistance very well.  

**Stocks tend to really drop when:**

* It is breaking a whole/half dollar mark it normally holds

* goes red on the day

* it has been up a lot without much pullback (on the daily chart)

* it breaks past 3:00

* it isn't a crowded trade

* a combination of these things usually makes the drop more rapid/bigger",0

It has seen remarkable growth the past 3 years, but has come under fraud allegations and have dropped it's price nearly 33% since it highs in May. I believe now would be a great time to buy. First let's go over the company.

These are the estimates for the next four quarters for Wall Street. It is also important to note that $VIPS has beaten on every single quarter on both revenue and EPS.

**Revenue Growth**

Q3 | Q4 | Q1 | Q2
---|---|----|----
74% | 70% | 60% | 59%


**Earnings Growth**

Q3| Q4 | Q1 | Q2
---|---|----|----
71% | 50% | 66% | 46%

With such strong growth $VIPS has a P/E of 707. However, when looking at the forward P/E it is 24. For a forward PEG of .52. 

Customer metric are equally encouraging, last Q saw 75% new customers and a 90% increase in orders. Fulfillment (as a percentage of revenue) dropped from 10.6% to 9.4% as distribution centers and scale of economy had a impact.

Their app, which accounts for 70% of sales has also seen positive downloads over the past quarter [Apr - Jun] (http://i.imgur.com/Q4Fjaew.jpg) compared to last quarter [Jan - Mar](http://i.imgur.com/rCxQHFy.jpg)

Aside from fundamentals, I think the [charts](https://www.tradingview.com/x/bcFrWhW4/) look good for $VIPS.  If you look at the volume of July 6th - 9th, all very positive buying days, it has trounced the selling that has been happening the past month. In my mind it means a large player has stepped in and acquired a lot of shares.

I know a Chinese company is not for everyone, and the risk is quite large, but I believe that $VIPS has been beaten down far too low considering the growth potential it holds.",0

You guys gave ALOT of GREAT advice there, and I'm gonna try to condense it once more. My advisor informed me that we should give the trustor power of attorney over the account. I understand this would actually give him a very large amount of control, he could basically act as if it were his own for a short-term.

Let's assume there is some corruption in my family, my lawyers have mentioned today about creating a trust of my own. This seems like a good idea and in the direction of creating and LLC to manage the current trust.

They mentioned making my current trustor of the estates trust, a trustee of my to-be trust. This is all about my own future, but confuses me slightly. I doubt anything is a muck from this or corrupt but I thought it to mention.


What I'm mainly curious of is this: what do I ask, and to who (estate lawyers, wealth managment group, trustor, executor, accountant. . . .  find a new lawyer that specializes in this sort of fraud..?) to find out what I need to know regarding the fee's of the trustor and the trust.

I did sign a document awhile back allowing the trustor to be the trustor, obviously without thinking about fees. So now I'd like to be conscious of it moving forward.

I feel like while I don't have to be secretive about this, I'd rather do it without asking the trustor directly. I just feel that will keep emotions with everyone at there best.

The corruption I am worried of is that he wants me to sell my home to increase the value of the trust that he is trustor of, thus increasing what money he gets.

I am very cynical, but because of the direct and blunt way everything has been forced through under the guise that there the trustor I am a bit annoyed with my lack of transparency.

I am likely just not asking the right questions, and all my confusion, and belief of corruption can be easily cleared up.

But if they really do get some large percent of the trust, which may I add has zero liquid value and is simply the home, I'm not even certain what would happen. Would I be expected to pay him some amount equal to the home? Are there any steps I can take to create total transparency that would allow me to see this coming? Or avoid it entirely?

It seems im avoiding a talk with the trustor that I should have, however we rarely see each other in person and and he refuses any emails etc. Phone calls to a minimum, only in person talks ideally. Which makes everything everyone ever says rather... confused.... As there is never anything in writing",0

For my senior design, I want to do a project that relates to financial programming. For my brainstorming phase, I want to explore some open ended questions that pertain to investments and stocks. 

What are some cool topics/problems I could explore?

Lately, looking at StockTwits, crowdsourcing decisions on selling/buying seems very cool to me. One problem with StockTwits I can see is that the information isn't actionable. And we cannot verify how accurate the sentimency value for each stock is. Does positive sentiment usually determine a bullish pattern for the stock? Or does it have no relevancy at all, and StockTwits is simply a gimmicky echo chamber?

I have been posting on a lot of random trading subreddits lately and found that this one has probably the most boring look. Not only that, but the sticky post is extremely old and the admins are non-existent. I say that the entire sub-reddit gets overhauled. I mean why would you want to ask a question in this subreddit instead of just going to /r/stocks,  or even /r/stockmarket.... The only consistent thing is that bot that posts ""what are you watching tomorrow"" but then offers nothing after that. I know there is not much that can be done but I think the quality of posts is actually insanely low on this subreddit (I have mentioned this multiple times). Maybe by getting people to actually talk about the things they are trading instead of just creating worthless topics.

Here are a few of my ideas:

* Change the subreddits color scheme, as of right now it is IMO dark and bad

* Add flares 

* Make a sticky post dedicated toward newbie questions. (example: Newbie Sunday, ask your newbie questions here!) and have the post go on for one day and make a new one every week

* Auto-remove posts that do not contain context.

* Clean up the subreddit description on the right part of the screen.... make it look a bit more organized...

* 1 month Auto-ban anyone that consistently makes topics about the same ticker 

* make it watchlist friendly, the auto moderator crap on watchlists isn't good IMO

* prevent people from downvoting unless part of the ""community"" (subscribing)

15-07-24,3eh3sj,COP Earnings 7/30,"First and foremost, a disclaimer. I'm new to this. I've managed to build a decent portfolio over the last couple of years with long plays and a few biotech gambles that paid off many-fold, but this will be my first put and I'm still undecided upon the strike price at which I want to open. So please take my DD with a grain of salt, correct me where wrong, point out any learning opportunities, and by all means YOLO to your hearts content.


COP faces earnings on 7/30. Their previous earnings report on April 30th was -$.18 and initiated a sell-off that has not stopped since. RSI is sub-30 which should indicate the stock is oversold, but instead I believe it is an indicator that it is entering a significant and lengthy sell off. RSI hasn't been this low since 2009 and that was prior to their spinning off Phillips 66 and while they were facing the stack-out of &gt;50% of their domestic drilling operations. Another item of interest is that their April earnings report is the first negative earnings they've filed in the last decade. Even in the beginning of '09 following the market crash and the subsequent hard-hit to exploration and drilling ventures they were able to post a $.52 earnings largely due to their downstream operations. They've recently announced that they're suspending deep-water drilling operations and drilling operations in specific North American shales as a cost-cutting measure, which is bad juju for a upstream petroleum company since exploratory drilling is their bread and butter. Combined with the low crude pricing and unexpected crude surplus announced this week I believe they are regretting spinning off their downstream operations as they can no longer rely on downstream revenue to stay afloat during drilling stackouts. Their stock is down %7 in the last week and 16% over the last 30 days. P/E is 17x while the industry as a whole sits at over twice that at 36x. Word on the street is that they are facing ""significant"" workforce reductions in the short-term. I suspect that earnings are going to be extremely dismal and plan to capitalize on the ensuing sell-off and price reduction by placing a few OTM Puts. 


Anyone else interested in COP plays at all? Any indicators I am missing? Please point out any opportunities to improve my DD, I'm all ears.

Let's say you have done your research, picked your stocks (good financials/good intrinsic value). These are the stocks you feel are winners.

Instead of allocating all your cash split between your stocks, instead I have put about 80 percent of my money into the stocks and then have been floating the 20 percent around to whichever stock at the time was about to report their quarterly report. 

So I've been reaping or losing big (mainly reaping), sell that 20 percent floating fund after 1-2 days and then put it into another stock that was about to have their quarterly report.

If these stocks were well chosen and you were going to do well anyway, you would do really well. If you picked clunkers, you would lose more quickly. If you're a gambling person like me, isn't this then a better way to amplify your winnings/losses than to trade on margins (where you have to pay interest on what you're borrowing?)

15-07-24,3edx54,Amazon Stock Price: Killing Me Softly,"Well f**k.  Amazon (AMZN) just announced that they made $92MM last quarter versus a loss of $126MM in the same quarter last year.  So what did investors do?  They decided to reward Amazon with an $85 per share increase after hours.  That’s an additional $40Billion or so in value added.  So now they are officially worth more than Wal-Mart.  And that is beyond stupid…and here is why:

In the last twelve months (TTM – Trailing Twelve Months), Wal-Mart has $485Billion in revenue.  Amazon has $96Billion in the last 12 months.  So Wal-Mart, by sales, is 5 times larger.  But it is worth LESS?!?!?! Ok…maybe it’s about profit…

In the last twelve months, Wal-Mart has made $16Billion in net income.  Amazon has LOST $188MM.  Wait.  So Wal-Mart has MADE A PROFIT of $16Billion and Amazon has LOST $188,000,000….LOST….Oh but wait, everyone says it’s about the growth…

I know.  So Amazon’s BEST argument is that they are investing in more and more things to make the experience for users better and grow their media collection and blah blah blah.  Ok. Fine.  Then why can’t you make money off of $96B EVEN DOING THAT?!?!

Their best margins ever were almost 4%…Wal-Mart, which is brick and mortar and supposed to cost more, is higher on average.  So let’s assume that they hit 4% in profit margin in the long run because of their investments and they finally start to turn a profit…on $96Billion in sales, that’s profit of $3.8Billion. So at a market cap of $265Billion, that’s a price to earnings ratio of 70 still! Which is still 5 times more than historical averages especially for such a mature company because REMEMBER, Amazon is  a MATURE company. It isn’t a start-up! It’s been around for 20 years!

Sure it is! They surprised everyone by growing 20% from last year’s same quarter.  Ok. So let’s assume they continue to grow 20% per year and let’s assume Wal-Mart only grows at 3% per year…how long will it take for Amazon to catch up?  Remember, assuming 20% growth per year is HIGHLY unlikely…is it impossible? No.  But even Amazon’s growth since 2007 has slowed significantly.  From 2007 to 2008, before the big recession, Amazon’s revenue grew 30%.  So there is going to be a slow down.  Have they had better years since then?  Sure, but here is their year over year growth since 2007: 30%, 27.9%, 39.5%, 40.5%, 27%, 21.9%, 19.5%, and this last quarter they SURPRISED everyone with 20% growth.

So back to my point: Let’s assume 20% growth for Amazon every year and only 3% for Wal-Mart every year…In 10 years, Amazon’s revenue will be $595Billion and Wal-Mart’s revenue will be $651Billion! They still haven’t caught up to Wal-Mart! And even at $595Billion in revenue and 4% profit margin, which I remind you they have never achieved, they will have profit of $24Billion which is still only 10 times earnings of TODAY’S MARKET VALUE!…which is about where stocks should sell for during a bad bear market.  So let’s even assume that it should sell for the same multiple as Wal-Mart, which is around 15 or so historically. That’s a valuation of $360Billion which is 35% higher than today.

Soooooo…follow me here…Today’s market value of Amazon is 35% lower than what it should be if it were to grow at 20% per year for 10 more years AND have profit margins it has never seen before.  Does it sound optimistic?  Absolutely.  Yes, Amazon is winning the popularity contest right now, but no companies does that for decades.  Microsoft didn’t. Google didn’t.  Dell didn’t. IBM didn’t.  No one does.  And sometime in there, it will massively correct.  And when it does, it will be ugly.  Until then, my bank account looks ugly.

15-07-24,3edzoi,Don’t leave your financial future to the “experts”,"Some things should never be entrusted to others.

Choosing your home. Raising your kids. Managing your health. You’d never delegate such things to someone else and walk away, no matter how skilled the “expert” is.

By Vita Nelson, Editor, Moneypaper

 FINANCIAL FUTURE

When it comes to the really important things in life, you’ve got to do it yourself. That includes financial planning and investing for your future.

It’s a fact: Placing your finances in the hands of others adds an extra layer of risk to your investments. Here’s why.

First, you have to spend time selecting a professional you trust: a broker, a money manager, or a financial planner.

But how can you be sure you’ve made the right decision? Until it’s too late, you won’t know.

Most brokers and money managers are rewarded for the commissions they generate, not for the quality of their recommendations or the service they give their clients. Bad advice, conflicts of interest, and outright fraud are common.

But let’s assume the best possible outcome: You choose a broker, fund manager or other advisor who is both highly qualified and honest. Even so, your “expert” will never understand your needs or care about them as much as you do.

And you’ll pay that pro 1.5-3% of your money in fees and commissions—sometimes hidden fees you don’t even know you’re paying. Consider: If a fee of only 1% is deducted from a 9% annual return, the time it takes your money to double increases by a year.

No matter how you slice it, a fundamental conflict exists. Your goal is to maximize your investment returns. The professional’s goal is to maximize the fees and commissions he generates from your account.

That may be why brokers and fund managers tend to sell more often than individual investors. Frequent selling generates commissions for the pro—and onerous tax consequences for you. Short-term gains are taxed as ordinary income, not as capital gains. That means as much as 40% or even more of your gains go to taxes.

You can avoid these problems and do better on your own. How? By investing directly in the Dividend Reinvestment Plans (DRIPs) offered by top-rated U.S. companies.

Although a new idea to many people, Direct Investing Plans have actually been around since the 60’s.

That’s when the SEC approved their establishment, for the primary purpose of allowing employees to inexpensively and efficiently purchase stock in the company they worked for. And when some of America’s finest companies opened up DRIPs for their employees, they also made the option to invest directly available to individual investors. But the SEC attached a stipulation:

Companies can offer these plans, but they can’t advertise their existence. So they’ve remained under-the-radar. Wall Street has no financial interest in promoting them because they miss out on transaction fees and commissions when clients invest directly.

I’ve been educating small investors on direct investing since 1981 when I first discovered them. I’ve actually been in the financial industry since 1960 when I made a market in municipal bonds at two Wall Street firms. Since then, my passion has been helping small investors get the same advantages as the big guys on Wall Street.

That’s why I became so enthusiastic about dividend reinvestment plans. These plans make it possible for small investors to enter the market on a level playing field.

By eliminating fees, the small investor can build a diversified portfolio and affordably invest small amounts to build wealth efficiently. With DRIPs, the small investor can benefit from time-tested strategies like dollar-cost averaging—strategies that had previously been reserved for wealthy investors.

Hundreds of thousands of investors prove it every day. Investors like Eileen and Gerard Connolly of Jupiter, Florida. The Wall Street Journal featured their success in a recent article. They started investing directly 15 years ago with the purchase of just 1 share of stock in Kellogg, Coca Cola and Johnson &amp; Johnson. They made small investments when they had a few dollars to put away, and seemingly by miracle, they now have accounts worth more than $64,000.

Lynn Shaner of Katy, Texas summed it up this way, “Purchase good quality dividend-paying stocks on a regular periodic schedule and reinvest the dividends. This is the single best investment advice I have come across in 30+ years of researching investment strategies.”

Your financial security is too important to leave to the “experts”. Surprisingly, it can actually take less of your time to handle your own investments. You owe it to yourself to take a few moments and find out more. Check out the research at www.drp.com today.

15-07-24,3ee24s,Buying stocks near 52 week lows.,"For the past few years, I've pursued a mostly short-term strategy for my portfolio: Buy shares in companies that are hovering near 52 week lows with regards to their share price. Collect the dividends in the meanwhile, and exit from the stock once they exceeded a certain percentage of their original 52 week high. 

For example, in late 2012, I bought shares in Intel at approximately $21 a share, reasoning that Intel was just in a middle of a cyclical slump and that the share price would rebound eventually. The stock bottomed out at $19 by Christmas and eventually rebounded as Intel reported better earnings in 2013 and 2014. 

I sold a portion of these shares in late 2014, at around $35 a share, pocketing a very handsome gain. 

I've performed this strategy with a number of other companies and it has worked out for the most part, with an average time horizon of two to three years. 

Now, I am rarely ever perfect with regards to calling the low and high (Intel might have been the only company where my personal call on the bottom and the top was right with where the company actually ended up), but still, I've recorded handsome gains on other such companies that I've played this strategy with as well, even if I didn't necessarily buy at the very bottom and sell at the very top. 

I understand that my strategy is not necessarily tax efficient (but my tax bracket is pretty low, so that it doesn't bother me too much), and nor is it the most scientific, but in my five years of watching the market every single day, many companies are cyclical with regards to revenue and earnings. Some years are always better than others.

When researching companies that are hovering near their 52 week lows, I focus on a number of things:

1. Their net profit margins are positive. 
2. They generate positive operating cash flow.
3. Current ratio is over 1.0. 
4. Long term debt over equity is less than 0.5. 
5. They pay a dividend.

After that, I focus on the stability of the business and whether or not I think the company has a good economic moat. I read about what the company does and what they sell. For example, Intel is the only supplier of x86 chips (yes, AMD is a competitor, but Intel is crushing them). PCs are a declining business, and servers are not demonstrating as much growth as they used to, but these businesses are cyclical. Eventually people will replace their PCs, Intel's earnings will improve momentarily, and the stock price will go up for a period. 

For right now, I'm liking Qualcomm and Intel. ",19

I hope you’re having a wonderful July.  So this e-mail is going to be an important one.  The reason is some of the wealthiest people in the world are starting to send some very bearish signals in the markets. 

Ray Dalio (Net Worth 15 Billion) – “There are now no safe places to invest.” On 23 July 2015”.

Carl Icahn (Net Worth 23 Billion)  - “I believe the Market is extremely overheated – Especially high yield bonds.  If more respected investors had warned about the market in 2007, we might have avoided the crisis in 2008.” On 19 June 2015

Warren Buffett (Net Worth 72 Billion) – his company has made 20.2 billion in profit over the last 4 quarters and his cash position during that period of time has increased by 14.8 billion.  This means he has retained 75% of his new earnings over the past year in cash.  In May 2015, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, and Charlie Munger talked about their concern with the FED’s continual manipulation of low interest rates and the potential bubble in real estate prices.  The video can be found [here](http://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=A2.DT&amp;m=3k.SsslVl7zCZOB&amp;b=HxC_9DSZlaabYWpMlgISJg). 

So I think you get my point.  Lots of people think the market is getting a little scary and some are speaking with their actions.  So what’s the bubble?  Well, Carl Icahn and Ray Dalio think the junk bond market is the potential bubble.  The implications and how that might play out in stocks and other markets is unknown, but threatening.  Below my signature block, I’ve pasted a thorough analysis of Icahn’s concerns.  It was written by my friend Matt.  He was kind enough to send this analysis to me for the group's reading pleasure. 

Finally, here’s a really great [article](http://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=A2.DT&amp;m=3k.SsslVl7zCZOB&amp;b=CrzOU_bzuknZOjqywMFaXw) that demonstrates the extreme valuation metrics we are currently facing.  I highly recommend you take the time to read this article from Ph.D. John Hussman. 
Also I think it’s important to point out the unprecedented amount of margin debt that’s being used by wall street presently.  Feel free to check out this chart by [Doug Short](http://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=A2.DT&amp;m=3k.SsslVl7zCZOB&amp;b=lKT.JSEdoTZm8b1d_4.v1A) to see what I’m referring to. 
If you are interested in tracking my conversation with Stig and other smart investors in the community, you can go to this point in our [forum](http://clicks.aweber.com/y/ct/?l=A2.DT&amp;m=3k.SsslVl7zCZOB&amp;b=RaNdgcFT71uahvHoJovr.Q).  (P.s. We've fixed the technical issues we were previously having thanks to our good friend James Meirowsky!)

As we’ve said many times in the past, there’s no way of predicted the short term movements in the market.  With that said, we are getting to a point were major players with large capital are starting to buckle down their hatches.  I’ll leave you with Warren Buffett’s best investing advice: Rule #1: Don’t lose money.  Rule #2: refer back to rule #1.
 
Cheers,
Preston

15-07-24,3ehppn,"Robert Shiller: The Housing Market Still Isn't Rational","""Home prices have been climbing. They have risen 27 percent nationally since 2012, even more in places like San Francisco. But why worry? If you accept the efficient markets theory — and believe that real estate is an efficient market — then these prices are based on “new information,” even if you don’t know what that information is.

The problem with this kind of thinking is that the efficient markets theory is at best a half-truth, as a voluminous literature on market anomalies shows. What’s more, even that half-truth is grounded mainly in the stock market, which attracts professional investors who sometimes do make the market behave efficiently.



The housing market is another matter. It is far less rational than even the often irrational stock market, for a couple of important reasons. First, most investors find it difficult to understand how housing supply responds to changes in demand. Only a small minority of people think carefully about such things. Second, it is very hard for the minority of smart-money investors who do understand such matters to bet against bubble-level prices in real estate markets. In housing, the smart money has relatively little voice.


For the first point, in “A Nation of Gamblers: Real Estate Speculation and American History,” a presentation at the 2013 American Economic Association convention, Edward L. Glaeser of Harvard University reviewed real estate booms and busts. He showed how real estate investors have repeatedly made the mistake of neglecting the supply response to rising prices. In the Alabama cotton farmland boom of 1815 to 1819, for example, high cotton prices seemed to justify high prices for cotton land. What most investors failed to see at the time was that these cotton prices would induce new farmers around the world to begin to grow cotton. That same failure to anticipate how supply can respond to demand applies to many forms of real estate today. Developers and builders will, one way or another, exploit overpricing, increasing effective supply, in that way bringing real estate prices down.

For the second point, in 1977 Edward M. Miller pointed out in The Journal of Finance something that should have been obvious: Efficient markets require the possibility of selling short. In the stock market, for example, with short-selling, people who think the market is overpriced and headed for a fall can borrow shares and sell the borrowed shares at the current high price. If share prices do indeed fall, they can buy the shares back at a lower price and repay the loan, with a profit.

Short-selling helps prevent bubbles from forming, but such negative bets cannot easily occur in the housing market. You can’t routinely borrow a house and sell it, promising to buy back the same house later to repay the loan.

Markets without the possibility of making these negative bets will be inefficient. That’s because if it is not possible to short, the smart money can do no more than avoid holding an overpriced asset. Canny traders are forced to sit on the sidelines, and watch in futility as prices decline as they expected. Without short-sellers, there is nothing to stop a group of ignorant investors — who get some ill-conceived idea that a certain investment is just terrific — from bidding up prices to extravagant levels. In the housing market, that poses an enormous problem.

Suppose that you are convinced housing prices are too high. How can you profit from this insight? You might consider shorting the residential real estate investment trusts (REITs) that invest in residential properties and are themselves traded on stock exchanges. However, REIT prices do not have a consistent correlation with housing prices, and tend to resemble stock prices instead. For example, the housing market declined in the two years after the March 2009 bottom of the stock market. The S &amp; P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index fell 6 percent over this period. But, over that same time interval, the S &amp; P 500 Residential REIT index tripled in value. Clearly, shorting this index would have been a bad move, even though a bet that housing prices would decline was spot on.

During the financial crisis, some professional investors did manage to profit by correctly forecasting home price declines. They used mortgage derivatives such as collateralized debt obligations to place their bets. John Paulson of Paulson &amp; Company is well known for very successfully profiting from his prediction of trouble in the housing market. But mortgages are not homes, and he and others like him did not beat down the emerging housing bubble before it grew out of proportion.

In 2006, in collaboration with several colleagues and me, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange set up a futures market for single-family homes in 10 United States cities. This market is still going today, but it is not very active and it can be used to place only a small bet that home prices will fall.

Still, despite rising prices, at present, exuberant investors do not dominate the domestic housing market over all. The Pulsenomics survey of household heads in January showed that national home price expectations are modest: on average increases of only 3.7 percent a year are expected for the next 10 years.

Extravagant expectations do lurk in parts of the market. In the 2015 Yale School of Management survey of recent home buyers that Karl Case of Wellesley College, Anne Thompson of Dodge Data and Analytics and I direct, our preliminary results confirmed the overall Pulsenomics conclusion yet found that some people have strikingly unrealistic expectations.

In San Francisco, for example, we found that while the median expectation for annual home price increases over the next 10 years was only 5 percent, a quarter of the respondents said they thought prices would increase each year by 10 percent or more. That would mean a net 150 percent increase in a decade. These people are apparently not thinking about the supply response that so big a price increase would generate. People like this could bid prices in some places so high that eventually the local market will collapse. Yet the smart money can’t find a profitable way to correct such errors today.

The bottom line is that there is no reason to assume that the real estate market is even close to efficient. You may want to buy a house if you love it and can afford it. But remember that you cannot safely rely on “comparable sales” to judge that the price is fair. The market isn’t efficient enough for that.""

15-07-25,3eki8z,Thoughts on UltraFlix/$NTEK?,"Doing my DD on $NTEK this weekend. Basically I've been shopping for new TVs and keep seeing UltraFlix everywhere. Started looking into it and it seems like they've got some pretty decent licenses. Not sure about image quality yet, but supposedly they've got some pretty rad compression that lets you stream 4k under 10mbps. 

To me this seems like they may have value as a buyout based on some of their library and manufacturer agreements (coming preinstalled on some 4k smart TVs). Not sure that they'll ever have major market domination but they are definitely ahead of the 4k curve. However nanotech entertainment and UltraFlix websites both suck and that always makes me not trust a company ha. 

i expect after this holiday season to see a lot more 4k televisions in homes. And while it's great for the 4k market that we'll have a 4k bluray and comcast should have their 4k TV service up and running, I would think both of those factors may actually hurt UltraFlix. OR if 4k bluray are cost prohibitive and comcast is still trying to rape customers, I could see this as being something consumers give a go. Especially if they have it installed on their TV already. 


Anyone in on this stock already? It's current price definitely seems a little low. Might be worth throwing 1k and letting it ride. ",2

15-07-24,3effyz,Contrarian Investing can be Used for Different Time Frames,"Contrarian investing is all about extremes. When the market moves to one extreme, it will bounce back the other way. But the important question is, what is “extreme”? Extreme is a relative term, depending on your time frame. A 10% decline in one day is considered extreme, whereas a 10% decline in one month is considered normal.

Thus, there are different levels of extreme, which means that contrarian investing can be used for different time frames. A contrarian investment can have a time frame of a few days, a few weeks, a few months, or even a few years.

Multi-Year Contrarian Investing
Multi-year contrarian investing is similar to secular investing in that you’re playing the cyclical trends that each last 3-5 years. This is known as catching the falling knife, which back in my post on Secular Investing I advised against. I only advised against catching the falling knife because we didn’t talk about the tools need to catch the market bottom or peak.

Contrarian Investing Oscillators and time / magnitude extremes do this for us – they tell us when a multi-year market trend is highly oversold or overbought. Oscillators can be adjusted based on the time frame of your investment. RSI is based on the “close price”. But that close price can be adjusted. Is it the weekly close price (price as of 4pm Friday) or is it the daily close price (price as of 4 pm Monday to Friday). For multi-year contrarian investing, use the weekly close (some people even use the monthly close – the close on the last day of each month) for RSI. That’s because a shorter term RSI (e.g. daily) should not be used for making longer term investment decisions – doing so just doesn’t make sense!

Keep in mind that multi-year contrarian investing won’t allow you to be very precise with the multi-year peak or bottom. For example, RSI and magnitude / time extremes sent SELL signals in January 2007, a full half year before the market did peak. Had you gone short in January 2007, you would have experienced a half year of pain. But that’s the price longer term investors have to pay.

Similarly, RSI and magnitude / time extremes sent BUY signals in December 2008. That’s 35% away from the market bottom!

But although you can’t catch the exact bottom or top, you can get very close.

Multi-Month Contrarian Investing
Multi-month contrarian investing involves playing the monthly market waves. Investments typically last from a few months (ie 2 months) to less than a year (ie 10 months).

When a market has gone in one direction nonstop for several months, RSI and time / magnitude extremes should send signals to invest the other way. In terms of these kinds of medium term investments, it’s best to use daily close as a price input for your RSI.

Short Term Contrarian Investing
Short term contrarian investing isn’t that popular. I don’t know why, but I’ve tested this time frame out before (investments are more like trades – they last just a few days to max. a few weeks). For some reason, RSI doesn’t work very well on these shorter term frames. Maybe because there’s just too much “noise” (false price action) in the short term that renders contrarian investing useless.

All in all, I prefer using contrarian investment tactics for multi-month time frames. Long term contrarian investing means that the price you enter your investment in may be far off from the ultimate peak or bottom.

A Caveat – The Problem with RSI

RSI sometimes doesn’t work very well. Here’s an example:

Let’s assume that the market was falling, and RSI fell to 20. Thus, a BUY signal was generated. However, RSI can back off from Oversold levels merely by the price not falling. That means, if the price doesn’t rally but it stays flat, the Oversold sign is negated. Thus, your long bullish position means nothing.
The opposite is also true.",1

Each quarter they add at least 10BN to their cash hoard, so it's investments are slowly but surely becoming a more prominent earner for them. In 20 years I think it'll amount to a big part of their quarterly earnings no?

15-07-25,3ekmhc,Compound interest question with target index fund,"This may be a simple question, but after reading the FAQ's and searching online, I've yet to find an answer. Perhaps I'm just not asking/searching for it correctly.

I understand in principle how compound interest works. However, I'm not too sure of how this is applied to stocks (in this case, a vanguard target index fund).

How does this work? Is some type of interest generated at the end of the year based on how the index fund has performed that year? Then that interest is somehow reinvested into buying more of that fund? Is this automatically done? Do I have to just keep contributing money and this will automatically be done? Is the compound value based on the amount of shares you own throughout the life of the target fund?

I guess I'm just looking for a simple ELI5 explanation as to how compound interest works in regards to index funds.

15-07-25,3ekqs4,Good Companies That Are Overpriced,"My recent post about Amazon being overpriced was met with heavy criticism.  Everyone kept telling me how Amazon was not overpriced because of how great their business model is and how fast they are growing. 

This is exactly what is wrong with investing.  Everyone thinks that just because a company is popular or their products are popular, the stock price is irrelevant.  Exactly wrong.  Should you pay more for a company that is growing faster? I would agree.  But in the world of Amazon, no one cares what the price is because the stock keeps going up.  Who cares that it's selling for more than Wal-Mart even though Wal-Mart is five times larger in terms of sales and makes $16Billion per year vs losing money?  Well, I care. 

So what I have decided to do is go through a list of S&amp;P 500 companies that I think are GREAT companies but are selling for more than they should and show that they aren't selling for bubble-like levels. These are very popular and market dominating companies.  They are still priced a bit more than I would like, but they have strong balance sheets and good cash flow.  This is NOT a buy or sell recommendation for any of these.  I am not allowed to give advice like that. I am merely stating that these companies are solid financially.

They are big brands and have more cash on hand than total liabilities, so they can pay off ALL their debts with the stroke of a check, they have had 3 year net income growth in excess of 25% per year, and their Price to Earnings ratio is in excess of 40.

Facebook (FB): Has anyone heard of this company.  They have over 1.2 Billion active users and generate revenues $13 Billion per year.  They are generating a lot of cash and putting it in their coffers and their stock has gone from a low of $18 per share to $97 per share as of Friday.  They are selling for over 94 times earnings! So a company that already has 1 in 6 people in the world on it, and they are selling for 94 times earnings.  Ok.  Is there upside? I am sure there is.  Only two years ago they had $5 Billion in revenue, but this is a solid company that will likely sell at a better valuation in the future.  I will hold tight for a better opportunity.  

Under Armour (UA): Hot new sports apparel business that has Jordan Spieth and Kevin Durant as endorsement contracts.  They have generated 29% growth in earnings over the past 3 years and they have plenty of money in the bank to pay off their low debts, relative to cash.  But of course, what new hot item wouldn't be without an overpriced valuation. They have bad Free Cash Flow but it's not awful.  

Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG): Who doesn't love Chipotle?  Losers don't like Chipotle. Fits all the metrics we want and, of course, because of its popularity, it is selling for bad valuations.  

So, like I tell everyone, good companies and good ideas can have, and usually do have, bad valuations especially during the good times that we have now.  

Just be patient.  There are bull and bear markets...we are in the midst of a very solid bull market, but it will end...and when it does, the most overpriced stocks get hit the hardest.

so i think they are under-valued right now , under 50$
but unclear how they are going to fix canibalization and make their brand stronger,they might do something with fashion and internet of things for growth




about $KATE , awesome growth , great young designs , but think they are at fair value , even after current price drops, but might surprise in current earnings, i think kors has stronger brand name , and high net profits, what worries me at kate is their debt , but they probably use it for high growth to open new stores

15-07-25,3el55c,Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) question,"Hello! First post here.

I recently got my first job with an employee-owned firm using an ESOP (in addition to a 401k plan) for their retirement benefits.

The ESOP is only evaluated annually, at which time your contributions throughout the year are used to purchase shares. In the mean time, you have the option to put the contributions in Schwab's capital preservation fund (SWBXX) or Oakmark Equity I (OAKBX). 

My question for you is: Which of these is the best choice considering the contributions are only in the account for a max of 1 year until they are used to purchase company shares? I feel like the OAKBX has a slightly higher risk and has been trending down lately, and so there is a slightly higher chance that my yearly contributions are actually less come evaluation time. On the other hand, the SWBXX is meant to grow at basically a savings account rate. On the off chance that there are no shares available for purchase at evaluation time, the money could spend another year in the account with no growth (I am unsure if it is common at all to not be able to purchase shares at evaluation...).

I appreciate your advice! Thanks!",1

15-07-25,3el98g,Prediction: Facebook stock will double/triple in value in the next 12-18 months because of election season.,"It is my belief that Facebook's stock is extremely cheap right now, based on what will inevitably be a huge year to come in advertising earnings.

You see, as a small business owner, I know how valuable Facebook advertising has been over the past year or two.  And with election season kicking off, we will see politicians, both local and nationally, dumping massive amounts of money into social media campaigns.  

Facebook's earnings will go through the roof.  Because not only will more ad space be purchased, but it will also send the CPC skyrocketing.

15-07-24,3efw2y,Investing in Real Estate is So Stressful… Perception vs. Reality,"“Oh my gosh, your life must be so stressful. Dealing with collecting rent, evicting tenants, doing repairs, showing apartments. You must never get a break!”. These are some of the most common reactions I get from people when I mention that I invest in real estate.

Now let’s discuss how “stressful” it really is.

I’ve been investing in real estate since 2010, a total of ~60 months. During this period I’ve had to evict two tenants, one which left amicably and the other which took a 2 month process to evict. I’ve also performed mostly routine repairs every couple of months. The one non-routine emergency repair that I’ve experienced was a unit that experienced frozen pipes two winters in a row and required a few dozen hours to fix properly. Oh and I’ve also had to purchase a spray foam insulation kit and spray the basement walls in one of my units which had excessively cold floors above during the winter months.


The remainder of the tasks have been largely routine and since 2012, outsourced to a property management firm. These routine tasks include advertising vacancies, performing tenant checks, preparing leases and collecting rents. These tasks average a few hours each month per unit.

As you can see, I have indeed been stressed a few times as a result of investing in real estate. But in no way have I been stressed nearly as much as anyone would initially fear. I have had to deal with two evictions, a handful of repairs and routine tasks that take a few hours each week.

Had I not invested in real estate I would have spared myself these few stressful situations as well as a few hours of work each week. But then what would be the real cost of doing that? I would have given up being able to retire nearly 25 years earlier than most people can ever dream of. You see, my portfolio conservatively increases my net worth by $280,000 each year as a result of appreciation, mortgage paydown and cashflow. For every five years I hold onto the real estate I can retire at least fifteen years earlier (and that’s accounting for capital gains taxation and inflation)!

Let’s see, I can invest in real estate and retire 25 years earlier or, alternately, I can spare myself a few additional hours of work each week and then subsequently go to work each and every day for an additional 25 years; only retiring when I’m 65 years old (or older). Which one is the real cost?",15
15-07-25,3elbu7,Options. Hedging positions approaching earnings,"Classic question I'm guessing. 

so here's my thing. I have long positions only. Lots of em. About 10 to 20 face earnings each month. I don't want to play the earnings day casino, so I want to hedge volatility with options. 

So I go back last 4 earnings days for a given contract to get an idea avg single-day movement. And then I buy a put using an options calculator that would make me break even on a down move (and on an up move for that matter). 

Obviously the problem approaching earnings is premiums get higher daily. I don't have permission to sell naked, so I can't immune positions from IV deflation. 

My question is: When is an OK and/or optimal time to buy a put against my long position?

THANKS 

And because I care about money more than internet attempts to label me stupid, I'll call myself a bumbling fool. Rather than insult, please tell me in detail a much better way, and even everything I'm doing wrong would be excellent. I'll love you for it (hell, I love you anyway friends). ",5

I'm 20 years old reaping the benefits of the new technologies such as Robinhood and Wealthfront that make investing more simple than it previously was.

Around 10k of this loan is specifically used for rent where I have to pay 1k each month on the first. Do you guys think it's a good idea to throw this 10k into Wealthfront once it is dispersed and withdraw every month when I have to pay rent?

- Purchase offer (including all counter offers), dated, signed and accepted
- Proof of down payment
- Updated and signed net worth statements of all co-owners / primary shareholders if purchased through a company
- Tax reports &amp; appendices on income and expenses of each rental property
- If purchased through a company, financial statements of the company for the last 3 fiscal years
- Detailed income list for all rental properties you own
- Current copies of all current leases (along with documentation supporting rental increases that have happened over the years for longer-term tenants)
- Detailed mortgage financial statements for all properties
- Detailed financial statements of all investments held (stock, real estate, etc.)

The SEC announced today that three former Oppenheimer employees have agreed to settle charges stemming from the unregistered sale of billions of shares of penny stocks on behalf of a customer. Today’s actions were instituted against Scott A. Eisler, a former registered representative at Oppenheimer’s branch in Boca Raton, Fla., his former branch manager and supervisor Arthur W. Lewis, and Lewis’s supervisor Robert Okin, a former head of Oppenheimer’s Private Client Division.

According to the SEC’s orders instituting settled administrative proceedings, on behalf of the Oppenheimer customer, Eisler executed billions of penny stock shares in illegal unregistered distributions with Lewis participating in and in some cases approving the sales. Although securities laws provide an exemption from liability for brokers who engage in a reasonable inquiry into the facts surrounding a customer’s proposed sale, the SEC’s orders find that Eisler and Lewis failed to make the requisite inquiry despite substantial red flags associated with the sales.

“In the face of red flags that their customer’s stock sales were not exempt from registration, Oppenheimer’s branch personnel allowed these unregistered transactions to occur,” said Andrew J. Ceresney, Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “Okin, one of Oppenheimer’s senior-most executives, also failed to properly supervise by allowing these transactions to occur and failing to respond appropriately to the red flags suggesting violations of the federal securities laws.”

Eisler agreed to pay a $50,000 penalty and be barred from engaging in penny stock sales or working in the securities industry for at least one year. Lewis agreed to pay a $50,000 penalty and be barred from working in a supervisory capacity in the securities industry for at least one year. Okin agreed to pay a $125,000 penalty and be barred from working in a supervisory capacity in the securities industry for at least one year. They each agreed to the settlements without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings.",1

15-07-24,3eg5r4,Looking for some input on CDOM,"I don't normally consider penny stocks for investments, but this one caught my eye based off who was doing the [insider buying.](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/cdom/insider-trades)

Philip Frost is a self made billionaire doctor with decades of experience. He started 2 companies, one of which was sold to Teva. The other one I invested in based off his insider buying and have nearly doubled my investment in less than a year. He also has made other large investments where he was an insider and has done well.

I see that he recently bought CDOM and has bought some steadily with ownership of 34MM+ shares. 

What I don't understand is what this company does exactly or if there are any growth prospects for it. According to Google Finance:

*Tiger X Medical, Inc. (Tiger X), formerly Cardo Medical, Inc., is engaged in collecting and managing royalty income. The Company previously operated as an orthopedic medical device company engaged in designing, developing and marketing reconstructive joint devices and spinal surgical devices. After the sale of all of the assets in its Spine Division, the Company's continuing operations include the collection and management of its royalty income earned in connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement with Arthrex, Inc. (Arthrex). The Company continues to advance and promote its former knee product lines through participation in mobile teaching labs, seminars and live surgery. As of December 31, 2014, the Company's royalty income amounted to $427,000. The Company has five issued patents related to intervertebral stabilizers that were not sold as part of the sale of all of the Reconstructive Division assets and the Spine Division assets.*

They don't have a dividend that I can see so I don't know how that income flows back to shareholders given the relatively stable price of the stock.

Is this worth while to invest in? Are there any growth prospects?",3

I am 19 and am going to college. I paid the first year by myself and stick to my budget quite strictly. I will almost certainly need to take loans out eventually, but they should be interest free. My parents may help me with college and I have scholarship opportunities.  I already have an emergency fund and a relatively extensive social fund (about 3.5k). I will have very little income from August until May. I will tutor and maybe get one large check. My budget of 25$ a week worked last year and should work this year as well. 

Goals: I would like to be able to graduate (3 years from now) and be able to pull this money out and slash all the student loans I may have. I am also open to investing for the much longer term. 

I see a lot of potential in the electrification of transportation (I know a ton about this subject, I am being paid to write about it) and I would like to invest in that sector. I also see renewable energy infrastructure being lucrative and am fairly knowledgeable about that subject as well.  

Future expenses: I have a decent car and an emergency fund to if there is a major repair. The only other expenses I have are the typical college expenses: books, spring break, parties etc.

With my current understanding of investment I would pay off as much as my student bills as possible, but keep enough for an emergency fund and take out loans. I believe their is potential to optimize the money I have earned the past couple of summers and have been reading up on personal finance and investing literature. All advice would be appreciated!",0

On July 20th your hapless hero was browsing around growth stocks on ToS for an opportunity to benefit from the ridiculously high implied volatility these stocks tend to have around earnings releases. Eventually, the specific asset was found with the same earnest mindset King Arthur felt when he located the Holy Grail. 

Using the mystic powers of ToS your hero found something almost as rare as a peacock with Leucism. A $4.30 540 call option expiring in four days with a ITM probability of 10%

*$4.30*  
**10% chance to expire ITM**  

As the greenbacks appeared in your hero's eyes, your hero found a matching put for $3.01 to maintain delta neutrality.  

Then everything changed when Thursday arrived.   

A regular trading day like any other. My short /es position making good money. Everything was solid with Yacht daydreams dancing in the mind's eye.

Then AMZN released better than expected earnings. Absolutely ridiculously better than expected. Shit went to mother fucking $570 in AH. Not gonna lie, seeing that P/L of **($30,000)** made me question my life decisions. Later that night I ended up drowning my woes at the local water hole.

Woke up at 11:00 am PST as I took the day off from work, dreading to look at the market today. But hey, didn't matter got laid. What's another $30,000 with pick up lines like ""hey bby, I'm a derivatives trader.""

I asked about short term investing over the next 4-8 years. She suggested a mutual fund with a good (3-5 stars) rating on morningstar.com, is a growth fund with good performance, and with low fees/dues.

I am a student about to be a sophomore in a 5 yr program for an engineering degree from a tech institute in the US. I will be working part time and expect to be able to put 50-60 dollars a week into this investment. During the summer with more time this number would rise to about 100.

 My projected student loans are expected to be about 20k at graduation. My goal is to pay off at least half of my loans with this investment.

I figured it was cheap because of being so close to a rough area. This area is basically a one door foyer in the block leading to apartments. It has a terrible reputation. 

The police have a car stationed permanently outside. 
The building was on fire last month.  
I see guys walking out looking beaten up. 
I see women walking out with the crack nervous chew. 
Caught a guy leaning on my car who I think was trying to break in. 
Loads of illegals migrants too  but these guys are alright, just a different culture. 

When I arrived it turns out the apartment is actually INSIDE the same building. I thought it was just close from the description. The vendor had taken a friend with her and they asked me to go inside. They saw the look of fear on my face and I can't see the realisation of 'oh not again'.
It was kinda funny... 

 I think they are hoping to get someone who has no clue.  

The apartment is less than half the value of apartments in the next block. 

When I realised it's actually inside the crazy place I realised 'no,  this is too much even for me' I can't buy somewhere and be afraid to even enter.

**However** if you either want better formatting or would rather program it than work slowly with excel, here's the solution.

#[The GitHub Repository for yFinanceData](https://github.com/brockwhittaker/yFinanceData)

Basically you install the PHP script server-side to fetch the results. The entire code is [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brockwhittaker/yFinanceData/master/php/getTickers.php).

You then run a client-side script using JavaScript [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brockwhittaker/yFinanceData/master/js/recieveData.js) that processes and refines the data into a more readable and usable form.

Then all you have to do is send a request via AJAX to the PHP to get the data with the tickers, startdate, and enddate as parameters. Information on that is in the GitHub Readme.

If you guys want to test out the data fetching, a full working version is here:

#[Demo](http://www.lavancier.com/yFinance/test.html).

---

And for anyone who has a website already up and running that supports PHP (probably does), if you want to use this in about 5 minutes, download the zip of the repository, unzip it, and put all the files right on to your webserver in a path called /yFinanceData/. Then go to www.yoursite.com/yFinanceData/test.html, and your test page should look and work exactly like mine.

I'm ready to invest $3000-$5000 right now and I am financially secure. I have an emergency fund and a guaranteed job for the next 5 years. I'll divide my income up so that roughly %20-%40 will be put into this while the rest will pay for bills and savings.

Regardless, what are the best performers (and relatively safe) for Vanguard ETFs?

I did read the FAQ, but I didn't see anything about which ones to buy. I even searched this subreddit and couldn't find many of the ETFs that people mentioned.

Thank you in advance!",4

15-07-25,3ek60a,"Looking for advice on a potential ""investment opportunity"" on Panama Canal","My dad has been looking for a place to move his $10,000 invested in high yield bonds. It's clearly not working out, and we're giving more to the advisor than we are making.

My dad just finished telling me he's interested in putting all $10,000 into an investment opportunity involving the Panama Canal expansion. Basically, they are planning on expanding the Panama Canal to allow for super-tankers to go through. Just off the coast, they are planning on building a refueling station for these super-tankers. The station will take up an entire island, supposedly, and there's potential for a lot of money to be made. He would be investing in the construction of this refueling island.

Now, my dad has a friend who has already invested $10,000 into this. The people involved with the investment flew him to Panama, where he sat in on an investor's meeting. Apparently, there were government officials from Panama sitting in on this and it all seemed very legit.

I can't help but feel like this just won't work out. It seems to me like one of those too good to be true opportunities. It may not necessarily be a scam, but I definitely have my doubts. I'm not experienced at all when it comes to big investments like this, but is it normal to be flown out to the country in question for an ""investor's meeting""? It sounds to me like they just bought a ticket with some of his $10,000 investment to make the scam seem more legit. Government officials? Guys dressed up in suits. I'm hoping someone can shed some light on this. This $10,000 could be better put towards some immediate debt, in my opinion. My dad maintains the ""you can't win if you don't play"" mentality.

Edit: I think this coastal refuelling station will be a private enterprise. I don't think it has anything to do with the government. That being said, it seems all the more likely to fail in my eyes. Thank you everyone for your advice!",6

15-07-25,3ek9qq,Conversion of Traditional IRA to Roth IRA - Tax Question,"I'm going to convert my traditional IRA account to a Roth IRA account and have a few tax questions that hopefully the brilliant minds here at Reddit can help with. The multiple websites I researched all seem to give different and conflicting answers.

I recently rolled (to keep numbers simple) 75k into a traditional IRA from a 457 deffered comp. 50k was contributed by me over the years and it earned 25k. To convert to a Roth, am I only required to pay taxes on the 50k, calculated as regular income at whichever tax bracket it moves me into OR do I now pay taxes on the entire 75k? Secondly, can the taxes be  paid over two years, say 25k now and 25k next year. One article I read stated that was possible around 2010/2011? Tax rules change all the time... I can't keep up. Last question, do most investment firms allow a direct conversion from IRA to Roth IRA or do you need to open a new account and move money over... I'm asking because I'd prefer not to lose my current positions. 

Thanks for the advice. - I'm fully aware I should still talk to a certified tax nerd for tax answers.",6

15-07-25,3ekdvw,Shorting copper juniors that are going to zero? (Otto Rock blogpost),"This guy tends to have a pretty accurate understanding of mining:

http://incakolanews.blogspot.ca/2015/07/vales-second-quarter-iron-ore.html
&gt; 
&gt; What you're seeing in the iron ore space is what you're about to see in the copper production sector:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) A metal controlled by a handful of massive world producers
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Prices for the metal drop
&gt; 
&gt; 3) The big producers react by producing more
&gt; 
&gt; 4) Prices drop further
&gt; 
&gt; 5) The big producers remain profitable, but smaller and medium sized companies are squeezed to death
&gt; 
&gt; 6) Exploration stage companies are killed by the price drop.
&gt; 
&gt; 7) Big producers don't care, they're still above cost of production, they keep churning out the production and are rewarded by share price growth on the news of better numbers.
&gt; 
&gt; Copper still has a way to drop, people. Get used to the idea.


So my question is: would shorting a basket of copper juniors be a decent strategy?

A few negatives I can think of:  

* The big move dollar wise in copper is already behind us (but still, shorting something that goes to 0 = 100% return right?  I assume if you're short a stock that goes to 0 means you get paid out 100%, or is that not correct?)  
* Maybe not possible to short junior coppers  
* The better of the beaten up companies could get bought out for big % premiums  
* The price trend of base metals bottoms or even reverses

15-07-27,3epydz,"A day trading strategy for noobies that has worked for me, and can keep you in the yolo game longer.","So it's pretty much guaranteed newbies will lose money day trading (or any kind of trading).   Let's also hope you haven't quit your day job so that you aren't depending on your day trading profits to live.  (I work from home so I day trade and work at the same time).

So assuming you start with $27,000 in your account, 25k of that being necessary for trading on margin so you can trade as many times as you want without waiting for money to clear.  You have the additional 2k as a buffer so that you don't get margin calls, and let's face it, you expect to lose money, but you don't expect to lose more than a $200-1000 before you start seriously reevaluating your plan.

So let's say you gain and lose money over the course of a few months but basically you're down 1k (26,000 total in your account).  What do you do?  Well I started day trading stocks like disney and WFC that are ""safe"" and always generally going up up up.  If you buy on those dips, and sell on the highs all in the same day, you can make 60-300 dollars a day depending on how much you leverage.  Also if you fuck up and buy at the wrong time and the stock starts going down, just sit on it for a few more hours, or a day or two tops and the stock will be back up again.  Then you can sell at a profit, or sell to break even so that you have the funds to buy on the next low again.  You can do this until you build up the 1k that you originally lost, and then start experimenting with higher risk YOLO stocks again, or hell maybe just keep day trading like this?  

Anyways, this is working for me, and I was wondering if anyone else does this, has an opinion on why this might be a stupid idea, or has an even better plan to stay in the game instead of burning through an entire account trying to win back losses the same way you lost them in the first place.  ",7

What does this mean? Investors simply do not care how well the companies are run. The slowing Chinese economic growth issue is one that apparently cannot be ignored. 


What next: QRVO reports earnings this coming week(the 29th) and AVGO reports August 6th. These next two weeks are incredibly crucial for the industry in my view. Any negativity will send all of these names plunging(even the slightest ""bad"" news like Apple's earnings have already done that)

15-07-27,3eqw5k,Investing conundrum. How to stay the course?,"Stay the course they say, but it's easier said than done.

I've been investing for 4 years mostly in growth stocks taking long term view. Here is my problem.

I am involved only when there is a bull market. I read and research a lot, check my account regularly and think more about my investments in general. Every little pullback in my stocks looks like an opportunity when market is in up swing. I end up doing most of the buying only during market up swing.

Complete opposite of that happens in the bear market. I'm cut off from the market and spend significantly less time researching. I don't go in panic sell mode but I am willing to lose a lot of good opportunities. This is when I mostly stay put and do nothing. 

I know it's a psychological thing, how do you guys deal with these emotions?

This is for a portfolio with long term holdings that you do not plan on selling for at least a year. Investing under the assumption that something negative will happen to the economy sometime in the near future (2-3 years?).

The companies:
Exelon (EXC) Utility company @ 30.66. This one is at 52 week lows at the moment. One of the biggest utility companies in the nation, with a merger just about complete. Good defensive stock that probably isn't going anywhere and pays a dividend.

Petrobras (PBR) Oil &amp; Gas @ 6.26. Also at record lows with the recent oil collapse and ongoing corruption scandal. This company isn't going anywhere since its majority owner is the govt. Risky due to the lack of independence, but has a lot of potential, and at a good price to make a purchase.

Coeur Mining Inc. (CDE) gold &amp; silver mining @ 3.78. At multiyear lows, but is very tied to the price of gold and silver which have done terribly in the past few years. They have made some seemingly good acquisitions and seem to have enough liquidity to weather the storm, although not sure exactly how long they could last. Gold mining companies can be a good counter cyclical investment.

Keep in mind that you are planning on holding for multiple years. Also you may be critical of the investments themselves, but this scenario is if you had to pick one of these three.

Interested to see what you all would pick!

15-07-28,3euo7p,What Fundamentals Affect Commodity Prices,"In the previous post I explained the basics of commodity investing. In this post, I’m going to explain exactly what fundamental factors affect commodity prices.

A Precursor
Commodity prices tend to rise and fall together, much like how stock prices rise and fall together. As the saying goes, “a rising tide lifts all boats”. If the entire U.S. economy is doing well, generally all stocks will go up. The fundamentals below impact all commodity prices.

Inflation
Inflation is a huge factor that can impact commodity prices. Thanks to the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement, all commodities are officially listed in U.S. dollars. Here are two important terms that you need to know

Nominal value
Real value
The nominal value of a commodity is the “official price”. If gold per ounce is at $1300 right now, then the nominal value is $1300. If inflation is 100% (a hypothetical scenario), then the nominal value of gold will also increase by 100%, doubling to $2600 per ounce.

The real value of a commodity takes into account for inflation. Let’s assume that gold is at $1300 an ounce. If inflation increases by 100%, the nominal value will increase, but the real value is exactly the same. There’s just more U.S. dollars chasing after the same amount of gold in this world!

As investors, we only care about the nominal value. Thus, when inflation picks up, commodity prices soar across the board! This is what happened in Germany with hyperinflation in the 1930’s – a loaf of bread cost a bajillion Marks (Germany’s currency at the time) to buy. The real value didn’t change (a loaf of bread is still a loaf of bread), but the nominal value exploded.

This is what happened in the U.S. during the 1970s (although it wasn’t as severe as it was in Germany). U.S. inflation skyrocked (14% per year), and commodity price spiked in the 1970s. Gold went from $30 an ounce to $600 an ounce.

Right now, we are seeing the early phases of inflation where inflation will pick up but has not started yet. Ben Bernake (Chairman of the Federal Reserve) has a genius solution to America’s economic woes – print money! That’s essentially the name of the game for his consecutive rounds of Quantitative Easing (QE). Sooner or later, this money printing is going to catch up to him (or us American taxpayers, actually) with huge inflation. And what happens when inflation hits? Commodity prices skyrocket.

Increased Demand, Decreased Supply
There is a fixed amount of supply in this world – it’s not like we can manufacture gold (alchemy!) or copper. On the other hand, demand is increasing exponentially. Can you imagine if every person in the world lived the way us Americans did! Considering the amount of stuff we waste each year (that’s how my relatives from Europe put it), the world’s resources would be depleted in a heart beat.

With developing nations increasing their standards of living, the world’s demand for raw materials such as oil and copper is outstripping supply. The Chinese are a huge buying force in the world – they are rebuilding their country after:

1800s: Britain literally robs China of all its gold and silver by drugging the entire nation with Opium (prior to the 1800s, drugs didn’t exist in China). It’s called The Century of Humiliation. China went from #1 in the world (literally, the “Middle Kingdom”) to dead last.
Early 1900s: Chinese Civil War
1950 – 1978: the Communist fiasco (Chairman Mao ruined China).
So really, China’s literally been rebuilding its entire country over the past 30 years. And because China is so big (both geographically and population wise), China consumes a ton of resources.

This trend in increasing demand and shrinking supply is only going to continue, thereby pushing up commodity prices. Factor in some more inflation thanks to King Bernake from the Federal Reserve, and you have the perfect set up for a long term bull market in commodities.

Thanks for reading! As I side note, I have something for y’all bloggers out there (and no, this is not an ad or a promotional gimmick). I’m trying out a new blogging software called Ghost for my site TradingSlugger.com. I like Ghost so much that I built a blog all about Ghost for beginners.

15-07-27,3ernfw,"Help me understand Terraform Power's financials and valuation","Terraform Power (TERP) is the Yieldco of SunEdison (SUNE). SunEdison builds solar and wind farms and then sells them to Terraform to operate. Terraform buys the projects off SunEdison (it can theoretically also buy other projects) and takes care of the operating and maintenance of the facilities. The reasoning is that in this way Terraform has a very predictable portfolio of projects generating predictable cash flows. This in turn facilitates lower rates on debt and lets SUNE cash in on one project to finance the next one, while its share in TERP also gives it long term dividend distributions from the plant operation.

Now, the problem I have in understanding TERP's business is in how to think about the different line items in the accounting statements. TERP has updated its predicted financials for the full year today (download pdf from here):  
[http://ir.terraform.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=253464&amp;p=irol-irhome](http://ir.terraform.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=253464&amp;p=irol-irhome)

The presentation is on how management thinks TERP equity is undervalued and will change the financing of the Vivint acquisition to include more debt instead of issuing equity. Looking at the statements on slide 14/15, I note the following:

1) Slide 14 first half starts with revenues minus costs resulting in $22.6M in Net Income. So far so good.  
2) Slide 14 second half calculates ""Adjusted EBITDA"" which seems rather meaningless to me: TERP borrows money to finance assets that depreciate and generate cash flows. On this slide we take the Net Income and add all the expenses back in - I'm not sure why that is helpful.  
3) Slide 15 first half does something similar: we take Net Income, we add the accounting line items that do not involve actual cash flow, and calculate Net Cash. This provides some insight into cash flow, I suppose.  
4) Slide 15 second half is where it gets interesting, although I have to admit that I don't fully understand some of the line items. However, I can see that we take the Net Cash flow, then take out some miscellaneous expenses, and call the result the CAFD - Cash Available For Distribution.

It seems then that on Net Income of $22.6M, we have added items of which by far the biggest is Depreciation, and call that CAFD of $321M. However, we have borrowed money against assets that do in fact depreciate, so it does not seem prudent to me to call that money ""available for distribution"" instead of paying off the debt or financing new projects. TERP has given guidance for $225M in actual cash distribution (dividend) for 2015. So it appears to me that TERP is borrowing money to buy depreciating assets that generate revenues, and paying the revenues out to shareholders, without actually using it for paying off the debt. Am I missing something here - **how does TERP justify paying out $225M in dividends on $22.6M in Net Income?** And am I right in thinking that valuation should be some multiple of that $22.6M instead of some multiple of the $225M?",6

For those who don’t know what introducing broker is: In futures trading, IB is the one who deals with clients and accepts orders. Although I have fair amount of specialized finance knowledge, my personal portfolio has done worse than most people’s.


I've been lucky to have my parents contribute to my IRA while I was still in school. If I hadn’t cashed out most of it for forex trading and blew it up, I’d be rich by now. 


There are many traders who make profit from forex trading. Plenty of information is available on the internet and anyone can learn how to trade forex. But it was not for me. 


Trading is all about psychology. Both trading failures and even successes can scar you. I was so traumatized at my mistakes and started questioning every move. I could also rationalize anything, especially my mistakes. As a result, I didn't cut net losses at right moment. 


At the end, I admitted that I was not capable of handling market moves. It took me a long time to admit the fact and decided to invest in index funds. I still work as futures IB, but I don’t do neither forex nor futures for my personal portfolio.

15-07-28,3ey049,I believe this is one of best portfolio allocations out there.,"I've spent probably 18+ hours coming up with a portfolio that has the perfect mixture of performance and defensive stability. 

* PJP 26%
* FXG 26%
* QQQ 26%
* TLT 12%
* AAPL 5%
* TSLA 5% 

The foundation of my portfolio is PJP(Dynamic Pharmaceuticals - 26% and FXG(Consumer Staples) - 26%. 

PJP is a selective biotech etf that invests in about 30 Pharmaceuticals that are selected on the basis of price momentum, earnings momentum, quality, management action, and value. There are only a few biotech etfs with higher 5-year average returns and it has the highest sharpe ratio of any biotech etf.

Consumer staples is another defensive sector that has performed well over the last several years and FXG is one of the best performing consumer staple etfs. 

Next I have 26% in QQQ, the Nasdaq. This gives me exposure the high performing technology sector. 

Next I have 12% in TLT(20 year treasuries). TLT has been one of the best performing bond ETFs over the last 10 years. 

Finally I have 5% in Apple and 5% in Tesla to provide some extra lift. 

Over the last 4 years, this portfolio has had a CAGR of 26%, a standard deviation of 10%, a max drawdown of 5% and a sharpe ratio of 2.29. 

Leaving off Tesla and starting from 2009(just after the recession), this portfolio has a CAGR of 23% vs 16% for the S&amp;P 500, standard deviation of 10%, max drawdown of 10% vs 18% for the S&amp;P 500, and a sharpe ratio of 2.15 vs 1.10 for the S&amp;P 500. 

Leaving off Tesla and starting from 2008(pre-recession), this portfolio has a CAGR of 16% vs 7% for the S&amp;P 500, standard deviation of 12%, max drawdown of 26% vs 48% for the S&amp;P 500, and a sharpe ratio of 1.30 vs 0.48 for the S&amp;P 500.

Eric Cusimano of Chautauqua county New York was sentenced to forty-six months in federal prison on Friday for victimizing 250 people in a penny stock scam. According to authorities, Cusimano and accomplice Jamie Boye, duped investors into buying worthless penny stocks at inflated prices. Cusimano’s wife Jessica was charged with money laundering in connection with the scheme.

U.S. District Court Judge Richard Arcara also ordered Mr. Cusimano to pay $657,000 in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service.

“You’re talking about a substantial white-collar crime,” the Judge Arcara said Friday. “This is a pretty significant fraud case, to say the least.”

Cusimano admitted taking part in a pump-and-dump stock scheme that artificially inflated the value of penny stocks and misled investors. He used consulting companies, newsletters and websites called bestdamnpennystocks.com and trypennystocks.com to put out misleading information that caused investors to buy stocks at highly inflated prices, according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Aaron J. Mango and Michael K. Klimczak, a criminal investigator with the Internal Revenue Service.

At least 60,000 investors subscribed to Eric Cusimano’s websites, investigators charged, alleging that he received at least $4.26 million to tout 26 penny stocks. Boye is accused of receiving at least $980,000 to tout 15 penny stocks.

Companies that issued stock would pay the defendants thousands of dollars to publish information pumping the stocks to investors.

Between 2009 and 2012, Eric Cusimano deposited more than $6 million in one of his bank accounts, and between 2008 and 2012, Boye deposited nearly $1.4 million in another account, federal agents charged.

“He was the No. 1 touter of penny stocks,” Mango said of Cusimano’s leadership role in the scheme. “He was the top guy.”

Defense attorney James W. Grable Jr. argued for leniency and suggested that the man awaiting sentencing on Friday is a far cry from the man who cheated investors.

“The guy who’s standing before you is a guy who’s going to do the right thing,” Grable said.

Investigators claim Cusimano took in nearly $8 million over a four-year period and made more than $1 million in unreported income as part of his scheme.

Cusimano pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and tax evasion. As part of his plea deal, he agreed to turn over foreign bank accounts in Belize and Panama and real estate in Lakewood and Frewsburg.",12
15-07-28,3evi0t,Casestudy: BeSi,"Hey all,

I would like to ask you about BeSi, besides the fact that it's currently my greatest loss stock of all times, it's also a weird stock, nothing i've seen before applies.

A week ago, after slightly disappointing numbers on the Q2, but fair numbers all around, they dropped a whopping 15%, the day after climbed 5% before lunch, then dropped down to -3% the same day. It's been dropping ever since with a steady -3 or -4%.

This is the second time this has happened to Besi (a cyclical stock), but this time it just seems to keep going down. Meanwhile, there is no news, no reaction from Besi itself or any real reason why this stock keeps sinking.

Does anyone know how this happens to a company? That even if it does well on paper, it kinda seems like investors are completely giving up on the stock.

The predicted goal is €31,-, according to Q2 material it should be worth 25-26, but it's currently down to 20,7 and sinking.
I'm holding on until it's back up to 25 or something, i'm just very curious about this phenomonon.

15-07-27,3esa1h,Is an allocation in bonds really worth it?,"I need some advice about if I should add bonds to my portfolio. I know the general consensus is you should always have at least 5-10% in bonds but after looking at the performance of even the best performing treasury bond etfs, I don't see their benefit. 

For example, TLT, ishares 20+ year Treasury Bond ETF has the highest 10-year average annual returns of any bond etf: 5.97%. At the height of the 2009 stock market crash(February 2009), the Dow had lost about 35% and TLT had gained about 6%. 

Pretend I'm 40. A common formula for determining bond-stock allocation is 100-age. So if I'm 40, I should have 40% in bonds and 60% in equities. Starting from a baseline in 2005, at the height of the stock market crash my portfolio would have lost 21%(35% * 60%) due to the 35% decline in equities and gained only 2.4%(6% * 40%) due to the 6% rise in TLT. The percentage loss due to equities would have been 10x larger than the percentage gain from bonds. 

TLT did rise higher a few months earlier but this was before equities fell to their deepest point. At this point, my portfolio would have lost 10.8%(18% * 60%) due to a 18% decline in equities and gained only 8.8%(22% * 40%) due to a 22% rise in TLT. Here the difference in returns is more equal but again, this was just a moment halfway into the recession. The stock market continued to fall and the value of bonds did not increase and equal out of the fall in value of equities. And all these numbers are from an allocation based of 40 years of age. For younger people, the allocation to bonds would have been even less helpful. 

You could also argue that TLT was simply an ETF that did not perform that well during this period. However, in addition to having the highest annual return over the last 10 years of any bond etf, it also has the 2nd highest sharpe ratio over the last 5 years. If you wouldn't pick the bond etf with the highest return over the last 10 years and 2nd highest sharpe ratio, which one would you pick? For any bond etf that is more sensitive to the market, there is the danger that any additional benefit gained during bear markets is offset by worse returns during bull markets. 

From what I understand, the purpose of including bonds in a portfolio is that they increase in value during market downturns when equities decrease in value, reducing the volatility of portfolio value. Sure that happens some, but this small payoff does not seem large enough to make up for the return lost by not putting the money into equities.

15-07-27,3ese55,Ponzi Scheme Operator Sentenced to Six Years in Prison,"www.StockPromoters.com

Claude Darrell McDougal, 56, formerly of Charlotte, was sentenced to 78 months in prison for orchestrating a Ponzi scheme that defrauded his investor victims of over $2.5 million, announced Jill Westmoreland Rose, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina.

As well as prison time, U.S. District Judge Max O. Cogburn, Jr. ordered McDougal to serve two years under court supervision after he is released from prison and to pay $2,020,078.26 as restitution to the victims of his fraud.

According to court documents, from 2006 to 2010 McDougal induced over 25 investors in Charlotte and elsewhere to invest more than $2.5 million, by promising his victims their money would be invested in securities, in the form of promissory notes offered by “US Financial Alliance Consultants, LLC” (Financial Alliance). McDougal created Charlotte-based Financial Alliance in 2005, a company that was never registered as a dealer of securities in North Carolina or elsewhere.
 
Court documents show that McDougal induced his victims to invest with Financial Alliance by falsely “guaranteeing” fixed rates of return between 6 percent and 15 percent annually.
 
McDougal collected over $2.5 million dollars from victim-investors, many of whom were elderly and invested most, if not all, of their life-savings with him. Instead of investing the victims’ money as promised, McDougal squandered it.
 
According to court records, over the course of the three-year scheme, McDougal invested only $580,000 of the victims’ money and used approximately $450,000 to pay some victims supposed “payouts” from profits made on investments. However, these payments were not based on profits, but came from funds contributed by new investors, commonly referred to as Ponzi payments. Court records show that McDougal used approximately $1.19 million of the investors’ funds to support his own lifestyle, including to buy dinners, jewelry and electronics, and to pay for hotel stays, furniture and other business-related expenses.
 
McDougal pleaded guilty to securities fraud in July 2014.
 
Following the sentencing hearing McDougal was released on bond. He will be ordered to report to the Federal Bureau of Prisons upon designation of a federal facility. All federal sentences are served without the possibility of parole.",9

A stock is only worth what the market is wiling to pay for it. The market doesn't care what price you bought it for, or the maximum unrealized gain you had before it fell.

This is data for over the last 2 years and comes from portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio.

So it seems at least in a bull market, QQQE is a slightly less volatile version of QQQ.  

My main question is how it would behave in a bear market…which depends on what tends to fall faster/harder in a bear market: the smaller but less overbought companies or the larger but more overbought companies?

Historically, this meant that jews would not plant or harvest crops and the economy would be lousy. The whole point of the Shmitah is that it is a year of rest.

Well, wsb, we are in a Shmitah year right now. September 2014 - September 2015 is a Shmitah year.

The last Shmitah year? 2008, the great recession. The Shmitah year before that? 2001, tech bubble burst.

The end of this Shmitah is very close to when Mr. Yellen and the whole fed crew plan on raising rates. If rates are raised, there will a) be widespread panic and selloff, and b) companies will not be able to freely borrow money to buy back and boost their stock price. 

Conspiracy aside, here is my prediction: A big correction/increase in volatility in the last quarter of 2015.

How to make money: Buy VIX calls and hold them until expiration. The best time to do it was probably last Monday but when Yellen speaks this week the markets may calm down and there may be a good opportunity again. 

A friend of mine spotted someone putting $2m into August calls last week on ToS and they're up 25% already. Good luck WSB. 

If this all goes to plan, I will be flying to the Bahamas on December 27th, 2015, and you're all invited to join me.

Say i buy AAPL at 125 3 weeks ago. I buy 10 shares. 

Then the price drops to 123 2 weeks ago. I buy another 10 shares. Now my average price paid for 20 shares in 124. 

Lets say last week, I bought another 20 shares at 122.

Now i owned 40 shares total, with an average price paid of 123.

If the price of AAPL goes up to... say 130, that means I made a 7 bucks a share when I bought more when the price fell vs. 5 bucks a share when I made my first investment 3 weeks ago at 125 and didnt add any shares when the price continued to drop.

So wouldn't it be wise to continue to invest in a company whose share price is lowering that is expected the gain slow and steady returns (AAPL for example) to bring down the average price paid and therefore increase gains when the price rises?

Another idea would be instead to buy a rental, so you can get the benefits of getting on the property ladder while at the same time keep the flexibility of renting a property fit for your needs.

Why would you opt for a rental?
Well as I said above, the first thing that comes to mind is that your local property market may not be ideal for home ownership if priced are on the rise. The rent vs buy calculations may not lean towards buying in overpriced housing bubbles. But you live there, so you still need a place to stay. What better way to have someone pay your rent while you build up equity on the property they live in?

You may not make enough to buy a place in New York, but already have savings that would represent a hefty deposit in Kansas City. And the rent would bring a better return on your deposit than the 0.1% your cash is bringing right now.

If you are living with a significant other, and not ready to put both names on the deed, it allows you to keep your place together while you start investing on your own.

And if you are just starting your career, you should not get tied to a property when your next job could be 3,000 miles away.

By buying a rental, you could move pretty much anywhere without worrying about having to sell your home before doing so. That is what I did with my UK property. I lived there for less than a year (with roommates) before putting the whole place up for rent and moving to Morocco. Now, I am still a continent away, and on top of that have put six time zones between my property and myself. And you know what? It works out just fine.

My tenants each rent a bedroom on separate contracts, and when one is about to vacate, they interview potential tenants to find the new roommate. I take care of bills and include them in their rent so they don’t have to fight about splitting them equally. The only little bumps on the way are generally about cleaning habits of some of them, so I am thinking about raising the rents and including a weekly cleaner. Other than this, if the washing machine or the heater breaks, I just send a handyman and wire them the money.

So I wouldn’t be worried about having a property two hours drive away, if one ocean away is doable.

What I thought before I left was that the rent I would get from the bedroom I used to occupy, around $1,000, would basically cover my rental needs anywhere in the world. Yes, $1,000 is pretty expensive for a room, but that is under market price when said room is in an affluent suburb of London. I have only had one week vacancy in one of the rooms over the past 5 years.

In Guatemala, $1,000 happens to cover my entire living expenses and the salaries of two staff, because I paid cash for my house, but it would more than cover my rent of a three bed luxury condo in a great neighborhood of Guatemala City. Even in Europe, aside from London, Paris and a few overpriced capitals, I could get a comfy two bedroom and live on my own. And if I felt like going back to Paris for a while, $1,000 would still get me an independent, albeit smaller unit.

I really like that the money from rent can be allocated to my living expenses, just like the time my motorcycle insurance company paid for some advertising on my blogs, enough to cover two years of bike insurance. You get the idea, getting a fixed source of income gives you the freedom of using that same income to cover the same category of expense for your flexible life.

 

Where should you buy a property?
If you have a nomadic lifestyle like I do, the world is pretty much your oyster. And if your career could take you anywhere in the country, buying next to where you live now may not be buying where your next job will be, so once again, you could look at your whole state, or your whole country. Some ideas include

- A college town. Students rarely buy a place during their college years, and you have a constant influx of potential new tenants. I am in a college town and my prices deter the freshmen so usually I get the PhD students or the recent graduates working their first job. They are serious, and often have mum and dad behind, which is extra consolation.

- Your hometown. While you may not live there at the beginning of your career, you may aspire to come back once you settle down and start a family. Plus your parents could keep an eye on the property, send their trusted handyman to do maintenance or chase payments face to face for you. You don’t want to be a burden but it gives you some peace of mind to know there is still a family member nearby if things go sour. You are also able to make an educated decision about each neighborhood without too much research, as you lived there for years.

- The highest yielding market. A quick online search will tell you which markets offer the highest rent in your region of choice.

- The best house you can afford on a high down payment. Things may not always go the way you planned and your property may sit empty for a while, and having low repayments will make life much easier. You could look for a place that is affordable right now, and put a 30-50% deposit on it, so the rent is only a fraction of the repayments. That will also allow you to live on the surplus should you lose your job, to pay off the rest of the mortgage early as well, or to set aside a good chunk of money for future renovations.

- A duplex. When you live a nomadic lifestyle, you often want a base to come home to. Buying a duplex or a triplex allows you to have renters pay most of the housing costs while you still keep a small unit as your own to store your stuff and re-energize when you are tired of traveling. Plus they serve as free house sitters!",1

15-07-28,3ewibm,New Charges Brought Against Ninja Energy Drink CEO,"www.StockPromoters.com

Eric Morgan can now add three charges of fraud to the 15 counts of securities fraud he has already been charged with. According to Evansville, Indiana police, since his arrest on July 7, Morgan was caught cashing fraudulent checks at an Evansville bank and at a local car dealership.

The Evansville, Indiana man was arrested in early July after investigators claim that he bilked four individuals out of more than $600,000. The victims, according to the Indiana Secretary of State’s office, thought they were investing in Morgan’s energy drink company. But instead, they say, he used the money for his own personal gain.

All securities professionals and investment products need to be licensed by the state and neither were. Morgan did not tell any of the investors that he was not registered to sell securities or that Liquid Ninja was not a registered security with the Secretary of State’s office, as required by law, according to a probable cause affidavit.

The investigation began when the Secretary of State’s office received a complaint about Morgan from a couple living in Spencer County, according to the affidavit filed by the Vanderburgh County Prosecutor’s office, which became involved because Morgan was a resident of Evansville and ran Liquid Ninja, his company, from the city.

Among the victims were an older couple for whom Morgan was a financial adviser, according to the affidavit. Morgan reportedly first mentioned Liquid Ninja to them in December 2012 and talked to them about it more in subsequent visits.

That couple paid Morgan a $250,000 cashier’s check in April 2014. Seven days later, $142,187 was drawn from Liquid Ninja’s account in the form of a cashier’s check payable to an individual in Spencer County, according to the affidavit.

Morgan gave the couple a promissory note for their investment that said they would receive 7.5 percent interest for two years, paid annually. The note also said that at the end of the two years the couple would either get back the principal of their investment or a 15 percent ownership of the company.

Morgan’s profile on the professional social media service LinkedIn identifies him as being owner of Liquid Ninja since October 2012. It also lists him as owner of BL&amp;C financial services.",5

15-07-29,3f01ud,Everyone get back in $AMDA!! I figured out who the OEM partner for this latest annoucement is! Lots of DD,"Our OEM partnership is with: **Ortho Development** (http://www.odev.com/)

&amp;nbsp;

- From 8-k filing: ""leading orthopedic device design and manufacturing company"". What is the only company that matches this exact wording when you google it? Ortho Development! Its part of their ""Company Profile: About us/Mission statement""

- Where is Ortho Development located? **Salt Lake City/Draper**, right down the street from Amedica!

- Here is the SEC link for that 8-k filing: http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1269026/000126902615000009/a20150723_8-kxorthodevelop.htm. What is at the end of the link? ""**8-kxorthodevelop.htm**"" Hmm where did they get this url from...

- Here is the raw submission text file of that 8-k to the SEC: http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1269026/000126902615000009/0001269026-15-000009.txt. Look under &lt;title&gt;...they named their document ""2015.07.23_8-K - **Ortho Development OEM Announcement**"".

&amp;nbsp;

Now to the nitty gritty: Ortho Development is owned by **Japan Medical Dynamic Marketing, INC.**(TYO:7600). https://www.google.com/finance?q=TYO:7600
&amp;nbsp;

-  Japan MDM has a 15.3B yen market cap = **125MM USD market cap**
&amp;nbsp;

- Their 2015 sales will be 11.9B Yen = **95MM USD net sales** (http://www.jmdm.co.jp/eng/ir/finance)
&amp;nbsp;

- Their ""core product"" is the **artificial knee joint**, with hip joint coming in second on priorities (from this disclosure translated: http://www2.tse.or.jp/disc/76000/140120150129013733.pdf). Amedica's spinal products and future products, such as Silicon nitride femoral heads, will be a great fit for them. 
&amp;nbsp;

- They are looking to expand their sales/footprint in the US through acquisitions and mergers to gain new products (also in above document). 
&amp;nbsp;

- Here is an investor presentation for Japan MDM: http://www2.tse.or.jp/disc/76000/140120150513474783.pdf (very similar and worth scrolling through is the most recent Amedica Investors presentation: http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AMDA-2JBRND/343872970x7936078x805552/05AD15F6-AD32-4A08-943F-1485D31258DB/AMDA_Investor_Presentation_May_2015.pdf)
&amp;nbsp;

Also please listen to the webcast of the CASCADE 12 month results (http://edge.media-server.com/m/p/v3sqw235). Significant results are: 

- **1) Equal outcomes in neck disability index (neck discomfort decreased over time for both PEEK and Silicon Nitride, no significant difference between groups)**

- **2) Silicon nitride WITHOUT autograft showed comparable rates of fusion and comparable clinical improvement to the current gold standard: PEEK WITH plating or autograft**

- **3) ""Silicon nitride is as good as bone autograft and no other synthetic material has shown this""**

- **4) ""Amedica's composite silicon nitride device is sufficient without the need for bone autograft or bone fillers and has inherent superior imaging capabilities""**

- **5) Now that we know that Silicon Nitride is at least equivalent to the golden standard PEEK, why use Silicon Nitride composite over PEEK? (other than for superior imaging capabilities) There is bone ingrowth completely around Silicon Nitride composite (even outer shell) while there is no fusion to the inert plastic portion of PEEK (leading to abrasion degradation over time, other companies try to get around this by coating with titanium/hydroxylapatite but this sloughs off over time too). Silicon Nitride is also anti-infective &amp; antibacterial while PEEK is not, so if your PEEK implant gets infected, the surgeon will have to go back in, dig out the PEEK plastic, and replace it**

- FDA is waiting for 24 month results when the **trial finishes in September 2015** (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT01511445?spons=Amedica&amp;rank=2). From IR: ""The CASCADE trial ends in September 2015, FDA clearance could in theory come as soon as **OCTOBER 2015** (Q4 2015) or as late as Q1 2016 as stated in the press release"" 

&amp;nbsp;

I would also like to address buyout rumors. In my opinion the ""buyout"" will not be an acquisition but instead a merger (possibly with Ortho DEV/Japan MDM). This can happen **ANYTIME**. Both before or after the cervical CsC FDA 510k clearance we applied for (remember this is an application for additional uses for the composite silicon nitride). The company has over **51 issued patents** worldwide that are VERY valuable. Amedica is also the ONLY FDA &amp; CE cleared Silicon Nitride medical device manufacturer in the world (from above investor presentation). Also I'd like to mention Amedica already has **thirteen (13)** 510k FDA clearances. The recent 8-k for **""Change in Control"" agreement** (http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1269026/000126902615000008/a20150722_8-kxitem502coc.htm) is very good supporting evidence for these rumors. This demonstrates that management has aligned their interests with shareholders to get the most value out of the stock. Read below for more information:

&amp;nbsp;

""Change-in-Control agreements, sometimes referred to as ""golden parachutes,"" compensate executives for loss of job due to mergers or sale. Executives are fiduciaries, charged with taking action in the best interest of the company and the shareholders. However, CEOs face inherent difficulties when it comes to a merger or a sale of the business, the end result of which will result in the executive losing their position. Change-in-Control agreements are structured to encourage executives to seek out and enter into sale or merger opportunities when it is in the best interest of the shareholders without having reservations about losing their own positions.""

15-07-29,3f049n,A new idea for how we should allocate our stocks vs. bonds!,"One of the issues I’ve come across here on /r/investing/ is how people allocate their investment within stocks and bonds. Typically I see people placing a certain percentage based on how much risk they want to take on. For instance, the 110-your age approach to how much of your portfolio should be stocks. Eg: 35 year olds like myself should be **75%** invested in stocks and **25%** in bonds. The classic point of this is to limit risk when a person is aged and has less earning power, and to maximize returns (and risk) when a person is young and resilient. 

But lately I’ve been rethinking if this is the right approach. Perhaps there is a better way to structure the allocation. For example: the portion-matches-your-age rule may be a good rule when you have a small investment, but when you have $2,000,000 to invest and you’re 30 years old, do you really need 20% in bonds? $400,000? I don’t think so.


Here’s my idea: **layering the investments based on cost of living and estimated timespan for positive returns.**


* Cash: 12 months of living expenses
* Bonds: 5 years of living expenses
* *Stocks: Everything else*


Bonds are a great investment for keeping above inflation in the coming five years. But stocks are a much better long term growth investment. 


If you have a massive health emergency and lose your job, you simply use your emergency fund and slowly shift everything to the safer side. So the bonds would refill the emergency fund and (over five years, as the market allows) the stocks would become bonds. IE: [if you backtest](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation) a 60% US stock 40% international stock annually-rebalanced portfolio, it has always recovered any loss within five years (worse year was 2008, recovered by 2012).


Example: say your cost of living is $50K/year. This would mean you need to save:


* Cash: $50,000
* Bonds: $250,000
* *Stocks: Everything else*

15-07-29,3f2mfe,The pain continues for semi-conductors. QRVO plunges nearly 17% afterhours. SWKS and AVGO fall as well.,"QRVO is down after-hours due to a cut in guidance. SWKS and AVGO fall in sympathy, as well as NXPI.

NXPI reports later this evening. AVGO next week. 

I made a thread earlier warning to stay away from these stocks. Looks like my suspicions were confirmed at least for the short term. 



EDIT: I think this shows that SWKS is clearly the very best of this group. Amazing fundamentals. Watch for SWKS to hit the 200ema. Last time that happened was October 2014 and it bounced right off sky high. If SWKS does indeed hit that 200ema again(I think its about $84 now and it may not get there), its the absolute perfect buying opportunity. This is of course all assuming that nothing changes for SWKS(revised guidance, etc). It is absolutely being unfairly beat up. This is a very competitive space so if you like to pick stocks, you need to go with the winners. QRVO is a loser.

Two months after Stuart M. Rubens, 62, of North Miami, Dean R. Baker, 35, of Coral Springs, and Bret A. Grove, 36, of Delray Beach were sentenced to federal prison for their roles in a boiler room operation that fraudulently peddled shares in a company they claimed was developing technology for the NFL, authorities have rounded up eight additional folks they say were involved in the scheme.

Charged with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud were David Anthony Eratostene, 53, of Miramar, Christopher J. Borgo, 41, of Boca Raton, Alan D. Messina, 54, of Sunrise, Michael T. Angeletti, 33, of Sunrise, Michael J. Calash 34, of Boca Raton, Stephen R. Reynolds, 38, of Pompano Beach, Gary X. Schultz, 55, of Miramar, and Chazon Stein, 36, of North Miami Beach.

The SEC brought charges against the original group men in September of 2013 for operating a South Florida boiler room scam that defrauded seniors and other investors they pressured into purchasing stock in a company that purportedly developed ground-breaking technology for the National Football League to use in the Super Bowl.

According to the original complaint, Peter Kirschner and his business partner Stuart Rubens of North Miami struck an agreement with Thought Development Inc. (TDI) to solicit investors and sell unregistered company stock to help the Miami Beach-based company raise capital. TDI states that its signature invention is a laser-line system that generates a green line on a football field that is visible as a first-down marker not only on television, but also within the stadium to players, fans, and officials. TDI claims its technology would decrease the time needed by officials to determine first downs and generate more time to be sold to television advertisers.

There were a few problems with the pitch, the feds assert — besides the exorbitant, undisclosed commissions, there was misrepresentation that the technology was about to be picked up the NFL and forgetting to mention it posed a risk of blindness to players.

Ultimately, the men pressured investors to throw nearly $3 million in two companies, Miami Beach-based Thought Development Inc. and Virgin Gaming, officials said.

They all face federal prison terms and restitution to the bilked victims.",6

15-07-29,3f0mzq,Another aspect of Mutual funds vs. Individual stocks.,"Someone, I give financial advise to, has been retired for a few years, is now age 60 with large assets and low income.  Against my previous advice she has no individual stocks.  She has mutual funds in taxable accounts and mutual funds in IRAs (rolled over from 401Ks) and has EE bonds expiring in 2017.  Because of Obamacare, she has strong reason to hit a specific income without going over it in each of 2015, and 2016.  She has asked my assistance in figuring out when and how much to cash EE bonds early to reduce the taxes she will owe in 2017 (and for current cash flow), without going over those income limits in 2015 or 2016.  
  
Most of her mutual funds in taxable accounts have significant taxable distributions late in December with near zero advance notice and no official pre estimate of the amount.  Using 2014 as an estimate for 2015 is not very safe for such purposes.  If she had instead invested in a mix of individual stocks, she would have a much better estimate of full year taxable distributions much earlier in the year.  
  
There are a lot of situations (not just Obamacare) for which a retiree with high assets may have good reason to cap recognized income for an individual year, but up to that cap have many different forms of stored unrealized income, that could be recognized.  I'm posting this anecdote, to point out the situation that may arise years from now for many of those getting investment advise in this forum now.  Once you have unrealized gains, it is too late to switch assets for tax advantage from Mutual funds to individual stocks.  So you should understand why individual stocks purchased now will give you more flexibility to optimize tax and income issues later (as compared to Mutual funds).  
  
Tax loss harvesting, during your peak earning years, is the usual reason I give for saying those investing larger amounts now should be in individual stocks, not mutual funds.  But this anecdote points out an extra reason independent of tax loss harvesting.  
  
I'm still not trying to talk to the majority here.  If you want to invest $3K now and maybe a couple more $K per year for the next several years, even in a taxable account, I wouldn't suggest individual stocks.  But for those jumping in at five figure investing heading for six or seven figure, individual stocks from the start, will pay off with tax flexibility later.

* Brokerage: Fidelity

* Roth IRA - 5.5K - Cash
* Longshot Stocks: 6K - TSLA, PFPT, FEYE &amp; Visa

Yearly Contributions for 2014/15:

* 401K: 18K - 87% (Traditional 68% &amp; 31% Roth 401K)
* Roth IRA: 5.5 - 23%

* 5 Year: 12.78%

My Questions and Thoughts: 

*  Am I crazy or is the 2051+ fund performing pretty terribly and the expense ration seems a little high?
* Recommendations for Roth IRA 5.5K into something: I was considering investing in ETF or mutal funds: IVW or FSTMX 
*  Roth vs Traditional at 110K salary?  Im in a pretty high tax bracket and I'm not sure which one I should be doing.

15-07-29,3f19sp,"Need some advice as a newbie looking at IPO's and what company to use to trade with.","I've never traded stock before. I've thought about it, but never had the funds to invest. Now, I have a new job making good money. The company I work for will allow me to purchase stock at a discount, which I plan to do when I can. This got me thinking to looking at other stocks, though. I thought I'd look into IPO's to see if I could find a good company starting out and get in at the beginning to hopefully have a good return over a longer term (basically, I'm not looking to buy a stock today and sell it in a year, I'm thinking I'd hang on to it and hopefully their business ramps up after a few years). 


I came across Aquas Metals, basically a lead-acid battery recycler. With more EV's coming out, and lead-acid batteries being the most cost effective means to power them (especially as more research is done to make them longer lasting, etc) I feel there's a good chance this company is relied on for EV batteries. Tesla is using something different, but that also makes their cars cost more. Companies of standard every day driver cars seem like they'd continue to rely on lead-acid. Obviously, that's the risk I have, if the car companies go a different route and this company has no business base, but am I right in thinking this could be worth the risk?


They are starting this Friday at $5/share. I know from reading some other posts here, that low cost share's aren't necessarily a good thing, I feel this is just a good option to start out and give this a shot and not worry about losing too much if it doesn't pan out. I think I would start with 100 shares (so $500). 


What do you think of this company and this investment? Should I go for it, or continue researching other companies? Should I still look at IPO's or look at established companies?

Now with this deal with Micron regarding the 3D XPoint memory architecture, it seems like this will likely become the standard in a few years (NAND is mostly the standard today and has been for a few decades). Now I see this being huge for both companies, but for Intel mostly. I see them pulling revenues from this tech within the next few quarters, but I have no way in knowing by how much.

15-07-29,3f1fuu,My dummy investing strategy has earned me 150 percent return in three years. Is it sustainable or plain stupid?,"Background: I'm a rising senior in college. I've been using a stock market simulator app to feel out the market since my senior year in high school. I've used a very simple strategy that has more than doubled my starting funds. 

I simply look at a website that grades stocks based on predicted returns. Then I buy 4 of the highest rated stocks in different industries, dividing my bankroll by 4. I wait for my portfolio to increase by around 5%, then I sell and repeat.

If my portfolio hasn't increased in 3-5 months, I'll also sell and start over. 

I'm aware that this has happened during a really strong upswing in the market, and that decisions are a lot easier to make when you're dealing with fake money. But say I maintain this strategy when I start to acquire some capital after graduation - maybe increasing to 8 stocks instead of 4. 

Would it be wise to continue using this strategy given my past success, or would it be smarter to get a standard Vanguard account?

Here is a graph of my portfolio. The large upswing and downswing were glitches in the app that corrected themselves after a few days.

This is the scenario, a company, say Apple, had 200 million dollars worth of shorts on its stock. The next day that amount went down to 50 million dollars. 

He claims that this means there is market pressure towards INCREASING the price of the stock. Thus, that because the number of short positions declined by 74%, this is an indicator that the stock price is likely to RISE.

While in theory he is right, I claim that the reduction in short positions will have no effect on the stock price whatsoever. Since shirt deals are made outside of the trading floors, usually at brokers, thus below normal trading this reduction won't have any effect on the stock price. Actually, I claim that it would be impossible to even gather that data since there is no public source of information that keeps track of all the short deals that are going on. Since these deals are all done privately there is no way the number of them will effect stock pricing.   

Who's right? Who's wrong? And if you could please attach your source that would be awesome.

I'm a finance/ accounting student set to graduate this december and I'm currently applying to, and in communication with, a few proprietary trading firms in Chicago. The first step in the application process for one prop trading firm/ market maker is to take a math test. The recruiter told me that if I pass the test I will make it to the next step of interviews. What kind of questions can I expect to see? Is there a specific way to prepare myself for this test? I'm assuming since the firm is dealing with derivatives there could be a significant amount of calculus on the test. I did fine in calculus but I was originally an engineering major and did all the math through the school of engineering. Most option pricing that I have been exposed to was done by using a calculator or excel file. 

Second, I read in their job descriptions that knowledge of Python is a huge plus.  During my summer internship in commercial banking I learned some basic Python to integrate excel spreadsheets with a few databases.

The company provides two-factor authentication solutions, which ensure secure user login and only authenticated user access.
It also offers electronic signature, which confirms the authenticity and integrity of a financial transaction. Some of VDSI’s offerings include: VACMAN, IDENTIKEY Authentication Server, DIGIPASS for APPS, DIGIPASS clients and MYDIGITPASS.COM, as well as IDENTIKEY Appliance, IDENTIKEY Virtual Appliance and IDENTIKEY Federation Server. VASCO Data Security sells its security solutions through its direct sales force, distributors, resellers and systems integrators.
In early May, VASCO walloped estimates for the first quarter. Earnings grew 278% year-over-year to $0.34 per share, which beat analysts’ estimates for $0.21 per share by 61.9%. Sales increased 67.8% year-over-year to $65.1 million, which beat the consensus estimate for $54.5 million by 19.4%.
In just a few hours, VASCO is scheduled to release its second-quarter results. The consensus estimate is for $0.28 EPS on $64.67 million in revenue. Compared with Q2 2014, this translates to 64.7% earnings growth and 35.7% sales growth. I’m looking for VASCO to beat expectations once again. VDSI is an A-rated Strong Buy.

Formerly known as Tiger Media, Inc., this small-cap changed its name to IDI Inc. in April 2015. The company was founded in 2005 and is based in Boca Raton, Florida.

The company has come under fire recently as no less than four boutique law firms have file suit against IDI seeking to recover damages for investors under the federal securities laws.

According to documents filed with the courts, officers and directors of IDI, Inc. are alleged to have violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 between April 30, 2015 and July 21, 2015, by making materially false and misleading statements about IDI's business prospects.  

IDI officials failed to disclose adverse information concerning Michael Brauser, who was elected to IDI's board on June 2, 2015, and became Executive Chairman of the company on June 16, 2015. On April 30, 2015, IDI filed a proxy statement with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission in connection with its annual shareholders’ meeting to elect members of its Board of Directors. The proxy statement, which included biographical information about Brauser as a director nominee, failed to disclose that Brauser was named as a defendant in various civil fraud litigation, was co-owner of a telecommunications firm that filed for bankruptcy, and was sued in an adversary proceeding related to that firm.
 
The complaint further alleges that the disclosure of the company's legal proceedings in its 2015 Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2015, was incomplete and misleading. The 10-Q mentioned that the company was being sued by TransUnion Risk and Alternative Data Solutions, Inc., but failed to disclose that an adverse ruling could have an immediate near-term impact on the company's financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.
 
On July 21, 2015, Seekingalpha.com published an article detailing Brauser's involvement in multiple lawsuits and stating that IDI's TransUnion lawsuit could render IDI's stock worthless. The same day, the company's stock fell $5.26 per share, or over 46%, to close at $6.16 per share.
 
As for the market, IDI closed out the day Tuesday at $10.2, a gain of 10.27 percent with a return on investment of -29.80 percent trading at a volume of 107,471 shares. The company is performing above average, with a weekly performance of 65.58 percent moving into this week with a quarterly performance of 60.24 percent and a 52-week low of 353.33 percent. IDI’s monthly performance sits at -13.12 percent and 3.49 percent insider transactions. ",4

* Over time, I am now one of the biggest share holders of this company. 

* When the time is right, I sell off all my shares at once. 

* This causes other shareholders to panic and they start dumping their shares. 

* The share price plummets. Eventually going much lower than I originally bought it fore. 

* I take my revenue I earned from the sale when the share price was higher and use it to buy even more shares than before at this much lower rate.

* With increased buying, the share price starts to rise again. 

* When it's above a certain level, I sell it off again making more money than I had originally.

15-07-30,3f44ym,Margin Investing: When is it Worth It? (with specific example),"Hi guys, I was hoping someone could make sure I'm not way out in left field with my thinking on Margin Investing. I wanted to see when margin investing would beat the alternative of simple buy-and-hold and the math told me:

Leverage Ratio &gt; I / (G - I)

where G = total gains on the security
    and I = loan interest rate

So if I took out a 4.25% margin loan to buy a garden-variety S&amp;P 500 index returning a total of 6% annually, I'd need to be levered **1:2.5** before it starts being the better option? Not to mention, assuming a worst-case 1-day drop of 2.6%, that means the margin strategy would force me to keep an additional 6.5% of my own initial investment set aside as a cushion.

This seems like a crappy strategy. Have I missed anything glaringly obvious? Thanks!",1

So this will require A TON of money.. where do you turn to? Loaning or finding investors.. this is what I don't understand

you have 2 investors.. Investor A is worth (net worth) of $1.2B and Investor B is worth $2.2B .. this would leave us at $3.4B (if they threw there net worth away I know I know this is just hypothetical).

If one REALLY good popular ride costs $100M (I want 270 rides) so thats $27,000,000,000 and for other expenses and maintence fees, paying the employees.. 27B is a TON of money. Not even big business mogul's have that much in net worth..

So my question is. How do they get $27B and how does the investors get $27B, and how does investors make money if your (in this case amusement park) is a booming success

15-07-30,3f543q,The day my roommates paid for my apartment,"Five years ago, I bought a 3 bed property in a lovely college town the UK. I shouldn’t brag too much about it and break my lucky strike, but since day one, I found a friendly roommate to share part of the mortgage with, and my then-boyfriend was also pitching in a below market rent, 30% lower than what we had been paying our landlord in our previous rental. It made his parents furious that I was getting rich on his back, but he didn’t want to buy a place, didn’t have a dime for a deposit, so I considered it fair that he would contribute towards our living expenses.

Anyway, for a while, it was the two of us in a room, the roommate in another one, and a third guest bedroom where we had a desk, and most of our clothes in the closet. We did have a few guests that summer so it was nice to have a spare bed, but came September, students came back to the college town and I took a second roommate in.

We were just a little more cramped in the room, but the deal was with the extra rent my boyfriend would pay even less rent, and I would pay for treats like restaurants and travel, so he was on board pretty fast.

A year later, we broke up, I moved out and relocated to Morocco, and the two roommates stayed, with a third one moving into “my room”. I knew I wouldn’t be back anytime soon and wasn’t leaving any personal stuff behind, so I had no problems renting it. With the $875 I was getting by renting that room alone, I had enough to find a nice place on my own in Casablanca.

Fast forward five years, and the roommates have come and gone, and been generally good people looking after the place and warning me if something goes wrong. They have recruited their successor every time they moved out, and chosen those people carefully. In return, I have been a good landlady and changed heaters and washing machines as soon as they break.

The property is cash flow positive since I left, by a few hundred dollars each month. And this month marks the day the accumulated cash flow reached the price of the down payment I forked out when I first bought.

So basically, thank you, roommies, for buying me that property!

 

The feeling is great because now, this property cost me absolutely nothing. The rents have covered the deposit, the legal fees, the furnishing costs, the heater repairs… everything. I could sell it at any price and still make money since my cost is $0.

Imagine you get a $200,000 property and put $40,000 down. The $500 positive cash flow every month means that under 7 years, your tenants will have repaid your deposit back. At the same time, they are also repaying capital on your mortgage, slowly buying you the other $160,000 of the property.

That is why I love investing in real estate. If the bank was more understanding of my weird self-employment status, I would have more rental units, although managing a property from the distance can get complicated if you happen to get a bad tenant.

 

In the meanwhile, the rent surplus now more than covers my housing expenses in Guatemala, so not only am I getting a free property, they are also putting a roof over my head. Real estate is awesome.

 

Do you own a property? Do you see the positive cash-flow as your tenants paying off your down payment?",1

15-07-30,3f7m0l,$LNKD Earnings Release - After hours craze,"$LNKD released earnings numbers, stock went up by 12% after hours, and now trading around 218 which is -4%. Do you think this is just people making quick money or is there another reason behind the sudden peak and drop?",10
15-07-30,3f7m90,How can I use real world events to research stock options to invest in?,"So that is my question in the title. Let me elaborate with an example so you can see where I might have got lucky and what tips you can give me to do better. Right now I am only investing smaller amounts of money as I learn the ropes.


I am a runner. Last year there was a runner sponsored by Sketchers that was favorite to win the Boston Marathon. I also noticed that Sketchers was schedule to report their earnings a week after the marathon. So I bought a few call contracts. The Sketchers sponsored athlete won the Boston Marathon and earning reports were good. The stock rose and I eventually ended up roughly doubling my money.

For this year's Boston Marathon the same runner was set to run. I bought more call options before the race. He did not win, but another good earnings report started pushing the stock higher. I rode this one out a little longer first sellling a couple contracts to cover the cost and then later selling a couple more contracts to pay off a credit card. I held on to a little bit more until this morning when a super charged earnings report gave another huge jump in value...this time I turned about $500 into over $7000.

So what else can I do to find stocks to option based on real world events?

EDIT: I know I got lucky here. I said that above. I understand that what happens today or even tomorrow will not have huge effects on stocks. But If we look at the world around us we can make educated guesses about what is going to happen in 3, 6, or even 12 months. I am asking if anyone knows how to apply events in different industries to investment decisions.

15-07-30,3f59g5,2015 is crowdfundings watershed year,"""When new industries are born they either die quickly, snuffled out by growing pains, or they burst into the scene with furious pace.""
The more innovative an idea, the harder it can be to find real adoption. First you need to educate, build within rules, which were often not designed for you and lastly wait for punters to catch on/up and adopt. Crowdfunding is in the middle of this exact process, transitioning from being a clever idea, into a real mechanism for individuals and businesses to raise money. So here are the top 3 reasons why 2015 is proving crowdfunding’s watershed point.

1. UK government support is awesome

Political support for the alternative finance sector has been enduring and constant. The chancellor George Osborne seems super-keen to bring alternative finance into the mainstream. With his post-election Budget, the announcement of the Innovative Finance ISA demonstrates this desire admirably. In fact, with the UK discovering a world-leading niche with the fintech sector, support for new-fangled tech and finance sectors is likely to continue to grow, even potentially through direct government investment. Further tax incentives, changes in the way banks treat failed loan application and greater awareness at the very top, will ensure continued strength in the already rapidly growing industry.

2. The Innovative Finance ISA is a BIG deal

The government recently announced the launch of the Innovative Finance ISA, called by the industry the IFISA, or the far more colloquial crowdISA as we at investUP call it. This will be based on all investment types of crowdfunding (so lending to people, businesses and buying shares). The new ISA will not sit under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). It also recognises that crowdfunding is a set of distinct asset classes, with a unique risk profile. The massiveness of this one really must not be understated. The crowdISA will allow consumers to lend or invest up to £15,240 a year tax free, via either individual crowdfunding sites, or across lots of them, to individuals and businesses. Crowdfunding will suddenly have access to a slice of the £50bn a year of retail money, which goes into the ISA pot. By all accounts this will be a huge transformation within the crowdfunding world, as well as signalling that crowdfunding is going mainstream. Public awareness of crowdfunding will be transformed due to this change. Exciting.

3. Global crowdfunding is continuing to grow massively

Whilst the UK is the most advanced western crowdfunding marketplace, worldwide crowdfunding is catching up. Relatively the US is starting to really pick up the pace. With Nesta.org in Nov 2014 suggested that the 2015 alternative finance market in the UK alone would reach £4.4bn, the global figures are predicted by Massolution to double as well to $34.4bn. The EU is also pushing new boundaries, with crowdfunding developing, although this is still in its infancy. 

What does the future hold for crowdfunding?

Crowdfunding is undergoing huge growth. We at UP expect this to start levelling off by 2020. By this point crowdfunding will be mainstream, with alternative finance really being anything but alternative. As investors understand better the risk profile of the industry, so to will the FCA. Having both parties better understand the losses as well as potential gains one can make will only strengthen the sector. Sites which offer greater portfolio diversification with tools to support this will win. Millennial adoption of the alternative finance mechanisms will ensure that they become the majority retail user. By 2020 crowdfunding will be fully grown UP. #theonlywayisUP",1

On nasdaq.com, they have ""high"" and ""low"" for after hours and pre hours.... but.... it's only available for a few hours, and then it disappears.

Technically... I could write a program to collect it from nasdaq.com while it's still there.... but then, I wouldn't be able to get all the old historical data, and I would have to wait weeks, months etc for new data to come in.

So.... does anyone know where to find archived historical data with highs and lows for after hours and pre hours trading?

15-07-30,3f7uka,How could it REALISTICALLY forecast the brent oil price with such an accuracy?,"Hi everybody,

I've been looking around about infos on this topic for a while here and in other subs. Trying again.

Lurking on the web, I've found a guy claiming to be able forecast with a really good accuracy if the brent oil price will go up or down in the next x H1/M15 bars thanks to deep learning algos.

He sells an indicator (which I won't link even if you request it and which is very expensive) adaptable for basically any platform. My question is about this indicator.

I've seen it and it looks good. I've asked to watch it live through a remote control software called TeamViewer and the guy traded live with it in front of me. I still didn't trust it (maybe a programmer can ""edit"" the video-streaming?) so I just opened my mt4 platform whilst he was streaming the screen and the prices were real, almost the same.

Which -not legit- tricks to predict the market prices could have he been using?

PROJECT SUMMARY

Natural Citrus Ingredients, LLC
 Proposed “Profit Sharing Agreement” with SunOpta (NASDAQ:SKL)

 Our team at Natural Citrus Ingredients, LLC (“NCI”, “We”, “Us”, “Our”) has been engaged for about 4 years in a collaborative relationship with SunOpta, a leading global company focused on organic, non-genetically modified (“non-GMO””) and specialty foods, to develop a profit-sharing agreement to the mutual benefit of both parties.  We have, collectively, invested over $300,000 and 500 hours in this project.  It is about to become a reality.  Our draft agreement is provided as Exhibit 1. 

SunOpta has 1,700 global employees, and their food operations revolve around value-added fruit-based products supported by a global sourcing and supply infrastructure. Through its recent acquisitions of “Lorton’s Fresh Squeezed Juice, Inc.” and “Citrusource LLC” it has established a significant market position in citrus-based products, and is desirous of converting its recovered citrus peel material into high quality, nutritious, food grade ingredient products.

SunOpta expects to annually produce about 50 million pounds of usable citrus peel.  Currently SunOpta’s citrus peel is relegated to “waste material” for use as cattle feed providing about $0.03 net profit per pound.  The profit sharing proposal we will make to SunOpta projects a net profit of $0.33 per pound; an eleven fold increase.  We would, likewise, net a profit of $0.33 per pound.  We believe we have a very real possibility of successfully entering into said “Profit Sharing Agreement”.  

It will take 5 to 14 years to ramp up to where we are processing the entire 50 million pounds.  See Exhibit 2 for a conservative projection of profits using a 14 year time line.  As you can see the Net Profit to SunOpta is quite compelling at $450,000 in the 1st year growing to $15,000,000 in year 14.

This is particularly compelling since we are funding and managing the project.  SunOpta’s contribution consists of (1) the Raw Peel, (2) access to real estate SunOpta is now not using (3) conveyance assistance and, if applicable, (4) certain “piggy-back” rights to certifications already gained by SunOpta.

The “Profit Sharing Agreement” is structured in a simplified manner; revenue less cost equals profit.  

Revenue is defined as the selling price of the finished citrus peel material to a customer, estimated to be an average of $4/lb. (it takes about 4.35 lbs. of raw peel to produce 1 lb. of finished peel). 

Cost is defined as the fully burdened cost per pound required to produce the finished product, estimated to be $0.85 per finished pound.  

Profit is defined as the pre-taxed difference between revenue and cost.  This profit figure is the subject of our profit sharing negotiations whether it be 50/50 as assumed herein or some variation thereof.

 We have the network, personnel, expertise, technology, and ability to be up and running within the year, and simply require a modest $30,000 per month for 3 months in order to keep our team working while we finish negotiations.  Once our agreement with SunOpta is signed, we will raise the rest of the capital needed, about $300,000, to complete the operational facility.  We expect to be producing and selling product by November 2015.  
  
 $$s invested now will be in the form of 1 year convertible notes at 10% interest, interest payable annually.  Said $$s invested will be convertible to equity.  Said notes will be guaranteed by one of our principals, Paul Hackett, of Assurance Architects Insurance Agency, Inc.  Investor(s) at this stage will be first in line to convert their loans into equity in the company and will be offered an enhanced percentage share per invested $$ than will be available to later investors. 

I will be in touch shortly to answer any questions you might have.  Or you can call me at 818.510.1699 or message me here on reddit (cannot include email address on this /r/)

While I do know the topics he brings up are legitimate, I can't seem to convince him that these issues are not ""obviously"" a one way street to total economic collapse.

His reasoning reminds me of people having recently watched that zeitgeist documentary (with no economic background) and spouting about how our monetary system is a sham and central banks are the root of all evil and money enslaves the world etc etc.

I currently am working at cvs pharmacy working as a pharm tech, which doesn't really make too much ($9.45/hour). I will be getting a raise next year when I become an intern, but that is not that important. I currently have around $3000 saved from this summer and will be working about 20 hours a week when I go back to school, so probably $800 a month. Of which I will probably save $600. I am not paying for college so I want that all to go to investments. 

I am new to investing so what kind of advice would you give to a young kid not paying for college who has a capital of $3000 and a monthly contribution of $600. I was thinking a index fund or mutual fund for long term investments, but I want your advice.

It's quite long. so sorry for the wall of text. Just would like your thoughts. 

Fundamental Analysis: 


Qualitative data research 


1.	Understand their business model and how they make money
2.	Management- 


a.	Conference calls- what type of answers do they provide? 


b.	Management Discussion and Analysis- read the last 5 years. Found at the beginning of the Annual report 
c.	Ownership and insider trades- check to see if management is selling their shares or being paid in stock vs cash. Bad sign if selling stock. 


d.	Past performance- check the CEO’s performance in other companies. 


3.	Corporate Governance-


a.	Financial transparency 


b.	How independent is the board of directors of a company?  Or is there an incentive to protect their CEOs? 


4.	The Industry- 


a.	Customers- how large is their customer base? Or small? Will they continue to get customers? 


b.	Market share- what’s it’s present market share, this could help to sway the industry in their favor, if big enough. 


c.Industry Growth- Will the industry continue to grow? Or will companies need to steal customers from their competitors to keep it up. 

d.	Competition- Higher # of competitors? How much pricing power does the firm of interest have?  


e.	Regulations of the industry- will a small change in regulation greater affect the bottom line of this business? 


Qualitative data research 


1.	Balance Sheet- 


a.	Assets= Liabilities+ shareholders/equity 


b.	Assets-


i.	Current assets- Assets that will likely be turned into cash within a year. (Cash, Inventories, and accounts receivable). 


1.	A growing cash reserve is often good. However, if it’s a long-term trend it could mean poor management. 


ii.	Inventory turnover- how quickly a company moves their product to the consumer. If it grows quicker than sales this is bad.

 
iii.	Receivables- uncollected debts


1.	A long collection period is might be bad. They might be trying to increase sales through manipulation of their finances. 


iv.	Current liabilities- debts, which must be paid within a year. 


1.	Companies with higher assets than debts are in decent shape.

 
2.	Look for quick ratio or Current assets-inventories/ current liabilities=QR. The Quick Ratio tells you if the company has enough money to cover their short term debts and obligations.  


v.	Equity- represents what the shareholders own. 


1.	Retained earnings- the amount of money companies chose to reinvest rather than give to their shareholders. 


a.	Look at how much return they get for their re-investment. 

2.	Income statement- snapshot of the company’s performance over a period of time. 


a.	Look for continued growth in their revenue


b.	Expenses that are decreasing is a good sign, unless it’s R&amp;D in a drug company. 


c.	High gross margins or money left over after the cost of sales. Good if this is increasing. Also good if it’s higher than their competition. They’re less likely to go into bankruptcy during a recession. 


d.	Net Income- What most people refer to as profits. 


3.	Cash flow- Hard to fake cash, some think it’s a better conservative estimate of company performance


a.	Positive cash from operating is good


b.	Watch for a big gap in reported earnings and cash from operating. 


c.	Cash flow from investing- 


i.	Firms should re-invest the amount of deprecation each year.

 
d.	Cash flow from financing-  Bank borrowing, sale of stock, and bonds. 


e.	most investors like the company to be able to pay for it’s own investments. Thus free flow cash is important. The calculation is: Net income +Amortization/depreciation- changes in working capital- capital expenditures= free cash flow.   


Where to find stuff 


Generally most of this is found on the company’s website. 


4.	Balance sheet, Income statement, and Cash flow statement can be found in the 10-Q and 10-K. More quantitative data can be found in the MD&amp;A  (management discussion and Analysis).


a.	10-K- discloses business performance over the year


b.	10-Q- discloses performance at each quarter


5.	Auditor’s report- Independent CPA firm looks at the company and decides if their financials are trust worthy or not.   


6.	Foot Notes- 
a.	Accounting methods- watch out if they change it up often. Could be a sign of attempting to hide bad finances.


b.	Disclosure- other stuff that was left out to keep things clean in the reports. These are worth a look.

The format is kind of fucked but hopefully it's still readable. So I would like some thoughts. Do you think i shouldn't put what to look for in it? Should I let him draw his own conclusions? Is there something huge I left out? Thanks!

Would love it to be a site that talked about lesser know companies since Apple, Amazon, Google, eBay, Tesla, GoPro, etc, are pretty well covered already.

I've discussed this with u/SmexySwede and u/a_guy_with_a_plan and we are thinking it could be a site where we focus on 1 goal:

* intelligent discussion on one stock each day
* talk fundamentals and technicals
* preferably a large enough company that lots of us would consider investing in it (i.e. rarely a small cap or penny stock)

Also thinking:

* no downvoting, just upvoting
* the choice of the stock of the day being moderated / not a free for all

What do you think? Is there a demand for a new sub-reddit along these lines? How would you approach this?

15-07-31,3f8qwl,"I'm 21 and here is what I am doing so far...","So when I turned 18 I opened an Edward Jones account and met with a local associate and started a mutual fund (MFS Growth Allocation Fund Class A). I've been putting away $150 every month into this account since I turned 18 and it was done pretty well. (Enough to make me happy!) Invest roughly $5,400 so far, and it's worth about $6,130 currently.

However, I have had $10,000 in cash sitting in a Money Market account at a local credit union getting about .37% interest monthly ($3.10 roughly every month) and this is decent for passive money but when you take into account inflation I think I am POTENTIALLY losing money with this option.

That being said, I was pondering if I should take out around $5,000 from this Money Market account and invest in another mutual fund. I'm much more fond of mutual funds. That's what my risk tolerance would be.( I've tried individual stock via Motif Investing and I think I will wait until I have more disposable income to play around that some more. )

My question(s) would be should I add another mutual fund with the $5,000 and invest regularly into it as well, or should I dump it all into my current mutual fund? I know this should probably seem like a no-brainer question but I don't know what would be more worth it in the long run. Watching two different mutual funds or just worrying about one.

Other options could include increasing how much I am contributing monthly to my current one, ect.


Other facts about me are that I am going to college year round but my parents are able to foot the bill for me. I do have a job and I can probably make about $500 a month (it's just a silly campus job, but it is nice to have some income) and that doesn't have to go toward any big bills so I am somewhat free to do with it as I want.

15-07-30,3f614m,Has Mike Tyson Lent His Name to a Micro-Cap Scam Artist?,"www.StockPromoters.com

News broke this week that former heavy-weight champ Mike Tyson is getting into the Bitcoin ATM business.  But some sources claim that the champ may have been scammed. According to various outlets, Mike Tyson Bitcoin ATM will offer cash-to-Bitcoin conversion in less than 20 seconds, and will debut in August. That’s pretty much the extent of what is known at this time, except that Tyson has confirmed the business deal with a tweet and the website is up and running at miketysonbitcoin.com.

It seems like a pretty cool proposition, so what’s the problem? Well, an investigation has found that the domain name is registered to one Peter Klamka. Mr. Klamka is the CEO of a micro-cap company called Bitcoin Brands, Inc. (PINK: CEHC). The company bio states that:

“Bitcoin Brands Inc. is a developer and marketer of mobile applications. The Company also has an interest in a social media company, which is focused on the fashion industry. It is developing applications for the iPhone platform. It has two subsidiaries, Legend Credit Inc and Legend Studios Inc. The Company has an application on the iTunes store called The Iron Sheik Soundboard. It also distributes free of charge an iPhone application called MMAUnderboss, which is a collection of newswires covering the sport of mixed martial arts. It also markets on iTunes free of charge a music themed application called Metal RSS. This application is a collection of newsfeeds targeted at music fans”

Really? What has this got to do with bitcoins? Plus, none of this info can be verified.

The problem is that Klamka’s company has no visible offerings and it is extremely difficult to find out anything at all about the company which has a market cap of only $6,780. Klamka claims that his company offers a site called Bitcoin for Miles (a site to buy airline frequent flyer miles) and something called the “Bitcoin Vending Network,” which makes a lot of claims, talking about offering ATM services on one hand, then vending machines on the other. The other service the company alleges to provide is BitMD, claimed to provide Bitcoin payment services to the medical marijuana industry.
 
There is just no evidence that CEHC offers either of these services, other than its own press releases. And if it really did offer them, the market cap would tend to be higher, one would conclude. The problem is that aside from a dismal market cap, CEHC has no substantiated proof of ANY ATM grand openings, no photos, no promo pieces on the success, or lack thereof of the ventures. Red flags?
 
At least share price of the company should reflect some movement. It’s remained stagnant at $0.00010 for ages.
 
Meanwhile, Klamka strongly refutes the allegations. Under the condition they would not be shared, he supplied three images of the branded ATMs, one showing the Vegas skyline, which he maintained were ready to be launched at any time. Additionally, he said that Tyson has an ""even split"" of equity due to the way the license is structured.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin Brands – which Klamka maintains is not affiliated with his work with Tyson – currently operates two ATMs, one in New York and another in Montreal.
 
The company has links to another OTC traded company, beef supplier Conexus Cattle Corp. (OTCMKTS: CNXS). However, Klamka maintains that is where the relationship ends. ""They are a financing partner ... maybe tomorrow it will be a different entity, maybe not,"" he said. CNXS has a market cap of $13,380.
 
The reason why the company has no online presence, Klamka said, was due to the fact it had been set up purely for ""celebrity bitcoin licensing"" opportunities. He pointed to various celebrity deals he had made in the past, including a KISS-branded visa card and a Hello Kitty pre-paid debit and credit card. 
 
But, Googling Klamka’s name yields shady results: the first is a bizarre website with equally bizarre comments that appear to be written by someone very defensive of Peter Klamka. The second result is a court brief stemming from his failure to pay child support.
 
It’ll be interesting to see how this newest Tyson venture pans out. Maybe Tyson really is interested in proactive financial planning; you know, especially after he blew over $4 million. Stranger things have happened. You go Mike. ",2

My main note is that with new management in place now, they are looking at spending cash to acquire new companies (of which prior management never did).

If new management reinstates the dividend we will see at least 100% gains in stock price.

Could be easy profit for some of you guys when it decides to get pumped. No position in the stock nor do I really care for it. Just posting that since it is low at this moment, might be worth gambling. Use DD and again, when it comes to stocks like this, you're not investing, you're gambling.

On another note, surprised I haven't seen anybody post AMDA here. They've been going up and down pivoting around the .54 mark. I took advantage of the after hours news that plummetted the stock from .77 to .46. Got in after hours, got out the next morning. Quick and easy.

I currently have a small position in TWTR, they dropped 14% yesterday and has been on a steady decline. TWTR isn't a penny stock but since they have changed CEO's and there's plenty of rumors, i repeat RUMORS (NO SOLID PROOF) of FB buying out it might be worth holding for a while. I've personally been going off ""Buy on the fear, sell on news"" it's been okay so far.

15-07-31,3f9ast,What are Options,"Options are complex financial instruments. There are 2 types of options:

Call options, the equivalent of buying stock (betting that prices will go up).
Put options, the equivalent of shorting stock (betting that prices will go down).
A call option gives you the right but not the obligation to buy a stock in the future at today’s price. However, in order to buy this right the purchaser of a call option needs to pay a premium. Here’s an example. Let’s say Apple stock is currently at $500 a share. If I buy a call option on Apple, I will pay a $50 premium for the right to buy Apple stock at today’s price before December 31, 2013. If Apple stock closes above $550 (500+50) before December 31, 2013, I just made a profit (the difference between the future stock price and today’s price+premium). However, if the stock price does not reach at least $550, I will lose money.

Thus, an option is assymetric. Your losses are limited to the premium you pay, but the potential profits are unlimited.

A put option is exactly the opposite. It gives you the right but not the obligation to sell (short) a stock in the future at today’s price. Likewise, you must pay a premium. Using the same example (but with a put option), let’s say that Apple’s stock is at $500, and I pay a $50 premium to sell Apple’s stock at today’s price before December 31, 2013. If Apple stock closes below $450 (500-50) before December 31, I will make money. However, if the stock does not fall by at least $50, I will lose money. Like a call option, a put option is also assymetric.

Relative Directional Investment
Investing in a stock or an ETF is a purely directional investment. You are betting on the direction of the stock or ETF’s price (up or down).

An options is different. It’s a relative directional investment. I’ll explain what that means.

In a relative direction investment, all three requirements must be met in order to make money.

The market must move in your favorable direction. For example, if you bought a call option, the market needs to go up in order for you to make money.
The market must move in your favorable direction by a minimum amount determined by the premium. If you bought a call option and paid a $50 premium, the market must go up by at least $50. If it goes up by only $30, you just lost $20.
The market must move in your favorable direction by a minimum amount before a certain date.
Options are Insanely Volatile
Options are a very volatile market. You can make a ton of money in a jiffy, but you can also lose your shirt even faster. Here’s an example.

Using the same Apple stock, let’s say you have $500 in your investment account. Apple stock is trading at $500 a share right now. Below are two scenarios.

You outright buy 1 share of Apple stock for $500.
You buy 10 call options that each has a $50 premium. These options expire on December 31 2013.
Let’s assume that Apple stock rose to $600 before December 31 2013. If you had outright bought 1 share of Apple, you would have made $100. That’s a 20% profit. If you had bought 10 call options, you would have made $50 on each option, with a total profit of $500 (10×50). That’s a profit of 100%!

On the other hand, let’s say Apple stock fell to $450 before December 31 2013. If you had bought 1 share of Apple, you lost $50, or 10%. If you had bought 10 call options, those call options would expire worthless. In other words, you just lost 100% of your money.

I have some friends who don’t spend a lot of time monitoring their investments, and I cringe when they talk about their options investments. Needless to say, they’ve lost a lot of money.",1

15-07-30,3f6bmx,Following the bouncing market: a progress report...,"From this **[LINK THIS MORNING](https://thegodoftrading.wordpress.com/2015/07/29/following-the-bouncing-market-a-progress-report/)**:

The market bounce suggested in this link — **[What goes down too far too fast bounces](https://thegodoftrading.wordpress.com/2015/07/26/what-goes-down-too-far-too-fast-bounces/)** — two days ago, a market-timing buy signal for yesterday’s open is currently playing out profitably as the general market has continued up for the second day in a row.

The Nasqaq Comp has rallied 72 points since the bounce call two days ago.

So far the 3xLeveraged ETFs mentioned: TQQQ is up 2.1 percent, UPRO up 4 percent, TNA up 2.5 percent, the leader SOXL up 5.1 percent; and notably, a steady leader all this year, BIB is flat so far on this swing.

Among the top stocks ORCL is up 2.5 percent, AMGN up 3.2 percent, GILD up 2.8 percent; and notably, perennial leader, AAPL is not participating so far in the bounce and is flat.

For options plays: the QQQ August 110 in the money call is up 20.5 percent and the SPY August 207 in the money call is up 46 percent.

The time nears to tighten stops or take some profits on this bounce but the next question will be can it morph into a full-fledged rally?

An intraday update: With the indexes knocking on yesterday's high despite the earlier sell down today, this swing trade is at a crucial point -- i.e. it crosses the highs, the likely answer to the question above is a full-fledged rally, if not, then not...

**Another update (Day 4 of the bounce (Thursday's close):**

Fairly positive day in the market. TQQQ is now up 4 percent on this swing, UPRO up 5.1 percent, TNA up 2.8 percent, SOXL up 6.8, and BIB up 2.1 percent. As for the stocks mentioned above ORCL dipped to 2.3 percent but AMGN moved up another 2.3 percent today and GILD, 2.1 percent. AAPL is still flat; if it doesn't play catchup tomorrow, I have more on that later.  Futures (NQs up 26pts) and call options again had a decent advance for the day.

Almost needless to say, this has been a good week for the bounce call above but it's getting a bit extended. So again, as a swing trader, I am taking profits and tightening stops to lock gains for this swing but that's just me.

Shares in Uranium Energy Corp. (NYSEMKT: UEC) gapped slightly higher at the opening bell of today’s trading despite the fact that the company is facing litigation by multiple boutique law firms.

UEC is a Canada-based uranium exploration company. The company is engaged in uranium mining and related activities, including exploration, pre-extraction, extraction and processing, on uranium projects located in the United States and Paraguay. 

According to the complaints filed on behalf of purchasers of Uranium Energy Corp. common shares between October 14, 2014 and June 17, 2015, the defendants violated Federal Securities Laws. More specifically, the plaintiffs claim that between October 14, 2014 and June 17, 2015, the defendants made allegedly false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that Uranium Energy Corp. stock achieved an unsustainable valuation by using paid stock promoters, yet failed to disclose the use of such promoters in its regulatory filings pursuant to Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, and that as a result of the foregoing, Uranium Energy Corp’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On June 18, 2015, an article published by TheStreetSweeper.org reported that Uranium Energy was using undisclosed paid stock promoters to increase the value of Uranium Energy shares. According to a report by hotstocked.com, quoted in the article above, Uranium Energy has caused to be published at least eight separate stock promotions, for which the company, or third parties controlled by the company, paid over $200,000. 

Some of the stock promotion campaigns, from promoters named “LightningStockPicks,” “Micro Stock Profit,” “InvestorSoup.com,” “The Penny Stocks Finder,” “Stock Preacher,” and “Future Money Trends” include headlines such as: “Chart Is Glowing Green! (UEC) #1 NYSE Play Today,” “UEC Just Hit Critical Mass,” and “(UEC) #1 NYSE Play Today.”
 
On the following day, the Company issued a press release denying the allegations and stating that the article published by TheStreetSweeper.org had no merit. However, the article did not address the allegations related to the undisclosed paid stock promotions and market was unconvinced.

As a result of this news, shares of Uranium Energy declined, dropping $0.62 or over 25.6 percent on unusually heavy volume, to as close at $1.80 on June 19, 2015. Over two trading days, shares fell $0.80 or over 30.7 percent.

UEC has a market cap of $130.7 million and is trading at $1.36 today. Shares have a 52-week high of $3.00 and a low of $1.02. ",3

15-07-30,3f6phy,$PER. Sandridge permian trust. Fraught with danger,"On the outset, they have been giving away stable dividends, the last 4 dividends were 63c, 66c , 66c and 64c. Div yield on finance websites is around 35%. Of course thats past performance. The next few quarters is going to be a downslide towards the abyss.  Here are my points from their 10k and 10-qs
1) Their last quarter earnings was around 13million, with all their 888 wells completed. 
2) They have only one month of deriviatives locked in (for month of March production) and have sold all their derivatives
3) Shale wells produce 75% of oil in the first year and around 90% in the first 2-3 years based on their oil recoveries from the ground.
4) Sandridge does not really have a financial incentive. Their share of dividends is not going to accure to them based on the incentive plan.
5) Dilution at the end of the year with another 13 million of sandridge being added to the 39.5 million existing shares. Earnings decline while shares outstanding increases.
6) Trust worth 400 mil is a travesty. In my opinion it should be worth around 100 mil. (1/4th of the present value) 
7) Trust is going to be liquidated if earnings are less than or equal to 5 mil for 4 consecutive quarters. My prediction is in 2016 its going to be liquidated.
8) Cannot make money shorting shares or buying put options. Bid ask price spread is too high. Borrowing shares is expensive. 
9) Looking forward to see if my predictions turn out right.

15-07-31,3falft,A closer look at $VZ,"Verizon (NYSE:[VZ](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=vz&amp;fr=uh3_finance_web&amp;uhb=uhb2)) released its [second-quarter](http://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-delivers-double-digit-adjusted-earnings-growth-strong-cash-flows-2q-2015) results July 21. The firm reported earnings per share of $1.04, compared to $1.01 in the second quarter of 2015. It grew total revenues by 5.3% on a year-over-year basis, and cash flow from operations jumped to $18.9 million in the first half of 2015, from $14.8 billion in the first half of 2014. Excluding results from recent acquisitions, Verizon expects revenue growth of 3% in the full year of 2015.

In early 2014, Verizon [purchased](http://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-completes-acquisition-vodafones-45-percent-indirect-interest-verizon-wireless) the remaining 45% stake in its wireless operating segment from Vodafone Group (NASDAQ:[VOC](http://finance.yahoo.com/q;_ylt=AnvXHJR8omHae3sjnQXhuv6qgfME?uhb=uhb2&amp;fr=uh3_finance_vert_gs&amp;type=2button&amp;s=voc)) for ~$130 billion. Though this has forced Verizon to take on nearly $100 billion in debt, management is confident that the deal is the right move for the future growth of the firm. It now has full ownership of the US wireless industry leader in network performance, profitability, and cash flow, but a disciplined approach to capital spending will be necessary moving forward.

In recent news, Verizon also moved to [acquire](http://www.wirelessweek.com/news/2015/06/it-closes-aol-deal-verizon-teases-new-video-service) AOL for ~$4.4 billion as part of its efforts to expand into mobile video and advertising. The firm believes that mobile will represent 80% of consumers' media consumption in the coming years, and we tend to agree. But AOL may not be the best way to do it. In any case, Verizon wants to provide an online TV subscription that will let users stream sports and other media content on their handheld platforms.

We like Verizon's potential, and its dividend is going to turn a lot of heads. However, its debt load could eventually weigh on shares as the economic recovery ages and consumer credit weakens. Let's dig deeper into some of Verizon's other investment considerations and derive a fair value estimate for the company.

**Investment Highlights**

• Verizon offers broadband, video and other wireless and wireline services to consumers, businesses, governments and wholesale customers. The firm operates one of America's fastest 4G wireless networks and provides services over one of America's most advanced fiber-optic networks.

• Verizon has a good combination of strong free cash flow generation and manageable financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 12.3% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 3.1 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 90.2%.

• Verizon's focus on margin expansion and profitable growth is undeniable. It's hard not to like the firm's ~50% wireless segment EBITDA service margins, and amazingly, about one-third of its customers still don't have smartphones. This offers headroom to capitalize on the migration to tablets and other devices.

• We continue to evaluate Verizon for addition to the portfolio of the Dividend Growth Newsletter, though we note its acquisition of the portion of Verizon Wireless it did not already own has complicated matters (given the outsize debt load it has taken on).

**Economic Profit Analysis**

From our point of view, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Verizon's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 6%, which is below the estimate of its cost of capital of 8.9%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of POOR.

**Cash Flow Analysis**

Firms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Verizon's free cash flow margin has averaged about 12.7% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG.

The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Verizon, cash flow from operations decreased about 3% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 13% over the same time period.

Verizon reported $8.4 billion in free cash flow in the first half of 2015.

**Valuation Analysis**

This is the most important portion of our analysis. Below we connect our valuation assumptions that drive our discounted cash flow model, so let's dial it up and derive a fair value estimate for shares.

Our discounted cash flow model indicates that Verizon's shares are worth between $40-$60 each. Shares are currently trading at ~$47 per share, in the bottom half of our fair value range. This indicates that we feel there is more upside potential than downside risk associated with shares at this price.

The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's LOW ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $50 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 20.7 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 8.4 times last year's EBITDA.

Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 2.1% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 4.7%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 21.4%, which is above Verizon's trailing 3-year average.

Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 3.3% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Verizon, we use a 8.9% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.

**Margin of Safety Analysis**

Each fair value estimate we provide comes with a margin of safety, within which we feel the company is fairly valued. Our discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $50 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.

Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock.  We think the firm is attractive below $40 per share, but quite expensive above $60 per share. 

**Wrapping Things Up**

We think there is a lot to like about Verizon, especially after it took full ownership of its Verizon wireless network, the crown jewel of the wireless industry.

However, the massive debt load it had to take on to acquire the network will require a very disciplined approach to capital spending moving forward. We also like its plans to start a TV subscription of sorts, but it is still too early to judge the true potential of the project. AOL's advertisement capabilities will be necessary in helping with operating costs, considering the firm's debt load.

All in, we continue to watch Verizon from the sidelines. We tend to be debt-averse, but the company's debt load is sizable by almost any standard. Our biggest concern will be the performance of EBITDA and how the company's leverage metrics map out during the next recession, the timing of which is only uncertain.

15-07-31,3faqof,Question about FINRA regs,"So the wife works for a financial planning branch of a major bank.  There are only 3 or 4 people at the branch, so it's not a major part of the organization.  They are claiming that FINRA regs and their own policies require that all of my brokerage accounts (even my Roth IRA that only holds mutual funds) be with them so they can keep an eye on my money to make sure we aren't in financial trouble or making risky decisions or something.  This wouldn't be so bad if not for 2 things: 1) their fees are the highest I have ever seen, by a very very large margin.  I do basic options trading and long-term investing, and close to 30% of my profits are taken by their fees, vs an estimated 3-5% for someone like TD.  2) they're extremely restrictive in what I'm allowed to do.  I can't trade any option strategies besides buying premium or selling covered calls.  Can't short stock.  Their definition of ""penny stock"" is much stricter than any other I've seen.

.

So my question is this:  What are the exact FINRA regs that they could be claiming to keep me there?

.

I've asked them to provide me the exact regs/policies, and they keep giving me vague answers with no concrete proof.  Do the regs say that I must have my accounts with them, or only that I provide them with monthly statements and sufficient oversight?  Can they legally enforce their company policies on me since I'm not an employee?  Can they fire or reprimand my wife if I don't comply with their company policies, since I'm not an employee?

15-07-31,3favae,Upstate New York Fraud Scheme Busted,"www.StockPromoters.com

Yesterday, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged two men and eight companies with defrauding investors, many of them upstate New York residents, who purchased the companies’ securities and so-called “charitable gift annuities.” 

According to the SEC’s complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Syracuse, New York, the alleged scheme raised at least $8 million from 125 or more investors in shares and promissory notes issued by the companies over more than seven years, starting in 2007. 

The complaint names James P. Griffin, the founder and CEO of 54Freedom Inc., both of Cazenovia, New York, and James Wolle, 54Freedom’s Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.  Six other Cazenovia, New York-based firms, 54Freedom Securities Inc., MoneyIns Inc., 54Freedom Foundation Inc., 5 Ledyard Ave. LLC, 5 Ledyard Corp., IICNet LLC, and Miami-based 54FreedomTele Inc. also were named in the complaint. 

Griffin used at least $1.2 million of the money for his own use – to pay his and his wife's credit cards bills and to buy, among other items, ""a large boat, expensive vacations, luxury cars, expensive clothing and jewelry and country club memberships,"" the complaint alleges.
Griffin, 70, was indicted last week on eight counts of wire fraud, five counts of mail fraud and five counts of money laundering. He is accused of defrauding 10 to 11 investors of $1.6 million.

The SEC’s complaint alleges that Griffin and Wolle repeatedly misled prospective investors regarding the companies’ prospects, for instance, falsely claiming that they had an exclusive relationship with Lloyd’s of London and that they would publish a soccer book affiliated with the “Chicken Soup for the Soul” series.  

In addition, Griffin is alleged to have sold purported “charitable gift annuities” that he falsely claimed were backed by reputable insurance companies and to have diverted at least $1.2 million of investor funds to pay for corporate and personal expenses, including a boat and trips he and his wife took to Hawaii and New Zealand.

“We allege that Griffin and Wolle picked numbers out of thin air and even guaranteed projections to purchasers of the securities while taking undisclosed sums for themselves,” said Andrew M. Calamari, Director of the SEC’s New York Regional Office.

The SEC’s complaint charges Griffin, Wolle and the eight companies with violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the securities laws and names Griffin’s wife, Chary Griffin, as a relief defendant for the purpose of recovering allegedly misappropriated investor funds.",2

Petro America Corp. owner Isreal Owen Hawkins, 60, of Kansas City, Kansas, was convicted in May 2013 of conspiracy, securities fraud, aggravated currency structuring, money laundering and two counts of wire fraud and was sentenced to 30 years in prison without parole. Four other top leaders in Hawkins' Missouri-based company — Teresa Brown, Johnny Heurung, William Miller and Martin Roper — were convicted of conspiracy to commit fraud.

All five were involved in the company, founded in 2007 by Hawkins, purported to be an oil and mining operation that Hawkins claimed to be worth $284 billion, but the feds said had no worth. They were accused of selling over $7 million worth of unregistered stock, targeting poor investors who could ill afford the investment.

On Wednesday, a federal appeals court panel upheld the convictions of the five for bilking mostly poor investors out of millions of dollars with promises that they could become wealthy beyond their wildest dreams by spending as little as $100.

""In sum, the government's evidence overwhelmingly established that Petro America was a sham entity that had no real value and that Hawkins, along with several of his coconspirators, used the company as a vehicle to dupe thousands of unwitting investors out of millions of dollars,"" the court wrote.

The company recruited investors through churches, whose pastors promoted Petro as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to ""share the blessing."" Hawkins and his cohorts pushed the stock at a cost of $100 per 100,000 shares, promising them that ""book value"" of the stock would be $2 per share when the company went public.

During his trial, Hawkins told jurors the company was legitimate and that the only reason it didn't go public was because the federal government wanted to destroy it.

For now, all five will remain in prison. ",3

A financial advisor presented me with the idea of taking a HELOC on my condo and investing this into safe, dividend-paying stocks. I ended up not using the financial advisor's services and have not been in contact, but I'd still like to look into this idea more. My problems are that I don't quite understand how to find a safe dividend-paying stock whose dividends will suffice to pay off the loan (which I believe I can get from somewhere between 3 and 4%) - I'm new to the stock market; I'm also not sure whether to take the stock's increasing value into consideration; and I also don't understand how taxes on all this works. And then there's inflation. Would this move even be worth it?

-Just invested $300,000 in a Vanguard MF portfolio 
-Have a cushion of $50,000 and a fairly safe income for the next 1-3 years 
-Am looking for ways to safely leverage home equity

15-07-31,3fb6ud,NFLX: Some Things to Consider,"PE is not really the best measure for a growth company like Netflix. I mean, would a 200 PE be better?  Or a 150 PE? It's a meaningless number if you can't predict the growth rate. 

Looking at the membership numbers from their annual report, it looks like the growth rates are falling fast. Domestic streamers grew 17% in 2014 vs 23% in 2013. International streamers grew 67% in 2014 vs 73% in 2013. Domestic dvd'ers are on a decline, making total domestic memberships growth rate 11% in 2014 vs 14% in 2013.

So you have to guess where and when these growth rates converge. Which Im convinced is impossible in all but the most broad sense, but that's just me. 

Then you have to figure out the revenue per member. Which is easy. The nice thing is that as the membership growth rates slow down, the revenue per member actually goes up. This may seem counter-intuitive, but it's because new members don't pay for a full year of service. Also, Netflix inflates it's membership numbers by including those on free trials. (I can't find how many trials actually convert to paying memberships, but Im guessing it's high.)

Then you have to look at their fixed costs growth rate and their variable costs. What makes Netflix attractive is the variable cost per member is likely negligible for streamers. 

My main concern with Netflix is their fixed costs, because they have no competitive advantage that I can see. Anyone with enough capital can work out contracts with media companies and start streaming content for a monthly subscription. As more competitors enter the space, you'll see increased costs as bidding wars break out for content. Original content is a differentiator, but if every provider has their own original content then it becomes a matter of customer preference. 

The only defense I've heard is that it hasn't happened yet. Amazon is trying (unsuccessfully apparently) and Google and Apple are seemingly content to stick to a PPV model. But bumbling competitors isn't a competitive advantage in the long run.

Case in point, Hulu is a joint venture between NBC, FOX, and ABC. So far it's a dumpster fire. It only has 4 million subs compared to Netflix's 64 million. http://www.statisticbrain.com/hulu-statistics/ But what concerns me about Hulu is what it represents. In the future, Netflix may start seeing real competition from its suppliers. Or maybe they'll continue to play nice. I have no idea. But it's just something for you to consider.

15-07-31,3fbhhx,Bank of San Francisco - Potential Investment Opportunity,"I believe that this is a good place to post this and I don't see any rules prohibiting it, but let me know if I am wrong. 

I will also state that neither I nor anyone I know would benefit from this but it seems like a very good investment opportunity. Below is the spiel, as you might say, for the investment opportunity from one of the original board members. 

""Many banks have not done well over the past few years, especially small banks. The  costs of Dodd Frank are significant. However, some small banks are making money, including the one I am writing you about. And, some smart money is now getting into banks, especially in mergers and acquisitions. While small banks trade about book value, profitable banks with a billion+ in assets are starting to be acquired at 150% to 200% of book value. There have been 2 transactions in the Bay Area in the last 6 months of such banks (Mechanics Bank and Bridge Bank), one at 167% book value and the other at 200% book value. Both banks were much bigger than the bank I am involved with, and both were profitable, although the 167% one had issues. In that case, the acquiring entity was a fund that has announced its intention to acquire more banks in this market.

The bank I am involved with is Bank of San Francisco.  It opened in 2005 and I was one of the founding directors.  We are raising $8,000,000 in this capital raise; we raised $9,000,000 4 yrs ago.


Here are the key reasons I am high on Bank of San Francisco: 


1.  The Bank has a proven track record, and this record was made during a tough period for banks.


2.  The Bank has been consistently profitable, making over $1,000,000 in profits in each of the last 3 years. It has been profitable every year since it opened in 2005 except for the first 2 1/2  start up years.


3.  The Bank has very few problem loans. Since 2005, we have written off only $629,600 in bad loans.  Although I don't know the exact amount of loans made, I believe the Bank has made at least $300,000,000 in loans in the last 10 years; we currently have $166,000,000 in outstanding loans now. Notwithstanding our low loan losses, we have over $2,000,000 in loan loss reserves.


4.  The Bank is located in one of the strongest markets in the Country which should provide good opportunities going forward.


5. The offering price for this capital raising transaction is $15.75 per share, which is 22% higher than the $12.95 price at which shares were sold in the Bank's 2011 offering and 57% higher than the $10.00 price  at which shares were sold in the Bank's initial offering in 2005.


6.  The Bank has a plan to grow from $189,000,000 in assets (6/30/15) to $500,000,000 in 5 years. This is very important. Well run bigger banks are more valuable than well run smaller banks. The $15.75 share price is 116% of book value. If Bof SF were a ""half a billion dollar bank"" now, the ""multiple"" probably would be close to 150%.  So, by growing the bank, not only will the stock value increase through reinvested profits, but the multiple should also increase.  Of course, this is an historical analysis and not a certainty, as market conditions do change.  The market today is lower than it was 5 years ago, but it appears to be improving. Dodd Frank has made it very hard for small banks to be profitable, as size is needed to absorb the cost.


7. Twenty five percent of the currently outstanding stock is owned by directors and employees who purchased their shares on the same terms and conditions as all other shareholders. Thus, the Bank is governed and run by people whose goals are exactly aligned with investors.  


Bof SF stock is not for everyone. The Bank does not intend to distribute dividends over the next few years, and the stock is not traded on any exchange. This may change in the future, but for now staff finds buyers for shareholders who wish to sell. This offering is best looked at as a long term investment (5+/- years)""

I was told that the earnings for this past quarter were better than expected as well. I am curious what the investors of this community think about this opportunity. The minimum purchase is just over $15k.

15-07-31,3fbrr3,Exxon Mobil Reports Dismal Q2 2015 Earnings: Time to Buy?,"[Yahoo! Finance News Article](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/exxonmobil-earns-4-2-billion-120000010.html)

Exxon Mobil just reported its second quarter earnings for the 2015 fiscal year at $1.00 per share. This is down from $1.17 in Q1 and $2.17 in Q2 2014. The stock is down greater than 4.5% today.

As a value investor, I'm starting to sense that this stock is starting to look more like a buying opportunity. Here is my reasoning:

1. The current forward P/E based on this quarter's earnings and today's price is ~20. This isn't astronomical. Much of this is likely due to oil hanging around $50 per barrel. If long term oil prices rise, then one could expect XOM earnings to more closely resemble Q1 2015 or Q4 2014. This would give you EPS and P/E values of 17/$1.17 and 13/$1.56, respectively, at today's price. XOM has also been cost cutting, so earnings could even improve on those numbers.

2. XOM has twice as many assets as liabilities and a debt to shareholder equity ratio of 1/5. Their books seem pretty strong to me and this is reinforced by my third point.

3. XOM increased its dividend to $0.73 per quarter ($2.92 annually), showing that the leaders have confidence in their future cash flow. Dividend yield is now 3.5%. I think that's pretty good considering the alternatives out there.

I see limited downside to the company other than oil could stay around $50 per barrel or go even lower. But even if it did, I think XOM is in a much stronger position to withstand any further drops than most, if not all, other oil companies out there and would still be a good investment.

What do you all think? It seems like a great value play to me for someone investing a long term time horizon.

Edit: Had debt to shareholder equity flipped around. (Was 5, is 1/5.)",3

I have no prior experience in businesses. but everyone around me thinks i have the brain and skills for it. 

all i see is that **I understand how people work and i can influence them to do what i want, and i can persuade them toward the ways i see fit.**



I'm from Iraq-Kurdistan. for the last two years I've been giving some pointers and tips to my friend on his businesses (He's a General salesman)

a week ago he came to me and told me that he's gonna invest 300K dollars in me and wants me to start off a successful business for him, I'll be getting 50% of the income. he trusts me enough to invest the money where i tell him to, even if it fails he has a 'At least we tried' mindset.

_______

The risk is small, and the profit seems big if done in the right way, i have a few ideas on what businesses to start but wanted to take you guys's input on the subject.

###You Should Know: Iraq/Kurdistan is nothing like it's televised, I'm in a city with lots of successful businesses, away from terror and we operate our daily life's just like any other city.

##Iraq has Lots of potential for new businesses, the city only has General purpose companies like Cellular phone service, Internet Providers, Credit card offices, and other general companies, **There's lots of space and room that we can take advantage of in the city/Country.** 

______

###**My Ideas:** 

* Start a professional photography office, with nice enough advertisement and quality to pull people in. *[This will require a small office, High grade photography equipment and a talented Eye]*

* To make a summer camp for all the high class people to go to.* [This will include buying or renting a land, Buying lots of equipment and studying summer camps around the world, taking most of the good elements and implement it in our summer camp. it will require a large scale of advertising too]*
______
**My Questions:**

* What are the questions i should be asking, but haven't yet?

* What is the best thing to do in my situation: Invest or leave the whole thing?

* What are the best businesses i could start?

* As i mentioned before there are lots of main services that we still don't provide, can you name some that might be interesting to people?

* The best thing about this city is that everyone copies the other, in hopes of higher value, what is the best way to put this into action? And what kind of businesses takes advantage of that?
