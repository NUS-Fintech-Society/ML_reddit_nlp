15-08-01,3fdxr7,"Worker Pay in U.S. Rises 0.2%, Smallest Gain Since 1982","For anyone drinking up that ""economy is getting better!"" kool-aid. Here's a hint, it isn't. UE figures mean jack without considering overall aggregate workforce numbers *AND* wages. As an extreme example, if you employ the entire country for 10$/hour, you're not doing better even though you have full employment.

Fat chance the Fed will raise rates anymore than just a token rate increase this year (so they can quickly slam it back it down the second things get sketchy).

-------------
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-31/worker-pay-in-u-s-rises-0-2-smallest-gain-in-records-to-1982

Wages and salaries in the U.S. rose in the second quarter at the slowest pace on record, dashing projections that an improving labor market would boost pay.

The 0.2 percent advance was the smallest since records began in 1982 and followed a 0.7 percent increase in the first quarter, the Labor Department said Friday. The agency’s employment cost index, which also includes benefits, also rose 0.2 percent in the second quarter from the prior three months.

Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and her colleagues are counting on rising wages to boost the economy and bring inflation closer to their 2 percent goal. The setback may prompt some officials to call for a delay in raising interest rates for the first time since 2006.

“You’re really not building up the tightness that everyone says,” said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York, who projected the overall ECI would rise 0.5 percent, among the lowest estimates. “For the people who were saying the Fed’s got to raise rates in September, this is a shock.”
The yield on the benchmark 10-year note dropped to 2.21 percent at 8:47 a.m. in New York from 2.26 percent late on Thursday as investors weighed what impact it would have on Fed policy. Stock-index futures rallied after the report.

Survey Results

The median forecast of 57 economists surveyed projected a 0.6 percent increase for the total ECI index. Last quarter’s reading was lower than all estimates, which ranged from increases of 0.4 percent to 0.8 percent. The gauge measures employer-paid taxes such as Social Security and Medicare in addition to the costs of wages and benefits.

Wages and salaries typically account for about 70 percent of total employment expenses. The ECI data help color the outlook for worker pay after the June employment report showed average hourly earnings rose 2 percent from a year earlier, matching the average since the start of the expansion six years ago.

Because the ECI tracks the same job over time, it removes shifts in the mix of workers across industries, which is a shortcoming of the hourly earnings figures.

Wages of all employees, including government workers, advanced 2.1 percent from the same period in 2014 after climbing 2.6 percent year-over-year in the first quarter.

Private Wages

Private wages were little changed in the second quarter from the previous three months, the worst performance since those records began in 1980.

Wage growth has been slow to respond to indications that the labor market is tightening, which would normally cause managers to feel pressure to boost pay amid a smaller pool of workers.

Job openings climbed in May to 5.36 million, the highest in records dating to the end of 2000, Labor Department data show. There are about 1.6 Americans per available position, matching the lowest level since September 2007.

Surveys of small businesses, at least, show managers aren’t planning on further need to raise wages in order to attract and retain employees.

A net 11 percent of managers in June said they plan to increase pay, the fewest since January 2014, according to 620 responses in a National Federation of Independent Business survey. A net 21 percent said they had already recently boosted worker compensation.

Payroll Gains

Wage growth has been slow to emerge even as the job market strengthens. Employers have added an average 208,300 positions a month this year compared with 259,700 in 2014 that was the best in 15 years. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg project 2015 will show a 220,000 average, according to a poll conducted July 2-8.

The unemployment rate is fast approaching the 5-to-5.2 percent range that Fed policy makers have defined as full employment. The rate dropped to 5.3 percent in June, the lowest since April 2008.

“The labor market continued to improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment,” Fed policy makers said in a statement Wednesday at the conclusion of their two-day meeting in Washington. “On balance, a range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources has diminished since early this year.”",15

15-08-01,3fe1c9,22 y/o Advice on 401k and portfolio,"I just received my first paycheck along with a substantial signing bonus. Never having had so much money before, I blindly invested in a bunch of Vanguard mutual funds in a taxable account. I'm now beginning to have doubts about my allocation. 


Here is my taxable account portfolio:  
* $10K VTSAX Total Stock  
* $3K VGTSX Total International Stock  
* $5K VINEX International Explorer  
* $4K VWUSX U.S. Growth  
* $3K VGHCX Health Care Fund  
* $10K Discover Savings  

I am also contributing $800 a month to my 401k with the following allocation:  
* 40% VINIX Institutional Index Fund  
* 15% VEXRX Explorer Fund  
* 35% VTSNX Total International Stock  
* 10% VBTIX Total Bond  


Is this a sensible allocation, or do I have no idea what I am doing? I am a bit concerned that my portfolio is very heavy on U.S. stocks. I'm not too keen on bonds with yields being only marginally higher than my savings account and interest rates set to rise soon. But would it be a good idea to add more exposure to international stocks?


I should also note that my taxable account is mainly to save for a down payment, but that's at least 10 years down the road, so I am willing to accept some volatility. I'm not maxing out my 401k yet, but I may increase my contribution later on once I get a better sense of my spending habits. My spending has been abnormally high this month due to relocation costs and a lot of one-time expenses.

15-08-01,3fetmg,A guaranteed risk-free investment for activists?,"I was thinking about a way a large investor could make an almost risk-free investment/trade. Here are my thoughts:

An investor buy call options of a company he knows will turn him down when he makes a bid to acquire the firm at an above market stock price.

Let us say an environmental activist hedge fund manager like Tom Steyer announces he is willing to buy XYZ Petroleum for a 30% premium. Obviously, the board knows that Steyer doesn't have the firm's interest in mind so they turn down his offer.

However, the ""pop"" in the stock price just for making the bid allows Steyer to exercise the options he bought before he made the announcement for a nice profit. He can then deploy those profits to further his environmental activism.

15-08-01,3fg3ca,Options Experts: Hedging Options with SVXY,"Ok, I know shorting VIX doesn't work well with single stock options. Shorting VIX only makes sense when hedging broad indexes. The thing is, the amount of securities I have long calls and puts on is usually more than a couple hundred, as broad as a broad index. 

Now, how to go about perfectly hedging volatility risk. What's the math? What's the method? Is it possible? Due to my system, I can't just buy when volatility is low, so I need to be able to hedge premium fluctuations.

As example, take a look at XOM. 

Sept 18 ATM Call = 1.60, Put = 3.15

Historic Vol Close = 17%
IV = 20.9%

Volatility is currently high here. In order to stay Vol neutral, what do I need to do?

I can't sell naked, no permissions. Otherwise I'd just write ATM puts on companies that make people sick, make people better, and make people dead.

anyway, to the question. Using this example, if I bought 3 XOM atm calls ($480), exactly how much VIXY would I need to sell short?

And again, I know stocks and VIX they're not directly related, but for 200 calls on different stocks, is there really any better idea? 

I have an idea, which probably sucks. Find the ratio of IV to Historical Vol (IV/Hist) for each stock, get an average. If the average ratio in form of percentage is IV 20% higher than historic (say 20% IV, 16% Historic avg.) I would then take the total amount I've spent on all premiums (40k) and multiply it by .20.

So that would be $8k of svxy (or short 4k of UVXY, to avoid overnight ini margin bullshit). Like mean reverting volatility.

As you can see, I'm innumerate and stupid as all fuck. But I'm really trying here. Please, it would be very appreciated, show me your superior ways.

Love you of course, thanks.",10

I'm mostly trying to build a long term, dividend growth portfolio, but I also want to have some fun fun with short term opportunities. 
Now, though, I see 2 options.
LUV
I've followed southwest a while and wanted to buy in but I didn't have the capital. With their solid growth and beginning to raise that dividend this looks like, to me, a very good long term position.

YHOO
Yahoo is at a very low price and just hit a resistance point,, I think? I'm new to this. So, with their recent purchase of the online fashion company  they could boost their profits, and in turn the stock price.
Plus, they have so much cash, and could instantly pay off all of their debts. This would be a short term purchase, but I see easy money.

I made a video explaining the importance of saving and investing your money the first 5 years of your working career.

If you save 40 000 euro (44 000 dollar) in the first 5 years you will have 155 000 euro (170 000 dollar) more at the end of your career then the guy who did not.
And that is done in the first 5 years!

This is something that children or young adults should learn in school!
I believe this is one of the most important things they can learn.

Soo.. I am a dual citizen (USA &amp; Iran).. and I've noticed that interest rates in Iran are very alarming high. Last time I visited my family member had an account with 20,000$ (it was in rials but that is the dollar equivalent) in it while receiving 20% annually. At first thought i thought this was really weird? I kept asking my family and that didn't answer my questions so here i am asking you guys.. If the interest is soo high in Iran should i move a good amount of money there and just let it collect interest or is there more to this / a catch that im not seeing?

Im in my final year of high school. No job, no debts, will probably have to borrow a good amount of money to attend the college i want to go to.. even after scholarships. Only good thing i have for me is i have 10k in a US bank account that i managed to save up throughout my life.

* How old are you?
* Are you employed/making income? How much?
* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)
* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)
* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
* Any big debts?

EDIT:  

* The main question is: will the value of the Dinar continue to increase enough to ever reach pre-war heights again?  

* To clarify, I was in the region during OIF (over 10 years ago) and bought $750 USD worth of Iraqi Dinar in the local economy.  A lot of comments here are lumping this into the current ""Dinar scam"" though, which isn't the same thing IMO; I did not pay a fee or a middle man.

* The 1m Dinar I bought is worth more today than at the time of purchase, albeit not millions more...  so that's why I'm loosely classifying it as an ""investment"", i.e. something I can sell later for a higher value.",50

15-08-02,3fic44,Your Top 5-10 Loyal3 Stock Picks and Why,"Mine are:

**Alibaba/BABA** - It was talked about a lot on TV and I decided to try it out.  I have seen it go up and down.  I have only kept $10 on it at this point since it hasn't made any strong earnings for me.

**Amazon/AMZN** - It was showing consistent growth even before the latest sales report.  And it is a company that continues to grow.

**Apple/AAPL** - It hasn't been doing so good right now, but I have been reading that it isn't going to plummet and there are huge opportunities for growth once it finds the next revolutionary device.

**Google/GOOGL** - I have always been investing in Google as far back as I can remember.  I have also had to sell stocks to take care of other financial situations.  But right now, I am going in as much as I can.  They are always coming out with new things, most of which they know will fail, but the lessons learned lead to improving or innovation something else.

**Microsoft/MSFT** - I am all about investing in competitive companies, like Apple, Google, Microsoft.  It helps to see when one dips, another will go up, or other fun situations.  This is also a long established company with consistent growth and innovation.

**Store Capital/STOR** - I did this more as a high risk, see what happens, kind of thing.  So far it has been growing steadily so I will continue to invest in it.

**Teladoc/TDOC** - Same reason as Store Capital, but I also wanted to get in from the IPO.  Sadly I missed it by a hair, but I still was able to get in right as it began to grow.  Seems stable and going strong so I will stick with it.

My opinions on these are my own, and some have research behind them, others just cause I wanted to try them out.  If you have any input, I would be greatful.  I do invest through Robinhood as well when I can buy whole shares of stock at a time.  I like Loyal3 cause I can do $10 at a time on a stock if I am not too sure on it without losing too much.

- gives you a different perspective on a stock

- might help you discover things that you can investigate further that you wouldn't have thought of otherwise

- can provide a second opinion to check your biases against

I really enjoy adding money to my account. It's like feeding the tamagotchi I never had as a kid. I started off conservatively, and have been buying the (mostly) blue chip stocks that pay dividends, or the safer juggernauts of FANG. Then something magical happened.

I found GIG and made my first Yolo. At present I am working and putting myself through nursing school so I don't have a lot of money to invest, but fifty shares of GIG have awakened the beast within.  

I come looking for sources of information, both where to learn and where to get current information (news, tables, fundamentals... )

At present I use yahoo finance, seeking alpha, investopedia, and Microsoft money as resources, and I am watching some Kahn academy videos to learn how to read income statements... Etc.

 I am putting myself through school as I work, but mainly have the days free to myself. I trade using what my peasant wallet can afford: robinhood and loyal 3 to access pricier shares.

EDIT: [Here is the list](http://i.imgur.com/dtkOLM5.png). The highlighted ones are in.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey, 

I have a tonne of time to kill this week and was looking to occupy it with some stocks to value. 

Rather than do it just for me, I thought I would value stocks that /r/investing wanted. 

**The proposal:**

- Post the company you would like valued. Others vote it up or down. 
- The 10 companies that have the most votes by end of day Monday (11:59pm EST on August 3, 2015) are the ones I will value.
- I'll post the results of each valuation in a separate thread by the end of this week for everyone to judge.

**Rules:**

- No penny stocks
- No pre-revenue companies 
- Less popular is better. I'm not sure what value I can add by being the 10 millionth person to value Apple or Tesla or IBM. Go beyond the ""big boys"". It'll be more interesting that way. [READ THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3fk5u9/i_have_time_to_kill_what_stock_do_you_want_valued/ctpo1ov) &amp; [THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3fk5u9/i_have_time_to_kill_what_stock_do_you_want_valued/ctpo82v)
- No Resource stocks. They are reliant on commodity prices and that is something I don't feel comfortable projecting out into the future. But I can take a pass at it if people want

**My Promise:**

- Complete Objectivity. I will use only that which I can objectively justify with data as far as possible
- Full transparency. I'll post all my assumptions, thought processes and sources and I'll be around to answer any questions
- A Comfort Rating. I'll rate each valuation from 1 to 5 to illustrate how comfortable I am with the numbers that went into it. For example, a valuation of ConEd would get 4 or 5 because it is easy to know most things about that company great accuracy. it's revenues and margins are regulated and not much is going to change about its market

Hope this is something people are interested in. 


EDIT: grammar, many missing words and a re-wording to make things succinct

So, finding a time to sell upside calls means that we must find a time when we are ""confident"" that there is no more significant upside. Selling this upside should simultaneously enhance returns and reduce exposure.

The next question is to find out *when* we should be confident that there is no more significant upside. 

**Background:** Bollinger Bands are a technical tool used to analyze when a stock is overbought or oversold. If this is a new term [check Investopedia for an introduction](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bollingerbands.asp).  In my opinion, they are *not a good signal* for going purely long or short. However, given options' ability to profit from moving sideways or slight direction, I believe BBands should provide a decent signal to sell premium.

In this post, I'll be looking at backtesting a strategy on SPY that involves selling covered calls based on Bollinger Band positions. To prevent overfitting, I'll declare a standard BBand Strategy here, and test nothing else:

1. Using 40-day volatility/SMA window and 2 standard deviations, enter a position after the stock moves from 'above' to 'below' the upper band.

What option should we sell? Most option selling strategies involves selling something close to 60 calendar days to expiry. This is when theta starts to accelerate. Let's sell the option:

1. closest to 60 days to expiry.
2. around 5% out-of-the-money (strike price is 5% above spot price)

**Results:**

From Jan '07 to Feb '15, with SPY underlying, it seems that this strategy performed fairly well. Here are some summary statistics:

Strategy | Sharpe Ratio | Cumulative Return | # Stock Trades | # Option Trades 
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Buy/Hold|.38|77.5%|1|0
Covered Call|.40|85.4%|1|10

[Buy/Hold vs. Covered Call Strategy Performance Visualized](http://i.imgur.com/EYXOvkT.png)


**Significance:** What if we sold 5% OTM calls randomly, ten times since '07? I simulated some random dates to sell the calls. On average, the random strategy expected to make 78.25% cumulative return. Our return of 85.4% is in the upper 15% quantile of these randomly simulated strategies. This would translate to a .15 p-value, which is *not* very significant. 

**Summary, TL;DR:** It seems like at first look, we can increase our returns by selling covered calls every time SPY recovers from hitting the upper 40d/2sd Bollinger Band. Trading 10 times, It improved our returns by 8% over 8 years. With such a small sample and significance value (.15), we cannot immediately determine that this is a great strategy. However, the results are interesting enough to do a little more digging and optimization.

So thanks to ya'll I was able to pick and invest $3k in VASGX about a year ago. While the return over the past year hasn't been anything stellar, I'm happy with the return. I wanted to invest some more using Vanguard and was looking for some advice on what to invest in.

I was going to first invest more into VASGX, but being 21 and finishing college it keeps being suggested to me to invest into something more volatile/stock-based. I've been doing research and eyeing some funds like VGHCX (Health Care Fund), VWUSX (U.S. Growth Fund), VISGX (Small-Cap Growth Index Fund), and VTSMX (Total Stock Market Index Fund).

VGHCX is obviously attractive due to the past returns, but I realize that means little in terms of future returns. I personally expect the health care sector to do well, but like Vanguard puts it the ""narrow scope"" of the fund may not be the best.

I'm intending to invest the minimum $3,000 into one fund, otherwise I would spread it out more. What would you guys suggest?",1

Sony is looking to get into Virtual reality, and so far they have a solid product from what I hear. I guess what they discussed at E3 was that you'll see things like this early on: A real estate website or agent that can allow you to walk into a house with the VR goggles.

VPN friendly(for those living in harmonious china): 

China’s leadership is preparing fresh fiscal spending to ensure that signs of economic weakening don’t put their 2015 growth target out of reach, a danger that was underscored by a deterioration in manufacturing in July. Ahead of the top leadership’s annual gathering at the Beidaihe seaside resort east of Beijing, the Communist Party’s Politburo pledged last week to make “pre-emptive” policy adjustments in the second half. Premier Li Keqiang highlighted one area targeted for spending will be a “severely outdated” underground pipe system in the nation’s expanding megacities.

Factories could use the work that such construction projects will bring, with an official gauge of manufacturing slipping to a five-month low in July. The release indicated a drop in new orders and jobs, adding to threats that include a near-$4 trillion rout in Chinese stocks and a fall in car sales that endanger Li’s goal of about 7 percent growth this year.

“Fiscal policies will be the key to growth stabilization measures in the second half,” said Zhu Qibing, a macroeconomic analyst at China Minzu Securities Co. in Beijing.“The government’s recent signals and policy direction clearly show that a new round of fiscal stimulus is coming,” he said. To finance the spending, China has enlarged a debt swap program for local authorities that’s cutting their borrowing costs, and is expanding the lending capacity at so-called policy banks -- government-run lenders that implement public-policy objectives. The People’s Bank of China may also free up more commercial-bank reserves to be used for lending, economists said.

**Dual Measures**

“We expect additional infrastructure spending as well as a RRR cut,” Dariusz Kowalczyk, a strategist at Credit Agricole CIB, said before the official purchasing manager index release on Saturday. A private gauge, from Caixin Media and Markit Economics, is due for release Monday. A preliminary estimate of that index fell to a 15-month low.

Threats to growth mean Li and President Xi Jinping have had to suspend for now an initiative to rein in leverage in the world’s second-largest economy that soared under the previous leadership team of Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao. While a booming stock market had offered one channel for reducing corporate leverage, that got constricted with the equities slide.

The Shanghai Composite Index of stocks fell 10 percent last week, arresting three weeks of gains. The China Automobile Dealers Association Friday warned that a continuing share decline could contribute to the country seeing the first annual drop in vehicle sales in more than 17 years.

**Airports, Pipes**

With the building industry hurt by an overhang of properties, infrastructure spending will be key to driving growth. Premier Li said last week that expediting the construction of a modern underground pipe system in China’s big cities will be a new growth driver, according to the People’s Daily website. China will also support construction of airports in central and western regions, the State Council said.

Urbanization has put strains on the utility systems in China’s big cities. Flooding has sometimes proves deadly, as highlighted by the loss of 79 people following a July 2012 rainstorm. Initial underreporting of the death toll on that occasion also spurred public criticism in the Communist nation.

“This move is intended to support activity growth,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts including Yu Song wrote in a July 30 note, referring to the plans to modernize urban underground pipe systems. “Without further policy support, growth is at risk of falling significantly below the official target.”

**Addressing Usefulness**

Spending in areas of underinvestment can boost short-term growth and help ease concern over the usefulness of government-led outlays, the Goldman analysts said. To fund these efforts, authorities may issue more local government bonds, prod agencies to utilize idle fiscal deposits, and keep monetary conditions loose, they said. Central bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan has already this year lowered the required reserve ratio twice, with an additional move targeted to certain banks, and cut benchmark interest rates four times since the start of November.

Officials are also acting to boost lending. The State Council said last week China will encourage banks to increase loan support for the tourism sector.

More directly, authorities are expanding lending capacity at the country’s policy banks. The central bank has put $48 billion into China Development Bank Corp., people familiar with the matter said last month. Export-Import Bank of China got $45 billion, and 100 billion yuan ($16 billion) from the Ministry of Finance went to the Agricultural Development Bank of China, Caixin magazine reported.

Weak overseas and local demand damped manufacturing in July, the national statistics bureau said Aug. 1. “We have seen no sign of recovery in the manufacturing sector,” said Zhu Haibin, chief China economist at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. in Hong Kong. “We may see manufacturing bottom in the third quarter as the government continues and steps up measures to stabilize growth.”",4

15-08-03,3fmt7s,Micro-Cap Fraud Involving Cynk Technology,"www.StockPromoters.com

On Friday, the SEC charged a Canadian citizen with conducting a scheme to conceal his control and ownership of a micro-cap company whose price quickly spiked last year. The SEC suspended trading in the stock, Cynk Technology Corp. (OTCMKTS: CYNK) before the alleged schemer, Phillip Thomas Kueber, could profit on the gains from the stock’s rise to more than $21 from less than 10 cents per share.

The SEC alleges that Kueber was behind a false and misleading registration statement filed by Cynk and enlisted a small group of straw shareholders and sham CEOs to conceal his control of purportedly non-restricted shares in Cynk stock. The complaint alleges that the straw shareholders – mainly Kuber’s family members and associates in British Columbia and California – never received the shares they “purchased.” Kueber allegedly transferred the shares to brokerage accounts and offshore shell companies he secretly controlled and misled broker-dealers about his ownership of the shares to create the false appearance of a company with publicly held shares.

According to the SEC’s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Kueber was unable to cash in on selling his Cynk shares when the SEC suspended trading in Cynk on July 11, 2014 amid suspicious activity surrounding the company’s stock. Once trading resumed, the share price fell, closing at 60 cents per share on July 28, 2014.
 
“We allege that Kueber used straw shareholders, offshore dummy corporations, and puppet corporate officers to gain and conceal control over the majority of Cynk shares,” said Michael Paley, Co-Chair of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Microcap Fraud Task Force. “Law enforcement has again pierced through the layers of deceit to hold an alleged wrongdoer accountable, in this case before he could liquidate his shares in the open market and realize ill-gotten profits.”
 
The SEC’s complaint alleges that Kueber violated the antifraud provisions of federal securities laws and related SEC antifraud rules. The SEC is seeking to impose a civil monetary penalty, to bar Kueber from serving as a public company officer or director or participating in a penny-stock offer, and to be subject to a court-ordered injunction against future antifraud violations.",0

15-08-03,3fmeva,"So I've moved all my cash into Meryll.... They're slapping me with a 3.7-4.2% baseline fee between the managment group and merylls costs. I'm trying to pay a pricey monthly maintence with the dividends and compound whats left, is that possible with such a fee? Am I just wrong to worry?","tl;dr. Here is what info I have so far about my investments:
http://i61.tinypic.com/6zljs5.jpg what do I do to find out more (request MyMerill, will that show me trade by trade whats going on? is that gonna incure a fee, it didnt mention it would). It's a bit complicated, with an IRA and personal account setup



Yes, it's a complicated account/trust/IRA. Basically I've just received those notebooks from Meryll, and hey the group managment fee is 1.50% and merylls is a sliding scale from 2.00-2.70, I'm not entirely sure if that's on a per account basis or over all assets. I doubt style fee's will come into play TO much, but what I'm worried about is this:

My IRA set for retirement (it's a strange IRA... I have to take out a minimum amount every year) has about 650,000 and I doubt I'll be touching that for years.

I have a personal account as well (these are the accounts I'm worried wont be treated as a single thing) with just about 1,000,000 in it. My thoughts, pre-advisor, would be to riskfully invest maybe 150,000 while keeping the lionshare in the nice little 1% CD it was in before. With this ""risky investments"" I'd hope to make about 4,000 a month in profit overall, it does seem a bit steep, even with no experience I guess that seemed a bit outrageous.

So when I spoke with my investment manager we basically agreed that our goal with my short term account was to create $4,000 a month without losing principle (this is the maintence fee for the home I live in, nullify this fee and I'll be able to relocate, sublet the apartment maybe, etc - and if all else fails, just sell it. Which I'm ALSO terrified of, becuause if the apartment is sold it goes into this Meryll Trust, where I'm presuming they take there fee right off the bat. But thats another problem for another story another day.... 

So is it feasible to return 4,000+ a month so I can compound a bit and realistially my bills are closer to 6,000 a month. 4,000 is solely the home. All the while with a base minimum fee of 4.20%? He said they'd have to return about 6% to do what I'm asking, but with there fee tacked on that's nearly 10%.

I'll be talking with him during the week as I'm very curious whats going on. The information I have is very little, it's just a % chart of what my money is invested in where. I guess I'll have to ask for a more detailed listing? Maybe MyMerill will tell me all about that?

I'm mainly interesting in seeing how the money is moving around, that way I can tell you guys and ya'll can tell me if I'm being screwed with.

My wealth manager is a family friend of 30 years who's managed my uncles account for a long time. It's not a single person but a ""managment group"" so I'm sure I'm a small fish to them; especially since I think I have less in the market than my uncle. He has more flexibility than I do and is not trying to maintain an expensive apartment for sublet.

All I see is that our risk is moderate, were willing to lose principle to gain our overall goal, and everything is by no means FDIC insured. I have $150,000 left in an insured CD making 1% that I guess I'll do something with if this turns out to be a crap shoot; but I'd like to start doing that something ahead of time. How can I start my own self-direction? I'm perfectly fine using Merill EDGE considering I already seem to have accounts with them -- does that make sense? Or should I go with someone with minimal fees?

Any experience with merill? How do I find out what stocks my wealth managment group has me in? Its likely all sorts of index stocks, and I think they have a clause that I can't audit them or have an arbitration, I sure read something like that.

Here is the probably pointless image I have so far....
http://i61.tinypic.com/6zljs5.jpg


P.S. I'm terrified the market will have another dip in the next 5 years which is the time period the trust exists. It's the home I'm mainly concerned by, I don't want it being sold just so that someone can get a cut of money. Thats ridiculous and not what my family intended. Now, if it's impossible to maintain this home with my current assets and I cannot find employment to even it out then I'll regrettably sell.

My reasoning for holding my home is that its value is not decreasing sanz a nuke goes off nearby and that in 10-15 years+ years I have a feeling the value of the apartment will appreciate roughly similar to how the stock market moves.

While on the topic of reasoning, and to finish this off, clearly I'm plagued by a lack of knowledge. Where can I find this knowledge? I've read some of the side link bars, I've looked into robin hood. Would that be a good way to start learning whats going on?

I've made a few posts here about my situation, but now that the moneys actually moved and the fees are set I think it's time I see some information or results. Since it was a family thing there was no formal handshake (haven't actually met the guy yet), no formal agreement other than the basic paperwork they sent. Well, this is getting long, but I'm mainly curious how to find out what's going on in these trades.

Is there a particular class I could take that would familiarize myself with this? Or could I really just start small with something like robinhood and learn the real way?


Basically, I'd like to learn about my money and what's going on with it. I don't intend on taking this out and going self-directed, but I'd love to start learning on my own. Obviously, I've always been fascinated with margin and day trading...

 I don't want to audit my uncle or the trust as that sounds ugly, without auditing can I get a full list of the transactions from MyMerill, I havent asked for MyMerill access yet cause I was worried there'd be a fee lol. Or is that asking to much in an account with this level of complication?

15-08-03,3fn5b6,Why the bullishness around General Electric (GE)?,"At the moment GE is rated as a 4/5 by Morningstar and is overall rated quite favorably by most analysts. 

I just looked at their numbers and listened to their Q2 earnings webcast but their EPS numbers along with overall numbers wasnt exactly blowing me away and also GE is currently going through quite a transition with selling off their GE Capital assets. 



As a dividend growth investor im mostly interested in a couple things, what is the current yield (3.55%) and can they sustain/grow that dividend over time. 

According to morningstar (http://financials.morningstar.com/ratios/r.html?t=GE&amp;region=usa&amp;culture=en-US) GE has over the TTM a payout ratio of 176% and a negative EPS of -0.62 vs a dividend of 0.91.

So obviously earnings are not covering their dividend which is a major red flag for me (unless im missing something, if so please correct me, that is essentially the point of this post)

Now obviously by selling off GE Capital GE will come out slimmer and a more industry focused company, is this what the bullishness is based of off? personally i see it as over valued (PE 19.96 according to my brokerage however MS states 50.7?) and i think there are better opportunities elsewhere but im just a youngster still learning the ropes so can someone come with a good schooling on this?

Edit: I forgot to mention that i do believe GE stated in their webcast they expect an EPS for the year to come out between 1.13 - 1.20 which will cover their dividend (0.92) with a payout ratio between 76 - 81% which is still quite a bit high for my preference.",31

I am enrolled in a Charles Schwab brokerage account, where I do not appear to be paying fees for maintenance or management. As funds become available from my paychecks, I am transferring funds into the brokerage account. I am then purchasing no-commission ETFs, with an eye toward those that have low gross expense ratios. I have a target overall allocation, but rather than waiting back to have several thousand dollars at once, and to achieve it in one go, I am building toward it piece by piece - $40 here, $200 there, etc. The allocation is roughly the consensus approach you're all familiar with, weighted heavily toward S&amp;P 500 and other basic indexes. I am not planning to sell anything in the near future.

The upside of this approach is psychological - I have an incentive to save and put my money into investments, and it ""gamifies"" my investment in a way - I get the excitement every two weeks of putting my money into an investment. Another upside is that, as near as I can tell, I am paying no fees whatsoever (though there are the risks inherent in any ETF, and the expense of management).

I'd like to be sure, though, that I'm not missing something. Is there a catch I'm not seeing? For instance: are the gains likely higher if I were to save up $1k or $2k, and then purchase commission ETFs? Are no-commission ETFs notoriously weak performers? Etc.

Finally, to be clear: I'm not asking for substantive investment advice, about stocks or allocations or anything. Just procedural - whether this kind of approach may be foolish, for reasons I'm not seeing.

15-08-04,3fopbf,Using ETFs for an Emergency Fund,"Full disclosure, I manage money for a living.

It seems to be  ""common knowledge"" that having at least 6 months of living expenses in a savings account is a best practice in personal finance.  However, these past years savings accounts have earned nothing, and over that past 5 years, you would have been down 9.6% in purchasing power. This means adding more of your hard earned money into your ""emergency fund.""  I think there is a better way.

I now keep about 4-6 weeks of living expenses in cash, and 5 months worth of living expenses in a separate Vanguard account.  In this account I hold 2 ETFs, 70% in BIV and 30% in VTI.  My current expected return is 5% with a standard deviation of 5.2%. Since 1950, a similar portfolio would have generated a geometric return of 7.6%, with a worst 12 month return of -12.1%. 

Using this strategy, I do not need to add to my emergency fund every year, and recently have been able to take some out and put it with my more aggressive investment accounts. I do now keep it 105% funded. 

A word of caution if you decide to do something similar: There is risk here, and there is no guarantee that equities and bonds will continue with there current correlation.  However, I view this risk to be lower than the inflation risk. 

What do you all think? Have any of you done something similar? Would you change anything?

I was curious about this but am having trouble finding answers online.  All the answers I am finding, are answering the obvious, although not exactly the same, question.  I understand supply and demand and why stocks fluctuate.  I am specifically talking about the price of the stock listed on a website.

With stocks I've bought or sold, sometimes it has sold for higher prices that were never registered on a site.  I am just using free stocks sites, might the price not register because they are simply less detailed?  Is the price listed an average for a period of time?  

I am curious because I am considering a stop on quote order for one of my positions, and am wondering what triggers the event.  I assume a single person/trade can cause it to be triggered, correct?  If so, I've also read that stop on quote acts like a market in that the price may differ after its been triggered, so does that mean that once it gets to the point to finalize, it will just sell at whatever the last trade bought/sold for?

15-08-04,3frc5z,Ken Paxton Accused of Securities Fraud,"www.StockPromoters.com

The Texas state attorney general surrendered himself yesterday to authorities at the Collin County jail where he was fingerprinted and photographed before being released on $35,000 bond.

Ken Paxton is charged with two first-degree felonies for securities fraud and a third-degree felony for failing to register with the state to sell securities.

The securities fraud indictments are related to Servergy, a McKinney-based company that has been under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The failure to register charge is connected to Paxton's friend and campaign donor Fritz Mowery, a McKinney investment adviser, to whom Paxton referred clients without telling them that he'd been getting hefty commissions.

The first-degree securities fraud indictments carry a potential penalty of up 99 years in prison. The third-degree charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.

The indictments relate to alleged conduct that occurred while he was serving in the state legislature. Paxton was sworn in as attorney general on January 1st of this year.

It was last May when he was disciplined by the Texas State Securities Board after he admitted that he'd solicited clients for his friend's investment firm without being registered with the state, as the law requires.

The securities fraud allegations involved losses in excess of $100,000. Mr. Paxton convinced a group of investors to invest more than $600,000 in Servergy in 2011 and failed to tell the investors - which included State Rep. Byron Cook, R-Corsicana - that he was getting a commission on the deal and falsely claimed that he was an investor in the company.
The investors filed suit in 2013 against Servergy, demanding that the company open its books for inspection.

15-08-04,3fpb7k,Buying an investment property and renting your own residence,"When you buy your first property, generally, you buy your primary residence. This means that you can afford to buy a place where you work, which is often hard to do if you live in a high cost of living area and are at the very start of your career, and also that you should be pretty sure that you will spend the next few years in said place, because if real estate prices go down, or simply if you move just a year after you buy, between the closing costs, realtor fees and the cost of moving in, you may lose money.

Another idea would be instead to buy a rental, so you can get the benefits of getting on the property ladder while at the same time keep the flexibility of renting a property fit for your needs.

Why would you opt for a rental?
Well as I said above, the first thing that comes to mind is that your local property market may not be ideal for home ownership if priced are on the rise. The rent vs buy calculations may not lean towards buying in overpriced housing bubbles. But you live there, so you still need a place to stay. What better way to have someone pay your rent while you build up equity on the property they live in?

You may not make enough to buy a place in New York, but already have savings that would represent a hefty deposit in Kansas City. And the rent would bring a better return on your deposit than the 0.1% your cash is bringing right now.

If you are living with a significant other, and not ready to put both names on the deed, it allows you to keep your place together while you start investing on your own.

And if you are just starting your career, you should not get tied to a property when your next job could be 3,000 miles away.

By buying a rental, you could move pretty much anywhere without worrying about having to sell your home before doing so. That is what I did with my UK property. I lived there for less than a year (with roommates) before putting the whole place up for rent and moving to Morocco. Now, I am still a continent away, and on top of that have put six time zones between my property and myself. And you know what? It works out just fine.

My tenants each rent a bedroom on separate contracts, and when one is about to vacate, they interview potential tenants to find the new roommate. I take care of bills and include them in their rent so they don’t have to fight about splitting them equally. The only little bumps on the way are generally about cleaning habits of some of them, so I am thinking about raising the rents and including a weekly cleaner. Other than this, if the washing machine or the heater breaks, I just send a handyman and wire them the money.

So I wouldn’t be worried about having a property two hours drive away, if one ocean away is doable.

What I thought before I left was that the rent I would get from the bedroom I used to occupy, around $1,000, would basically cover my rental needs anywhere in the world. Yes, $1,000 is pretty expensive for a room, but that is under market price when said room is in an affluent suburb of London. I have only had one week vacancy in one of the rooms over the past 5 years.

In Guatemala, $1,000 happens to cover my entire living expenses and the salaries of two staff, because I paid cash for my house, but it would more than cover my rent of a three bed luxury condo in a great neighborhood of Guatemala City. Even in Europe, aside from London, Paris and a few overpriced capitals, I could get a comfy two bedroom and live on my own. And if I felt like going back to Paris for a while, $1,000 would still get me an independent, albeit smaller unit.

I really like that the money from rent can be allocated to my living expenses, just like the time my motorcycle insurance company paid for some advertising on my blogs, enough to cover two years of bike insurance. You get the idea, getting a fixed source of income gives you the freedom of using that same income to cover the same category of expense for your flexible life.

 

Where should you buy a property?
If you have a nomadic lifestyle like I do, the world is pretty much your oyster. And if your career could take you anywhere in the country, buying next to where you live now may not be buying where your next job will be, so once again, you could look at your whole state, or your whole country. Some ideas include

- A college town. Students rarely buy a place during their college years, and you have a constant influx of potential new tenants. I am in a college town and my prices deter the freshmen so usually I get the PhD students or the recent graduates working their first job. They are serious, and often have mum and dad behind, which is extra consolation.

- Your hometown. While you may not live there at the beginning of your career, you may aspire to come back once you settle down and start a family. Plus your parents could keep an eye on the property, send their trusted handyman to do maintenance or chase payments face to face for you. You don’t want to be a burden but it gives you some peace of mind to know there is still a family member nearby if things go sour. You are also able to make an educated decision about each neighborhood without too much research, as you lived there for years.

- The highest yielding market. A quick online search will tell you which markets offer the highest rent in your region of choice.

- The best house you can afford on a high down payment. Things may not always go the way you planned and your property may sit empty for a while, and having low repayments will make life much easier. You could look for a place that is affordable right now, and put a 30-50% deposit on it, so the rent is only a fraction of the repayments. That will also allow you to live on the surplus should you lose your job, to pay off the rest of the mortgage early as well, or to set aside a good chunk of money for future renovations.

- A duplex. When you live a nomadic lifestyle, you often want a base to come home to. Buying a duplex or a triplex allows you to have renters pay most of the housing costs while you still keep a small unit as your own to store your stuff and re-energize when you are tired of traveling. Plus they serve as free house sitters!",1

15-08-04,3frk0m,SEC Charges Houston-Based Businessman with Operating a Ponzi Scheme,"www.StockPromoters.com 

Yesterday, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a Houston-area businessman with operating a $114 million Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors, some of whom were told that their money would fund technology to prevent accidents caused by drowsy driving.

The SEC’s case filed in federal court in Houston, charged Frederick Alan Voight of Richmond, Texas with defrauding more than 300 investors in multiple offerings of promissory notes issued by two partnerships he owns, F.A. Voight &amp; Associates LP and DayStar Funding LP. While Voight’s latest offering promised investors returns as high as 42 percent a year from loans to small public companies, most of the funds went to pay earlier investors, the complaint alleges. Approximately $22 million of Voight’s allegedly ill-gotten gains remain unaccounted for to date.

According to the SEC’s complaint, Voight recently raised $13.8 million that he said would be loaned to a startup named InterCore Inc. (OTCMKTS: ICOR) to fund its deployment of a “Driver Alertness Detection System,” or DADS. Starting in October 2014, Voight allegedly wrote to prospective investors about a “tremendous” opportunity to help InterCore install the DADS technology into “several million trucks and buses,” which he said was enough for the company to pay the 30 to 42 percent annual interest rates on the promissory notes “many, many times over.” 

Voight knew the claims were false because he served on InterCore’s board and was aware that the Delray Beach, Florida public company was financially troubled and had no means to pay back the loans, the complaint alleges. 

The SEC alleges that Voight used funds from the DADS investors to make Ponzi payments to earlier investors or funneled them to InterCore through two of his other partnerships, Rhine Partners LP and Topside Partners LP. The complaint alleges that InterCore sent the funds to its Montreal-based subsidiary, InterCore Research Canada, Inc., where the funds seemingly disappeared. By routing funds through Rhine and Topside, Voight is alleged to have garnered benefits – including fees and InterCore stock warrants – that he never disclosed to the DADS investors.

SEC’s complaint charges Voight and DayStar with securities fraud and with conducting unregistered securities offerings. Voight and Daystar, without admitting or denying the allegations, agreed to settle the SEC’s complaint by consenting to permanent injunctions against committing these violations in the future. They also agreed to asset freezes and other emergency relief, and to pay civil penalties and return allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest in amounts to be set later by the court. 

Voight also consented to being barred from serving as a public company officer or director and to be barred permanently from participating in the offer, purchase, or sale of any security except for his own personal account.

The SEC will litigate its claims against relief defendants InterCore and InterCore Research. ",0

15-08-04,3frqvc,Teen Sentenced for Securities Fraud,"www.StockPromoters.com 

Last week, Devon, England teen Sam Cook was slapped with a 26-month jail term after he admitted that he had committed securities fraud. The 18-year said he turned a £2,000 investment from his father into £21 million. Not bad, but also not true.

Living a lavish lifestyle, Sam claimed to own a £165,000 Ferrari, popped on expensive vacations and lived in a pricey waterfront apartment. But it was a keen-eyed police officer that brought him down. You see Cook had photos of himself taken as he was leaning against said Ferrari and they were published in national newspapers in Britain. The cop, who saw the photos, became suspicious that the vehicle was a real Ferrari.

Upon further investigation, the truth was revealed. Young Sam, it seems, billed himself as a broker had actually lied about his extreme wealth to convince investors he would put their money into stocks and currency in an attempt to earn them more money. Instead of investing the money entrusted to him, he pocketed the cash and spent it on himself. He conned more than £100,000 from unsuspecting clients.

Cook took £15,000 from his first victim, £35,000 from his second and £6,200 from his third – a woman who was saving to replace her car.
His fourth victim paid £5,000 to Cook after borrowing from family and friends, while his fifth victim also paid £5,000.

The sixth victim paid a total of £50,000 to Cook and had been left extremely “stressed” following the deception, Ms Scrivener said.
After admitting the fraud to police, Cook told officers: “This has had a big effect on my family and completely ruined my chances of getting a job in finance”

Representing Cook, Michael Green said his client’s father was already taking steps to repay the money to the victims.

And the “Ferrari”? Well, it was actually a £20,000 replica.

A Proceeds of Crime hearing will take place at a later date to recover money taken by Cook.",0

So far the reddit consensus seems to be that with such lackluster performances and high fees, wealth management is not worth it. In a nutshell...

1. Wealth managers don’t beat the market and the performance isn’t sustainable.

2. The fees are too high even if your portfolio beat the market.

3. Wealth managers do not explain their rationale well enough, or business model honestly to the client.

4. This is all a psychological game: Clients are often locked into wealth managers because of personal connections or trust setup, and are not happy about losing the understanding over what, why, and how they money is invested.

15-08-04,3fs3i1,How I Calculate Intrinsic Value (Fundametally Wrong?),"I thought I might talk you through how I perform my intrinsic value calculations and maybe some of you with more experience could explain to me what's on the right path, and what is way off base.

&amp;nbsp;

**Step 1)** Determine the Book Value/Share from as far back as possible (10 years if available).

&amp;nbsp;

**Step 2)** For each year, divide the Net Income by Shares outstanding to determine the Net Income/Share. Also input the Dividends/Share if appropriate.

&amp;nbsp;

**Step 3)** Subtract the Div/Share from the NI/Share and add this to the BV to determine the next year's BV/Share (basically capturing all income reinvested in some form back into the company). We now have the first part of the intrinsic value calculation, the current clean book value for 2014.

&amp;nbsp;

**Step 4)** Each year, calculate a modified ROE (NI/Share / BV/Share) and determine the retention rate of income (NI/Share - Div/Share)/(NI/Share). This allows a more honest view of how firm equity is generating new income without a lot of accountancy noise distracting you (e.g. costs are immediately captured instead of being amoritized over a longer period). When you have 10 years of information, you can find an average Retention Rate and 'ROE' for your future projections.

&amp;nbsp;

**Step 5)** Now begin the projections: For ten future years, the BV/Share is simply the previous BV/Share * (1 + ROE * Retention Rate)

&amp;nbsp;

**Step 6)** With these future BV/Shares, the Net Income each year is projected with the historic average 'ROE' from earlier.

&amp;nbsp;

**Step 7)** For the second part of the intrinsic calculation, these future incomes are added together and a present value calculation is conducted on the total (I use a 15% discount, but you can choose whatever you please).

&amp;nbsp;

**Step 8)** Finally, the current (2014) clean book value is added to the present value of ten years of future earnings (discounted to present value at a rate of 15%) to create an intrinsic value. I simply need to now see how that matches against the current price.

&amp;nbsp;

There are more steps that I follow other than this, but with a spreadsheet doing most of the work I only need to enter 31 values (a 2005 book value, all net income, shares outstanding and dividends paid) to see if the company is worth more research.",16

On their next call, (which is tomorrow) I am 90% sure they're going to announce a new deal in which would perpetuate their ongoing onslaught of a growth based on their history and CEO's strategy. 

Other things to help keep the skepticals at bay:
- If anything, look at their balance sheet and you know that they're gonna make a profit. They have been growing their revenue at a large pace. 
- We all know China is looking to takeover undervalued companies for a nice discount; this being one of them.

15-08-05,3fvcjy,Buy Gold in August,"With the gold price still reeling from the underwhelming China gold reserve update, some may be forgiven for giving up on the yellow metal. 

However the logical conclusion of Chinese authorities not being ready to disclose their full reserves and sticking to the 1.658 tonne number is that they are still buyers, with no interest in pumping the price until they reach their target allocation. It is also interesting that they are dumping Treasuries at a dangerous rate.

Even in the current correction, a downtrend that has lasted since 2011, gold seasonality has been extremely positive from August to February. Buying gold before the end of summer and selling before spring has been a winning trade in 2011, 2012 and 2013, all negative years for gold. In 2014 this trade broke even. Needless to say in the previous years 2005-2010 it did even better.

I would argue, as Jim Rogers and Jim Rickards do, that the current correction is almost over with $980-1000 as an almost optimal entry point before the resumption of the decade-long uptrend. A 40-50% retracement is natural after 500% gains.

Negative interest rates and completely unprecedented monetary policies from the world's major central banks are, in the long term, extremely bullish for gold.

Here is a summary of their pipeline. Of particular note is that their drug targets the multiple etiologies associated with Alzheimer’s disease including the Tau receptor, which the Mayo clinic just came out yesterday and said was the key driving force in Alzheimer’s. 

Here is the article: http://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-03-thousands-brains-reveals-tau-driver.html 

Our Pipeline 

Our pipeline includes one clinical drug candidate and several compounds in different stages of pre-clinical study. 
Our proprietary SIGMACEPTOR™ Discovery Platform produced small molecule drug candidates with unique modes of action, based on our understanding of sigma receptors. Sigma receptors may be targets for therapeutics to combat many human diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease. When bound by the appropriate ligands, sigma receptors influence the functioning of multiple biochemical signals that are involved in the pathogenesis (origin or development) of disease. 

Compounds that have been subjects of our research include the following: 

ANAVEX 2-73 

ANAVEX 2-73 may offer a disease-modifying approach in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by using ligands that activate sigma-1 receptors. 
In AD animal models, ANAVEX 2-73 has shown pharmacological, histological and behavioral evidence as a potential neuroprotective, anti-amnesic, anti-convulsive and anti-depressive therapeutic agent, due to its potent affinity to sigma-1 receptors and moderate affinities to M1-4 type muscarinic receptors. In addition, ANAVEX 2-73 has shown a potential dual mechanism which may impact both amyloid and tau pathology. In a transgenic AD animal model Tg2576 ANAVEX 2-73 induced a statistically significant neuroprotective effect against the development of oxidative stress in the mouse brain, as well as significantly increased the expression of functional and synaptic plasticity markers that is apparently amyloid-beta independent. It also statistically alleviated the learning and memory deficits developed over time in the animals, regardless of sex, both in terms of spatial working memory and long-term spatial reference memory. 

Based on the results of pre-clinical testing, we initiated and completed a Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD) clinical trial of ANAVEX 2-73 in 2011. In this Phase 1 SAD trial, the maximum tolerated single dose was defined per protocol as 55-60 mg. This dose is above the equivalent dose shown to have positive effects in mouse models of AD. There were no significant changes in laboratory or electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters. ANAVEX 2-73 was well tolerated below the 55-60 mg dose with only mild adverse events in some subjects. Observed adverse events at doses above the maximum tolerated single dose included headache and dizziness, which were moderate in severity and reversible. These side effects are often seen with drugs that target central nervous system (CNS) conditions, including AD. 

The ANAVEX 2-73 Phase 1 SAD trial was conducted as a randomized, placebo-controlled study. Healthy male volunteers between the ages of 18 and 55 received single, ascending oral doses over the course of the trial. Study endpoints included safety and tolerability together with pharmacokinetic parameters. 

Pharmacokinetics includes the absorption and distribution of a drug, the rate at which a drug enters the blood and the duration of its effect, as well as chemical changes of the substance in the body. This study was conducted in Germany in collaboration with ABX-CRO, a clinical research organization that has conducted several Alzheimer’s disease studies, and the Technical University of Dresden. 

ANAVEX PLUS 

ANAVEX PLUS, a combination of ANAVEX 2-73 with donepezil (Aricept®) is a potential novel combination drug for Alzheimer’s disease. Aricept® (donepezil) is now generic. ANAVEX 2-73 showed in combination with donepezil an unexpected and clear synergic effect of memory improvement by up to 80% in animal models. A patent application was filed in the US for the combination of donepezil and ANAVEX 2-73 and if granted would give patent protection at least until 2033. 

In a humanized calibrated cortical network computer model the unexpected pre-clinical synergy between ANAVEX 2-73 and donepezil was confirmed and ANAVEX PLUS showed an anticipated ADAS-Cog response of 7 points at 12 weeks and 5.5 points at 26 weeks, which represents more than 2x the ADAS-Cog of donepezil alone. 

ANAVEX 3-71 

ANAVEX 3-71, previously named AF710B is a preclinical drug candidate with a novel mechanism of action via sigma-1 receptor activation and M1 muscarinic allosteric modulation, which has shown to enhance neuroprotection and cognition in Alzheimer's disease. ANAVEX 3-71 is a CNS-penetrable mono-therapy that bridges treatment of both cognitive impairments with disease modifications. It is highly effective in very small doses against the major Alzheimer's hallmarks in transgenic (3xTg-AD) mice, including cognitive deficits, amyloid and tau pathologies, and also has beneficial effects on inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunctions. ANAVEX 3-71 indicates extensive therapeutic advantages in Alzheimer's and other protein-aggregation-related diseases given its ability to enhance neuroprotection and cognition via sigma-1 receptor activation and M1 muscarinic allosteric modulation. 

ANAVEX 1-41 

ANAVEX 1-41 is a sigma-1 agonist. Pre-clinical tests revealed significant neuroprotective benefits (i.e., protects nerve cells from degeneration or death) through the modulation of endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrial and oxidative stress, which damages and destroys cells and is believed by some scientists to be a primary cause of AD. In addition, in animal models, ANAVEX 1-41 prevented the expression of caspase-3, an enzyme that plays a key role in apoptosis (programmed cell death) and loss of cells in the hippocampus, the part of the brain that regulates learning, emotion and memory. These activities involve both muscarinic and sigma-1 receptor systems through a novel mechanism of action. 

They also have a very strong leadership team: 

Dr. Missling, President and CEO of Anavex, has over 20 years of healthcare industry experience within large pharmaceutical companies, the biotech industry and investment banking. Prior to joining Anavex, he served as the Chief Financial Officer of Curis and ImmunoGen. 

Dr. Zografidis, the Vice President Clinical Operations of Anavex, has over 25 years of experience in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry, including 12 years at Wyeth (now Pfizer) in clinical project management and prior to joining Anavex most recently served as clinical and pharmaceutical consultant. 

Bernd Metzner, PhD, a director of Anavex, is currently Chief Financial Officer of the Doehler Group, a global producer and provider of technology-based natural ingredients for the food and beverage industry with sales activities in more than 130 countries. Previously, he was Chief Administration Officer and member of the Board of Management of Bayer Schering Pharma AG, the pharmaceutical division of $100+ billion market cap company Bayer AG. 

Solid pipeline and good leadership. They are also very good at PR, which is a benefit to shareholders in that they are actively trying to spread the word about their pipeline and potential.

These activities involve both muscarinic and sigma-1 receptor systems through a novel mechanism of action. 

They also have a very strong leadership team: 

Dr. Missling, President and CEO of Anavex, has over 20 years of healthcare industry experience within large pharmaceutical companies, the biotech industry and investment banking. Prior to joining Anavex, he served as the Chief Financial Officer of Curis and ImmunoGen. 

Dr. Zografidis, the Vice President Clinical Operations of Anavex, has over 25 years of experience in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry, including 12 years at Wyeth (now Pfizer) in clinical project management and prior to joining Anavex most recently served as clinical and pharmaceutical consultant. 

Bernd Metzner, PhD, a director of Anavex, is currently Chief Financial Officer of the Doehler Group, a global producer and provider of technology-based natural ingredients for the food and beverage industry with sales activities in more than 130 countries. Previously, he was Chief Administration Officer and member of the Board of Management of Bayer Schering Pharma AG, the pharmaceutical division of $100+ billion market cap company Bayer AG. 

Solid pipeline and good leadership. They are also very good at PR, which is a benefit to shareholders in that they are actively trying to spread the word about their pipeline and potential.

15-08-05,3fvi55,Valuation of Tech Stocks,"I'm looking to do a full valuation analysis on a tech company and I was just wondering if anyone had some insight as to the best way to approach it. For reference, the company is The Score Mobile (SCR.V) and for those of you who don't know it is a mobile app that allows users to follow updates in the sporting world, keep track of scores etc etc.

What I am struggling with is the best way to go about valuing the company. They do not pay a dividend so that rules out any dividend based models. As well (and please forgive me if I'm thinking of this the wrong way), their FCFE is negative so I don't think I could use that as any sort of proxy or instrumental variable within a dividend-style model. 

I was thinking of using an asset based approach but quite frankly I'm not sure if that works. Being a tech company, they don't have very much tangible assets so I don't think looking at EV is a fair way to go about doing it. Again, I could be wrong and please tell me I'm an idiot if I am wrong! 

So that leaves me with valuing the company on a per user basis which I'm not exactly sure how to approach (thanks for nothing CFA level 1)

Partnerships are genuinely regular in light of the fact that this is first thing numerous financial specialists consider doing when they begin. They want to discover someone who can put up the cash and deal with them fifty-fifty. This is a choice; however, there are better approaches to make much more.
 
Hard Money Lenders are people or organizations that have money prepared for you to make use of. This is typically an improved option than conventional banks, since it is a better source for getting funds immediately, regardless of the fact that you have a low credit rating. Numerous hard money lenders don't like to loan more than 65% of the reasonable business sector estimation of property, so the valuable the deal, the more opportunities and ways you will have.
 
Private Lenders can be better option as compared to hard money lenders because you can frequently mastermind better terms, since you are dealing somebody personally. Keep in mind, a private money lender can be anybody, even a family member or any close friend. Everyone wins because you are giving them an improved rate of return than they will get in their reserve funds or common stores.

15-08-05,3fvoyx,Warren Buffett vs Thomas Piketty and Long Term Rate of Return on Equities,"Here is a quote from Warren Buffett at the 1999 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting:

&gt; ""53% of the world's stock market value is in the U.S. Well, if U.S. GDP grows at 4-5% a year with 1-2% inflation - which would be a pretty good, in fact it would be a *very* good result - then I think it's very unlikely that corporate profits are going to grow at a greater rate than that. Corporate profits as a percentage of GDP are on the high side already - and corporate profits can't constantly grow at a faster rate than GDP. Obviously, in the end, they'd be greater than GDP.""

So that's what Warren Buffett has to say.

However, I've read a bit of Thomas Piketty's *Capital in the 21st Century* and it seems like the gist of his argument is that the rate of return on capital investment is greater than the rate of growth of GDP.

So are Thomas Piketty and Warren Buffett in disagreement here? Someone please enlighten me. Thanks",14

Any investor I am sure would say  that Apple is a stock that is great for long term and will generally grow with the market.

So My question is why in a a short term period like this would so many people be selling. The more the price drops the more investors want to sell to prevent loss but why would a great company like Apple be causing such a scare to investors. I would understand id this drop happened over a longer period of time. A few months even. But this has all happened the last 2 weeks. 

I look at it as a great time to buy stock to anticipate long term growth? 

I guess I am just confused on what would make someone want to sell a stock like Apple in a sudden drop.

15-08-05,3fwkaw,Aegis Capital Fined for Selling Unregistered Penny Stocks,"www.StockPromoters.com

On Monday, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) fined Aegis Capital Corp. $950,000 for improperly selling unregistered penny stocks and for related supervisory failures, and for failing to implement anti-money laundering (AML) policies and procedures. Aegis is also required to retain an independent consultant to review its supervisory and AML systems and procedures.

In addition, Charles D. Smulevitz and Kevin C. McKenna, who served successively as Chief Compliance and AML Compliance Officers at the time of the violations, agreed to 30- and 60-day principal suspensions, and fines of $5,000 and $10,000, respectively, for their supervisory and AML failures. In a separate proceeding, Robert Eide, Aegis’s President and CEO, was suspended for 15 days and fined $15,000 for failing to disclose more than $640,000 in outstanding liens.

From April 2009 to June 2011, Aegis Capital Corp. liquidated nearly 3.9 billion shares of five penny stocks that were not registered with the SEC and not exempt from registration. There were many “red flags” associated with the transactions, including that the customers were referred to Aegis by a single former securities broker who was barred from the industry and who controlled the activity in several of the Aegis accounts. Without conducting a reasonable inquiry into the red flags, Aegis sold the unregistered shares in violation of the registration requirements of the securities laws.

FINRA’s investigation found that the violations resulted, in part, from the supervisory failures of Aegis and its two Chief Compliance Officers, Smulevitz and McKenna, during the period of the liquidations. Aegis did not have a supervisory system reasonably designed to prevent the distribution of unregistered securities, and further failed to conduct reasonable and meaningful inquiries of the circumstances surrounding the sales of a total of 10 penny stocks by more than a dozen customers.

Additionally, FINRA found that Aegis, as well as Smulevitz and McKenna, as the firm’s AML Compliance Officers, did not adequately implement the firm’s AML program, as they failed to reasonably detect and investigate red flags indicative of potentially suspicious transactions. Specifically, the firm, through Smulevitz and McKenna, did not investigate the deposits of unregistered securities, followed shortly thereafter by liquidations. These sometimes occurred at the same time periods of suspicious promotional activity were undertaken and amounted to large percentages of the daily trading volume, and transfers of the resulting proceeds out of the accounts shortly after the liquidations. These failures evidenced the firm’s inadequate system to detect, investigate and, where appropriate, report suspicious activity to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.

In settling this matter, the respondents neither admitted nor denied the charges, but consented to the entry of FINRA's findings.",0

This is for all you guys commenting and messaging me about how my trades been doing I've been shit on by /r/personalfinance /r/wallstreetbets and many other subs. I even got banned from /r/wallstreetbets for some reason. I was just unbanned because the mods allowed me to make this post for you guys to bask in this yolo.

From my old thread you can see I bought about 85 bitcoins 3 months ago @235 each. Right now those bitcoins are worth $24042 at @282.5 each. I paid the interest only payment each month out of pocket from a bit of money I had before. The interest payment was like $20 a month. So right now I'm sitting at 25% profit on 20,000 Which is $4,000. I was kind of unable to do much the last couple months but that's about to change I'll be diversifying very soon and making my next picks in the crypto 2.0 space and other places.

The Bitcoin market was actually not very volatile compared to what it's usually like in these past 3 months. But I was still able to make a healthy profit of 25%. To put that into perspective in the last 3 months Apples had a loss of -7.6%. I've done 33% better than apple in the last 3 months. 

Stay tuned for my next picks and thanks for reading.

15-08-06,3fybqx,Can I and or how can I estimate and compare potential returns on different portfolio combinations?,"EDIT: does this belong in the daily advice thread? I'm not asking for advice on what to do with my money or how I specifically should invest, just on the mechanics of math and portfolio comparison...

Is it reasonable to estimate returns?

Lets say I estimate:

$1000 per year on bonds at 2.3% return

$5000 per year on index funds at 8% return

$2000 per year on stocks at 12% return

Is it just completely idiotic to estimate and or presume a certain ""general"" or ""grey area"" of percentage return amount like this? I think it's obvious that stocks will have the potential to earn more than bonds, though of course with higher risk, but is it dangerous to estimate like this and how dangerous? Is it only dangerous if I estimate high yields? It seems nearly safe to say that if a person invested money in a reasonable and diversified stock portfolio that that person would make more than 1% per year, even 2% per year. Where's the limit or breaking point? How do I know when to stop increasing that estimate?

If it's idiotic to do this, what would be the correct way to do something like compare portfolios?

I'm thinking real high level like the above example, not really specific funds or indexes or stocks but about the types of instruments in general.

If I want to be accurate must I get extraordinarily verbose and granular with the exact details down to the specific brand/company/exact-stocks I want to estimate holding? That seems like it takes a lot of work, and while I'm willing to put in work like that, I'm also hoping maybe there's a reasonably safe estimate style alternative.

I've heard that it's not uncommon to make 20% or better if you're investing in stocks. Is that likely to be reliably true in the first place? Is it just completely idiotic to estimate and plan based on that kind of yield? I understand I shouldn't ""count my chickens before they hatch"" but it seems like financial planners at e.g. banks or investment firms like Chuck probably have to have some way of showing their clients what they're looking at realistically with various types of investment combinations if given a time period/time range.

Ideally I'd like to have a good toolbox to reasonably create and analyze portfolios for anyone of any age at any income level.

Are there actually any ""general ballpark"" ""safe"" numbers or ranges I could plug in to a spreadsheet to estimate (even very ""conservative"") returns on various investment types?

For example, could I safely say bonds range between 1-3% and thusly make both a ""low"" and a ""high"" estimate  to see what the ""best"" and ""worst"" case scenarios would be for investing X amount in bonds?

Footnote: I feel I'm reasonably competent with math and spreadsheets, so I am sure I can probably handle numerous potential options for making comparisons/estimates/analyses of portfolios and would be able to set up my own formulas for computing stuff - I'm just wondering what's the most reliable/safe/accurate/robust way to go about getting and using this type of data.",2

If an interest payment on an uninsured bond is missed, is the interest payment made when the issuer of the bond recovers? To elaborate: If I hold a junk bond with a company that does not insure its bonds, and the company fails to make a payment to me, will I receive the payment in the future if the company does not go under? Or will that particular payment simply never be made? I assume the former is what will occur, but I could be wrong. Sorry if I'm missing an obvious answer. Thanks!

It seems he expects in the future that he will be able to buy stocks at such a price to give him a greater gain than if he just used that cash to make purchases now.

15-08-06,3fz008,Trollmoney: how China is creating extra money for them to spend,"Courtesy of /u/TheDark1, I think this is worth sharing on how the HELL china went from a dirt-poor third world country to being the biggest spender internationally.

China's debt now is now twice its GDP. That's not even including the bad debt that the big banks use a collateral to issue loans.
I'm really bad at these things, but from what I've been reading, basically the big banks and the Chinese authorities have been pulling the mother of all pyramid schemes. Here's how it works:
The banks are drowning in bad debt (has happened once or twice a decade ever since the opening up). The debt gets shifted to a third party AMC. No write downs occur (the loans are treated as if they are still ""good""). The AMC issues bonds to the value of the debt. Banks assume the bonds with money from the central govt. Now the banks have assets they can use as collateral to issue more loans to the same fucks that didn't repay their last loans!

Wow, finance is easy! Now that 1trillion in debt is actually 1 trillion in assets! When will the assets be realized? Who is the guarantor? Who gives a shit? The party big wigs and their cronies can keep funneling public money into their private graft networks and everyone is either happy or too stupid and cowed to care. Rinse and repeat every five years as necessary!

The only problem is, it only works when china's economy is hermetically sealed. As China tries to expand their influence they are more vulnerable to the ebbs and flows of global capital, and more open to scrutiny.

The time for the correction is coming soon. All those who've invested in China are going to feel like idiots. Meanwhile the moneyed class of China are living happily in Vancouver, Sydney, San Diego, London. The beaten and broken of China will continue as they have these last five thousand years. Penniless and powerless, chattel to the whims of the ones with the whips.",15

15-08-06,3fzii7,Should I invest in oil and gas?,"Hi guys, I'm looking to start investing and as prep I've been doing a bit of research, reading a few books by Peter Lynch, Warren Buffet etc. Now I'm by no means an expert but I have picked up a few investment tips (that admittedly may seem a bit obvious to your more seasoned investor). With a few of these tips being: Invest in what you know, Buy Low Sell High (fairly obvious), High Market Volatility does not equate to High Risk, and diversify your portfolio. 

That being said, these pieces of advice are pointing me in the direction of investing in US oil. At the moment oil and gas is at a record low, with many people saying that from here it will likely go up (and a particular source suggesting that Saudi arabia will even go broke in 2 years http://www.smh.com.au/business/comment-and-analysis/saudi-arabia-may-go-broke-before-the-us-oil-industry-buckles-20150805-gism05?stb=red). Oil is a commodity, and from what I understand has a typically cyclical, volatile price. Do these factors suggest that oil would be a good investment as the cost of a barrel could very well go up in the next few years? 

Furthermore I am an engineer working in the energy industry so I feel I am, generally speaking, in the know about the current market (although I realise this will count for nothing if the market would unexpectedly collapse tomorrow), but as I said before (or rather, Peter Lynch said), Invest in what you know.

A particular company I was thinking of was possibly BP or Chevron, who, despite being predominantly oil and gas, have significant investments in renewable energy, something ExxonMobil somewhat lacks. As well as shell who seems to be selling/withdrawing from many of its renewable projects. So if the price of oil were to drop further, there would at least be some form of redemption. 

Anyway this post was partly to get some genuine advice on investing, and partly as a practice of reading the market. Please bear in mind that I haven't really looked in depth at the companies earnings reports etc. however if anyone could offer me some advice on where I should start looking if I were to deepen my research that would be great?",5

This is the website I have created, still a work in progress but you can see the rooms and the rates, if you are ever looking to rent accommodation near the ruins of Tikal in Northern Guatemala, that is what you’ll get:

 

 Main double room
Main double room
 

 

How to rent your place
First, you have to be ok with the whole concept. I am an avid Couchsurfer and have had dozens of strangers from the internet come stay at my place for the past 10 years, I have also stayed with more people than I can count, and for me a house is made to have people over. I enjoy my private time when people leave, but I also like to host.

If you have many valuables one could break, if you are a cleaning freak, or if you don’t want a stranger around your kids, renting your room or house may not be an option for you.

Even if there are solutions. You can lock your valuables, convert your place into a duplex with separate access for guests to your attic or basement, or do some home exchanges or holiday rentals while you are on holidays yourself.

 

Back to putting your place up for rent. At the moment, we have had a dozen reservations, and over 12 people have stayed with us so far.

 

 

 

 rent guest house tikal

 

 

I rent mainly with Airbnb, and it has been quite easy to manage. I recommend it if you just want to rent a bedroom, or your house while you go on holiday. As we are trying to position as a guest house, I recently registered on Booking as well, and got my first reservation soon after, although Booking doesn’t charge guests so you have to charge them, and since we can’t charge a credit card, the person got scared and cancelled when I asked her to wire the money.

On Airbnb, they charge the guest, keep the money until check-in, then pay you. Both parties are safe.

Airbnb charges the guest 10% admin fee, and 3% to the host, while Booking charges the host 15%.

 

Both sites will work better if you put tons of pictures and descriptions. Be concise, but talk about everything. Is there wifi, a washing machine, a shared kitchen, can people use the fridge, is the bathroom a shower or a tub? etc. And how to get there, if there is public transportation, as many won’t rent a car.

Most people will ask those questions anyway, so putting them in an ad is one way to avoid repeating yourself in an email over and over again.

 

Both sites will require you keep an updated calendar of availability and rates. Make sure you do it and put a note to update it regularly. It will not only help you rank better on their search engine, but also save you time canceling over bookings. Check out the dates of Spring Break, Christmas holidays and other long weekends if you want to raise your rates, or prevent bookings and have your friends over.

 

 

Pros about renting your place
 

Money! Next month, we are going to Miami, and someone booked our house for a full month for $800. That will cover our two flights plus the cost of our staff while we are away. How is that for awesome? Finding a tenant for a whole month in the middle of the Guatemalan jungle that would come exactly while we travel to the US was pretty much a miracle, but you live in a big city, you can rent your place easily when you go away.

 

Offer additional services. I offer to cook diner for them, and barely break even because I am alone tending to 2-4 people, but it is more a public service as there aren’t restaurants nearby. You can offer more expensive meals and make a profit. Big margins are on coffee and drinks. I also offer them to rent my car, hire a driver (which is also a public service, I don’t earn a cent on it, my mechanic does the job and it’s nice to see a nice person who otherwise wouldn’t connect with tourists get part of the tourism money), rent kayaks from my neighbors, take a cooking class in the village, go explore the jungle with my handyman…

Now that I listed them all, I make money on none, but benefit other people so it is still a win for the village. You on the other hand could make extra money offering a cheap room and then charging for those extras. Renting a place for a week to a business person in a big city can get you some dry cleaning, cooking and maybe driving to the airport extras for example.

 

You already have a place. This is easy to set up and requires almost no investment, just clean sheets and towels to start with. As you go, if you enjoy the idea you can buy nicer things and raise your rates. I have even seen people in big cities get bigger apartments and have rentals cover the difference, instead of a full time roommate. You are making money with something you already have, which is pretty awesome.

 

Flexible home exchange. I like the idea of home swaps for the holidays, when you are in NY and want to go to Florida, and find a family who wants to do the opposite, then you swap properties. However, you need to have similar dates, comparable housing options (downtown Manhattan for Miami Beach, suburbs for suburbs, or a bigger house for a better located small one)… And it can get complicated. Renting your place and keeping the money so you can go on holiday is like having a flexible home swap. Once someone has booked your place, and you have the cash, it is much easier to find a holiday option for yourself rather than trying to locate the perfect swap.

 

 

 

Cons about renting your place
 

Lack of privacy. We do not share a bathroom with guests, but have had to when renting in NYC or SF on Airbnb. Still, guests can decide they want to lounge all day and do nothing, and you’ll have them around. No romantic diner, quiet sunset or private life while there are strangers in your air.

 

They take a LOT of time. People are needy, they are in foreign territory, they want to talk, tell you about their day like they are Christopher Columbus, even though you’ve been to the Maya ruins 10 times and heard that very same story 100 times. You’ll be up before they want breakfast, and down after they go to bed, to clean up and wash their dishes.

 

People think you are a travel agency. I am happy to give tips about the region, but when it gets into the minutiae of how they should plan their day, or when they want to exchange 12 emails about their plans in a city 300 miles away, the hourly rate suddenly gets close to minimum wage.

 

Some will expect a full hotel. One couple wanted 4 pillows, towels changed every day… while booking on Airbnb a place described as rustic and in the middle of the jungle. For the luxury jungle lodge you can go pay $300 and up at nearby hotels. You have to set your conditions and be clear. I don’t mind extra towels and pillows, but a) not at 9pm when I want to go to bed and b) I don’t have a washing machine so that means extra hours for the cleaner, and less profit.

 

Being friendly can lead to abuse. When you tell people they can use your drinking fountain, you don’t expect them to fill their half gallon bottle for their day trip (saving $0.5)? They will. They will even take the tank off to get the last drop. Give them coffee mugs and they will go through your personal shelf to grab your personal mug because they like it better. You have to put limits to everything. Where is your space, where is theirs, noise, what can they drink/eat, etc.

 

Plans will change. That same couple (they were a real PITA) cancelled diner on me at 6pm, when all the food was cooked and ready. I tried my hardest to smile and say “no worries” but wanted to strangle them. The following morning, they had asked me to book them a driver and told me at 7am they didn’t want their 9am pick up. The previous day they had hired a driver until 2pm and had him drive 60 more miles than agreed, drop them three hours late at 5pm and just shrugged saying “yeah, you know, we just made a very small detour”, then complained when I asked them for an extra… hold your breath… $12. Those people will eat up your profits.

After learning the hard way, the option is to raise your rates and be at peace with it. People can also cancel 5 days in advance for a full refund on Airbnb so you should consider it side income, don’t count on it to pay your mortgage or your holidays.

 

Some guests are a pain. Like the ones above, we also had a family who forgot an iPad. We weren’t home so the maid found it. I told the guests I would put it in courier for $100. I was ready to go to the post office on my gas and time, but not to bring it with me to Miami so they could get a cheaper rate, as my luggage space is limited and I am not that kind anyway. So they went behind my back, called the maid, who is from Spain, and convinced her to take the iPad to Spain, ship it to a Spanish friend of theirs, so the friend could give it to them (they live in CALIFORNIA!) and they could save on shipping, while not enjoying their iPad for over 2 months.

When people prefer bothering several persons to take care of their personal mess instead of being responsible adults, you can imagine how they will behave in your property. Yes, they did leave with toilet paper too.

 

 

 

 

 

Ok, looks like I needed to vent about the past couple of guests. But… the money has been good and covered our housing expenses and staff for the past three months. Actually, it is my goal this year to make $500 a month with the guest house, for a $5,000 yearly profit ($1,000 would go on cleaning fees and utilities) and cover the cost of the house.

It isn’t much, I just need to rent 7 nights a month to have a free place to myself the rest of the time.

Since November and our first guests, I have made over $1,500 in profit. What I like best is the flexibility you can have to rent just one weekend per year if you’d like, and no more, without much trouble. That is still a grey area legally though, as you are not a hotel, so you need to check if you can operate that kind of business where you live, and how to report your earnings.

 

Is renting your house or a room to tourists something you would consider? If you have, how did it go?",1

Should I be making a Scottrade account or Vanguard account, or just stick to Robinhood and the simple ones? I want to just get a feel for the market while only adding an additional $100 or so per month to my portfolio. 

Is making a Scottrade or Vanguard account going to cost me? I'm in the middle of signing up for a Scottrade account right now and it feels very daunting and I honestly can't understand a lot of the legal/investment jargon they're throwing at me. I just don't want to start getting charged $100s per month because I accidently signed up for some professional account or something.

Should I even have any money in the market right now? Currently I'm just doing it for fun/out of boredom and I don't need these couple hundred dollars very desperately, so I figured it would give me something to keep me busy. Should I pull out the $100 I have sitting in my Robinhood account and read some books about investing or something before I buy any stock? 

Should I look into index funds, penny stocks, or regular stock with my current/future amount of money? Again, only $100-500 for now. Does it make sense to buy a few $50 stocks, or should I buy even less of the bigger, $100 stocks? Should I throw it all into a random index fund; is that even worth it? Or should I just buy a shit tonne of diversified penny stocks? 

I know all these questions have been asked probably a million times, so feel free to just link me to those threads if you want. Thanks so much for your help.

15-08-06,3g0nlu,Miller Energy Execs Charged with Accounting Fraud,"www.StockPromoters.com

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges alleging that Miller Energy Resources Inc. (OTCMKTS: MILL), its former chief financial officer, and its current chief operating officer inflated values of oil and gas properties, resulting in fraudulent financial reports for the Tennessee-based company. The audit team leader at the company’s former independent auditor also was charged in the matter.

The charges allege that after acquiring oil and gas properties in Alaska in late 2009, Miller Energy overstated their value by more than $400 million, boosting the company’s net income and total assets. The allegedly inflated valuation had a significant impact, turning a penny-stock company into one that eventually listed on the New York Stock Exchange, where its stock reached a 2013 high of nearly $9 per share.

Miller Energy paid $2.25 million and assumed certain liabilities to purchase the Alaska properties. It later reported them at a value of $480 million, according to the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. While accounting standards required the company to record the properties at “fair value,” then CFO Paul W. Boyd allegedly relied on a reserve report that did not reflect fair value for the assets, and he also is alleged to have double-counted $110 million of fixed assets already included in the reserve report. 

The report by a petroleum engineering firm allegedly contained expense numbers that were knowingly understated by David M. Hall, the CEO of Miller Energy’s Alaska subsidiary and Miller Energy’s chief operating officer since July 2013. Hall, of Anchorage, Alaska, also is alleged to have altered a second report to make it appear as though it reflected an outside party’s estimate of value.

According to the SEC, the fiscal 2010 audit of Miller Energy’s financial statements was deficient due to the failure of Carlton W. Vogt III, the partner in charge of the audit. Vogt, of Warwick, New York, was then at Sherb &amp; Co LLP, a now defunct firm that was suspended by the SEC in 2013 for conduct unrelated to its work for Miller Energy. Vogt issued an unqualified opinion of Miller Energy’s 2010 annual report and is alleged to have falsely stated that the audit was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and that Miller Energy’s financial statements were presented fairly and conformed with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

“Financial statement information is the cornerstone of investment decisions. We’ve charged that Miller Energy falsified financial statement information and grossly overstated the value of its Alaska assets and that the company’s independent auditor failed to conduct an audit that complied with professional standards,” said William P. Hicks, Associate Regional Director of the SEC’s Atlanta office. “The SEC will aggressively prosecute such conduct.”
    
The SEC’s Division of Enforcement is seeking to obtain cease-and-desist orders, civil monetary penalties, and return of allegedly ill-gotten gains from the company, Boyd, and Hall. It also is seeking to bar Boyd and Hall from serving as public company officers or directors and to bar Boyd and Vogt from public company accounting.

The matter will be scheduled for a public hearing before an administrative law judge for proceedings to adjudicate the Enforcement Division’s allegations and determine what, if any, remedial actions are appropriate.",0

15-08-06,3g01ke,Young investor - portfolio advice for growth and tax efficiency (x-post from /r/personalfinance),"I'm 28, debt free, and just started really saving about 3 years ago. I max out my Roth 401k and my Roth IRA. I also have a HSA, an ESPP account that has RSUs granted from my company, a taxable brokerage, an emergency fund of 8 months, and a savings account that I'm funding for a house. I make too much to contribute to a Roth IRA, so I do the ""backdoor"" conversion immediately from a traditional IRA.

My portfolios are structured as follows:

Roth 401k:

  30% Oppenheimer Int'l Sm Co Fund (OSMYX)

  25% Columbia Mid Cap Index Fund (CPXRX)

  25% Columbia Small Cap Index Fund (CXXRX)

  20% MM S&amp;P 500 Index Fd (MIEZX)

Roth IRA:

AAPL 14%

TSO 14%

HAIN 14%

UA 14%

CYBR 14%

ABBV 14%

NYCB 14%

Taxable:

AMBA 50%

CCL 50%

I don't have much control over fund choices in my 401k, so I tried to choose the funds with the best return compared to expense ratio. My 401k is up roughly 10% YTD based on its poor tracking tools (Mass Mutual). I targeted aggressive growth in my Roth IRA, and overall it's done well with me being up roughly 15% or so. I chose the two stocks in my brokerage for growth as well, however, after reading some boglehead articles I realize I'm not utilizing my taxable account properly.

My financial goal is to be able to retire early and be comfortable, but it's not an expectation I have. I still want to position myself financially to have the best chance of achieving this. I was thinking of selling the stocks in my taxable brokerage (both are up ~10% and would be short term gains) and instead adding the funds VYM, VO, VB, and VIG to leave for long-term. I've seen others recommend VTSAX, and I also know it's advantageous to place international in the taxable accounts. I was also considering either moving to a similar format for my Roth IRA in the coming year with my new contributions, assuming Obama's proposal to eliminate the backdoor conversion doesn't get approved.

What modifications are suggested for my portfolios to allow me to grow my wealth as quickly and intelligently as possible without taking me to the cleaners with taxes?

Thanks!

Fox owns F4, and Disney has hinted before that it wants to add the screen rights of F4 to its Marvel Portfolio.


So 2 scenarios:


1. F4 does better than expected and rocks the box office, with presidential debates as well, these 2 items may drive FOX stock up from its slump and we could see decent Monday earnings.


2. F4 does as bad as its reviews, further tanking FOX, but it may lead to a future deal with Disney about screen rights. At this point it would make no sense for FOX to pursue MARVEL movies (X-men and F4) because Xmen lost its big stars and F4 obviously would have just tanked. If Disney in the next few months was able to strike a deal gaining rights to those properties we MAY see an increase in Disney as well.

15-08-06,3g186k,American Apparel YOLO,"$APP is currently trading at around $.20/share and has been getting shrekt from a spike of $1.14 in December 2014. People have been saying this company is going to go bankrupt for years, but it hasn't.

Dov Charney, the greasy/sleazy/narcissistic joke of a former-CEO has been out since 2014 and a new team, headed by CEO Paula Schneider, is attempting a dramatic turnaround.

The pros and cons of APP as of now:

&amp;nbsp;

**Pros**

* Paula Schneider's two previous gigs were both turnaround efforts. As president of Warnaco (they make swimsuits for Calvin Clein, Speedo, and others), she achieved a 25% increase in direct operating profits in two years. In her next job at sportswear company Big Strike, she increased revenues by 19% from 2010 to 2012.


* They have initiated cost cutting initiatives that aim to shave $30 million. They are closing under-performing stores, laying off employees, and increasing efficiencies in operations, which were a major problem under Charney's reign.


* They plan to de-emphasize the hyper-sexual marketing of years past to attract a broader audience.


* Revenue of $600m/year (though declining).


* They are launching a new fall line, something they haven't done in the past. 


* CEO Schneider has indicated they plan on aggressively expanding their online sales (which have only accounted for 10-15% of sales in the past wtf) and wholesale operations.


* She has also indicated they plan to be more diligent and responsive in adding, expanding, and removing product lines depending on success indicators.


* Hedge Fund Standard General is now the major backer and shareholder in the company, meaning a sale of the company after an aggressive near-term turnaround effort could happen in the future.


* Strong brand recognition (for better or worse).


* It's only $.20/share.

* Charney is no longer steering the ship, and there has been an inflow of new management with no emotion to muddy decision-making. This new team has one objective: to turn this turd around.

&amp;nbsp;

**Cons**

* Severe liquidity issues. The company has a $13.9m interest payment looming and recorded a net loss of $25.4m for 1Q2015. It has a $50m asset-backed revolving credit facility from Capital One that it has used $35m of. Standard General has indicated it may buy this debt in the next few months.


* Charney is initiating a scorched-earth legal battle against his former company and has filed more than 20 lawsuits since being ousted. Most see these challenges as baseless, but lawsuits cost money, and APP doesn't have much of that at the moment.


* You don't believe in APP's made-in-America, sweatshop-free, vertically-integrated model and believe cheap fast-fashion will continue to dominate the apparel landscape. Can APP evolve their business model, broaden their customer base, and maximize efficiencies to become relevant again?


* The money that American Apparel has said it has access to in order to remain operational for the next year dries up without signs of any significant positive changes in cash flow or future outlook.


* The changes in their product offering being rolled out in the next few quarters fail to impress.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't currently have a stake in the company, but have been watching the circus from the sidelines over the past year and have become intrigued as the stock has plummeted to $.20. Indicators such as dropped lawsuits, successful cost-cutting, new financing, and realization of recently-initiated efficiency measures could cause this thing to pop for a nice short-term gain. A buyout is also possible. Having said all of that, there are severe issues facing APP and the future looks bleak, even for successful apparel companies.

If you throw a few thousand at this pile of dog shit, you could end up with some seizure-inducing YOLO gains or watch your money spontaneously combust in an explosion of cheap glitter, spandex, and vomit.

15-08-06,3g0tnd,A Detailed Look At $GOOG,"Google (NASDAQ:[GOOG](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=GOOG)) ([GOOGL](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=GOOGL)) continued its strong performance in the [second quarter](investor.google.com/earnings/2015/Q2_google_earnings.html) of 2015. Highlights in the period included double-digit growth in revenues, cash flows, and earnings. The firm has tremendous flexibility, as it boasts over $70 billion in cash and has only ~$5 billion in debt. We think the company is gearing up for potential buybacks, which we would view as value-creating (in light of its price-fair-value-ratio), or even a dividend, arguably following in Apple's ([AAPL](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AAPL)) footsteps. Perhaps more exciting is that the company is focusing its efforts on cost management, which means economic returns are looking to rise..

Though revenue has been growing consistently, that growth has come under pressure, but more due to the law of large numbers than anything else. In 2014, revenue increased 19% year-over-year, down from 21% in 2013, and down from 22% in 2012, but as the company's revenue base grows, an accelerating pace of revenue expansion becomes more difficult. Constant-currency revenue growth was 18% in the second quarter, and many firms would give anything for that pace of expansion.

The best may still be ahead for Google. According to the second-quarter [earnings call transcript](seekingalpha.com/article/3332585-googles-goog-management-discusses-on-q2-2015-results-earnings-call-transcript?page=2), YouTube watch time rose more than 60% on a year-over-year basis in the quarter, its fastest growth rate in two years! What's more impressive is the jump in mobile activity. Mobile watch time on YouTube more than doubled from the prior year's period, a positive sign as the Internet becomes increasingly mobile focused. Also, the number of advertisers on YouTube rose over 40% year-over-year and the average spend per advertiser is up 60% year-over-year, supplementing the 11% growth in Google's advertising revenue.

It's probably not surprising Google's stock price has reached 52-week highs following the release of the firm's second quarter earnings. We've been pounding the table on shares (see [here](seekingalpha.com/article/2520865-why-google-has-upside-to-800-plus-per-share), [here](seekingalpha.com/article/2326125-google-one-of-the-best-values-in-this-overheated-market), [here](seekingalpha.com/article/2165243-why-google-has-upside-to-nearly-650), [here](seekingalpha.com/article/1923781-why-google-continues-to-have-significant-upside)). What was our differentiated insight? A rigorous focus on the free cash flow and the balance sheet. Though many investors like to dismiss valuation, and we respect that, if performed correctly, it can uncover some of the best insights out there. Let's take a look at Google's other investment considerations and derive our fair value estimate for shares.

**Investment Highlights**

• Once known exclusively for its search dominance, which it maintains, Google has become a tech company focused on a number of things: social, Android, ads, YouTube, Chrome, and research. We think the company will have some megahits in the years ahead, and shares are worth well over $600 each.

• Google is a holding in the portfolio of the Best Ideas Newsletter. We like its valuation, growth potential, cash-flow generation and competitive profile. Very few firms are more attractive on a fundamental basis.

• Google continues to grow revenue at a healthy pace. The firm is pleased with the momentum it is seeing from its mobile division, particularly within mobile advertising. The mobile Internet space will be key for the company moving forward, but Facebook and Twitter are not backing down.

• Google has a strong future in search-both on the desktop and via mobile devices. The company recently sold Motorola Mobility, a value-creating move as it can now allocate more capital to high-return opportunities or new concepts such as self-driving cars, Glass, Fiber, or other innovative ideas.

• Google has three different stock classes with two different tickers. GOOG represents Class A stock, and GOOGL represents the non-voting Class C stock that was created by a stock split in 2014 in order for Google founders to maintain majority control.

**Economic Profit Analysis**

From our point of view, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Google's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 61.6%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 11.7%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT.

**Cash Flow Analysis**

Firms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Google's free cash flow margin has averaged about 20.1% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG.

The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Google, cash flow from operations increased about 34% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 235% over the same time period.

In the second quarter of 2015, Google reported cash from operations of ~$7 billion and capital expenditures of ~$2.5 billion, resulting in free cash flow of ~$4.5 billion in the quarter.

**Valuation Analysis**

This is the section you've been searching for, the culmination of our analysis. Below we outline our valuation assumptions and derive a fair value estimate for shares. Our discounted cash flow model indicates that Google's shares are worth between $543-$815 each. Our next modeling update will likely result in a fair value revision closer to $800 per share in light of the firm's quarterly results. A fair value range is paramount to an assessment in valuation, and why we were able to make the call on Google's undervalued shares.

At present, our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 16% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 9.6%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 28.8%, which is above Google's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 5.4% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Google, we use a 11.7% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows. Follow us for our next update.

Wrapping Things Up

We think Google is a fantastic company.

We've been big fans for some time now, and we love the company's renewed focus on expense management. Its growth potential is not going away anytime soon, and the firm will continue to be a Internet powerhouse as consumers shift to a increasingly more mobile-based Internet.

As the power of the Internet expands, Google with have its hand in the growth. Ongoing innovation should create a suite of products in the future that are even more advanced that those on the present horizon. What those products might be offers a unique case of upside potential, a dynamic that few companies truly have. Google is on the right track.

The company has been one of the best performers in the Best Ideas Newsletter portfolio. Google currently registers a 4 on the Valuentum Buying Index.

15-08-06,3g1dif,"Why Greece Lender's Need to Suffer","Great article in NYT Magazine this week on the Euro/Greece crisis. Lots of times in this sub (though not nearly as bad as in /r/finance) the crux of the argument usually boils down to ""they shouldn't have issued bonds that they couldn't pay."" Maybe for pre-2009, this line has merit. But what about since then, when everyone knew the quagmire that was the Greek political economy? Sort of the equivalent to people who blame the 07-08 financial crisis on poor people taking out mortgages they couldn't afford, rather than the professional bankers approving the NINJA loans. [The choice piece from this article:](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/magazine/why-greeces-lenders-need-to-suffer.html)

&gt; On that day in 2009 [Antacular's note: a Greek government bond **auction**] when GR0133004177 was issued, **investors had every reason to assume that this was an especially risky loan.** The Greek government wanted 7 billion euros, or $10.5 billion, which would not be paid back in full until 2026. **These were all sophisticated investors,** who were expected to think very carefully about the number they typed, because that number had to reflect their belief in the Greek government’s ability to continually pay its debts for the next 17 years. I was shocked, looking back, to see **the winning number: *5.3 percent*.** That is a very low interest rate, **only a couple of percentage points above the rate at which Germany, Europe’s most creditworthy nation, was borrowing money.** This was a rate that **expressed a near certainty that Greece would never miss a payment.**


&gt; In hindsight, of course, we know that the investors should not have lent Greece anything at all, or, if they did, should have demanded something like 100 percent interest. But this is not a case of retrospective genius. **At the time, investors had all the information they needed to make a smarter decision.**... **Just *three weeks* earlier**, a newly elected Greek prime minister revealed that the previous government had scrupulously hidden billions of dollars in debt from the rest of the world. In fact, the new leader revealed, Greece owed considerably more money than the size of its entire annual economy....


&gt; The original sin of the Greek crisis did not happen in Athens. **It happened on those computer terminals, in Frankfurt and London and Shanghai and New York.** Yes, the Greeks took the money. But if I offered you €7 billion at 5.3 percent interest, you would probably take the money, too. ***I* would be the one who looked nuts.**

The expense ratios on the funds I currently have seem really high to me and I’m hoping to reallocate them to reduce unnecessary expenses.  I am fairly new to investing and would appreciate any advice you guys can offer me. This is the first time I am taking an active role in my investments and it’s kind of scary.

**Here is what I’m currently considering for my 401(k):**

*10% in Vanguard Balanced Index Adm / ER: 0.09%*

*30% in Victory Munder Index 500 A / ER: 0.58%*

*20% in MainStay Large Cap Growth I / ER: 0.74%* 

*40% in RidgeWorth Md-Cp Val Eq I / ER: 1.10%* 

Does this look like a good portfolio for high risk tolerance? Am I overlapping anywhere? Am I allocating too much to mid-cap?

#2) Now for the fun part – my Roth IRA is currently with Edward Jones. After learning about personal finance and Bogleheads over the past few months, I am planning to switch to Vanguard but want to have a solid plan before I make that leap. 

Here is my current asset allocation at EJ:

*AMERICAN MUTUAL FUND CL A (AMRMX) – 50%* 

*NEW PERSPECTIVE FUND CL A (ANWPX) – 40%* 

*SMALLCAP WORLD FUND CL A (SMCWX) – 10%*

My EJ funds have been performing pretty well so I was thinking I would try to replicate the portfolio, just with vanguard funds. Do you have any advice on how best to do this or am I going about it the wrong way?

Again, thanks to anyone who took the time to read this and offer me advice. ",1
15-08-06,3g1zt2,Actively managed retirement portfolio vs. diversified collection of index funds,"Many years ago I took the advice I read about on the Motley Fool regarding a retirement investment strategy.  It boiled down to ""put your money in an S&amp;P 500 index fund, assuming you are many years from retirement (I was in my 20s at the time).""  I did that for 15 years or so and frankly never even followed the market ups and downs since I wasn't touching the money anyway.  In down markets my contributions bought more than in up markets.  Three years ago an Edward Jones rep convinced me to move a significant chunk of my retirement investments into an actively managed type of fund called Advisory Solutions.  It has only been three years but those investments have never come close to beating my previous, very simple strategy of investing in an S&amp;P 500 Index fund.  I've scheduled a meeting with my Edward Jones rep to review the past three years and to contrast my results with ""what if"" I had stayed my previous course.  In advance of our meeting he sent me [this](https://www.edwardjones.com/groups/ejw_content/@ejw/@us/@graphics/documents/web_content/web223826.pdf) write up which is basically making the case that I should not be comparing my results to indexes.  Strikes me as fishy.  In reading through it none of the arguments put forth resonate with me but I'm interested in getting feedback from y'all.  Bear in mind that I am 20+ years from retirement.",0

I'm new to investing and have done some research around this thread in particular. I am aiming to go with a basic three fund ETF portfolio leaning towards Vanguard funds (VTI, VXUS, BND) for starters as suggested in other topics. I have about $5k that I am willing to put in for this and wanted to know is this an appropriate amount? I read as for mutual funds that it requires a minimum, where as for ETFs the Expense ratio is lower so it is more preferable. Anyone have a portfolio similar to what I am looking to build? I also have an account with my brokerage (Ameritrade). If i look into Vanguard ETFs should I open a Vanguard account or should I go through my current Ameritrade to manage this portfolio?

15-08-07,3g2pb8,Possible To Put 100% Toward 401(k)? What Would Taxes Look Like?,"I tried to put 100% of my income toward my 401(k) to try to max it out for 2015 since I just turned eligible to take advantage of that from my company and I have enough money in savings to be comfortable for at least a year.

My company told me that I would be charged since there are some taxes, Medicare, and Social Security I would have to pay.

How are some people able to submit 100%? How would it affect taxes once they come around?

EDIT: I may have worded this wrongly, better to make a summary:

* I have enough cash savings to last me a year
* My 401k eligibility starts this month (August)
* I recently got hired so I want to max out for 2015
* If I put 100% I would be around 17k by the end of this year. So I would not make it to max but close to it.
* My question was, how putting most of your income into 401k would affect once tax season comes around? How would 100% look like, IF that is a viable option.",36

What to do with the remainder of my portfolio?,"I've made a series of poor decisions investing in the stock market and after 10 years am getting out of it completely. Most of what I had was decimated from margin calls from the oil crash at the beginning of this year but still have eight stock holdings left, between 100-200 shares each with a total account value of ~$3000. All of these stocks except one are tanking and probably will never recover. The only one not tanking has barely gone up at all.

Initially I was thinking I would sell off a portion of them each year to pay less in taxes but I'm really not too clear on how that works. It's my preference to liquidate what little I have left (everything) and close my stock account just to put everything behind me and move on; wanted advice from others before doing that though.

Edit: What I'd really like to know is whether or not I'd be paying less in taxes if I sell off little by little each year. I would really like to sell everything and be done with it but if I'm going to be paying significantly more in taxes I'll sell off gradually.",0

15-08-07,3g4ru8,New CEO Rule Excludes Small-Cap and Emerging Growth Companies,"www.StockPromoters.com

On Wednesday, the SEC adopted a final rule that requires a public company to disclose the ratio of the compensation of its chief executive officer (CEO) to the median compensation of its employees. The new rule, mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, provides companies with flexibility in calculating this pay ratio, and helps inform shareholders when voting on “say on pay.”
 
“The Commission adopted a carefully calibrated pay ratio disclosure rule that carries out a statutory mandate,” said SEC Chair Mary Jo White. “The rule provides companies with substantial flexibility in determining the pay ratio, while remaining true to the statutory requirements.”

The new rule will provide shareholders with information they can use to evaluate a CEO’s compensation, and will require disclosure of the pay ratio in registration statements, proxy and information statements, and annual reports that call for executive compensation disclosure.  Companies will be required to provide disclosure of their pay ratios for their first fiscal year beginning on or after Jan. 1, 2017. 

The rule addresses concerns about the costs of compliance by providing companies with flexibility in meeting the rule’s requirements. For example, a company will be permitted to select its methodology for identifying its median employee and that employee’s compensation, including through statistical sampling of its employee population or other reasonable methods. The rule also permits companies to make the median employee determination only once every three years and to choose a determination date within the last three months of a company’s fiscal year. In addition, the rule allows companies to exclude non-U.S. employees from countries in which data privacy laws or regulations make companies unable to comply with the rule and provides a de minimis exemption for non-U.S. employees.

The rule does not apply to smaller reporting companies, emerging growth companies, foreign private issuers, MJDS filers, or registered investment companies. The rule does provide transition periods for new companies, companies engaging in business combinations or acquisitions, and companies that cease to be smaller reporting companies or emerging growth companies.

A crazed looking man with a deep scar on his face drinks Cuban coffee with an alarmingly thin woman toting a large beaten suitcase and a mangy dog. Next to them, two 50-somethings downing Bloody Mary’s talking loudly about how much they love it here, and how the heat isn’t bothering them one bit.

The waiter asks them if they’d like another. They oblige. “And some ice water please.” Their sunburned skin and Hawaiian shirts give them away. They’re some of the last straggler tourists in town this morning, at least ones that are awake. The few others are still asleep/passed-out after a long night of performing their best Ernest Hemmingway impressions. Apparently, Hemmingway drank here, there and everywhere. At least that’s what the marketing materials tell us.

The man with the scarred face pays his tab in cash and slithers away down the alley alongside me. His companion packs up her bags, leashes her dog to the sad looking suitcase and heads in the other direction.

It’s August, and the town is for locals now, just as we like it. The next three months belong to the artists, the drifters and the crazies. I’m not sure which category I fit into yet. I sure as hell can’t paint.

As I sip my café con leche, I’m looking over the data from yesterday’s markets. It’s no wonder why I haven’t seen any sign-spinners begging to buy my gold. Gold’s in the proverbial shitter.

Like any bubble, you can literally see the peak when Joe-Schmoe on the corner is hawking the latest fad (beware vape shop owners).

We Buy Gold! We Pay The Most!

But only the diehards are still buying. Somehow paying the rent on their pop-up kiosks as gold continues to slide. There have been fewer and fewer sign-spinners offering to take precious metals off our hands.

This may actually signal a buying opportunity. I should ask the flower shirted tourist couple what they think. They’re buzzed enough on booze and coffee to give an honest opinion, that’s for certain.

5-year-Gold

Gold hasn’t traded this low in years. But the market isn’t selling off on the “recovering economy” but rather fearing an interest rate hike and accounting for the global mess out there. Everyone from Anchorage to Zurich is buying US dollars, driving gold lower.

Of course, once gold is “cheap” enough, and the dollar too strong, the smart ones will jump back into yellow metal and abandon the dollar… imagine a sign-spinner displaying “we buy cash.” If you see that, get out of the dollar asap.

This scenario (less the sign-spinner) may occur sooner, rather than later. Gold, the dollar index, US dollar ETF’s and the stock market have already priced the likelihood a Fed hike in. But, if it’s raised a just quarter point, rather than some drastic move, gold could begin to rise once again.

No matter what you hear, read or see, money has to remain cheap or the fragile economy will falter. It’s the illusion of strength that matters to our government, not the facts. And Uncle Sam loves his printing press. He can’t pay his debts without it.

The Fed will show their cards with a quarter point hike. The market will cheer; stocks will jump and soon after gold will follow. Those in dollars will realize it’s over printed and overvalued. Buying the dollar now may in fact be a top.

There’s no turning back with a rate hike, the Fed can’t raise rates too high only to roll them back later on. So it has to be either small, or fatal. The street is patiently waiting for Yellen to make her call this September. Bet on something very small, if anything at all.

The two tourists have paid their bill in cash and wobbled out. The only ones left are my waiter and I.

He’s a 20-something kid who has likely seen more oddities in his short Key West life than Robert Ripley could have dreamed of. He’s wearing a gold chain with some sort of silver coin attached, much like the ones sold in the gift shops near the Mel Fisher treasure museum. Even those shops aren’t too hip on buying gold. They’ll sure sell you some though.

Tomorrow we head offshore to the Gulf Stream to do our best Hemmingway impression. Apparently, his other hobby was fishing.

“Yesterday’s the past, tomorrow’s the future, but today is a gift. That’s why it’s called the present.”

I am holding a couple of thousands of these for the last few days and apart from the daily variation (lets say loosing 5 cents/ day X number of UWTI stocks) I've not seen any fees wiping off my portfolio so what's the downside of holding it till it goes over the price I paid for them?",3
15-08-07,3g51hh,"LL Analysis - good, bad or indifferent?","Eating my humble pie here, I took a nibble on Lumber Liquidator (LL) back around $24 and obviously have taken a bath since.

If you've not been following the news, they had ""bad"" Q2 results (not shocking) and dropped another ~20% this week. Here's why I'm thinking about taking the plunge.

So evaluation is tricky...

This year's earnings are a crap shoot. Estimates anywhere from .01/share to .60/share which puts the current P/E anywhere from 120 to 20. Even 20 would seem high given the circumstances but this year is likely an anomaly with estimates for 2016 being back up in the $1.00-1.80 range. Current P/E with the 2016 estimates are in the 12 to 6 range.... fire sale prices right??? HD = 24. LOW = 25.

So next question is, are 2016 estimates worth a damn? Will they survive long enough for the theoretical recovery? Their Q2 results that just came out show sales down about 16MM or 6%. They got destroyed on the market for these results. To me, that's a fricking touchdown if I'm running LL. After all of this continued bad press for the last 6 months, the top line dropped 6%. And that drop is likely due to deep discounts to keep people walking through the doors. Now net profits dropped at a much steeper rate for the same reason which is more worrisome but still. The first quarter, likely to be the worst quarter since the controversy broke saw only a 6% decline in sales. 

Ok, but what about the impending fines from the feds and/or civil litigation. The federal investigation involves the Lacey act. The last instance of a fine I could find online was Gibson guitars to the tune of $300k. LL has put on the books an expected liability of $10MM and another $3MM in inventory forfeiture. Chump change for a billion dollar a year organization. The civil law suits gets more interesting... the more I read the more it sounds like this formaldehyde testing is a complete hoax. ie No agreed upon testing standards no way to prove damages and no consensus from ""experts"" about accepted safe levels. While this doesn't prevent lawsuits from being the final nail in the coffin I'm beginning to get the impression this will end with the option of replacing some laminate flooring. 

Lastly, financial statements... do they have a cash flow crisis? Can the weather the storm? Gets a little fuzzy. They have 45MM in cash compared to 58MM accounts payable. Seems bad at first. But that's actually an improvement compared to the beginning of the year, which was a 20MM/80MM ratio. And add to that psudo-quick ratio an inventory worth 262MM (think that includes the bad inventory but that only accounts for 3% is my understanding.

At the end of the day, total assets of 481MM minus total liabilities of 177MM = 304MM divided by 27.1MM outstanding shares = $11.21 per share. At $12/share that's almost a 1:1 ratio. Insane right???

SO, I should ""Not throw good money after bad"" OR  ""be greedy when others are fearful""

15-08-07,3g5mx6,Volatility ETF Bang,"Dear WSB,

With the Vol ETFs priced off of the VIX Term Structure, how would this affect certain Vol ETFs with a shift from current contango to backwardation come a volatile market crash?

From this statement, which ETF (if I bought today as a buy and hold) would give me my best bang for my buck wanting Vol to skyrocket? 

I see a lot of the long leveraged Vol ETFs are being screwed not only on the contango roll but also on the decay so this kind of risk I'm trying to avoid.

Long ETFs like VIIX and VXX are point in case whereby if you look at a long term chart it's almost like you've fallen down a mountain. What a waste.

Short ETFs like UVXY act almost exactly like the longs -- absolutely creamed. When there's an economic event I can't see this one rising more than 400%, which for all downward pressure you have on the decay I'm not sure if it's worth it.

Last scenario: what would happen to ETFs like XIV, ZIV and XVXY if the contango changed to backwardation in the Term Structure because the equities devalue considerably (say 50%) and then after a time we stabilise and we launch back into a bull market?

15-08-07,3g6ufi,YOLOing on Kazakhstan: Frontier Market ETFs in 2015,"I'm super pumped. Seriously. I just started my '96 Camaro, cranked [Van Halen's Panama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-NshzYK9y0) to 11, and gunned the engine in the driveway until the song was over.

Why am I so amped? I just found out I can invest in Nigerian Breweries, the national beer company of Nigeria. Even a coup d'état would keep those doors open. In fact, there is a whole host of fringe economies I can invest in via Frontier Market ETFs, available through funds like iShares [$FM](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239649/ishares-msci-frontier-100-etf) or Guggenheim's [$FRN](http://guggenheiminvestments.com/products/etf/frn).

Top holdings include some tasty risk like the top gas companies in Pakistan and the top banks in Kazakhstan. We're talking huge upside here. While the American economy has enjoyed its bull market, global Emerging Markets (within which Frontier Markets is the runt of the litter) have grown very little. They remain at pretty much [the same level as they were in 2007](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=EEM+Interactive#{%22range%22:%225y%22,%22allowChartStacking%22:true}). When the asset class finally explodes upward, Frontier Market ETFs like $FM are likely to experience 2-3X their gains.

15-08-07,3g5gk8,"Taxes - big gains in market, but how to avoid underpayment penalty?","Here's a situation I was made aware of... hoping someone can elaborate

~~

For example, scenario 1: bob does a normal job (eg 40k/yr), pays normal taxes, usually get a refund.

For tax year 2014, bob does really well in the markets (maybe yolo wallstreetbets) and pulls in an unexpected 15k in short term realized gains.

[http://www.irs.gov/publications/p505/ch04.html](http://www.irs.gov/publications/p505/ch04.html)

My understanding from reading the above, is that for tax year 2014 bob does not have a penalty since his timely withholdings was at least as much and within $1000 of his 2013 tax obligation.  bob just has to pay the additional taxes he owes on the 15k when he files at the end of the year.

&amp;nbsp;


scenario 2: bob gets lucky again in 2015 and pulls in another 15k while working a 40k/yr salary job.


My understanding in scenario 2 is that bob IS subject to penalties because his normal withholding was not within the taxes owed in 2014.

&amp;nbsp;

What does bob have to do to avoid an underpayment of tax penalty and just square everything properly away with uncle sam?

&amp;nbsp;

added: If bob have a lifetime investment losses (eg 20k), can he apply some or all of it to offset any year's investment income? 
what is the underpayment penalty in these cases?

A bit about me... I'm 30 years old, no loans/mortgage/debt, $120K annual salary, have $18K saved up in a money market savings account, and no other investments. My company matches up to 4% of my contribution so I've only contributed 4% of my salary. We can contribute up to 10% max into company stock. Please feel free to ask if you need more information from me.

The various indices and stock options are listed below. We have to distribute in increments of 1% and it must total 100%. Thanks so much in advance for your input.

15-08-07,3g658g,Is there a lot of risk in selling covered puts in stocks you want a long stake in?,Is there a downside in selling covered puts in stocks you want a long stake in? Say I am bullish on Apple. But I don’t want to buy in at 115. I really would love it at 105. I sell puts at 105 for September and get a credit of 1.40. If it doesn’t go down to 105 I keep the 1.40. If it does go down to 105 I just bought stock in a company I wanted to invest in anyway at $103.60 (105-1.40).  The downside I see is that someone else is shorting on my dime forcing me to buy a stock that could be on a further decline.

15-08-08,3g7got,Selling Puts then Long the Underlying?,"Hey all,

Options noob here, but I think I found a play that I am interested in.

I am a buy and hold fundamental investor. Just yesterday I started a position in Snap-on Inc (SNA) and believe they will be a long term winner. As more cash frees up in my portfolio I would love to add more here.

After browsing the options for a bit I noticed a put with a high premium. There is a March 2016 $170 put selling for $12. 

What if I sold that put, then took the cash proceeds and invested straight into the stock?

Snap-on has been raising its dividend around 10-20% per year along with delivering 15% EPS growth on average. 

If I sold the put today, and the stock got put on me, it would have a cost basis of 158 (170-12) which is less than $166 today. Not to mention, this is only 3% growth in 6 months. This seems totally feasible. 

My question is, what are the risks of doing this? I already know I am comfortable at owning this company at this price. It seems like a win win to me.

Well, that took care of my 'too much free time' problem. In the first thread, 10 companies were selected, the list can be viewed in the old post, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3fk5u9/i_have_time_to_kill_what_stock_do_you_want_valued/). 

The results are structured such that the table below has the summary results and each of the company names links to a comment in this post which contains details on my biases, how I went about valuing the company, the assumptions I made, the sources of information and a link to the spreadsheet model. 

Because my own models are messy and built to my idiosyncrasies, I transcribed the numbers into valuation spreadsheets from Damodaran's website. Those sheets are a bundle of interconnected things so please be careful and read the comments in each cell before you start changing things.

15-08-08,3g7z0z,Risk vs reward in the current market. My situation and a question.,"I just recently entered the market in February. I invested against my emotions, that we are currently topped out in the market. I understand the idea that you should not try and time the market.

Since February I have put in $30,000 into a Vanguard account with a 70/30 Stock Bonds split, weighted about the same in regard to US vs International. I feel I am well diversified. My only debt is a car payment, I'm 33 with a stable decent paying job.

My question is this. In a U.S. market that has thus far performed flat this year...Is the *return* of a very optimistic 7 to 8% worth the risk of liquidizing for the next 12 months to wait out the result of the Fed rate hike and stabilization of the International market for good or bad?

Right now my investments are break even. I feel that even *experts* can't seem to come to a consensus about the current market. Even though this feels like a giant post trying to legitimize the timing of the stock market, I can't help but feel waiting on the outside may be worth the **generous** assumption that I might make $2100 (which seems highly unlikely right now) in the next 12 months.

It's the weekend, time to think. Give me some feedback. Be brutal if necessary, I don't care. Thank you.",3

But, currently priced at 5.28/share, with a NAV of 5.91/share (as of 8/7), it seems like it is currently undervalued.

Plus, as of this morning, the board has opted to continue the 7 cent monthly dividend, giving an annual dividend yield of ~15%.

On the same time, gold, oil, and most of their sectors seem to be hurting, which could spell continued trouble.

15-08-08,3g8woz,$TPIV action this week.,"I'm seeing some social mentions on $TPIV in the last few days and its on WSB's radar.   The stock jumped 10% Friday as JBEM and friends positioned into the stock.   /u/resumeblank DD is easy enough to find if you search this board.

The timing of the recent moves may just indicate that its time for TPIV to start hitting its catalysts.   However its just as likely this stock is being positioned as a pump and dump.   All I can say right now is that you will likely be hearing about $TPIV this week.

If I had free funds, I'd be moving some into $TPIV however I'd have a serious stop around 25% gains because I've been burned by jbem stocks in the past.   

$TPIV is a good long term stock but unless there's an actual catalyst upcoming that I don't see, there's nothing to keep the stock price higher once jbem and friends leave, and that is key -- jbem is a firm believer in locking in profits, and you should be as well.   Further, he announces his exits, probably associated with shorts, so when he leaves a position it invariably plummets.

Do your own DD and be careful with this one.",20

http://fortune.com/2015/06/11/vanguard-blackrock-could-beat-peltz-icahn/

These groups have more pull than ever due to the cultural shift to index investing. And because they invest in the whole market they have very different incentives than active managers (cf. recent stories about anti-competitive behavior caused by companies having the same shareholders). What do you think the long term effects will be?

And in the short term, do these social trends indicate an investment opportunity in financial service companies like BlackRock?

15-08-08,3gah4g,15 and new to Investing. I want to save money through school for college.,"So I'm 15 and have recently gotten a job at a local restaurant which I know is a stable job.

15-08-09,3gc2ne,Vanguard via SmartShares or ASX in New Zealand?,"Hi all, I'm down with the basic ETF / Vanguard style advice in general, but being in NZ my options are a little different. Does anyone here have experience to offer here?

One option is to invest in the Vanguard funds available on the Australian market. This will incur foreign exchange costs as well as brokerage fees and currency variations. I am unclear on what exactly the tax implications are other than to say they are more complex than anything local. In return you get the low ongoing fees. E.g.  
https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/investments/etfdetailVTS.jsp  

The other option I am looking at is via SmartShares who provide ETF funds locally in NZ and are expanding the funds they are making available. This is a simpler option and the costs are clear and predictable but in return they are adding 0.3% on top of whatever fees the underlying fund is charging. This does still seem better compared to other managed funds I've looked at in New Zealand. E.g.  
http://smartshares.co.nz/types-of-funds/smartlarge/us-500

Quick context: To begin with I have approx $10k NZD sitting in savings (3.9%) to put in and will be adding to that regularly. KiwiSaver employer matching is maxed out. No debt and am renting. I haven't decided what sort of split I want between local, offshore and other investment forms I want yet. I am mid 30's aiming to set up an early retirement in 15 years.

15-08-09,3gc9yh,College student seeking advice on the stock market?,"Hi everyone, so I'm about to be 20 years old (rising junior) and I'm really thinking hard about putting my money in the stock market. I just finished up an internship and I actually made a decent amount of money. I'm thinking of saving about $4,500 and doing nothing with that (I'm not much of a risk taker and I need it to pay rent for school) and then putting about $2,500 in the market with my internship money. I want to put $2,000 into a stable stock and then play around with $500 with stocks that are like $30-$40. If I lose that $500 then that's on me, but at least I'll learn something.

Would you guys advise this for me? I want to start early and learn to be prepared for the future. I'm not looking to get rich quick, but having patience so in 5-10 years I won't have to worry about money as much.

The stock where I'm going to put all of my $2000 in is going to be Dominion Resources. I could acquire about 27 shares right now at $72.34 and I just know this stock will go up in a few years. I'm not even going to monitor this stock because in 1-2 years, I know it'll be over $100 per share. It's such a stable utility company and with the projects they are doing, there is no way it can go down much. This will require me to have a lot of patience, but I'm going to keep this stock for a long time.

With my other $500, I really don't know what to invest in. I can only invest in 1 stock here because the fees will kill me, so I need something in the $30-40 range. I was thinking fitbit, but I'm not sure. I know it just went down, but everyone is always trying to lose weight and that's all they talk about at my workplace, so I think there's a chance it'll go up again. I'm not going to invest in penny stocks because to me it seems like it does more harm then good. So I'll probably have to research a little more here. With the money here, I'm probably going to trade every few weeks.

Also, how do dividends work? Just take for example the $2000 for Dominion Resources. Will I be payed a certain percentage every quarter? If so, how much?

Do you guys have any other advice for me? Or does it look like I'm on the right track? I signed up for etrade a couple days ago and I should be ready to buy stocks soon. I've been trying to look at stock trends with 3 month and 1 year averages and I'm just scared to pull the trigger on a certain stock.

Thanks guys!

15-08-09,3gcjtt,"Let's take a look at Bakkafrost (my third analysis)"," **Bullet points**

 Financially solid salmon producer with strong management in place

 Good and sustainable dividend yield (currently yielding ~3%) 

 Several potential catalysts in place

 Upside of 20% based on DAOE model

 **Bakkafrost**

 Bakkafrost is a Faroese salmon producer listed on the Millennium Oslo Stock Exchange (from here on “OSE”). It trades on the US OTC board under the ticker ”BKFKF”. Bakkafrost is the largest and only public traded salmon producer on the Faroe Islands and offers a wide range of different salmon products including whole, gutted salmon, value added products and fish-meal, -oil and -feed (FOF). Bakkafrost produced 44.013 tons of gutted salmon and 85.724 FOF in 2014. 

 Bakkafrost owns six hatcheries, 19 farming sites, five wellboats, three harvesting plants, two VAP plants and an FOF plant. The current investment plan started in 2013 and is planned to add another wellboat (delivered July 2015), another hatchery (expected to be completed in Q2 2016) and a merged harvest/VAP plant (expected to be up and running in 2016). 
Bakkafrost is fully vertically integrated. The current (2014) company structure can be seen below (Havsbrún is the FOF plant).

 [Figure 1 – Bakkafrost company structure](http://i.imgur.com/bXQhV2j.png)

 Below is a quick historical overview of Bakkafrost’s evolution from a small, family owned company to a successful, public company.  

 **1968** - Bakkafrost was founded by the two brothers Hans and Roland Jacobsen. The early Bakkafrost was mainly engaged in catching and processing of herring. 

 **1986** - Production of farmed salmon and smolts (young salmons) began. 

 **1995** - The first salmon value-added-product (VAP) factory was built and the production capacity of VAP products was increased in 1999-2001. Bakkafrost continued to grow both through M&amp;A activity in the early 2000’s. 

 **2008** - Bakkafrost started merger talks with Vestlax (another salmon producer). 

 **2010** - The merger went through making Bakkafrost the largest fish farming company in the Faroe Islands with 55% of the country’s salmon production. Bakkafrost went public in 2010. 

 **2011** - Bakkafrost acquired Havsbrún, an FOF plant. This acquisition made Bakkafrost fully vertically integrated – from the production of FOF all the way to production of VAP and sales. Being fully vertically integrated, Bakkafrost has complete oversight over all the critical production points. This helps insure a high quality product and full traceability. 

 **2013** - Bakkafrost announced an ambitious 5-year investment plan to make the onshore operation more efficient, to increase organic growth and to reduce the biological risk.

 **2014** - The best financial result ever was reached in part because of the Russian import ban on Norwegian salmon. Bakkafrost is currently being led by the son of Hans Jacobsen, Regin Jacobsen who has been the CEO for over 30 years. Bakkafrost was named OSE second best mid-cap company in 2014. 

 Note: Bakkafrost reports financial numbers in DKK (Danish Kroner) but is listed on the OSE and trades in NOK (Norwegian Kroner). Conversions between the two currencies will be made throughout the analysis at a rate of DKKNOK = 0,8225.

 **Brief industry overview**

 The salmon industry is composed of producers from many different countries spread out over the globe. The biggest producers are located in Canada, Chile, The Faroe Islands, Norway, Scotland and the United Kingdom where the biological conditions for salmons are optimal.

 [Figure 2 - Harvest volume by country](http://i.imgur.com/4PK1lYH.png)

 Back in the day salmon was mostly caught in the wild. Nowadays salmon –especially the Atlantic kind - is primarily farmed. The change has been driven by increased global demand combined with limited expansion capabilities in the wild due to fishing regulations, quotas and biological restraints. Farming salmon as opposed to catching them in the wild has the advantages that it gives greater control over the production, easier catching/ transportation and better disease control. 

 [Figure 3 - Wild vs Farmed by volume](http://i.imgur.com/C9cYo1l.png)

 Salmon is most often sold and bought in the spot market(s) or on longer term contracts with a price based on the spot price. The historical price can be seen below. Note the trending nature of the price but with large short-term volatility. 

 [Figure 4 - Salmon spot price - 25 and 50 MA](http://i.imgur.com/1n7lPBS.png)

 The spot price is driven by the balance between supply and demand (obviously) which is affected by several factors. The supply is affected by political intervention such as regulations/quotas, new investments in farms and equipment and biological/geographical factors such as diseases and weather conditions. Some of the factors driving the demand are global wealth growth, global population growth and focus sustainability (salmon farming is far more environment friendly than classic creature farming). Note that the key demand drivers are primarily megatrends.
 
 The salmon farming industry is near maximum farming/biological capacity and increasing the capacity requires large capital expenditures to new farms, processing plants, well-boats etc. As a result the global supply is expected to increase 4-5% in 2015 and 2-3% in 2016. The expectation is a yearly 3% supply increase until 2020. A balanced market with no change in spot price seems to be reached with a global supply growth of 9% per year. This strongly suggests that we will see salmon prices continue on its long-term climb in the coming years. 

 In August 2014 Russia imposed an import ban on European salmon. This created a major supply vacuum in the Russian market and enabled non-EU salmon producers to sell their fish at a premium. Bakkafrost has been a major beneficiary of this development. At the moment the ban looks to be standing as long as the situation is tense between Russia and the Western world.

 **Recent share price development**

 The chart below shows the 52-week development in Bakkafrost’s share price.

 [Figure 5 – 52 week share price](http://i.imgur.com/U7qyihS.png)

 The overall trend has been upwards mainly attributed to great financial results and the Russian situation. In the period October 2014 to April 2015 we saw some consolidation and falling share prices mainly attributable to falling/consolidating salmon spot prices. After the Q1 results reported on the 12th May we saw a strong upward movement in the price as a result of the great financial results achieved in the first quarter (it was the single best quarter in the company’s history). 

 **Management and shareholders**

 Regin Jacobsen is the CEO of Bakkafrost (1982-present day). He holds almost 4.5 million Bakkafrost shares worth over 100 million US dollars. This equals 9.2% of the total outstanding shares. His mother Oddvør Jacobsen owns 9.4% of the outstanding shares. In total the Jacobsen family owns 18.6% of the outstanding shares. The large insider ownership secures a strong alignment of shareholder’s and management’s interest. Other insiders own 0.4% of the outstanding shares. There is no option salary program in Bakkafrost and thus no (potential) dilution of the shareholder’s interest in the company except – of course – from any future equity issuance. 
 
 Regin Jacobsen has transformed the small family owned business to the Faroe Islands’ biggest and one of the world’s most successful salmon producers (looking at profit margins). He won a price for being the best CEO of a mid-cap company listed on the OSE in 2014. Salmon analysts have called the current management team the world’s best Atlantic salmon management team. 

 Reading the management’s letter to shareholders and listening to the conference calls, it is clear that the management has a long term focus. The long term focus is seen at large in Bakkafrost’s ambitious long-term investment plan.

 Having a strong management team combined with no potential dilution and a long term focus is a big bonus in my opinion. On top of these qualities it gives me faith in the company’s future prospect to know that the CEO (and family) has a lot of skin in the game. 

 After the Jacobsen family, JP Morgan is the biggest shareholder and owns 7.8% of the outstanding shares through five different subsidiaries. 

 **Products, customers and geography**

 Bakkafrost is engaged in the production and selling of fresh/frozen fish, VAP’s and FOF. 

 FOF is produced at Havsbrún. The major part of the produced feed is used in Bakkafrost’s own farming segment. Only 20 % (17537 ton out of a total production of 85724 ton - FY 2014) of the produced feed is sold externally to other fish (salmon) producers. The FOF business is generally highly volatile due to underlying volatility in the raw products (fish leftovers and/or different plant parts) going into the production of FOF. The Q1 EBITDA margin of 30,53% in the FOF segment is not sustainable and is related to very favorable raw material cost at the end of 2014. In earlier years the EBITDA margin has averaged around 10-15%. Bakkafrost uses a higher content of fish oil in its feed than the average in the fish feed industry. This makes the production of feed slightly costlier but results in salmons with higher fat (omega 3) content. Feed cost is one of the largest expenses in salmon farming and the FOF plant provides some stability regarding prices. 

 Whole gutted salmon (or head on gutted – HOG for short) is sold at spot prices to fish markets/other wholesalers. Selling salmon at a volatile spot price gives a somewhat volatile revenue and income stream. Bakkafrost has historically achieved nice margins in this segment.

 VAP’s is sold on longer term contracts to retailers and wholesalers. The prices on the contracts are based on the forward price in the salmon markets as opposed to the spot price. VAP contracts are 6-12 month in length and given the fixed price, provides a more predictable and stable income than the fresh/frozen segment. The EBIT margin achieved in the VAP segment is considerably lower and more volatile than in the fresh segment. 

 In 2014 45% of the harvested volume was used in the VAP segment while 55% was sold whole and gutted. The long term goal is to sell 40-50% of the harvested volume as VAP products. The new VAP factory will help achieve this goal as harvested volume increases in the future. 

 Bakkafrost is located favorably to export their products all over the globe. Historically, most of the Bakkafrost fish has been sold in the EU and USA. The fattier salmon taste obtained by fish feed with higher fat content is a big hit in the US. Asia has taken an increased amount of Bakkafrost fish in recent years mainly for use in sushi.  

 In 2014 a higher fraction of the fish has gone to Russia as a result of the supply vacuum following the ban on imported Norwegian salmon. Bakkafrost salmon can be sold at a premium in Russia as a result of this situation. As long as the tension between Russia and the Western world remains (and the import ban is intact), Bakkafrost is expected to sell a larger than average volume to the Russian market. 

 **Competitive edge**

 Bakkafrost operates in a commodity-like industry where true competitive advantages are somewhat rare. Bakkafrost, however, do enjoy some competitive advantages which are pushing their margins higher than industry average. One of the competitive advantages is permanent and related to the geographically location of Bakkafrost’s operations. Another one is temporary and related to the Russian situation. The last is related to the current management team and is long-term but not permanent.  

 Bakkafrost has a permanent lower feed cost because of the biological conditions in the Faroe Islands (more stable temperature throughout the year among others). As mentioned earlier the feed cost is one of the main costs in producing salmon. Having a lower feed cost provides Bakkafrost with a nice competitive advantage. This competitive advantage is well-protected through a limited number of farming licenses and Faroe regulations prohibiting foreign companies from owning more than 20% of any salmon farmer.

 Bakkafrost is not affected by the Russian import ban on European salmon. As a result Bakkafrost has acquired a sizeable chunk of the Russian salmon market and can sell its salmon at a premium compared to the spot price. This is a temporary, but possibly long standing, competitive edge. 

 On top of these two competitive edges, Bakkafrost’s management is highly skilled and focused on efficiency throughout the organization. Bruce Greenwald has stated that companies operating in commodity(-like) businesses need to have a strong focus on being the lowest-cost producer and operating as efficiently as possible. I would consider the skill of the current management team another competitive edge.

 **Risks**

 Bakkafrost is exposed to several company and industry specific risks. 

 A lower salmon price is one of the major risks faced by Bakkafrost and other salmon producers. Both top line and bottom line is heavily influenced by the salmon price. A long time with low/declining salmon prices will push the revenue and earnings down and hurt Bakkafrost.

 Since feed cost is one of the major costs associated with salmon farming, a rising feed cost will have a negative impact on Bakkafrost’s profit if it isn’t followed by a higher spot price. Feed cost is influenced by commodity prices which are highly volatile and hard to predict. This risk is somewhat mitigated by Bakkafrost’s ownership of an FOF plant. 

 Diseases caused by bacteria, viruses and parasites such as sea lice can hurt or kill the salmons and is another risk involved in salmon farming. Overall Bakkafrost has a good control with its salmon production and disease-risk has been managed tightly. Bakkafrost is actively engaged in research aimed at controlling these potential problems and is currently working on a solution to the sea lice problem by employing sea lice eating fishes (so called cleaner fish) in the salmon farms. The new well boat delivered in July is also capable of treating sea lice infected fish through a fresh water treating facility. 

 Bakkafrost is enjoying higher margins as a result of the Russian situation. If Russia removes the import ban on salmon from Norway and other EU countries the salmon supply to the Russian market will skyrocket. Bakkafrost will be hurt somewhat by this as they can no longer sell their fish at a premium. 
Overall Bakkafrost is a fairly risky business. This will be reflected in the required return used in my valuation model. 

 **Financials**

 In this section I will take a closer look at Bakkafrost’s financial statements. Some of my comments will be about my own and/or the managements expectations for the future. This will be used in the later forecast needed to make a valuation. 

 [Figure 6 - Income statement percentage change](http://i.imgur.com/jcOmxxN.png)

 [Figure 7 - Income statement common size](http://i.imgur.com/enbzumL.png)

 Looking at the income statement we see the numbers of a profitable and growing company. 

 Revenue has been growing 34,49% per year since 2010 which is attributable to a larger harvest volume (44013 ton gw in 2014 against 21626 in 2010) and a higher realized price per ton gw. We saw some slowdown in the revenue growth from 2013-2014 but I expect the growth to accelerate in the coming years as a result of the expected higher spot prices and the results of the investment plan. Especially the plan of reducing growing times of salmons from 18 months to 14-15 months gradually over the next 3 should provide a nice boost on the top-line in the coming years (guided at ~4% per year over the next three years from this development alone).

 The most notable thing in the operating expenses section is that expenses have grown considerably since 2010. This shows us that Bakkafrost is not a company that can grow without investing in more raw material purchases, higher expenses to salaries, more PP&amp;E (leading to higher depreciation charges) etc. Even though expenses have grown, they have only grown at (roughly) the same pace as revenue. This means that we have (roughly) the same operating margin today as we did in 2010. Given the high operating margin back then, I consider this a great result and it shows the management’s dedication to efficiency and meaningful growth. 

 The new harvest/VAP plant being built as part of the investment plan is expected to reduce operating expenses by 70-90 million DKK per year from 2017 and onwards. Together with the other parts of the investment plan, this makes me believe that Bakkafrost will keep on having expenses under tight control while revenue is growing nicely. 

 The fair value adjustment on biomass and (provisions for) onerous contracts are both IFRS-related non-cash adjustments made to the operational result every year. The fair value adjustment on biomass is an adjustment to reflect the current value of Bakkafrost’s biomass given changes in spot price and other changing (biological) conditions. The “onerous contracts”-item is related to the long-term VAP contracts and other contracts related to raw materials. A negative “onerous contracts”-post means that Bakkafrost is locked in contracts where the economic benefit will be lower than the cost of fulfilling the contract. In 2014 we saw a reversal of 2012 and 2013’s negative posts because conditions changed and the negative impacts were not realized as expected. As seen, both fluctuates and are very difficult to forecast with the information provided by Bakkafrost in the financial statements. 

 “Income from associates” is Bakkafrost’s share in the income of its associates P/f Pelagos (30% ownership), P/f Salmon Proteins (76% ownership), P/f Keldan (25% ownership), Hanstholm Fiskemelsfabrik (40% ownership) and P/f Faroe Farming (49% ownership). I expect these companies to attribute with a small, positive result in the future if salmon prices rise. 

 “Listing costs”, “badwill related to the acquisition of Havsbrún”, “acquisition costs” and “loss from sale of subsidiary” are non-recurring charges. The first two were one-time charges related to the listing on the OSE and the acquisition of Havsbrún. The last two are related to Bakkafrost’s acquisitions and sale of divisions/related companies. Bakkafrost has mentioned that they will make meaningful acquisitions/take stakes in other salmon-related companies if it is at good terms and in line with the overall strategy. 

 The financial income is related to the interests earned on Bakkafrost’s big cash position and any dividends received from associated companies. 

 The interest expense is related to the coupons on the bond issue, interest on the revolving credit facilities and interests on the instalment loan (all three described in greater detail under the balance sheet section). Note that the current interest expense is covered many times over by the operational earnings (and operational cash flow). 
The net currency effect is related to the currency gain on the 500 million NOK bond. 

 The currency gain comes as a result of the sharp decline in the NOKDKK pair (Bakkafrost reports numbers in DKK). A currency-swap is in place which swaps the NOK to DKK. This means that the currency gain/loss is counteracted by a loss/gain on the currency swap. This counter effect is reported under comprehensive earnings. 

 The Faroe Islands have a nominal tax rate of 18% and a special resource tax of 4,5% from 2014 and onwards. The effective tax rate was 28,03% in 2014 due to earlier deferred taxes. I expect the effective tax rate to remain above the nominal tax rate for some time due a big deferred tax liability on the balance sheet. I expect the effective tax rate to be 22,5% in the longer run. 

 There are no non-controlling interests taking part in the profits of Bakkafrost. Furthermore there is no potential dilution from options as they are not part of the employer/executive salary package. The only potential dilution is from potential future increase of equity. Later in the cash flow section I will explain why I don’t see new equity being issued in the near future. 

 When looking at the income statement it is worth noting that in 2014 the margins were higher than the 2010-2013 average margins. As stated earlier this is attributable to the Russian situation. But it is also worth noting that the 2010-2013 margins were high even without having the effect of the Russian import ban. This shows us that Bakkafrost enjoys the gains from the Russian situation but is in no way dependent on it to survive or produce above average margins. 

 Condensing the income statement into one word I would call it “great”. 

 [Figure 8 - Balance sheet percentage change](http://i.imgur.com/mEtoqwx.png)

 [Figure 9 - Balance sheet common size](http://i.imgur.com/GGk1E1v.png)

 Looking at the balance sheet we see the numbers of a financially solid company.
 
 The “Intangible assets”-item is the first and in my opinion the most interesting item in the balance sheet. Bakkafrost writes that: “Intangible assets comprise primarily the fair value of acquired farming licenses. No licenses in the North region are recorded with a value in the Bakkafrost accounts.” This could mean that we’re looking at a sizeable hidden asset since a license to farm salmon in a given area is by no means worthless.

 First of all we have to split up the farming sites (and their farming license) into a Farming West and a Farming North region. Bakkafrost does not disclose which farming sites belong to Farming West and which ones belong to Farming North. After many hours of searching I found a semi-outdated site which lists all the Faroe fishing licenses and the owners. On figure 10 we see all Bakkafrost’s farming sites marked with circles. The yellow ones are listed on the site as belonging to “Bakkafrost Farming North” while the green ones are listed as belonging to “Bakkafrost Farming West”. The farming sites represented by red circles are listed as either belonging to just “Bakkafrost Farming” or another company from which Bakkafrost has later acquired the license. The blue line on figure 10 is my best guess at a division between the two regions. 

 [Figure 10 - Bakkafrost farming locations](http://i.imgur.com/WRwYcfR.png)

 This means that we have between eight and ten farming licenses which are recorded at a value of 0. To put a value on this hidden asset I’ll take a look at the value of the fishing licenses which are already on the balance sheet. 

 The intangible asset (worth 294,7 million DKK) is composed of at least six and up to nine farming licenses. To be conservative I’ll assume that this number is for all nine licenses potentially belonging to Bakkafrost Farming West. This means that each license is worth 294,7 million DKK / 9 = 32,7 million DKK per license. Therefore the eight to ten licenses located in the North region is worth between 261,6 and 327 million DKK. The market values Bakkafrost’s assets at 2,9 times assets. Using this as a guide, the hidden assets could be equal to 758,64-948,3 million DKK of additional market value. This is roughly 7%-9% of Bakkafrost’s current market cap. 
Given the uncertainty of the calculations made above I will not include the value of the hidden asset in my total business valuation. It is an area worthy of further research though and later on I will contact the management/IR department and ask them about it. 

 The total PP&amp;E consists of all non-financial “hard assets” in Bakkafrost. This includes the hatcheries (six), farming sites (19), wellboats (five), harvesting plants (three), offices (various sales offices and the headquarter), processing plants (two), packaging plant (one), FOF plant (one), prepayments made for several hard assets in the investment plant and various other small PP&amp;E assets such as computers, furniture etc. 

 Under the “Total non-current financial items” we have the “Investments in associated companies” and “Investments in stocks and shares” which consists of the stakes in the associated companies mentioned earlier. The long-term receivable is a minor item related to a long standing receivable with a customer. It is expected to be realized at the value stated on the balance sheet. 

 The total inventory consists of the biomass (equal to ~30% of the total assets) and other inventory. The biomass is valued at fair value and subject to an adjustment every year. The other inventory consists primarily of raw materials going into the FOF plant, packing material and semi-finished goods.

 The “total receivables”-item consists of accounts receivables and other receivables. Accounts receivables have grown far less than the total amount of assets which shows a tighter control with the account receivables. The other receivables are related to VAT, deposits for derivatives and receivables from the associated companies. 

 The cash and cash equivalent item is the bank deposits and other near-cash instruments such as short term bonds. Even with a high dividend and ambitious investment Bakkafrost has been able to build a big cash position (11,7% of total assets). I suspect that the cash position hasn’t been distributed as a dividend/buyback due to upcoming debt liabilities, future payments for the investment plan and to “buff up” the balance sheet in order to be able to withstand potential adverse industry/company specific developments. 

 Overall the total amount of assets has grown rapidly since 2010. The growth in total assets has been faster than the growth in equity because the total liabilities have been growing faster than the total assets. 

 The equity has been growing fast with no increase in the share capital. This is the result of high and fast growing comprehensive income. The equity/liabilities-ratio has been shrinking since 2010 due to new debt financing. The equity share is ~60% which I consider enough given the high amount of liquid assets, interest coverage ratio and quick ratio. 

 Long-term interest bearing liabilities (short- and long-term) consists of three different debt instruments which accounts for ~17,5% of the total equity and liabilities and 43,2% of the total liabilities. The first debt instrument is a 500 million NOK unsecured bond issued in 2013 with a five year tenor. The interest is NIBOR 3m + 4,15%. The currency has been swapped to DKK and the interest rate to CIBOR 3m due to primary exposure to DKK and EUR. The second debt instrument is an instalment loan of 500 million DKK obtained in 2011. It is payable with 25 million DKK each quarter (100 million DKK is listed as “short-term interested bearing debts”). The last debt instrument is a 600 million DKK (adjusted down to 553 million DKK after a sale of a subsidiary) overdraft facility fully payable in 2016.  

 As written earlier I suspect that the interest bearing debt is part of the reason why Bakkafrost has been building a big cash position. They have to pay back 653 million DKK in 2016, 100 million DKK (remainder of the instalment loan) in 2017 and 500 million NOK in 2018. Bakkafrost currently has 753 million DKK in available bank financing. 

 Bakkafrost has a sizeable deferred tax liability that – as noted under the income statement section – will keep the effective tax rate higher than the nominal tax rate for some time into the future. 

 The “derivatives”-item is an item related to different derivatives used in Bakkafrost. The two derivatives mentioned in the annual report are the currency-swap and the interest rate-swap related to the bond.

 In 2013 Bakkafrost decided to break the current liabilities into more sub-categories. “Trade payables” and “other current liabilities” took the place of “accounts payable and other debt” in 2013. These are small items related to bills waiting to be paid and other small, current liabilities not specified by Bakkafrost.

 In total, the amount of liabilities has been rising fast. It is however not alarming in my eyes since Bakkafrost generates huge amounts of cash through operations and have a lot of cash on hand to pay upcoming debts (see next section). 

 Overall the balance sheet and capital structure look solid to me. I do however want to keep a close eye on the development in the balance sheet when the big debt payments arrive because they arrive at a time where cash is needed for the investment plan. It should be no problem due to a high free cash flow (see next section) but it is always worth being on top of these sorts of things. 

 [Figure 11 - Cash flow statement](http://i.imgur.com/iy2Ttj4.png)

 Looking at the cash flow statement we see a flourishing company creating a solid stream of free cash flow.

 The cash flow from operations takes the operational EBIT and adds back all the non-cash charges made on the income statement such as the fair value adjustments to the biomass and depreciation charges. It has been growing very fast in the last years primarily attributable to the fast increase in operational EBIT.

 In the investment section we see the cash used in various investments. The most notable part is the massive use of money to buy or prepay PP&amp;E. This is the result of the investment plan. Worth noting is that Bakkafrost still has a lot of money left after paying for the various investments. In other words, Bakkafrost has a high amount of free cash flow which is great. The high free cash flow points in the direction of no additional equity issuance in the near future and a high sustainability of the current dividend. 

 Looking at the financing section we see that Bakkafrost has acquired extra funding through the various debt instruments mentioned in the balance sheet section. One of the main cash drainers is the high (and historically fast growing) dividend being paid. The upcoming payment of 653 million DKK will be another major cash drainer next year but Bakkafrost should have no trouble with the payment given the high free cash flow and big cash position. When some of the current interest bearing debt has been payed of I could see Bakkafrost raise the dividend aggressively or initiate a buyback program due to the high free cash flow. 

 Overall the cash flow statement supports my conclusion regarding the income statement and balance sheet. The story being told by the financial statements is that we are looking at a great company. During my analysis I discovered no suspicious accounting. From the revenue recognition practices to the assumptions used to fair value the biomass and intangible assets, everything looks okay in my eyes.

 **Dividend policy**

 The dividend is currently at 6 DKK (payout ratio of 45%). The dividend policy is to payout 30-50% of the net income. Management has said that the investment plan will not change the dividend policy. 

 As written in the last section, Bakkafrost has a high free cash flow and therefore I consider the current dividend sustainable. 

 The current dividend gives a yield of 3%. Be advised that you MIGHT experience some dividend related tax troubles depending on your location. Personally, I have to send a letter to the Faroe tax authority every year to get a tax refund on the dividend. 

 [Figure 12 - EPS DPS and Payout ratio](http://i.imgur.com/qQcxtUG.png)

 **Competitors**

 The list of competitors is composed of the other seafood companies listed on the OSE. 

 **Austevoll Seafood** is the fourth largest company in the group with a market cap of 8,5 billion NOK. Austevoll is a diversified pelagic fishery based in Norway but with operations in Chile, Norway and Peru. 

 **Grieg Seafood** is the second smallest company in the group with a market cap of 2,9 billion NOK. Grieg Seafood is a salmon and trout producer based in Norway but with operations in Canada, Norway and the United Kingdom. 

  **Lerøy Seafood Group** is the second largest company in the group with a market cap of 15,3 billion NOK. Lerøy Seafood Group is engaged in salmon farming and diversified seafood. 

  **Marine Harvest** is the largest company in the group with a market cap of 45,4 billion NOK. Marine Harvest offers a wide range of seafood. It is based in Norway but has operations in most of the major seafood countries. 

  **Norway Royal Salmon** is the third smallest company in the group with a market cap of 3,1 billion NOK. Norway Royal Salmon is a salmon and trout producer based in Norway. 

  **SalMar** is the third largest company in the group with a market cap of 14,6 billion NOK. SalMar is a salmon producer based in Norway. 

 **The Scottish Salmon Company** is the smallest company in the group with a market cap of 0,98 billion NOK. The Scottish Salmon company is a salmon producer based in Scotland. 


 To give you an idea about the relative ranking between these companies and Bakkafrost, I have chosen to compare them with the use of nine business metrics. Revenue and EBIT growth tells us something about how much the companies have grown in the recent past. EBIT margin and EBIT per kg gutted weight tells us something about how good the companies are at turning one dollar of revenue/one kg gutted fish into operating profit. ROIC and ROCE tells us something about how good the companies are at using their invested/employed capital optimal. Interest coverage and quick ratio tells us something about the companies’ financial strength. Lastly we have a dividend yield which is our direct yield of holding the investment. 

 [Figure 13 - Comparison on business metrics](http://i.imgur.com/OEprSLm.png)

 The top two in each metric is colored green and the bottom two is colored red. Looking at these business ratios, Bakkafrost is by far the best company of the group. It ranks as the best or second best in almost every ratio. In the two ratios where it doesn’t, it still has a solid position. A quick ratio of right around 2 (especially combined with the magnificent interest coverage) and a sustainable dividend yield just shy of 3% is not bad at all. 

 **Valuation**

 [Figure 14 – Relative valuation](http://i.imgur.com/g9tiOtg.png)

 Given that Bakkafrost is the best company in the comparison group (as measured by the nine business metrics) one might expect that Bakkafrost is valued relatively high compared to the others. But this is actually not the case. Looking at figure 14 we see that Bakkafrost is valued approximately in the middle of the group. It is neither cheap nor expensive measured on a relative basis. My earlier analysis points in the direction of a good future for Bakkafrost and the reasonable relative valuation could mean that we’re looking at a bargain.  

 To determine whether Bakkafrost is a bargain at the current price, I will use a Discounted Abnormal Operating Model (DAOE). This type of model is described in greater detail in “Financial Statements Analysis and Security Valuation” by Stephen Penman. It is somewhat expensive but I highly recommended it. 

 I will do a base case, optimist case (moderately optimistic, not “blue sky”) and pessimist case (moderately pessimistic, not “draconian”) valuation. The valuation will be based on a five year proforma statement for each case. The “cost of operations”/WACC is based on a “bottom up”-beta (Damodaran’s concept) with added industry specific risk. 

 The base case is built around average result from the investment plan and a moderate increase in salmon spot prices and harvest volumes

 [Figure 15 – Base case DAOE](http://i.imgur.com/D4icNia.png)

 In the base case we get a fair value of 316,25 NOK per share. I consider the base case the most probable and assign it a probability of 60%. 

 The pessimist case is built on expectations of poor results from the investment plan, a moderate decrease in salmon spot prices and a constant harvest volume

 [Figure 16 – Pessimist case DAOE](http://i.imgur.com/UW8ZxDa.png)

 In the pessimist case we get a fair value of 183,11 NOK per share. I consider the pessimist/optimist case the least probable and assign them both a probability of 20%.
The optimist case is built on high expectations for the investment plant and a solid increase in salmon spot prices and harvest volume

 [Figure 17 – Optimist case DAOE](http://i.imgur.com/wCteyLe.png)

 In the base case we get a fair value of 395,72 NOK per share.

 Condensing the three cases into a single valuation I come up with a value of 305,5 NOK (0,60 * 316,25 NOK + 0,2 * 183,11 NOK + 0,2 * 395,72 NOK) per share. This value is 20,3% percent higher than the current price of 254 NOK. 

 **Catalysts**

 There are several different potential catalysts in the near future that can push Bakkafrost to my estimated fair value of 305,5 NOK.

 As written in the industry overview, salmon prices are expected to rise in the coming years as supply growth slows down. This is currently the biggest catalyst for Bakkafrost and I expect a strong rally as a result of great financial results if the higher spot price materializes as expected.  

 Chile is the second largest producer of salmon after Norway. The Chilean farming capacity has grown at an explosive rate in the last decade and quality/disease control has not been able to keep up with the growth. Therefore, news about adverse developments in the Chilean salmon/fishing industry such as disease outbreaks comes out every now and then. This kind of news pushes up the price of non-Chilean salmon farmers. Production problems in Chile act as a potential catalyst on non-Chilean farmers especially farmers (such as Bakkafrost) who can sell their fish to the Russian market with even less competition.

 The Russian situation is a joker in the Bakkafrost case. A step up (or prolongation) of the Russian conflict could act as a catalyst and push the stock price up but it could also hurt the investor sentiment and make investors more risk averse. 

 **Conclusion**

 Bakkafrost is a great company operating in an interesting industry which stands to benefit from limited supply growth in the short/mid-term and several megatrends in the long run. The management in place is as good as it gets and has been called the best salmon farming management team by analysts. 

 The gap up to my valuation of 305,5 NOK can be closed by several near-term catalysts. Bakkafrost is currently valued at a discount of 20,3% based on my valuation. Bakkafrost is not a deep value stock but rather a “good company at a fair price” kind of value opportunity. It is to some degree a play on the tension between Russia and the western world.

 My recommendation: **Buy**

AVXL is heavily shorted right now (&gt;45% by volume last few days), buy in is a steal at 1.30.  There should absolutely be a run-up to ER on Aug 17 just for the chance of ""news"" in the guidance.

If guidance shows good cash reserves we should be good since the company won't need to dilute.  Prior DD suggests this will be the case.   If any of the following is hinted at or mentioned in the ER there can be a great surge...

a) Any new mentions on how p2a is progressing.
b) Talks to license anavex for its other indications in epilepsy, parkinson's or ALS.
c) Plans to start their own p2 trials for any of the above indictions.

Like AQXP, AVXL has a tiny float so spikes will be amplified.

This is a penny stock, do your own DD and be VERY comfortable with the possibility of losing money on your position.",29

15-08-10,3gey78,"My analysis of Apple's potential to add $15 billion a year to its bottom line and transform the toilet paper industry","I know it sounds crazy but hear me out. This is one of the few industry's ripe for a transformation.

Apple is one of the most vertically integrated companies and in the toilet paper industry, vertical integration makes you or break you. 

So imagine the savings possible by using their expertise in vertical integration to buy forests, lumber yards and toilet paper manufactures. They could transform the toilet paper industry in ways never done before.

**My analysis:**


* 300 million Americans
* say on average people go three times a day, use 12 squares when they go, each square is 3 inches long and each role is 30 feet long. 
* that means they're going through a role about every 3 days or 9 rolls a month
* that also means each month, American use 2.7 billion rolls 
* Assume our goal is 80% market saturation(Apple always dreamsbig), we need 2.1 billions rolls a month. 
* With each tree giving on average 4 rolls a month, we need 2.1 billion / 4 = 525,000,000 trees

Suppose it costs $5 a month for 20 years to care for a tree on average and $10 on average to cut it down. 

So a tree costs Apple $1210 over its 20-year life. 

**We want to figure out if the toilet paper we get from this one tree will make up for its cost:** 

* Assume the tree is an average 1 foot diameter and average 75 feet tall. Ignore the branches. Thus we get (3.14 * 0.5^2) * 75 = 58.87 cubic feet of wood. 
* I do not know how much toilet paper you can get out of a cubic foot of wood. I imagine a lot. Lets say 16 rolls. That means the tree as a whole will give us 58.87 * 16 = 942 rolls of toilet paper. 
* If we sell a pack of 4 rolls for 8 dollars, then this tree will generate (942/4) * 8 = $1884 in revenue per tree over its life
* Thus on average, **each tree will generate $1884 - $1210 = $674 in profit over its life, or about 12 rolls a quarter.**


**Start-up Costs to acquire 525,000,000 trees:**

* There are 4840 square yards in one acre. Assume a tree every square yard.
* So we need 108,470 acres of trees. This sound like a lot but its only 169 square miles. Or a sqaure with sides 13-miles long. It would be super easy to find this land in Alaksa or canada. 
* Say an 1 acre of woods near Portland, Oregon costs $50,000.
* So start-up cost of buying the land at $50,000 an acre would be $5.4 billion. With close to $200 billion in cash reserves, Apple wouldn't even notice it was gone. 
* assuming apple buys all of J&amp;J toilet paper plants for $500 million, so to have resources nessesary to reach 80% market saturation, the total start-up cost would be **$5.9 billion**


**Operating Costs:**

* assume one worker can takes care of 50 acres and each worker earns $20 an hour, and works 20 hours a week
* also assume there are misc costs per acre per quarter of $1000
* that means growing the trees costs Apple ($20 * $20 * 12)/50 + (3 * $1000) = $3096 per acre per quarter
* toilet paper plants - assume they cost an average $50 million a month to operate
* assume misc costs(marketing, salary, rent, utlities, ect) of $200 million a year
* thus there are operating costs of ($50M * 12) + $200M + ($3096 * 4 * 108,470) = **$2.1 billion a year**

**How much revenue can we make?**

* If each tree generates $674 in revenue over its life, that is $33.7 in revenue a year
* if we have 525,000,000 trees, then that is $17.6 billion - $2.1 billion = **$15.5 billion in profit per year!**

###Quick facts:

AXPW signed a LOI with LCB on June 13th stating that they would execute a final agreement within 60 days to sell and distribute AXPW's batteries in China. 

Within 10 business days of the execution of the LOI, LCB will pay AXPW $0.25M non-refundable deposit.

AXPW will be paid $2M in tech fee in 4 instalments with the first $0.5M to be paid 45 days after LOI and $500K every six months after the LOI execution.

AXPW will be paid 2% royalties of gross revenue with a minimum annual royalty of $1M by year 3 and 110% per year thereafter capped at $2M per year

LCB will buy $4M of preferred stock within 45 days of execution. $2M at $2 par, convertibility pending approval. (?) 4% dividends. Convertible to common shares at 120% 20 day VWAP (*guesstimated at* $2.26 (120% included)) prior to execution.

Warrants to LCB still confuse me. Looks like $2M at $0.1 per share (pre-split?) with an  17 month term and warrant of $8M for $0.5 per share (pre-split?) with a four year term. 

LCB will buy a (different?) $4M convertible loan within 3 months of execution at 5% interest with conversion set at 130% 20 day VWAP prior to execution of LOI. 

LCB will set up a joint venture within 6 months owned 90/10 by LCB/AXPW (AXPW has the option to increase up to 25%) and LCB will fund the joint venture with $20M cash.

---

On the 6th of Aug, they entered an agreement to sell $0.6M 90 day notes at 12% interest per annum. This is also a bit confusing to me due to the verbiage but I'm working through it.

The key thing is that they claimed: ""The above described transaction is intended as a bridge to the transactions with LCB International, Inc. contemplated by the June 2015 Binding Letter of Intent between the Company and LCB,"" which indicates to me that a deal is going through.

---

I'm still learning so a lot of the filings are hard for me to digest. To me the deal appears to be a sure thing, but if it was, I'm sure the share price wouldn't be so low. At the time of writing, AXPW's market cap is $4.08M. 

Please don't take my words and thoughts as fact, I could be misinterpreting the filings, and I'm obviously biased given my position.

15-08-10,3gg3ax,[Discussion] Mutual funds / ETFS and their influence on markets,"I have two questions aimed at better understanding how mutual funds / ETFs that track indices influence the market. These questions particularly pertain to situations in which these products make up a large portion of the market. This may happen or have already happened, since they are increasing in popularity.


**Market correlation**

Assuming that trackers own a large portion of shares in an index, how do these products influence the correlation between the shares of the underlying companies? My intuition is that the larger the portion the trackers own, the more substantial correlation becomes.

And if true, how do you view this effect? Do you consider this a long-term risk, or, do you believe this is not an issue?


**Price vs value**

Another concern is that a substantial portion of investors in index trackers may not care about actual value of the underlying assets. For example, people may buy trackers with the goal to achieve diversification and thus reduce risk, or because of market efficiency (i.e. the idea that one cannot beat the market, so should just follow the average). Both are valid reasons, but don't consider the actual underlying assets.

In short, I wonder if enough people place money in index trackers (without caring of the value of the underlying assets), the price of its assets will increase drastically, while the underlying value may not. 

E.g. there's an index that starts tracking one asset A. Asset A is a company that never grows, it doesn't buy machines and doesn't sell more products over time. Its initially value is 100, and its price is initially also 100. People start buying the index for reasons that don't consider the actual company, which raises the stock price 10% every year. But the value of this company doesn't grow - its stock is just becoming expensive.

Is this a legitimate concern? Can our behavior lead to broad markets becoming overpriced?

This one caught my eye because, well, it is selling for way less than its net working capital minus all liabilities.  

Net Current Assets is 291 Million and Total liabilities (that's right total) is only 67 million.  This means its current value (not even including any factories or other illiquid assets) is 224 million, but its market cap is only a measly 68 million.

So, it is trading at 30% of its net working capital value alone, and 22% of its net tangible assets.

It has not had a period of negative earnings as far as my chart goes (albeit not far), but has seen income decrease from 44 million in 2013 to 25 million in 2014.  Regardless, its current p/e is 2.38, and it pays a $.40 dividend (yield about 19%).

Stock promoter Michael Forster of San Luis Obispo, California, is alleged by the SEC to have engaged in numerous illegal pump-and-dump schemes while paying a broker to trade in the stocks he was promoting. The commission filed a lawsuit on Thursday asking that a subpoena be enforced against Forster, who has been resisting complying with the order for some time now.

Forster’s attorney has said that his client would be incriminating himself if he did comply, saying that Mr. Forster is the target of a related federal criminal probe. The parties will stand before a federal judge on 1 September in order to see if the subpoena will be enforced.

According to court papers filed by the SEC, the commission believes that Forster owns and operates numerous promotional websites operating through several corporate entities. The SEC maintains that he has been promoting the stock of various microcap companies in numerous pump-and-dump campaigns without accurately disclosing that those companies paid him to promote the stocks.

The SEC said it also is investigating whether Forster has been paying undisclosed compensation to broker-dealers to trade the stocks he is promoting. Those entities include Monarch Bay Securities LLC, an El Segundo, California-based broker dealer founded in 2006.

The SEC said it launched a formal investigation in January of this year and subpoenaed Forster in February, seeking documents related to his communications with David Kavrell, a managing director at Monarch.

The federal regulator said it believes Forster maintains a brokerage account at Monarch in the name of his girlfriend and that he and Kavrell frequently communicated about trading penny stocks.

The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Forster, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-mc-246.",0

(www.surna.com)


I like SRNA through the end of this week.  Depending on the earnings report I may play it again next week.  I am looking for an additional bounce up of ~50% from my play in this stock last week (35%).

The stock has a tight float and the technical indicators for the short term are bullish.  [Please see here](http://www.stockta.com/cgi-bin/analysis.pl?symb=SRNA&amp;cobrand=&amp;mode=stock)

Surna Inc. designs, manufactures, and distributes systems for controlled environment agriculture (CEA). It offers indoor climate control systems, including chillers, lights, reflectors, and irrigation systems, for use in conjunction with cannabis and CEA industry. The company serves cannabis cultivation facilities; and other indoor agricultural producers, including organic herb and vegetable producers. Surna Inc. was incorporated in 2009 and is headquartered in Boulder, Colorado. 

I am beginning to go back into select cannabis stocks.  $SRNA looks to be one of the best of the bunch.  It is still a ""top line"" (pre-earnings) company, but there is an incredible upside to this ticker.

I am on the fence about the long term viability of this stock due to some issues in ownership and dilution restriction.  First and foremost the CEO has enough ownership to cause some damage to PPS and there have been no real filings on the restrictions of his stock that I have seen.

Please understand the volatility before betting...


**How I play micocaps &amp; pennies**

1) Evaluate the technicals - this is called charting or T/A. You are looking for short term indicators if you are swing or day trading. If you are new to this your should read up on investopedia or a similar site. 

2) Evaluate the fundamentals - website, staff &amp; board, A/S and O/S, recent PRs, 8k &amp; 10k, market strength

3) Evaluate the Hype - is average volume increasing, are more PRs coming out than normal, IHub chatter, tweets, and facebook

4) Take your knowledge and decide whether you will invest. I usually weight a stock 50% tech, 30% fund, 20% hype - though this is case by case.

5) Set an exit goal and a pain floor. Set a timeframe.

6) Do not get attached to your stock in a positive or negative way.

7) Take your profits and get out or cauterize the wound and get out.

8) Rinse, repeat, and rock on.

**TLDR:**
DD should be done throughout your play. Not just at the beginning.

1) Technicals &gt; Fundamentals &gt; Hype

2) Never get emotional

3)**Greedy Pigs Get Slaughtered**

I'm nervous about this for two reasons:

* Reduced supply almost always means increased prices.  Instead of having to find a way to use it domestically, American oil will get sold to the highest bidder overseas, raising prices at home.
* Boehner and the GOP support the move (better link [here](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/29/us-usa-crudeexports-idUSKCN0Q32SQ20150729) ), and although he says it will lower prices, I suspect the primary beneficiary of such an action probably isn't Mr &amp; Mrs America.  More likely such a move means increased profits for oil companies, and darn few others.

BUT, I will admit to not fully understanding the difference between the various types of oil that we can and cannot (??) refine domestically, so maybe this isn't a big deal after all.

Thoughts?

The trust is a conduit trust and we are currently permitted to take out RMDs (from the IRA within the trust to cash within the trust) based on my age over my lifetime.

However, in a year the trust automatically terminates and is dissolved, splitting equally between me and my brother, splitting the IRA to each of us as individuals.

MY QUESTION: Can this inherited IRA, now split, having already been passed to a spouse, turned into an inherited IRA, passed to a trust and then passed onto me individually, be reformed as an inherited IRA that would allow me to withdraw it at a minimum RMD spaced out over my remaining expected lifespan, or would I be required to draw down the IRA within five years (or take a lump sum immediately).

**How I play micocaps &amp; pennies**

1) Evaluate the technicals - this is called charting or T/A. You are looking for short term indicators if you are swing or day trading. If you are new to this your should read up on investopedia or a similar site. 

2) Evaluate the fundamentals - website, staff &amp; board, A/S and O/S, recent PRs, 8k &amp; 10k, market strength

3) Evaluate the Hype - is average volume increasing, are more PRs coming out than normal, IHub chatter, tweets, and facebook

4) Take your knowledge and decide whether you will invest. I usually weight a stock 50% tech, 30% fund, 20% hype - though this is case by case.

5) Set an exit goal and a pain floor. Set a timeframe.

6) Do not get attached to your stock in a positive or negative way.

7) Take your profits and get out or cauterize the wound and get out.

8) Rinse, repeat, and rock on.

**TLDR:**
DD should be done throughout your play. Not just at the beginning.

1) Technicals &gt; Fundamentals &gt; Hype

2) Never get emotional

3)**Greedy Pigs Get Slaughtered**

15-08-11,3gjyln,AVXL update.,"So monday we had a stellar PR that, if nothing else, re-enforced the validity of the company (important for a penny biotech), short volume fell 5% to 40% of volume, we had HUGE volume, and the stock still fell .10c at end of day. After a lot of research, I believe that warrants have been converted and at least some of the shares are now diluting the stock.

While I remain confident of the milestone prices (9/9, 10/5 conferences), I am no longer confident on the immediate price of the stock up to ER on 8/17. I think in September, anyone who got in at 1.40-1.60 will still be happy with their returns.

Anyway, he gave me an hour long promotional DVD which I'm watching right now. The biggest point the DVD is making is that individual investors have an advantage over big investors and funds because they are smaller and more agile.

Basically a big investor has to buy stocks slowly over weeks or else they'll quickly jack the price way up.  Therefore with their system you identify where the big guys are buying and ride that stock up for a couple weeks then get out when they're done buying.

Problems I'm seeing with this:

* Identifying these stocks as well as the specific timing is non-trivial to say the least
* There is absolutely no reason to believe that big investors don't use their own proprietary system to buy stocks, therefore it's incredibly naive to think that a stock can't drop below your purchase price just because a big investor is in ""buy mode"" for that stock.
* The whole point of the big investors buying slow is to not raise the price so how much gain can I really expect to see?
* If this overall concept worked then there would already be automated systems exploiting it much more quickly and efficiently than a home investor could ever hope to.

15-08-10,3gi3eg,An important message for people in $GTATQ!,"Hi,

Having spoken to multiple people who have personally interacted with the presiding Judge Henry J. Boroff during these proceedings, believe that the Honorable Judge is interested in preserving shareholders value so long as there is righteous, legal, and clear cause to do so.

There is a pending hearing on the 27th of August 2015 for what will likely be the final opportunity for Shareholders (termed in federal bankruptcy cases as ""Equity Security Holders"") to achieve representation during this case!

From my experience face-to-face with the parties to this case (GTAT -- termed, ""the Debtors"", The Bondholders (termed, ""the creditors""), and the presiding judge, it is certain that letters to the court in support of the Equity Security Holder's petition for the appointment of a Committee of Equity Security Holders  will create a bigger opportunity for such a committee to be formed!

You as a shareholder of GT Advanced Technologies, et al. will then have paid legal representation during these hearings.

We all know that Tom Guttierrez shockingly and suddenly retired today because he doesn't want to be called to the stand to testify if an Equity Holders committee is created.

But that does not protect us equity security holders from getting slaughtered if we fail to support the legal professionals, investment analysis profesionals, and volunteer team of equity holders who are working to get us paid representation.

Therefore, it is in your best interest to download this Wordpad document and print it. Read the document and put your name on it. Then Date and Sign the document. Write the address of the document onto a normal letter-sized envelope with a U.S. Postal Service stamp. Finally, place the document into the envelope and mail it.

Do this today or your letter will not arrive in time to be considered during the August 27th hearing.

15-08-11,3gkego,CapitalOneInvesting (Sharebuilder) Ceasing Costco Partnership Discount (see text) - Any Suggestions for Broker Alternative?,"The email I got yesterday:

&gt; News about your Capital One InvestingSM account and Costco discount pricing	

&gt; Dear trustmeep, 

&gt; Capital One Investing and Costco are retiring our relationship on September 1, 2015, and we want to let you know how this could impact you. 

&gt; For your existing accounts, you'll still receive your Costco benefits, including the $5.95 trade price (low-priced securities, options and mutual funds may be extra). However, standard pricing and rates for trades will apply to any new investing accounts you open. See standard pricing and rates, and see Costco pricing and rates. 

&gt; You can still expect the same great service and access to the same user-friendly investing tools you already have. Of course, if you've bookmarked capitaloneinvesting.com/Costco, go ahead and update it to capitaloneinvesting.com. 

As an aside, they're acting like you get to keep your discounts, but they've actually raised the price by at least a dollar on the original Costco discounts everywhere but the automatic investment plan.  Non-discount prices are increasing anywhere from 10-35%.  This isn't really a low-cost broker anymore...I mean, it's not eTrade or whatever, but still...

For reference, here's the updated [Costco Pricing](https://www.capitaloneinvesting.com/costco/pricing-trading.aspx), and the [CapitalOneInvesting Pricing](https://www.capitaloneinvesting.com/main/pricing-trading.aspx).

----------------------

I'm considering jumping ship, so if anyone has any suggestions for a low-cost broker I'd love to hear them.  I think this might be useful for some other folks too, as I know of at least ten other Redditors on the same discount.

If there's some type of referral program, I'd be willing to consider sending a bonus someone's way.

I'd be looking to continue to invest approximately $1000 a month in at least three to six stocks / index funds and transfer my existing holdings to the broker ($50k+).

To give some framework, I've spent approximately $750 in trading fees (including my Sharebuilder automatic investment subscription) over the past 4 years and 4 months. 

Basic requirements:

* Low trade fees or some type of low-cost trade plan, better than $5.95 a trade.  My round-trip buy/sell was about $8, though I do very little selling.

* Automatic reinvestment of dividends with no fees.

* Decent tax reporting from the broker (so I don't have to anything but had the printouts to my accountant).

* Decent research tools.  Sharebuilder wasn't amazing, but charts, history, and industry ratings are nice-to-haves.

* Ease of depositing and solid online presence (website / mobile / API) are pluses.

* Options trading, to include shorting (sell to open), would be nice, as Sharebuilder doesn't offer that.

* Transfer or new account bonuses are, of course, a plus.

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges against 32 defendants for taking part in a scheme to profit from stolen nonpublic information about corporate earnings announcements. Those charged include two Ukrainian men who allegedly hacked into newswire services to obtain the information and 30 other defendants in and outside the U.S. who allegedly traded on it, generating more than $100 million in illegal profits.
 
The SEC’s complaint unsealed today was filed under seal on August 10 in U.S. District Court in Newark, N.J., and the court entered an asset freeze and other preliminary relief that day.

“This international scheme is unprecedented in terms of the scope of the hacking, the number of traders, the number of securities traded and profits generated,” said Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White. “These hackers and traders are charged with reaping more than $100 million in illicit profits by stealing nonpublic information and trading based on that information. That deception ends today as we have exposed their fraudulent scheme and frozen their assets.”

The SEC charges that over a five-year period, Ivan Turchynov and Oleksandr Leremenko spearheaded the scheme, using advanced techniques to hack into two or more newswire services and steal hundreds of corporate earnings announcements before the newswires released them publicly. The SEC further charges that Turchynov and Leremenko created a secret web-based location to transmit the stolen data to traders in Russia, the Ukraine, Malta, Cyprus, France, and three U.S. states, Georgia, New York, and Pennsylvania. The traders are alleged to have used this nonpublic information in a short window of opportunity to place illicit trades in stocks, options, and other securities, sometimes purportedly funneling a portion of their illegal profits to the hackers.

“This cyber hacking scheme is one of the most intricate and sophisticated trading rings that we have ever seen, spanning the globe and involving dozens of individuals and entities,” said Andrew Ceresney, Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “Our use of innovative analytical tools to find suspicious trading patterns and expose misconduct demonstrates that no trading scheme is beyond our ability to unwind.”

In parallel actions, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against several of the defendants in the SEC’s action, including Turchynov and Leremenko, and traders in the U.S. and Ukraine – Arkadiy Dubovoy, Igor Dubovoy, Pavel Dubovoy, Vitaly Korchevsky, Vladislav Khalupsky, Aleksandr Garkusha, and Leonid Momotok. 

According to the SEC’s complaint, Turchynov and Leremenko hid the intrusions by using proxy servers to mask their identities and by posing as newswire service employees and customers. The two allegedly recruited traders with a video showcasing their ability to steal the earnings information before its public release. The complaint charges that in return for the information, the traders sometimes paid the hackers a share of their profits, even going so far as to give the hackers access to their brokerage accounts to monitor the trading and ensure that they received the appropriate percentage of the profits. The complaint charges that the traders sought to conceal their illicit activity by establishing multiple accounts in a variety of names, funneling money to the hackers as supposed payments for construction and building equipment, and trading in products such as contracts for difference (CFDs).  

At times, the hackers and traders had a very narrow window of opportunity to extract and use the allegedly hacked information. In one particularly dramatic instance on May 1, 2013, the hackers and traders allegedly moved in the 36-minute period between a newswire’s receipt and release of an announcement that a company was revising its earnings and revenue projections downward. According to the SEC’s complaint, 10 minutes after the company sent the still-confidential release to the newswire, traders began selling short its stock and selling CFDs, realizing $511,000 in profits when the company’s stock price fell following the announcement.  

The SEC’s complaint charges each of the 32 defendants with violating federal antifraud laws and related SEC antifraud rules and seeks a final judgment ordering the defendants to pay penalties, return their allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and be subject to permanent injunctions from future violations of the antifraud laws.",2
15-08-10,3git17,"The Long &amp; Short of It - Trading Strategies","Hey guys, [new article here](http://pot-stocks.com/the-long-and-short-of-it/). Text below for you non-clicking heathens. If you enjoy, be sure to subscribe.
---

When you begin to invest, one decision you will need to make is whether you want to invest short-term or long-term, or both. Either way can satisfy different goals. Both have benefits and rewards, and both can lose you money if you don’t understand the strategies behind them. They are similar of course in that you are putting your money somewhere in hopes that it will increase in value by the time you need it. Both require knowledge of the investment, but short-term investing requires knowledge of the marketplace too. Although the lines can sometimes blur between them, you might distinguish them by considering long-term as investing and short-term as trading.

Long-term stocks are ones you would hold on to for a year or more, maybe even many years, gradually earning over time. These have the potential to grow considerably, especially if you gradually add to your shares and the share price increases. Long term can even provide an income once the investment grows. These demand research so you know they are good companies and able to grow over time; however, once you invest in them, you need to follow them and track them to make sure they remain that way.

Short-term stocks are ones you would hold for less than a year, maybe even a few weeks and try to earn in a shorter time frame. Hopefully the stock will earn the amount you need within that time because the earnings period is somewhat fixed and future performance has to fall within that frame. Short-term stocks may or may not grow continuously over a long period, but they may earn money within a short period if you follow their cycles of rising and falling price. You can reap short-term earnings by buying when prices are down and selling when prices are up. (This same strategy can be used for long-term investment for protection of your principal.)

You don’t want to invest long-term in large sums just because you saw radical spikes or dips on the chart that occurred in a short period, like one or two days, but you might try buying or selling in the short-term based on them. Your trading frequency as well as your risks will increase, compared to long-term investing. Short-term trading of small-cap stocks can be very tricky for the novice. If you don’t understand why the chart is moving, you won’t be able to follow it to do shorter trades. Keep in mind that the shorter the return time you place on potential earnings, the more vigilant you will have to be to profit from it. Even the long-term stocks go up and down so you don’t want the down period to eclipse your anticipated earnings time frame.

The problem in the cannabis sector is that share prices may not be moving up and down for the right reasons. The sector cannot grow freely like other industries until federal legalization. It can’t attract large investors like other sectors because many of the companies are small and so are their share prices. On one hand this is a great time to enter, with caution and study, because the entire industry has fallen to a very low and reasonable price level after a huge explosion in early 2014. On the other hand it attracts opportunists and carpetbaggers because the reporting requirements are less restrictive at the OTC level where almost all of them trade. Behind the scenes selling and buying is not uncommon and can affect the share price. The dips and spikes here might reveal nothing more than money exchanging going on between a few of the deeper pocket investors.

So long-term investment research here would help for both long- and future short-term gains, but be patient about jumping into the short-term trading aspects of the market until you learn about the companies and more about how the market moves—not because you can’t earn money in the short-term but because the short-term gains in this sector might be artificially pumped and share prices could be moving around for reasons other than the functioning of the business.

The best you can do at the early stage of investing is focus on the legitimacy of the company and the overall quality of its business model. The amount of research needed to just vet the scams and dubious ventures in this sector would still give you valuable information, mainly that the company is not a fraud, has a real product, real business plan, and maintains transparency. Focus on that first. Once you find a few good companies you can then follow their price ebb and flow and consider them for shorter investment periods.

Either investment approach requires more study than what one can learn from a single column like this, but start with important simple distinctions like these and then refine that knowledge. It is important not to mistake one approach for the other, since that could lead to disastrous results and a loss of capital. There could be some companies that are not worth a long-term investment, but this might not be good for your short-term strategy either.

You may have to adjust your research priorities in the cannabis sector, but it helps to educate yourself first about what could be the biggest potential loss to your investment. Learning to trade with dubious company shares might not be the best way to really learn trading. Some of these companies may not even be around very long. In time the sector will stabilize and this information may not remain relevant; however, by the time this sector cleans up and increases the number of really good and growing companies, as it most definitely will, you should be in a better position. That’s the real long and short of it.

15-08-11,3gmtoi,Investing in a Automated Cash Flow Business,"When most people I know talk about investing, I rarely ever hear about investments that provide cash flow, e.g. real estate and businesses.

These can be very smart and lucrative investments that can provide a high return, be fairly low-risk and best of all they can pay you $$$ every month, while they appreciate.

In regards to real estate, single-family homes are great if you don't have a lot of funds. Lets say you have $300,000. There are 2 ways to invest this into real estate. 
1) You can pay $300,000 and get 2 homes free and clear. Then you rent them out and make $3000 a month from both for example.
2) You can finance 10 homes, rent them out, and pull in $15,000 a month, paying for the mortgages and then some nice profit as well. This is a longer term investment, as you will now have 10 properties appreciating in value versus 2.

In regards to automated businesses, there are a surprising number of businesses that buy that are already making money every month ($1000 - $50,000 and even more). Depending on how much you want to spend, you can go as high as you'd like. The strategy here is to find a business that requires very little time investment or is completely automated, other than cashing the check overseeing it. I did a little digging and found a site that seems to have a pretty accurate valuation, which I'm currently bidding on. Check it out here: https://flippa.com/5375901-rapidly-growing-1-hr-a-day-business-with-46-000-views-mo-made-3-620-in-july

Basically, you'd invest $40,000 then make $4,000 a month passively. This pays for itself fairly quickly, especially compared to real estate, and thats not taking any growth into account. Since the buyer is getting rid of it at such an early stage, I can grow it for 1-2 years, to let's say ~$20,000 a month, and flip it for well over $200,000. AND I'll be making money every month from it too.

That's just a little peak into some of my investment strategy, and I'd be happy to answer any questions you all have.

We get roughly 1,200$ - 1,500$ / month revenue from it. However we just spent 15,000$ renovating it which we already did a few years ago.

I don't get it... people say a diversified stock portfolio is easy to manage through something like vanguard, and will earn you roughly 4% profit (6.25% revenue at 2.25% inflation).

500,000 *0.04 = 20,000$ yearly profit!!! Or at 6% revenue roughly 30,000$ yearly revenue!

Any advice appreciated,"I have been propositioned on investing in a medical device company that has already completed it's 1st round of 600k 2 years ago and now are soliciting an 2nd round of 1MM for a post money valuation of 10MM.

Now I am thinking about investing 200k in this second round, but I feel that since I would be the first to invest 20% of the round with no other investors on the table right now, my gut tells me to either wait until other investors want to complete the round concurrently with my investment, or require a smaller post money valuation. 

**Any thoughts to the pro's and con's of either choice?**

I've received my undergrad in Finance and although I'm quite ignorant I know just enough to be dangerous. So with that said let me outline the company (without breaking any NDA's in the process :)

So briefly: this is a medical device company that takes components from various companies and then bundles it into their own product  The comp. advantage is that it is 1st portable iteration of the product and there are recurring revenues for the disposable portions of the product.

They are talking to hospitals and V.A.'s which have expressed some interest, but only a very small handful of purchases to date.

So that said, including but not limited to swot analysis (of which I would love to get a discussion going on this, what should I be looking for? I know that as a 2nd round of financing combined with their quite astronomical post money valuation I feel that I should be peppering questions about rounds and cost of positions as much as looking into the viability of the technology.

**Is that a good idea? Are their benefits/drawbacks into looking into the company/technology/growth as equally as important as determining the investment to equity equation on a secondary round of small company investment**

I would be ecstatic to get some input here, and without breaking any NDA's, provide as much information as possible.

1) That she doesn't miss a great investment opportunity
AND
2) She doesn't invest without fully enumerating the risk &amp; ensuring that I've performed a COMPLETE D.D.,

The strategy is currently incorporating it lowest amount of leverage since October 2013 after tracking close to its 33% maximum for over a year.  The model is still moderately positive and indicates that US equities is still an attractive class.

In addition, the Allocation’s investments in US Treasury Bonds stand at its highest level since January 2013.  Since the strategy’s benchmark is the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500, the model is indicating the Treasury Bonds could outperform equities, especially if stocks turn lower. The Allocation's overweight to technology has also risen while retaining its overweight to Finance and Health Care and underweight to Basic Materials, Energy, Real Estate (recently reduced from overweight) and Gold Mining.

It should be noted that the quantitative algorithm behind the Post-MPT Growth Allocation is totally objective and strives to predict expected returns for nine low correlated asset classes.  The expected returns are determined by assessing the changes in over a dozen economic and capital market factors.  Then the algorithm creates an optimized portfolio with the goal of producing the highest possible returns that have the lowest chance of market value declines.  So the proper way to interpret the algorithm’s current output is:

The algorithm is moderately bullish and that we could see new highs this year;

The risk for a correction has increased significantly. As of 7/7/15, the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 is only 4% off its all-time high. It could drop further if second quarter earnings announcement disappoint and foreign troubles negatively impact economic demand;

If stocks go into a correction, US Treasury bonds, at recent highs in yield, will be purchased by investors. The Federal Reserve will postpone their first increase until December at the earliest. We believe that at year-end 2016, the Federal Funds rate will stand no higher than 0.50%. If this is the case, interest rates will decline and bond prices will rise;

The Allocation is overweighting sectors with earnings visibility. It is underweighting sectors that are sensitive to economic strength or inflationary pressures.

I fell for the old pump and dump scheme on a penny stock. I read the unreasonable positive reviews on XDSL many years ago. In fact, I still have shares in this but I bought at the bottom price and have accumulated 5,000,000 shares purchased mostly at .004 to .007 cents a share. 

Interesting about this company they do have a legitimate product - batteries. I would not recommend this but after many years they are at the bottom price and no I am not starting a pump up process. 

Yes, I should move the money to a legitimate stock and may end up doing that but I am a bit of a gambler deep down so I probably will hold on to it and keep an eye on it. So I guess I am like the movie Dumb and Dumber?

  After what must have been an exhausting 18 hours, a new deal has finally been rectified with Greece, much to the apathy of the European markets. While it must be a relief for investors to be able to forget Greece exists for another few months, the country’s GDP is still expected to be between -3% and -5% for the year, says Marc Ostwald – Market strategist at ADM Investor Services. Tsipras still remains popular amongst the Greek voters, but unless something changes with their attitude towards outstanding taxes, we’re likely to see history repeating itself somewhere down the line.

	
What’s next for oil?

  In more exciting news, nobody seems to have a clue what’s happening with oil. That’s according to Ben Kumar, investment manager at Seven Investment Management, who thinks that oil is falling off a cliff and taking gold and commodities with it. With no move in OPEC, technical analysts are still increasingly moving in favour of oil prices falling towards $35, as it enters the no man’s land of sub-$40. While a resurgence could see huge profits garnered from Russian bonds, which are not-so-coincidentally linked to oil performance, there are no guarantees as oil imports across the majority of Asia have fallen. 

	
Yuan direction for Chinese currency

  However the Asian continent is facing bigger problems than oil, as the stall in the Chinese economy is having a knock on effect on other Asian currencies, and the global markets. Rather than taking the obvious approach of allowing their currency to float freely, China has begun dipping its toes into the FX markets, causing instability. A managed float, allowing 2-way volatility, would be a step in the right direction, says Jeremy Stretch – Head of G10 FX Strategy at CIBC. While their currency would devalue, China would also see a boost in exports; although this would require them to acknowledge that economies can go down, as well as up.


Sideways slump for Western markets

  Things are considerably duller on the other side of the world, with both the S&amp;P 500 and the FTSE 100 standing firm in their sideways motions. The FTSE 100, which today is still around 18% bullish, continues the trend that has persisted for just over a year now. Clive Lambert, director of FutureTechs, believes that there are buying opportunities there; but for a buy and hold approach the FTSE isn’t an attractive prospect for now.

  The S&amp;P 500, having been locked in an unprecedented period of being unable to rise or fall by more than 3%, still faces some uncertainty until the Federal Reserve begin raising the rates. Despite most predictions of a 5% fall to ~1970, John Eade, President of Argus research, has a more positive outlook, anticipating a 5% rise to optimistically finish between 6-8% for the year. However until the Fed makes its move, it’s impossible to say for certain what the impact will be on the market.

15-08-11,3glvak,SkyComm Investors Secure $19.9 Million Jury Verdict against Stock Promoter,"www.StockPromoters.com

A Texas State Court jury handed down a $19.9 million verdict against Canadian stock promoter Robert Kubbernus based upon findings of fraud and violations of the Texas Securities Act. The verdict included actual and punitive damages, and after pre-judgment interest and attorney's fees and expenses are added, the total judgment could exceed $25 million.

According to court documents, in the two and a half years after CenturyLink (NYSE: CTL) contracted to sell control of SkyComm Technologies Corp. to affiliates of Kubbernus, including Toronto-based, Balaton Group, Inc., Kubbernus raised approximately $17 million from investors from all over the world. The funds were to be used to finance the acquisition and operations of SkyComm, as well as to take the company public.

Kubbernus initially raised $7 million in ClearSky Investments, L.P., an entity he created for the stated purpose of acquiring the controlling interest in SkyComm. Investors in ClearSky were informed in the ClearSky offering documents that the agreements with CenturyLink would be assigned to ClearSky and that the controlling share interest in SkyComm would be transferred to ClearSky at the closing with CenturyLink. However, at the closing which was held on November 2, 2006, CenturyLink transferred control of SkyComm to Balaton, and not to ClearSky. Over the ensuing two years, Kubbernus sent the ClearSky investors correspondence and a financial statement that showed that ClearSky had acquired control of SkyComm. At the same time, in other documents, he stated that Balaton or ""Balaton Group, et al."" had acquired control.

After the closing, Kubbernus raised another $10 million from investors, but never disclosed to these investors that Balaton had acquired control of SkyComm using the ClearSky investors' money, and that the ClearSky investors had received nothing.

Kubbernus then made an unsuccessful effort to take the company public on the Toronto Stock Exchange and to raise even more money in the IPO. When Kubbernus' IPO plans did not work out, he filed SkyComm's operating subsidiary, SkyPort Global Communications, Inc., in Chapter 11. He submitted a plan of reorganization to the bankruptcy court that provided that all of SkyComm's shareholders, including the investors he had sold interests in the company to, would lose their shares and Balaton (and others he designated) would wind up with 100 percent of the share ownership in SkyComm.

When Adrien Pouliot, a Montreal businessman and the lead investor in ClearSky, sought to challenge Kubbernus' plan in the Bankruptcy Court, Kubbernus testified that ClearSky had no interest in SkyComm. Based on this, the bankruptcy court refused to allow Pouliot to submit his plan and the court approved Kubbernus'.

The verdict, handed down by the State Court jury on July 23, 2015, awarded $7 million in damages to the ClearSky investors, $5.9 million to the subsequent investors and $7 million in punitive damages. Sam Goldman, the lead attorney for the plaintiffs: ""We, our clients and our co-counsel are grateful to the jury for their verdict, which helps rectify a wrong that had been perpetrated on the investors in the SkyComm-related securities offered by Kubbernus. We are also grateful for the message they sent with their award of punitive damages, that frauds such as the one perpetrated by Kubbernus will not be tolerated.""

15-08-12,3go7j9,Question about Bitcoin,"I have heard so many people be bullish on Bitcoin, advocating buying it bc it is the next thing in currency.

Here is what I don't understand.

Since it is a currency, is it likely to come down a lot eventually to even out with the values of a lot of other currencies?

I know Yen is .008 to the dollar right now, so large differences can happen in the currency market, but it just seems to me that if bitcoin ever really takes hold, it would devalue down to a lot closer to the dollar, euro, and pound.

It seems to me that would ease fears to the mass markets and stabilize the price. When it is as high as it is now (269.41 with large swings in the past few years) it is difficult for people to really trust it (pure speculation, based on my own experience not really trusting it).

Am I completely off base here? Is bitcoin ever going to stabilize around it's current price, or is it going to come down a lot and stabilize to a much close 1 - 1 valuation in order to really take hold with the general public?

From my experience face-to-face with the parties to this case (GTAT -- termed, ""the Debtors"", The Bondholders (termed, ""the creditors""), and the presiding judge, it is certain that letters to the court in support of the Equity Security Holder's petition for the appointment of a Committee of Equity Security Holders will create a bigger opportunity for such a committee to be formed!

You as a shareholder of GT Advanced Technologies, et al. will then have paid legal representation during these hearings.

We all know that Tom Guttierrez shockingly and suddenly retired yesterday because he doesn't want to be called to the stand to testify if an Equity Holders committee is created.

But that does not protect us equity security holders from getting slaughtered if we fail to support the legal professionals, investment analysis profesionals, and volunteer team of equity holders who are working to get us paid representation.

15-08-11,3gm2dv,How deep should you dig for value?,"There is clearly still value to be found in the stock market but it is seemingly more difficult to locate. [Bret Jensen on Seeking Alpha](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3428196-financial-engineering-not-fundamentals-is-driving-markets?isDirectRoadblock=true&amp;source=email_rt_author_readmore&amp;app=1&amp;uprof=45) makes the point that increasingly the actual fundamental values of companies are becoming secondary concerns for investors. Governments refuse to let markets correct themselves naturally. 

Jensen writes 
&gt; I think I must be getting old. I vaguely remember a time when the market was driven by such trivial things like earnings and revenue growth, valuation, and the prospects for accelerating GDP growth. It seems that since the financial crisis, the main focus has been on what this or that central bank may or may not do in the near future.


As a long term investor this should obviously be at the forefront of one's view of the stock market. His logic makes sense to me and I see the wisdom in liquidating some positions to have  more cash on hand. I also recognize that every market has its bears that are always preaching fire &amp; brimstone. What are some key indicators or signs that I can look at to help determine whether this is wisdom incarnate or doom &amp; gloom propaganda?

I am starting to get stressed due to the fact that every retirement calculator I run has retirement earnings growing at 6-7% per year, and I am having trouble even getting 2-3%.

I bought DIS before earnings at 120, its currently at 109, so i could average it so that my average becomes 115 per share, i do see them going up but the espn subscriptions are iffy at the moment

T, VZW, GE, LMT, RAI

These 5 stocks i like because they have good dividends and are fairly stable.

 T just bought DirectTV and have a high dividend of 5% and it seems to just bounce arou d from 32 to 38 dollars. Itd be nice to buy it and forget it and collect dividends but the shares may not increase in price all that much

Vzw, the dividends are less than T at 4.xx% but it seems like they are outpacing T in growth.

GE, seems like another rock steady stock with a decent div of 3.5% but the share price doesnt really grow all that much.

LMT, lastly they have seen huge growth recently and also have a nice div of 2.xx% so i like them but theyre at an all time high right now.

RAI, i bought this at 69 and sold at 82 after earnings expecting it to dip a bit but it just kept going and now its at 86. I see them growing since they merged with lolliard and have a decent div at 2.xx% as well.

Which of these options do you guys like the best. Im torn on how to invest my money. Any thoughts opinions would be great. Maybe i should get 1 stable div stock, and 1 growth stock. For ex t or vzw and lmt or rai for growth. Let me know what you guys think",1

One of the products Sony is using their technology in has been released without MVIS's mention. [Link.](http://www.bidnessetc.com/49760-sony-corp-reveals-new-mobile-projector-for-playstation-4/)  I've read there are more Sony products to come with their technology which could make more of a splash.

It is also known they have a deal with a F500 company dealing in smartphones that is supposed to come out late this year. That's all that has been mentioned so far citing NDA's.

DO NOT SHORT THIS STOCK TODAY UNLESS YOU COVER TODAY!  If you hold through tomorrow you will owe your broker 50c share because they want that divvy!

$ENZN is a special rules special dividend.  That means if you sell before the ex-date you get a due bill and the divvy goes to the person you sold it to. 

The trick with $ENZN is the knowledge that the stock is probably going to SOAR today, but tomorrow morning it will be sold and shorted to oblivion so you have to factor potential stock losses in with your dividend gain.   But like I say, this is in my IRA so if funds get locked until price rebounds that's OK, I'm still getting a way better return that I would on TMUS.

Play it how you wish, this is a fantastic stock because it really is like playing chess to figure out how to maximize your profits.

&gt;In the case of a special dividend of 25% or more, special rules apply. If you sell stock after the record date but before the ex-dividend date, your shares will be sold with a book entry sometimes called a ""due bill,"" which denotes that though the company will pay the dividend to your account (as the shareholder of record), your account must, in turn, turn that dividend over to the buyer of your stock.

The chart below shows the trading in the S&amp;P 500 ($SPY) So far this year, the market is up 3.13 pts (not adjusted for dividends) or 1.52%, pretty unimpressive for being into the 8th month of the year.

More unimpressive than the actual change, is the range for the market, it has never been up or down more than 3.5% on a closing basis.

The range has been so flat that the volume weighted average price year to date (represented by the blue moving average on the chart) is basically flat, meaning the average price paid for SPY is right here, showing no conviction from bulls or bears. So the question is, is this accumulation before we see another drive higher, or is it distribution before the market enters a bearish phase? Unfortunately, I do not have that answer, not yet at least. Our job is to patient wait for the market to reveal itself to us and while we wait for the answer.

Either switch to trading on shorter time-frames or wait patiently in cash. Be aware of key levels of support and resistance (shown with green and red shading on the chart) and to be aware of HOW those levels may break to determine if there is enough energy stored for a real move to begin.

For now, it is a game of either short term trading or longer term patience for the market to tell us what is next.

so theoretically the gamble goes something like this: I buy a call option, 1 contract at a $150 strike price for $2 a piece which gives me a total of $200 spent for the contract. now the stock rises up to let's say $155. do I understand correctly that instead of executing the contract thus spending $15k then selling it on the market @155 a piece for $15.5k (so making $500), I just sell the option to someone for let's say $3 (making a total of $100)?

15-08-12,3gqdf0,Investing with ETF.,"Hey r/investing.

I currently have around 5000€ into a saving account that earns me around 2% per year with no risk. My desire is to invest this money into ETFs related to S&amp;P 500, as I'm willing to take more risk.

Problem is, as I currently live in France, can't invest into Vanguard funds (minimal 100.000€).

My question is how can I invest this money into ETFs with low transaction fees ?
I read on bogglehead that I should open an account using a broker. IG Market seems to be the best where I live.
As my bank is charging me around 8€ per transaction, IG Market will charge me the spread If I'm not mistaking ?
Is it more efficient that using my bank ?

I'm willing to invest monthly into the said ETF.

I'm not talking about annual fees and taxes, just transactions ones.

15-08-12,3gp6oq,Tactics for First-Time Buyers,"It was less than a year ago that Mrs Scot and I first jumped on the property ladder. While many finance bloggers preach that renting a house is far superior to buying  – After 11 months of home-ownership I can honestly say that it was the best decision ever! While technically speaking, we don’t fully own the house (the bank does for the next couple of decades) – it is an amazing feeling being able to paint, drill holes and carry-out renovations without seeking permission. Better still, there is no landlord or agency that can turn up for an inspection with 24 hours notice!
If you’re looking at buying a home and want to get your foot on the first rung of the property ladder, you’ve probably already begun viewing properties, investigating mortgage interest rates and maybe even thought about making an offer. At this point, it is important to ensure that you have considered three key things before even looking to buy: Long-Term Plan, Affordability and Exit Plan. Assuming that you have, here are three tips to help you with the next step of the process:
 
Finding a Property
Simply browsing estate agents’ windows may not find you that dream home; you have to put the effort in. This may involve widening your search and investigating your options online. Consider property comparison sites - and use many of them. Just because the ‘big’ ones don’t list a house, it doesn’t mean that it is not worth considering. While it is advantageous to have your house listed in the main directories when selling, not everyone knows about them – and not all estate agents use the comparison sites. Search the online databases of local estate agents and don’t forget about local newspapers. Consider auctions and foreclosures – more often than not, the hidden gems are the ones that you have to do a bit of looking to find!
Don’t just limit yourself to one specific area either. You may have your ideal location, but it may be worthwhile also considering alternative options at this stage. Work out a ‘zone’ where you would be prepared to commute to work from – investigate public transport links, local schools, shops, services etc. Don’t make the mistake that we did and buy a house that is one street away from a fiber-optic broadband connection!
 Tactics for First-Time Buyers
Putting in an Offer
Once you’ve found a property that’s suitable for your needs, the next step is to put in an offer. Obviously you’ll be aware of the asking price, but always try and leave some room for negotiation when putting forward an initial offer – this will leave you with the possibility of reaching some middle ground with the vendor. Most people don’t know what is the ‘expected’ discount on an offer – the truth of the matter is that there is no standard and you can negotiate until your heart’s content! We put in an offer £10,000 under the asking price (which had already been dropped £7,500). We reached middle ground and saved an additional £4000; with a bunch of appliances and furniture included – (fridge, dishwasher, bookcases, sideboard cupboards).
This is the stage when you can start to think a little tactically. Always be mindful of the circumstances of the seller as this can often create some room for manoeuvre on the price. Often sellers may need to make a quick sale and as a first-time buyer this places you in an extremely advantageous position. As you’re not involved in a chain the sale can go through quickly. Remember this and use it to your advantage when making an offer. A lower price on a quick sale may well be more attractive to the vendor.
It’s also worth bearing in mind that if you are buying property in Scotland, there is a slightly different process to follow when putting in an offer.
Another point to bear in mind is that you will often have to prove your ability to qualify for a mortgage. Pre-approvals can be obtained with a given validity and are an excellent thing to have in advance of making an offer. It will also make you a more favorable party if there are multiple offers on the table.
 
See it through
This may not be a specific tactic, but it’s still worthwhile advice. Once your offer is accepted, it really pays to be conscientious and see everything through. It’s imperative that you complete everything on time because even though your offer has been accepted you can still be ‘gazumped’. You can’t necessarily stop this happening, but by ensuring you keep up to date with your side of things, you can place yourself in the best position to avoid this. Furthermore, at this stage you have likely already occurred legal fees – being sloppy and not acting quickly can cost you a bit of cash!

15-08-12,3gqo74,Why Intel Is Still Desirable,"**Summary**

* Weak global PC demand continues to have an impact on Intel’s results.

* But the company remains a savvy capital allocator, something we like a lot.

* We're not pleased with declining year-over-year performance, but Intel's 3%+ yield is something that's simply hard to pass up.

Intel (NASDAQ:[INTC](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=intc&amp;fr=uh3_finance_web&amp;uhb=uhb2)) [reported](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/INTC/450254737x0x839417/A789A11E-3A73-485D-B9EB-69A277279A2E/Earnings_Release_Q2_2015_Final.pdf) solid results in the second quarter of 2015 on July 15, beating consensus estimates for both revenue and earnings per share. Revenue of $13.2 billion declined 5% from the year-ago period, and earnings-per-share was flat at $0.55. Net income dropped 3% in the period on a year-over-year basis. Though gross margin decreased 2 percentage points to 62.5% from the year-ago period, it was above the 62% midpoint of management's guidance. The company is executing well against its strategies, but its business is not immune to economic trends.

Weak global PC demand has had an impact on Intel's results. The firm's Client Computing Group, a combination of its former PC Client and Mobile and Communications Groups, reported revenue of $7.5 billion, down ~14% from the year-ago period. Operating profit for the group, the company's largest in terms of revenue, dropped 38% from $2.6 billion to $1.6 billion. Desktop and notebook platform volumes both dropped in the period, at rates of 22% and 11%, respectively, while tablet volumes grew 11%. Average platform selling prices declined 3% in the quarter. Growth in the firm's data center, memory, and Internet of Things [IOT] helped to offset the poor performance of PC related operations, accounting for more than 70% of operating profit in the period.

The Data Center Group, which includes server, network, and storage platforms segments, was the company's best performing group in the second quarter. It recorded revenue of $3.9 billion in the period, an increase of ~10% on a year-over-year basis due to both platform volumes and average selling prices advancing 5% in the period. Operating income in the group was flat at ~$1.8 billion, despite the strong revenue gains, due in part to higher input costs.

Also advancing revenue in the period was the company's Internet of Things Group, which grew revenue by ~4% to $559 million. Operating income for the group was flat at $145 million. The firm's software and services segment reported revenue of $534 million in the quarter, a 3% decrease from the year-ago period. This segment is not as profitable as the similarly sized IoT Group, as it reported operating income of only $14 million in the period, down from $19 million in the second quarter of 2014. These groups are not as material to operating results as the Client Computing and Data Center Groups, but we think there is noteworthy growth potential in the Internet of Things Group.

Though revenue guidance was cut from flat to a decline of 1% for full-year 2015, gross margin guidance was raised to 61.5% from 61%; guidance for R&amp;D and MG&amp;A was also increased $100 million to $19.8 billion. The firm also refined its spending budget by cutting its capital-expenditure expectations by $1 billion to $7.7 billion. Intel is looking for the launch of its most recent processor ""Skylake"" to provide exciting new PC experiences in the second half of 2015. The Microsoft Windows 10 and other new OEM systems will also help.

We aren't anticipating a large improvement in Intel's PC-related operations in the back half of 2015, but an improvement is probable. Management's guidance of revenue declining 1% for the year allows for slight improvement in top-line results from the first half. We expect full-year results to reflect management's guidance as Intel navigates the changing demand of the PC world. Though we're not pleased with declining year-over-year performance, we will continue to hold the company in both newsletter portfolios. Intel yields 3.2% at the time of this writing.

So throughout my life(I am a small business owner in my 40s), I have always strictly invested into the S&amp;P 500, and it has been very lucrative for me. I've made enough now that I could pretty much retire comfortably now, but I love what I do so I keep at it. I don't know why, but I've recently become very intrigued by the actual stock market(forgive me if I'm not using the correct terms, I never went to college for anything business related), as in buying low and selling high over the course of shorter intervals of time(1 day, week, month) as apposed to my usual strategy of letting my money grow. I've always compared it to gambling, but I want to learn the gambling, I guess. Like any sensible gambler, I've set aside a limit of $15,000 for my first foray into the stock market, but I really want to try to not lose it. I'd love some recommendation on books, tv programs, websites, articles, etc. that can help teach me the best ways to measure what makes a good stock. I don't want to go into this blind and lose my money(although I definitely except this as a possibility, which is why I set myself a limit). I'm a pretty informed guy and I already know some companies I think I would buy some stock in at some point, but I want to educate myself first. Any help and advice is welcome, please. 

Tl;Dr middle aged, well of man wants to get into short term investing after only investing in the S&amp;P 500 for many years. Wants recommendations on books, websites, etc. to read to help on this specifically.

Another company whose releases were stolen before they were made public was Marketwired.

At the very least ER should show the company has good cash reserves and won't need to dilute to raise funds.  If there was dilution from warrants, the number of warrants should go down and the cash reserves should go up.   At best the company will give some further hints as to how p2a is progressing, if p2b has started (we pretty much suspect that it has), and or partnership discussions.

It's important to know the negatives as well as the positives of your stock (especially in penny plays).  The following information has come to light that changes some of my earlier statements and research about the stock (Please note I am STILL all in on this stock):

In previous posts I mentioned conferences on 9/9 and 10/5 -- at present $AVXL is *NOT* scheduled to speak at these, its a possibility but its not official until they announce.   I apologize and will do my own checks in the future to ensure they have been announced by the company and/or scheduled.  We do know there will most likely be initial results presented and final p2a data should be announced by the end of the year.  But there's no narrow time-line for that to happen.

Further, there was a post on ihub today which explored the patent issue previous covered by a [seeking alpha article](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3354385-anavex-may-actually-cure-alzheimers).   [One of the paragraphs](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1314052/000106299313006497/exhibit10-82.htm) section 2.5 used by the article to dismiss the outstanding claim against $AVXL was _deleted_ in [an addendum](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1314052/000106299313006497/exhibit10-81.htm) filed in 2012.

Does this mean an upside of 1000+% for TPIV once they get results? 

The consensus on this board (lol) was that we'd start seeing catalysts soon and hat they'd rocket the share price to the $2+ range (but this was when there were about 40% less outstanding shares). Is this a good time to get in TPIV or are things going to remain bumpy? There's still a possibility of warrants getting exercised, potentially adding another 100m shares and diluting this stock to shit.

They acquired Talisman last year when oil prices were higher and that has taken a hit on this quarter's results both on revenue and having payed a bit too much on today's terms. This has lead to a drop to just under 15 euros. However, mid-term the company has good price increase potential if oil prices increase?

BME:SAN Santander: Relatively stable stock with good dividend yields until recently (Jan 2015), reason why the stock is underpriced.

15-08-13,3guqcj,Why does the Owner Earnings calculation exclude payment of debt principal?,"So I understand the thinking behind the basic owner earnings calculation (NI + Dep/Amort +/- certain noncash charges - capex - required changes in working capital): this is the cash flow from the business that goes to the owners/equity holders, thus should (in the long run) determine the ultimate value of the equity.
However, I've had one question (and it's been nagging me for awhile): how does the repayment of debt principal factor in here? 

To me, debt holders have two claims on the total earnings of a business: interest (which is accounted for in owner earnings via net income, which includes interest expense) and repayment of debt principal (which, based on the equation above, is not factored in).

Thus, why does owner earnings ignore debt principal repayment? 

To me this is overstating the cash flows attributable to the equity holders by the amount of debt principal repaid in a year.",3

The consensus seems to be that this third “one-off” devaluation may not be the last as the markets continue to heap pressure on the currency to fall. I have head analysts say that the currency needs to fall 10 times further than it already has. Nevertheless, the PBoC remains adamant that the Yuan will not be devalued further, nor does it need to be.

The chatter around China will remain and USD will continue to be pressured as the expectations for an early Fed rate hike pare back.

The commodity slump can be credited to China to a larger extend (demand/supply gap), and now this whole fiasco of devaluation means that Asian countries and forex might be in for a surprise ahead.

15-08-13,3gusbt,FIENX as (part of?) a VGTSX surrogate in a 401(k),"Hello all,

I'm considering how to allocate my 401(k) and I've decided to do an S&amp;P fund and a small cap fund to roughly approximate total US stock (VTSMX), which is unavailable.  

For international exposure, it seems as though FIENX roughly tracks VGTSX. Could I go with a similar approach and use FIENX and a small cap fund? There is only one foreign small/mid cap fund in my choices(TIGVX), and it has a 1.5% ER so I'd rather not.

What I'm considering (24 years old, risk tolerant):

40% FUSEX

10-15% NAESX

20% FIENX/Other international exposure

10% FBTTX (Biotech, could go 15%)

10% Bonds

I'm also open to having a US mid cap in addition to FUSEX and NAESX, or allocating differently.

I have been checking companies out and there are some awesome companies that spit out huge amounts of cash yet because their fluctuating revenues and net income, they are dropping in stock price. IBM is one example I believe to be a amazing company. 
Like when I first started I looked for companies that had amazing net income and EPS growth numbers. I've got good gains from them in terms of stock price appreciation over a period of 2 years. Their cash flow numbers aren't very convincing and in terms of cash, their cash position hasn't increased much yet it seems that the driver in the price has been due to its EPS/Net income and some of these stocks have appreciated more than I believe is reasonable. Around 30-90%. 
So my question is, do long term stock price based on cash flow numbers or is It a eps/net income game? The cash flow stocks that I like haven't risen much yet they hold quite a considerable amount of cash in terms of market cap and they are BORING, Woohoo, yet they have managed to create positive amount of cash and plenty left to repurchase stock.

15-08-13,3gv41y,RNA drug discovery YOLO play: Marina Biotech (MRNA),"Alright you fucking johnnies. I've been cooking this one for a very long time. To start, I am long about 45 grand worth of shares at a loss and average cost of 60 cents per share. I am trying to get more shares to take my position to 100k USD. I think the payoff is more than worth it. Of course, getting filled on this thing is a bitch.

You won't be front-running me, because I have to call in and tell my brokerage to somehow scale me in over time.

When I look at the Marina Biotech pipeline, all I see is grossly undervalued fatty medicines full of bottles and models. The company is a very honest one, you can call the CEO and he will talk to you. 

They have had a chain of bad luck + failures time and time again, but Steven T. Newby just funded the company for 1M. This will keep the company afloat until mid 2016, possibly end of 2016.


Now, I know you fuckers are going to be all: But Simon, Frost was also a biotech billionaire, but ATNM shit the bed!. Aha! Steven is different. Steven is a yolo-er just like us. He rose from retail trading after retiring from his job as a broker. He is also a 6 time winner of the CNBC top trader.


But just to make you sure that we are going to get yachts from Marina Biotech in a year's time, let me show you Newby's positions at 2013, keep in mind that he controls at least 1% of stock in all of these companies, if not more:

His thesis on Tekmira in 2013 (a 100%+ gain by now): 

&gt;My thesis is TKMR is a well financed, sub $100M m/c company with a change-the-world technology. I'm a long term investor who seeks 5-10X+ returns, and in doing so have my share of failures. I follow and agree with Dirk that TKMR needs to move toward drug development, like Arrowhead, to create investor interest. Hoping for some new partnerships soon. I do not have a medical background (except I grew up next to NIH) but owned my own brokerage firm, Newby &amp; Company (MM ID: GURU), from 1990-2005. Been on CNBC and other financial shows lots of times. Current largest holdings: ECYT, ACAD, ONTY, MOR.DE, TKMR. ONTY is worth a speculative look right here. Steve

Blizzard in the near future will be releasing an expansion for Hearthstone a very profitable game, as well as a new World of Warcraft expansion which always boosts their sales figures and subscriptions, Heroes of the Storm their foray into MOBA games will be out of open beta soon and is already generating sales in beta, as well as their brand new IP Overwatch which has some hype building and should be entering beta soon.

As well if recent history is any indication Blizzard has been listening more to what their customers want and meeting those needs, after initial backlash to Diablo 3 Blizzard has made monumental work to regain some fans of the series, and StarCraft 2 still has an active userbase. 

As for Activision I admit I don't know as much about them although they are a huge publishing company and have the Skylanders IP which I've heard is the new Pokemon to children of today. 

I'm not certain but I think this stock will continue to climb, at least over the next year and was wondering if anyone else had thoughts on this? Sorry if I seem very dumb, I also am obviously just going off of layman's information as I admittedly don't know much about finances.",7

* Debt: None
* Other savings or investments: 3-5 months emergency savings that is not invested in any of these accounts. Own my vehicle in full (~6-7k value if I had to sell it ASAP).
* Goals: Be as prepared for retirement as much as possible, and start to get a nest egg together for my near future adventures. Honestly I don't anticipate buying a home for another 3-5 years as I am still single and don't expect that my current job location is where I want to anchor myself. I've been working since I was 12-13 on a farm, so I may want to save up enough money to be able to take a year off and go on an adventure around the world.

Stryker (SYK)- seems to always have been a good performer and is trending up at the moment. With a short month time frame something like this seems a good way to go, but with my luck it will correct itself as soon as I buy.

Amgen (AMGN)- has dipped a little recently, and may spring back up. Also a good performer. Although it is currently sitting at what I see as a little bit of a resistance line at ~170.

Biomet (ZBM)- I expect them to become a much stronger company post-merger. Lower than it's been in a while and I believe if they can show that the merger was a pro, it will rise.

15-08-14,3gx8h8,$ENZN special dividend play -- results.,"$ENZN was paying a special rules dividend of 50c/share, the ex-date was today.   If you don't know a special rules dividend applies when the dividend is &gt; 25% of the share price and if you sell your shares after the record date but BEFORE the ex-date, you pass your dividend on to the person who purchased your shares.   (sell with a due bill).

I purchased a 20k block last week when it was at 1.36/share in my IRA (important otherwise it would be taxed as income).   This morning I verified with fidelity the 10k dividend was in my account (paid to cash, not re-invested -- also important).   I was prepared to have to wait to sell the shares for a few months (again IRA), but the stock almost immediately rebounded to the 1.20's where it stayed for most of the day.   I sold at 1.25 for an .11c/share loss, but factoring the divy I made a relatively easy and painless .39c share.  Which means my IRA portfolio is doing rather a bit more nicely than it was two weeks ago.

I don't play shorts but if I did I'd have learned to not short and hold through the close the day before the ex or you owe your broker the dividend (ouch!) and do not short the next morning because a lot of people forget to turn off dividend re-investment.

The only thing I didn't factor in was the dividend re-investment that most people had, so that pushed the share price back up as those dividends went back into purchasing more stock.

Puts/calls/longs/shorts/dividends they're all part of the game.   Special rules special dividends are extremely rare, but played well they are also pretty darn safe and lucrative.",2

Considering that HTC are partnering with the geniuses at Valve and taking into account that their headset has not only been reviewed as the best but also releases commercially first (end of this year). 

Releasing their headset at its quality early will put them out in the market first so I can only see HTC go up after that.

15-08-14,3gxab6,What do you think of this strategy?,"My Theory:

Simultaneously short the bull and bear halves of a triple-leveraged ETF equal amounts when they are both trading higher than typical in relation to their NAV. Sell after 6 months, and wait for your next good opportunity relative to the NAV. And don't use funds that follow wildly volatile commodities.

For example: SPXL &amp; SPXS. Do this for the last 6 months, and one is down 2%, the other 6% - for an average 4% gain. TMF &amp; TMV: down 3% &amp; 11%, for a 7% gain. 

This isn't a theory to make you rich overnight, but if the market averages 7% a year historically, this is a bit better - and with hedges going both directions, it has a level of safety to it as well.

I am just learning to invest and I have read Intelligent Investor. Now, I am reading Pat Dorsey's ""The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing"".

* **DOV** - Dover corporation. Free cash flow / revenue is at least 10 % for the last 5 years and ROA, ROE are solid too. Quite wide variety in products: products for energy, engineering, food companies etc.
* **KB** - KB Financial Group Inc. Free cash flow / revenue is at least 6 % for the last 5 years [except 2013] and ROA, ROE are solid too. Also, it's well established and dominant company in South Korea.
* **POT** - Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.  Free cash flow / revenue is around 20 % for the last 5 years and ROA, ROE are solid too. Big share in its industry and the fact that it produces fertilizers and similar products means it's related to food industry, which is less volatile in the market.

I'm an internet marketer and the only real stocks I follow are tech stocks. I am interested in more info on two companies.

1 - [Shopify.](http://www.shopify.com) They just went public and they shot up pretty quick, but not as quick as I thought they would. My little knowledge tells me this is a good long-term buy because online e-commerce (that's what Shopify is, an e-commerce web platform where people can build their own stores) is only going to continue to grow and Shopify seems to really be the market leader. What should I look for in terms of knowing if I should buy some stocks or not?

2 - Digital music

More specifically, music streaming. As big as iTunes is you still have to purchase every song and everything points to that slowly being a thing of the past as opposed to monthly subscription services that pay the artist per song play. The obvious example is [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com) (note this is different from Shopify which was listed above.) They did 30 M in Q1 I think and it is a Sean Parker brain child which means it will be a powerhouse in the web 2.0 world for years to come.

Truthfully I don't really have a specific question, I am young and own a successful business so I am not looking to get rich quick. I'm looking for some conversation as to what I should look for in a long-term buy?

CC also suggests that seasonality in Q4 will bring significant, predictable headwinds, raising cost of revenue and slowing growth.

15-08-14,3gzcn5,Three Maryland Men Settle on Real Estate Investment Fraud,"www.StockPromoters.com

Apparently, James R. Glover orchestrated fraud by enticing family, friends, and fellow church members to become his clients at Boston-based Signators Inc. and invest in Colonial Tidewater Realty Income Partners, which he co-managed. Most of Glover’s clients were financially unsophisticated and relied on him for investment guidance. Some even described him as “another dad” or “part of the family.” 

“Glover lied to unsuspecting members of his close-knit religious community and preyed upon the trust they placed in him as their registered representative,” said Sharon B. Binger, Director of the SEC’s Philadelphia Regional Office. 

According to the SEC’s complaint filed in federal court in Baltimore against Colonial Tidewater, Glover, and Colonial Tidewater’s co-manager Sherman T. Hill:

·         Glover steered approximately 125 clients to purchase partnership units in Colonial Tidewater. 
·         Glover and Hill provided false and misleading written statements about Colonial Tidewater’s value and financial condition.
·         Glover lied to investors about the liquidity of Colonial Tidewater’s investments and the expected returns. 
·         Glover and Cory D. Williams, his business partner in Signator’s Maryland office, did not inform clients that they received undisclosed commissions from Colonial Tidewater when clients invested in the company, thus failing to disclose conflicts of interest.
·         Glover misappropriated hundreds of thousands of dollars of investor funds.
According to an SEC order instituting a settled administrative proceeding against Signator and Gregory J. Mitchell, who was a supervisor in Signator’s Maryland office:
·         Signator and Mitchell failed to identify and prevent the alleged fraud conducted by Glover and Williams.
·         Signator failed to have reasonable policies and procedures governing consolidated reports, which could be used to combine all of a client’s financial holdings in a single report.   
·         Glover, without Signator’s knowledge, inserted clients’ Colonial Tidewater holdings into the consolidated reports to create the false impression that Colonial Tidewater was a Signator-approved investment when it was never authorized for sale by Signator representatives. 
·         Rather than following Signator’s policies and procedures, Mitchell routinely allowed Glover and Williams to select client files for his review or he provided them a pre-selected list of names of client files to be reviewed, enabling them to remove all references to Colonial Tidewater investments before Mitchell reviewed the records. 

“Signator and Mitchell failed to conduct the thorough reviews necessary to catch Glover and Williams in the act of defrauding investors,” said Ms. Binger.

Colonial Tidewater, Glover, and Hill agreed to settle the SEC’s charges without admitting or denying the allegations, and consented to the appointment of a receiver to take control of Colonial Tidewater.  Under settlements that are subject to court approval, Colonial Tidewater would be required to pay $527,844 in disgorgement, $66,542 in prejudgment interest, and a $725,000 penalty.  Glover agreed to be barred from the securities industry and pay $839,128 in disgorgement, $64,977 in prejudgment interest, and a $450,000 penalty.  Hill agreed to pay a $75,000 penalty. 

In a separate SEC order, Williams agreed to settle charges that he violated provisions of the Investment Advisers Act. Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, he agreed to be barred from the securities industry and pay $94,191 in disgorgement, $9,854 in prejudgment interest, and a $94,191 penalty. 

Signator and Mitchell agreed to pay penalties of $450,000 and $15,000 respectively without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings. Signator agreed to be censured and Mitchell agreed to be suspended from acting in a supervisory capacity for one year.

I dont think I can take screenshot, well, maybe I can blur all the important stuff out....

With MyMerill access Ive seen all the transactions and activity. My FA has said that in my personal account no action on anything will be made until me and him discuss every move. Is this how I should do it? I'd like the investments to be working, and I'll at least know in a month or two if there coming close to that.


So what do I need to look at for my reports? I see unrealized gains and losses (very little considering its been about a week) what other reports should I ask to be posted?

And most importantly, how can I use the information based on how my FA is investing to best direct my own investing experience.

It was my intention on starting a small vanguard account and mimic these investments to see how hard the expense ratio really is. Is that wise? I was going to use maybe 10,000 in a vanguard. And now that all of my investments are in the market, I am scared of having all of them be in there. But other stories, apologies getting off track.


So what reports do I need, can I create a portfolio based on my FAs for a self directed vanguard account and see the difference in fees? And what else can I do to find out and learn anything else?

My FA has been very helpful, I'm just not sure what to ask without getting some kind of silly answer that will cause me to ask a rude question.




Also, for those were curious my Merill fee is abaseline 1.25% for the advisor, and then seems to fluctuate with other purchases etc. So far I haven't seen it go above 1.69% however like mentioned it did say it could go up to 3.7....",5

15-08-14,3gzhyn,"A Stock's Constant Change in Price","I've been dabbling in the stock market for a few years now. I've taken a few college macro/micro courses and even a few finance courses. I've read a few of the popular investing books such as ""A Random Walk Down Wall Street"" and took a stab at ""The Intelligent Investor"". I've spent time reading up on the magic of technical analysis and the millions of chart theories out there. 

I'm not telling you this to boast, but to give you an understanding of where I'm coming from. I like to think that I'm not completely ignorant to the concepts and that I have a decent understanding of the market and the key variables that play a role. However, I've always been curious as to the constant change in price of a stock. 

So, my question is... What the hell causes the second-to-second, even millisecond-to-millisecond change in price of a stock. I understand when news comes out about the company or when it's earnings season, but on a slow day, what causes this? Is it mainly driven by the volume of shares being sold/bought? I get the concept of market movers and that when a mutual fund manager makes a decision to sell/buy, it has a much larger impact than a few kids playing around on the Internet, but it's not like money managers are making trades of the same stock multiple times an hour, or even a day, are they? What about less active stocks? I still see low volume stock prices change every second... Why!? Am I missing something here?

15-08-14,3gyef7,Pay back loans or invest in stocks/funds?,"Hi guys.

I've recently graduated uni, and while I've got roughly $40k in student debt, I have about half that (20k) sitting in my bank account. I'm considering what my best option is; pay some of the loan back, or invest it?

These are the facts: 

- My student loan's interest rate is only at 2%(!)
- The interest is currently frozen at 0% and doesn't start ticking for another 6 months.
- I might go back to uni for a master's degree in 12 months, meaning the interest will be re-frozen to 0% for 2 more years.

In other words, the loan isn't really growing at the moment, and won't start to grow for a few years.

I realize that in some cases, one should pay back one's loans before even considering investing in stocks or funds. However, given the specifics of my situation, and considering how cheap my loan is, wouldn't you think that investing the cash in an index/mutual fund, or stocks would be worth the risk?

With yearly returns of 7% (deducting 29% taxation) that would yield a return of $3195 over 3 years. A return of 12% would yield a return of ~$5700. All the while, those 6 months of interest on the loan would cost me only $400.


Do you think investing the cash is justifiable?",18

Anyway, I looked up the stock assuming it was just a random tip that would lead to nothing, and initially it appeared that was the case. MNKD is rated fairly poorly, posting a quarterly loss, and sub par returns the past year or so. However, looking up articles there are a fair amount that say a new insulin drug they're rolling out may eventually be a game changer.

15-08-14,3h035a,Equity Committee hearing coming up in major bankruptcy tied to $APPL ($GTATQ),"EQ Holders Must Bleed Together

There are some equity holders on this board who have not printed up and mailed this very important supporting document at http://www24.zippyshare.com/v/uLhzJPau/file.html
 (Support for Appointment of Equity Committee)

and the deadline is quickly approaching.

Let's look at the facts.

People SUPPORT the equity committee:

•Dr. Nidal Abdel-Rahman, MD, Medical Practitioner, Assistant Professor of Clinical Anesthesiology

•Paul E. Boldt

•F.C. Salzmann

•Chad Cooper

•Members of the Equity Committee itself, among them counted:

•The Honorable Doug Southard, retired federal judge.

•Professional and family man Nathan Cottrell

•Mike Willingham

**Mike Willingham's membership is of special interest.** He is the legendary pro-se filer who lead a team of men and women in the fight for equity holders after the historic bankruptcy of Washington Mutual during the 2008 global financial crises.

Mike and his team's work resulted in tens of millions of dollars of equity shares being preserved. Those few millions of dollars of equity is now worth over $500,000,000 dollars and retain claims to billions of dollars of assets. 

The $WMIH case is largely settled, and equity holders were successfully preserved.

Join the real hustlers who are putting in work. Don't cow-tow to the opinions of king(queen)pins of message boards who cloak and subvert with downvotes on messages that they disagree with.

There is a pending hearing on the 27th of August 2015 for what will likely be the final opportunity for Shareholders (termed in federal bankruptcy cases as ""Equity Security Holders"") to achieve representation during this case! This case is 9 months in and the first ""Plan of Reorganization"" -- the final step to exiting bankruptcy -- will soon be filed.

From my experience face-to-face with the parties to this case (GTAT -- termed, ""the Debtors"", The Bondholders (termed, ""the creditors""), and the presiding judge, it is certain that letters to the court in support of the Equity Security Holder's petition for the appointment of a Committee of Equity Security Holders  will create a bigger opportunity for such a committee to be formed!

You as a shareholder of GT Advanced Technologies, et al. will then have paid legal representation during these hearings.

If we fail to support the legal professionals, investment analysis professionals, and volunteer team of equity holders who are working to get us paid representation (the aforementioned professionals have worked since Februrary, completely pro-bono so far), what are we but worms waiting to be eaten by the bureaucratic machine?

Therefore, if you are a shareholder in $GTATQ, it is in your best interest to download this Wordpad document and print it. Read the document and put your name on it. Then Date and Sign the document. Write the address of the document onto a normal letter-sized envelope with a U.S. Postal Service stamp. Finally, place the document into the envelope and mail it.

Do this today or your letter will not arrive in time to be considered during the August 27th hearing.

15-08-14,3h0hnn,My 4-fund diversified bond portfolio,"After reading [this article](http://seekingalpha.com/article/1549382-how-to-construct-a-diversified-bond-portfolio-for-retirees) on Seeking Alpha, I realized that there is something to be gained by not just dumping my entire bond allocation into VGs [Total Bond Fund](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0584&amp;FundIntExt=INT), but instead dividing it between a variety of solid funds and then rebalancing at the end of each year. This allows for diversification, which is pretty much the only free lunch available in investing. Think: increased returns with decreased volatility! [Win win](https://youtu.be/Q8I8U_HfUQ8?t=41s).

Here they are:

* 25% Intermediate Term Government Bonds ([VSIGX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=1943&amp;FundIntExt=INT)) Avg maturity: 5.6 years
* 25% Intermediate Term Corporate Bonds ([VICSX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=1946&amp;FundIntExt=INT)) Avg maturity: 7.5 years
* 25% Intermediate Term Municipal Bonds ([VWITX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0542&amp;FundIntExt=INT)) Avg maturity: 8.7 years (I'm in the highest tax bracket)
* 25% GNMA Mortgage Backed Security Fund ([VFIJX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0536&amp;FundIntExt=INT)) Avg maturity: 6.9 years

The goal is to add some uncorrelated assets to my stock portfolio. In this falling interest rate environment, I don't feel long term bonds or junk bonds are very good investments. Stocks historically have better returns with lower standard deviation. And short-term bonds are almost a cash investment, in my eyes. I might as well keep the money in an Ally savings account earning 1% risk-free. But intermediate term bonds seem a great middle ground. They seem a decent bet to beat inflation, and possess enough oomph to potentially offset stock market losses.

I'm really happy that I went this route instead of just dumping everything into Total Bond.

Note: My allocation is 24% bonds 76% stocks. This is an ideal ratio for my age/life situation.",3

15-08-14,3h0lym,How do you value growth stocks?,"As the title states I am interested in how people value stocks with lots of potential growth, whether it be in the tech industry, bio chem, w/e. 

I have read multiple books on value investing and most of my investments are in these types of companies. Proven track record, low p/e, consistent dividends, etc. these valuations make more sense to me as the companies have a more predictable future cash flow and usually have assets +cash to back up the valuation. Buying companies with high P/E ratios and little history to back up the valuations kinda baffles me.

But I want to start diversifying my portfolio a bit and taking on some more risk. I am young and have plenty of time to ride the ups and downs of Mr. Market.

15-08-15,3h1i0h,"HELP! I've been offered ""warrants"" for a new job. Are they worthless?","Hi everyone, I'm currently negotiating a contract/consultant position with a tech start up company in San Francisco.  They're a very young company.  They've raised about $8 Million in ""convertible debt"" from a variety of investors.  They have a really compelling concept and, if well designed and executed, it is quite feasible to imagine them being acquired by a larger tech company in a few years or even perhaps going public in 5+ years.  Of course, it's equally feasible to imagine them going belly up if they don't meet their revenue goals in the next couple of years.  

My assignment is for 6 months on a month-to-month contract.  They're offering a good (but not great) pay rate so they have offered to supplement the pay with 3,500 warrants, to be issued upon completion of my project.  After doing a bit of reading I have a general idea of how warrants work and how they differ from ""regular"" stock options.  But, practically speaking, I'm wondering if these warrants have any potential to have value in the future.  


Firstly, in the first draft of the contract, they've only listed the number of warrants they'll be issuing me, not the strike price, nor the expiration date.  Is it unreasonable of me to expect this information to be included in the contract?  


Secondly, help me walk through some scenarios:

- What happens if, two years from now, they are acquired by a larger company and I haven't exercised the warrants?  Are the warrants instantly invalidated?  Do they transfer into stock options for the new parent org?  

- What if the company never goes public and stays private?  Do the warrants have no value?  Is there such a thing as exercising a warrant for a privately held company?

I don't see the price impact being huge, but if exchange causes movement of stored oil could this raise the overall oil supply? I remember reading about the filling of American oil storage threatening to slow oil production. If we're exporting excess light crude to import heavy will this swap raise supply?

Is this loosening of oil exports a sign congress may be more keen on lifting the ban?",2

I would want lowest fees. I don't mind commission per trade being around 10 bucks, so the 5-12usd range is fine.

I do some light day trading. (1-2 max a day, usually 1-2 every 1-2 weeks, AKA not a lot but still in short term range.)

 I started because of the following reasons.

1. I have a B.S. in International Economics from Texas Tech
2. I invest in E&amp;P companies
3. I have four years experience working completions[frac jobs] in the oil industry, primarily the Permian Basin/Midland-Odessa of Texas
4. I have a lot of time on my hands while at work that doesn't interfere with my work quality and I can still watch/act on the market movements.

So far I think TradeKing is my best bet but not sure.
Maybe Cobra Trading

1) Buy the Dip

2) Don't Try and Catch a Falling Knife

My question to everyone is, at *what point from now* would your mentality change from that of ""buy"" to that of ""hold"", and at what point would ""hold"" turn in to ""sell"", if at all? How much would the market need to move in what amount of time, or what things would need to happen to change your outlook?

Seeing the responses in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3h0rb0/given_the_current_state_of_the_market_if_you_had/) made me curious about what it would take for the majority of the posts to be really bearish or more cautious than they currently are (which is surprisingly cautious for /r/investing...). 

My Answer: Sold everything about 3.5 weeks ago. Move / Home purchase is in the future so taking gains, having liquidity, and minimizing risk for the time being was essential. China / Greece gave me some reassurance it was the right more (liquidated more than I needed for the down payment). I was more worried about protecting against a near term catastrophic loss than missing out on any gains. I told myself when I get back in I'll add 7% / year to my principal and basically pay myself ""interest"" so I don't fall behind. It would probably take a ~30% dip (from here) and/or the passing of the first rate hike and the following correction and/or a slow climb to 2200 on the SPY (over 5-7 months without much volatility). If it dips below 2050 again soon I think it's time to watch out...

Investing noob here (read: tear my opinion to pieces), so I wanted to get your thoughts on IP. A dividend strategy seems to fit my personality, so I'd like to see if on track with this one. Here are my points of interest which are making this stock looking enticing:

- Continual dividend payment (past 10+ years)
- Steady increase in dividend yield for past 4+ years. Initial investment at current market price would appear to yield 4% dividends by 2016.
- Current market price finding support at 47.00 and forming new base
- Limited exposure to strong dollar (70% of revenue from within US)
- Management focusing on reducing operational costs. (Good protection against future economic uncertainty?)

Oddly prescient and spillover effects into commodity based economies. May still be a trade here given the uptick in volatility and potential effects of a rate rise into developing countries. The question is whether or not the rate rise will be priced in, or if it matters as the rise could be such a large macro driver that will recreate the below even if on a smaller scale.

This compounded with China's woes could be devastating for developing economies in the region.

""The boom in Third World bank-syndicated loans in the 1970s followed a sharp decline in interest rates on U.S. dollar securities in the spring of 1970 as the Federal Reserve adopted a more expansive policy. Banks were highly liquid and looked for attractive borrowers which they found in Third World governments and government-owned firms, mostly in Latin America. The 1960s had been a decade of accelerating internationalization for the major U.S. banks and they had rapidly increased the numbers of their foreign branches. Because of the sharp increase in commodity prices, nominal incomes and real incomes in Mexico, Brazil, and most other developing countries were increasing at above trend rates. Commodity prices declined sharply in the early 1980s in response to the surge in U.S. interest rates, and then nominal and real incomes declined in the developing countries. Should the banks have foreseen that the decline in commodity prices was inevitable?”

15-08-16,3h6dbz,"Understanding bond funds' coupon rates","I'm trying to get a good grasp of bond funds. One of the questions is why the dividend yield of a bond fund != coupon rate.


Taking VCAIX as an example, it has issued 0.0270 of dividends every month, giving it a yearly yield of ~2.76%.  However Vanguard reports the (weighted?) average coupon is 4.7%.  Where's the disparity of 2% coming from? 


From what I understand, MFs/ETFs are supposed to distribute coupons back to the shareholders in the form of dividends, so it stands to hold that the coupon rate should be equal to the div rate.

My theory on the matter is that div yield is calculated as a percentage of the NAV, where as coupon is a percentage of the bond principal/par value (not sure what the correct term is).  So if the NAV is taking into account all future coupon payments, it makes sense that the div yield is smaller than the coupon rate.  

Am I offbase here?

I thought this made sense until I looked at [FMIFX](http://portfolios.morningstar.com/fund/summary?t=FMIFX&amp;region=usa&amp;culture=en_US), which holds bonds that all mature in 2017.  So ideally the NAV should be fairly close to the par value.  Even with this fund, the dividend yield is nowhere close to the average coupon rate of 4.64%.

15-08-15,3h4ehf,What will need to occur for oil price to rise again?,"Hello all,

I am business professor that specializes in business strategy and innovation. That being said, I do fairly well investing in technology firms. I live in an area with a lot of energy companies and interested in learning more about the sector. Since the US economy is growing slowly, I'd expect prices to stabilize/increase but they are not. Therefore, a lot of people are losing jobs in my city and the job prospects for my students are not great. 

From people who understand the energy industry, what more is there to know than simply supply vs. demand economics? Is solar as a substitute really hurting oil? Examining the solar industry, they are hurting as well since oil is cheap and therefore people are not incentivized to switch. Any information would be helpful. ",6

15-08-16,3h6fo3,Start up or property? Index fund or margin loan?,"I'm 28 and don't have any savings. Most of my twenties was spent having fun (living overseas, spending money on experiences, etc.). I don't regret any of it but now I feel like I need to start thinking about my financial future. Thankfully I have a good paying job and can save about $3,000 a month.

My goal is to save a large chunk of money to do one of two things:

1. Have one or two years living expenses so I quit my job and work full time on creating my own business. I know this is very risky and 90% of businesses fail. It may not make a lot of financial sense to people, but I am not risk averse. As far as I see it, the downside is limited and the potential upside is huge. More than just the financial gains, I want to self-actualise, create something special, push myself to new heights, etc.

2. Save enough for a house deposit, take the conventional path and buy my own home, work for the man, etc.

For option 1, I reckon I could live off $700 a week including rent which is 36k in savings per year.

For option 2, I'd imagine I'd want 20% of a deposit so around 100k for a 500k home in Sydney/Melbourne.

My question is, besides saving the money each pay and putting it in a high interest savings account, is there any other investment type I should be considering?

I'm young and so happy to take on some risk... I was considering index funds on the one hand, but I am also comfortable with leverage so I was also considering a margin loan.

As for which option I'm leaning towards, if it wasn't clear above I am really leaning towards option 1 but that may change if there is a correction in the real estate market and so I can snap up something great. It also depends on whether I have an idea I'm passionate about working on full time and so on.

I am open to all types of advice.

15-08-16,3h6gj2,"Twitter's Stock is Now $29.07. Buy?","When I searched for Twitter-stock posts I only found two and they were 3 months old. But what surprised me is that when people were asked whether it's time to buy Twitter or not, most people said it's not making money or that Twitter is not as popular as it used to be. That's fine, but what's confusing is what made these people think this way. 

Twitter IS making money out of ads, but it's not making enough.
Twitter IS popular, but it's not seeing a user-base growth.
Twitter will NEVER make you, the user, pay money to follow topics or something, but it will charge companies, politicians, celebrities, if they wanted special coverage; which, hopefully, makes Twitter come up with new products and ways to showcase these events in order to tempt these companies to pay more for Twitter.

Now, what do you guys think about the stock today? It went down to $26 around a week ago, so I'm worried that the ship has sailed.",25

I want my money to be quickly accessible so I can disengage it / Reengage it to capture gains/avoid losses. 
I would want lowest fees. 
I don't mind commission per trade being around 10 bucks, so the 5-12usd range is fine. 
I ONLY do straight stock trades. 
No options/mutual funds/forex I think... as I am a newbie.... I would also need easy documentation for tax purposes. 
This will be my first year paying capital gains/loss on my trading activity. I want that to be as smooth as possible. I will be getting a CPA for taxes this year, previously used TurboTax and did it myself.


I will have between 2500-10000usd in the account.
I do some light day trading. (1-2 trades max a day, usually 1-2 trades every 1-2 weeks, AKA not a lot but still in short term range.)


I started because of the following reasons.
I have a B.S. in International Economics from Texas Tech.
I invest in E&amp;P companies.
I have four years experience working completions[frac jobs] in the oil industry, primarily the Permian Basin/Midland-Odessa of Texas.
I have a lot of time on my hands while at work that doesn't interfere with my work quality and I can still watch/act on the market movements.

So far I think TradeKing is my best bet but not sure. Maybe Cobra Trading

Any advice is welcome!! Please help!

Hoping this was the right subforum, also posting in r/Investment

e: I have robinhood but was told it took 2-3 days for funds to clear trades. This doesn't work for me as sometimes I enter/exit on the same day.



e2: I am going to be calling a good friend with 4 years experienced for JP Morgan today to clear up some confusion I believe is here due to terminology. Will update thread when I can more clearly explain myself.

I looked up margin accounts, PDT, and margin trading. As far as I know, I am not a margin trader, I do not trade on margin, nor have I done so. I have the cash backing up all trades I made. All trades I made/make have the equity/cash inside my brokerage account to back them up.


e3: I have a cash account, I want to stay cash account. PDT will apply to me. I do not have the funds to enter into margin trading nor the desire.

I am probably just needing to decide between tradekings and tradestation. They all seem the same cost wise just need to look into their tools and layouts and which one I enjoy.

15-08-16,3h92hm,An Introduction to Contrarian Investing,"In the last post we just concluded our Trend Following series. Now, we’re going to cover a new investment strategy that has worked exceptionally well across various markets (stocks, commodities, currencies) since the 2008 market crash. This strategy is known as Contrarian Investing. Contrarian Investing is exactly what it sounds like – if everyone else is selling and the market crashes, you should buy into the market. If everyone else is buying and the market spikes, you should sell the market. Contrarian investing is based on a simple tenet: the crowd (when it moves in one distinct direction) is always wrong.

Obviously, this belief is not 100% true. What makes Contrarian Investing truly successful is that this investment strategy rests on a simple fact of the universe: mean reversion. When things go to one extreme, they will reverse towards the mean and go the other way. This also aligns itself with the concept of cycles. The whole universe travels in cycles. If the economy goes to hell (deviates from the mean), sooner or later this bad cycle will end and the economy will rise (mean reversion).

Similarly, when the market moves extremely quickly in one direction (e.g. a sharp sell off or a spike in the market), contrarian investing states that the market will rebound to the other direction.

When to Buy and When to Sell
That being said, when everyone else is buying, contrarian investing says that you should sell. When everyone else is selling, contrarian investing says that you should buy.

However, the critical question here is: how do you define “everyone else is buying / selling?” How do you quantify the strenght of a market sell off or a market strength? After all, only when you quantify something can you make objective, unbiased investment decisions. Extremes are known as Oversold and Overbought. When the market is Oversold (very intense market selloff), it’s time to buy. When the market is Overbought (very intense spike), it’s time to sell. To quantify Oversold and Overbought, we have 3 techniques.

Oscillator Technical Indicators
Previously we have already discussed the definition of technical indicators. There is a specific type of technical indicators for contrarian investing called oscillators. Oscillators oscillate (waiver) around a mean line (average). When an oscillator reaches an extreme, a BUY/SELL signal is generated. When the Oscillator rises above a pre-determined number (e.g. 80), the market is considered to be Overbought. Thus, it’s time to sell. When the Oscillator falls below a pre-determined number (e.g. 20), the market is considered t obe Oversold. Thus, it’s time to buy. There are many types of Oscillators, but they all generate similar signals at similar times. Below is an example of an oscillator:

 

 An Introduction to Contrarian Investing
Credit
The above picture shows RSI (Relative Strenght Index) below the market price. Like all technical indicators, Oscillators such as RSI only use the market’s close price. In the above case, the predetermined “Overbought” level was 70 and the predetermined “Oversold” level was 30. What your predetermined level will be is up to your discretion.

Using Extreme Time
As the saying goes (which is a pretty big cliche), “history repeats itself”. Contrarian investors and traders use time as a measurement for “how extreme is the current sell off / spike in the market?” If the current sell off / spike extends beyond any historical precedent, then this is a really EXTREME situation, and the market should reverse to its mean (go the other way) any moment now. Here’s an example.

Let’s say that in the past 13 years, the U.S. stock market index S&amp;P500 has never fallen for 10 days in a row. That right there is a historical fact. If the market right now has fallen for 9 days in a row already, what are the odds that the market will spike? Considering that the market has never fallen more than 10 days, the odds of the market spiking is insanely high!.

Using Extreme Magnitude
Like using Extreme Time, using Extreme Magnitude also depends on history. If the current sell off / spike extends beyond historical precedent in terms of magnitude (what % has the market fallen/risen), then the odds of a market turn around are high. Here’s an example.

Let’s say that in history, no 1 month decline has gone beyond 10%. If the current 1 month decline has been 9%, what are the odds that the market will rally? Pretty high!",1

15-08-15,3h58eh,How much money do you make investing in bonds?,"Hello. I searched older posts and couldn't find the most simple explanation for someone who has zero background in investing. So please help explain to me how bonds work.  
If I invest $100,000 in a 12-month bond that pays a fixed 10% interest, how much does it pay out? I thought that this means I would be getting $9166 every month until the end of the bond. At the end, do I get paid out my $100,000 in addition? So in the end, I have $210,000?",0
15-08-15,3h5a04,"Can someone tell me if I'm on the right track here? (put and call options)","Just trying to understand the mechanics for put and call options here.

Let's say theoretically that I purchased put options on a gas company's stock (like Exxon or Chevron) last year around October when the price was high. My understanding is that now means I get to sell those options at an agreed upon price and date because I'm expecting for the price to fall (which they eventually did). 

Conversely let's say that today I think that oil prices have bottomed out (which I know they have most likely have not) and I now think that within a few years there might be some sort of Middle Eastern conflict that sky-rockets oil prices (btw, is it unrealistic to consider that as a mechanism for oil prices to go up?). So then I say, ok let me purchase a bunch of call options and wait to see if I'm right about a conflict on the horizon so I can then exercise my options and make a profit.

Now how does purchasing and holding on to these options work? Do I maybe pay a monthly premium to hold on to the options? Or maybe I pay a one-time discounted rate? Do I get charged capital gains tax for holding options? What's some good beginner info regarding these instruments? Is there anything in what I said about the put/call options that seems incorrect or flawed?

JUST A QUICK DISCLAIMER: My goal here is to educate myself around investing, so please don't assume that by me asking this question that this is a strategy I'm going to sink a ton of money into. Just using hypotheticals to understand investing concepts.",0

Up, down, in, out, here ya go:

Second up: Every amateurs favorite, the MACD Bounce (crossover)!  I had the cluster go through all symbols that either are having a bounce, or are failing the bounce.  This gives you some great plays if you think the bounce will hold, or even better plays if you think it'll fail.

Get in, get off, get out....here it is:

http://imgur.com/a/Hho1E

Last, but certainly not least, the best options plays based on TECHNICALS.  All these symbols have massive technicals going for them (ma, rsi, etc). You should be able to look at any of these charts and see why they were picked.

(can't think of a sexual one-liner...I'm tired)  Here it is:

None of you have the excuse of going naked and balls-deep into option plays now.  All this shit is juicy, and is positioned for high-reward with the lowest risk obtainable.

We were recently purchased by a large private equity firm that is offering a Management Equity Plan to some of us.  They are asking for a minimum investment of around $8,500 at the same per-unit price that they are claiming to make their investment - $5 per unit.  They will also provide each person who makes an equity investment with additional upside potential through an award of profits interest units.  The two components of the program go together so I must invest the minimum amount to receive anything at all.

In order to participate in this offer, I will be required to agree to a  non-solicitation and a non-compete.

They ""expect this allocation of profits interest units to be worth $239,217 assuming we achieve our Base Case financial projections, and including the proceeds from your investment in the common equity units, we would expect your total net proceeds to be worth $264,400.""

15-08-17,3hd4rf,[x-post] (US-CA) Selling mutual funds to minimize taxes,"Hi,

posting here since original at personalFinance did not get any responses: [original](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3h0gbt/usca_selling_mutual_funds_to_minimize_taxes/)
Maybe answer is so easy it didn't get picked up?


&amp;nbsp;


I have a long term loss in a mutual fund (several years) that I want to finally sell to invest the money somewhere else. I also have several mutual funds with capital gains which I intend to keep, but that could sell in order to offset the losses.


&amp;nbsp;


I believe you can offset capital gains with losses in your tax return, either with same kind of gain or any other income if there's a net loss.


&amp;nbsp;


**a)** Does that mean that it would be more beneficial to take a net loss as a deduction against ordinary income if the income tax bracket is higher than that of the long term capital gains, and hold on to the mutual funds with gains which I intended to keep?


&amp;nbsp;


**b)** If I sold mutual fund A at a loss, and mutual fund B at a gain to offset them, and then bought shares of mutual fund B soon after, would that also be considered a wash sale, or would it not since B was sold at a gain?


&amp;nbsp;


**c)** Any other considerations I should have such as class of shares?


&amp;nbsp;


I would appreciate advice or a link to a video, webpage or book about this subject.
Thanks! Sam.

15-08-17,3hasqa,"Are BDC's dying?","I have had about $10,000 (about 10% of my portfolio) in TCAP for about a year now. The dividend is nice (11%) so I've held on to it as the price has dipped. I'm down about 18% on the stock for the year but 11% sort of helps mitigate that so I'm down more like 7%. It usually ranges and you just reap the dividend, but it's plunged quite a bit in the past couple weeks. 

I'm smart enough to know that I'm not as smart as I'd like to think I am and I'm wondering if the imminent rate hike has anything to do with how BDC's (business development companies) make money. They loan money to small businesses and in turn make money on their investments, and I'm wondering if a higher interest rate cuts their profits or something. TCAP (and my old favorite I bailed out of at the right time, PSEC) have missed earnings and I get it, their stock will drop. But I'm just wondering if it might be time to cut loose my biggest loser and invest it somewhere else. I know they say cut your losses if you think you can put it somewhere else better, but I sort of like having a dividend stock. (Unless the bottom is going to fall out of course). 

I'm not really a dividends chaser (though I do own F and DRI) but a small portion of my portfolio with reliable income sounded nice. But I don't understand the sector as much as I'd like and hopefully someone here can provide a little more insight. ",6

15-08-18,3hdz7a,Starting a New Business in Canada,"Whether a business is established in another country or starting from the ground up in Canada, there are a few things that every business should do first. These steps will make sure that the business has the best chance of success and that the business is geared toward Canadian markets.
 
Research the Markets
The first thing that must be done before any new business enters the market is to do the research. The more information that is known about the industry sector, the economy and the demographics, the easier it is to tailor the business plan for the best chances of success. The Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses offers plenty of research into business trends, what is affecting new and small businesses and what sectors are growing. This not only helps with understanding the competition but finding which market in Canada is the best to enter at what time.  Small business optimism is on a slow decline in Canada at the moment but the majority of small businesses are expecting next year to be better than this year. This makes it a great time to start looking into Canada as a new opportunity for business.
 
Registering Your Business
When you decide to have your business Incorporate In Canada, there are a number of steps that must be taken to ensure that the business complies with all the laws and standards of Canada. This includes filing the correct permits at every level of government and filing the necessary paperwork to register your business. Business registration is necessary for tax purposes, payroll, GST/HST, and import/export but for many businesses, registration can be completed entirely online. It is important to go through the process in it’s entirely to make sure that everything is done correctly and that your business is eligible for online registration.
In terms of filing for permits and licenses there are a number of steps that must be taken. There are federal permits and licenses that need to be filed as well as permits and licenses for each province. If your business will have an office within Canada, it is important that it complies with the requirements of the province that the office will be located.
 
Hiring Canadian Employees
Even if you are expanding an ecommerce business that exists in another country, you may want to have a local office within Canada. The process and requirements for hiring employees in Canada is process that every business must be familiar with if they want to comply with the laws and regulations of the country. Payroll deductions are a necessary part of having employees in Canada and must be conducted in partnership with the Canada Revenue Agency. For new businesses that are unfamiliar with this process, it can be very beneficial to hire an experienced Canadian business advisor to jump start the process. This will be costly initially, but it will ensure that all the legalities are covered and that all new employees are in compliance with the country’s regulations.",1

Main points from the article:

1. Good job
2. Learning the rules
3. Appreciation (assets vs liabilities)
4. Education
5. Capitalism
6. Entrepreneurial mindset

15-08-18,3hg95c,Recently Switched Jobs - 401K Options,"Hello,

I recently switched jobs and wanted to get the opinion of others on what I should do with my 401K funds from a former employer.  In the past I have typically just put all my investments into a target 2045 fund with my former employers, but recently I wanted to increase the risk of my portfolio for potential stronger gains.


*Background Info:*

I currently have two 401K's still sitting with former employers.  The one I am currently uncertain about has a little over $30K in it, which I will call Account 1 while the other 401K has ~$85K in it, which i'll refer to is Account 2.  My dilemma is that the 401K with the 30K (Account 1) does not have great investment options in my opinion.  

Just as an example, Account 1 has JPMCB SmartRetirement target 2045 funds with an ER of .88%, whereas Account 2, has Vanguard target funds 2045 with an ER of .06%, which is one of the main reasons why I never rolled any of it over to Account 1.


*Account 1 Details:*
Currently, I have about $21K in a SSgA S&amp;P 500 Index Fund with an ER of .01% and $9K in Fidelity Growth Company (FDGRX) with an ER of .82%, and a couple hundred dollars left in the 2045 target fund due to the price difference between when I sold all of the shares.

Vanguard Money Market | Money Market| 0.10%

Three weeks into August and transportation services company On The Move Systems (Pink: OMVS) is leading the pink pack in paid promotions. Although shares had jumped to as high as $4.30 around 4 August, today they are trading at $2.04, but that’s a positive in that price has been up and down for the majority of August and today’s action reflects at gain of over 12 percent.

The company has shelled out $115,000 so far this month to paid promoters with the majority of the cheddar going to Stockpalooza.com, a hefty $100k. StocksToBuyNow is the only other paid promoter and it has garnered $15k for its efforts so far this month. So what are the promoters saying?

Stockpalooza.com doesn’t make any wild claims about the company, instead promoting on the merits of OMVS. “Management places strong emphasis on customer satisfaction and approaches this viewpoint by creating a unique flight or service profile for each client. The company has developed a business model offering this profile access through various proprietary and membership models. Additionally, its business strategy incorporates acquiring or joining with smaller charter plane owners. The company has further established various divisions which address particular client needs and routes. Leveraging its unique business model with a host of innovative solutions for expanding markets, OMVS is well positioned for rapid growth.” StocksToBuyNow takes the same approach while highlighting CEO Robert Wilson’s “vast experience” in evaluating and taking leadership positions in many small and micro-cap companies.

Neither promoter says that you’ll make a mint by investing in the company. Instead they both focus on the merits of OMVS. Pretty tame stuff when compared to the tactics of some other promoters and refreshing.

About OMVS

As with any micro-cap, the company is a bit volatile. Due diligence is a must before jumping in.",1

15-08-18,3hgs1o,[Bloomberg Business] Buzzkill Profs: Hedge Funds Do Half as Well as You Think,"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-17/buzzkill-profs-hedge-funds-do-half-as-well-as-you-think  

This is going to be easy to attack, but I find it interesting nonetheless. Academics have attempted to remove the ""inherent biases in the way hedge-fund databases compile results"" and calculated that:

&gt;The average annualized return for the industry since 1996 goes from 12.6 percent to 6.3 percent when the biases are removed from the data

... 

&gt;The biases stem from the fact that hedge funds voluntarily report results to these databases.  The main reason they cough up the data is for marketing purposes, according to the paper, and funds generally begin contributing their returns once they have results worth bragging about. And since the funds include prior returns when they first enter the database, it leads to a “backfill bias” or “instant history bias” that boosts the average returns. 

I'm sure the way they have accounted for these bias is highly subjective, but the understanding the biases inherent in self-reported data is instructive.",5

Possibly a naive question here but something that my brother and I were kicking around...

Is it possible to create a private company (private LLC?) between the two of us, my brother and I, to jointly invest in stocks and ETFs?  Here is how it would work: he and I would each deposit proportional money into an account (say I deposit $3,000 and he deposits $2,000, so I ""own"" 3/5 of the company and he owns 2/5) and then jointly he and I develop investment plans and then invest the money in securities for duration he and I both see fit.  We would NOT solicit money from other people, this is just for he and I to have fun with and do something exciting together.  We would use a brokerage to make the investments (obviously) and not try and directly buy and sell securities by circumventing a brokerage firm (like E*Trade for example.)

Seems simple enough, I just thought I'd get your advice.  Aside that it is probably a great way to lose both our money, is there something I am missing as to why this is not possible to do?  We are not investing professionals nor do we have our Series 7 or anything like that but if this is all private between us, not involving anybody else (i.e. investing to people and/or promising a return for others) then would that even matter?

1. How do high net worth individuals store/access their money? Example I'm an actor that just got 8 million for a movie, what do I do? Hand it over to my planner? What do these people generally do with large commissions like that?

2. When a founder goes public and becomes a millionaire/billionaire due to an IPO, how are they accessing money? If I'm John Smith and I found Acme, go public, IPO does well and my company is worth say $20B[illion], and I have 50% of the stock so I'm worth $10B, I'm a billionaire but I can only use any of the money by selling the stock, correct? Aren't I a billionaire with potentially no money in my daily/regular access accounts? (Obviously I wouldn't have gotten there without being fiscally sound and having a lot saved, I'm just trying to make the point).

3. If everyone was invested in ETFs, wouldn't there be no stock market movement as no one is buying/selling stocks or mutual funds? I'm confused about this, just theoretically taking the idea to the extreme as I keep reading that nothing else is good but ETFs.

When your discussing investing decisions with an FA, especially single stock once, what should I be asking him to confirm that he's really done his research on this company?

Ask if the companys are included in any of our index funds already to avoid redundancy? Ask him the time frame?

We already have discussed the goals I have, and so far since putting my money in just about 5 weeks ago it's 1.25% fee has been taken twice (the first fee was smaller for some reason) and the actual value of the account is right where it was after the fees.


Obviously, this is a slow thing. But what do I ask my FA so that I'm not just at his mercy? He's said that we wont be making any trades on my account unless we discuss them first, unlike my IRA which he just trades without abandon. Is that good? I guess? What should I tell him?

----------------------
Original:

So, I own(ed) a bit of GrafTech (GTI), which just acquired (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/brookfield-completes-acquisition-of-graftech-2015-08-17-81735017 and http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/marketwire/1212557.htm)

I realized this after checking my portfolio on etrade and seeing GTI listed at $0.00, 100% loss, and when clicking the symbol it tells me it's invalid.  Does this mean I've actually lost the money entirely? In the articles above, I read ""In the merger, each of the remaining shares of the Company's common stock will be converted into the right to receive $5.05 per share, in cash, without interest and less any required withholding taxes, which is the same amount per share that was paid in the tender offer, and all convertible preferred stock owned by the Purchaser or Acquisition Sub will be canceled and shall cease to exist.""  but how would I exercise this ""right to receive $5.05 per share""?  I haven't received any notifications regarding this, and as far as etrade is concerned it's now worthless stock in a nonexistent company.  ",32

15-08-19,3hjvij,I know this subreddit is all about the short term hype train but hear me out.,"Let me try break down why i think tesla is a good stock to buy for the long run. Toyota and honda both have a market cap of over 100 billion dollars and tesla has a market cap of 33 billion . So the reason why honda and toyota have high market caps is because they are affordable and they always have amazing sales numbers. On the other hand luxury brands or slightly more expensive  like mercedes audi GM bmw they all have one thing in common which is that their market cap always always always floats around 50 billion. So right now tesla is still in its infancy, it could be the next toyota or honda by introducing affordable car models and being more accessible OR it can stay a luxury brand like GM bmw mercedes ford Chevy  bmw ect ect... You may use the argument well if other car companies use teslas patents to create their own electric vehicles wouldn't they be a better investment but even though teslas patents are free to everyone it's not like mercedes will suddenly make a affordable luxury car to expand their market and it's not like toyota can somehow make their sales go any higher. Basically what I'm trying to say is tesla has the most potential to grow if they can hit the affordability market with the model 3. I actually have no idea what I'm talking about but please give me money.",2

15-08-18,3hhtrp,Newbie looking for investing advice.,"Hi.  I created a new reddit account for this question for my financials aren't tied to my other account on reddit.


Little background - I live in Ontario Canada.  I rent and am not looking to buy a house.  I don't have kids and want to retire (not need works money) as early as possible.  My living costs are low, around 1200-1400$/mo all in.  I typically put 2400$/mo into savings.

I have a net worth of approximately 200K.


10k as a buffer in my chequing account.

80k in an Tangerine savings account (1.35%)

20k in a Tangering TFSA MF - balanced growth

45k in my company's stock

50k in my company's group RRSP


For retirement I have only been working after university for about 6 years so CPP and my works retirement benefits won't add up to much assuming I want to not need this job well before 65.


My recent actions have been to actually start making use of my TFSA.  I put in that 20k recently from the Tangerine savings account.  I have another 21k tfsa contribution room but I thought I should maybe spread out the contribution to cost average it in case I opened the account in a high period.  I'd like your advise on how fast to contribute to this kind of account.  And better placement and re-balancing of my assets after I run out of TFSA contribution room.  My RRSP contribution room is already pretty maxed year to year.


I understand that there is a fee/MER with the managed fund, and this is significant having this much to invest.  (still expecting better returns than just the savings account) Would you switch to buying and selling individual stocks with questrade or something at this point?  where would I find a guide for the manual re-balancing?


I know leaving the 45K in my work stock / single stock is risky, so the bulk of that I'd expect should be moved, and most of it is cashable now.  And my Tangerine savings is doing very little at 1.35%.


Thank you for your help.

15-08-18,3hhxhi,"I'm drunk and I want to help you guys out cause I love this subreddit","So, I'm sitting here sipping on some beers and I've decided that to get better at trading, I'm going to post here more often.  My decisions are out in the open for you guys to critique me and maybe learn from me.

This is going to be a long post so grab a beer.  

Alright basically I'm going to start posting my analysis' and charts so you guys can see how I make my trading decisions.  I see too many of you just piggy backing on others instead of learning how to make your own decisions.  When you do your own due diligence, you have so much more confidence in being able to stay in the trade and successfully exit it also.  

Ok so let's begin.  I would categorize myself as a swing trader.  This means most of my positions are held from either 2-7 days for a short term swing trade or from 2 weeks to 3 months and at most 6 months for a longer term play.  I focus mainly on futures but for my posts I will try to focus more on equities because that's what most people on this sub are doing.  If I do show analysis for a futures contract it will be the ES which is the S&amp;P 500 emini contract only because I prefer it to SPY.  For the sake of my posts, ES and SPY pretty much move the same way.

Now, what equities do I trade?  Not fucking penny stocks, I’ll tell you that.  I am here to make money, not feed my ego.  I'm not looking for the next best thing that's going to give me a 1000% gain overnight.  I'm looking for consistent and reliable profits from great companies.  If you're feeling like putting on more risk, then do it by trading options, not by putting your money into some shit company.

Here’s an example.  Note that everything is obviously clearer in hindsight.  I did however take the trade I’m about to show you.

Step 1.  Find a great company.  I’ll start by just looking at a long term chart (at least 1 year, preferably 3-10) of a company that’s pretty well known and one that I believe has a business edge over their competitors.  From the chart I’m looking for a couple of things.  If we’re in a bull market like we are now, then this stock better be fucking going up.  There is no exception to this.  If you can’t go up when pretty much everything else is, then I am not giving you my money.  This doesn’t mean that some companies don’t break out of this rut and do make it big.  It means that it’s unlikely and that’s just not good enough for me because I work hard for my money and I’m not going to just throw it away.  So let’s look at Netflix (NFLX).  Honestly, i’ll look at their financial statements on google finance for 3 minutes to basically determine are these fuckers going to go bankrupt or some stupid shit like that?  If the answer is no then we’re good to go.  That is the extent of my financial statement/accounting numbers analysis.  I don’t care about P/E ratios, EPS, revenue, short interest whatever.  What I really want to know is if this company can destroy all of its competitors and rake in the dough.  Ok so back to Netflix.  At least once a day on reddit you’ll see the term “netflix and chill”.  This is coming from the age group that is the most difficult to predict and market to because teenagers are fuckin nuts.  So when teenagers rave about a company, that’s a good sign.  Now to get more technical.  Netflix costs $7 a month and has no ads.  Hulu plus costs $8 a month and has so many freaking ads.  They also do not have nearly as many tv shows and I believe no movies.  They also don’t produce their own original content which Netflix has been killing it at.  Hulu’s only plus is that they tend to have new episodes sooner while Netflix has to wait till the season is finished or whatever to negotiate a deal.  So Netflix&gt;Hulu.  Now what about regular tv which is probably Netflix’s main competitor.  Netflix will probably never surpass the number of customers that cable tv gets, but that’s not the point.  The point is that Netflix’s membership numbers are going up, while cable tv has been going down.  And it’s not just that.  Go on google for 5 minutes and I don’t think you will ever see anyone on the internet write about how they love cable tv’s customer service, yet I don’t hear a lot of bitching about netflix.  Then don’t even get me started on the price differences.  But you’re probably saying well my tv has 900 channels and netflix doesn’t.  No one fucking watches 900 channels.  I’d say at most you watch 10-15 different channels in a given week.  You also have to watch a commercial every 8 fucking minutes, which i’m pretty sure absolutely no one is a fan of.  The only real draw back of not having tv is not being able to watch sports live, but many companies are coming up with online streaming so this problem will soon be gone.  Ok hopefully that’s enough to show you that Netflix’s business model is much stronger than it’s competitors.  I should also note that this is just the beginning of Netflix.  We have no idea what they’re going to branch into next.  TV has been around forever and it basically hasn’t changed at all.  Ok that’s enough for step 1.  Basically just find a company that gets shit done and one that people love and people love to talk about.  Don’t just find one company.  Find around 10 that you love.

If you are having trouble coming up with companies to look at for this step, take a look at all the companies on the S&amp;P 500 and also look at companies that you actually do business with.  I have a membership for netflix and so does pretty much everyone else I know.  To me it was a no brainer.  Another example is that I buy pretty much anything that can be bought from amazon on amazon, so again another no brainer.

Step 2.  Wait for the right entry.  Just because you found the greatest company in the world doesn’t mean that it’s currently at the best price in the world for you to buy it at.  You want to buy low and sell high.  You hear all this crap about not being able to time the market and it’s absolute horse shit.  You seriously think the guys making money trading just place a market order whenever and say well i’m in it for the long term so it doesn’t matter.  Trust me, it fucking matters.  Here are a few reasons why.  1.  The longer your money is in the market, the longer you don’t have money to be able to put money into something else.  It’s classic opportunity cost.  For example, if you put all your money into SPY in 2007 with the logic that, oh I’m in it for the long term so my entry point doesn’t matter because fuckity fuck fuck it’s going to go up eventually.  Yeah you’re right, you’ll be in the green if your time frame is over the next 30 years.  But from 2007 to about mid 2013, your money was doing absolutely nothing for you.  Not even doing nothing, you had to watch it go down down down down.  This is psychologically painful as fuck.  Having to sit on the sidelines for 6 years because you’re a dumb piece of shit for listening to r/investing is not fun at all.  What sucks even more is all the potential money you could have made by putting your money somewhere else.  Plus you lost out on a fuck ton of gains by buying at the peak instead of the bottom.  Basically you’re in a lose lose lose situation unless you’re looking to retire when you’re 115 aka dead.  

You have to realize that everything goes up and down.  Good companies go down.  Shitty companies go up.  You have to wait for these opportunities and grab em by the throat when they finally do happen.

So how do you know when you’re getting in at a good price?  Use overbought and oversold indicators.  These are probably the most common indicators in the world and they work really well on longer time frames.  I would not use them to day trade because they can stay overbought or oversold for relatively long periods of time.  

So back to Netflix.  http://imgur.com/YVJMhO9 This is a 10 year monthly chart of Netflix with a stochastic indicator in the second panel, money flow index in the third, and universal oscillator in the fourth.  Note that It doesn’t show data to 2015 because I’m acting like this is happening in real time.  So this first picture will have the data after my entry point blocked out because it’s really freaking easy to pick out entry points in hindsight.  You will not have that luxury in real life.  You need to be able to make these decisions as they happen, not after they’ve happened.  

So let me explain the indicators real quick.  In the most simplest terms, these 3 show overbought/oversold.  Stochastic is really really well known and you can look up exactly how it works by using our friend google.  Money flow index shows how much money is moving in and out of the equity.  I honestly don’t know what the fuck the universal one does, but I do know it shows overbought/oversold signals.  So how do I use these indicators?  If i’m looking at a great company to go long in (buy) then I am looking for points where the company is oversold.  If it’s a great company then it won’t stay oversold for long so I know that that point is a great time to get in.  I use all 3 of the indicators to find the best point of entry.  Stochastics is a lagging indicator so I use that one more for confirmation.  Money flow index is my baby.  This is my go to for looking for major imbalances in price.  The universal oscillator is better on shorter time frames so I don’t use it for a lot of entries for equities because I tend to hold equities longer than futures contracts, but again it does help a lot and makes me more confident in my decisions.  So go back to the picture and look at the green vertical line that shows the low point of the money flow index confirmed by universal oscillators low that happened previously.  Stochastic’s hasn’t completely bottomed out yet but it’s pretty damn close which is a good sign momentum will be swinging the other way soon. 

So now you have enough fundamental and technical analysis to go in.  You can enter a position by using options or just straight buying equities depending on your risk tolerance.  I would start with just buying the stock outright because there’s a lot more information you need to know to trade options like decay, the greeks, picking the right date, picking the right strike price and stuff like that.  I am not an expert at options so when I want to go hard I tend to trade futures instead.  My point is just make sure you’re comfortable with what you’re doing.  Ok so back to the entry.  There are two things you need to come up with.  The right entry limit price, but more importantly the right stop loss price.  The right entry limit price won’t be hard to determine because you’re already going in when the equity is over sold.  Just try to get in on a down day and you’ll be getting in at a good price.  What’s way more important though is the price at which you say fuck it I’m wrong and I’m not going to lose any more money on this trade aka your stop loss price.  This is more of an art than a science.  I don’t want to get too technical with my first post but you want your stop to be below a major support but not at the major support.  Don’t put it one cent below the support, you need to give it some room.  Trust me, you don’t want to get stopped out when you were right about all your analysis and price eventually went up but just had too tight of a stop so you made nothing.  This is a way shittier feeling than getting stopped out because you were wrong about your analysis.  

So let’s say you entered at $7 which is perfectly reasonable if you followed the previous steps.  You want to then put your stop at around $5 because the market showed a lot of support around $6.  This doesn’t mean you always put your stop 2 dollars lower than your entry price.  Please don’t fucking do this.  Another stupid thing to do would be to say, “ok I only want to risk 5% of my account on this trade so I’ll put a stop where If i’m wrong I’ll lose 5%.  Yes you should definitely be using risk management in your trades but risk management shouldn’t determine your stop.  You should determine the stop first, and then use your risk management to determine how many shares you can buy.  

Now this second picture (http://imgur.com/ce0mnIi)  will show you the rest of the story after the entry signal which was the green line.  As you can clearly see, SHIT WENT UP YO.  So now we come to step 3.


Step 3.  Exiting your position.  
I use the same indicators that I used for my entry to help me determine my exit.  Now instead of looking for when your stock is oversold, you want to look for when it’s overbought.  So again, I want my money index flow to be maxing out, my universal oscillator to confirm it, and then my lagging stochastics to be on the way up but not maxed out.  Wait for a day when everything is green and gtfo with your money.  Don’t use fucking hope to determine your exit point.  Don’t use fucking msnbcs bull shit to determine your exit.  Don’t listen to your grandma or even WSB.  Just listen to the indicators and you’ll get out at a great price.  I’m not saying you’ll always get out at the very very top but you’ll get out with getting at least 80% of the move which is pretty damn freaking good.  My exit would have been the red line which is where money flow index was maxed out.

Note: As you can see Netflix went up significantly more within the next year and a half.  However, I would not have held it for that long simply because my trading time frames are not that long.  I would have waited for the next oversold period to enter again, but I wouldn’t sit there and wait it out.  This might just be personal preference.  

Step 4.  Buy yacht/beer/weed/house/car, pay off student loans, buy your girlfriend a gift, or don’t spend any money and just wait for the next opportunity.  I tend to pick the best of both worlds.  I’ll go out and have fun for the weekend, but not blow it all.  It’s ok to celebrate a win, but it’s pretty damn fucking stupid to waste it all.  You want your money to grow and spending money is basically the biggest fuck you that you can do to your money.  

Ok so I know this post was long as fuck but hopefully some of you read the whole thing.  This is pretty much my most basic analysis I use for going long in equities.

Some frequently asked questions that you’ll probably have:
1.  What program am I using for charting/indicators?
Think or swim.  Put 1 dollar in a TD Ameritrade account and you can use this program.  I think it’s the best basically free software out there for charting.  I wouldn’t use it to day trade ever but for swing trading/ long term trading it gets the job done.

2.  Why should I listen to you?
I’m not saying I am the greatest trader of all time and everything I say is the word of god.  I’m not saying that if I enter a trade you should automatically do so also.  I’m trying to get you guys to trade DIFFERENTLY.  Most of what you guys are doing just isn’t working at all.  So stop fucking doing the same shit over and over!!!!  The problem isn’t the market, the problem is YOU.  My strategy is basic af, but it works.  There is a huge difference between a winner and loser and don’t you ever fucking forget it.  Become a winning trader by learning to think and execute like a winning trader.  This post will hopefully be a step in the right direction for everyone.  

3.  Are you rich?
No, I lost my grub stake learning how to day trade futures (about 15k).  I was forcing myself to be something that I’m not.  Guys, this is about making money and absolutely nothing else.  Find what makes you money and milk that shit as much as you can.  Don’t go off and do something because that’s what the pros do or that’s what the rest of this subreddit is doing.  In the end nothing matters except if you are consistently profitable.  

4.  Why did I make this post/future posts?
I kind of answered this in the beginning but I”ll go more in depth.  This is probably the first time I actually physically wrote out step by step what I do, so that right there benefited me a lot.  Secondly, it honestly breaks my heart looking through some of these posts and seeing what you guys do.  I fucking love this subreddit and I want you all to actually eventually get your yachts or what not.  The people here have the balls to actually risk their money and I think they deserve to get a return just for that because let’s face it most people are complete utter fucking pussies.  I have respect for people that dream bigger than being mediocre so maybe this will inspire some of you guys to really learn about how to become profitable instead of just being another guy that swears that the market is rigged and that no one can make money.

Good luck guys.  Feel free to ask me questions about anything.  I’ll do my best to answer them.  ",398

15-08-18,3hi1kk,$AVXL -- a warning.,"TL;DR: I believe AVXL my be setting up for a pump and dump -- this does NOT remove the underlying fundamentals!

As I am so deeply invested in AVXL I am closely monitoring all available social media sources.   I was wondering why AVXL was moving up monday and tuesday in the absence of news (Save for a paywall SA article and a small wanna be news blog post).  This afternoon I noticed that the usually pronounced short-spikes followed by the usual short SELL flurries on yahoo were missing.

In short (heh), the messages screaming SELL SELL SELL! Are absent and the messages screaming BUY BUY BUY are all over YMB.

While the underlying fundamentals of the company have NOT changed, I do believe that in the slack time before the next catalyst this stock is being prepped as a pump and dump.  I could be wrong, and if I am, I hope this doesn't hurt anyone reading this post.   But if I had available funds I would hold off a few days.   

AVXL is a STRONG buy for me and if you're holding I'd suggest holding through rather than risk that I'm right or wrong here, but if you were planning to add, next week may be a better choice.  

If there is a dump the stock will rebound on the conference announcement and you get cheap shares.  If I'm wrong, I apologize in advance.

15-08-18,3hi58n,Question on Traditional Investing vs. IRA vs. Whole Life Insurance,"Hello Everyone - here is my situation. My wife &amp; I have been very poor for a long time. About 5 years ago, we started a small company, and we've been making really decent money. We have a pretty big dealer contract base, and it seems like we'll continue to do well.

My question - for the last 2 years, our Financial Advisor has helped us with Term Life insurance (250k for each of us), and IRA's for the purpose of tax relief for our company.
Lately, he has been really pushing us to do a Whole Life Insurance policy for the sake of Investing in our later years.

Here's the issue - I still have a ""poor"" mentality. I like having money in the bank (I know this is not a good idea from an investment standpoint), but I never know if/when I might need it. My wife &amp; I are very frugal, but I also don't want to work forever.

My financial situation: I'm 37, my wife is 48. The only loan we have is our house (140k), and we've been putting 5k a month on the house payment, hoping to pay it off in 2.5 years. We have 150k in the bank, and 40k in IRA's.

My question to you - I would like to invest 50k. Should I stick with a traditional investment, or go with the Whole Life? He really seems to ""upsell"" the Whole Life as some type of ""loop-whole"" idea. Or, should I stick to a more tangible investment like a rental property? I'm not looking to get rich, but I would like a better interest rate than the bank for my money.

I'm 17 years old and with nice capital I'm in a good position  to get started at an early age with money that other teenagers wouldn't have. I pretty much have a golden oppurtunity and I don't want to waste it.

Anyway, I've been squatting on this money for months as I debate what to do with it. I looked into guaranteed government investments however I would have to put the money away for about 4.5 years to get any 'decent' return and even then it's only about 4%, nothing in comparison to what can be achieved through other investments. The biggest trouble I've had is thinking about investing in various stocks because I see long term potential (AMZN, GOOGL), just to watch them grow before I've invested.

My question is, should I just bite the bullet now and go for it because of the rule that 'time in the market is more important than timing in the market'? I suppose we would never invest if we keep looking at what we could have made.

Or maybe I'm going in blind and I should educate myself more on investing before going anywhere with this money? What do you think my best course of action is?

15-08-19,3hiqqc,"Questions about Inheritance, Investing, and Graduate School Loans","*Please feel free to skip to the TL;DR: at the end.*

**Background Info**

Using my throwaway account because I don't want my roommates (whom I met on Reddit) and other random friends to know my personal finances.

So I'm a little late in asking this, as I received my inheritance almost two years ago now. A couple months before my final semester in undergrad I received around $250,000.

At the time I had no loans since I had managed to cover school through scholarships and frugality, had never purchased a car, and had no credit or bills whatsoever, besides rent and utilities.

After keeping some money aside for a car, traveling, and a year off between undergrad and graduate school, I invested $230,000 through a family friend (my older brother's childhood friend) who works at MetLife Investments.

Even though I find investing very interesting, and used to have a stock simulator in undergrad - I decided it would be unwise to pay too much attention and ""play"" with the money - so I have let my financial adviser make all of the decisions and handle it completely.

The money came in chunks, and I deposited it between October 2013 and March 2014.  My adviser has completely diversified it, has purchased me a term (that's turning into whole) life insurance policy, and I suppose all the other things you would generally expect.

I am starting graduate school at the end of the month (in DC, so also a very high cost of living), and he advised me not to touch the money in my investments, but pay through a combinations of my leftover savings, working through school, and unsubsidized loans.

With a part time job and all predicted costs, I should be able to manage with taking out $41,000 over two years, or $10,250 per semester.  For the first year, the unsubsidized graduate loan interest rate is 5.84%.  I will have to start paying them back six months after graduation, at which point hopefully I have a good job lined up.  I must also pay any interest accrued at the time to prevent it from being capitalized when repayment begins.

Going by the total $230,000 being invested by March 2014, my current portfolio is at $232,500, or an increase of $2,500 over about a year and a half.

**The Actual Questions**

Is this an amount I should be expecting, considering what I pay to MetLife Investments and MetLife life insurance, and normal fees for starting up a diversified investment portfolio, for someone at the age of 23?

Will it begin to perform better now that things are settling in, or should I get on my advisor about being more aggressive with the investments?  He's a family friend so I completely trust that he has my best interests in mind, especially considering he came into his inheritance through a very similar situation.  He's also young, so I just want to get other's opinions.

The other question being regarding the loans.  Does this seem like a smart plan?  With my current growth rate, I worry I'll be losing more to loan interest than my investments will be growing.  However, it also will keep me from spending unwisely, since I'll have loan payments to focus on first.

**TL;DR:** Invested $230,000 a year and a half ago through MetLife, it has only grown $2,500, is that normal? Advisor recommends taking out loans for graduate school instead of paying for it upfront, is this wise?",1

15-08-18,3hfvqs,Investing in a millennial economy: what spending habits will drive the new economy?,"Millenials are expected to out spend baby boomer by [2017]( http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20131024006116/en/Millennials-Outspend-Baby-Boomer-Catching-Retail-Industry#.VdMjSr3D_qA).

From and investing standpoint, who's going to benefit as a result of this shift in spending. Here's what I know:

1) Millennials were trying to start careers in one of the worst economies ina generation. Many started out with either low paying jobs or several jobs just to make ends meat. As a result, a shared economy has begun to bloom. My generation isn't buying movies or CDs, were subscribing to services like Netflix or Spotify. More are moving to cities, driving less and relying on services like Uber or Lyft. Hell, even going on vacation my friends are more likely to use airbnb over getting a hotel. 

The rise of a sharing economy is the result of millenials becoming adults without the money to spend. I firmly believe companies that are gearing toward a shared economy will benefit in the next 5-10 years.


2) Once established in their careers, most millenials will want to settle down. But less and less are buying homes. In fact, more millenials are willing to [spend money on a car, and rent their home]( http://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2015/01/20/10-new-findings-about-the-millennial-consumer/) and millenials are willing to [spend 50% more on car tech than baby boomers]( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-22/millennials-willing-to-outspend-boomers-by-50-on-car-tech)

Companies like Ford see a shift in business model, from a piece in the Wall Street Journal, Bill Ford said “forward-looking companies will redefine themselves and move from just being car and truck manufacturers to become personal-mobility companies.” They're investing in a total ecosystem of interconnectivity.

I'm also planning to look into firms that supply cities with public transportation. Bus manufacturing for example, or a company like Wabtech for expanded rail use.

3) Millenials want to spend their money on [brands that are socially responsible]( http://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2015/01/20/10-new-findings-about-the-millennial-consumer/). From the same article it mentions they're immune to advertising. They cling to brands that do good. Two firms come to mind: 1) SBUX, has given employees countless benefits from stock options to college education. They also seem to be a great indicator of gentrification (the neighborhoods most millenials are moving into). 2) Costco - breaking your teeth in a shitty economy means you want your money to stretch and if I'm going to belong to a discount box chain, I'm not going to sams club. 

4) This ~~segways~~ segues (props to MBGLK) into another area of millenials spending habits. They want to shop around for the best price and are more likely to utilize online retailers. Amazon is an obvious benefactor but I'm also paying close attention to Wayfair. If millenials are saving money by not buying a home, I expect them to indulge in making their apartments nice. 

Where do you see millenials spending money? What publicly traded firms do you think will benefit the most from the millenials economy?

15-08-18,3hfzdc,Private mortgage lending as an investment - Is this ever a good idea?,"I have a co-worker who is planning on investing a significant amount of money into private mortgage lending through a brokerage who matches lenders with borrowers needing high interest, short term, first or second mortgages. The brokerage promises high rates of return (up to 12%!) for what they claim is a low-risk investment as the loan is secured against 'high quality' real estate equity. They claim that have the ability to find better-than-average borrowers as mortgage underwriters, taking advantage of the fact that tightened mortgage-lending requirements have squeezed some people who would have qualified for a traditional mortgage onto secondary lending markets.

As background, I should point out that I am in Canada where home prices have continued to rise throughout the U.S. housing market crash. Respectable economists argue that we'll more likely see a flattening of home prices than a decline, although this is hotly debated. So an investment secured by real estate doesn't seem as risky to the average Canadian as it would to someone in the U.S.

To me the downside risk of borrowers failing to pay clearly outweighs the returns even if they are 12%, but people differ in their risk tolerance. As well, brokers are motivated to match as many mortgages as possible to collect their fees, so unless lenders can trust the mortgage underwriting they may be taking on even more than anticipated risk. 

Despite these concerns, private lending arrangements are growing and more people are investing in them. I am trying to find specific information about the risks and returns of this type of investment but there is surprisingly little out there. 

So, does anyone have any personal experience with these investments? Do you know of any good sources of information detailing more about private lending from an investment standpoint? If you find the 'right' brokerage firm, could this be a way to earn higher-than-average returns?

This article is about the best summary of this lending market I could find, but it only touches on the issue of lender risk:

For those who dont know Mr.Kiyosaki, he is the author of the famous personal finance book, Rich Dad, Poor Dad. In this book he tells about his childhood, and how he could have the fortunate guidance from two fathers. His real dad who made poor financial decisions, and his friend's dad who made sound decisions which later on made him financially independent.

Hi guys, story aside, that is what am looking for. We live in a world filled with information explosion. Every minute we are bombarded with breaking news, news as it happens, analyses, tweets and what not. While this is supposed to make us more intelligent, I find myself at the opposite end. I am baffled.

As in the book Rich Dad Poor Dad (which I have seen many people suggesting as a good personal finance book to read), I need some sources. Like in the old 60s, without the tv, internet and social media, this rich dad could decipher solid information from his available sources. Be that a ticker tape or newspapers, he made sound judgements and made himself more and more literate everyday in financial matters. What can I do to attain the same today?

I see hundreds of sure-shot authors, articles, blogs, channels claiming to be instilling you with the best information, pure gold in their terms. I devotionally watch CNBC, Bloomberg, CNN and other sources. I go through major financial magazines, blogs, project reports. While I do capture a nugget here and there, I believe most of what I am hearing is white noise. And the real gold is hidden under it. I am at a loss to see it, in the blistering brilliance of the noise.

Can you guys suggest something simple, solid and to the point which will help me realise what is happening with the world on a day to day basis? I am not trying to be a know-it-all of every sector out there. I want to identify the method, to sift the pure matter from all the riffraff. I want to study this fantastic field, without wasting my time watching reality tv. How do you guys do it? Is it still possible with all the information superhighways? Should I just give up? My heart tells me I should not. Because I believe with a solid study method, diligent analysis, dedication and some time, anyone with reasonable intelligence can sift through the material like a real professional. I would like to hear from you guys about how to do it. Please guide me. Thank you.

15-08-19,3hjie9,"Since the epic BGMD DD.. I present my DD Mailbag: $MCZ , $ATVI , $DIS. An inside look at Video Game distribution supply chains.","Let me begin this DD by saying: I hold no position in $MCZ, $DIS, $ATVI. I am also not employed by them, or their related parties. The information about to be presented to you was obtained through idk and yolo ways and is likely, idk 100% legal.


So without saying much, I was analyzing the supply chain at **the biggest** distributor of video games, video game marketing, signage, and toy distributor in North and Latin America.

I was given a tour of the ""Upcoming toys, games, &amp; trends"" executive room, and also the warehouse.

So lets begin our tour at **$MCZ** Mad Catz Inc.

Someone on WSB is hyperbullish on $MCZ and believes the company's upcoming Rock Band 4 is going to be a hit. When I visited the exec lounge, I had the opportunity to view the unreleased prototype packaging, marketing, and space allocated to the Madcatz game. I sneaked in some pictures. They used FedEx to ship this prototype.

Later on in the tour, I had the opportunity to roam the warehouse and speak with the supply chain team leads of the company. There I asked about Rock Band and grilled them.

** For the previous releases of Rock Band, this company rented an entire warehouse, on top of its huge warehouse in my city, just to accommodate the insane demand. However, demand had fallen off after the last one and the staff seemed quite unsure of what it would be like and whether there would even be re-orders.**

A lot of the employees I spoke with; with the exception of management had no idea Mad Catz was at the helm of the new Rock Band.

Here are some pictures to prove I'm not full of shit. 

**http://imgur.com/nMAaXGB,VKn0C8i,NvmTjbq,XEDbZrp,fKYr4K9#0**

I can answer any other questions on $MCZ. I would now like to move on to the Bae of WSB.

**$DIS Ifinity toys are going to go fucking ham, fam.**

Alright you fuckers, now I know WSB is already more overweight than an average American when it comes to our love for $DIS, so this might make you jizz on your hamburgers and hotdogs.

To keep it short, the entirety of the 24 warehouse staff in pre-release and time-sensitive zones were all stacking Ifinity toys ready to be launched across stores on 08/30/15. This was on all the packages, with green stickers. To the roof. [This warehouse](http://i.imgur.com/WjuP8Xv.jpg) was literally overflowing with Ifinity toys. A lot of Yoda, Minnie, etc.

I can answer more questions regarding Disney. The workers were pretty hyped for the launch.

**$ATVI Because you are all neckbeards and still play WoW**

The only game that the employees were more hyped about than Call of Duty, was Skylanders. When I spoke with the management, they said the warehouse is jammed on CoD releases, but similar waves are coming with Skylanders restocks, and character releases. Whatever those are.

I mean, the only thing that was being shipped in the new-releases area along with Fifa 15 and F1 2015 was Skylanders re-orders and restocks. Management told me they can't keep up some weeks.


TL;DR

Buy $DIS calls, yolo some $MCZ stock, get long $ATVI as it turns into a growth story.",9
15-08-19,3hkwto,17 year old with some questions,"Sorry for this, its a bit of a read.

Hello all, as the title says I'm a 17 year old boy and i have questions that i thought would be answered at /r/investing. Alright so a little background, i've been working over the summer and i did the math, I'm going to make $3,081. thats not too bad considering I'm only 17, I'm going to put half of what i earn into a savings account and use the other half to spend on clothes or whatever else i'd like to because ya know people get the urge to buy things. so thats $1,540.5 in each account. eventually when i graduate highschool I'm going to be getting a job and with every paycheck I'm going to put half or some of my money in my savings account. basically i'd like to know what to do with the money. I'm not touching a penny in my savings account unless it is absolutely imperative, like rainy days or things in that nature. Ive seen a couple of posts about teens who want to get into the stock market but some people tell them to invest in something, i forgot what it was sorry. but i'd like to know what would be the smartest option to do with the money I'm saving. i want it to be so that as I'm growing up i have a decent amount of money put away. i figure if i start this early, when I'm in my 30s/40s i'd have enough money to maybe buy a house and see where i go from there. 

Also i don't mean to be rude at all, but please, don't tell me to go to college. I don't have my mind set on college for numerous reasons and i'd like you to respect those reasons. It would also be greatly appreciated if you could explain things in laymans terms or ELI5. Im only 17, I'm not an expert in the world of adulthood and investments but I would like to understand. And one last thing, if anyone is going to laugh at this post or anything negative please keep it to yourself, i just want to learn what would be good things to do with my money. 

Thank you for reading

If you are able to get a somewhat reliable algorithm going based off of Twitter and Google Trends, why not expand it? Has someone expanded it already?

I feel like you could use APIs from the top 100 websites in the world to build a relational database and create a set of criteria (an algorithm) to help predict movement in the stock market. For a PoC you could look at 20 companies within a 6 month window and correlate their price fluctuation based on what you scrapped from the top 100 sites within that same time frame. By looking at keywords, events, company info, stock info. I would think 10% of the decision on predicting movement would be based on actual stock info (EPS, P/E, PEG, etc) and the other 90% would be speculation based on the top 100 sites. From those sites you would be indexing keywords (positive and negative), PRs, promotions, new tech releases... pretty much anything that can be indexed will be index and given a value (from 1-10) of how positive and negative the words are. From there you would be able to heat map your criteria from the database and look for a trend or pattern related to price fluctuations in market prices.

15-08-19,3hjkxk,"How to find the problems in Enron's Annual Reports (2000 &amp; 1999) [pdf links and article inside]","*I've been meaning to re-read Enron's financials for a while and the discussion this week reminded me to do so. In addition to that, a little googling brought up a great article I've quoted from extensively below. Hope someone else finds this helpful!*

First, here are the Annual Reports in PDF: [2000](http://picker.uchicago.edu/Enron/EnronAnnualReport2000.pdf) and [1999](http://picker.uchicago.edu/Enron/EnronAnnualReport1999.pdf)

The annual reports are not very long, about 20 pages for the Y2000 financial statements and notes. The thing is, in the financial notes every sentence and every word counts, so attention to detail is essential.

From an article [1] in 2002, an ex-Enron employee was quoted as saying:

&gt; ""I think you can say with a straight face that we did disclose the suspicious activities."" But, he added, ""they are hard to understand, and nobody really wanted to roll up their sleeves"" to do it.

The article [1] goes on to explain where to find one of the problems or ""red flags"". This is a good example of the level of attention to detail that is required when reading the financial notes.

&gt;On the 51st page is a chart showing ""income (loss) before interest, minority interests and income taxes,"" known to financial experts as EBIT, earnings before interest and taxes.

&gt;It divides the income between Enron's business segments, such as wholesale services, broadband, etc. But it makes no distinctions between regular income and mark-to-market.

&gt;Back on page 38, in a footnote, is this sentence: ""The income before interest, taxes and certain unallocated expenses arising from price risk management activities for 2000 was $1,899 million.""

&gt;""Price risk management"" is Enron-speak for mark-to-market.
One must take that $1.9 billion back to page 51 and subtract it from the total earnings of the various divisions. Excluding Enron's pipelines and power plants, which don't use mark-to-market, it looks like Enron's other divisions had earnings before interest and taxes of $1.8 billion.

&gt;So, excluding the pipelines and power plants division, Enron doesn't seem to have a penny of income without mark-to-market.

“People eat duck and you think, well, we’ve got loads of chickens, leave the ducks alone!” – Karl Pilkington, An Idiot Abroad

Good day members,

It was our last night in paradise. One final celebratory dinner before packing up our things and heading home to begin school, baseball practices and music lessons. We would reluctantly kiss Key West goodbye the following morning. Our fantastic few weeks in the Conch Republic had finally come to an end…

Wandering into the backyard of a hundred year old cigar house, ducking the banana leaves and stepping over fallen mangos and coconuts, we arrived at the gathering. There were about 20 other people back there, all sipping on some alcoholic concoctions, some smoking stogies and a few of the older men playing dominoes. It was dripping hot in the tree covered yard, with no breeze penetrating the thick canopy. Even in the shade it was 95 degrees. The mosquitos were sweating.

The sounds of salsa music emanated from an old single speaker radio, and children’s laughter filled the air. In the back right corner, a small cage with two very quiet chickens… next to it, a chopping block and knife.

They were friends of my wife’s family; longtime residents of the island, going back generations. They kept many of the traditions of their Cuban ancestors, including Sunday morning church service followed by drinking and feasting all afternoon. This Sunday, it would be rum followed by an early dinner, then rum, some more rum, Cuban rum cake for desert, then some more rum.

I’d never seen a chicken butchered before. Even with a half-gallon of Bacardi coursing through my veins, I was taken back by the whole process. “It’s free range chicken, very good for you. I bet you’ve never had one like this before”, my new friend said.   He was right. But “free range?” I asked. The chickens were caged. Apparently, they’d only been caged a day… I promised not to tell anyone who my hosts were, as what they were doing was technically illegal. Their “free range” chickens were in fact wild chickens found all over the island. They weren’t supposed to catch them, let alone eat them.

As the rum bottles continued to disappear, our conversation focused on the birds roasting on the spit. My wife, a very health conscious, organic food loving, granola muncher was excited to try the “natural” poultry, and of course a jug-full of homemade mango sangria.

There’s been a movement in the chicken farming industry lately. You’ve probably seen the Perdue Chicken commercials touting their “antibiotic free” farming practices. In fact, privately held Perdue only uses human antibiotics in a very small percentage of their flock. Less than 5%.

Pilgrim’s Pride (PPC) America’s second largest chicken producer recently announced their goal to reduce antibiotics their flock as well. By 2019, they expect “only” 75% will be using antibiotics (outpacing most of their competition). The reason is simple, consumers are demanding it. Pilgrim’s Pride is not doing this to be good stewards. They simply see the trend and want to sell more chickens. The Key West chickens, on the other hand, are antibiotic free simply because they’re feral.

Antibiotic free chicken sales have increased by double digits per year since 2011. Both McDonald’s and Chick-Fil-A have announced they will stop selling chicken products raised on antibiotics important in human medicines. The trend is clear, poultry is going clean.

Looking at the Pilgrim’s Pride (PPC) chart over the past year you can see the stock has taken a beating.

investment-idea

However, after a recent low well under $20 per share, PPC seems to be on the rebound. After a quarterly report showing a sharp rise in profit, and the announcement of a $150 million share buyback program, the stock is now looking like healthy times may be ahead.

PPC’s main publicly traded competitor, Tyson Foods (TSN) is nearly three times the size. Boasting a market cap of $17.5 billion, TSN is also more than double the price (based on PE) of PPC. Tyson’s PE is 16, Pilgrim’s is “only” 7.

You may have noticed the price of poultry products has been rising lately. Everything from chicken wings to eggs has been going up, up and up. The culprit is the dreaded bird flu. More than 48 million American chickens have succumbed to the disease, crippling the supply of big farmers.

But this will not last forever. It’s been two month’s now since the last case was detected. Supply is once again rising, with an estimate of two years to full flock recovery. It’s this disease that has is partly responsible for the slide in share price of Pilgrim’s Pride, a poultry pure-play.

With the disease seemingly in the rearview, now may be the time go look at chicken stocks. And with PPC trading at less than half the PE of TSN, Pilgrim’s may be the best bet.

Another rum drink hits my hands along with a cigar. Standing over the spit, the smell of roasting chicken makes me salivate. “You see, these are not regular chickens. They’re a special breed of chicken only found here, and maybe a few other places, but mostly here. They were taken here a long time ago from Cuba as fighting cocks and hens. You’ll see how different they taste.”

Somehow another drink finds its way to my left hand, a mango mojito, prepared using the fruits on the property. Finally something refreshing I mumble to myself. The previous drinks were all rum and coke, not really my cup of tea, but I’m not one to be rude to my hosts. By now I’ve got quite the buzz on, from the cigar… yeah, the cigar did it.

Admiring the chicken slowly roasting before me, a strong desire to stay here overwhelms me. But that’s just not possible, maybe in another life.

Dinner was served around 3pm. The roasted “free range” chicken, black beans and rice with a side of fried plantains. My new friend was right; the chicken was like no other bird I had ever tasted. It was much more primal, gamey… delicious.

By 6pm my family and I wobbled back to our abode to pack for the short trip home. I’ll never look at those wild Key West chickens the same way. From here on out, I can only see those “free range, antibiotic free” birds turning slowly above an open fire.

LiveDeal Inc (NASDAQ: LIVE) doesn’t seem to be able to gain any traction lately. At the close of trading yesterday, shares were flirting with their 52-week low of $1.84 coming in at $1.85. The 6.2 percent slide comes on the heels of a $30k paid promotion to Stockpalooza.com who has been sending out promotional emails such as this:

“Not going to bore the crap out of you I`ll keep this very short! Hope you`re going to have a kick ass day to day Take a look at LIVE real quick a nice Nasdaq play here.”

Yesterday’s dip was nothing new. In fact, LIVE has seen a consistent drop over the past month of 17.3 percent and a whopping 51 percent over the past year.  The micro-cap Nasdaq listed company is struggling, and investors are paying attention as heavier than normal volume is the rule lately rather than the exception.

In July LIVE hired OTCJournal to promote the company for $15,000, which didn’t seem to help much at all either. According to one of their releases promoting LiveDeal, the company is like Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A):

 “You may recall a number of editions I've published in the past covering LiveDeal (NASDAQ: LIVE) - Or at least the artist formerly known as LiveDeal that is about to become LIVE Ventures as the company evolves into a mini Berkshire Hathaway. Yesterday, LIVE announced it had acquired a well established and highly profitable company (just like Warren Buffett).”

Not exactly true, to say the least, and though the promoter invoked the name of Warren Buffett, not effective either.

LiveDeal has a market cap of $30.34 million and hit a new 52-week low of $1.81 in trading earlier today after opening at $1.85. The 52-week high is $4.55. Trading is heavy with over 21 million shares trading hands thus far. The average is around 104 thousand.

Proceed with caution.

Federal authorities have brought charges against a Florida businessman for securities fraud. According to the SEC, Russell F. Haraburda, 60, of selling unregistered stock to finance a company that he claimed would make pet memorial products. In doing so, he bilked more than 100 investors out of more than $2.3 million. The scam covered thirteen states.

Yesterday, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a settled civil injunction against Haraburda and his company EnvraTends, Inc. (OTCMKTS: ENVR). Haraburda is the founder and CEO.

In the complaint filed in U.S. District Court, the SEC said Haraburda raised more than $2.3 million from mid-2009 through early 2014 by selling EnviraTrends stock to more than 100 investors in 13 states. He claimed the money would help build the company's business, including to list shares on a publicly traded stock exchange.

""Contrary to those representations, Haraburda misappropriated $1.8 million, or over 78 percent of the funds obtained from investors, spending it on personal expenses, including his mortgage payments, car and motorcycle payments, alimony, shopping sprees and personal travel,"" the SEC stated in the complaint.

""EnviraTrends never developed or sold a product or service, and never generated any revenue,"" it said.
Also according to the complaint, Haraburda filed false reports with the SEC and to investors and falsely stated that he personally loaned the company money.

Without admitting or denying the allegations, Haraburda agreed to repay $2.3 million and be barred from serving as an officer of a public company and from any future involvement with penny-stock offerings. However, all but $150,000 in payments would be waived, based on his financial condition. The proposed settlement still requires approval of the court.

Haraburda misappropriated 78 percent of investors’ funds, spending it to pay his mortgage, for car and motorcycle payments, alimony, shopping sprees and personal travel, the SEC said.",2

15-08-19,3hm0t0,Stock Dividends calculated into your total cost basis.,"I tried to look up if this question has been asked, but I maybe I'm not phrasing my question correctly so any direction would be helpful.  
I have an Australian eTrade account as well as an American eTrade account.  In Australia when I get paid a stock dividend it is then calculated into my cost basis so I see the total value of the stock including the ""free"" stocks I have received over the years bringing my cost basis down every time.  In America I have a specific stock that hasn't done well overall however the monthly dividends I receive are outstanding.  I would like to see this reflected in my portfolio.  Why is there a difference in this calculation between countries?  

Example: You have two lots of stock in XYZ company. Lot A equals 40 shares with a basis of $7 per share and Lot B is 60 shares @ $10 per share. their combines basis is $880. You receive a nontaxable stock dividend of 50 shares at $5 per share equaling $250. The new basis for the entire stock investment is $1130 for 150 shares of stock but the basis of Lots A and B changes.

Lot A: (40 shares÷100 shares) × 50 shares = 20 shares

New Basis = (40 shares × $7) + (20 shares × $5) = $280 + $100 = $380

Lot B: (60 shares ÷ 100 shares) × 50 shares = 30 shares

New Basis = (60 shares × $10) + (30 shares × $5) = $600 + $150 = $750

I want to then see the calculation of the stocks I didn't pay for calculated into my cost basis.  Does this make sense?

Two Citigroup (NYSE: C) affiliates have agreed to pay nearly $180 million to settle charges that they defrauded investors in two hedge funds by claiming they were safe, low-risk, and suitable for traditional bond investors. The funds later crumbled and eventually collapsed during the financial crisis.

Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (CGMI) and Citigroup Alternative Investments LLC (CAI) agreed to bear all costs of distributing the $180 million in settlement funds to harmed investors.

An SEC investigation found that the Citigroup affiliates made false and misleading representations to investors in the ASTA/MAT fund and the Falcon fund, which collectively raised nearly $3 billion in capital from approximately 4,000 investors before collapsing. In talking with investors, they did not disclose the very real risks of the funds. Even as the funds began to collapse and CAI accepted nearly $110 million in additional investments, the Citigroup affiliates did not disclose the dire condition of the funds and continued to assure investors that they were low-risk, well-capitalized investments with adequate liquidity. Many of the misleading representations made by Citigroup employees were at odds with disclosures made in marketing documents and written materials provided to investors.

“Firms cannot insulate themselves from liability for their employees’ misrepresentations by invoking the fine print contained in written disclosures,” said Andrew Ceresney, Director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division. “Advisers at these Citigroup affiliates were supposed to be looking out for investors’ best interests, but falsely assured them they were making safe investments even when the funds were on the brink of disaster.”

CGMI and CAI consented to the SEC order without admitting or denying the findings that both firms willfully violated Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, GCMI willfully violated Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and CAI willfully violated Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rules 206(4)-7 and 206(4)-8. Both firms agreed to be censured and must cease and desist from committing future violations of these provisions.",5

Being that my tolerance for risk is higher than some, I am ready to start learning simple options trades. I will tell you guys some basic information about a stock (what I paid and where I think the stock will be in about 10-14 days). I would really appreciate if you guys could recommend to me some of the options, that a person in my situation would play, and give me a general idea of each options overall risk to reward factors. 

I purchased ~ 250 shares of ugaz at 1.84, I think in 10-14 days the stock will be around 2.05, what options would you play, if you were in my shoes. 

I will not blindly play your advice, but I will use the recommendations for continued research, and more knowledgable paper trades, so that the next time, I feel as if I have a good read on a stock, I will know which options are available to me, and their overall level of risk to reward.

15-08-19,3hmsif,Cord-Cutting as an investment thesis,"Cord-cutters are finally having a measurable impact on subscriber numbers. There’s even a whole subreddit with 86,000 subscribers dedicated to cord-cutting.

As these numbers have worked their way into the market, we saw some interesting movements earlier this month. On August 4, Netflix had a massive positive day. The following day, all the traditional media companies fell.

http://www.alphahat.com/view/55d4b19bbdf6493c88000003

Since July 30, Netflix is the only winner in this group. Viacom, which owns HBO, has actually been the biggest loser despite its launch of HBO Now, which is a service specifically targeted at cord-cutters.

http://www.alphahat.com/view/55d399c39717ff4fe000000c

Lest you think this is a short-term trend, take a look at the performance of these companies year-to-date.

http://www.alphahat.com/view/55d4b34fbdf6493c8800000f

The market has already started taking this trend into account. Days To Cover, a measure of how much investors are betting a stock will fall (relative to its liquidity) is higher for all of these media companies.

http://www.alphahat.com/view/55d4b3d0bdf6493c88000014

Before you get too excited, let’s take a step back and look at some revenue metrics. Even though stock market performance has been much better for Netflix compared to traditional media, note that revenues for Netflix are still substantially lower.

http://www.alphahat.com/view/55d4b3f0bdf6493c88000015

Despite lower revenues, the market is clearly pricing in growth potential into Netflix. Netflix has a larger market cap than CBS and Viacom.

http://www.alphahat.com/view/55d4b411bdf6493c88000016

Now that the cord-cutting trend is manifesting itself in the markets, how will traditional content producers and distributors respond?

15-08-20,3hoc0u,Effects of Various Economic Conditions on the Markets,"When I asked Pauline about writing a second guest post here, she suggested I talk about factors that will affect the average investor’s retirement nest egg. So in this post, I’ll be discussing the various economic and historical conditions that will affect investors in the medium tern (1-5 years) and long term future (5 to 10 years out), and how you can prepare yourself when each of these conditions hit.

Inflation
Without going into the arcane and pointless details, I’ll explain QE (quantitative easing) in good ole’ plain English. QE is the Federal Reserve’s way of printing money, thereby injecting more and more liquidity (money) into the financial system. Bernake (Fed Chairman) believes that this will pull the American economy out of the muck for good, and right now, whether this is working or not is still questionable.

HOWEVER, quantitative easing does have a problem – the printing of money theoretically speaking should cause inflation. But since QE first began, inflation has been virtually non-existent. How come?

According to theory, printing money causes inflation. BUT, what the economy has been experiencing post-recession is a deflationary environment. The economy isn’t doing too well, and prices should be declining. But with the Fed’s printing of money, the deflation is negated, resulting in zero inflation.

However, sooner or later (probably sooner, along the lines of 1 – 2 years) inflation is going to (finally) pick up. Why? Think of it this way. Deflation has always existed, and the Fed’s printing of money has been negating this deflation. However, soon that negation will be over (when the inflation is sufficient enough to totally negate the deflation), and the printing of money will finally cause real inflation.

So what do you do when inflation hits? Historically speaking, investors think that inflation is bad for stocks. That’s a huge misconception. This misconception only exists because stocks went flat in the 1970s when inflation was huge. HOWEVER, the 1970s were an anomaly – we experienced stagflation, when inflation was coupled with a sagging economy. In most cases, inflation occurs in a growing economy (or in today’s case, a nominally growing GDP). I believe that this time around, the recovery is real and that we’re not going to experience stagflation.

Hence, I think that buying stocks would be great when inflation hits. When inflation comes around, currencies get devalued and nominally speaking stock prices rise, leading to greater returns for equity investors.

Devaluation
Devaluation is closely linked to inflation – when governments print money, the real value of their currencies becomes devalued. Whenever currencies get devalued, all hard assets such as stocks and commodities shoot up in price. Speaking of commodities…

The Once in a Lifetime Opportunity
People believe that precious metals are a hedge against an economic downturn. Again, that’s a misconception. When the 2008 recession hit, precious metals (gold and silver) actually fell the hardest. This misconception originates (again) from the 1970s when a crappy economy was coupled with soaring gold and silver prices.

Precious metals rose in the 1970s not because of the poor economy but because of inflation. The 1970s were a rare case of stagflation, something that doesn’t fit in with today. Currently, the economy is humming along, but inflation will be a big issue. Thus, when inflation starts to creep up it will be a once in a lifetime opportunity for medium term investors who are willing to hold onto their gold and silver positions for at least a year.

The Fight for Resources
There’s a prime fundamental reason (besides inflation) that supports the rise in commodity prices (especially gold and silver). It’s simple. We have fewer and fewer resources to feed a larger and larger population. When Thomas Malthus first predicted that the world would end (this was back in 1798), he forgot to factor in technology. Technological improvements can increase the efficiency at which we extract our resources. HOWEVER, even technology has a limit. The efficiency is ultimately limited to the amount of resources we have. Currently, the world is reaching a turning point. If all the emerging market nations start to consume at the rate Americans do, the world’s resources would be gone sooner rather than later. When the demand for raw materials goes up and the supply goes down, prices will soar.

Historical Charts
You’ve all heard it – historically, the U.S. stock market has yielded (on average) 7.5% returns. That’s actually a really clever lie concocted by brokers and financial groups to get you to purchase equities.

The “average of 7.5%” is from the post-War period. If you look at a different time frame, such as if you were to include the Great Depression, the “average rate of return” is a lot less. That’s what the financial industry does – repackaging facts to make them look better than when they first came in.

The post-war period is actually an anomaly, a period of unprecedented economic growth that is unlikely to be repeated again in the near future. This growth was caused by major technological revolutions, from household appliances to computers to the internet and high speed communications. Today? Come on guys – the market is going to grow at 7.5% with a bunch of undergrads making $0.99 iPhone apps.

My point is, if the stock market is going to pick up its pace in the long run, it needs to be supported by major technological leaps. Unfortunately, since the dawn of the internet our society’s brightest have been attracted towards the fast money of internet riches, drawn away from solid industries that actually contribute to mankind’s life (think of space mining, green energy – the capital intensive industries). Thus, without any major technological revolutions happening right now how can we expect economic and market growth to pick up? We can’t. There’s no driver for the growth engine.

The Summary
To sum it all up, I’m going to divide things into two time frames. The medium time frame is the 1-5 year outlook, whereas the long term outlook is 5-20 years.

For the medium outlook, things are looking decidedly positive. Once inflation picks up (which is inevitable with all the money printing), stocks and commodities are going to soar, particularly gold and silver whose bull markets aren’t over.

However, the long term is less positive. Sure, the stock market will still experience long term bull markets. But I don’t think the average rate of return will be 7.5% anymore, unless we experience another major technological breakthrough. The problem is that these breakthroughs are the results of years and years of work, something that hasn’t happened thanks to all our smartest engineers being attracted to industries that do not really contribute that much to mankind. (I like Facebook as much as the next guy in line, but hey, it hasn’t had as much an impact on my life as the advent of the computer has.)",1

15-08-20,3hodja,World drowns in oil as producers slug it out,"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/19/world-drowns-in-oil-as-producers-slug-it-out-.html

Oil prices continue to crater, and the bottom remains elusive because not one of the world's three largest producers shows any sign of blinking.

The latest leg down for crude came with U.S. weekly inventory data Wednesday which showed a surprise supply build of 2.6 million barrels last week, while analysts had expected a drop. West Texas Intermediate futures plunged 4.3 percent to $40.80 per barrel, a new six-year low.

""What we tend to think is these low prices will be around in our forecast for a couple of quarters,"" said Eric Lee, energy analyst at Citigroup. Analysts believe ultimately low prices should stop some of the production that is driving a supply glut, but that has not happened as quickly as experts had previously projected.

WTI oil futures look set to fall into the $30s per barrel, a low range that many analysts had previously not targeted. While Citigroup has been saying a drop into the $30s was possible, the latest revision to its official base case price outlook put WTI crude at an average $39 per barrel in the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year.

Oil analysts say forecasting the timing of a bottom in prices has been particularly difficult because of the unknowns around U.S. production, and most have now extended their forecasts for low oil well into next year.

But the two other producers in the top three are bigger, and they have each also had a significant impact on world supply, with no sign of abating.

Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest exporter, has been able to use its low cost base to put even more oil onto the world market. And Russia's dramatically weakened currency turns into a positive at home, helping the largest crude producer to lower production costs for its own oil industry.

An executive at Russia's state-owned Gazprom Neft Wednesday said Russian oil firms are weathering low prices and will continue to increase output even if Saudi Arabia drives prices lower with increased production.

""Today's prices haven't yet turned into a shock for the global oil industry. Many people hoped that it would hit the U.S. shale industry first and foremost but it hasn't happened so far,"" said Vadim Yakovlev, first deputy chief at Gazprom Neft told Reuters. ""That tells me that ... the Saudis could try to test new levels of resilience."" Yakovlev said production at many projects can stay viable even at $25 to $30 a barrel.

Citigroup expects Russian production to grow steadily and sees it up by 100,000 barrels a day this year to about 11.1 million barrels a day. It expects Saudi Arabia to produce about 10.2 million barrels a day, after hitting a record high this spring. Citi analysts see Saudi production at just under the 10 million barrel a day level next year.

These and other smaller producers, who have been aggressively battling each other for market share in Asia, continue to add to the more than 1 million barrel a day world oil glut. That makes finding the market bottom difficult.

""It is tricky,"" said Lee. ""Fundamentally, it makes a lot of sense that the fourth quarter of this year looks particularly bad because refining demand drops and driving season drops off ... if you get through the fourth quarter and you still have this oversupply, then maybe it's the second quarter of next year when you have this drop off in demand again.""

A number of oil analysts expect the next big drop, and possible bottom in prices, to come when the U.S. refining industry shuts down some capacity for maintenance between early September and early November. That industry has been processing about 17 million barrels a day, and refining maintenance would take 1 million to 1.5 million barrels off the run rate.

One surprising factor has been that U.S. shale producers have proven more agile with costs and technology than expected, and U.S. production is off its high but fairly steady at the 9.3 million barrel a day level, according to the latest EIA weekly data.
The agency also reported a sharp jump in U.S. imports to 8 million barrels a day in the past week, from 7.6 million barrels the week earlier.

""That was one of the most surprising statistics this week,"" said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. ""The U.S. remains an outlet for countries trying to maintain their market share of crude oil sales.""

Citigroup and other firms have changed their price forecasts to show a more prolonged downturn in prices that could ultimately cause a shakeout among producers. Lee said the factors that affect producers include production costs, storage costs and financial flows.

The swift drop in prices makes the financing environment more dicey for exploration and production companies this fall. In October, banks are set to review the credit lines of companies in the oil patch, and they are expected to clamp down.

""We're slowing down a little bit and a lot of investments have been canceled or postponed or delayed,"" said Lipow. ""It's just going to take some time to soak up the oversupply situation as the market anticipates the return of Iranian oil.""

When it comes to costs of production, Russia and Saudi Arabia have a big advantage over the U.S. Saudi Arabia's production is less than $10 a barrel, while Russia also has some production under $10, according to Citigroup.

U.S. shale producers, meanwhile, have varied costs depending on where they are located. Some of the high-cost production is already shut in, and Citigroup sees a cluster of production in the $30 per barrel area. Analysts and traders who took the CNBC Oil Survey last week were split on the break-even price for frackers, with 43 percent of the participants saying it was $45 to $55 per barrel.
Read MoreCNBC Survey: Oil prices seen below break even for frackers

While Russia and Saudi are lower-price producers, their economies are much more reliant on the contributions from oil.

""Their (Saudi Arabia's) fiscal break-even price of oil is hard to measure exactly. Some people peg it at $80 or $90. That's how much they need the price to be to balance their budget ... so they need to cut back spending,"" said Lee. ""By raising production, they do grow their revenues and bring down their break-even price. ... The other thing is they did not borrow and have massive borrowing power. ... We do think they are trimming costs."" 

Citigroup late last week revised down its forecast for oil prices, with a base case for $54 Brent this year. Citi analysts see $50 for Brent in the current quarter and $47 in the fourth quarter. They expect those price levels to stick through the first half of next year, with an average $53 per barrel Brent price for 2016.

For WTI, Citigroup expects the price this year and next year to be $48 per barrel, with the average third-quarter price $45 and the fourth-quarter price $39 per barrel. Citi gives a 55 percent probability to this base case.

Lee said Saudi Arabia is going head to head with other Mideast producers for share in Asia, where there is a 20 million to 25 million barrel a day oil deficit.

""A lot of the focus is on China. The Saudis are competing with the UAE, Iraq and Russia,"" he said. Saudi Arabia lost its spot as top exporter to both China and India in the spring, and more recently in Japan, according to Citigroup.

""That's the battleground within the battleground,"" said Lee of Asia.

For that reason, production may stay elevated as producers drive product into markets where they would like to build market share.

Lipow said one factor that could change things quickly would be an unanticipated geopolitical event that affects oil supply or threatens it.

""This is a type of market that has completely discounted any potential geopolitical risk,"" he said. ""You're not even hearing anyone talking about that. The market is so beside itself in bearishness, that's not even in the market's thinking.""",2
15-08-20,3hoe27,When is it time to hang up the yolo socks?,"Suffice it to say this market has ripped me a new one. I bought AAPL calls right before arguably the worst stretch the stock has had in nearly two decades. Two weeks ago I loaded up on DIA calls for September 4 expiry - and today my portfolio plummeted 50% in a span of two hours.

I am now debating whether to sell off the rest of my AAPL and DIA calls for whatever I can get at the open and go into turtle mode until this so-called rate-hike/correction/shemitah/collapse/armageddon does or does not happen.

I realize it will probably take me years to recoup what I lost in the span of a few hours with naked options. I'm thinking of starting off fresh with a nice conservative SPY iron condor for August 28 expiry, 205/206.5/208.5/211. I will then read [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Derivatives-Analytics-Python-Simulation-Calibration/dp/1119037999/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1440042860&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=derivatives+analytics+with+python) and try to figure out just what the hell I'm doing trading derivatives. If anyone has any other useful resources I'd appreciate a heads up - I am trying to gather info so I can regroup before getting back in the yoloctagon.

Hopefully you all have been weathering this storm better than me. Who knows - perhaps my selling will initiate the mother of all market rallies. Good night, and may the yolo be ever in your favor.",6

15-08-20,3hrwtx,Stocks crashing? The time to learn and understand cryptocurrency is NOW. This is not World of Warcraft gold folks- It is going to redefine global finance over the next decade (and make some people very rich).,"I think a frightening amount of people here don't actually understand what money is.  
  
In their minds it's still a piece of paper the government prints... But it's not.  Money doesn't exist; it's all imaginary.  
  
And we have, for the first time in history, a form of money that is private, instant, free, and decentralized.  This is honestly the most significant invention in the history of money...  And in true opportunity fashion everyone is overlooking it in its infancy.  
  
But mark my words: a day is coming soon when something unthinkable happens and the slow trickle of value going into the cryptocurrency universe will become a deluge.  
  
You're on Wallstreetbets because you want to YOLO on opportunity?  Well this is the opportunity of a century staring you in the face, but you're too busy sucking the dicks of Bezos, AMD, and Mickey Mouse to notice it.  
  
And no, all crypto is not deflationary.  Bitcoin is, but bitcoin does not represent all crypto.  In fact, there are superior technologies released in the last year that may even overtake bitcoin (like my top pick Monero).   
  
Some of you fuckers are still even messaging me asking about penny stocks.  PENNY STOCKS.  
  
STOP AND PAY ATTENTION TO THE POT OF GOLD AT YOUR FEET.  For fuck sake!  I'm not saying that there's not money in stocks, though you can enjoy your crash I've been warning you about for a while... But do you know what the hands-down number #1 investment was from 2009 until now?  Even with the crashes it was YOLO bitcoin.  
  
If you have any questions about crypto, I'll answer them because I honestly want to turn some of you speculator mother fuckers into millionaires but I'll be damned if you're not making it difficult.

15-08-21,3hsaog,Thinking about liquidity for individual corporate bonds,"Is position as a percentage of average daily volume as useful a measure of time-to-liquidate for corporate bonds as it is for equity?

As an example: the typical Google bond issue has $1B in face value (1MM bonds) outstanding and an average daily volume (last 30d) in the low thousands of bonds (~$1-5MM face value). If I need to figure out how long it takes to unload a position of, say,  $1MM in notional (a thousand bonds). Is 

1. assuming you don't want to be more than 10% of the market for it,
2. dividing the number of bonds by (avg_daily_volume * 10%)

A reasonable way to arrive at a ""days to liquidate"" figure? Or, is there a lot of ""hidden liquidity"" in this kind of thing that isn't captured by average volume? Should I instead be aggregating the ADV of all bonds with the same issuer, similar coupon, and similar maturity? Would it be better to look at bid/ask sizes and spreads? If so, is there a Bloomberg API field for that?

Bottom line: someone wants me to believe they can unload a thousand bonds from the same bond issue (the one with 2k ADV) within a day, no problem. I think it's going to take a week, at best. How do you model how long it takes to unload an individual bond?

I'm looking into adding another company to my portfolio, but my problem is which one.

Disney is in a huge price slump, due to ESPN revenues falling (i think).

caterpillar is a construction machinery manufacturer and they're revenues are slipping in regions, causing their price to fall. Correct me if I'm wrong. I see strength in their dividend, and they are consistent.

15-08-21,3hsciu,Been doing some research on AVXL.,"I've been doing research on numerous articles for avxl as it is a company that has massive promise and there is a very good amount of upward pressure on this stock. This primarily a result of the phase 2a trial, however I've done some personal research on the science of it, because the financials are irrelevant, what everyone wants to know is if the science is good. 

Thus I consulted my 28 year old sister who is currently done taking a 5 day a week 3 hour a day crash course on biology. She has also taken organic chemistry so I figured that she might know something. Anavex specifically says that it unfolds proteins in the brain that are linked to the neurodegenerative diseases. These proteins that were once folded in a correct way so that their functions were proper have now folded in a way that makes sense energy wise but not function wise. Thus they have folded incorrectly and this is what spawns the diseases. 

While anavex plus claims to cure this by simple unfolding the proteins and keeping them like that, my sister mentions that there are about 250-400 different types of proteins in the brain, so unfolding specific ones is very very difficult. Furthermore all proteins are made of 21 basic building blocks so this pill could turn out to cause massive detrimental side effects that have not been encountered. I say this because targeting a specific protein based on what it's made off could accidentally trigger other ones to unfold. This makes the science much more questionable, since it's very early to tell. 

The human brain is the organ we know least about so there is the most possible risk in this bio sector. I caution any of you that are playing AVXL seriously (5000$ and up) to re asses your risk and to take a step back from all the bullishness. I really think this could help people with Alzheimer's but if you've read ""flowers for algernon"" this could take a different turn, especially with something as delicate and mysterious as the brain.

15-08-20,3hoy5o,Why the Stock Market Is a Chance Worth Taking,"According to Bankrate.com, Americans invest most of their money into real estate. That makes sense. Real estate can be a good investment. But where do Americans put their money that isn’t invested in real estate? The stock market? No, unfortunately. The majority of Americans keep their excess wealth… in cash.

If that doesn’t depress you – it should.

 
The problem with cash is it loses value every single day. With inflation hovering around 3-4%, your cash becomes less and less overtime. It’s basically impossible to find a savings account, checking account, money market account, or certificate of deposit that will pay enough interest to fight back against inflation.

What Americans should be doing is investing in the stock market. But according to Bankrate.com, more than half of Americans avoid the stock market altogether.

The stock market wins over cash nearly every single year. Historically, the S&amp;P 500 has gained nearly 12% annually. This is why people like Dave Ramsey use that figure. Does 12% sound better than the measily 1% your bank account gets you? It should.

Getting Started with Investments

Investing can be scary – especially if you watch the news. There’s a lot of negative thoughts surrounding investing. But in reality, it’s how many people get wealthy. It’s hardly worth being pessimistic about. You should be overjoyed! The following are the 4 steps needed to begin investing. None of them steps are too difficult. But feel free to comment below with questions. I’ll answer them.

1. Determine Your Current Net Worth

How wealthy are you? Count everything that has a dollar assigned to it – house, car, existing investments, savings accounts, everything. It’s important to know your entire financial picture before investing. Reason being, it wouldn’t make much sense to start investing if all you have is high-interest credit card debt. You’ll want to tackle high-interest debt before investing anything.

2. How much money can be invested?

For maximum ROI, you’ll want to invest all your spare money outside of your emergency fund. Create a budget and determine how much money that is exactly. You also want to make sure you don’t invest money that you’ll soon need to buy a new car or fund an out-of-state move. Investing is a long-term financial decision.

3. Where should the money be invested?

There’s a lot to consider in this step. First, does your employer have any investment options? 401(k)’s with company match are fantastic. Contribute up to the match! Beyond that, open a Roth IRA and start contributing there. Once that’s filled, you’ll want to open a taxable investment account. This is where the non tax-advantaged money will go. Some popular brokerage firms include Vanguard, Fidelity, and TD Ameritrade. Customer support is good at all three of those firms. They can answer any of your brokerage-specific questions.

4. Create a Habit

In order to get that 12% ROI like Dave Ramsey talks about, you’ll need to dollar-cost-average. This means you put money in at regular intervals. Many people will contribute, say, $150 every 2 weeks into their Roth IRA. What you want to do is set your investments to autopilot. The buy and sell, scream and yell mentality won’t get you anywhere fast. Let’s stick to the 12%.

The Stock Market Isn’t Scary

Day trading may be scary but true ‘buy and hold’ investing isn’t. Buying and holding spreads your risk out greatly. Instead of betting on one company, you’re really just betting that the stock market will grow year after year. That’s a pretty safe assumption.

The stock market is a chance worth taking. Just remember to spread risk, dollar-cost-average, and get on autopilot. It’s time you put your money to good use.",1

15-08-20,3hpvs8,"""The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent""","Hopefully somebody can learn from this experience. At the beginning of January I shorted WLL and OAS (two ND shale oil stocks). It was after the most ideal time to short these stocks, but I had only really started to pay attention to the oil bust at this point. **Lesson 1: Don't chase good trades**

A few years before I did my Master's econ thesis on oil elasticity so I have a decent background in the area. After reading up on the situation extensively I came to the conclusion that due to the massive supply glut and the weakening worldwide demand we were in for a potentially epic collapse. I decided these highly in debt shale oil companies were in big trouble because of their debt and their high cost of production. 

It started well and I had quick 20% gains. **Lesson 2: Take good profits when you have them, especially on a volatile short** After this though the oil market rebounded for a bit. It was trading off the Baker Hughes rig count for a few weeks, which didn't make any sense at all to me. This metric was an outdated one that for some reason was getting all this media coverage. Even though the number of rigs was falling, there was still a MASSIVE amount of oil and drilling. Also, traders were buying space on tankers to buy and store oil because they were so sure it would bounce back and wanted to profit. It seemed to me that this was all nonsense and rationally oil should continue to tank. Anyways these stocks came rocketing back and finally I had enough and closed out of my trades after losing about 10% of my initial investment. They continued to go higher the few days after I covered so that was good at least. It sucked and I was over messing with oil at all any more. 

Of course since then, oil has resumed it's plummet. If I had stayed in those trades I would be up over 50% on them. I don't feel so bad though because I needed to get out and couldn't risk losing more on a short like that. **Lesson 3: Don't short if you don't know what you are doing**. 

I had knowledge on the subject and what was in the long term a decent call but always remember **Lesson 4: The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.**

Be careful with oil right now in general btw. Who knows where it is going from here. Though at some point it will be a tempting long play. ",91

15-08-20,3hpg6a,Daily Nifty Outlook," Working with different time frames of a chart provides much better clarity in understanding what could be the most likely next move in it. A good analyst never arrives at a conclusion just by looking at a chart in isolation. Starting today we are going to discuss what could unfold in Nifty on day to day basis. Even though I will not be populating any other Nifty time frame chart except daily chart, I would like to disclose that the forecasts that you would read in this blog in Nifty or for that matter any other stocks is arrived after looking into different time frames.

I work with monthly, weekly and daily charts. I used to look at hourly and 15 min chart, however I have stopped using it on regular basis as time frames above daily chart works better for me in terms of forecasting. I invest in markets and do not trade now a days and hence I have also restricted looking at charts when markets are live. This is how this blog is going to shape up from today, daily outlook from Tuesdays till Fridays; intermediate outlook on Mondays and occasionally major outlook as and when things unfold. Apart from all these knowledge sharing would also be focused, as I believe everyone who is reading this blog should not only follow me on markets rather learn and develop one’s own style in forecasting markets. Knowledge sessions would be on weekends.

Looking at the chart, and focusing more on the up move that happened from 7940, clearly shows how Nifty has held up in a tight range. An unconvincing 700 points move on the upside and held back in a tight range. This chart shows a different picture to that of the other charts that we were discussing earlier this week. If you were look at the exact points in this Nifty chart, you could find one thing in common, Nifty has been making lower highs and higher lows; a perfect example for non-trending phase of market.

The good news is we are going to move out of this range very soon. Once we break this congestion zone either on the upside or downside, we are going to see another round of 500-600 points uninterrupted. A two days consecutive close below 8380 marks break down of this zone and a two day consecutive close above 8530 marks a broke out of this zone on upside. It’s always risky to trade in a tight range but a good jobber loves this kind of market situation as he has multiple entry exit opportunities.
Will keep you posted on daily outlook with levels as and when things starts to unfold in Nifty.",1

When I first started trading I didn't use fundamentals or Technicals just crappy news sources, and I would hope for certain companies to get approval, or I would hope that a law would pass that would  cause my stock to sky rocket . I was speculating without any logic, I was a gambler not a trader.

So I would go from opinionated article to opinionated article buying and selling based off of my erratic emotions, got completely hammered by slippage from trading frequently. Ever time I lost I would put more money into the market in hopes of making up for my loss. I did the opposite of what I was suppose to, I traded with my emotions.

I did absoulety horrible.Lost 8k.

This time around I am putting in the work. Stopped being lazy did some reading on Benjamin Graham, read technical analysis for dummies. Got my first Technical analysis software subscription.

15-08-21,3hteeo,What if the dollar corrects instead of equities?,"I keep reading about people holding tons of cash in anticipation of a correction because apparently everything is overvalued and the fed raising rates a quarter of a point a year will make everyone flee stocks en masse.  But what if the opposite were to occur?  What if a bluffing fed and continuation of QE (or some other macroeconomic/geopolitical chain of events) caused the dollar to fall sharply in a short period of time?  Would equities not become drastically more expensive as the relative purchasing power of the dollar fell?

In other words, if someone sells 80% of their holdings so that they can sit on a pile of cash and wait for a correction that may never come, isn't there a significant risk of everything going in the opposite direction instead -especially when the dollar is currently so strong?  Wouldn't the best strategy be to simply have a widely-diversified portfolio, perhaps favoring a slightly above-average cash allocation due to current market fears?

I only ask this out of my own insecurity about the market and my inability to fully understand the complex relationship between the dollar and U.S. equities.  I think the effect of a strengthening/weakening dollar on imports and exports is pretty clear-cut, but beyond that it gets foggy and rather unpredictable for me in my limited education and experience.

tl;dr: isn't the fear of being in cash just as poignant as the fear of being in equities?",3

15-08-21,3htivw,"Why S&amp;P &gt; Berkshire?","Dear Community,

I have two major questions after reading a lot from Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger.

First of all, Buffett himself recommends index funds for nonprofessional investors.
Buffett's quote: ""Put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&amp;P 500 index fund. (I suggest Vanguard’s. (VFINX))"".
That sounds fantastic and really makes sense to me, and I noticed that's the same what /r/investing recommends.
My question: Why not invest in Berkshire instead? Neither Buffett nor /r/investing seems to recommend going 90% into BRK.
Berkshire outperforms any index and is a comparable collection of well managed and hand-picked companies, isn't it?

Secondly, Buffett often talks about him being comfortable when the stock markets close (""Ask yourself if you are comfortable with your investment when markets close for a couple of years"" or something along those lines).
What I don't understand is how can a small time investor like myself actually benefit from a companies earnings and profits. It's not that I'm percentually entitled to the profits of the company with my stock holdings, right?
Unless the company pays a dividend, but let's assume the company doesn't pay a dividend for the sake of the example

Thank you!",1

Unfortunately there are some miserable and immature jerks on here too.  You may be lucky enough to avoid them.  You may be unlucky and unwittingly make yourself a target.  That was me.  I had fun with Reddit for the last couple of years - but this last run-in made it clear to me that I need to spend way less time on Reddit and way more time connecting with the real people in my life.  I have a serious job and a family and I've been very successful by almost any standard - and I did most of it without Reddit.  It has been a winning formula for me and although I've had some interesting and insightful conversations here, the anonymity it provides is abused too often for my liking.  So with that in mind I'm writing this more as personal therapy than anything else.  By and large, Reddit has become a time-waster for me and I need to leave it behind for good.  If you can use it in moderation great.  I couldn't.
So with that I'm leaving the best investment and career advice I have.  Lessons learned from r/investing, from actual investing, and from life.  If it helps you, great!  To the straw that broke the camel's back:  I hope you get the help you need.  I don't know what kind of help that is - but I suspect it is not on the internet.

The best advice I can give to you is to be humble.  Learn to be comfortable with the fact that you do not know everything.  You can be a valuable and treasured friend, adviser, coworker, manager, or employee so long as people trust that you understand the boundary between what you know and what you don't know.  The moment people in your life suspect that you may not know what you're talking about, they will cast doubt on everything you say.  The best indicator of someone who can be trusted is someone who will fearlessly say, ""I don't know the answer"" or ""I don't understand that completely.""  That may not get you hired at Amazon.com - but it will make you a great part of any team, and it will keep you employed, and it will earn you respect.  Take the same approach with your investing.  Investing is not you vs. the market.  It is you vs. yourself.  Be fearless in accepting what you understand and what you don't understand.  If you want to try a new strategy or a new position in your portfolio, try it on a small scale and learn from watching what happens to it - and what you will learn is probably more about your personal appetite for risk than anything else.  In investing, just like in life, experience is the best teacher.
I was on here because I wanted to learn, and I wanted to help.  After 21 years in the industry, I thought it would be fun, I thought I would make some connections.  But it really didn't do that - and I regret the time I spent on here because it took me away from my family and my job.  So for the 161,794 people on here that mean well, good luck to you.  I'm going to assume for selfish reasons that the above will help just 8 of you or so.  I'll feel good about that.  Upvote it.  Downvote it.  Do whatever Reddit does.  Enforce whatever cultural rules and etiquette seem appropriate to you.  Create and curate your sub.  But remember this - almost all the meaningful experiences you will have in life - in family, friends, business, or whatever...  Almost all those moments will be shared with people that know you by your first and last name.  Good bye.",0

15-08-21,3htw7e,I cant choose between GE and DIS,"Hey guys, I am still pretty new to the stock market world. I currently own Netflix, Starbucks, MRGE..

I have about $2,000 to put into a stock and I can't choose between DIS and GE.

DIS is great and everybody raves about it on here. I like the company and believe they will be around for a very long time. I love  what they are doing in the movie world and also now they are expanding their park with 14 acres of land for their Starwars land. The only thing holding me back is all this ESPN talk. If ESPN truly is 50% of Disney's income and if it keeps going down that seems like it would bring DIS down a lot. 

GE has been around since the late 1800's and they have income coming in from a lot of products. GE also has a much higher dividend yield which is a bonus but not that important to me. The problem I have with GE is that from what I can see from looking at their chart in the past year they have dropped in price and in 5 years they have gone up around 11 points. Whereas Disney has gone up around 90 points. If this trend continues then Disney would be a better investment. 

I want to keep long term at least a few years. Dividends are a bonus but not required.

15-08-21,3hvu4d,Short selling Korean defense stocks before 3am CST on Saturday,"I've been hearing about some publicly traded Koren military supply companies stock prices soaring after tensions between the North and South are escalating again. A lot of people seem to think that this isn't going to escalate into a full war. Many people seem to think that the North shot some things into the south to get other countries to send aid to the North in return for them to keep the peace. This seem likely as North Korea has just gone through a major drought which is making their food supply problem even worse than it was to start with. If North really was going to attack the south they probably wouldn't announce when they would attack (3am CST) like they just did. I think the situation is most likely going to deescalate thus causing the Korean military supply companies stock prices going down to normal. What are your thoughts reddit?",1

15-08-21,3htyts,Get Lemons Make Lemonade,"Quick bit of background info. I am 26 years old, self employed, live in the UK. Own a property with my gf worth £180,000 with a mortgage of around £137,000. Together we bring in around £64- £70K per year. Have no credit card debts, and owe around £10K on a loan (2.9% interest rate) that was used to renovate the property we are now in. On a normal month I can put away 1K into my savings, whilst still paying all the bills etc. I do not have a pension other than the state pension. 

So as the saying goes when you get lemons make lemonade, well I have just been given my share of lemons it seems in the way of a brain tumor, and am looking how to make lemonade. Fortunately I took out a critical illness policy before all this started so will be expecting a lump sum of approx 134K (enough to pay off outstanding mortgage as we only moved in 1 year ago) to use as I please.

What would be the best move with this money?

The mortgage I have is a tracker and I am paying £735 per month (3.9% above base rate). From where I am sitting right now there seem to be only one or so options (my judgement is a little clouded as I have a stomping headache).

Do I:

A) Pay off the mortgage in full, start saving again and purchase another property, keeping my current also and rent it out, this would bring me a rental income of around £600-£700 a month. I could then repeat this process to purchase further properties down the line. 

B) Pay off part of the mortgage, use the rest as a deposit on a new place?

C) Invest the money somehow? your suggestions and guidance are much appreciated?

Any guidance is much appreciated, as all being well (assuming I make it through everything health wise) this is a once in a lifetime opportunity that I am keen not to screw up.",14

I'm going to say, I got 100% lucky. The precision of my charting was okay for where the implied vol lines were going to go, but this is probably the dumbest thing I've ever done.

Started out with a 201/200.50 and 200/199.50 bull put spread, that just happened to go LIVE today, for credits of 0.12 and 0.07.  These limit orders were in 3 days ago and were determined by my chart (approx 1.5 std).  So, I get home and I see the market is blowing donkey dick, so I enter a 198.50/198, bull put spread also to make up for the earlier two spreads. Who would've though, that blows too. So what do I do as any other good WSB does?

I swing for the fences.

20x 197.50/197 bull put spreads, 5 198.50/199 bear call spreads, and a 30 minute fucking roller coaster ride to the end. I manage to cover a $90 loss and make a profit of $60. 

SPY closed within 0.08 cent of my spread most strike.

Is this what's called the ""spread"" then? If I understand correctly this is due to a diescrepancy in bid/ask and most likely because the share is not traded very often, right?

15-08-20,3hre0h,DIS | Brief Analysis on its Future Prospects,"I have seen a troubling thing in r/investing lately where DIS is discussed in a way that leads new investors to believe there is almost no risk with Disney.  Just a few of my opinions on DIS trajectory.  I have no shares in DIS but I think it is an absolutely great company.  With that said,



The major headwind for Disney is of course the risks of significant revenue/profit decrease as its media portion, specifically ABC and ESPN, stand to lose a lot with the shift to streaming platforms rather than cable.



1.  DIS has significant earnings risk with the current transition from bundled cable TV to streaming platforms.  Disney currently makes roughly ~30% of its profits from ESPN/Media business.  This is part of Disney I believe will not be able to keep its current level of profitability.  Disney makes a significant sum from ESPN as it practically has a monopoly on sports broadcasting in the US.   Disney is able to extract a lot of money from cable companies as almost all cable subscribers watch some type of sport, so not paying Disney's fee would make the cable companies lose a lot of subscribers.



2.  Disney should be able to supplement some of this income loss with income from streaming.  I doubt this will be even close to the amount Disney currently commands from cable companies.  Streaming provides a much more fragmented customer base in my opinion, as Disney was able to get paid even for the cable subscribers who didn't watch sports, as it came included.  



Most people invest in Disney because it is a world renown brand, known for it theme parks, films and ecosystem of related content.  While this part of the business is still incredibly important for Disney, most new investors don't realize that Disney has a lot of exposure to the Media industry I mentioned above.  Parks and recreation revenue is growing at a solid pace, but earnings in Disney are in jeopardy as the trend of cable cutters continues.



With that stated, I believe Disney is still a fantastic company.  My personal opinion is that Disney is going to have a rough couple months and years ahead of it.  The signal for me to buy will be when Disney stabilizes it's Media portion of revenue and get a foundation where investors can be comfortable knowing what ESPN streaming revenue will look like.  A major thing I like about Disney is it's management.  Warren Buffet has always had the view of buying undervalued companies, but also companies that have a moat and that have terrific management.  Disney has both of those.  Its management is world class and has been able to consistently grow and turn Disney into a conglomerate.  I have the utmost faith in management to steer Disney through rough patches.  



If you are a long term investor and already bought stock, you should hold, and not worry yourself about this price dip.  If you are like me and do not own stock, I would wait until Media revenue stabilizes.",46

15-08-20,3hret2,Keep Calm.,"Hey guys,

I wanted to drop a quick note to the newer stock players here, since today's move might be a new type of action to many.

Remember that panicking out is rarely the right move.

Remember to choose your horses carefully, especially if you're trading naked (without covered calls or other hedging).

Remember to stay calm.

Remember to question anyone who claims to know what's going on.

Personally, I do not assume that today was a one-off event; there's no reason S&amp;Ps can't go below 2k, and personally I wouldn't be surprised if they hit to the mid 1,900 level. But that's just my assumption. It's okay if you disagree with me; in fact it's great, and what makes for two-sided markets. But, *do not think that after a down day like this that the markets cannot slide further.* It's absolutely possible, and if I were still as active a trader as I once was, I'd be shorting bounces.

One final tip, if you're bearish and naked (heh), remember that dividends pay you to wait for a market turnaround. Oil company stocks, T, and many others will pay you to kick your feet up and wait, and you don't have to look if you don't want to.

Good luck everyone!",54

Right guys? Selling then was a great idea).

COH - I just like Coach. Their modern luxury brand shift is going to take them far and help them outperform the luxury handbag market with or without Chinese tourists.

15-08-21,3hup2d,How to shore up your margin account:,"Ok so clearly a lot of you fucked up risk management and your 200x ES contracts went the wrong way. 

The responsible thing to do is ""close your account, pay whatever you owe your broker/FCM, and rebuild"". Yet you also know that selling now is fucking stupid. 

So here's what you do:

1. Call all your banks and tell them you need to make a large purchase that goes over your credit limit. All large banks (Chase, BoA, AMEX etc) will allow at least twice your limit if you promise to pay the excess in 1 month. You cannot carry this balance to the next statement cycle. 

2. Purchase Visa Debit gift cards with credit cards. I'm talking about [these things](http://deltapoints.boardingarea.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/visa-debit-gift-cards-and-flexperks-card.jpg). 

3. Buy money orders with the debit gift cards. This is a pin-debit transaction.

4. Send the money orders to your brokerage/FCM account.

And if you end up with both a margin loan and a credit card loan.... Down the road, not across the street.",9

First of all, is the market on a constant uphill trend? Obviously there are dips and recessions, but I remember it being a big(ish) deal when the DOW broke 18000 points. In the future, will we be at 30000 points etc, or is there some sort of expected limit that will be hit? How does all that work?

Second, can corrections be thought of as a new ""base"" for the stock, in a sense? If XYZ reaches $100 and then corrects to $90, will the next phase be another upwards trend to, say, $120 before correcting to $110 (just to put some numbers out there) and continuing an upwards trend (assuming a good stock, normal market, no recession etc)?

Third, any other things to know about corrections in general?",6
15-08-20,3hrh70,Pump and dump vs Very rich person,"I was just wondering what the difference a pump and dump scheme is versus say a single billionaire who just buys up a crap load of shares at a specified price to artificially inflate the demand of the stock's price.

15-08-21,3hwo1s,"You lost 3% in your portfolio today, let’s take a deep breath and talk about it","**An atmosphere of fear has set into equity markets** that hasn’t been seen in some time. If you turn on MSNBC you will get host after host at least calling a market correction and some calling a doomsday. If you are watching your portfolio by the hour you might even be feeling the slow onset of nausea as you realize how much you’ve just lost by not timing the market. (You shouldn’t try to time the market by the way.) It’s important in times like these to take a step back and think rationally about the market before we let our emotions drive our investment decisions.

So what happened? The Fed wants to raise rates, Greece just became a problem again, manufacturing is down in China, commodities are hitting new lows with the oil supply glut leading the way, all of a sudden television isn’t the medium of choice for Americans (but neither is Netflix?) the Koreans want to kill each other, they’ve always wanted kill each other but now they might just go for it, everyone thought China would start buying our stuff in never-before-seen quantities, now we are realizing the emperor has no clothes and China isn’t so spectacular.

**Let’s talk about China:** If you’ve been following the advice of people here or anywhere else you probably bought apple, and you probably held apple after it hit $133. Now we are finding (or we already knew) that a major component of Apple’s valuation was the expectation of future sales to China. This is not just affecting Apple though, go look at Celenese for instance, or most of consumer and manufacturing sectors of the S&amp;P 500. We trade a lot with the Chinese and some have overestimated their ability to buy our stuff. What’s wrong with China? For starters China does not actually have a functioning free market, so get any illusion out of your mind that they have the same legal structures that promote the incentives of private actors to make money like we have here in the U.S. The Chinese market does not even allow shorting. If you have been reading the news coming out of China they say they are aggressively pursuing the prosecution of short sellers… what’s wrong here? They do not have short sellers, but they do have sellers. Lots of them. And they want to stop them from selling their own equity positions. China may not have a free market, but they still have free market forces, and they can fight all they want to make certain economic truths untrue, but as Herbert Stein said: “what cannot go on forever will eventually stop” So what is going to stop? Over the past Year and a half we have seen the Chinese stock market expand by 250% and Earnings fell 3% this last year on average. All the while the Chinese state run media basically pulled an extended pump and dump propaganda extravaganza to prop up their market (they don’t actually believe in dumps though.) The credit expansion of asset backed securities in China helped facilitate this bubble (in simple terms the typical Chinese investor mortgaged their homes and placed that same money in the stock market.) Now the new symbol of the Chinese economy is a lonely man selling his prized Lama in the street so he can just hold on to his house. 

**Let’s talk about the European Union:** Investors are waiting for Greece or another poor EU country to back out or fight the EU on their debts. If you ever read Michael Lewis's [article on Greece](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2010/10/greeks-bearing-bonds-201010) or his book Boomerang you know that the health of most major banks in the EU depends on these smaller countries to act as conduits as the ECB and IMF send money through them to the banking system. Before 2008 many large financial institutions in Europe took major positions in Third World EU debt (that’s a joke.) But more Seriously Greece has created a contagion, the idea of a default is becoming more intriguing to the masses of young unemployed citizens in Greece Spain and Portugal. Meanwhile the Germans still feel guilty for WWII and want to pay the world back by creating entitlement waste in other countries. Think about it this way: if I borrowed $5,000 from Warren Buffet he would own me, but if I borrowed 50 Billion from Warren Buffet, and suddenly I couldn’t pay him back, I would now own him. Ladies and Gentlemen Greece has an economy the size of greater Los Angeles and 1.2 Trillion Euros in Debt (and this is a conservative estimate.) They will not pay this back in the long run, they cannot afford to. They struggle to collect taxes. They cannot contain corruption within their own government. The EU is an unsustainable ticking time bomb, Greece is just the tip of the iceberg.

**Let’s talk about the Federal Reserve:** and right off the bat can we recognize that the Fed is out of ammo? They cannot stimulate the market anymore. We have seen some of the most aggressive multiple expansion in the history of the United States equity markets since 2008, spurred by Fed Policy and now they want to raise rates and take it all back? They essentially cut the Weighted Average Cost of Capital to new lows for our entire economy, making nearly every positive Internal Rate of Return project for every company positive on a Net Present Value basis as well. We just suspended our creative, volatile, constructive capitalism and made the majority of our businesses winners over the last seven years and what now? There are no consequences for this at all? That project to revamp and expand the HR department of your typical mid-size company will no longer be NPV positive as the WACC could retroactively increase in an environment of rising interest rates. Don’t discount the importance of the term structure of corporate debt. The tide is about to go out and you will see who is still wearing a swimsuit and who is swimming bare ass naked. 
So where do we go from here?

**Remember the best thing that can happen for a young investor is a crash**(sorry dad.) I’m going to guess that the majority of r/investing is near my age (mid-twenties or mid-thirties) and we want a stock market crash, we should welcome it. We are not investing for returns tomorrow, we are investing for returns 20-30 years from now, and the greater losses now the greater gains we will have in our 401k’s our IRA’s and even for you trust fund babies too. Look, some of us have been waiting for a cheap asset class to appear for half a decade, now it looks like every asset class is about to get cheap. I want to buy the S&amp;P 500 at a deep discount over the next few years of my life and you should too.

**Let’s put some things in perspective as well,** investing in the United States is like bowling with bumpers, you are going to hit some pins and get a decent score. China on the other hand is a gutter ball. We are fortunate to live in one of the most diverse (by industry) and free markets in the world. Not only that, earnings are actually still growing, despite the global contagion of artificial interest rates, currency manipulation by China, and on and on. Our economy has an advantage because we have embraced a fantastic combination of capitalism and oversight that has created the most prosperous country in history ( save for Monaco but they cheated) and we should welcome cheaper goods from China, $40 dollar oil is going to be great for my morning commute, and let’s welcome the flight to safety as foreign investors will continue to look to the United States as a safe haven for capital. In the long run it’s going to be okay, because 30 years is a long time and this market uncertainty creates buying opportunities. There is blood in the water and you’re a shark, go find something to eat.

**What buying opportunities should we look for now?** There are specific strategies that create downside protection as the near term investment outlook becomes uncertain. Some believe gold will be a good hedge, and at some points in the past it has been, it might work, I would rather hold some other stuff but that’s a difference of opinion. Even better, take a look at VIX, not that proshares bullshit that’s easy to buy and a great way to lose all your money. Go look at VIX: the CBOE basket of implied volatility for options, and then go look at some time series return data for VIX over the past 10 years. Vix by definition works as a hedge for market uncertainty because it is a reflection of implied volatility, and it is a great way to smooth out returns over the long run. If market uncertainty makes your stomach turn, wait for things to calm down again and then go hedge yourself with a portion of your portfolio in a rolling basket of VIX call options, if you want to know more about how this works feel free to PM me. Dividend stocks are a great place to find safety, value stocks are a great place to find safety as well. Look towards emerging markets for some safety as well (think Chile.) Multiple expansion has been relatively limited in some emerging markets and will allow you to find good deals now while things remain tentative here in the United States.

**And most importantly, it’s just money, there are so many problems that money can’t fix so let’s be thankful it’s just 3% and stay focused on a rational investment strategy moving forward.**

**edit:** Wow I did not expect this to blow up. I went out to grab drinks with my Fiance and all of a sudden this happened.. First off I must say that I truly appreciate the comments both positive and constructive and I appreciate the messages (I got A TON of messages.) If you are looking for market predictions... I am not your guy. This is an explanation of market sentiment as I perceive it to be, not what happens on Monday when the market opens, don't ask me what to do with your money this is the internet. This could be a market correction, or we could see a rebound, and I am not trying to predict the future. I just found it all so fascinating I had to word vomit my thoughts.

**Secondly** Monaco is a nation the size of my back yard (that a joke) and has made a business of being the tax haven of Europe (seriously) so the wealth/capita ratio is absurd. I was there just weeks ago and saw the most ridiculous yacht club I have ever seen (I am not a rich man) so I just had to throw in a reference. Guys if you get the chance go see Monaco, and go to the aquarium... it is amazing!

**Finally** Yes Chile exports 25% of GDP to China according to Wikipedia (nice one!) That doesn't mean supply and demand disappeared on 8/21/2015, so if China loses 30% of their value in equity markets that 25% didn't just evaporate into thin air... also you can find specific positions in ADR's or positions in foreign accounts that are fairly or conservatively valued with little exposure to China in Chile or other emerging markets. We are all sensitive to the low interest rate environment and how it has propped up equity valuations here in the U.S... Could you just consider for a moment that emerging markets have a different exposure to other macroeconomic risks and aren't as sensitive to the 10 year T-bill rate? it is not a perfect hedge, and you aren't a perfect investor either, so do your research and get off my ass

**Edit #2: VIX options** I am getting a lot of messages with specific questions about Vix. So let me explain what I do, and maybe you will like it or do something similar. What I meant by rolling VIX options is set aside a certain amount of implied volatility that you want to hold, lets say 6%. There are 6 maturities for these options, 1 month 2 month, 3 month etc. I pick the 6 months, I like the maturity at a later date because I don't get crushed as much by holding every day. So over 6 Months I put 1% of my portfolio into 6 Month call options until a day like today and I sell ALL of it. Then I start rolling money back into VIX options when it falls to the $12-$13 dollar range. I haven't always done this, and I won't always do this, I think the environment today calls for some sort of hedge against these macro economic risks I talked about.

15-08-21,3hwobs,Serious question - Why is selling a bad thing?,"I've got a good deal of money invested across a few pretty low-risk ETFs like QQQ and IVV, and I don't need any of the money I've invested in the short term. I know that the market is cyclical and that regardless of how low it goes, my money will eventually return if I simply *don't do anything*.

That said, it's human nature to sell and jump from a sinking ship, and I just want to understand *why* people are so aggressively advising others (in similar situations to me) not to sell. I'm not an investing expert, but I'm a pretty damn reasonable and logical person so I made a list of what *I think* the potential *negatives* of selling in this situation would be. 

* You don't know when the market will hit the bottom. If you sell now and expect to buy back in at a cheaper price, you could miss it completely and end up having to buy back in at a more expensive price.
* You lose dividend payouts, which could actually increase with the decrease in share price. (I really don't know much about this, so feel free to educate me)
* The expected net value of trying to time the market like this will only be higher than the expected net value of just waiting it out over the long run if you have a very good estimate of how long the market will continue to drop for, which you don't.  (again, this money is not money that I need immediately and could easily survive without touching it for years, which is why the expected value of just waiting it out will ultimately be positive once the market makes it back to its current levels)

And here's my list of what *I think* (again, I'm not an expert) the potential *positives* of selling in this situation could be. 

* If you sell now and time the market dip just right, you could buy back in to the market at a cheaper price, not to mention the fact that you'd be able to buy *more* of the market. 
* Once you sell, you lose the risk of losing any more money and could reinvest the money immediately in something else that could ultimately yield you more profit than just waiting it out for the market to return. 
* If the market truly *truly* crashes, then a) you've got your money and b) you can go to town and invest in things that you could never have afforded to invest in before the crash. 

So, yeah I understand that selling in my situation (again, my situation is that I don't *need* the money that I've invested anytime soon) is more risky because I don't know how long the market will continue to drop for, but there also appear to be potential advantages of selling (I guess this is what they call being a bull?). 

Anyway, I just want to know what experienced investors really think about the points I've laid out.

For those of you unaware, here is an [Investopedia Article on Tax Liens](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/061313/investing-property-tax-liens.asp).

Basically, the when people fail to pay their property taxes, a lien is placed on the property. The County can then auction off those liens, they are often sold to the person who bids down the lowest interest rate. In my state, Florida, the auction starts at 18% interest and goes down from there according to the bids. 

You pay the lien in full and now the delinquent home owner is responsible to pay you the entire amount of the lien plus interest. 

If the lien you now own goes unpaid, after x numbers of years you have the authority to foreclose on the home as a bank or other institution would. ",17

15-08-21,3hv60g,Thoughts on diversifying a Vanguard account?,"About two years ago I finally got into personal investing.  I've had company 401Ks in the past, but nothing I paid any attention to other than choosing an initial allocation percentage at first hire.  So a few years ago I did some research and started putting money into Vanguard VFIAX (I briefly started out in the ETF version for the lower minimum, but ramped up quickly and switched over the VFIAX to get the lower rates).  I've just let it sit there in VFIAX for the last few years, periodically moving a little more over from my bank account.  I'm not doing any sort of regularly scheduled dollar cost averaging.  I just move a chunk over a few times a year and mostly forget about it.

I've been thinking about diversifying the portfolio for quite a while now.  I was about to add VEXAX, which would dovetail nicely with the VFIAX I already have, but then I figured there wasn't much point, so instead I just moved the entire VFIAX chunk into VTSAX, and that's where I currently stand now.  They have the same minimum and the same expense ratio, so they seem pretty comparable in terms of prerequisites and costs.

So, I'm more diverse in that I've moved from an S&amp;P 500 fund to a full market fund, but I'm still only in one ""fund"" -- and of course I don't have any international stocks or any bonds or anything else one might consider diversification.

Is just sitting on VTSAX really any better than VFIAX (of course I already made the purchase, but nevertheless, I'm curious)?  And how might I otherwise diversify or otherwise broaden my overall investments?  Bonds seem so meager in growth that I don't quite understand the point.  I feel like I'm missing something about bonds.  What about international?  What are the reasons for and against that route?

I'm 40 (so I only got into personal investing at 38, but like I said, I've had 401Ks (and IRAs, which I guess aren't investing) since my early 20s).  I'm looking for the usual retirement window I suppose, nothing remarkably younger or older than typical.  No huge goals here other than to put my money places it'll do better than bank accounts (duh).  Obviously almost any investment would be better than a bank account but clearly I would prefer the better options instead of the worse options, all other things being equal.

Thanks.

TL;DR: invested in pure VFIAX for a few years, just moved it all to VTSAX, but otherwise curious about further diversification options.",2

15-08-21,3hv697,"Lets Look at the S&amp;P 500 Long-term &amp; the Potential for an Upcoming Bear Market","Ive been following the global markets for some time. Many indicators seem to be pointing towards a market correction, similar to that of 2000, and 2008. Here are some of my inclinations as to why:


**1.** S&amp;P 500 long term looks like this: http://imgur.com/rSrdnB9
(Compared to 2000, and 2008, we are significantly higher. This is likely directly caused by QE, and the Fed's near 0 interest rates. We peaked a full 600 points higher than the top in 2000 AND 2008)

**2.** Fed QE after 2008 crash injected a little over $3.5 TRILLION dollars into the US monetary supply. Much of this went into the banks, and then into the market. (For perspective, a trillion $ is to a million $, as a million $ is to ONE $) Visual Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tym9AhMNcP0

**3.** Oil is at $40 a barrel, last time it was here was 2009, near the bottom of the crash.

**4.** Most commodities seem to be in the shitter

**5.** China (speaks for itself)

**6.** Europe (again, speaks for itself) + their 60 Billion new Euro printed a month with their QE stimulus plan.

**7.**  Housing market is at the same levels it was in 2007. It was a bubble then..But its healthy now?? Right.


There are more reasons, but those are the main ones that come to mind. My main takeaway is that the last 6 or so years have seen nothing but up for the S&amp;P. This cannot go on forever, no matter how rosy your outlook on the future is. The only question now, is when does the market correct. To me, where we are now looks remarkably like where we were in early 2000, and 2008. 


The Fed is pushing back an interest rate hike, which was one of their main weapons in combating the 2008 crash. Now, if there is another crash, their greatest defense will be a return to QE, as lowering interest rates will no longer be an option.


What are your thoughts? Two funds I am considering are SPXS and SH for the next 12 to 24 months, depending on how things develop.

Example: At an interval of 309 days (tried to eyeball it), this holds true for a while:

* 8/21/15: $16,459.75

I have 30 years to go before retirement and I don't know which country I'll retire in, though the likely options are Japan, UK, or the US.

Questions:

* Is it premature to be thinking about this? Should I just weight my portfolio towards the US for now and rebalance towards my target currency / market as I get closer to retirement?

* If I did try to address it now, I've been considering including a larger Japan weighting in my taxed account. My thinking is that there is a 50% chance I'll be back in Japan in 3 years at which point I may seek to buy property. For that reason I'd also choose an unhedged ETF and/or possibly an unhedged Japanese REIT if I can find such a thing.

* JPY is weak right now but if it were strong I would probably be more interested in USD hedged funds. Is this sensible? Are there any established rebalancing strategies which can take advantage of currency fluctuations? E.g. switching from unhedged to hedged when JPY passes USD in the 'big mac index'?",4

Scoffing at X% is backwards thinking. By the time (if it happens) the market's 20% below all time highs, it might already be a bottom.

A market drop isn't the reason people are panicking. It's the speed at which it's dropping: fastest since 2011. Now, there's a flip side to this. The faster it drops, the faster it recovers, so stay calm (not because it's just an X% drop) but because volatility works both ways. For example, Shanghai drops 5% one day, and goes up 4% the next. In the US markets, Monday can recover 2%, and then go down 2% on Tuesday. No one can predict it, so if you make any short term moves now, you're just gambling.

As seen in many of the blue chip companies (and indexes/funds that diversify among those business) these lulls typically rebound in higher numbers. Is this a good time to put just a few thousand into one or two of these strong businesses to gain on the turnaround (and relinquish less to trading fees)?

15-08-22,3hxkci,So today I learned an important lesson concerning VIX,"From all my options experience, the intrinsic value is the current price of the stock minus the strike price of the option.

I bought VIX $15 Jan '16 calls at a premium of 3.30, when VIX was $13, and it hit 28.30 today. Yet, the premium is only worth 4.80. Shouldn't my premium be worth at the very least the intrinsic value of 28-15...$8? It costs less money right now for you to buy the options, exercise, and sell at the current price. So I really didn't understand what was going on. 

I was fucking pissed. My FAs thought I was too small change to talk to today considering the nosedive. I made the right bet at the right time, and I should be in Yachtsville, but I wasn't.

It wasn't until I learned that VIX options have futures backing them, or something like that. Doing the research now. I thought a 50% spike in the underlying stock, when it comes to an option, leads to a massive gain. 

I didn't lose money, I just didn't make as much as I thought I would considering my mid-tier options experience level. I still don't completely understand why my premium plus the strike is less than the quoted price. 

I mean, I'm $8 over the strike. Why is that not reflected in the CBOE board?

Your help in further understanding would be appreciated, fellow YOLOers.

15-08-22,3hzyil,I think I made a huge mistake by accident... I was switching my 401k investments from low risk investments to higher risk investments...!!!,"This August 10th I switched my lower risk stock investments in my 401k to higher risk stock investments.  My thought is that these investments have acted with inverse coorelation to the market and since my opinion was that the market is headed towards at least a small recession, that this would allow my investment to grow in a shrinking economy.  

ANYWAY,  Fidelitiy made the trade for me at 200% of the market value without warning me that I was about to make such a ridiculous trade.  The fact of the matter is, they don't tell you what they will trade it at...all they do is give you your total investment value...  low and behold I find out that they buy PCRIX at $7.86 per share when it was valued at $3.84 per share...this leave me in an even deeper hole because if I want to get out of this investment, Fidelity seems likely to sell this asset at 50% of what they bought it for me at...leaving me with half of my 401k...  SOMEONE please help advise what my options are!!

EDIT: I think the case is solved...they just did a reverse stock split at the same time that I purchased the fund... what threw me off is Googles prices of the stock... pictured here..they didn't normalize the value before the stock split so it looked like the prices jumped up as soon as I made the purchase...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is important to remember what led to the 2007 banking crisis which ultimately turned into a Global financial crisis. The recovery of the stock exchange in 2009 from historic lows, was effected by intervention of central banks providing unlimited backstops and liquidity guarantees as well as transferring all that toxic debt onto its own balance sheet.

While this injected trillions of dollars, this money remained on the Feds balance sheet paying banks ~2% for the deposit that was loaned at 0%.

This money never reached the real economy and the growth of the stock exchange is Central bank fueled and not organic growth.

It is now time to raise interest rates because in theory the economy has recovered.

15-08-22,3i0x7g,How to properly back out cash from stock valuation calculation?,"I've frequently heard a reference to a valuation (P/E ratio) ""after backing out the cash."" How specifically do the mechanics of these calculations work? I gather that some per share number quantifying the cash should be subtracted from the share price. However, many companies seem to store a large chunk of the cash in short and medium-term assets not included in ""Cash and Cash Equivalents"" on the Balance Sheet. Should just the ""Cash and Cash Equivalent"" from the Balance Sheet be subtracted out, or should the entire Shareholders' Equity per share (Book Value per share). For some companies this makes a big difference. For the sake of discussion, let's say a company has a share price of $100, earnings of $5/share, Cash and Cash Equivalents of $20/share, total Shareholders' Equity (Book Value/Share) of $50/share. This puts the basic P/E ratio at 20x. The P/E ratio after backing out Cash and Cash Equivalents is 16x (($100-20)/$5). The P/E ratio after backing out total Shareholders' Equity is 10x (($100-50)/$5). A 10x P/E ratio seems pretty cheap based on conventional wisdom, so which is the proper number to use for this technique?",3

15-08-23,3i132o,(Serious) For active traders with over 1 year of experience.....tax question.,"I started trading in feb of this year. I am fortunate enough to have done really well. My problem however, is that I have never made this much money in a year and I am concerned about crossing a line and actually getting myself into a higher tax bracket than I want to be in for the year.

Im obviously going to speak to an accountant before the year is over to make sure but I really need a general idea from someone who has filed as a trader before (NOT an investor, all of my trades, every single one.....qualifies as a trade even by IRS standards).

The way I understand it. The tax for short term is 35%, however, if trading is your sole source of income (and it is mine, i said fuck working).....you are ultimately taxed the same as you would be at any other job based on your amount of income. So theoretically, if you made a pittance of 15k that year, it stands to reason that you would get all of that back come tax time.

My question is, where is the line where you make too much to get any of your taxes back? Say for example, i made 80k but it actually lost me more money than staying at 75k due to the extra taxes. Is there a number here where once you suprass it, you dont get it all back? Where is the line where you get none of it back?

If i make too much, ill talk to an account first to make sure its kosher......I'm considering yoloing something high risk, like 5-10 grand into a weekly option that i think may be a home run. If i lose the bet, I win because it would be more profitable on taxes.....if I hit a homerun, hopefully the winnings actually cover the taxes.

The market does go in cycles and while it's hard to predict when the next downturn happens you can buy insurance for your portfolio starting after about 6-7 years after a market bottom. 

We have insurance for our car, house, health, life... But why doesn't anyone buy insurance for their portfolio. 

Now I'm not one to say go liquidate your stocks right now... We could get a slight bounce here or maybe from 2-4% lower from here. And buying puts or insurance here is stupid as well.. I would sell though on any bounce.. 

But telling someone in cash that now is the time to buy because you can't time the market is absurd and irrational... 

It should be noted that market corrections typically take 5 years from when the market starts to go down to when it starts to go back up. 

If you're waiting on the sidelines to buy keep waiting. if the indexes sell off 40-50% BUY BUY BUY. Go look at a chart of the market in 2000, and 2008... and remember it typically takes 5 years from market highs until new highs are made.

I have $200 to invest (go ahead and laugh), with more on the way. With last week's downturn, I figure now is a ripe time for buying. After doing some research, I've decided to open a brokerage account with TradeKing.

Here's my plan:

1. Buy some low-cost stock from a well-established company that has historically paid good dividends (i.e. VZ, PPL, etc.).

2. Wait for the stock price to increase by some percentage (dependent on how much stock I purchase)

3. Sell enough shares to break even (with respect to the price paid at time of stick purchase), while maintaining ownership of at least one (I expect that this will take time).

4. With the stocks remaining, begin receiving dividends.

5. Rinse and repeat.

Does this make any sense, or am I in too deep? Again, my objective is to establish sources of residual income.

True that they are the de facto in the ""Professional"" Network game, and Job postings and providing the interface for career changes is their main source of income, unless I am missing something.

I believe $TOL is going to have a rough morning on Tuesday. How far will $TOL stock fall is the question imho. Will it be $1 or $5?

Monday could possibly see a nice jump to the upside. Considering, in the after hours friday. Toll brothers stock is up in after hours to a break even point. However, who knows what early morning monday trading will bring. if it opens up high, traders could knock it down before lunch. though, again traders could run up the stock throughout the day in expectations of a nice earnings report. 

REASONS I SEE A DOWNSIDE DROP. 

-Stock is looking for a sharp downside on the MACD, and other technical analysis.
-a bit of selling from insiders in August.
-I believe they are going to miss guidance.
-The little bump from the 10th of august is from blackrock. reporting 10.1% of shares outstanding.
-Then $TOL might delay coming out with earnings on tuesday. 

Overall, between monday thru tuesday morning.  I am expecting a 5-10% Drop. Unless, they come out with a nice earnings surpise.  Nonetheless, I still think $TOL is fairly-overally valued and the upside potential isn't that strong. Even with a surprise in the earnings.

The only problem is I suffer from a severe lack of funding, and I only have about 1000$ set aside by which I can loose. Is there any way that I can still day trade with only 1k?

The first question ties into my second question, which is on the topic of commissions and shorting. If I were to short a stock which I own, would I get charged commission on the short? I ask this question because I know that since funding is such an issue for me, it will be hard to pull a profit against the commissions which I am charged (I use TD Ameritrade btw).",1

Then there are the people writing, running, and interpreting the algorithms. There is a lucrative service contract to keep equipment repaired.

It did not stay there, as it soon went down a lot, back up a little, back down a little, up a lot, and so on and so forth.

In many situations like this where the market has gone down for a few days in a row, a common action would be to sell, sell, sell. Don't! Unless your goals are short term, things will play out if you give it time.

Consider these three points:

1. Your investment portfolio is probably a mix of all sorts of assets so there's a good chance that only some of your stocks are experiencing a short-term down trend.

2. The last 6 years have been some of the best years in history! Ever since the crash in 2008, Stocks have been on the rise and a new record for the DOW was achieved very recently meaning many people have been winning big!

3. This is Normal. The market constantly has its ups and downs as if it were a roller coaster taking you for the ultimate financial thrill ride. Usually, when the market goes down, it will go back up.

In closing, everyone should take a deep breath, pour yourself a nice drink, or eat a pint of ice cream and just remain calm. What you are experiencing is natural and will work itself out very soon. Give it some time and you will be relieved to see your portfolio is back where it was and better than ever before.

I noticed a while back it seems I'm limited to things only listed on the NYSE and of course yahoo finance (where all the data is pulled from). So in order to keep an eye on Hong Kong for instance I'm limited to an ETF. Not too shabby but where's the fun in that?

Outside the norm of tracking various companies and indices, I check US bonds, gold/silver spot (that took forever to figure out - its ""XAUUSD=X"" and ""XAGUSD=X"" respectively, dafuq yahoo?), long list of currencies, and of course the dollar index (DX-Y.NYB, how the hell I found that idk).

I trade options and my portfolio usually always has either calls in the VIX if its cheap enough or I'll buy puts if a market crash is in full swing. Even if my primary portfolio was comprised of stocks, I would always make sure that at least 5-10% of it would be in the previous mentioned instruments. 

But for the most part, reading this sub, it doesn't seem to me that many people prepare for a market downturn. Everyone here is preparing for the long term, but market crashes do happen, and when they do, even a well managed portfolio can lose a large % of its total value. By having a tail hedge, in the event of things going to shit, loses are either negated or at least slowed. Additionally, once the market bottoms out, the profit gained from the tail hedge can be used to re-invest back into the market when stocks are cheap. 

If you don't have any hedges yet, well.... volatility has exploded all-ready, so its probably a bit late until things quiet down, but when they do it may be time to re-adjust and prepare for a crash.",5

The US, with a market cap of $19.8 trillion, is the biggest and represents 52% of the world’s market cap. Japan is in second place at $3 trillion, followed by the UK at $2.7 trillion, and then France at $1.3 trillion.

Notably, Hong Kong’s market cap is nearly the same size of China (both of which are significantly smaller than countries like the US and Japan).

Meanwhile, Russia, which has a bigger surface area than Pluto, is about the same size as Finland in terms of market cap.

They claim it will be better and that fidelity is the #1 workplace investment location. Yet after looking at our offerings we gain 0 benefits from this switch, the expense ratios in each category essentially increase.

. Overall my investment portfolio consists of some individual stock aapl, dis, twx and jblu. I'm long on all of them and more consider the money in them play money but i believe in the companies and they have fundamentals that would suggest longevity. The remainder of the portfolio would be a just started vanguard IRA and brokerage. I would like the brokerage to be a mutual fund that I could invest in throughout the years whenever I had extra money that would not impact reaching the max IRA per year. Usually a 500-1k surplus each month total. Vanguard wise I was considering Wellington, balance index and a more stock heavy diversified equity. Or should I go the ETF route (i worry about rebalancing as it is a taxable account)  IRA wise I was seeking areas that I could not target else where as in REIT, healthcare and other sectors that allow be to rebalance into general funds as I go since it is an IRA. What would you suggest? The way I figure is to go with the better funds in the 401K (i put in 7% atm, 1-2% company match but company contributions come mainly through ESOP funds and are not put into the 401k) use that as my % of portfolio from that area and balance the rest with the vanguard mutual fund. Also is there anything I can do regarding the 401k, while i understand if I'm stuck with the switch and essential downgrade of most funds are there any options to switch out the funds to my IRA or complain or really anything? yes it's not a huge deal i'm more just curious since they pitch fidelity as the best which it can be but we gain none of the better benefits which I would see as access to fidelity funds and ishare funds.

The video itself was entirely a screencast of investment/brokerage charts. The video was well-executed in a single take and the audio was clear. He was very bearish on the coming week, so it was probably recorded/posted yesterday or this morning.

Two content details I remember:

1. He liked (though nevertheless cautioned against buying) MEDNAX stock (MD). He suggested that MD is hanging in there despite the market headwinds.

2. He derided an anonymous guy on Twitter who bragged about paring back to 10% cash over the last few days. The vlogger said that was like bragging about ""having a Maserati when all you really own of one is the steering wheel.""

15-08-23,3i4zac,"Why is there so much doubt revolving around Netflix &amp; Facebook if a downturn were to happen compared to the 'Media/entertainment Bluechips'","I've never been one to ride the Netflix or Facebook circle jerk bus that seems to leave the station on a daily basis here on r/investing. However, I have seen an overwhelming sense of fear regarding these two particular companies within our community in the event of a bear market taking hold. Can someone explain to me what will fundamentally change regarding these two companies if the market heads towards another recession?


Literally every single person I know that has faced a tight budget has opted to keep their $7.95 a month Netflix account over their $45-$150 a month cable/Direct TV account. In a bear market it seems Netflix would actually be the more favorable play over the traditional Bluechip media/cable companies. I understand these other companies are much more diversified than Netflix in terms of their revenue streams, but I don't see the core income model of Netflix taking any sort of hit regarding monthly subscribers if the economy turns sour.


Facebook is a slightly different animal as they rely on income from their advertisers and a bad economy means less money spent on marketing from companies of all sizes. However, it has been proven that media &amp; entertainment stocks are actually favorable plays during bear markets. I don't have the report on hand but I actually read a short list of what the average consumer spends a % of their time &amp; money on during a recession vs. during a growing economy. Shockingly, one of the things consumers actually spent more time &amp; money on was personal entertainment. The psychological idea being that people surround themselves with distractions to take their minds off the negatives of their financial situation rather than cutting back on the time/money spent on these 'fun/entertaining' things. It would seem from the outside looking in they would cut back on these types of activities, but that isn't the case. Not to mention FB is free to use, if anything average time users spend on the site will increase.


Maybe the reason we are seeing these two stocks as being the center of the 'don't touch these during a downturn' is because they are two of the biggest faces of the tech bubble 2.0. I completely agree with the mentality of being very wary of other, much less established tech plays, but Netflix and FB are way past the point of being boom and bust bubble stocks. In my opinion they are now staples of our daily lives/economy just as much as any other Large Cap stock.",68

This seems to be what I'm after but I've never messed with anything like this, would like to know what other people think:

https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0045&amp;FundIntExt=INT

Vanguard money-market fund that sits in high-quality securities with a term shorter than 380 days. Assets held start on page 12 of the attached prospectus summary, mostly municipality stuff.

Is there anything bad about just holding cash in a bank account? Is it any better/worse than sitting in a money market account denominated in t-bills and other short term securities? I don't wanna get to tinfoil-hattish here, but Greeks did have a portion of their accounts confiscated. Just wondering what the risks in that could be. Yes, what I'm describing is a defcon-5 situation and unlikely to happen, but it should still be made aware of.

Apparently the sentiment is, if the reigning central banking structure does start to crumble (as it was about to in the '08 panic), everyone's going to flee into the $USD (global reserve currency) for safety, triggering deflation. So sitting in $USD isn't a bad idea short-term, once the panic wears off all that $USD will seep into more speculative assets and inflation takes over. So if things really start turning south we've got maybe 6mo/1yr to move from cash/cash-like assets to long term investments at bargain prices. Anyone have any thoughts on this?

15-08-24,3i88bg,What % increase in individual stocks will be greater than an employer based retirement like nationwide?,"Im trying to figure out if i can make more money investing in stocks myself versus what a contribution to a mutual fund would net.

Mutual funds, even 'higher risk' or stocks - have not done more than a few %...and they take out a management fee in my nationwide/NACO acct.  On the plus side, its pre-tax, no buy/sell fees.

Individual stocks, i seem to be doing well in.  In the few stocks i do own, i was up 18% before last week.  Im confident they will rebound, but what was vexing me was whether or not gaining 18% was better than say, 3% in NACO.  Capital gains will eat some, and im taxed at the time it is earned.

Im in the 28% federal tax bracket, and state is 5%.  I found a calculator that says if i buy for $10k and sell for $11.8k, my taxes due are $360....plus ive already been taxed in my regular salary...which is exactly 20%

When i withdraw a retirement or supplemental retirement, are capital gains taken from me at that point?

15-08-24,3i57gp,"Understanding Amex's Business Segments and Competitive Advantages","I'm in the midst of reading through Amex's 10K and am better trying to get a sense of what the revenue drivers of each business segment are and their competitive advantages.

Can someone give me a gut check to make sure my understanding Amex is correct and what other factors I'm not considering? 

**U.S. Card Services – USCS**

* $16.5B in revenue
* $3.2B in profit
* Primary Revenues: Amex makes the bulk their the money from this segment (~50%) via discount fees on US-based merchants (i.e. fees that are charged per swipe, which tend to be higher than Visa and MC because Amex cardholders tend to spend much more per transaction due to their generally higher affluence). Other sources of revenue from this segment are annual card fees, interest on card balances, travel commissions, and loans to card holders. 
* Primary Expenses: Marketing/promotion/advertising, rewards (MR redemption), Co-Brand Fees (e.g. payment to Starwood for SPG card) 

**International Card Services – ICS**

* $5.1B in Revenue
* $.41B in profit
* Primary Revenues: Amex makes the bulk of the money from this segment via discount fees on non-US-based merchants (i.e. fees that are charged per swipe, which tend to be higher than Visa and MC because Amex cardholders tend to spend much more per transaction due to their generally higher affluence). Other sources of revenue from this segment are annual card fees, interest on card balances, travel commissions, and loans to card holders. 
* Primary Expenses: Marketing/promotion/advertising, rewards (MR redemption), Co-Brand Fees.

**Global Commercial Services – GCS**

* $4.768B in Revenue
* $1.534B in profit
* Primary Revenues: Most of the money is generated from corporate payment services to large and mid-tier businesses such as expenses management. How does this work though? Does Amex charge a large company x% of spend to manage their expenses? Flat-fee? Or is Amex simply breaking out the discount revenue from merchants derived from corporate cards? If so, why is the profit margin so high in this segment? 
* Primary Expenses: Marketing/promotion/advertising, and rewards (MR redemption).

**Global Network and Merchant Services – GNS**

* $5.64 in Revenue
* $1.66B in profit
* Primary Revenues: Point of sale products, financing, and other services to merchants. Additionally, this segment also includes revenue derived from partnership agreements with 3rd party card issuers. For example, Santander Bank might issue an Amex-branded card internationally, and would pay Amex licensing fees to use their network and brand. 
* Primary Expenses: Marketing/promotion/advertising and card member services. 


**Questions**

* Where does the loss of Costco hurt them? Surely USCS, but I feel the market is overestimating the true cost. What else does Amex get from this other than 100% of the discount fees from Costco? Also, wouldn't any decline in revenue be partially offset by a drop in Cobrand-related expenses? 
* What does a merchant really get out accepting Amex? I've seen that Amex cardholders charge on average 2x that of other cardholders. However, I still have trouble grasping if this makes makes it worth it for a merchant because despite personally being a fiercely loyal Amex cardholder, if a merchant tells me that they don't accept Amex, I don't really have much of a problem giving them my Visa card instead. Additionally, I'm not going to tell them after I've been rung up to reduce my total bill by 50% because I can't put it on an Amex. Just doesn't seem like a merchant would really lose that much more business by choosing not to accept Amex. 
* Are discount revenues a part of each business segment? Or is it just USCS and ICS? ",1

I have to watch my money plummet, minute by minute.

-5.61% so far.

EDIT:

-6.77% OK enough, you can stop now. Go back up please.

EDIT 3:

-7.91% THIS IS JUST INSANE HOW THE FUCK CAN AN INDEX PLUMMET 8% IN A DAY ESPECIALLY AFTER LOSING 33% IN LIKE 3 MONTHS WTF IS GOING ON

EDIT 4:

-8.02% I can't take this shit anymore. I just keep refreshing and I am in total disbelief. What an utter fucking scam. Fuck that, fuck that and fuck that.

EDIT 5:

-8.36%... I didn't even think such large one-day drops were possible. What the fuck! How is that even possible? We know China is slowing down a little, but not by 8 fucking percent! I bought YINN at $20.72, how much trouble am I in?? I can'T even see because the market isnt fucking open but if i could i would sell my yinn right now and go full yang. this must mean its going back up

EDIT 6:

-8.45% Looks like we finally hit a bottom. I lost 25% of my investment on YINN. To say that I spent all week-end feeling terrible for not buying more YINN. This is some fucked up shit.

But at this level (semi-stable), I would certainly add to my YINN position. I would double down. I think we are going back up, perhaps -5% for the day.

EDIT 7:

Looks like I called the bottom 100%. What do you think YINN will open at tomorrow? $16?$17? Maybe I can keep my loss beneath 20%. 20% in a fucking week-end.

EDIT8 : WHAT THE FUCK THIS ISNT OVER -8.56% THE SELLOFF IS RESUMING HOLY FUCKING SHIT THE BREAK CANT COME TOO SOON

I am most likely averaging down on YINN tomorrow. There is no way this one can keep dropping. Just no way at all.

EDIT 9: Can't sleep. At least it has stopped dropping. It has been ridiculously stable at -8.45% for the last hour or so. Will stay online watching it until 9:30AM tomorrow morning.

How It Will Happen:

Hey all, I've been a lurker here for about 3 months and have grown to like this thread.  Being such, I'd rather not see the yolos die from getting caught in a bear.  So I'm offering my advice on how the next market correction will play out, and hopefully allow you guys the ability to get those moonyachts.  If you believe my predictions suck and that I'm a hack, ignore them; I could care less. If it helps you and you get an yolo idea, all the better.

Since February, the S&amp;P has been stuck between 2040 and 2140, waiting for a breakout.  When a market trades is such a small range, when it does finally break resistance, it breaks with size.  Imagine a bottle of champagne getting shaken; when the resistance in form of the cork goes, its almost impossible to get it to stop in the short term (1 to 2 weeks).  If stocks start to go down, fear is going to keep on continuing to pile up in the markets, which means bad news for high yield bonds and equities.  

Now lets say stocks drop 10 to 15 percent. Woop. Te. Doo.  Doesn't really mean too much.  Stocks are an extremely liquid asset, so people entering and exiting doesn't pose any sort of major risk, other than a flash flood coming from the tears of  r/investing and r/stocks.  Junk bonds, on the other hand, are about as liquid as a boulder; they are rarely traded a , so selling a bond in a secondary market usually means you will have to take a nice haircut.  Your average mom and pop likely doesn't have the acumen nor the risk tolerance to stay in an illiquid asset when it is going down, and if risk creeps up, many will look to exit their positions.

But if mom and pop are exiting their junks, who is going to buy?  Hedge funds?  Fat chance; a lot of the smart money, especially Carl Icahn, have already admitted that they are short junks and are looking to make a killing from these guys running into trouble. Other mom and pops?  Fear just hit, no way they are getting in.  The issuers of the ETF? They are having enough problems finding cash to pay those leaving the fund.  They can attempt to sell their bonds, but it takes time to find a buyer, especially one that won't be demanding a huge haircut from a seller they know is having liquidity problems.  Banks? With the implementation of the Volcker rule, they legally cant do that.  So if there is no one willing to buy the asset, what happens to the value of the asset? Simple; it tanks. So then what happens?  The ETF has to then sell its junk bonds in order to provide cash for those leaving their fund, but since junk bonds aren't liquid, they have to sell those bonds at a discount, lowering the value of the fund, and causing more panic as people see their portfolio drop.  The negative reinforcement cycle is complete. 

Now, you will be looking at the market with your shorts, and it will be like 2008. There will be big moves down, followed by somewhat smaller moves up, with bigger moves down following that.  People will be scared, but they will become a small bit more used to the volatility.  But when one of the big two junk ETFs (HYG and JNK) fails, then everyone will lose their mind. This could be your 7 to 8 percent drop day when you see this happen, and will only cause the junks to freeze up more. The Federal Reserve will then commit to not raising rates for the rest of the year or for a further 6 months, but the damage has already been done.  

The Possible Yolos:

Here are some trades that you could do to take advantage of this in order of most risky to least risky
- HYG Dec/Jan puts - If you short these funds and they fail, you win. I prefer HYG as you will pay a smaller amount on fees than with JNK.
- Momentum stock puts - the guys like AMZN, FB, TSLA, NFLX
- Short momentum stocks - same guys as above, just without leverage
- Short indexes - Nasdaq historically has bigger pullbacks in corrections than the S&amp;P and DJIA, so favor QQQ inverses
- Long treasuries - I would go midyear treasuries (5-10 yr notes), but all treasuries should fare well

Penny Stocks, Long Term Stocks, Several Transactions a Day.

All of the Banks here seem to have a similar platform, and a $9.99 Commission per trade.

I'm currently with RBC for my Banking, But I'm a little lost as to how to proceed.

I've been bank to bank but they are all so robotic in their responses, nobody seems to know anything about penny stocks or actually MAKING MONEY on the stock market, they are all long term investments, TFSA's Ect.

All I want to do is dump 10k in, make or lose some money, withdraw, dump more in, rinse repeat.

1) Is $9.99 per Trade Expensive for Penny Stocks? 
( I was hoping to Make $100 - $500 a day Trading Penny's )
Have about 10k to play with.

2) Any Prefered Bank or Platform? Or Should I be looking at a 3rd party Company and linking my Bank account to them?

Thanks Guys,

VIX is at 35 right now. VIX never lasts long above 20. Unless you think the sky is failling (hint: it isn't), shorting VXX is a no brainer. It decays by a fucking 10% per month! This means that with VXX at $25 today, even if things dont move, it will be at $22.50 next month. Wow!

15-08-24,3i8q0f,Investing in Germany/USA... Where to even begin?,"Firstly, let me say that I have no experience or knowledge of investing, and I apologize for my ignorance.

I also don’t know if I’m posting in the right place – please tell me if I should move this elsewhere.

I am 27 years old in the US, self employed, and have no retirement account or investments. All of my savings are in my bank, which returns practically nothing on my savings account. I know I should be investing in the market, but there are so many different options that when I research I end up ‘turning off’.

To make matters more confusing, my husband is German (living in Germany) and we plan on moving back and forth between the US and Germany over the years, leaving us vulnerable to currency conversion problems. For example, we are planning to buy a house in Germany in the next few years, but all of our savings are in dollars – converting is very expensive.

We want to ‘invest in the whole market’ in Germany and in the USA. We’re thinking 5 grand in each to start. I don’t know what type of investment that is – a mutual fund? An index? I want something I can put money into and then ignore for years. No individual trading every day, or picking individual companies for me.

Anyhow, I know that I can buy a &lt;insert appropriate investment thing&gt; for the US Market from a US company like ETRADE here. But, should I/can I/do I have to buy the same type of &lt;insert appropriate investment thing&gt; for the German market from the same US company like ETRADE here (using dollars)? Or should I/can I/do I have to buy that &lt;investment thing&gt; from, say, my husband’s bank in Germany (using Euros)? Investing in the European market with dollars seems... counterproductive.

Can someone give me a gut check to make sure my understanding Amex is correct and what other factors I'm not considering? 

**U.S. Card Services – USCS**

* $16.5B in revenue
* $3.2B in profit
* Primary Revenues: Amex makes the bulk their the money from this segment (~50%) via discount fees on US-based merchants (i.e. fees that are charged per swipe, which tend to be higher than Visa and MC because Amex cardholders tend to spend much more per transaction due to their generally higher affluence). Other sources of revenue from this segment are annual card fees, interest on card balances, travel commissions, and loans to card holders. 
* Primary Expenses: Marketing/promotion/advertising, rewards (MR redemption), Co-Brand Fees (e.g. payment to Starwood for SPG card) 

**International Card Services – ICS**

* $5.1B in Revenue
* $.41B in profit
* Primary Revenues: Amex makes the bulk of the money from this segment via discount fees on non-US-based merchants (i.e. fees that are charged per swipe, which tend to be higher than Visa and MC because Amex cardholders tend to spend much more per transaction due to their generally higher affluence). Other sources of revenue from this segment are annual card fees, interest on card balances, travel commissions, and loans to card holders. 
* Primary Expenses: Marketing/promotion/advertising, rewards (MR redemption), Co-Brand Fees.

**Global Commercial Services – GCS**

* $4.768B in Revenue
* $1.534B in profit
* Primary Revenues: Most of the money is generated from corporate payment services to large and mid-tier businesses such as expenses management. How does this work though? Does Amex charge a large company x% of spend to manage their expenses? Flat-fee? Or is Amex simply breaking out the discount revenue from merchants derived from corporate cards? If so, why is the profit margin so high in this segment? 
* Primary Expenses: Marketing/promotion/advertising, and rewards (MR redemption).

**Global Network and Merchant Services – GNS**

* $5.64 in Revenue
* $1.66B in profit
* Primary Revenues: Point of sale products, financing, and other services to merchants. Additionally, this segment also includes revenue derived from partnership agreements with 3rd party card issuers. For example, Santander Bank might issue an Amex-branded card internationally, and would pay Amex licensing fees to use their network and brand. 
* Primary Expenses: Marketing/promotion/advertising and card member services. 


**Questions**

* Where does the loss of Costco hurt them? Surely USCS, but I feel the market is overestimating the true cost. What else does Amex get from this other than 100% of the discount fees from Costco? Also, wouldn't any decline in revenue be partially offset by a drop in Cobrand-related expenses? 
* What does a merchant really get out accepting Amex? I've seen that Amex cardholders charge on average 2x that of other cardholders. However, I still have trouble grasping if this makes makes it worth it for a merchant. Despite personally being a loyal Amex cardholder, if a merchant tells me that they don't accept Amex, I don't really have much of a problem giving them my Visa card instead. Additionally, I'm not going to tell them after I've been rung up to reduce my total bill just because I can't put it on an Amex. Just doesn't seem like a merchant would really lose that much more business by choosing not to accept Amex. 
* Are discount revenues a part of each business segment? Or is it just USCS and ICS? ",1

15-08-24,3i8r6n,Investor Underground - Not idea for new trader,"This review is my honest  and scrutinized  opinion.,unbiased .I was a member of IU for 2 months .I am trading about 2 years now .Cant say very successful But consistent .I have tried different newsletters - like Tim's Penny silver . i heard a lot about IU so thought to give a try .Then i joined and was there for 2 months .

First of all , $197 p/m for IU standard  is pricey .Their aim to advertise to make this community for both new traders and experience traders .so most of the traders (newbie) who takes  good amount of time to be make money ,$197 a month is definitely expensive for them also if you add software fees , L2 ,brokers fess etc.

Secondly there are no alert from nate and other moderators .I know alert service is not good to be blindly followed but it is definitely  helpful to understand the trade plan to be educated and to support ( from a pro trader) your trade idea on a particular stock ( if you already have before alert) 

It is for sure that IU is a great community for all pro traders But most of them (95 % ) do not participate any ideas ,discussion , watch list ,trade plan in the chatroom . Which is more annoying is that most of them do not response to you if you ask some trade related Q or any other kind of advise You feel like a dickhead and left alone! They are already successful so why they have to care about you !They will discussing ideas among good friends – Nate,modern rock ,d4ytrad3,elkwood etc. But i assumed that as it is a paid chatroom ( specially $197 pm ) so I expected more than nate's watchlist !

Thirdly you have to be very careful ( newbie ) when asking Q because IU love to Gag ppl .Most of the ppl in the chatroom do not ask nonsense questions but also for some funny reason IU moderator are very sensitive .It is rather a chatroom for elite pro traders with their alien discussion ( terms / phrase difficult to understand for new trader ) than a free discussion of trade plan which actually can be useful in a day trade making some real money than showing off who is more knowledgeable and smart !!!

Fourth Nate hardly trade stocks between $1 - $5 , Most of his trades based on over $10 – $100  ,which is not convenient for small accounts ( I think most of the start-up traders have small account )No one can grow a small account with a high price stock because most of your money involved in one high price stock trade !

Fifth Nate and other traders do not mention their entry exit , profit ,loss etc in the chatroom .So you are blindly following a GURU not knowing what is his activity .I think it is very important to get motivated if you know how is your Guru performing.

Overall it is a great community for Pro trader if you want to make friends , share trade ideas and praise among themselves  But definitely confusing and not useful for New trader because I believe with learning curve someone need to make some money while trading otherwise it is like being smart ass with no real work.

I am sure Nate is a great person and trader I like him for his humble attitude But also he needs to understand to run a paid service ,services need to be actually there .That chat room need some changes like other available chartrooms -  alert , trade plan ,low price stocks , giving priority to every paid members not only friends etc. Then I am sure it will the best chartrooms among others .

I hope Nate read this and do something about it .if changes comes I will be the first to join IU again .

Believe me: the market WILL recover. Maybe not this week, maybe not this month and maybe not even this year, but it WILL recover and stocks WILL trade back at a price much higher than the price today.

Personally, I have grabbed AAPL and DIS today. I am looking to add some senior housing, Potash and perhaps some NFLX tomorrow.",5

15-08-24,3i8t92,Investor Underground Not Ideal for New Trader,"This review is my honest  and scrutinized  opinion.,unbiased .I was a member of IU for 2 months .I am trading about 2 years now .Cant say very successful But consistent .I have tried different newsletters - like Tim's Penny silver . i heard a lot about IU so thought to give a try .Then i joined and was there for 2 months .

First of all , $197 p/m for IU standard  is pricey .Their aim to advertise to make this community for both new traders and experience traders .so most of the traders (newbie) who takes  good amount of time to be make money ,$197 a month is definitely expensive for them also if you add software fees , L2 ,brokers fess etc.

Secondly there are no alert from nate and other moderators .I know alert service is not good to be blindly followed but it is definitely  helpful to understand the trade plan to be educated and to support ( from a pro trader) your trade idea on a particular stock ( if you already have before alert) 

It is for sure that IU is a great community for all pro traders But most of them (95 % ) do not participate any ideas ,discussion , watch list ,trade plan in the chatroom . Which is more annoying is that most of them do not response to you if you ask some trade related Q or any other kind of advise You feel like a dickhead and left alone! They are already successful so why they have to care about you !They will discussing ideas among good friends – Nate,modern rock ,d4ytrad3,elkwood etc. But i assumed that as it is a paid chatroom ( specially $197 pm ) so I expected more than nate's watchlist !

Thirdly you have to be very careful ( newbie ) when asking Q because IU love to Gag ppl .Most of the ppl in the chatroom do not ask nonsense questions but also for some funny reason IU moderator are very sensitive .It is rather a chatroom for elite pro traders with their alien discussion ( terms / phrase difficult to understand for new trader ) than a free discussion of trade plan which actually can be useful in a day trade making some real money than showing off who is more knowledgeable and smart !!!

Fourth Nate hardly trade stocks between $1 - $5 , Most of his trades based on over $10 – $100  ,which is not convenient for small accounts ( I think most of the start-up traders have small account )No one can grow a small account with a high price stock because most of your money involved in one high price stock trade !

Fifth Nate and other traders do not mention their entry exit , profit ,loss etc in the chatroom .So you are blindly following a GURU not knowing what is his activity .I think it is very important to get motivated if you know how is your Guru performing.

Overall it is a great community for Pro trader if you want to make friends , share trade ideas and praise among themselves  But definitely confusing and not useful for New trader because I believe with learning curve someone need to make some money while trading otherwise it is like being smart ass with no real work.

I am sure Nate is a great person and trader I like him for his humble attitude But also he needs to understand to run a paid service ,services need to be actually there .That chat room need some changes like other available chartrooms -  alert , trade plan ,low price stocks , giving priority to every paid members not only friends etc. Then I am sure it will the best chartrooms among others .

I hope Nate read this and do something about it .if changes comes I will be the first to join IU again .

**Oil**

I stumbled across this nugget last week...

http://www.thestreet.com/story/13257692/1/energy-downturn-creates-opportunities-for-texas-bank-cullenfrost.html?puc=yahoo&amp;cm_ven=YAHOO

40 year CEO of a Houston bank doubling down on oil/gas loans?  And the idea of a September rate hike to help out the banks is probably out the window.  IKBC, FNBC, ZION, and CMA are other TX/LA based banks that are worth taking a look at as well.  They all suffered mightily this past week, but may have more to come.

SEC rule on reserve reporting...

https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2008/33-8995.pdf

&gt; In order to provide disclosures which are more consistent with the objective of comparability, the amendments state that the existing economic conditions for determining the economic producibility of oil and gas reserves include the 12-month
average price, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period. For example, a company with a reporting year end of December 31 would
determine its reserves estimates for its annual report based on the average of the prices for oil or gas on the first day of every month from January through December. Therefore, the use of a 12-month average price provides companies with the ability to efficiently
prepare useful reserve information without sacrificing the objective of comparability. We believe that the revised definition of the term “proved oil and gas reserves” will provide investors with improved reserves information thereby enhancing their ability to analyze
the disclosures. 

And an Ernst/Young study on reserve prices...

http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-us-oil-and-gas-reserves-study-2015/$FILE/EY-us-oil-and-gas-reserves-study-2015.pdf

Monthly spot prices historically...

https://ycharts.com/indicators/average_crude_oil_spot_price

Now, simple math tells us that current oil reserves therefore are priced at 80 dollars a barrel, the average price for all of the months of 2014.

Here's the XOM report from December 2013 as an example, ctrl-f for reserves...

http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/34088/000003408814000012/xom10k2013.htm

From all of this data it shouldn't be too hard to pin a number on where oil winds up.  If it hangs on to 40, XLE in the 50s.  If it falls to the 30s (or 20s, or whatever), average the price for the year.

Sort for a year.

Retail ETFs have no reason to suffer, really, at this point.  The US economy is fine and gas is cheaper, coming into Christmas shopping season.  In a correction utilities perform best historically, and with rate hikes looking less and less likely, utilities are probably short term safe-havens, don't be surprised to see them recover quickly as of the first dead-cat bounce in all of this.  If you wanna be long something...

There's also no reason for health care stocks to suffer with the rest, so if they are dragged down by the rest then they're probably a solid bet for any sort of rebound.  Pfizer is a prime example, they just revised their estimates for the year upward a couple weeks ago.

Who hasn't suffered enough?  Banks.  They've been creeping up for the past few months based on positive housing sales, a resolution to sort out Greece coupled with Euro QE, and the anticipation of a rate hike this year from the Fed.  If the rate hike is out the window, there's no good news that I can see for the big 4 banks (BAC, JPM, C, WFC).  They're all still well above their YTD lows, while the rest of the market is in the red for the year.  JPM in particularly is well above its YTD low.

If any sector has more to lose, it's anything that could be called a bank, imo, because of the dwindling odds of a Fed rate hike considering the market circumstances.

The catch in all of this is how to get short cheaply?  Put premiums are gonna be fierce.  If you're gonna be all cash anyways, calendar put spreads are probably decent lotto tickets.  If the timing works out right they'll potentially be huge winners.  if the timing is off they'll make a little profit or a little loss on the short expiration, but nothing major either way.  That's my best idea for tomorrow.  I'll be shopping for decent calendar put spread prices on regional and national banks.

It should be noted that if you do not have margin on your account and think you can play with puts in this market with single leg options, you are playing with fucking fire.  It just can't work with the volatilities so high.

Obviously it is he who sets the price of diamonds, both polished and (indirectly) rough. He is the one who decides if a diamond ought to be offered at a certain price, or if he even wants a diamond at all. Every supply chain is supposed to work according to this assumption. When the consumer decides that he wants, and is able, to pay the nominal price for a given diamond, he simultaneously sets the price of that diamond. This in turn determines the price of the rough diamond (from which the polished diamond was produced). The difference in these two prices is the total gross profit of of the supply chain: the miners, the polishers, the setters, and the merchants.

15-08-24,3i6dhq,An Introduction to Contrarian Investing,"In the last post we just concluded our Trend Following series. Now, we’re going to cover a new investment strategy that has worked exceptionally well across various markets (stocks, commodities, currencies) since the 2008 market crash. This strategy is known as Contrarian Investing. Contrarian Investing is exactly what it sounds like – if everyone else is selling and the market crashes, you should buy into the market. If everyone else is buying and the market spikes, you should sell the market. Contrarian investing is based on a simple tenet: the crowd (when it moves in one distinct direction) is always wrong.

Obviously, this belief is not 100% true. What makes Contrarian Investing truly successful is that this investment strategy rests on a simple fact of the universe: mean reversion. When things go to one extreme, they will reverse towards the mean and go the other way. This also aligns itself with the concept of cycles. The whole universe travels in cycles. If the economy goes to hell (deviates from the mean), sooner or later this bad cycle will end and the economy will rise (mean reversion).

Similarly, when the market moves extremely quickly in one direction (e.g. a sharp sell off or a spike in the market), contrarian investing states that the market will rebound to the other direction.

When to Buy and When to Sell
That being said, when everyone else is buying, contrarian investing says that you should sell. When everyone else is selling, contrarian investing says that you should buy.

However, the critical question here is: how do you define “everyone else is buying / selling?” How do you quantify the strenght of a market sell off or a market strength? After all, only when you quantify something can you make objective, unbiased investment decisions. Extremes are known as Oversold and Overbought. When the market is Oversold (very intense market selloff), it’s time to buy. When the market is Overbought (very intense spike), it’s time to sell. To quantify Oversold and Overbought, we have 3 techniques.

Oscillator Technical Indicators
Previously we have already discussed the definition of technical indicators. There is a specific type of technical indicators for contrarian investing called oscillators. Oscillators oscillate (waiver) around a mean line (average). When an oscillator reaches an extreme, a BUY/SELL signal is generated. When the Oscillator rises above a pre-determined number (e.g. 80), the market is considered to be Overbought. Thus, it’s time to sell. When the Oscillator falls below a pre-determined number (e.g. 20), the market is considered t obe Oversold. Thus, it’s time to buy. There are many types of Oscillators, but they all generate similar signals at similar times. Below is an example of an oscillator:

 

 An Introduction to Contrarian Investing
Credit
The above picture shows RSI (Relative Strenght Index) below the market price. Like all technical indicators, Oscillators such as RSI only use the market’s close price. In the above case, the predetermined “Overbought” level was 70 and the predetermined “Oversold” level was 30. What your predetermined level will be is up to your discretion.

Using Extreme Time
As the saying goes (which is a pretty big cliche), “history repeats itself”. Contrarian investors and traders use time as a measurement for “how extreme is the current sell off / spike in the market?” If the current sell off / spike extends beyond any historical precedent, then this is a really EXTREME situation, and the market should reverse to its mean (go the other way) any moment now. Here’s an example.

Let’s say that in the past 13 years, the U.S. stock market index S&amp;P500 has never fallen for 10 days in a row. That right there is a historical fact. If the market right now has fallen for 9 days in a row already, what are the odds that the market will spike? Considering that the market has never fallen more than 10 days, the odds of the market spiking is insanely high!.

Using Extreme Magnitude
Like using Extreme Time, using Extreme Magnitude also depends on history. If the current sell off / spike extends beyond historical precedent in terms of magnitude (what % has the market fallen/risen), then the odds of a market turn around are high. Here’s an example.

It would be helpful to me if companies contextualized price movements based on their company's own account of recent events.  
  
It would be even more helpful if I could compare the company's own accounts against the analysis of disinterested observers. It would be nice to be able to highlight a certain portion of the stock's recent history and have the cause for this particular rise or fall explained in layman's terms (Share price fell after the company was sued. Share price rose when they were granted a patent or made a mineral discovery)
  
Maybe it's a silly question and the reasons for stock movements are too complicated to map neatly as distilled soundbytes. Then again, there seem certain circumstances wherein the movement for a precipitous decline or ascent is evident. ",0

They submitted an NDA last December, so the FDA has to give a yes or no at or before the end of this October. 

Buprenorphine is a Schedule III opioid derivative and generally well received compared to similar Schedule II narcotics. BDSI already has an FDA approved drug containing such, which only strengthens BELBUCA's potential for approval. 

However, I'm going to straddle this play for two reasons. 

1. Every time I think I don't need to hedge my positions because they're low risk or small, my ass gets burned off. Don't be stupid like me. Hedge everything. Hedge your dick if you can. 

2. I've seen promising drugs get deferred by the FDA just because they want another clinical trial for some fringe case. This is a good thing because the FDA doesn't fool around. But it can really mess with a company's valuation. Even though generally in these cases the drug will get approved after Phase 4 trials, hype is a fickle thing. 

Calls and puts for September and December all day everyday. The PDUFA date is October 22nd, but technically the FDA could release their decision earlier, which would spike the fuck out of current September calls.

Could it be that when the head of a large hedge fund falsely compared SolarCity to a subprime leasing scheme that investors realized that it was indeed a good place to weather this storm? 

SolarCity's business model doesn't plan on making any money in the near term anyways, they are counting on accumulative revenue streams in the next fews to build up along side massive US factory expansions.   The accumulative streams are long term contracts providing solar energy for a cost than is less than people would normally buy through their current electricity providers.   The business model becomes even more attractive in a recession as it brings savings to its consumers.

1. You had 10k invested, and now it's worth 8k. You sell it and now have harvest a 2k loss for future gains. You invest that 8k into something else and it goes up to 10k. The tax losses balance out the gains and you would not be taxed (if you were to sell). Net zero. 

2. You had 10k invested and now it's worth 8k. You hold the course and it eventually goes back up to 10k. If you were to sell you would have 0 gains and not be taxed. Net zero.

So, my question. When using a brokerage firm, such as Merill Lynch, if I only currently own a handful  of shares, say 100 or a company and the dividend is $0.14 ($14).

15-08-25,3i9opz,To our new visitors and subscribers,"These past few days in the market, especially today, have brought far more traffic and subscribers than usual, presumably people looking for answers and help. As such, you all may be looking for a place to start and find comprehensive information about the market as it pertains to your portfolio.

[We have a wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) that highlights the basics of investing and links to respected websites (namely Investopedia and Khan Academy) where you can learn the finer details of investing. 

I'm sure the biggest question everyone has is ""can the market keep going down?"" The answer is, frankly: absolutely.

However, the important thing to remember about the market is that companies are constantly growing, expanding, replacing failing companies, introducing new competition, etc. This is what causes the markets to rise. A portfolio with a long horizon *can* withstand corrections and crashes without any unusual or irregular interference because of the natural growth of the markets. 

As such, if you are a novice investor with a long ways until retirement, there is no reason to panic and spontaneously liquidate a portfolio. Obviously, advice may be different for traders or people looking to capitalize on all price movements. But for most people just looking to build wealth into retirement without much active management, steadfastness will suffice.

That said, there may be special cases such as people in retirement of the age 70+ whose portfolios cannot withstand significant drawdown when you need that money the most. In situations such as these, it would be best to meet with a qualified advisor to explore your options. For everyone else, continuing as normal without panic is almost always the best option.",20

There isn't time to blankly stare at the screen for hours as if you were waiting for the resistance in your mouse's left click button to fail and ""accidentally"" click the buy button. **There is no such thing as a crash that cannot be rationalized**.

If you can't sleep at night, go sell 20% now, 10% per day until you can sleep at night... or just realize you are only down 10-15%.

If you want to cash out - many people tentatively wanted to cash out at the top. Read... everyone does it at the exact same time so the market naturally gets oversold. There will be rebounds the price points above where the market is now. **Sell then instead**.

If your strategy is long term buy and hold, go buy some VTI and **HODL ON!**

A 10-15% price swing and everyone goes crazy. Come on lol that is sad. There were investment opportunities last year, there are investment opportunities now... *there are always investment opportunities*. (Aren't you glad that's not bolded?)

If you want some diversification, may I also suggest p2p lending? R/investing had convinced me that my entire portfolio was supposed to default when the market goes down.. but I am still up  about 7% ytd on that. That's 15% better than the S&amp;P 500 right now. (Only put like 10% here).

Otherwise, please sell me all of your stocks at the bottom of the crash. Once someone convinces you the entire market is rigged against us by the billionaires (Rather than just human psychology forcing everyone to do the same thing at the same exact time &lt;-- *hint hint*) and you decide to just hold cash forever, i will be buying your shares at the bottom.

15-08-25,3iciby,Criminal Defense Attorney Sentenced for Insider Trading,"www.StockPromoters.com

Criminal defense attorney Douglas Parigian was sentenced last week for conspiring to use inside information about the business activities of American Superconductor Corporation (NASDAQ: AMSC) to profit from trading the company’s stock.

U.S. District Court Judge Denise J. Casper sentenced Parigian to eight months of home confinement and three years of supervised release. Parigian is also required to cooperate if ordered to disgorge his trading profits, pay a penalty in the related civil enforcement action brought against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and to comply with any order issued by state licensing authorities suspending or revoking his license to practice law.

Judge Casper cited Parigian’s clean criminal record and his role in raising his four-year-old twin girls as what he considered valid reasons to keep the attorney from doing prison time.

In May 2015, Parigian pleaded guilty to insider trading and securities fraud after Casper refused to dismiss the case. Prosecutors had requested 24 months in jail, plus three years of supervised release.

Beginning around July 2009, a friend of Parigian’s, Eric McPhail, began giving Parigian and others inside information about AMSC’s business activities and upcoming earnings announcements. McPhail obtained this information during golf matches, dinners, and other social outings with a senior executive at AMSC; both men were members of the Oakley Country Club in Watertown, Mass. The AMSC executive trusted McPhail to keep the information to himself and was unaware that McPhail was instead tipping Parigian and others.

Between July 2009 and April 2011, Parigian, who knew the information was confidential and that it was improper for McPhail to disclose it, nonetheless repeatedly traded on it, making approximately $275,000 in illicit gains and avoided losses.

In June 2015, McPhail was convicted after trial and is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 17, 2015.

Parigian’s home confinement will include electronic monitoring and a curfew from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.",0

****edit: found solution - 
All UK stocks are quoted in pence (and parts of pence)
All US stocks in $ and cents
All european in euros and euro cents.
So all UK share prices would be divided by 100 if you wanted it to look 'normal'
498.98 therefore is £4.9898 (just under £5)

15-08-25,3icjz3,"""China Sinks World Markets, Not World Economy""","From a few days ago: 
""Our main worry is that some trader or corporation somewhere, with a little too much debt and wrong about China's direction, will be put in some severe financial duress. Because of China's more closed economy, we don't, however, believe that a weakening China will result in the same financial contagion as the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis. Still, the possibility cannot be ruled out, and with memories of 2008 and 2009 still fresh, potential fear can overwhelm the reality of the economic situation, causing investors to hit the panic button around the world.
The economic news was surprisingly good for the U.S. and even Europe (a nice increase in their purchasing manager reports) this week, perhaps suggesting that China is not the be-all and the end-all of the world economy. U.S. housing data was especially strong this week with recovery high housing starts and existing-home sales. Those strong numbers should have knock-on effects on the U.S. economy as those homes are financed, furnished, and remodeled.
Inflation was also surprisingly tame, taking a little heat off the Federal Reserve. Its most recent set of minutes, which seemed to show a greater willingness to raise rates, are not terribly relevant as the situation in China worsened. It's tough to justify a rate increase in the face of financial turmoil. However, it is highly unlikely that the Fed understood how strong the U.S. economy was in the second quarter. Next week, based on already-released data, we suspect the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis will raise the GDP growth rate for the second quarter from 2.2% to a range of 3.0%-3.5% with the emphasis on the higher end of that range. For the full year we are still expecting U.S. growth of 2.0%-2.5%.""

Im a fairly new trader, I got in about 1.5 months ago (yeah the worst time.)

I trade extremely high dollar amounts because I have the capital. This means my capital losses, if I sell everything right now, is over the limit of $3K to write-off.

If I formed an LLC or S-Corp, to manage/trade/invest my funds, and that corporation has capital losses over $3K by year end, would that be a way to allow me to deduct more than the 3K limit? Basically just transfer my personal assets into the LLC, and the LLC is the one doing the trading/investing.

Would this be a more efficient way to setup my trading, for tax purposes?

Thanks",1

15-08-24,3i71kx,Not a bad time to buy AAPL calls.,"Fear is the only sentiment driving AAPL down. Not earnings. Not the risk of an Apple product failing. Sure, the risk of AAPL sales eroding in China if they fall into a recession is there, but Apple's market share in China isn't just going to disappear.

So, if fear is the only thing driving AAPL down, then the only question becomes how low is AAPL going to go before fear is replaced by greed and the stock becomes bullish again?

The answer is likely somewhere between $90-99. If AAPL hit 90, I would jump at the opportunity (I think many people would). We've hit 98 in pre-market now. It wouldn't be the worst time to pick up some stock at least, or if you have a bit more risk appetite, some October/December calls.

I'm not saying it's the BEST time to buy calls, but not a bad time.",0

15-08-24,3i7284,"Do not Panic - why Value Investors (today's pessimist) should not worry about speculators (today's optimist)","Today’s optimist sees nothing but growth today-and-tomorrow.  The optimist sees growth today through an increase in opportunities in stock.  Over the past six years, those who have invested into nearly any stock have seen growth in their portfolios at an exceptional pace.  Those who invested into Victoria’s Secret (LB) at $6.26 on March 6, 2009, for example, would have netted a 1,198.56 percent gain today (August 19, 2015) at $81.27.  In addition to believing that growth is occurring today, the optimist believes that growth will occur tomorrow.  By spending six years in growth, the bullish investor is forgetting the events of 2007 and 2008, ones which led to collapse of stock price.  Without past memories, the amnesiac bullish investor will willingly invest into any trendy company so long as the price of the company continues to increase.  There is no need to time the market since the market will continue to rise in price. 
	
The optimist will believe the growth will last forever due to the fiscal policy of the Federal Reserve.  In contrast to decades prior, when the 1970’s brought a time of high interest rates, today’s interest rates are next-to-nothing.  With cheap money beckons cheap gains.   Those who have easier access to money have easier access to stocks that takes advantage of the cheap money.  Today’s climate has seen record amounts of mergers-and-acquisitions through cheap debt.  Charter Communications, a debt-laden cable company, has acquired Time Warner Cable through cheap funds. No doubt, the optimist that seeks easy money will love easy gains. 
	
Optimists invest almost exclusively into securities.  The only land that allows for significant growth above interest rates comes from stocks.  The lack of inflation, the Federal Reserve preferring stocks over bonds, and belief that prosperity will prevent default, have all caused bond yields to shrink to record lows.  Yields in European countries now include negative percentages.  In other words, those who invest into Switzerland bonds, for example, will lose money once they pull out their money.   The optimist, therefore, has established a permanent resident in the city of Stocks. 

The optimistic speculator of today will brag to his or her colleagues of his or her portfolio. In said portfolio contains a variety of securities trading at lofty P/E ratios.  Be it Facebook, Netflix, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Under Armor, and/or Amazon, today’s speculator looks for the securities equivalent of Kate Upton, the “it girl.”
	
Meanwhile, today’s pessimist is worried about the current affairs of the market.  The pessimist realizes that the growth of gains will not last forever.  In fact, based on historical events, it would appear as if growth will slow down in the upcoming years.  Those who invest today will not experience the same gains exhibited by the optimists from two years prior; nor would today’s pessimistic investor want to invest into today’s market either. When a company such as Facebook has a higher valuation than Proctor &amp; Gamble, when Netflix has a higher valuation than CBS Corporation,  history shows that irrational exuberance will eventually catch up to irrational investors. 

Much of today’s money used to purchase stocks comes from cheap money, funds made cheaper by the lowering of interest rates by the Federal Reserve over the same six years.  In a world of balance, the raising of the interest rate will lower stock prices; and in this same world, those who made gains today will lose them tomorrow.   

The pessimist is concerned about bond yields.  In a world where risk today is the same as risk five years previous, yields in both corporate and Government have decreased significantly.  One disturbing indication of the lowered bond yields involves a world where Solar City bonds have a return similar to American bonds.    
	
The value investor looks for stocks that are hated by the mass market.  Said investor metaphorically drives around at midnight without any headlights to guide him or her towards a certain value security.  Rather, it is instinct and logic that allows the value driver to traverse towards the destination.  While the collective market believes that Nathan’s, Michael Kors, Lumber Liquidators, Micron Technology, and oil stocks will end in burning flames, the value investor sees these stocks as paradise. 
	
Tomorrow brings the opposite for both today’s optimist and pessimist.  When tomorrow comes, the roles will be reversed. Whereas today’s optimist is full of joy, tomorrows will be full of sorrow.  While today’s pessimist holds back, tomorrows will push forward. 
	
Tomorrow’s pessimist will look in their portfolio and notice that many of their stocks that they held yesterday have been corrected towards a fairer value.   History shows this as fact.  The Yahoo of 1999 that closed at $108.17 closed at $4.34 in 2001. The investor who paid $2,073.76 in 2000 for AIG watched as their stock declined to $7 in 2009. Likewise, the investor who paid $69 for Twitter in 2014 is now seeing the stock at $27.60. Contrary to popular belief, timing the market is everything.  Those who invested into Microsoft at its’ peak in 1999 has lost 6.57 percent of their original value in 2015, despite years of steady growth and value investing principals. 
	
Tomorrow’s pessimist will lament over the easiness of receiving funds during the peak of the market from a lowered interest rate.  Tomorrow’s pessimist will lament in the same way that they lamented in 2008 when they invested into bank stocks that collapsed due to the nature of their investments from cheap interest rates.  Tomorrow’s pessimist will also lament over investing into heavily leveraged companies that, now held to accountability, collapse under their weight.  AT&amp;T in 1999 bought TCI Communications from John Malone in a heavily leveraged deal in order to establish telecommunications supremacy.  The problem was that the funds came from cheap means through a lowered interest rate.  Once accountability was set forth, AT&amp;T discovered that they were unable to combat their debt, eventually becoming insolvent with massive short-term debt. 
	
The pessimist of tomorrow will weep as their returns on former popular stocks plummet.  The former optimist will have held onto their stocks under the notion that the speculative companies will have recovered in price. This will prove not to be the case as in a market correction, formerly overvalued stocks will become more efficient via matching the price with value; and while the stocks of yesterday were high in price in contrast to its’ value, the price today would be low in comparison to its’ value.   Some of tomorrow’s pessimist will escape to bonds under the idea that price fluctuations in securities will affect bonds.  However, the speculator will realize that not only have yields collapsed due to the actions of the speculator, but many companies involved in the bond market collapsed due to a burgeoning of debt.   
In contrast to tomorrow’s pessimist, tomorrow’s optimist will be hopeful of the future. While the price of a stock during tomorrow’s market may be significantly lower than in the years prior, the value of many stocks has increased.  More risk arbitrage opportunities open up for the optimist.  Over a six-and-a-half year period, the stock of Dillard’s increased 1,815.11 percent .   While the stock had tremendous value – even in the market correction of the late-2000’s, the stock decreased in price simply because nearly every other stock did. The optimist of 2008 may have invested into the stock when the pessimist was selling; and in the process, may prove to increase their long-term income.  
The optimist of tomorrow will welcome the actions of the federal  reserve in increasing interest rates.  As interest rates rise, the stock price decreases.   As the interest rate rises, securities are held to accountability more compared to when the interest rates were down.  The optimist of tomorrow buys securities tomorrow in the same vein that a young female might buy bras-and-panties at a Victoria’s Secret semi-annual sale. 
	
Bonds, convertibles, and preferred securities,  will become prevalent for optimists of tomorrow.  Companies that the investor knows have the capability of surviving yet are considered by tomorrow’s pessimist as in dire straits is a company that, while higher in yield, will be beneficiary to the opportunistic investor.  It is this reason that Warren Buffett was able to invest heavily into Goldman Sachs, General Electric, and Harley Davidson, companies whose fixed-income yields greatly surpassed the yields of yesterday’s optimist. 

Today’s pessimist has nothing to worry about in terms of today’s market.  It is true that the pessimist of today has little-to-no-returns to show for in comparison to the optimist of today.  However, once the snowball effect takes place in a bursting market, the pessimist will convert into an optimist, having been given numerous opportunities to use risk arbitrage.  Meanwhile, the optimist of tomorrow must not interfere in the actions of today’s optimist. As Luke 9:60 said, “Jesus said to him ‘let the dead bury their own dead.’” ",0

I also did not expect [this kind of response]( http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=%5EVIX+Interactive#{""range"":""1d"",""allowChartStacking"":true}) in the market place to what is without question a market correction in China.

**Welcome to one of the most volatile markets of the decade!** This is a rare moment and you should cherish it because we don’t experience days like today very often. Well, try to forget about your portfolio, cherish this moment, and then keep reading. In fact, the Volatility Index hasn’t hit this day time high of 53.29 since the 2008 Financial crisis. So what are we to think of this? We have a growing population, a growing economy, earnings are still growing here in the U.S… I have always taken issue with the way unemployment is measured in the U.S. but it’s still better than it was in the aftermath of 2008. We don’t have a liquidity crisis. We will get to keep our homes this time. Why is everything nominally tearing downwards when our real lives seem just fine? This is something worth talking about. Here are my thoughts:

**The futures curve is not a prediction of future prices.** Say what? That’s right, let me say it again for emphasis: The futures curve is not a prediction of future prices. I don’t care if its corn oil or concentrated orange juice. But this is a common perception of futures curves, and we all woke up to a radical downward shift in futures curves, so what is happening? In academia when calculating the true value of a futures contract there is one variable we use called the *Convenience Yield.* In simple terms, the convenience yield is the implied value of having downside protection in holding a futures contract. If you were able to buy a future today on say (the value of your own portfolio) for $X amount, and sell it a few months later when you were more certain of the economic value of your portfolio (what you could buy with it and sell it for) you would put value to the convenience of downside protection. This is why futures contracts are not future prices, there is value in certainty.

So what am I getting at? Markets are not perfectly efficient. Say what? I am full of surprises today aren’t I? Okay so markets are perfectly efficient, they will adjust entirely to the financial news of today over time, a year from now hindsight will be 20/20, this will be a blip in market movements. But today, do we know what will happen in China? What if the Fed raises rates? What if NK goes to war? Our market is not perfectly incorporating future events because they haven’t happened yet, Volatility, Volume, a spike in the Convenience yield? These are all signs of fear, but it’s not 2008 anymore.

**We are seeing an amazing amount of volume in the market data** There is a lesson to be learned from all of this stuff. When ’08 happened many investors reacted by panic selling, today some are taking profits and buying gold off of Fox news. Look you thought the valuations in equities looked a little high didn’t you, at least agree with me that the Shake Shack valuation was hilariously silly. But why didn’t you pour every dollar into a short position, why didn’t I? Because timing the market wrong can bankrupt a strategy based on timing the market right alone. You might think the Fed created this mess, or China did, or irrational investors did, maybe you were calling the top on Friday, or maybe you were calling the bottom, but it’s easy, so easy to type these words. Our risk tolerances prevent us from bearing the pain of being completely wrong in an all in strategy, this is why we diversify, and hope all trees are growing towards the sky. You will lose most of the time in an all in situation because being right in the short run is nearly impossibly expensive, especially for the Chinaman who borrowed on their homes.
And this party looked so good didn’t it? We all loved the returns in our 401k’s didn’t we? We knew something was coming, but none of us had the balls to try and time it because we would have been wrong for the last 7 years. So we wait and retroactively react.

**So what do you think was happening in China** when people were mortgaging their homes to buy equity positions in ridiculously overvalued Chinese firms? Everyone wanted in on the party as long as it lasted, now everybody wants out because the average Chinese investor doesn’t even understand how valuation works. 

**The problem in markets today is a valuation problem.** We are entirely different from China in that we are still experiencing earnings growth in the United States, things are good here. But we are entirely similar to China in that on a Macro level we behave just as they do, we are all human anyways. No one wants to leave a party until it’s over, and no one wanted to get out of the market until the last 5 days. 
Anybody can take a buy recommendation on a few stocks seriously and get in the market for the last 7 years and then all of a sudden when all this fear arises. People get scared, they think to themselves “what the hell did I just do, why do I even own Baidu and Tesla, it had a buy rating on Yahoo finance?!” But they don’t have their own target price, or their own valuation. Either red looks like a time to stop and get out to the emotional investor or red looks like buying opportunities to disciplined investor and guys the disciplined investor always wins.
*So what do we do now?*

Hey [u/sayitlikeyoumemeit](https://www.reddit.com/user/sayitlikeyoumemeit) is this your time? [Some people are in tears today,]( https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3hwo1s/you_lost_3_in_your_portfolio_today_lets_take_a/cubakh0) what should we do? I have a few ideas. First, you know what the dividend yield in dollar terms in my portfolio was today? The same that it was Friday, and Thursday, and Wednesday. Guys if you want downside protection and upside potential dividend stocks are a place of safety in times of uncertainty. Secondly, remember how I told you about my rolling vix call option portfolio? Well since Vix is up a whopping 45.34% and is at it’s 5 year high I have a proposal for you: Buy Puts. The stock market can have a correction over three months but that won’t create a value for the implied volatility like we have seen today. Buy the right to sell it at $40 for $20.48 on February 17th and just sit on your hands if you’re feeling lucky ;) I don’t see implied volatility going much higher over 6 months.

**As for Commodities I don’t understand the fuss** Who cares oil is now $37.93? this is a great thing for Uber, a great thing for Amazon, for PepsiCo, and for my discretionary spending (I drive a jeep the gas mileage is quite horrid.) But I do my share for global warming and guys what you have to understand is that cheap oil is great for everyone who isn’t trying to sell cheap oil. We should welcome it, find confidence in the new market equilibrium, and hope this delays getting some fracking runoff in our well-water! 

In conclusion, I’m not calling the top or the bottom, but I am calling the top for volatility for now. Valuations are out of whack, but this isn’t 2008, I don’t believe we should have the same concerns for our market as the Chinese have for theirs. If you are a lazy investor, now is the time to see red as an opportunity to buy. I’m not saying everything is a good deal. But this is a good time to brush up on fundamentals, get a basic understanding of operating cash flow, and hunt for value (and dividend value) understanding that it provides both downside protection and upside potential in the long run.

15-08-25,3icv2v,Investing question from a novice... question has nothing to do with the recent market fluctuations,"Backstory: Up until recently, my husband and I had ""normal"" corporate jobs with 401ks and employer matching. We automatically had a % of our paychecks deposited into our 401ks, and didn't have to think about much else. Last year I started a new career and I have independent contractor status... no more 401k. I rolled over into an IRA. Now my husband has just left his company for a new one, and although he's not an independent contractor, the new company does not offer a 401k. So, we are getting ready to roll his 401k over into an IRA. We want to be sure to continue to deposit money into our new retirement accounts regularly, and will set up an automated withdraw to do so. 

The question (finally): Since I'm an independent contractor, no taxes are withheld from my paychecks. Should I just continue to contribute to my rollover IRA, or should I open a Roth IRA instead? What advantage, if any, is there to us having both types of retirement accounts? (About us: 36/f and 40/m with household income of about $150. My income is now commission-based and can fluctuate wildly.)",1

15-08-24,3i79h1,"Reddit, 1.5 years ago I left my job at a hedge fund to bridge the gap between Yahoo Finance and Bloomberg. Here is an update – and an awesome stock screener","**EDIT 12:50PM EST**: Server should be more stable now. Added more nodes and bumped connection limits. Thanks for bearing with me!

I hope you all are dealing okay with the market vol. I have some tools on the site to backtest portfolios if you it's helpful for you all. Also all news feeds are live so if you want to monitor things.


I write this to you all because I would say r/investing’s feedback has led 60% of the changes on the site. The flood of users 4 months ago led to so much feedback that I holed myself up and started re-coding the site for a few months. It was emotionally challenging work and you all were so kind with words of encouragement. Anyway, here we are 4 months later and with an update.

One thing I’ve been building in particular is a badass stock screener. With the advice of a few on this subreddit, a couple equity hedge fund managers, and a former analyst at Fairholme, I think I cracked it. 


You can see the screener here: https://www.tiingo.com/screen/o and more detailed explanations of how it’s different here: http://blog.tiingo.com/building-the-worlds-most-powerful-stock-screener-2/

**EDIT**: Please be patient with the screener, it's being hug-of-deathed right now and more complicated metrics may be a bit slower (20 seconds). 

Also The most frequent bugs right now are coming from custom-created metrics. The metrics typed in must match exactly what appears. I have to be super strict about enforcing this in order to protect the servers.

The jist is this:

1. Totally reenvisioned the UI for how we screen, from many textboxes to a drag-and-drop process to capture the idea of a screener being in an investor’s workflow.

2. You can create your own screening metrics, so if I don’t have one, you can use the formula builder. Because of the complexity of this, it may take an addition 5-10 seconds to get your results using a custom metric.

3. Since screeners show you stocks you’ve never seen before, simply click a company on the “Results” tab and a dialog will come up showing you a description, a price chart, and the latest news for that sock.

4. The screener integrates into the portfolio you set up on Tiingo – so you can see how every screened stock correlates to your portfolio. This can help find stocks that fit your screening thesis and also provide the most amount of diversification.

5. I have a couple metrics not available elsewhere, like when you screen by benchmark/Index, you can see the weighting of that stock within that benchmark/Index. You can also screen based on correlation to macro factors (Stocks, bonds, gold, oil).

6. You can actually see the values of the metrics you screened for and also export to Excel/CSV.

Note: Right now the site is made for mobile, except the screener. It may be a bit difficult to use in mobile if not in landscape mode.

I hope you all enjoy the screener!  

Below are some more updates I attribute to users on this sub.

-------------

The changes you all asked me to make were so incredible, once I implemented them, I started getting media attention. I really do mean that. If you want to see what the first iteration of the site was, check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq2TAU7MLjc

Anyway, a trading magazine covered Tiingo in its cover story next to a company worth over $700mm. A second CEO of a media company gave a shout-out in her keynote at a conference twice.   A couple HF managers are advertising Tiingo’s risk systems in their decks and I may soon have my first equity hedge fund client who is replacing his Bloomberg terminal with Tiingo. The goal is to make this project affordable to all with a “set your own price” model.  

I cannot thank you all enough for your kind words. Seriously, even when the site looked super shitty, you all were encouraging.

Feel free to check out other portions of the site. The portfolio tracking now has correlation calcs, beta calcs, and backtests. There is 10+ years of structured fundamental data for 4,800+ stocks and I have a risk parity tool.

If you have any suggestions, I would love to hear them :)

--
A few other misc things: I don’t have nearly the same breadth as Bloomberg when it comes to international stocks or other asset classes. My goal has been to become competent in one asset class first and hit the majority of use cases.

15-08-25,3icx6y,WSB primer on how China trading works.,"OK look, you guys need to understand how Chinese shares work.

China has A shares, and Hong Kong has H shares.

You can buy and trade H shares as a foreigner (both through ADRs and your own purchase). But you can't touch A shares.

The A shares are traded by degenerates and people that speculate up stock prices just by Xi JinPing eating some brand of food.

As a result of the gambling mentality, the A shares have lost any tracking with the H counterparts. This has caused a ridiculous AH premium to materialize.


On Monday, while china crashed, the AH premium did not. Which meant that all the Hong Kong counterparts were significantly and grossly overvalued.

On Tuesday, the AH premium tracked the A shares decline sharply and Hong Kong traded up as a result, even though China was down 7%.


Most of Monday's crash is to be blamed on the emerging markets in general. Not China.

15-08-25,3iabae,"Don't forget what is really behind ""“The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent"" - this is a marketplace, not a magical force","Meaning, the price of anything you see is determined by buyers and sellers.  For the price of something to go up, someone has to be on the other side of the transaction willing to buy it at a higher price.  There seems to be this underlying euphoria in so much of what I read on this sub that defaults to stocks going up both in the immediate term, because the economy is doing ok/better, and in the long term, just because it always has.  

Those can be very ethereal concepts but remember the famous advice above.  There's no force driving the market back up just because the economy is good.  If tomorrow there was some special amazing news on GDP, or the Fed made some one time bullish decision, or whatever it may be - the market doesn't go up on its own.  Millions of people just like you and me and, unfortunately, robots programmed in very sophisticated ways, have to BELIEVE that that information actually means something positive.  

And, just as important, do not forget that there are massive institutions literally billions of times larger than you that can make money in BOTH directions.  

So, what this means tangibly is - buying NFLX at $90 or AAPL at $92 - that's probably a safe bet that no one thinks those are the right prices.  But buying anything that falls a good number of % just because surely the market must go back up and this is just panic and this is a correction - you're going to have to find a buyer that believes that at some point down the road.  And if you didn't buy stocks when they were 5 - 10 - 15% higher than they were right now, why should someone else?",5

15-08-24,3i7lub,Is this a viable trading strategy or just an issue of low volume?,"I made sure to watch the market open today so I can better prepare myself for similar situations in the future. Something strange I noticed took place among several low volume ETFs and I'd like to know if this is common and a potential strategy to look out for in the future.

Example tickers:
PJP,
IHE

On open these specific ETFs, along with other low volume ETFs in Small/mid cap funds, absolutely tanked. For example PJP dropped a staggering 61% from the open to its daily low. I understand these daily lows can be a bit misleading at times, however over a 10-20 minute period this morning this specific ETF was trading in a range that was 42-60% from the daily open. The vast majority of ETFs and stocks today didn't drop below 15-20%. 

So my question is: Is it a viable trading strategy to place Limit Buy Orders in the future for these small volume ETFs when there is expected broad-market volatility? Do retail investors even have a shot at having their orders filled or is this simply a war of the trading bots and there is nothing we can do to take advantage of these huge swings?",1

Worst case scenario? I lost $450. I'm okay with that, and I think after the crash is over, I'll be happy I got out (so I can buy back in).

I think everyone really needs to take a step back and do more research on the role China is going to have on our markets over the coming years. 

The Chinese market is so unique in so many ways. Their market capital is comprised of 85% retail investors! That is a huge percentage of capital that is in the hands of emotionally driven, inexperienced retail investors. Taking another step back It's even more complex considering the Chinese Gov has their hands in every piece of the pie from market news manipulation, setting IPO dates, quickly changing laws and regulations for what amount and when their citizens can invest, etc.

In short, the Chinese market is a beast that has never been seen before and there are zero historical events to show what implications their knee-jerk, retail investors will have on the world economy. I've been doing more and more research into the topic and am currently trying to figure out how much Chinese retail investor money is tied up in specific US stocks/ETFs (if any). I know It's hard for them to get their money outside of China and into foreign investments which is a good thing for all of us invested in S&amp;P 500 ETFs and US based stocks that don't derive boat loads of money from Chinese sales.

One other thing I didn't mention above as well regarding their citizens: The Chinese LOVE to gamble! Is investing for them just a newfound source of 'gambling' that is going to be manipulated to hell and back by their Gov?

which goes into detail to explain that early monday morning, volatility and a lack of liquidity made some stocks shoot up and down over a short period of time. In fact, General Electric stock (GE) bounced between 20.30 and 22.00 (a difference of $1.70 per share) 6 times within 5 seconds.

https://twitter.com/nanexllc/status/635888465037684736/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw


My question is: how does this happen?
Is it really possible that 'the book' of sell orders vs. buy orders varied by this much over that short of a time?

15-08-24,3i7ygl,How many of you are college students gambling with student loan money? No Vaseline - WSB Edition,"As someone who has tasted failure a few times and lived through some shit, I often forget about just how 'yolo' the young twenty-somethings really can be.  
  
I am constantly referring back to an old college friend of mine named Evan, who was a business-minded kid with the fortune to be born with a Jewish last name of Ros-something so he was probably going play life on easy mode if he kept his shit together.  
  
Unfortunately, he *did not* keep his shit together.  He took his entire excess student loan money each semester and gambled it away on online blackjack sites.  Pretty soon he bumped up to some nose candy.  Then he wasn't attending class at all anymore, and figured out a way to go even deeper over his head and gamble more.  
  
""Wow,"" you're thinking.  ""I can't believe that idiot.  Online blackjack sites?""  
  
The sad part is he was smarter than you.  At least he had about a 50% chance of winning those bets.  You?  Following the herd and trying to learn this cut throat game with money you can't afford to lose?  
  
Fuck you, you're a God damned idiot on a scale that makes Evan look like an innocent puppy.  You could take a predatory loan or a credit card cash advance, piss it away in bad options bets, and then tell the company to go fuck itself when they wanted you to pay it back.  Sure, debt collectors will harass you for years and you will be in your late 20's before you can get a car loan or house but what's amazing about our first world is you really don't have to pay that money back.  You can basically rob that company and get away with it.  
  
Not with student loan debt.   You're fucked dude.  They will never let you escape that debt, and you won't be inconveniencing yourself for a few years...  You are basically trading your future for a roll of the dice.  
  
And it's D20 where any roll from 1 -  19 is a remix of Ice Cube's No Vaseline, specially recorded for you.  
  
I watched this sub grow from 4,000 people to 20,000 and I know sixteen thousand responsible options traders didn't suddenly discover this place.  **What *actually* happened was a bunch of college students watched Wolf of Wallstreet in their dorm room, played with stocks in GTA5, and thought 'fuk yeah imma do it for realz!'**  
  
You think you're some maverick who is about to bust into a secret wealth circle and change your whole life, but what you **actually** are is the the rube who wandered into a cash poker game with some of the World Series of Poker Stars and sat down with a fresh pile of chips right as they started to get bored picking on each other.  
  
You feel that miniskirt and lipstick?  That's *yours*, and you're wandering through cell block D you idiotic little fuck.

As some of you may know, this is something I have spent a lot of time on and after many, many months of planning and several setbacks, Project YOLO! is finally a go.

First, the website: [www.RoadtoYolo.com](http://www.RoadtoYolo.com)

The rules of #ProjectYOLO are simple:

1. You pitch and recommend a trade on [/r/wsb](http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets)
2. If your trade is executed, you earn 10% of any gains on it
3. If your trade loses money, you don't lose or gain anything.

Here's my challenge to you, /r/wsb: **Can you guys take a $10,000 cash portfolio and grow it to $100,000?** I think you can. I think we genius minds, grouped together, can help earn a 1,000% YOLOreturn. And if we do, then the [Yolocalypse!](http://roadtoyolo.com/yolocalypse/) happens! This means even MORE yolo.

All together, we can not only beat, but crush the market. Every trade will be done using my money. This is the PERFECT project for people who always wanted to trade, but never dared to or had an opportunity to. There is literally 0 risk to you and you get to make a little bit of money if your trade works.

With that in mind, let's kick off #ProjectYOLO with a bang. To make a trade pitch, simply make a new thread here on WSB or on [/r/roadtoyolo](http://www.reddit.com/r/roadtoyolo). MAKE SURE YOUR TITLE STARTS WITH [YOLO] SO I DON'T MISS ANY and include all relevant details in the title (contract name, exchange, expiration if applicable, etc.). 

Include the full reasons you are recommending this trade in the body of the thread you make. The more detailed and precise your arguments are, the better. I will analyze all trades and give you some feedback (or do the trade). All pitches will be considered and, better yet, you may start right now. **I expect to have at least 3 yolo trades in by tomorrow.**

LETS DO THIS MOTHERYOLOERS! 

And remember: The Road to #Yolo is Paved With Terrible Trades.

**EDIT:** Stop posting YOLO in comments guys, we need a thread so we can keep track of them and post comments. And also so that you can't edit them later on.",26

The only thing that made me go Hmmm .. is that I got an eerie sense of deja vu back to 2008 . In 2008 , two things happened in August. Crude prices cratered and the Baltic Dry Index and shipping rates started falling rapidly in the month of August. This was before any carnage was outwardly visible. And then two months later everything cratered.
Ofcourse this time it's different. We've already been through hell and as far as I'm concerned nothing can match that carnage again.

A lot of this nervousness might be because of the eerily similar situation. But make no mistake , we're in for another period of weakness in the global economy from China , slowing shipping , declining crude etc , the stock market however is protected as long as QE is there.

15-08-25,3ibfky,"The market collapse; from today's WSJ","The unfolding stock-market collapse—the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted more than 1,000 points on Monday morning, rebounding later to nearly 600 points down, following several days of decline last week—is the inevitable result of the Federal Reserve’s policies, namely quantitative easing that produced abnormally low interest rates. The decline on Wall Street has spread to every stock market on the globe, many of which were also weakened by their own policies of excessively easy money.

With virtually no yield available on government bonds and other low-risk fixed-income securities, investors were tempted to climb on the bandwagon of rising share prices. Some sophisticated investors realized that the rapid increase of share prices was a bubble that would end when interest rates returned to normal. They invested on the mistaken theory that they would know when to pull out.

Though the recent decision to start selling was triggered by a variety of events, including the collapse of oil prices world-wide and financial chaos in China, the high price-earnings ratios were enough to make the downturn inevitable. All that was needed was a spark to start the process, just as the increased defaults of subprime mortgages did in 2007.",3

15-08-25,3ibgk8,Where are the opportunities?,"Ok, admittedly I'm a rookie, I love the amount of knowledge thrown back and forth in this sub and rarely post, cuz I'm not on that level.  But with this...crater in the market, I think I can overcome my initial ""the sky is falling"" reaction and see through the fog.

This isn't OUR fault.  Right?  China is a big dog in the world, maybe the biggest, if not now, sometime soon.  Exposure to China is a big red flag at this moment.  But it's also dragging everything down, even those stocks nowhere close to China-related.

So I ask you this.  With the huge drops in most stocks, where are the buying opportunities?

I'm getting killed daily because I refused to dump great companies while they slid.  I have faith that they'll come back.  There's always going to be a new high, or a new 52 week high.  Sure I might have to wait, but I have years to wait.  I'm investing, not day trading.

I currently own AAPL, DIS, ETP, AC.To (not sure how to write a Canadian symbol exactly), AVH (smallest holding, biggest loser % wise).

I bought more DIS on one of the early dips after the quarterly report, which I thought was overblown to begin with, but it's done nothing but tumble since then.

If I gave you $10,000 right now...where would you put it?  Doesn't have to be 1 of my 5, I'd appreciate that insight, but I'm open to suggestion.

FWIW...I bought AVH as a small spec, based on the growth I've seen first hand on the ground in Colombia and the EU visa requirement removals.  I know I probably shouldn't have 2 airlines, but AC I own for diff reasons, I'm a customer, former employee, I think it's well run and I think it's headed in the right direction.",0

Simply said, Etsy has no lasting advantage. It's a bit like GoFundMe (on which you wrote an article on, I think), but without the ""let's save the world"" aspect. 

Etsy is not profitable and never will. This is another of these companies that waste million after millions on... I don't know on what exactly. Furthermore, while there is an advantage for someone to list on Etsy, nothing prevents a business from leaving it to open their own website - after all, they already have to process the payment, so what's a $9.95 per month hosting plan with wordpress and a $8.75 per year domain when compared to the $0.20+3.5% etsy charges (lol).

With $61M in revenue that is bound to peak (lol!), Etsy is grossly, grossly, GROSSLY overpriced. A fairer market value would be around 1.5 times its annual sales, or $360M, 25% of what it is today. I would bet on it going this low quite quickly.

My point is mostly that Etsy doesn't offer anything unique or even valuable to buyers. The fees are insane and people are much, much, MUCH better opening their own website rather than waste money on this crap. Sure, it's the fad of the moment, and it's probably a very good fad, but it's not an investable business and it is grossly overpriced.

They can still sell/use this new product after mid-Sept in Europe (and soon in Brazil).  

Amedica Announces Addition of the Valeo II(TM) Lateral Lumbar Interbody Fusion Device System
Lateral Lumbar Spinal Fusion Procedures Becoming One of the Fastest Growing Segments

SALT LAKE CITY, Aug. 25, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amedica Corporation (Nasdaq:AMDA), an innovative biomaterial company which develops and manufactures silicon nitride as a platform for biomedical applications, is pleased to announce the release of its silicon nitride lateral lumbar (LL) interbody fusion device.  The Valeo II™ LL interbody fusion device will be commercially available in mid-September 2015, and will include second generation instrumentation to improve patient safety and surgeon ease of use.

""With the release of our new lateral system, we are now able to offer an additional lumbar solution to our line of second generation silicon nitride interbody devices,"" said Dr. Sonny Bal, chairman and CEO of Amedica Corporation. ""Initial feedback from our beta users has been positive and we're very pleased to offer this lateral interbody fusion device system, which provides surgeons additional procedure options and allows Amedica access to one of the fastest growing segments in the lumbar fusion market.""

The Valeo II™ LL is made of a micro composite silicon nitride biomaterial, which offers a superior environment for bone growth and osteointegration, when compared to competitive PEEK and titanium offerings. Amedica's Valeo II™ silicon nitride interbody fusion devices also contain anti-infective properties and are semi-radiolucent with clearly visible boundaries in X-rays and produce no artifacts under MRI or CT scans. The combination of these properties is found only in Amedica's silicon nitride biomaterial technology.
                                            
The Valeo II™ LL is indicated for intervertebral body fusion of the spine in skeletally mature patients and is designed for use with autograft to facilitate fusion. Additional information about Amedica's complete line of products can be found at www.amedica.com.",7

15-08-25,3ic9hl,Does anyone here actually have a consistent and scalable investment plan?,"I've been trading for several years now and I've noticed that my OTM, low-risk, low-return, longer-term strategies are my most profitable in the long term.  Sure, I have traded trends, IE: I caught the April TSLA rally for a full 60 point profit - but these huge payoffs are unpredictable, rare, and thus cannot be scaled into a consistent schema of trading.    Obviously a subreddit called ""Wall Street Bets"" is going to indulge in the excitement of gambling, but I'm curious to know how many of you are indebted to the gamble.

The elusive nature of a profitable day trader is best understood by an article profiling a Japanese daytrader named CIS: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-09-25/mystery-man-moving-japan-made-more-than-1-million-trades 

He is wrong almost half of the time, but his profitability is owed to the fact that he has a consistency that is scalable.  His losses are less costly than his winnings are profitable because of those consistency rules and not because of his insight into market direction.  Also worth noting that his trading frequency does not bias past performance indicators - he trades simple trends without much indication, hundreds of times a day - the net profit from cutting off losers and keeping winners is because his minimalism wins. 

Think about it: even in a random, patternless, erratic, market - only the most reductive strategy can identify with those rules of consistency.  As randomness grows, rules become a liability.  In a purely random market, your rules must match the nature of the market in order to profit - IE: the rule that the market is random is the only true rule in a purely random market.  What is known for CIS is not that a specific trend exists, but that trends in GENERAL, exist:  His rules seek out those trends, but are wrong 4 out of 10 times.  What ""wrong"" is, is understood by the rule itself - if trends in general exist, then being ""wrong"" is identifying that this particular trend is not like all the other trends.  He does not specify why a particular stock's rally is profitable, and he does not correlate it to the $Tick or employ any technical analysis, rather - his analysis is restricted to the few rules he has:  IT is reductive because he decides that the trend he decides to invest in must match the general schema of all trends.   This eschews the need to find reasons:  It is not that AAPL is rallying higher for a specific reason - it is that AAPL is rallying in a way that closely matches a general rally: that is important - he is a computer studying stochastic resonance, not earnings reports, news, technical analysis, or anything else.  He is wrong almost half of the time, but because his plan is scalable, he is incredibly profitable.

The SPY has been in a quad top. It has hit the ceiling around 212 MANY times! this is the main reason we are in a down trend, among other worldly reasons. [See my chart here](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SPY/HlV30TER-spy-down-trend1/)

So lets move onto a wider range and into a bigger down turn for the market.

[You can see chart2 here](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SPY/DZsvUI03-spy2/)

For the long term this does not look good, along with going into an election and the oil industry starting to really feel the pressure. China is starting to crash along with some other small nations going bankrupt. 


I personally dont think we will see a full crash but everyone is scared and they haven't started to sell off in fear yet. Most of the investors in the market are older people that depend on their retirement so they are going to protect it more so.

I love this forum, but lately there's been nothing but doom and gloom, and pointless predictions on where the market is heading.  I thought i'd see what other buy/hold investors are doing these days to take advantage of things.

Through some odd stroke of luck, I actually managed to liquidate a decent portion of my portfolio just prior to the crash, and it was frozen by my broker due several glitches in their system.  Now that it's ""unfrozen,"" I basically have money to play with.

To capitalize on this, I plan on tripling my weekly contributions to my portfolio, with additional entry points when the market dips at least 10% from it's peak.  I only dabble in mutual funds these days (basically vanguard 2045, but I manually allocate to avoid the higher fees).   I'll also add to my position each time the market shifts up by 10%, but by half the amount I would if it had dropped.  I'm debating doing this based on the percentage of the change also, as I saw a good article somewhere that showed a weighted approach was generally better when DCA'ing.

15-08-25,3ied2s,[YOLO] Apple April 2016 calls @$110,"This is more for informationatial purposes since I can't really send myself 10% of the gain, but at the same time, I want to show people what kind of analysis and post I expect.

I recommend Apple April 2016 calls @ a strike of $110, which, tomorrow morning, should go for around $6-7. Apple is trading at a totally silly valuation right now, at a post-cash P/E of 8(!), miles and miles below Google's 22. No matter the way you look at it, Apple is undervalued.

That being said, I still see it dipping below $100 momentarily tomorrow, which should offer the perfect opportunity to grab calls on the cheap. Apple is, simply said, the best stock there ever was, and the drop from the $120 level is a giant joke. Absolutely nothing has changed about Apple since then. Sure, some people mention China, but the fears are grossly overexaggerated. Tim Cook himself said sales were ""the strongest they have been"" in July and August, and guess what's coming in September? Yep.

Apple is bound to go back to $130+, which is still around $50 below its fair value. I think it will set a new all-time high by April 2016, which is why I would not hesitate to buy $110 calls. Here is why:

1) Still crazy big growth. With its Apple Watch, Apple Pay, iTunes Radio, Apple is still churning out growth at an insane speed. 

2) The drop in the market is mostly a joke and manipulation/panic. There is nothing right now that justify any kind of crisis. China might grow at 6.5% instead of 7%, big fucking deal.

3) Apple still has plenty of room to grow in the US. It's still dominating Android on all important metrics (profits, most of all)

4) The Apple Watch will be a massive success this holiday season

5) iTunes is still growing at a 10%+ annual growth rate. It went from being barely a break-even product to highly profitable.

6) I predict the new iPad will lead to a comeback in iPad sales. iPad sales are so low they pretty much can only go up at this point (given the distribution channel Apple now has). Also, the cycle for new iPad is due now.

7) APPLE has a crazy high buyback in place. In fact, I hope the stocks remains so low for good as this will wipe out a large number of shares, leading to a higher EPS. Really, Apple is nearing the 1B share repurchase, WOW.



But all of this is just nitpicking. None of these points even matter when compared to the YOLO point:

YOLO) THE IPHONE 6S!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ITS GOING TO BE CRAZY AWESOME AND AMAZING AND SUPER COOL AND OUTSTANDING AND MAKE APPLE TONS OF MONEY.

The S cycle is usually the most lucrative. I still remember the 4S update when Apple pretty much obliterated every estimate in the world. I think the 6S and 6S+ will pretty much GG all the Apple bears. The 6S will without a doubt be the best sellers in history and it will rake in a massive amount of money for Apple.

Therefore, Apple will spike before or after its JAN 2016 earnings call.

Of course, none of this would matter today if Apple was at $140 per share. But it isn't. I call for the ""mother of all rallies"" when it comes to Apple and a MINIMUM $135 price by next earnings.

For this reason, for a true yolo, go for AAPL April 2016 calls at a strike of $110. IMO there is a 300-400% profit to be made. 

Disclaimer: I plan on buying around 10 of these calls, maybe in batches of 5. Yes, I know, no more 100 calls at a time for me.

Here's my internal struggle. I've been reading a lot about Greece and their current financial struggle. It seems to me that it's just far too difficult for them to be a part of the EU. Using the EURO and not being able to adjust currency power through rates is their downfall. When a country has it's own currency it has more control over shaping it's economic status over time. 

Here's my shot in the dark.
The national bank of Greece (NBG) is priced around 60 cents/share. If Greece can rebound, or at least set up some sort of financial sustainability after a bailout, this could normalize.

I'm gonna start small but to learn to swim you have to jump in the pool one day.  
One problem I encountered is my fairly small knowledge of the trending stocks so I directed myself to stock screener like the google one and I'm looking for some advice on good criteria to reduce the number of corresponding stock.  

Right now I mostly use :  
 - Last price (Since I'm starting small I cannot afford crazy expensive stock but want to avoid penny stock too)  
 - I use 52w price change (as a way to try to select only stocks with a long term growth)  
 - P/E ratio mostly to compare stock from the same domain of expertise  
 - Div yield (Stocks yielfing dividents might be more interesting)

15-08-26,3ieziu,"Drunk, again. Real talk.","Don’t know where to start so I'm just going to dive into it.

The one thing that unites us in WallStreet Bets is that we all want to be rich.  At least once every day you’ll see a post about a yacht.  There is literally no other logical reason that a person would put money in AMD except for the .0001% chance of becoming rich and actually owning a yacht.  This is what I love about this place.  We’re a bunch of hungry mother fuckers willing to take a chance on even the worst of odds because we dream bigger than mediocrity.  

However, we’ve turned the idea of becoming rich into a joke with all these fucking memes.  But it’s not.  Look around.  There’s fucking rich people everywhere.

It is possible.

However, what we’re doing here will never let us realize our dreams.

The problem with trading is that it doesn’t force us to change.  As long as we are capable of depositing money and executing an order, any brokerage would be happy to have our money.  But those in itself does absolutely nothing to help us mature and guide us towards thinking and acting like someone who is wealthy.

So let’s clear somethings up.
The problem is, has been, and always will be YOU.  YOU think the world owes you something.  YOU think everything should be easy and given to you.  YOU blame your boss for how shitty your job is.  YOU blame your parents for not being more financially responsible so they could pay for your college.  YOU blame your spouse for not believing in your dreams.  YOU are the problem, and the good news is that YOU are also the solution.

Again, I am not rich but I’d like to share what I’ve learned these past couple of years.

Trading will not make you rich unless you sell your soul to it and deliberately improve at it for at least two years (probably closer to 5).  Trading is like anything else.  In the beginning it seems easy and simple, then as you try to gain some consistency and become a master at it. it fucks you in the ass.  You have to treat this like a business which is really hard when you’re just sitting in your room with a computer.

I am a firm believer in trading in your spare time when real opportunities present themselves and sticking to something else in the mean time.

If you’re looking to get rich trading you’re going to have a bad time.  If you’re already rich and looking to preserve and grow your wealth then you will have a good time.

We try too hard to force the market to give us what we want, when really we should just be waiting for the market to give to us.

Learn to fuck the market when it bends over and spreads it’s cheeks and screams FREE MONEY but also know when to fuck off because her dad just came home.

You have a better chance of making it as a PGA tour golfer than becoming a successful trader.  So don’t try to be a successful trader.  When you try to look for opportunities every day then you’re fucked.  You go in when you see an opportunity screaming at you to throw money at it or else you’ll regret it for the rest of your life, you don’t just throw money at anything and everything.

I have given the last two years of my life learning about how people become wealthy/successful and after this two year journey, I’m almost in the exact same place.  You read a lot of things, learn a lot of things, but it’s often the first thing you were told that you brush over at the time that comes back and bites you in the ass.

This is what I learned
	⁃	You have to provide value to someone else.  I’ll give you 10 examples in various works of life.  That nice big house you buy is providing you value not just in shelter but it gives you an image of being successful, enough rooms to do whatever you want, room to entertain others, and enough room to let you do your hobbies.  That hot girl across from the bar is providing value to you in that you want to fuck hot girls.  That ugly girl sure as fuck isn’t providing that same value.  Tittleist makes the best golf ball in the entire world, end of story.  Some fucking website I bought a bonsai tree from when I was on LSD provided the best customer service/information for helping a beginner pick out a fucking miniature tree.  Budweiser may not be the best beer, but for the price it’s pretty damn good so that’s where it’s value comes from.  Crest makes the damn best fucking toothpaste.  FUCKING TOOTHPASTE MOTHERFUCKER.  Name one other crayon/colored pencil company besides Crayola.  You can’t BECAUSE YOU DON’T KNOW ANY BITCH.  Your boss didn’t hire you for any other reason besides the fact that they had a need and you fucking filled it.  END OF STORY.  Find a need.  Become the best at filling that need.  Collect cash.  
	⁃	Action&gt;Words/Thoughts.  I don’t care what you think.  I don’t care what you say.  I don’t care what your dreams are.  All I fucking care about is what you do when you wake up in the morning.  Are you grinding or are you on reddit jerking off?
	⁃	Lastly, the holy grail is YOU.  This is something you’ll see a lot if you go on day trading forums and it’s best advice I have ever received in my entire life.  We look for others to solve our problems and make us happy when really you’re the only fucking person that can do that.  Stop waiting until your boss gives you an opportunity or until you meet the right girl or the right business partner or the right friends, YOU are what’s going to determine your success.  If you fail it was your fault, and if you win it was because of you.

Guys, I’m not saying don’t trade and don’t yolo.  I’m saying that if you really want your yacht it’s going to be a lot harder than putting in a limit order.  The one thing that brings us all together is that we want to be rich.  I’m telling you that after a lot of pain and losing money that the market won’t do that.  Success multiplies.  When you become successful at something else you’ll realize what is needed to make money successfully in the market.  The person you are now is not the kind of person that will become rich.

My advice
	⁃	Go to the best college you can at the lowest price you can.  Many private colleges offer huge educational scholarships.  Many state schools are pretty good.  Or go to an ivy if you can because they give their students a lot of money and that’s a real experience that is worth the price.  Why?  A degree is no longer a benefit but a requirement, so you definitely should get one.  College is a nice experience to have fun and make memories.  However, nothing is worth going 100k+ in debt when you’re 18.  If you’re parents are going to pay for it then fuck it go wherever the fuck you want.  But that’s not the reality for most people.  
	⁃	Work.  Become experienced at anything and learn about the problems the customers/business faces then fix it.
	⁃	Save your money.  Seriously.  Save your fucking money.  
	⁃	Wait for the chances when the market says FUCK ME AND TAKE MY MONEY
	⁃	Find someone you really love and friends you really trust.  These are irreplaceable.  
	⁃	Stop all addictions/vices
	⁃	Alcohol, stupid amounts of time watching tv/reddit/netflix/video games/porn, overspending, weed. cigarettes.
	⁃	Look at longer time frames. 90 days/4 hours at the very least preferably 3 years plus.  Start waiting for your trades to form instead of waking up every day saying Ooo this looks nice.  The strategy I gave before in my other thread works about twice every seven years.  The other ones I look at work about once every three months.  

I’m not saying don’t place any more trades, I’m saying become rich a different way and then you can fucking lose it all doing shit WSB tells you to.  Seriously, I’m not saying you can never make a 100%+ gain ever in your life.  I’m saying that those types of opportunities come every once in a while, so you want cash on the side and a job/business to fill your time in the mean time.  Once that chance does come then you go in.

The guy that sells a company for 2 million after 4 years does happen.  The guy that turns 1k into 100k doesn’t happen.  But the guy that turns 2 million into 2.5 million trading/investing does happen.  

Lastly, I’ll give some trading advice because this is a trading subreddit.  WAIT.  We still have no fucking idea if this bull market will keep going or if this is the start to the bear cycle.  WAIT.  Let the trend form and then collect your free money.  I personally think this is the beginning of the end and I am getting ready to short.

TLDR:  If you really want to be rich, transform yourself into a better human being that gives something  of value to the world.",77

15-08-26,3ielck,Options Trading: Strangle/Straddle Into Earnings,"I've been watching weekly options chains during earnings and I've noticed something quite unexpected: For weeklies, the IV% increases for both calls/puts during the week of earnings, and the options prices increase 100%+ for the side that is in favor of the stock movement (i.e. Call contracts increase in price substantially day after earnings if the stock moves sharply upwards). To clarify: I have seen the IV% increase ON THE DAY AFTER earnings when the movement is strong (&gt;8%). This is a literal strangle/straddle into earnings, with the intent of selling the options the day AFTER earnings. The IV crush doesn't seem to affect the weeklies the day after earnings when the stock moves strongly.

This strategy involves purchasing the options within an hour of the close of the day of earnings, and holding overnight to sell the next day. 

Is this a relatively well-known phenomenon? And is a sideways movement the only catch to this strategy? I would imagine for historically volatile earnings stocks (FB, AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, etc.) this would be an excellent approach.",1

Do I sell this mother or ride the CYCC YOLO wave?

Edit: Adding some more info. 

1) They haven't been above a dollar PPS in 2015 and are currently on their 180-day extension with Nasdaq ending in Feb 2016. So yeah they have some time but delisting is on the horizon.

2) There seems to be very little interest in this stock - On the last earnings call there was nothing of significant shared by management and 0 questions asked and volume is very low.

3) The catalyst I see, and what got me interested in the first place, is they have a few things in the pipeline going through R&amp;D, one of which is pretty far along in testing.

So overall, the stock price is low with potentially a lot of upside but I'm not confident in the management team and of course approvals and the FDA are a gamble to begin with.

15-08-26,3if68v,"Made more money recently on the downswing than the up. Here's what I did... Curious why there aren't more stories about it here.","A couple weeks back I just wasn't feeling right about the market, and historically speaking we were entering the worst performing and most volatile part of the year. I started looking at my options of what I could get into. I noticed that the VIX volatility index was at almost record lows... And given the time of year we were entering I thought it might be a decent strategy to hedge my bets with something similar. 

So I bought into a volatility ETN that approximates the VIX fairly well. I bought the equivalent of about 25% of my portfolio. 

As you probably know, volatility has gone through the roof. I recently lost a whole lot of stock value like everyone else who left money in, but my ETN shot so high up that I basically broke even. When the market finally recovers, I think I should be in an even better position. 

It seems to me like the only way to make real money is to play both sides of the coin. I'm considering dabbling in inverse ETFs next (e.g. instruments that go up when the market goes down and vice versa) if it looks like this correction is going to turn into a bear for a while. 

Maybe I've missed it but I don't see a lot of discussion of these types of strategies here on the sub. Thought I'd throw that out there. ",0

Then we saw it rise a bit yesterday as people bought low and saw it dip again as they sold on the bounce. Right now it is up over 250 points. I still think the market is overvalued and will have a correction in September. 

People like using terms they just heard about like Dead Cat Bounce. I have seen it ten times on this sub, usually the same guy is saying it. What you are seeing is not a dead cat bounce because the market will recover before the real correction. It is merely people taking advantage of the panic. Nothing more, nothing less.

-If at the end of 1 year he has $200 or more he keeps all money including my $100  
-If at the end of 1 year he has less than $200 he owes me $200

15-08-26,3ih9fi,"Buying oil down here. Here's why","Oil at 40 bucks a barrel is awful for everybody except oil shorts. Bought USO and CL contracts yesterday and am going to hold for a minimum of 6 months. 

Supply side:
Canada's tar sands, a major source for economic growth are completely unprofitable at these levels. Texas's extraordinary growth over that past decade can be directly attributed to oil plays. There are hundreds of scenarios around the world painting the same story. Even the saudis are in panic mode and are slashing their fiscal budgets so you can kiss their growth goodbye too. I've read so many research notes, especially after the initial crash from 100 to 60, talking about the pure cost of getting it out of the ground. A LOT of firms will have to (and already are) drastically cutting back production. Iran can't keeps pushing oil into the markets forever with their 150 million barrels in reserves. Supply has to come offline. We've seen rig counts absolutely die (~1100-700) and I really do think that we'll see an oil shortage in mid q1 of next year.

Demand: Is global growth slowing? Of course especially in territories that export oil. But deceleration is not the same thing as contraction. China is still growing, regardless of the rate of growth. Our roads have empirically seen record amounts of congestion. For the oil thesis to work, demand doesn't have to even move and I think that accounting for even modest 1% demand growth is (more than fair)[ https://www.iea.org/oilmarketreport/omrpublic/] the United states and European underlying economic stories (while not great) are STABLE. I do think solar with absolutely explode within the next 5 to 7 years which will decimate demand but my position is not a long term hold 

My final opinion:
Oil is not trading on fundamental economics. The hedge funds, institutional guys&amp;gals and the occasional stocktwits yahoo have pushed the price below what is even remotely sustainable in the medium term. It represents a great buying opportunity.",5

15-08-26,3ifi4t,The Emperor Has No Clothes,"So the Chinese have basically thrown the financial equivalent of the kitchen sink at the stock market (trillions of dollars, pensions, media blackout, etc.) The recent moves to devalue the currency, decrease the interest rates, and decrease the reserve requirements, reflects how desperate their situation is. Yet, the efforts so far to stave off the decline is not having any major effect on the overall trend. Anybody who looks at a chart sees that the Shanghai market failed to reach the '07 highs and that was really when the Chinese economy peaked. 

The world markets aren't crashing because the Chinese economy was supporting the world's economy. The focus is on the stock market right now, and the flight to quality includes now dumping stocks and even BBB corporate bonds and going after the safe-haven assets (Treasuries, corporates, etc.). The real problem is debt and dollar liquidity, and it will become more apparent as equities continue to fall.

There is no forcing the market to do what it does. It is a monster that nobody can contain or control or tame. If that were the case, and the conspiracy theorists were right, and the world was run by the rich and powerful, then the Chinese government with trillions of dollars and their arsenal of tools should have been able to abate the selloff in the market.

Not even the Federal Reserve has this perceived omnipotent power. They are unable to control the day-to-day trading of US bonds, especially considering many are in the hands of foreigners. There was a flash crash in the Treasury market in October 2014, and after a 72-page report they could not find a single cause for the incident. They have no control over what's going on in the bond or stock markets.

Here's the truth: the emperor has no clothes. There is very little the Fed can do here. They need to raise rates to save the pensions, but the other countries will be hurt because of the $9tn in dollar-denominated bonds that will suddenly cause the debts of these nations to become expensive. Brazil, Europe, China, etc. So the Fed is in a bind...do what's right domestically, or hold off on the rate hike to support the rest of the world? Fact is, there is no exit strategy on how to unwind the balance sheet acquired through the QE programs, there is no plan on how to raise rates gradually, there is no plan about how to handle the bond markets and lack of dollar liquidity.

Whereas the likes of [Apple](https://au.finance.yahoo.com/q?p=finance.yahoo.com&amp;s=AAPL) who I'm sure you all know more about than Spark, was seeing record highs earlier in the year, has dropped right down in price and can get picked up for a bargain (dependent on your beliefs on China and its relationship with Apple).

15-08-26,3ifudw,Is a bubble bursting? Or is a market trend ending?,"I'm trying to compare the market today to the market in 1999 when the tech bubble popped with a loud bang.  I see a lot of parallels between China's bubble market and the U.S. tech bubble from roughly 1995 to 1999.  So why is the U.S. market so turbulent?  Is it because a huge portion of our economy relies on China?  If we stipulate that China's bubble is deflating with loud fart-like noises, just how far will this deflate the U.S. market?

I'm looking for another 15% off of China and about 6 to 7 percent more off the U.S. market.  This is within the next 2 months and highly likely to hit in October.  Why?  Because China's bubble is still super inflated.  The earnings picture and the value model of their economy says they need to shed at least 15% more to get to a point where investors will see value.  The U.S. would reach that point with another 6 or so percent.

Apparently this Friday is the deadline to see if they are compliant to stay on Nasdaq or not. If they are pushed to the pinks, the dream is dead and they are going to take it private. 

I'm thoroughly confused as to wtf management is actually doing. I can't get over the fact that they PR'd the ever living fuck out of the offering, yet haven't broadcast anything positive. To me, that seems as if they are intentionally tanking the SP. 

There has been a pretty large sum of money injected recently, and over $200m in the last few years. Why would someone as business savvy as Noubar keep pumping money into a depreciating asset? I don't believe he would, considering his track record. 

So basically- either myself and a few others are completely and utterly fucked, or BG comes out with something clutch that will save the day. 

This week is really a deciding factor- if they remain compliant and actually PR it, things could be turning around. If they are compliant and barely make a peep about it, that's definitely a bad sign.  Pinks will equate to death, but the 2nd indication and revs are around the corner.

15-08-26,3ifwt8,Timeline of contango effect on USO oil ETF,"I took a moderate-sized long position in USO sometime in March, just before it started climbing back into the 20s for a while. I was loving the low price of crude, thought for sure I had secured a great deal on a long-term commodities play and that I'd let it just sit in my portfolio for years. Unfortunately I didn't know about contango.

(For those who are unfamiliar, contango is when futures prices slope upwards as you go farther out in time, and as I learned it's a major, major risk in holding commodities ETFs based on futures contracts for the long term. So USO is having to pay more for less as its contracts expire, causing the ETF's NAV to depreciate.)

I found this article which shows that it doesn't look like the futures curve for oil is too steep (chart at the bottom).

http://www.cmegroup.com/education/featured-reports/super-contango-and-the-bottom-in-oil-prices.html

So needless to say that's not my favorite position in my portfolio right now, but I'm not sure whether contango is reason enough to sell that position into this awful market. The possibility of $30 oil over the next 9 to 12 months is pretty daunting knowing now that contango's just going to eat away at my return the longer I hold it.

Can anyone help give me some perspective on the contango factor here - how bad did I screw up?",6

After some pretty substantial research [\(this really helped\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3ifwt8/timeline_of_contango_effect_on_uso_oil_etf/cug6bad)

I have concluded that obviously USO and UWTI are in a contango, and the future contracts are bound to bring negative returns.

My next action i think is with ERX, this is because it is the energy sector, not just oil, and companies $CVX and $XOM are within this ETF. I would assume my time horizon is 1 year+.



My only concern is that the ETF is composed as follows...

Index Sector Weightings (%) 	
 
Oil, Gas &amp; Consumable Fuels 	81.49%

Energy &amp; Equipment Services 	18.51%

Which makes me weary of that 80% consumable fuels making a long term increase due to this contango effect.

Where is the additional funding going to come from and how much is it going to dilute existing S/H?

AMDA is still rolling out products and R&amp;D is only the first step on a long road when selling surgical implants. They need a huge rep network out there pounding the pavement and educating surgeons in order to raise awareness and gain market share. Unless it is shoved down their throat, surgeons are going to stick with what they know because it's the safe option.

And after watching them somewhat closely just to try and learn I've started wondering how you could really go wrong?

It's not like the stock market ever just ends so even if I bought high and my stock went down the next week, month, or year this is the excact opposite time to sell like the others? Maybe I'm missing something but say I bought stock in a major company that looks to be growing quickly like Amazon or even an older company like ford they could almost never end because they would get bailed out since they employee so many. Yes there stock may go down for a year or 2 or even 3 but it's got to go back up right? So me being young I could buy a few of these companies stocks and either sell whichever stock has grown when I need money if I'm buying something like a house/car and then keep another stock that may be having a bad year...

The only things I could think flawed  with this idea is just because the stock went up doesn't mean it was worth it with inflation? Or if you were older or in a situation you would need the money a certain time? Or obviously I could be way wrong and companies actually often end up never coming back from a stock falling?

Since I am investing mostly in passive ETFs, my current solution to avoid half of the dividend withholding tax is to invest in funds domiciled in Ireland, traded on the London stock exchange. This limits the dividend taxation on, for instance, an S&amp;P 500 ETF to 15%.

I am fortunate enough to live in a country with 0% withholding and capital gains tax, and would like to benefit from this as much as possible.

1. Am I right in thinking that I could lower the dividend tax to 0%, if I find and invest in a US-based ETF that reinvests dividends?

I am looking to find some beta users for a new product Essentia Note, a cloud based journalling software that will be released early next year.

This product has been developed alongside our existing analytics platform www.essentia-analytics.com and is an online journalling tool that enhances the investment process by keeping a record of the investment decisions you make. As well as being a central place to gather ideas and stay organised, Essentia Note also is also used in the review process, overlaying decision timing and ideas on underlying equity price charts. This helps to maintain discipline and ultimately achieve better performance. 

Over the next few weeks will be looking for a limited amount of users for our closed Beta which will start mid Oct and last for 3 months. Within this time users will have full access to the Essentia Note platform and all we would ask is for regular feedback on how the platform feels and any great ideas you may have to enhance our product. 

All the data will be very secure and will held by us securely using Amazon's servers giving you world class protection of your information.

There is no cost for the Beta and if you should accept then as a thank you for your participation we would be glad to offer a 1 year free access once the product is launched in full.

I hope you see this as an exciting opportunity to help mould a potential global product which will be used by both institutional and private investors.

Then, if you have lots of money you buy/sell stocks/ETFs. If you don't then seperate your portfolio into 4 even piles and buy greater than 3 week puts/calls on stocks/etfs that have upcoming catalysts. 

After the catalyst, exit your positions no matter what, unless another catalyst is coming. Be disciplined in this and start learning to make smarter bets, over time you will make money. #smartYoloing",38

At the end of the year some of the Mutual Funds I am invested in pay out dividends and both short and long term capital gains.  Besides the difference in tax rates for capital gains and dividends, is there any difference?  

Example:

I set my profile to auto-invest dividends and capital gains.  I own 10 shares of a mutual fund at $10 a share.  Let’s say the company pays out year-end dividends at  $1 a share, long term capital gains at $3 a share and short term capital gains at $2 a share.   Would I now own 25 shares at $4 a share.  

So besides the different tax treatment can capital gain payouts be thought of as dividends?

I'm considering investing in some companies that I don't know many of their fundamentals or news.  Even if I did I'd only be guessing at what to do with the information.  Basically, I know I'm not an expert.

But what I do know about these companies is that: 

1. They all have market caps 40B+
2. Managed by superstars from what I know
3. From what I see from personal experience, they're very focused on growing and monopolizing their areas.
4. I don't see them disappearing in the next 10 or 20 years.  

Basically, is this enough information to make a decent long-term (to very long-term) buy-and-hold?  Is it necessary to know specifics of things like their margins, their earnings reports, or anything?  Or can I make some blanket assumptions that they're profiting... and profiting enough.

I put 500 into two etfs on the ftse, charged £11 each time. I'm wondering what kind of size investment makes the fees less impact ul? Should I try to put 1k at a time in each? Or is it more like 4-5k? It also limits what I can do with regards to Dca rather than LsF. I just wanted to get 1k in to get started, but if the market drops more I'd like to take advantage over coming months. Obv investing at 700 ish a time is hurting with the fees (I think?) so what kind of size should I aim to put in next? For example let's say next month the ftse is at 5700, should I put a few grand in each etf? Hope this makes sense, I'm in for long term obvs and next April will want to start contributing to a stocks shares isa for tax free allowance (have a 4 yr fixed isa with 15240 in atm maxed).

15-08-27,3imcyn,Sell or Hold Heuristics: why I sometimes sell a loss making stock below fair value,"A common quandary investors face is whether to sell or hold a negative position. The usual response is ""sell it if you wouldn't buy it here"". I would like to put forth an alternative that I use in making hat decision. It's based on the next most attractive opportunity.


The basic principle is; if I can get a higher annualised rate of return by recycling that capital in another name, I would sell the position at a loss even if it's undervalued.


Because the sale generates a tax loss, this is the formula you can use to calculate a sell or hold value.


      Sell or Hold? = ((1+ (expected gain on hold/original investment)) ^ (1/t) - 1) - (1+((0.5*loss + expected gain on alternative - commissions)/(original investment)) ^ (1/t) -1)


Where; 

- t = the time, in years, you intended to hold the original position.
- expected gain = gap to fair value


If the result of that equation is positive, hold the position, if it's negative, I should sell the position at a loss even if the stock itself is undervalued. An alternative strategy would be to sell the position at a loss and buy a far out call on the current holding.

I unfortunately had to sit on about $25k of cash due to certain life events and I am now fortunately free of those events and can therefore free up this cash.

I’m a novice at this, but my best educated guess for my next step would be one of the following options:

* Increase my contribution to max and live off the excess cash rather than income

* Dump $11k into two IRAs (married) to invest immediately and try to pump as much into the 403b as possible while drawing down the cash

I’m honestly split between the two options (especially considering the recent correction) so I’m wondering if there is something I’m not considering that should affect my decision. Or something else I should do entirely. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

Btw, a bit of background, I’m not maxing out my 403b yet and I haven’t touched my IRA yet either. Hence why I’ve been able to store up the cash. I also have a $10k emergency fund, $20k in student loans at 5.5%, no CC or other debt, solid job and field, and no plans for large purchases in the next couple years (house, car, etc.).

15-08-27,3ijf0m,Considering a bond ladder. Pros/Cons vs Bond Index?,"A primer: I am helping to advise my parents on their 401k holdings.  They were holding cash throughout the whole recent boom over the past several years, and only recently have I been able to step in and try to provide some assistance.  Luckily, they have the means to live off of dividends from other investments, therefore my priority with this particular account is preservation of capital with lower risk growth as the objective.  They are in their early 60s and relatively healthy.

Currently we own AGG and LQD as our bond allocations in the retirement account, however it has not been doing very well recently, and also I am worried about a rising interest rate environment over the coming years (and decades).  We will not be using the bond yields for living income, we are simply using them to diversify risk away from being purely in stocks.

Now, I am OK with buying a bond, CD, or whatever, and holding it to maturity.  Therefore I am considering a bond ladder.  As I understand it, if you have the patience to hold to maturity, you get your principal back (assuming of course the creditor still exists).  To me, this seems like the way to go over holding a bond index, the price of which varies inversely with yield.  By holding the ladder bonds to maturity, you are essentially immune to this effect unless you need to liquidate early, is that correct?

So, I'd like to allocate equal amounts to bonds maturing in 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years.  When the 1 year bond expires, buy another 5 year, and so on until we own all 5 years with annual rolling maturity dates.  That way we get into to the higher yielding long term bonds for all the bonds we own.

Is there anything special I should know, or am overlooking?  Assuming all bonds are held to maturity, it appears that one achieves perfect preservation of capital (again, assuming the creditor is still there), while still benefiting from a rising rate environment.  Since you buy new bonds every year, you benefit from any interest rate hikes.

Any categories I should avoid?  Will I generally be OK as long as I stick with AA- and above?  Or is that too low?  With localities and cities claiming bankruptcy, should we avoid muni bonds?  And also, since this is a 401k, we should be ok purchasing taxable bonds, yes?  Is there any benefit to a bond fund like AGG besides liquidity?

Would you also suggest a CD ladder in a similar vein due to the added reassurance of FDIC insurance?  Rates seem somewhat similar, to be honest.  But I know the penalty for an early out is likely higher in the CD.

Thanks a lot!  Bonds are all very new to me, but I'm learning!",6

Newbie to the Stock Market.

Anyways, I've been looking at a few stocks with dividends, and I'm not looking for extremely pricey stocks because I'd like to be able to buy multiple shares at a time (yes, I'm ok with waiting 1 or 2 paychecks between stock purchases)

I've been looking at:  
Navios Maritime Midstream Partners LP (NYSE: NAP), the outlook seems fairly stable, has OK dividend yield and it looks like they are turning a profit last year into this year....

Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F), they've been growing for the most part in stock price, over the last three years.... the thing that worries me though is the EPS is falling each quarter since 2013, the net income is also falling each quarter... but the DPS keeps going up each quarter... I'm curious what everyone's thoughts are on F for sure...

Advanced Semiconductor Engineering Inc. (ASX: NYSE), they seem to be coming off a big hike up to about 7.50 range and is seeming to settle around $5; Their revenue is climbing and is up 16%, net income fell from 2010 to 2011, but is climbing over the last few years, and their dividend is nearly as much as their stock price right now.... which again, is interesting. 

NVIDIA Corp   (NVDA: NASDAQ), Nvidia has had decent revenue throughout the last few years and is only continuing in an upward slope, the net income is slightly down for the last quarter, but it's been pretty strong still, and they only seem to be adding more to their Dividends nearly each quarter, which are now at $0.35 per share. 

Currently, I'm only holding a small amount of shares in AMD and FCEL, but it appears that both are not really going anywhere, and AMD seems like it's just not able to compete anymore, even though I love AMD....  It seems that AMD is more of a broken company, more than a broken stock...

I think that it has been beaten down by low commodities prices and a pull back in the spending of mining companies. But JOY seems to have all of the indicators of a value investment.  
The only concern I see is that they have a higher debt ration then I'd like, given that there are still a fought few months ahead, and I wonder about the sustainability of their dividend over the next year. 
What say you friends?",4
15-08-26,3iixbw,"Instead of buying commodities, invest in companies in the sector?","I think commodities are a good buy right now. But instead of buying commodities directly, wouldn't it be wiser to invest in companies in the given sector whos trading value is dependent on the commodity? The main reasoning here is that commodities don't pay dividends. Commodities are unproductive assets, meaning they don't generate any kind of cash flow to the investor and are only worth what someone will pay for it. Investing in companies, however, gives you the added benefit of accruing dividends. 

Take silver, for example, which is at a 5-year low. As a commodity, it's trading for around $455/kg, down from its 2011 peak of $1,500 and slightly up from its 2008/2009 bottom of $300. If you look at some of the biggest companies by market cap in the silver sector (here: https://biz.yahoo.com/p/135mktd.html) you will see that all of the companies have a strong relationship with the price of silver, and their company's stock follows the same trading trends. If we look at Silver Wheaton Corp. (SLW), the largest company in the silver sector by market cap, we see their chart closely follows silver. However, SLW's 2011 high of $43.50 was up over 1,200% from its 2008/2009 low of $3.50, while silver was only up 300% from 2008 to 2011 ($450 - $1,500). In addition to this, you're getting yearly dividends from the equities that you aren't getting from the commodities. 

I'm sure this is a common conversation, so what's the consensus on investing in the companies over the commodities? I understand the companies are more likely to be more volatile and there's always a risk of ruin (company going under) as opposed to the commodities themselves, but if you look through the companies in the silver sector, they have almost all outperformed silver historically. It seems like a better bet to just invest in the most solid, undervalued silver company than the commodity itself.",9

To me, Fitbit's portfolio of products is a completely different market than the Apple Watch, both in in target market and price, and it's frustrating to me that FIT's stock is hinging on the comparison to Apple Watch. Now, one can argue that the market of fitness trackers as wearables is shrinking as a result of full blown smart watches but to me they will always be separate markets in the same way that tablets are to laptops.

15-08-27,3ijl8g,Inherited IRA,"I apologize if this is a long read, but it's something I have been worrying about. 

The IRA is controlled by the adviser that my father had chosen before he passed away, and rolled over to my mother. When my mother passed away in 2013, I inherited the IRA from my mother. According to IRS rules, this IRA must be fully dispersed in 5 years. 

2013 and 2014 went well. In August of 2014 the account had grown by 14%. In December of 2014, a realignment was performed after a 7% drop. The realignment failed to take advantage of the market increases in the Spring as many of the funds suffered from being associated with the oil and natural gas industries (pipelines, ng and oil transportation companies, etc). The account had fallen back to where we originally began after my mother had passed away. All of the gains that were in the account are gone, and now with the activity of the past week (including the gains today), I'm staring at -7% since 2013. 

My adviser's group has recently switched affiliations and my accounts moved from IC to TD Ameritrade. The changes in control happened on Monday (after two weeks of paper work being shuffled) and I called TD Ameritrade to set up my log in to keep track of my account today. $10k is still sitting in a MMF waiting to be used for purchasing and the other stocks are exactly the same as they were. I have placed two calls to my adviser this week and I know it's been very hectic, but I haven't gotten a reply. I need to know what his strategy will be going forward and that he doesn't plan to just sit back and wait. I wish he would be proactive in using the $10k and look for a selling point to unload some of the undesirable stock that is lagging the portfolio. What I would like to know is should I yell at him, and at what point should I take my account elsewhere?",1

So.... how to make money on this?

The trade thesis is extremely simple:  buy a 3x pro-something and a 3x inverse-something.  Wait for the market to crash.  Cash out your 3x inverse-something (trading won't be halted for gains excess of 20%).  Immediately dump everything into the 3x pro-something fund until it stops trading.... wait for the back-out bounce and liquidate at an additional profit.  Basically it's a formula for 25% to 35% gains.

The only significant ""trick"" is figuring out when to liquidate the 3x inverse and throw it in the 3x pro fund (can't be triggered by the circuit breaker and needs to happen before the trade queues become saturated). ...oh, and waiting for market crashes to happen.",3

Plus I was going to buy extra to take advantage of the correction. I wanted to do this at the end of day so my VTI sale price was as close to the NAV as possible.

I sold the VTI as the market was dipping on 8/25 at end-of-day.  I purchased the VTSAX at 3:50PM.  Turns out, Vanguard's purchase cutoff time is 2:30PM.  So my transaction went through today with a NAV up 3.65%.  A $550 lesson.

Next time I'll do it a little different - if it's late in the trading day, buy just the extra shares of the mutual fund and hold the current shares of the ETF to minimize the change in my exposure. If it's early, place the fund order early and then a market order near the close.

Sucked to be under-exposed during a 3.5% rally. I maximized my loss perfectly! Thankfully the rest of my total stock shares were still in play so those recovered the 3.5%.

15-08-27,3ikdnj,Is the Dow Jones a mathematically sound concept?,"I came across a comment undermining the credibility of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) today. It claimed that the price-weighting meant that the index value misrepresented its underlying assets because share price is not directly proportional to market capitalization and said that it did not take into account the number of shares.

I did some research and I'm finding some conflicting views. Originally the Dow was just the average of the stock prices, which is obviously flawed in the modern stock market. But now the total share prices are divided by some value in order to compensate for splits, etc.

Is this value a weighted average based purely on the number of shares? Does this ""offset"" the price-weighting so that the concept of the index is mathematically sound? Can anyone summarize the complaints I've seen, or explain why the Dow is not a good indicator of the economy besides of course the fact that it contains only 30 companies which obviously don't perfectly represent the economy at large?",5
15-08-27,3incns,VIX is in backwardation,"[VIX futures curve](http://i.imgur.com/0yOkUHx.png)

I don't usually see this -- usually short vol is the positive carry side of the trade. Anyone with more experience trading vol have a sense of how common this is and how persistent it tends to be? 

I'm still selling, betting on reversion in implied vol. I guess everyone else is thinking the same thing, and that's why it's backwardated? 
_____

edit to add: 

**Disclaimer**: Selling vol is the archetypal ""picking up nickels in front of a steamroller"" strategy. Sometimes it's worth it (I think it's worth it *to me*, *right now*, and *at the size I'm doing it*), but it very much can blow up in your face -- in particular, 80% drawdowns in short vol ETFs like XIV are not that uncommon. Use extreme caution. I do not recommend vol-selling for anyone who doesn't already know all this.

15-08-27,3ikk5k,Building three fund portfolio question,"33/M New investor here with all my ducks in a row and finally ready to start putting some money away for retirement (25-30 year investment). Employer has no 401k option, so all my retirement planning is on my wife and I to plan for. I recently opened an IRA account with Vanguard to start this journey.

I've been looking at options between just dumping everything into a target retirement fund or into Vanguards LifeStrategy growth fund. However, building a three fund portfolio is very appealing to have a bit more control over my allocation as well as to eventually qualify for Admiral shares and get a lower expense ratio. Three of the funds I have looked into are:

* Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSMX)
* Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund (VGTSX)
* Vanguard Total Bond Market Fund (VBMFX)

Each of those three has a $3,000 minimum. How or what is the best way to get a three fund portfolio when I can only contribute $5,500 a year to my IRA? Do I just buy one of them each year? If so, do I then use the other $2,500 and maximize the contribution to one fund completely? Or invest the other $2,500 into the LifeStrategy or Target retirement fund and then once I have all three funds, liquidate those to reinvest back into the three funds?
Or would I be better off to just buy the LifeStrategy or Target Retirement Fund now and build it up until I have enough invested in my IRA to purchase all three funds at once?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

15-08-27,3innbn,A question about $SIRI [SiriusXM],"I bought this stock at 3.75 awhile back, I've seen it reach its 52 week high and I did not sell. My question today is in regards to Howard sterns huge contract. As some of you may or may not know, Howard was signed to Sirius before it merged with XM when Sirius only had 600,000 subscribers. The contract was for 500 million for 5 years (back in 2005, he renewed in 2010 for $400M for 5 years) and in a few months he will announce if he will renew it again. Chances are that he will not renew his contract.. 

Basically a few months after Howard was on Sirius, they had a few million subscribers. This shows how big of an audience Howard brought. Do you investors think $SIRI will see a strong hit if Howard does not renew because of the large amount of subscribers that will cancel? Or, could this be good for  Sirius because they open up 400 million dollars to spend elsewhere ?

I hope to sell the stock before the announcement happens, but I wanted to get advice from more experienced investors.",1

The reason for that? The bank is not lending out the money or doing ""fractional reserve banking"" in any form. The only source of income for this bank is fees, and the fees are high. In other words, I don't feel like this bank is going bancrupt anytime soon, it's the kind of bank where personally I feel safe to hold a 7-fig amount even in cash (which I did in the beginning).

Regarding the fees:
When I'm investing in US stock with this bank, I end up with nearly 2% of fees.
There is a nearly $2000 annual flat fee, a ~0.30% annual account ""flat fee"", nearly 1% fee on US stock purchases (one time), an additional 0.25% annual fee for the ""stock account"", and in case I invest in the S&amp;P their own fund/ETF ticket is taking another 0.35%.

Is this rubbish? The bank itself advises me against a dollar-cost-averaging approach in order to minimize fees.
If this is unreasonable, then what is reasonable?, and is it really ""sane"" to have a larger amount (lower 7-figure) with some random broker like e.g. Interactive Brokers?

Out of curiosity, how are hedge funds or rich people doing it? Are they just accepting counterparty risk and deposting it all with chase?

**EDIT** I have a mandate with the bank, they are managing everything for me. is 2% reasonable in this case?",0

Sure, there's a lot of garbage on the chinese stock market. But it doesn't mean there are a LOT of gems. My top two picks for China today are BABA and BIDU.

* BABA is massively oversold at this point (down nearly 50% from its top) despite showing crazy growth that is not expected to slow down anytime soon. Options are expensive, so I would go long 100 shares.

* BIDU is the chinese google. It's not exactly a BABA, but it's the chinese google. Enough sold. At such a low price, it's quite the grab. Since this is a swing stocks, I like far-away OTM calls a lot.

Don't follow the trend. It's time to start betting on Chinese equities again. If anything, chinese stocks should hit 3,500 soon, just because government. The only negative: a strong USD hurts these companies a lot. You could hedge your positions on the forex, I guess.

Summary

On Monday, August 24th, the Fed injected $18.54 billion from a ""reverse repo fund"" filled with cash accumulated at the end of QE3.

The $18.54 billion was exponentially greater than what has been previously needed to stabilize stock prices.

On Monday &amp; Tuesday, primary dealers failed to move stocks up, because overhead resistance was too strong, and a tactical retreat left the DOW down by a combined 793 points.

On Wednesday, the Fed added $4.446 billion, and combined with a mildly positive durable goods report, the primary dealers succeeded in pushing the DOW upward by an astounding 620 points.

A September rate hike is off the table, but soon the Fed will have to accept a huge drop in stock prices or a return to money printing.

There was a time, pre-2007, when the Fed could move the DOW up or down by 100-200 points merely by injecting or withdrawing a few hundred million dollars. The idea of injecting a whopping $18.54 billion, in one single day, was something that would have been impossible to imagine. Times change...

On Monday, August 24, 2015, the Fed injected more than $18 billion dollars. In spite of that, the DOW dropped by 588 points, and by the end of trading on Tuesday, it was down a combined 793 points for the two days. What I am talking about? I am talking the sudden failure of the traditional methods that the Federal Reserve uses to control the behavior of millions of investors.

How they injected new money into the market, without actually printing any new money yet, requires a discussion of the little known concept of something called ""TOMOs"" and ""REVERSE TOMOs"". At the end of QE3, the Fed collected just over $100 billion of the then-newly-printed dollars into a fund composed of ""REVERSE TOMOs"". As you will see, REVERSE TOMOs work exactly opposite to the manner in which TOMOs work. So, to avoid confusing you, I must get into a discussion of what these two things are.

The Fed has been pushing markets upward by actively printing a lot of money ever since 2001. The first phase of the printing extravaganza was not called ""QE"" because, theoretically, the money that was printed was not permanent. Non-permanent money printing is called a ""temporary open market operation"" a/k/a ""TOMO"" a/k/a ""repo transaction"". ""QE"" is something different. It is officially known as a ""permanent open market operation"" a/k/a ""POMO"". To understand what I am talking about, I have to start talking about an area of finance which is somewhat confusing.

TOMOs, or ""repo loans"" can be thought of as a type of temporary QE. The central bank prints up a quantity of money, usually at the request of its primary dealers, the dealers take the money, and they hand over bonds in return. The money is used for whatever the big banks want to use it for. In practical terms, it is used for influencing stock, bond and commodity price both up and down, depending on Fed policy.

Another transaction, used by the Fed and its dealers is the so-called ""reverse repo"" or ""REVERSE TOMO"". In this type of operation, the central bank hands back the bonds, and the primary dealers hand back the money. The process of using TOMO and REVERSE TOMOs to move prices involves catalysis, rather than brute force. Neither the Federal Reserve, nor any other central banker for that matter, has the resources to fight the entire market.

Careful coordinated use of cash, however, can catalyze changes in market pyschology, and that is often enough to change momentum. The primary dealers use the cash to basically ""paint the tape"", so that patterns are created which provide buy and sell signals to other investors. This allows the Fed to move markets broadly up and down.

Unlike the case with outright QE (POMO's), primary dealers are actually supposed to pay back TOMOs. The repayment myth is why very few people screamed and yelled, between 2001 and 2007, when this method of money printing was the primary one used to fund a rising stock market, and between 2007 and 2009 to slow down the collapse. It was much less controversial than QE because, theoretically, when the money is repaid, it disappears from the system.

Theory, however, often doesn't work in practice, as we'll discuss in a moment. But, before we get into the repayment issue, it is worth a look at how the Fed describes the process:

Among the tools used by the Federal Reserve System to achieve its monetary policy objectives is the temporary addition or subtraction of reserve balances via repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements in the open market. These operations have a short-term, self-reversing effect on bank reserves.

It is hard to remember all the various names for these transactions. Remember, that a ""repurchase agreement"" results in a TOMO, and a ""reverse repurchase agreement"" results in a REVERSE TOMO. The idea that these ""loans"" are ""self-reversing"" is deceptive. It is only true if they are repaid in a timely manner. If not, the end result is the same as outright QE. Between 2001 and 2007, TOMOs and REVERSE TOMOs were used as a primary method of pushing markets up and down.

As you may note from the quote, the Fed alleges that the loans are ""overnight"", implying they are paid back the next day. That cannot be further from the truth. Almost every morning, going back several decades, the Fed has kept itself very busy, by making new ""loans"" as great or greater than the ones before. The primary dealers repay the first ""loan"" with the second, the second with the third, and so on and so forth.

The bottom line is that the Federal Reserve does not get paid back for these allegedly ""overnight"" loans on the next day. Instead, they get renewed by the issuance of new loans, day after day, week after week, and month by month. That way, the dealers can carry out Fed policy until they can finally make money off the money by pressuring markets in the desired direction.

The Fed balance sheet shows an ever-growing balance of repo ""loans"" given out between 2001 and 2009. Eventually, they amounted to a running balance of hundreds of billions of dollars, constantly rolled over at maturity for almost a decade. It was essentially a Ponzi scheme, except that the central bank was running it, so it could never break down. Instead, it facilitated an endless expansion of the money supply. This manifested mainly in asset inflation, but was also paid for by commodity inflation during the first decade of the 21st century.

According to the Federal Reserve website:

The Fed uses repurchase agreements, also called ""RPs"" or ""repos"", to make collateralized loans to primary dealers. In a reverse repo or ""RRP"", the Fed borrows money from primary dealers. The typical term of these operations is overnight, but the Fed can conduct these operations with terms out to 65 business days.

Remember, repurchase agreements are TOMOs. ""Collateralized"" is a fancy way of saying that bonds are posted before the Fed gives out the cash. On maturity, the dealers are theoretically supposed to take their bonds back. But, between 2001 and 2009, the Federal Reserve's balance sheet showed an ever-ballooning mass of repo loans. The loans were never paid back. They were simply renewed, over and over and over again.

The running total of hundreds of billions in repo loans was finally repaid ONLY when the primary dealers received newly printed cash when the Fed started admitted to doing permanent cash printing (""QE""). This gradual process began in March 2009. You can review the entire history of the Fed's repo injections, a/k/a ""temporary open market operations"" a/k/a ""TOMOs"" here.

When you compare each TOMO to the movement of the DOW, S&amp;P500 and NASDAQ, you will find a very strong correlation between large cash TOMO injections and ""up"" days. The ""T"" in TOMO stands for temporary, even though the loans are more or less permanent gifts. As with POMOs (QE), money is printed, and, as with POMOs (QE) there is an excellent correlation between injection of cash and a rise in stock and bond prices. The correlation is not perfect, of course, because other factors, like a fantastic news day, can offset the need to inject new money, or even allow some to be taken out.

Once QE began, the TOMO process became irrelevant, and was eventually phased out, because the primary dealers no longer needed them. The process of open and obvious money printing provided them with a permanent source of ready cash, and a market for bonds that could not be profitably sold into the free market. The primary dealers have been very successful in using both the TOMOs and the POMOs to catalyze upward movement in stock and bond markets.

In light of that success, retail investors returned to the market, en masse, during the last phase of QE3. In the midst of that euphoria, not all the printed money needed to be injected right away, and the Fed did some REVERSE TOMOs, holding back some of the newly printed QE money, putting together a sort of emergency reserve fund. Remember, REVERSE TOMOs are the opposite of TOMOs. Money was printed in the POMO (QE) process, and then, because it wasn't needed immediately, it was taken back in the REVERSE TOMO process.

In the end, a fund was created that is essentially a collection of surplus cash, left over from QE3. The existence of this pool of money has allowed the Fed to operate in markets, over the last year, injecting and remove liquidity, without being accused of money printing. Remember, in a TOMO, the Fed takes in bonds and gives out cash. In a REVERSE TOMO, it takes in cash and gives out bonds. Again, if you look at the history, on the days the Fed was accumulating the reverse repo cash fund, stocks mostly went down. Whenever the Fed releases cash from the fund, stocks mostly go up or stabilize if they are going sharply down.

The ""REVERSE TOMO RESERVE FUND"", as I will call it, is a running balance of REVERSE TOMOs, amounting to somewhere between $65 and $120 billion dollars depending on the day. Remember, the fund is composed of REVERSE TOMOs, not TOMOs. Therefore, when the size of the fund goes down, it means that the Fed has injected cash into the system. Similarly, when the size of the fund increases, it means the Fed has taken cash out.

When you look at the numbers, remember one critical point. REVERSE TOMOs operate in exactly the opposite way the TOMOs did during the period 2001 to 2007. The fund that is being deployed is not made up of newly printed cash. It is made up of excess money that was printed up at the end of QE3 but not used back then. The Fed reacts to falling markets by releasing cash from the fund.

Take a look at the history and you'll quickly discover that stock prices rise when cash is released (the REVERSE TOMO dollar amount will fall as a result) and stock prices fall when cash is taken back into the fund (the REVERSE TOMO dollar amount will rise when cash is taken back). The end result has been to stabilize the stock market at approximately the same level as a year ago. This convinced the average Joe Investor that the good times are here to stay.

Unfortunately, times change. There has never been a successful centrally planned economy in the history of the world. It didn't work for the old Soviet Union, and it won't work for America. The intense effort to micromanage the American economy, undertaken over a period of several decades, is also due to fail. It is only a question of when, not if.

In ""olden times"" (pre-2008), injection in the range of $23 billion would catalyze a massive 2,000 point ""up"" day on the DOW. That's why it was never done. But, now, the Fed is dealing with the implosion of a boom set into motion by a credit bubble it created. It is a whole new ballgame. The dealers and the Federal Reserve, however, seem to have underestimated how much money they needed to reserve, at the end of QE3, in their ""Reverse Repo Reserve Fund"". They also seem to have underestimated the amount of cash it would take to change the market's momentum this past Monday and Tuesday.

In spite of injecting $23 billion, the DOW (NYSEARCA:DIA) still collapsed by 588 points, S&amp;P500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) by 78 points, and the NASDAQ (NASDAQ:QQQ) by 170. It was not a total failure. Not yet. Remember, on Monday, the DOW was down by 1,078 at one point. It closed down only 588 points. It was fascinating to watch the events unfold. In the early morning, stocks plummeted in almost a straight line. Then, as banks anticipated receipt of the cash, typically delivered at 1:15 pm, stocks recovered.

Stocks reached a peak around the exact time the money was delivered by the Fed. But, when the money actually arrived, the ""buyers"" began trying to sell. Closing long positions in an orderly manner is essential for the success of a upwardly bound market manipulation. It could have been done, if the dealers had been able to create such chaos. But, it didn't work. Stocks began to head downward again.

In the first part of the last half hour of trading, the longs (I surmise that they are the primary dealer controlled hedge funds) seemed to make a last-ditch effort to catalyze upward momentum. Yet, in an intensely negative sentiment situation, one must quickly sell long positions, or risk getting stuck with big losses. The buyers seemed to try desperately to cover longs before the end of the trading day.

It didn't work again. Once the longs tried to sell, stocks raced down in the last 10 minutes or so of the trading day. It was fairly obvious on Tuesday, the next day, that the Fed was far from finished. The dealers may have staged a tactical retreat on Monday, but they were armed and ready. The futures market was bid up heavily in the early morning hours, and that the indexes were looking spectacular.

As the cash market began trading, however, sellers took over again. The intensity of the selling ended up foiling the longs. Again, the attempt to catalyze upward market movement failed. The DOW ended up down by 205 points. On Wednesday, with the addition of another $4.446 billion in ammunition from a reduction in the reverse repo fund, they finally found success.

The day started off well, with some good news about durable goods. Then, various voting members of the FOMC began telling the public that a September rate hike was ""less compelling"". The combination of a bit of good news, Fed official jawboning, and with a dollop of extra cash to capitalize on it, the dealers managed to raise the DOW by 619 points.

It will be impossible to maintain this momentum without huge additional cash injections. This is illustrated by the fact that the ISE Sentiment Index, which indicates how many real investors want to buy stocks, printed at a sad 79 at the end of the big rally Wednesday. In other words, the rally was contrived, and additional upward catalysis operations will require larger and larger sums of cash.

All of this leaves the Fed in a pickle. Throwing $23 billion at a falling market, didn't stop the decline of stock prices. If they throw in another $23 billion, every three days, stocks will be suspended for longer, or will fall by a only a mediocre amount. But, this cannot go on forever. The current ""reverse repo fund"" has already been drained down to $68.719 billion. That's only enough for a few more trading days. Once it is drained down to zero, the Fed is out of ammunition.

At the zero point, they will be forced to return to either overt money printing (QE) or the covert money printing (TOMOs that are never paid back). Otherwise, there will be a very large percentage decline in virtually all the indexes. We will see either a Great Depression style stock collapse, or a new money printing program. Since ""QE"" is now a dirty word, they will call it something else. Probably, they will go with the covert TOMO route. In the end, however, it is all the same. They will print money.

Between now and then, you could lose a lot of money. During the period 2001-07, the daily cash TOMO injections typically amounted to only a few hundred million dollars. Now, the injections will have to be exponentially greater. At $20 billion a pop, people will begin to notice, regardless of how covert the Fed tries to behave. The end result will be a loss of confidence in the Federal Reserve.

Money printing, however you call it, has a profound effect on precious metal prices. From 2001 to 2009, for example, when TOMOs were used exclusively, gold more than tripled in response to a substantial increase in the money supply. Later, when the POMOs (QE) began, gold soared to $1,900. Both money printing methods put heavy upward pressure on precious metals prices.

The current administration seems dead set on stopping gold from being a ""canary in the coal mine"" that lets investors know what is really going on. It appears to have taken the role as ""supplier of last resort"" in the gold market. Admittedly, it has thousands of tons of the yellow metal. Theoretically, US-owned gold could feed markets for a long time, filling excess demand, and restraining prices against their natural tendency to rise. But, not even America has unlimited resources.

Filling even the current level of supply deficiency will drain the gold reserve to zero in only a few years. And, with the probable loss in confidence in the Fed, the drain will increase exponentially. The gold reserve might not even last a year after that. It is unlikely that the powers that be, desperate though they may be, will risk everything. They are well aware that gold reserves may be critical in the new monetary world that finally unfolds after this crisis is over.

Precious metals prices will eventually rise dramatically. It is just a question of whether it happens this year or 2-3 years in the future. That's why, right now, buying gold as a long term hedge is your best bet. For those caught still holding stocks, however, the good news is that more cash injections are on the way. It is the only method that the Fed can use to offset the speed by which stocks are falling and it will happen until the Reverse TOMO Reserve Fund is entirely exhausted.

About $68.719 billion remains and it will be used before the Fed considers any more money printing. It is reasonable to expect that a combination of cash injection, jawboning and hyping up of stray pieces of good news will be used, in the near future, to catalyze additional up days. Some of them may be very large as the Fed opts for a ""shock and awe"" campaign. Don't be shocked or awed. Get ready to use the opportunity to sell. The long term future is dismal.

Absent money printing, there will be a very large decline in stock prices. We do not yet know the timing. If the decision is to print more money, as is likely, stocks will rise when looked at in nominal terms. However, the Fed will lose so much credibility that the value of the dollar will be greatly impacted. For that reason, a significant delay in making that decision will probably occur. Stocks must fall first, and the techniques they are now using must be proven to be a definitive failure.

It is prudent to use these artificial rally days to get out before the big decline that spurs the Fed into renewed money printing. Then, you can get back in, or choose an alternative investment that will benefit more from the loss of Federal Reserve credibility.",12

Even if brokers need to be licensed, you could just have the system programmed to only allow you to make legal transactions, eliminating the need for licensing as well. 

Just wondering this every time I pay Charles Schwab $9/transaction to do essentially nothing.

15-08-28,3iqjhx,Pay off debt or invest,"I know what the obvious answer is, to pay off debt, but let me explain. 

29 year old long term investor with 401k already maxed well past what my company requires for a match and with an emergency fund saved up

I have $10k remaining on my car loan with a low interest rate of 2%. I have been paying well over the minimum ($200) for years. The way the bank is set up that I have the loan through, when I pay over the minimum, it pushes back my due date for my next payment. Right now my next payment is not due until May of 2016.

So would you:

A) keep paying over the minimum until it's paid off

Or 

B) pay the minimum and invest the rest to take advantage of compounding growth

C) not make any payment until it's due and invest it all to take advantage of compounding growth ",2

We shall see, but at least history suggests the rebound has further to go, says Barclays. 

Here is the full article so you can do your diligence.

After the gut-wrenching fall, the violent rebound. By mid-global session yesterday most national equity benchmarks were storming higher and S&amp;P 500 futures were showing a 7 per cent bounce off 10-month lows hit this week.

The question for investors is whether the rally represents merely an oversold snapback in what is now a bear market, or a necessary correction that allows the bull run to resume?

We shall see, but at least history suggests the rebound has further to go, says Barclays.

“Still, after 250 trading days the S&amp;P 500 was higher nine out of 10 times, and in most cases it was substantially higher.”

15-08-28,3ip6fj,What is Applebot and why should Google investors care?,"**What is Applebot?**

Applebot is Apple's Webcrawler and their first foray into building a search engine. Apple has compared Applebot to Google Bot.

**Why are they doing this?**

Because iOS 9, which is in public beta and is rumored to be released shortly after Apple's September 9 event, deeply enhances Siri, iOS search, and Safari search to integrate all sorts of content. Applebot is an important piece of that plan.

**What is Apple doing with Search?**

Apple is integrating Siri, iOS search, and Safari’s search with user’s individual content from 3rd party apps, popular public content that iOS users engage with in aggregate in 3rd party apps, and public content that anyone engages with on any platform using the web. iOS 9 contains several new technologies to pull of this off. 

**Indexing local content**

One technology new to iOS 9 is CoreSpotlight, which allows 3rd party app's data to be indexed by the operating system. For example, your Facebook contacts will now be searchable from the iOS home screen. Tapping a contact can deep-link directly to that person in Facebook’s app.

**Indexing user activity in iOS**

Another technology in iOS 9 has the technical name NSUserActivity, and is based around locally tracking what the user is doing so that relevant results can be promoted in searches later. For example if you look at someone's profile in Facebook's app, Facebook can inform iOS about this through NSUserActivity. Suppose you have multiple friends named ""John"", but were recently viewing one particular John's profile. iOS will be able to use this information so that when you search for ""John"" later, not only do you see John's contact information from the Facebook app in iOS search, but the John you have been recently viewing will have his result promoted to the top. For privacy reasons this is indexed only locally and so your activity never leaves your device.

**Indexing public content users engage with in iOS**

The most important advancement comes when an iOS developer marks an activity (such as viewing a public Facebook profile, or reading a News Article) as eligible for public indexing. In this case, the user's activity in the 3rd party app *does* leave the device, albeit in an anonymized form. The activity goes to Apple’s new Apple Cloud Index.

For example if a lot of iOS users have engaged with a news article in the NYTimes app, that article will appear in iOS Safari search when the user queries for matching terms. Apple has stated that users spend 86% of their time in apps, and only 14% of the time on the web, so it wants the content users engage with *in apps* to be promoted everywhere in iOS. Apple’s search results will be promoted above Google Search suggestions in Safari and will require fewer steps to reach content. If the user has the associated app installed, Apple search results will deep link into the app. If they do not have the app installed they will direct to the content's webpage, which will typically have a banner on top offering to install the app and open the content there.

**So what about web content?**

That is where Applebot comes in. If a website contains markup for mobile deep links Applebot will index it and promote it in Safari search results. Apple supports existing standards for deep linking markup, like Twitter cards, Facebook app links, and more. What this means for 3rd party apps that have a web presence, is that if they have popular content on the web that is also accessible in their app, Apple will promote this content in iOS and Safari search. These Apple search results will bring users to content more quickly than Google search suggestions, will be presented with rich layout, and support deep linking directly to 3rd party apps.

**What’s the executive summary?**

Apple is building a search engine which it is fully integrated into iOS search, Safari search results, and Siri and it is favoring this search above Google search in Safari search results. The way these results will be favored is that they will appear faster and with fewer steps, will be presented using rich layout, and will be actionable and provide deep linking into apps. Search results will take into account an individual’s local content while preferring the content they engage with often, they will take into account what public content iOS users engage with in apps in aggregate, and what content is popular on the broader web in general. Suggested Google searches will be demoted to the bottom of Safari’s search results. Apps and websites will race to integrate with Apple’s new search technologies in order to have their content promoted. Google search will lose at least some market share on iOS. It is unclear how much.

**Why do I feel like telling people this?**

Because it's something the media hasn't covered very much, but will become very very important soon. It's one of those things whose ramifications are really only understood by developers at this point, but will ultimately impact shareholders.",0

Even now volatility keeps surging as stocks remain flat for the day.

I get that, being in my early 20s, I'll have a more aggressive risk allocation and will be more diversified than these strict stock indices.

15-08-29,3ivcph,"What's your favorite platform/company to invest on all international markets and commodities? ─I'm new at this, need help finding the right middle-man.","Hi /r/stocks,

I'm 33 from France, and want to begin investing. I'm considering this *long*-term (10-30y+). Ideally I'd like to be as *hands-on* myself as possible on the markets themselves, when it makes sense. I certainly don't want your-local-bank's-awesome-product-at-.005%-tax-free.

We're talking about 'small' amounts to begin with (as low as I can get away with to have a decent, diverse portfolio, so I'm thinking maybe $5-10K?). However I want to be able to scale and drop $100K or more in there, if that's how it rolls later (*years*, probably) down the road.

I'd like to invest in:

* **Stocks**. Something like 1/3 indexed to a few major markets (DOW, a few key EU and Asian places), 1/3 indexed on **tech** indices (bio, nano, robotics, AI), and the last third perhaps a bit more dedicated to stream revenue, maxing dividends, placing 'bets' on companies, and such. I want access to international markets: at least EU and US, preferably Asian as well especially on tech values.

* **Commodities**. Today I'd tell you **Silver** (I don't need to hold the metal physically, only in name, knowing I'm trading the commodity directly, as opposed to mining companies shares for instance; and I understand ETFs but don't see which is more suited to long-term investment while being able to do shorts at the same time), and **Oil** (can you actually *buy* oil and re-sell it later at a better price?); but I'd like to be able to buy **gold** and other metals down the road.

So, how can I actually do that? 

There's like a myriad banks and online companies proposing services, but I just can't begin to compare. I know too little for that. I don't want to be scamed or pay twice what transactions should cost. I want a good company that can really *enable* individual investors. I do trust one of my banks (ING), but I'm not so sure they're the best middleman for trading.

What I'd like is suggestions of good services you've experienced first or second hand. 

I'd really like to be able to trade Google, the Nikkei or Silver in a matter of minutes from the decision to the actual 'click' that enables the action.

Additionally, for those who feel like writing and sharing, a bit of explanation as to how one can actually proceed more generally. 

For instance, is it possible to actually invest directly on the market, as a freelance trader? Can I mix that with a few managed funds to help me on some tough markets where I just couldn't better by myself? (thinking of metals and oil here especially).

I know enough about computers to run/build my own rig/software, if that's even a thing. I'm all about learning as well, I do not intend this to be a side hobby but rather a life-long journey, at a sustainable pace.

Any help will be greatly appreciated!",3

http://i.imgur.com/1O3Iok7.png?1

These plots show Chipotle's stock price along with the 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, and 12 month annualized return over time. 

I like using a simple heuristic to help me manage my investments: if an investment or trade has done well, and it's done well enough for me to want to tell other people, then it's time to exit the trade or buy some protection via selling calls, buying puts, or some other method. 

These plots are a slight formalization of that heuristic -- it allows me to see how extreme recent moves are relative to the full history. It's a pathetic and simplified attempt at a mean reversion trading strategy. 

For example, the most recent move to $750 a few weeks ago represented the most extreme 1 month move in the two years, and the second or third most extreme move in the past five years, and that fact combined with fundamental research suggests that the stock is unlikely to go higher. Maybe it was a good time to write some calls. 

Plots were made using ggplot2 with data from Quandl. The code is all set up, so I could generate these plots for other stocks if someone is interested. ",0

So in that case, with motif investing and robin hood out there making trades cost 30 cents or less each, why not just go out and look at the list of total stock market index fund holdings and randomly select 30 of them to buy and pay a one time fee of $10 instead of a percent of assets under management?

15-08-28,3is8ju,Why Simulators are Important (beginners) if you have anything to add as far as advice please do so!,"Long story short I've been looking into investing for a while now. I just recently turned 20 and have been using simulators on and off since my sophomore year in high school. I did have a moment after i turned 18 where I started trading with 500 in my account. After a large loss about $120 (attempted trading with penny stocks) I was discouraged and just let the remainder sit in my account. Recently after doing some more research on what is going on in the markets currently I found a little bit of success using the thinkorswim simulator. 

I started the account with $1500 and turned it into $2200 within two days. Recently I saw someone in the comment section saying that simulators were useless and did not feel like the real thing. Im not quite sure what they meant by ""the real thing"". I think they meant they would rather prefer new traders lose their real money without any practice or testing of strategies. I have read on some forums that there are still some traders still use simulators to practice and test out new strategies.  

As far as people really wanting to start trading (I don't consider myself as someone who trades lol I only made one) so this still applies to me. I would suggest this, start trading with somewhere between $500 to $1000 in your account. I myself will start with around $1000 to $1500. Usually you do not want to invest all of your money into one stock, but if you are starting with a small amount and wish to get some type of return for your efforts this is probably what you will need to do.

If you are looking into investing and have heard of Penny Stocks understand this.
DO NOT put all your money in stocks that are literally worth a couple cents hoping that the price will go up slightly and you will make a profit (this is the first mistake I made on my first trade).

To conclude I don't use Reddit much but as a beginner this is the information I have learned so far. Understand how useful simulators are, even if you have no actual money, if you want to practice while you save your money for real trading they are a great resource.

For that one person who actually read this to the end thank you, and for the experienced trader who read this and have anything to add or correct I would appreciate any type of knowledge.

I am up so much now and worst case is I lose a couple hundred of my profit from the week. No stop loss needed motherfucker, this thing is gonna crash again. EGO.

15-08-28,3isd1u,How do you avoid the peak?,"Let's say you do a bunch of FA and some basic TA. You know that next week or two a small cap will pop. It's at $1 right now, fluctuates between .90 - 1.10.  

You want to get in deep but only when you know the pop is happening. A few days later, volume picks up and the stock is quickly 1.40. You called it! Another pick right! Here we go, time to get on this train as it leaves the station. You wait for a small dip and enter at 1.30, locked and loaded. Mid-day it's at 1.50 and you're feeling good. Then, due to shorts or people taking profits, it closes at 1.25 and now you're down. It never kept going higher and you're left holding the bag. It sits around 1.30 for two weeks even when FA says it should have kept rising.  

Getting in too early might have meant that the pop wasn't happening yet, but hesitating left you at the peak of what should have been a long ride to Yachtville, USA.  

This happens to me a lot. I nail a pick, entry seems at the bottom of the moon shoot but turns out to be slightly red and never goes back up. Maybe it will in months, but it was intended to be a 1-3 day swing.  How do you avoid this and make sure the peak isn't reached before entering?

United Steel workers are calling foul b/c their government is subsidizing the exports and selling steel under market value. The industry is screaming for the US government to implement tariffs on imports of Chinese steel. On 09/13/13 US steel manufacturers filed similar suit and their stock rallied and about tripled over the next year or so. The stock is currently trading around its five year low. The election cycle is ramping up and politicians will stumping in a lot of swing states were the United Steel workers Union has a lot of votes to give. The politicians will need those votes so they'll be pandering to the steel conglomerate. I think that this is more of a long hold as opposed to being purely yolo in nature.",0

So... lets get to it.

-
**Finances** (*All Fundamentals courtesy of ThinkOrSwim*)

-

-
Sporting a solid $32.63 Earnings Per Share and a P/E of -1.72, this company seems to be confusing to most. Most analysts are pointing to sell, and the price target is about 10.50. So not much room to grow right? Well, over the past couple days it not only has resisted the sell off, it's actually become *more* volatile and reached a high of 10.10 on Friday. Ridiculous momentum and swing trading going on.

The Book Value Per Share is around $-34.63. Free Cash Flow Per Share comes in at around $13.57, also a very solid number. The Company's Revenue is way down, and on a strong down trend along with Net Income. Market Cap is a little over $1B, so not a Blue Chip per se but a healthy company in that aspect. However, the debt is the problem.

-
**Upcoming Catalysts**

CZR is currently under a lot of pressure, as it allegedly illegally refused to pay back $7B dollars in debt to bondholders. The good news from this is the Judge temporarily dismissed the case on the grounds that there was no hard evidence, but she left the option over for either side to immediately appeal the decision (which the bondholders presumably will.) So this leaves a Trial for CZR. If the ruling stands, CZR will fly to the moon, their debt will SIGNIFICANTLY decrease, operating margin will go up, the whole nine. However, if the ruling is overturned, CZR officials say they will need to declare bankruptcy. This company is at a very volatile make or break point at the moment and takes the ballsiest of balls to get in now for the long term. However, if you are a momentum trader or swing trader, then you have until Sept 30 (deadline to file for appeal) to get in on the rapid gains of the days.


Q2 Results came in, not too impressive but majorly overlooked due to the whole court case. 


Please let me know how I did analyzing this, and please **DO NOT GO IN TO THIS TRADE EXPECTING RESULTS BECAUSE OF ME**. I do not want to be held liable for your shenanigans. I'm getting out Monday to lock in profits.

An example to help maybe:

Johnny is 25 years old, a ways off from retirement and just getting into investing. He has each pay check funding his Traditional company 401k and is putting in the full amount ($5,500) towards his personal Roth IRA over the course of the year. These are both set to an aggressive allocation due to his age and risk tolerance, lets say 90/10 or 80/20.

Johnny also has some money in savings that he wants to use to open some investment accounts that are on a bit of a shorter timescale than his 401k and IRA. He opens an account with Vanguard, invests the $5-10k he has in a total market fund (or a few) as they have a less aggressive allocation.

Should Johnny be pooling these together, thus turning his very aggressive &amp; not so aggressive allocations into more of a middle of the road allocation....or should these be considered separately since they are for different purposes?

15-08-29,3itz21,Picking up pennies in front of a bulldozer,"I thought this bearish commentary was particularly relevant to this week.. 

&gt; ""Picking up pennies in front of a bulldozer"" comes to mind when viewing the current situation, where many stocks have rallied after breaking through primary support. Markets find short-term support and the temptation is to snap up bargains. But probabilities have inverted. Buying on the dips is no longer the profitable strategy that it was in the bull market — with high probability of substantial gains outweighing the low probability of material losses. We are now in a bear market where we face low probability of material gains versus high probability of substantial losses.

&gt; Why have probabilities inverted? There are two types of sellers active during a crash: *astute investors seeking to reduce their market exposure; and traders seeking to profit from the fall by selling stocks short*. The first group are likely to sit on the sidelines after they have sold, waiting for the turmoil to pass. *But short-sellers tend to take profits when the initial spurt of selling slows*, their purchases encouraging a few brave souls to venture into the market, picking up pennies in front of the bulldozer. 

&gt; There are two forces ranged against these buyers. First, short-covering will fade as the market rises and short sales are likely to again rise. Second, there is a large group of investors sitting on stocks who missed the opportunity to reduce their exposure during the initial sell-off. Their confidence now shaken after the sharp fall, the group forms a large block of resistance. As stocks rise, they enter the market in increasing numbers, causing the rally to falter. When the rally falters, the number of sellers swells alarmingly, initiating a second decline. The cycle may repeat several times until eventually new buyers enter the market.

&gt; The market in times like this is driven by sentiment. Gauging reaction to good and bad news is the best measure of investor resilience.

Pretty good explanation of market dynamics in this situation - of course only right if we continue down, which won't happen if QE is announced.

15-08-30,3ixpgw,Tools for portfolio calculations?,"I have been investing in stocks for a couple of years, but I feel I lack some tools for accurately tracking my performance. I invest exclusively in NA and Euro stocks and I have several broker accounts. I want to track my aggregate performance.

From the top of my head I would like to have:

* Proper TWR (Time weighted return) performance analytics (based on transactional data)
* Yield, Yield on cost,  Internal Rate of Return, Standard deviation, Sharpe ratio
* Year to date and month to date performance
* Being able to show daily, weekly, monthly or yearly performance
* Asset allocation and Security selection effects versus benchmark
* Currency effects
* Capital and income (dividends) performance decomposition
* Excess return versus benchmark
* Calculate performance with our without fees and taxes
* Being able to put weight limits on country, currency and sectors and individual shares an get alerts if they are breached
* Calculate on individual portfolios or groups of portfolios or on individual securities 
* Being able to change reporting currency
* 10 years of market data (I have trades going back that far)
* Intraday market data, so that I can track my performance during the day. I don't mind some amount of delay, though.

* Construct dashboards where I can pick and choose the analytics I want to look at and have them presented as line charts, bar charts or pure numbers. 

Ideally, all of this would fit in one online application that is easy to use, pleasing to the eye and be moderately priced. I wouldn't mind manually inputting my transactions, as long as it's easy.

Systems that can offer this (and more) exists of course, but they are very expensive and are aimed for institutional investors. I have not found something for individuals trying to keep track of their personal finances.

I find myself maintaining ever-growing spreadsheets to partly get the analytics I want, but it is getting unmanageable.

What are you guys using? Do you find yourself wanting the same thing?

15-08-30,3ixv0s,(EU) Something to chew on [property investment],"Long time lurker, loving this thread and all the wisdom here!

This would be a theoretical exercise which I'm contemplating. I'm a Scandinavian expat with a lot of love for Romania. I live there whenever I get the chance and already bought an apartment in Bucharest which I'm currently renting to a friend (~6% return/year).
My personal finances are in order vs. retirement savings, mortgages and whatnot.

I'm stacking up some money in my current job and wish to build a Villa in Bucharest tailored for foreign expat families. Expected monthly rent would be 2-3k€ excluding 16% taxes. Rough estimated costs of construction are 100k€ for the land and another 120k€ for the building. 25% down and the rest from the bank at ~5% interest. Maintenance costs are next to nothing and negligible in this math. 

As far as I can gather from economical analyzes the market is pretty close to bottom, however this is a EU-country capital with a lot of potential which I have faith in.

Now, can I kindly ask you wizards out there to take a few minutes to look at the reports from Romania and tell me if I'm crazy, stupid, bold, a visionary or none of the above?

If I buy a 1month call for XYZ at a strike price of $50 and a sell call for $52, isn't my chance of making money very high? Let's say the company has been mildly bullish and has no reason to go down anytime soon, the probability of it being able to go up only $1.50 in a span of a month is very high IMHO. If I keep doing that constantly, it should be easy to make consistent gains using options, correct? What am I missing here?

&gt;**Summary**
First, it now should be clear that the fundamental underpinnings of the financial markets are -- at a minimum -- somewhat fragile. Second, many retail investors seem unable to stomach such bouts of volatility, resulting in outsize disposals of equity mutual funds. Third, the plumbing of the marketplace appears far from immune to dysfunction during periods of great price volatility. Fourth, during intense volatility, the good gets washed out with the bad.  Finally, though policy makers are still eager to curtail spikes in market volatility, they already have expended a lot of ammunition via quantitative easing, floored interest rates and other unconventional policies.

The $1.30 range is a historical low for this company so you're not buying a run-up.  Awaiting a FDA response due ""any time now"" to take the conditional part off their approval and make it a standard test.   Has improving revenues and [a new customer](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/signal-genetics-expands-reimbursement-myprs-123000520.html) that's not reflected in the latest quarterly.  Management believes in the stock, the CFO recently [added 60,000 shares](http://insideri.com/1590750_000120919115066072_0001209191-15-066072), the director [also added shares in august](http://insideri.com/1590750_000120919115064905_0001209191-15-064905).  Note that these insider transactions rule out a purchase of the company in the near future.

**CATALYSTS:**

* Trading under value of company should draw notice.  [Zacks upgraded them to a buy](http://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/SGNL) last week likely on this issue.
* FDA notice ""soon"" (no idea when) on companion status -- See the [conditional approval PR](http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/02/02/702061/10118010/en/Signal-Genetics-Receives-Conditional-Approval-of-Investigational-Device-Exemption-for-MyPRS-R.html) from February.  From one of the stock's followers: *""Should have been 90 days after UAMS submitted the original data. Should be any day now as its been well over 90.""*
* Next ER with even MORE cash on hand, and revenues from their new client.

**SUPER TINY FLOAT** -- $7mil.  However in July $SGNL authorized ~$4mil new shares to be added to the float.  Its likely the market has already consumed these new shares so the actual float is roughly $11mil which is still tiny.  The dilution would also account for the currently depressed prices.  AQXP is an example of what a low-float stock can do on good news, BUT SGNL doesn't have a large buyer like the baker brothers buying in (yet) so don't expect the stock to touch $50.

**Short volume** is low at around 30% which is something of a bullish indicator since they don't believe it will go much lower.

**WARNING SUPER LOW VOLUME** -- be careful and patient and exercise limits.  Be aware that if anything goes wrong it may be difficult to extract yourself from the stock if you invest substantially.  Good news should spike volume enough to exit gracefully once you achieve your target.

**Caveats**: 

* This company continues to report net loss per shares.  It has a large volume of cash on hand but as the recent July dilution shows this company is using its stock to capitalize its deficit burns.  No further dilution is expected until after the FDA announcement and there should be a window to exit gracefully before that can happen.
* The company has [203,000 outstanding warrants](http://stocknewsflow.com/1590750_000114420415042083_0001144204-15-042083) however these are exercisable only at 3.60 (160,000 shares) and $12.50 ( 42,500 ). These prices do reflect the stock price targets the company (and the warrant holders) expect to achieve.
* Because of the low volume and float this stock has been and will continue to be subject to manipulation and pump and dumps.  Until there's news that drives volume you should be prepared to weather the manipulation and if there's a pump on no news, be prepared to set an exit target before the dump.

**Target:** I do not have a target price for this stock other than it will go up by the next ER.   I expect at least 50-100% on positive FDA news and with the low float its possible to go MUCH higher than that.

15-08-31,3j2fd2,"I've been reading WSB for a week, now I'm ready to YOLO $4,000: OPK =&gt; AMDA &amp; SGNL =&gt; NBG =&gt; Yacht","$4,000 on OPK before Sep 5th, with a stop loss set to sell everything if the price drops below 85% of what I paid for it. If it does go up on the following Monday (Sep 7th), I'll keep adjusting my stop to be around 15% under the current price, and plan to keep holding it until the end of the week if it doesn't hit the stop until then.

I really like stop loss orders. You don't have to actually sell your shares to get back your principal and lock in some profit, so if a price keeps going up, you make way more money. Also it prevents you from making decisions based on emotion.

After I sell OPK, I'm putting everything into AMDA (69%) and SGNL (31%). (So I'll be putting $2,346 into AMDA, and $1,054 into SGNL.) I chose 69% because I'm currently rewatching The Office, and I feel like that's something that Kevin would do. I also feel like AMDA is the slightly safer bet, although I'm probably going to lose money on both. But SGNL has the crazy low float and I like what happened to AQXP. My stop loss is going to be 50% on both of these, because I think they're going to be extremely unpredictable.

I want to get into NBG as soon as possible, so I won't be holding AMDA and SGNL for too long. So I'm going to sell everything and put all of the money from AMDA and SGNL ($1,700) into NBG. I should also mention that $30,000 will be my maximum bet on NBG, because I may have more than that by this point. I really think there could be 3000% returns with NBG over the next 5-20 years. This time there's no stop loss, it's either going to zero, or it's going to the moon. I'm betting that Greece is going to start recovering at some point. I have no idea how to calculate the probability of that, so it's really just a hunch. But I'm looking forward to cashing out a little bit to buy a yacht, and also a mansion on a private island in Greece where I can park my yacht.

I will post updates after each stage. I've just placed an order for 192 shares of OPK for when the market opens. Waiting on a deposit and some other funds to clear before buying the rest this week.

Any other tickers I should look at? AVXL looks interesting but I'm just using Robinhood, so I can't buy OTC.

UPDATE: Bought 205 shares of OPK at $11.16 ($2,287.80)

I backtested such portfolio consisting 70% Mid Cap Value and 30% Long Term Treasuries using https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation and I found it's been performing better than Total US Stocks + Total Bonds during periods which I tested (rebalanced yearly to keep 70/30 ratio). I checked upwards periods of 2002-2007 and 2008-2014, downward periods of 1999-2002 and 2007-2008 and mixed periods of 1996-2014 and 1987-2014.

Here http://i.imgur.com/FJIJsMm.png is a screenshot of how much better is Mid Cap Value + Long Term Treasuries (Portfolio 1) than US Stock + Total Bonds (Portfolio 2). It has better growth rate and lower max drawdown than the classic stocks+bonds portfolio.

This confirms my internal reasoning/investment belief that Mid Cap Value are the most compelling companies to invest in. However I know nothing about bond funds and I just checked past performance of different types of bond funds to pick Long Term Treasuries as the best performing.

Is there anything wrong with this idea? What are the risks of substituting Total US Stocks with Mid Cap Value and Total Bonds with Long Term Treasuries? What could go wrong?

I have 25-year investment horizon for a lump sum invested now with intention to reinvest dividends. I will probably restructure the portfolio after ~25 years to match my age and to start consuming dividend income.

Is my 2-fund portfolio Mid Cap Value + Long Term Treasuries a reasonable thing to do? (I skip international market here because I'm from abroad and I invest only part of my money in the US market, so I have the international market covered elsewhere, so this question is only for the US part of my portfolio).

15-08-31,3j50go,If Chicago Cubs make the Playoffs = Stock Market Bear?,"Courtesy of Nicholas Santiago at inthemoneystocks.com

Who would ever think that the Chicago Cubs baseball ball team would have anything to do with the stock market? However, when you look back at history, it really does appears to have signaled some major tops and bottoms in the stock market when the Cubs have made the playoffs. After all, isn’t a cub a baby bear?

Lets take a look at recent history in the stock market when the Chicago Cubs baseball team has made the Major League baseball playoffs.

Below are the years when the Chicago Cubs have made the playoffs and the stock market reaction:

2008 Chicago Cubs Stock market crash and bear market


2007 Chicago Cubs Stock market top in October


2003 Chicago Cubs Start of bull market from the top make in 2000


1989 Chicago Cubs Nothing notable, but the Chicago Bulls basketball team made playoffs


1984 Chicago Cubs Nothing notable


1938 Chicago Cubs Stock market finds low after the 1037 crash


1935 Chicago Cubs Nothing notable


1932 Chicago Cubs Stock market low from the 1929 top


1929 Chicago Cubs Stock market top and start of the Great Depression


1918 Chicago Cubs Nothing notable


1910 Chicago Cubs Stock markets end sharply negative


1908 Chicago Cubs Stocks rally all year long beginning in February


1907 Chicago Cubs Markets crash, run on the Knickerbocker Trust


1906 Chicago Cubs Nothing notable

It should be noted that not every year that the Chicago Cubs make the playoffs was a terrible year for stocks. There have been times when it has been an end to the bearish action and the start of a new bull run. Unfortunately, the stock market this year has been trading at new all time highs, so if the Chicago Cubs make the playoffs this year it could be bad for the markets going forward. While this may just be a coincidence, it is interesting to note none the less.",12

seems to me if you can do this, it might be a way to get a buy order in on a crazy quick downdraft, whereas with a typical limit order, you'd have to be changing it everyday more or less.

15-08-31,3j58g1,What do you think about $PTN,"Some simple analysis:

-Sprout was bought out for $1 Bill
-Sprout flibanserin received FDA approval, and by all accounts and statistics bremelanotide is a better drug
-Women can't consume alcohol on flibanserin

Putting FDA approval at ~0.65 (historical average at stage 3), and assuming $1 Billion in 2 years I get $650 Mill. Discount back at 20% is $450 Million now (not including the possibility of an unknown buyout).

This leaves the warrants:

-31 MM Series A
-35 MM Series B
-25 MM Series C
-0.67 MM Series D
-22MM Series E
-2 MM Series F
-0.5 MM Series G

-&gt; ~116.17 MM warrants and ~57.12 MM shares.

However, there are pretty significant restrictions on the warrants. If QVT and I assume Baker Bros., Deerfield, and Sphera exceed 10%, 5%, 5%, 5% in ownership respectively, they cannot exercise their warrants. As they are very close to those numbers now, in the event that PTN does not need to raise funds (they have enough cash to make it to the end of phase 3), most of those warrants will not be exercised. If there are 80MM total shares market, I get a valuation somewhere around $5.6.

15-08-30,3iz4gj,My first year investing in one word: demoralizing,"It has been a bumpy year for me - I'm pretty well diversified with about 10% in PRHAX, 30% in big name companies (e.g., DIS, GOOG, etc), 40% in an ETF (VUG currently), and the rest in riskier and more volatile things (e.g., TSLA, SCTY, HAL).

I've shuffled things around a bit, but nothing dramatic and nothing too emotional. I get 30 free trades per month, so I'm not losing much by tinkering with my portfolio. 

Anyway, I've been up as much as 5% and down as much as 10% - today at about the one year mark I'm down 1% from my initial investment. I've spent a lot of time reading about stocks, reading about companies, and best of all, reading about how the market is going to crash into the bowels of hell any fucking day now!

But I've also read about Bob the most unlucky investor ever and I'm staying the course for a second year of frustration with the stock market. My thoughts pretty much every single month go something like ""could you just fucking go up a little bit without coming right back down three days later?""

So as we come upon the prophecy of the eternal bear market and the stock market's ultimate and total implosion, I'm being brave. I've set up automatic transfers and automatic investments in my brokerage account.

If you aren't too familiar and think of it as gambling, you are mistaken. It is a game where you are able to make a bunch of short term investments based on calculations of expected value, using as many factors as possible, and I have been consistently doing very well at my level of stakes for the last couple years. I am now looking for an investor for higher stakes, and was wondering what kind of stats someone that isn't familiar with poker would be looking for?


Here are some simple stats I've gotten:

Average roi per session is about 36% (which is even better than it sounds because I buy in for more than the average player does, but that doesn't mean that the extra money is also at the same risk level as the rest of the buyin)

Win/loss ratio is almost exactly 2:1

I have 150k in profits logged, standard deviation per session is about $1200

About 2500 hours logged, worst downswing was recovered within 100 hours (want to show risk of loss is near 0 with big enough sample size)


This is all scalable too, higher stakes are actually usually easier and therefore more profitable too.  I have everything on paper, the graph itself shows a consistent climb as well.

What stats would convince an investor that this would be profitable? Thanks!",0

15-08-31,3j3hvx,/u/fscomeau banned from WSB. Details enclosed.,"We have taken the decision to ban /u/fscomeau and all related alt and/or parody accounts.  Reason for the broad definition of the username is because his alt accounts are indistinguishable from parody accounts.  His ability to seamlessly switch between genuine stupidity and trolling is second to none.  Poe’s Law at its best I suppose.

WSB has a place of learning and a place to fuck around and have fun.  Those of you that have been here a while know that beneath the memes and jokes and occasional characters is a foundation of solid knowledge and a serious user base that rival all of the other trading related subreddits.  

It is also an unspoken philosophy of WSB that people not lose money in vain.  Yes there’s gambling and lots of uninformed comments and posts, but that is pretty much representative of the irl trading community.  This, however, is different.

Watching the chat this morning went from ultimate lulz and comedic gold to outright sadness.  There was a realization that we’re either (a) contributing to this guy losing his money by giving him attention, (b) running the risk that some of you may follow him due to his being idolized recently, (c) giving him free publicity for his book and/or possible paid services in the future or finally (d) allowing his stupidity to rub off on the good people of WSB.

I’d like to thank /u/fscomeau for some good laughs but we have to let you go.  

Below a word from senior moderator and chief public affairs officer /u/rawblem : 

***



PSA: Trusted Sources and Styles Worth Copying

   We'd just like to take this moment to officially advise all members of /r/wsb to be careful in which personalities and local characters you choose to follow, watch, listen to, or have your opinion swayed by. Charlatans and Snake Oil Salesmen have always found several of the market-related subreddits as a fertile breeding ground for enhancing their brand, expanding their influence, or, in some cases, finding paying customers willing to pay for advice or trading style systems. 

Wallstreetbets has always taken a strong stance against edgeless individuals charging money to peddle their worthless tips to our users. However, even in the case where no money changes hands at all, visitors of /r/wsb must carefully take stock of all contributors who's posts they follow, and all live-streaming personalities who may be gaining in popularity. 

While some may THINK that students of the market are able to learn not just from good traders, but also from the failures of others, /r/wsb does not agree with this point of view. There are a million ways to be wrong in the market. Continuously witnessing eratic, indecisive, or unhinged traders often leaves novice viewers believing that this type of trading is normal or desired. We here at /r/wsb would like to remind you that it is NOT normal, and is NOT something to be copied. 

Things to look for when deciding who to trust:

  1) Consistancy:   Does the personality have a calm consistant demeanor? Or does he have bi-polar mood swings and trade with a box of tissues next to his desk?

  2) A clear system:  The personality has outlined (or at least seems to have) a very clear or consistant trading style, rather than randomly entering or exiting positions, or, worse, allowing his viewers to decide which way to trade

  3) An understanding of how the market actually works. If the person has suggested calling his broker to cancel an already-filled order, he is someone you should not be paying attention to. 

  4) Success:  A visible record of success with more winners than losers. While no one has a 100% track record, one would expect that on any given day, even their first day live-vlogging, such a trader should have more winners than losers and have a positive expectency.

&amp;nbsp;

**Background:** I'm 24 and a graduate student in Neuroscience. An old teacher/friend of mine sent me some DD on ONVO, suggesting an upcoming spike so I decided to finally get in on this whole trading thing. 
  
&amp;nbsp;

**First Trade:** I put $500 into a TD Ameritrade account and bought 100 shares of ONVO at $3.9199 on April 1st. I held this until June 6th, when I sold at $5.42, making a $130 gain after fees. 
  
&amp;nbsp;

**Second Trade:** Bought 1250 shares of AMDA at $0.43 on June 15th, selling on June 19th at $0.55 for $130 in gain. It was shortly after this that I joined WSB. 
  
&amp;nbsp;

**Third Trade:** Bought back into ONVO, which had crashed following dilution (at the time, didn't quite get it). Grabbed 150 shares on June 23rd for $4.45 a share, then watched it drop until I finally sold on July 22nd at $3.75, losing $125. My first loss :(
  
&amp;nbsp;

**Fourth and Fifth Trades:** Like I said I was now reading WSB, so on June 23rd I bought AMDA (550 shares at $0.55) and TPIV (550 shares at $0.4799). I am still holding both of these. 
  
&amp;nbsp;

**Six Trade:** I got caught in some serious hype, and added an extra $400 to my account to buy 1 million shares of TBEV at $0.0003 on August 3rd. I sold this in 2 parts, half at $0.0008 to cover my investment and half at 0.0010, making $620 in profit. The pain of watching this garbage stock continue to go up haunts me nightly.
  
&amp;nbsp;

**Seventh Trade:** My shortest trade yet, I got 450 shares of PTN at $1 on August 17th and sold at $1.25 on August 18th, making $92.50 in profit. 
  
&amp;nbsp;

**Trades Eight and Nine (Where I sit now):** Bought 1500 more shares of AMDA, now averaged at $0.4659, as well as 500 shares of BGMD at $0.9. I'm still holding my original 550 TPIV as well.   
  
&amp;nbsp;

**Things I've learned:** To me, this is all a game. I make some money, but don't have a lot invested because I'm broke. Its really a chance to say ""I think this will go up"" and be proven right. I try to be logical about stocks (to a point) when I buy. TBEV was an obvious choice. It was trading at nothing, and had no product. The production date was approaching, and getting a product tends to help. Similar with PTN. The Sprout approval was all but certain, so playing that pop was easy. I've learned mixed messages about being selling points. You can end up bag holding (AMDA) if you hold too long, or miss out on a lot if you bail early (TBEV). Knowing when to sell is a lot of gut and deciding what is comfortable for you, then drinking a lot when you inevitably get it wrong. Most important lesson for me though is to pick your entry points well. Stocks go up and down, but unless a company goes bankrupt you can always make money on it if you pick the right entry point.   
  
&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR:** 5 months of trade with a $900 investment results in $847.52 in realized gain (35.36% gain), -$177.32 in unrealized loss (-10.38%) and a total return of $656.01 (72.89%) at the time of writing over the course of 9 trades. ",11

But since then I tried to find other tiny biotech BDCs and couldn't so I've gone back to take a closer look at FBIO to see if I should just go balls deep with them. 

What I've found is that they own a portion of CB Pharma, which is itself listed on Nasdaq ($CNLMU). CB Pharma is a blank-check company with ~9 months of life left in it before it has to be liquidated if it doesn't find successfully initiate a business combination. CB Pharma has no website and I can't find any news or PR not related to its IPO months ago. This is also the first American ticker I've ever found that is not listed on Finviz.  

FBIO also founded Journey Medical Corporation, which is also ""open to collaboration"" as evinced by its utterly blank products page. Their home page also advertises their BDC services but no actual fucking products or partners. It's less than a year old, but that still seems pretty sketchy.

- Post content you think will help balance the subreddit out with content you think is missing.

- Report low quality content.

- Do nothing

TL;DR - Stop bitching about the changes the mods deem important for the positive direction of the subreddit. There is freedom here on reddit to start your own subreddit if you believe that your counter-opinion adds enough value to create a strong community. ",0
15-08-31,3j438h,Help with Analysis Terms,"Hi let me preface this by saying I didn't post this in the advice thread bc it's not advice about any particular investment. If there's a better location for this post, please let me know politely. 


I'm a young guy and trying to get into investing. I'm currently reading several books on the topic, my biggest hiccup I think is the terminology. I have a strong math background but I struggle to know what the numbers represent.

I linked an example of [Ford stock](http://imgur.com/a/I55i1) that lists key statistics. If anyone could give me an eli5 or brief definition of some of these terms it would really help me out. Thanks",2

15-08-31,3j44l7,$UWTI: Round 2,"So I am a little pissed off because I kind of called the bottom on this in my post almost about 2 weeks ago now. 

I wasn't really that certain on $UWTI and how it operated and decided not to buy in because I didn't know enough about it. 

Having said that:
            
            1.) The jump today I am assuming was from news that OPEC is publicly saying they are concerned with the over supply and other depressors of oil prices right now. 
            2.) I don't think it will retain it's jump from today for the rest of the week (23% atm) so what do you all think about going in on this following a dip?
            3.) It was my own conscious decision not to buy, but I hate you all for influencing my decision not to buy at $0.77 hahahah. (Learning experience) 

But as always, thanks for all your individual input. This is a weird case, but you guys were right in the fact that I didn't know enough about it. I'm just sore because Dem Gainz. (:

15-08-31,3j44za,How do I find stocks? HELP,"So I just recently got back into trading. I tried a while ago but got discouraged after one loss. But now that I have enough money to actually make some type f profit, I want to do better when it comes to researching. I don't know how I managed but so far I am up $700 this week from four different picks. That might not be a lot of money to you but to a college student such as myself it is. My only problem is I cant quite remember how I found those four stocks to trade. I know I go on this thread a lot to get everyone opinions but I feel as if I am getting more lucky than anything. Basically I want to be able to find a stock on my own and make a profit on my own, just to show myself that I am making progress in my learning. lol and if that doesn't make sense, I basically want to be able to find a stock on my own without having one of you guys recommend one. Currently I use Yahoo finance to look for stocks but I feel like I don't know wtf I am looking for. As far as price anything under $5.00 is good. Is it also important to just look into general markets first before trying to find a specific stock? Such as oil or energy. I am definitely going to take a class next semester to gain a better understanding of everything. But for you self taught people out there please give advice.",3
