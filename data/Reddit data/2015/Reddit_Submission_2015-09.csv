15-09-01,3j5m3a,Top Fidelity Funds?/Portfolio Advice,"Hey everyone,

So I sold all my stocks in the last few weeks after being down over 20% from trading stocks these last few months.

I currently have about $9,000 in a Fidelity Roth IRA and am planning on putting it all into 2 or 3 Fidelity mutual funds, and just letting it sit long term for at least 10 years, which is what I should have done in the first place.

So I have a few questions I'd appreciate some advice with:

If I put some money in a fund like FBGRX (Blue chip growth), would it make sense to also buy into an index fund like FUSEX (S&amp;P 500), or would that be a bit redundant?

I'm planning to invest 100% in equities, but I'm not sure how much, if any I should put in an international fund?

I'm thinking it might just be easiest to go 100% with one index fund. If I choose to do that, what would you recommend between FUSEX (S&amp;P 500 index fund) and FSTMX (Total US market)? Seems like FSTMX is a little riskier, but should have a little better return over the long term.

What do you think about a portfolio of say, 40% FBGRX, 30% FDCAX, and 30% in an international fund? Thanks in advance!",1

The method is this:  when the S&amp;P 500 closes below its 300-day moving average, you sell.  When it closes above its 300-day moving average, you buy.  The article linked above shows some pretty impressive returns if you followed his method.

But, the graphs in his article end in 2012.

So, I created this graph of S&amp;P500 closing price vs its 300-day moving average, to the present.

That's right.  It has closed STRONGLY below its 300 day moving average.

15-09-01,3j75vs,"Q: VXX / XIV, what's the big deal? A: it's the +100%/year, once/twice in a decade yolo opportunity.","If you wondered what the big deal is with everyone watching VIX / VXX / XIV, this is why. Since 2008 / 2011, the VIX futures haven't been up this much.

XIV has dropped by over 50% now, and historically, it has always recovered within a few months if the crisis is lame, and even if not, it takes only 1y for 2011, 2y for 2008 to get back to the previous peak. Expected return: +100% in 3 months to a year: https://i.imgur.com/ZupbmSP.png - I'm guessing 6ish month now.

Scenarios:

* If this is a repeat of 2011 and the VIX stays high for 6 months, expect XIV to drop another 50% before it bottoms. From the bottom up, the previous level at +300% is reached in 12 months.
* If this isn't, the bounce back can happen in 3-6 months to +100%.
* If this is 2008 #2 instead, well, it takes 2 years, and another -75% on XIV.
* If this is something completely different and the market is fucked for good - say goodbye to your money. Backwardation for years means VXX and XIV swap places - see what 5 years of contango did to VXX: http://i.imgur.com/J7787lk.png - 1100 to 26 in 5 years, -53% per year annualized.

Warning: don't short VXX unless you can take a margin hit of $wtf. VXX was at 15, is now at 30, and at 2011 level, it will be at 60 and 2008 = 120. A 100 share short can grow from $1500 in value to $12000. XIV, the inverse, will lose 50%/75% of its value, but at least you don't get margin called.

Disclosure: I'm short VIX via XIV, holding until it recovers to 45ish, and have open orders to open more if it drops: http://i.imgur.com/ZlOIInN.png",10
15-09-01,3j769r,AAII,"Hi, I have access to AAII's website and am understandably impressed with some of the returns I've seen.  The thought occurs to me that if I were to employ the strategy of chasing their outsized returns, perhaps I could do quite well over the years.  Specifically, I have a play-money account with robinhood, and could follow some of the stock screens (those that pass only a handful of companies) with that. Obviously this will not be my entire portfolio, but I was just wondering if anyone has had good luck with the same train of thought.  I understand some of the limitations of such a strategy may include low volume and low diversification, but do the potential returns outweigh the risk, at least over time?  Thanks, usually I just lurk but sometimes the urge to ask a dumb one overwhelms... (25 years old).  I guess in a broad sense the question is not about AAII stock screens but any systematic attempt at aggressive returns for the not-so-casual investor, at least with a portion of his or her account, via stock screens.

15-09-01,3j6u95,Is picking and investing 30 individual stocks a smart move?,"So, is picking and investing 30 individual stocks a smart move? 

I'm mapping out my LONG TERM investment plan and I personally want to be involved with deciding which companies to invest in. I'm 26 years old and I can weather a lot of volatility.

I do have an automatic monthly contribution into Betterment in addition to these stocks, which I compare to some Vanguard funds. 

Separately, I have come up with a list of 30 stocks that I believe will do extremely well over the next 10-20 years and beyond. Some of these will be bought within my Roth IRA, and others will be bought in my individual brokerage account and Robinhood. (I use Robinhood until the commissions make sense with my brokerage)

My question is, are there any major risks I may be overlooking? I thoroughly research each stock and make sure nothing fundamentally has changed. I believe I'll be properly diversified once I invest in all these companies. I have bought into 14 out of 30 companies so far and I will periodically increase my holdings for each over time.

As I'm sure it will come up, here is the list:

Alibaba, Altria, Amazon, Annaly Capital, Apple, Celgene, Corenergy Infrastructure, CVS, Delphi Automative, EOG Resources, Express Scripts, Facebook, Gilead, Google, Home Depot, JP Morgan, Lockheed Martin, Netflix, Nike, Oshkosh, Paypal, Phillips 66 (Still researching this one), Realty Income, Reynolds American, Southwest Airlines, Union Pacific,  UnitedHealth Group, Walt Disney, WhiteWave Foods 

I'm considering dozens of other stocks to round out my 30.

15-09-01,3j7t7w,Results from the Pretzels Survey,"This is the results from the survey I posted about a week ago regarding the number of pretzels in a jar. Here is one of the threads I posted - https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3ic8vl/today_not_exciting_enough_lingering_around_the/ and it lead you to this link for the poll - http://mispey.com/guesspoll.php 

Here is how the survey worked if you didn't participate or forgot already. First page showed you pictures of a jar of pretzels (http://imgur.com/a/5er6J) and let you guess how many were in there and tell me how you made your guess (wild, light calculation, or more calculation). The next page asked you to give some detail about your guess (textbox) and then I presented people with the opportunity to guess again after being given additional information in the form of the THREE MOST RECENT GUESSES. Yes, I actually queried the database.

**THERE WAS A TRICK, kinda.** I purposefully grabbed the three most recent guesses that were either ABOVE or BELOW your first guess. 50% of the time someone would get the impression that they are guessing higher than others, and 50% of the time they would get the impression they are guessing too low compared to others. The purpose of this was to try to introduce some bias to the guesses. What happens when you're provided perfectly reasonable information but with a bias swung on it? Will you follow the false ""herd""?

**The Story - Why did I post this survey? What does it have to do with anything?**

This idea is ""stolen"" from a book called **The Wisdom of Crowds**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds **It essentially addresses a concept that explains some of economics, psychology and how markets work (in a sense)**. It says that despite many people in the ""crowd"" being essentially morons and only having a few real experts this ""crowd"" will be surpringly accurate. However this accuracy relies on a few factors - diversity and independence in the crowd, no centralization (local knowledge only) and the ability to aggregate the crowds thoughts into a collective decision (average!). Only when these are broken through issues (like no diversity of opinions, or beaucracy, or emotion, or influence) does this wisdom fall apart. 

I got the idea from Planet Moneys podcast Episode 644: How much does a cow weigh (http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/08/07/430372183/episode-644-how-much-does-this-cow-weigh). Surprisingly despite only having a picture of a cow the ""crowd"" was able to, within a few percent, guess the cows weight. This is despite the 17,000+ people responding being probably a bunch of armchair warriors. As well, they noticed how some ""groupthink"" resulted in worse guesses, and expertise gained no accuracy. So, this experiment set out to test this ""Wisdom of the Reddit crowd"". 

**The hypothesis was simple then** - I thought that people would be surprisingly accurate in their guess aka. the crowd would be wise. I also hoped that people who did a calculation would be surprisingly not that much wiser. I also hoped that if people were influenced by the new information that they would actually be worse off. I am only concerned about averages and perhaps standard deviation. I am trying to see what the ""crowd"" thinks, not individuals. 

**This hypothesis would manifest itself as**:

*1) Wild guessers and calculated guessers would have very similar averages (The uninformed crowd is just as wise as the informed)*

*2) The population average would be ""close"" to the correct number (The crowd is wise)*

*3) The crowd of people whose answer was ""influenced"" are become worse off on average (The wise crowd should not influenced by each other)*

**Tidbits of Info:**

There were **a total of 1,095 entries**. You will notice gaps in the ID's due to the database being trimmed for duplicates (I did a simple scan to deny duplicates based on IP and user-agent combinations), trolls, ""mistakes"" (if someone hit the back button they got ""two"" entries but then the second one got deleted) and ""fakes"" (didn't bother to fill anything out or my testing). I deleted any guess below 50 or above 1000. There were very few anyway - many were null or like troll over 1 million)

**708 of them were ""light calculations"", 377 were wild guesses and only 10 people had the guts to say they did more than a light calculation** (Yes, this adds to 1,095). This kind of implies that our crowd tried to be overall informed rather than morons - since I consider anyone who tried to calculate it to be part of our ""experts"" in the crowd.

**The average guess was 166, with people who did a light calc at 169, heavy calc at 204, and wild guess 160**. The **standard deviation was a whopping 115**. The ability to change your guesses later (Guess #2 column statistics vs. Guess #1 statistics) did not result in very different numbers, although this would be expected since there was equal bias in either direction (50/50 shot of the code trying to bias you down vs. up)

**The actual number of pretzels was....227**. Counted by hand. I did not eat them all - I was drunk with my friends we collectively we did eat them all. 

**Some initial observations:**

1) **The general population was not as wise as expected** and actually the people who did a lot of work (heavy calculations) did decently better. However, if you filter the database for the people who did more of a calculation and look at their calculations they actually seem more like ""light"" calculations. I was expecting the heavy calculation crowd to be throwing down packing factors and bringing in outside data about the size of the bottle/pretzels/bottle/etc. It appears that all people with ""more calc"" should actually be grouped in with the ""light calc"" crowd as their calculations seem to be on par with what people were doing in the lightcalc crowd. **For that reason I am not going to conclude that the heavy calculation population did better**. **The fact that the general population was not very wise is a bit disappointing. *Thoughts?***

2) **Now, what if I do try to figure out who did the ""heaviest"" calculations?** I figured anyone trying to factor in ""packing efficiency"" was trying to make a very well educated guess. So I searched for the word ""packing"" or ""efficiency"" and I've recorded these peoples results. 72 (stuck with 72), 102 (from a materials science major who then changed their guess to 160 after being ""biased"" upwards), 400 (who then adjusted to 420). **Oh no, you are all are not very good at all**. However, the data here is not statistically significant since I barely got any results where packing factors were included. 

3) **What if I increase my scope to include anyone who did a calculation involving Pi or Layering** (figuring out how much to a layer and guessing the number of ""layers"")? The average for these people is 176 for 156 guesses. Not really statistically different - 7 closer to that key ""correct"" number. Looks like doing a calculation doesn't help. 

4) **It almost seems like it doesn't matter what you did to guess** - at most the calculation crowd was 10-15 better than the wild guess crowd, but the average guess overall was 60 off! Just as relevant, the standard deviation actually INCREASED for people who did a calculation (lightcalc at 171, vs. wild guessers at 159). Can someone conclude for me, who is more versed in statistics, if I have any significance to my result? To me it seems to suggest that I was right that wild guessers and calculated guessers are basically on equal footing.

5) What about the bias introduced? **It seems that this bias did not affect the general population very much** but mostly because I was unable to influence a vast majority of the population (only 240 or ~1/5 of you changed your guess). So, this is a bit hard to do. First, I need to split the people into two groups - those who were presented larger numbers and those who were presented smaller numbers. A pivottable was created sorted by those influenced lower and those influenced higher, filtered by all the people who actually changed their guess. What happens to these people? 

Now, one thing to note is that there is an iteration of this poll script where people entered results that were NOT biased. The last three were actually the last three from the database, not biased down or up. These ones in the pivottable would  show up as ""False-False"" as they would not be particularly influenced up or down. Big surprise, most people who saw this version of the script didn't bother changing their answer....so I will skip analyzing these. 

First bit of analysis? How many people changed their minds between the wild guessers and the calculators? Since there are different numbers of each group I did a percentage. It seems that if you were ""influenced down"" there was no difference (0.90% difference) and on the other side the ""lightcalc"" guessers were actually 3.7% more likely to change their guess, which also seems like an insignificant difference. **The population was equally as easily influenced when presented with what they thought was valid information about others - despite the people with calculations doing more work to get their number.**

Predictably the people who were pushed downwards ended up moving their guesses downwards, and those who were pushed upwards ended up moving their guesses upwards. It seems that overall it evened out, with people generally changing their guess by 30 (average absolute value). As well, it seems that that people who did a calculation (23 down, 32 up avg) moved their guess slightly less than the wild guess group (43 down, 33 up).

**Overall the average second guess of the population of people who actually changed their guess was...185.** This actually makes them the most accurate population of people. What! No! This is not what I expected! So first thing to check - what is the average first guess for all of this population of ""changers"" - it is actually 181. This means the ability to sometimes influence overall didn't do much at all? I'm struggling to play with this data here. Does anyone have anything to add? Download the spreadsheet and play with this data. Is there anything to take away from this?

At the end there is only one thing for me to address. Who was closest? I am using Guess#2, of course. Sadly, nobody guessed 227. I think DeezNuts at 228 was a troll. At 226 /u/HalfLife1MasterRace was closest, and he did not waver on his Guess#1. Users /u/sjagr, /u/Boosh_The_Almighty, /u/hughgent and /u/financeterp guessed 230 (with /u/financeterp moving his guess 10 down from 240 due to some ""influence"").

**Thank you to those who answered. This was fun.**

How would this impact the euro? Would it devalue, or actually go up from expectations of better inflation and economic growth?

If it will devalue, should I sell soon? Do you think the euro will drop as soon as the ECB starts hinting at expanding QE or might the devaluation not price in so soon?

15-09-01,3j812j,"Yes, you can time the market.","A while back, I read this [interesting piece](http://dailyreckoning.com/a-better-way-than-buy-and-hold/) by a guy who has a simple method for timing the market. The method is this: when the S&amp;P 500 closes below its 300-day moving average, you sell. When it closes above its 300-day moving average, you buy. The article linked above shows some pretty impressive returns if you followed his method.

But, the graphs in his article end in 2012.

So, I created this graph of S&amp;P500 closing price vs its 300-day moving average, from 1997 to Aug 31, 2015.

[http://i.imgur.com/n1SqSd0.png](http://i.imgur.com/n1SqSd0.png)

That's right. It has closed STRONGLY below its 300 day moving average.

I'm honestly expecting a crash from here, as we find out in the coming months the full extent of China's deflationary depression, and the havoc it will wreak on US companies' earnings.

Also, to those who will comment, ""it has crossed below the average in the past and didn't crash"" - you're correct.  So you'd sell when it crossed below, and quickly buy again when it crossed above.  So you wouldn't miss out on any upside action.

The goal here is to be in cash when the market crashes.  And as I've been saying for months now - the market is expensive, and this is yet another sign that a downturn might be coming.

For reference St and J are married.  J is the current president and only member of the family owners currently working for the company.  S and K have been VP's for several years now.  Thanks for any insight you can give!

Good afternoon, 

The company is a company with 112 years of successful longevity and as a privately held company there have been generational and shareholder changes over this time.  As some of our shareholders look to their future and continue to explore their options as they relate to estate planning and diversification, we would like to bring you up to date on a couple of changes effective immediately:

The Board of Directors of (the “Company”) passed resolutions to appoint a Transaction Committee to oversee the Company’s ongoing evaluation and planning of liquidity alternatives for interested shareholders, including without limitation, a possible ESOP transaction.  Jo will be managing the transaction process for the Committee. 

Due to the Board’s concern about a possible conflict of interest in evaluating and executing such a transaction, J and St have agreed to take a leave of absence from their day to day company roles until the Committee determines that the evaluation is complete or a transaction is completed.  J will continue to serve on the Board of Directors.

The Board has named S and K as the individuals to assume the duties and role of President and Chief Executive Officer of Company as co-Presidents and co-CEOs until such time that the evaluation is completed or a transaction is agreed upon by the interested shareholders.

If you have any projects that you were working directly with J or St on, please contact S or K for continued direction. 

It is hoped that the above items will be completed by the end of the year and we thank you for your continued hard work and cooperation in the meantime.

Please continue to drive the 2015 business plan to your local budgets, take care of our customers, and be safe.",5

Tried to day trade on unsettled funds...learned about Regulation T today too...Sold stocks yesterday to get some cash to try for a day trade today. Little did I know that those proceeds need to sit for 3 days and clear. What I find the cruel twist is is that I can buy stocks with these proceeds, yet I cannot sell that stock until the funds clear. I got 100 shares of Trevena this morning, it was popping, I had smiles all around til the trade was halted by Trade King. I called them and they explained I could make the trade but I would violate Reg. T and have my account frozen for 90 days. I would have made a couple hundred bucks today, but instead I'm stuck with a stock that will probably contract after a huge pop. SHIT! 

Edit: Lots of great information being learned in this thread, thanks! to all who are providing technical advice out of the kindness of their hearts, I just applied to have a margin account instead of a cash account through TK. One more day before funds are settled and the stock is still up, so here's to hoping I don't pay to much for this mistake. 
Edit 2.0- Made the call yesterday and sold off at $10.20, haven't heard anything about getting a violation yet. Made a cool $140...could have made 30% but 15% will do just fine. Margin account has been finalized. Thanks again for the knowledge! ",56

Unfortunaly, Vanguard's website has been nothing but a nightmare. It's a complete broken disaster. Links that don't do anything, redirect loops every which way. The first time I filled out my application, I got to the very last page, signed, accepted terms, everything, and the very last button ""SUBMIT MY APPLICATION"" opened a loading window that NEVER CLOSED. I had to call them to figure out whether it even went through (it did not). So I started over, and the second time it told me it couldn't verify my identity so I had to mail my application in. Tried three or four more times over the next few days and it said the same thing (I'm guessing this is a security thing with the ID verification system), so I buckled and mailed it even though the year is 2015.

Now they've debited my $1000, which I ASSUME means my account has been opened, but now the website does nothing but send me into infinite redirect loops and is therefore *completely nonfunctional*.

What's the deal with these guys? This is honestly a really bad sign for me. A pack of walruses could build a better website, yet these guys are supposed to be in charge of hundreds of millions of dollars in assets. I can't manage my account right now. I can't invest my money.

Vanguard is highly promoted around here, so I was wondering what you guys have to say about this. Is the website always a complete piece of garbage? Is there any hope it will be fixed? I will be forced to go elsewhere if I am literally unable to use the website.

They are currently underway through phase 3 trials for a prostate drug. Read this here for the science and market potential:

http://www.smarteranalyst.com/2015/06/10/tokai-pharmaceuticals-inc-the-small-cap-biotech-with-the-billion-dollar-prostate-cancer-drug/

&gt; Management has announced that they will begin the ARMOR3-SV Phase 3 clinical trial in the second half of this year. The structure of the trial has been finalized and the FDA and EMA have both signed off on the design. The trial will enroll 148 patients with progressive metastatic CRPC with detectable AR-V7 expression. Patients will be randomized to treatment with either Galeterone or Xtandi. The primary endpoint is radiographic PFS (rPFS) with secondary endpoints of PSA response, OS, time to chemotherapy, and safety.

&gt; **It’s hard to find a Phase 3 clinical trial as de-risked as the one set-up by Tokai management. In my opinion, the chance of success here is nearly 100%.** Galeterone has been shown to be just as effective in patients with AR-V7 than without due to its numerous mechanisms of action while Xtandi is known to be ineffective in patients with AR-V7. The Johns Hopkins study showed that patients with AR-V7 expression had no PSA50 response, only 1.4 months of PSA progression free survival and 2.1 months of rPFS. In the Phase 2 Galeterone clinical trial 86% of patients with AR-V7 achieved PSA50 response translating to a 7.3 month PSA PFS.

&gt;Xu gave Takai an Outperform rating and a $44 price target. Xu acknowledged that “the development of a companion diagnostic to identify AR-V7 expression for the study enrollment, as well as FDA approval for this diagnostic, is a prerequisite to beginning this Phase III trial.” Thus, “finalizing and validating the assay is the next major milestone to be achieved in the development program,” in her opinion. This is the first time Xu has given a recommendation for Tokai.

&gt;Tokai’s flagship compound galeterone initially addresses a clear unmet medical need in prostate cancer, i.e. castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPR) patients with tumor-expressing androgen receptor (AR) split variants (AR-V7) for whom recently approved novel agents such as Zytiga and Xtandi are not expected to be effective. **We view Tokai shares as having significant upside potential (phase 3 start in the first half of 2015, pivotal data in the second half of 2015), given a clear/favorable regulatory pathway, a high probability of phase 3 success, sizeable market opportunity (addressing a key resistance mechanism to novel therapies) and no foreseeable competition.**

15-09-01,3j9pm3,"Alright, let's do an analysis of this turd GBSN!","Hey hey! 

First of all I wanna say I have basically zero interest in this company long term. I just think it provides a good example of how complicated the market can be and I want to try to put a value on it. My fundamental analysis is not the greatest as I'm 95% a technical trader, but I do know a bit...so let's see if we can get a discussion started. It should be educational for all. 

Ok so the initial thing that drew me to this stock is that the chart is just completely destroyed in the last couple weeks. Normally when I see a stock shed 80-90% of its value in just a couple weeks, it will snap back hard and provide a good quick trade especially if timed with a market or sector bounce (See CJES recently for what I mean). 

I was curious why GBSN dropped so much so I started reading and this 8K from this morning summarizes it nicely: 

http://biz.yahoo.com/e/150901/gbsn8-k.html

Ok ... in the most recent [10-Q](http://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/displayfilinginfo.aspx?FilingID=10858949-886-128837&amp;type=sect&amp;TabIndex=2&amp;dcn=0001564590-15-007096&amp;nav=1&amp;src=Yahoo) we have 7,289,688 shares outstanding. Add to that the 1,970,000 issued per this 8k after conversion of the Series E preferred stock, and 17,730,172 shares issued per the 8k after conversion of Series C warrants on a cashless basis, and you get the 26,998,860 shares listed as currently outstanding on the 8k. 

Now there are also still 2,181,250 shares of series E preferred stock out there, which according to the 8k can be converted to 4 shares each of common stock, so that's another 8,725,000 shares of common stock. There are also 18,643,040 series C warrants still outstanding, which are exerciseable either for cash at $2.55/share or cashless for common shares (at least that's how I am interpreting this, could be wrong). 

That said let's do some math: If the series E's are converted that would bring outstanding shares to 35,723,860. If the series C's were exercised completely in cash it would equate to $47,539,752 and if they were converted to common shares at the same ratio as what's in this 8k (approximately 6.41 shares per warrant), it would result in the issuance of 119,547,590 additional shares, bringing the total outstanding to 155,271,450 shares. 

At that dilution the stock right now would have a market cap of approximately 46.58m. On the surface, it looks like with only 7.2m shares outstanding per their most recent 10Q the stock is trading at only about 12-15% of its cash value. When you consider all the potential dilution, we have the potential for either a $47.5m cash outflow if all the series C warrants were exercised for cash, or a dilution of almost 150m shares. 

Now, this could all be totally wrong since like I said I'm not a fundamentals guy really and admittedly I have no idea how warrants even work, but does this sound right? If so, even at $0.30 the stock doesn't look very appealing since it has no earnings and only $15.27m in cash. Upon a 150m share dilution the stock would be worth $0.10 or so in cash only. If series C warrants were all exercised at $2.55 for cash, the company is basically bankrupt. 

So, what say ye? Discuss. ",12

AMD has been performing really poorly and has been for a long time. Bankruptcy looks likely within the next few years if this continues.

However AMD is the only true competitor against Nvidia and Intel.
A company like AMD going bankrupt would be anti competitive. Because the barrier to entry into gpu and cpu manufacturing is enormous it would be difficult for another company to fill AMD's gap. This would mean the growth of technology would stunt considerably.

So imagine a few years down the road AMD is about to go bankrupt. What happens? Does the government step in? Are they bought out by a different company? What other possibilities are there?

Yet, I get on here and read ""I just got out of college and I haven't invested my $10,000 saving in anything yet, waiting for the crash that of course I know is going to happen, trust me I took econ 101 my freshman year."" 

Congratulations, if the market crashes and you get in on the low (good luck timing that) then you'll perhaps make a sweet little return on the way back up. But you know what sucks while that market is recovering: fucking life. When the economy sucks your job security goes down, your friends (or even you) lose their jobs, and peoples lives suck, society is fucking depressed. Sure that 10K you invested might turn to 16K over 4 or 5 years, but who gives a shit. It's a few months pay for most of us. 

Obviously none of us have control on the markets, but I think it's a bit insensitive to truly hope for a crash. Sure you want to make that sweet sweet return, but Jesus Christ, you're also wishing misery on a bunch of folks. 

I'm not a bull or bear right now. Honestly this correction (maybe crash, I doubt it, but who really knows) has been reassuring to me. Nothing can go up forever. But I'm also a long term investor with no need for the cash I have invested. Seeing folks predict and openly hope for a crash is disconcerting. 2008 was for all intents and purposes a once in half century event, and I know I don't want to go through that for a long time.

15-09-02,3jawch,"Considering IRAs are not taxable when selling stocks, isn't it more worth it to make risky/frequent investments in IRAs vs brokerage accounts?","I have both IRA and brokerage accounts.  My regular brokerage account is much larger than my IRA.

I was wondering... if i'm going to be doing stuff like investing in individual stocks or making frequent buys/sells, isn't it more worth it to do it in the IRA account?  That way, my brokerage acct can hold the investments that i keep for 1 year to take capital gains benefit.

For instance, if I want to buy AAPL at a large dip to try to sell it shortly after in order to make a quick win... it would be better off if i did it in the IRA account to avoid taxable events.

Am i wrong?  Is this reasoning sound?

The reason i'm thinking about it, is because i'm thinking of consolidating my retirement accounts into vanguard.  But i'm considering that maybe I should move it to something like Scottrade so that I can do individual stock investments because of the reasoning above.",11

The market volatility hit, and I sold my shit about a week ago, because I wasn't feeling like taking a loss. (Already took a $400 loss on the NBG hype).

I was sitting on just over 10K in my Vanguard money market account, and got a bit tired of watching it do nothing. Today, I decided to pull the trigger, and throw it all into DWTI

Looking for a variety of opinions here. 

Recessions in the US occur roughly every 8 years. This is manifested globally. Whether the chicken or the egg come first is an argument of semantics, and relatively irrelevant. 

Where are we currently?

How long until an equities market sell off? Once that occurs, how long will funny-money stay in the bond market until that pops too? 2 months? Where would the majority of money go after that if not lost or pulled from the market?

People betting on a full-scale collapse are stupid. We have enough resources to start wars, and strong enough printing presses, to prevent dismal depressions. 

Are equities in their death-roll currently? Volatility, until massive off-sells?

--------------------------------------------------------------------
READ THE DUE DILIGENCE FIRST. If you make an investing decision without first educating yourself you will be sorely disappointed. If you decide to take a position, be smart, don’t go bonkers and drop your whole portfolio in it on a 50% spike. That’s pure idiocy and can and will result in substantial losses. There are many things you can’t predict or control for and as retail investors we can attempt to do thorough research and make educated decisions.
 
Given the recent market volatility, I have been searching for potential investments that have imminent catalysts with defined dates to trade around. Once a defined catalyst date is found, and to further minimize risk, I then look for some indications that the data release will be positive. Often times, companies run open-label studies or incorporate an adaptive trial design that allows them to have some insight into the safety and efficacy of their trials. Previous data releases, statements made during presentations, comments found in conference call transcripts, or recent insider buying are all tools that I use to gain greater insight into the nature of a company’s data. I believe I have found a company that embodies some of these characteristics, which will be presenting data next week.
 
Personal Trading Strategy: At the present time, I view this stock as short-term catalyst play, but will reassess my trading strategy once data is released. The company trades on the OTC and their current financial situation prevents me from considering this a long term play at the present time. There are a number of warrants that are close to being “in the money” which could generate substantial cash inflows for the company if the data presented is positive and other fundamental developments occur. Its situation is similar to that of AVXL and TPIV, in which the exercise of warrants created the funding to further fund clinical trials. It is severely under-valued by the market and if data is compelling, there exists the opportunity for substantial gains. Other companies, targeting similar indications, have market caps at 10x-15x’s greater than this company. Given their status on the OTC, please be advised of the risks. Due to the impending catalyst and anticipated trading window, I will provide a shorter version of my due diligence.
 
Glioblastoma:  Here is a brief description of glioblastoma and the current standard of care.
 
“According to the Cancer Research Institute, Glioblastomas are one of the most aggressive types of brain cancer, with most patients failing to reach the one year survival mark and few living to see three years following diagnosis. For newly diagnosed GBM patients treated under the current standard of care, median progression free survival is 6.9 months and median overall survival is 14.6 months. Only 25% of newly diagnosed patients survive for 24 months and less than 10% survive more than 5 years. With approximately 16,000 newly diagnosed patients and 10,000 deaths from the disease in the US alone, there is a dire need to improve the standard of care.”
 
“The current standard of care consists of Temodar as the chemotherapeutic agent in chemoradiative therapy as a first line treatment. Temodar received approval in 2005 for the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM on the basis that it improved overall survival by 2.5 months. In 2009, the FDA approved Avastin as a second line treatment for patients with disease progression following treatment with temodar. Avastin's approval was based off an improvement in progression free survival.”
 
With 16,000 newly diagnosed patients every year, the GBM market is measured in the billions.

Ownership: Insiders and institutions own approximately 11,082,065 shares or 29.8% of the company. In the recent offering, Sabby Management purchased almost 3 million shares and warrants. If you would like to see a comprehensive list of who owns shares in the company, it can be found on their most recent registration statement.

Catalyst:  Interim Phase 2 Glioblastoma data and an update on “corporate partnership progress” will be presented at the Rodman &amp; Renshaw Investors Conference on September 9th. The top-line data readout for the P2 trial is in Q1 2016.
 
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/genspera-present-rodman-renshaw-17th-123000950.html
 
This data was initially scheduled to be presented at the Society for Neuro-Oncology meeting on November 19th 2015. However, the company recently decided to present the data months earlier at an investor conference as well as provide a “partnership” update. This is an interesting change, but I believe that this change in data release and update may be a significant value driver for the company. The CEO has made clear that it intends to partner another one of its products for liver cancer by the end of the year and will likely provide some insight into this process on the 9th. Since this announcement, there has been a substantial increase in the trading volume.
For those involved in AVXL from the beginning, you know that their data was initially scheduled to be released in September, but they moved the date up to July. We all know how that ended up and this appears to be a very similar situation with GenSpera.
 
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/genspera-phase-ii-abstract-accepted-123000953.html 
 
Financial Position: As of June 30, 2015, Genspera had $121k in cash.  However, in July 2015, the company issued a private placement of 3,591,278 shares of common stock, the majority of which were purchased by Sabby Management, which netted them an additional $2.2 million.  Each unit of the offering consisted of one share of common stock at $.70, one warrant at $.70 that expires in 18 months, and one warrant at $.80 that expires in 5 years.   The company burns roughly $1.3 million per quarter, and thus, per the company’s 10Q, they expect this cash to fund their operations for 3-6 months. 
 
Prior the offering at June 30, 2015, the company had a total of 18,549,724 warrants outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $1.51.  When adding an additional 7 million warrants from this offering, the company is left with roughly 25 million warrants outstanding for an average exercise price of approximately $1.30 per share.
 
Interestingly, in the most recent offering, only $2.2M in cash was raised, which is a paltry sum for a life sciences company. Possible explanations for the size of this offering could include: 1) They were unable find buyers for their shares, 2) They anticipate a partnership in the near-term with upfront cash to fund operations (more on that later), 3) They anticipate share price appreciation in the coming months that will allow the exercise of outstanding warrants, or 4) A combination of these factors.   
 
Company Background: Typically I would like to provide a summary of the company and what it has going on. However, the well renowned and respected Seeking Alpha &amp; Zack’s contributor Jason Napodano, CFA, recently completed a thorough, non-biased review of the company, clinical development, and market potential. I am not going to “re-invent the wheel” as he delivers a superior product and thus, I strongly suggest that his analysis be reviewed.  
 
 
http://scr.zacks.com/files/Zacks-GNSZ-Initiation-June-2015-_-NapodanoBautz_v002_n63gvp.pdf
 
I would like, however, to present some of the “tells” that I have utilized when creating my thesis and investment decision. First, the company moved the interim glioblastoma data release to an investor conference from a scientific conference later in the year. Presenting data at these types of conferences is uncommon and thus the recent announcement piqued my interest. Why would a company move up a data release and want to present this data to a room full of investors?  You don’t fill a room full of investors and then present “bad” data. Second, the CEO has been dropping hints of partnership for months. The phase 2 liver cancer trial completed earlier this year and the company has repeatedly stated that they will be continuing this program with a partner. Now, I take CEO statements of partnerships with a healthy dose of salt, but GenSpera’s CEO has taken actions and made statements that suggest a partnership may be imminent. In July, the CEO made two posts on his company’s blog discussing their rationale for partnership as well as the company’s recent partnership activities. One quote of particular interest is as follows:
 
“GenSpera has been actively engaged in this partnering process for over two years since the beginning of Phase II clinical trials in liver cancer. We started early because we knew that comfort in the validity of our science and clinical data would be generated as potential partners could see data develop and become familiar with our management team. It is personally gratifying to me to learn that there are well-respected companies in our industry who also see the commercial potential for mipsagargin, and are closely tracking our clinical trials.”

On August 12, 2015, Craig Dionne, chief executive officer of GenSpera, Inc. (the “Company”) participated as a guest on Reddit’s “Ask Me Anything.” A transcript of this can be found below, but I would like to highlight some of his comments.

Q: “When are you planning to begin Phase 3 Liver Trials?”
A: “We plan to begin the next liver study in late 2015 or early 2016 depending upon where we stand with a potential corporate partner at that time.”
Q: “Can you explain how your brain cancer trials are progressing?”
A: “…We saw such good data and we have  announced the expanded enrollment and the second stage is underway.”
 
These statements, coupled with the change in data release date suggests that investors may hear significant information at the Rodman &amp; Renshaw conference. I firmly believe the data presented will be positive and remain cautiously optimistic on the development of a partnership. Please keep in mind that biotech CEO’s often talk a big story.

Summary: The defined data release at the Rodman &amp; Renshaw conference on September 9th provides an excellent opportunity for investors. The company has decided to move the data release forward two months and present the data at a conference of potential investors.  I would hardly expect the company to do so if the data they have so far received is anything less than stellar. This suggests to me, that investors will likely receive a positive press release announcing the data on either September 9th or 10th. The company has also made it clear that they are currently seeking a partnership and have been in these discussion for two years. After reviewing SEC forms, corporate presentations, and earning reports, at no time has the CEO made reference to updating investors on “corporate partnership progress.” This change could possibly indicate that some progress has been made and a partnership may be signed in the near future. Positive data alone could be a significant value driver and partnership could add additional further momentum to any share price movement. GenSpera has already presented positive results in liver cancer and it is very likely to present positive data for glioblastoma.  Liver cancer and glioblastoma represent a market in excess of $2.5 billion, and with a paltry market cap of $25 million, the company remains grossly undervalued and unappreciated by the market. 
 
Final Thoughts: GenSpera provides an excellent trading opportunity in the coming days. Market volatility continues and the key to making money during these periods is to minimize risk and find opportunities with a high chance of success. With a defined catalyst date, investors and longer term shareholders have the potential to make nice returns, given that the data and information presented is positive. As I have detailed above, there are strong indicators that GenSpera will be presenting positive data as well as other fundamental developments. GenSpera does have its merits , but their current cash situation prevents me from generating a long-term thesis at this time, though this could change in the coming weeks. Interestingly, GenSpera is in a roughly similar situation to AVXL and TPIV prior to their substantial price appreciation.  AVXL and TPIV both possessed adequate funds, but were hardly in a position to fund further clinical trials without the execution their warrants. However, much like GenSpera, they had a warrant structure that provided more funds with their share price appreciation. As evidenced in previous trades, buying well below the warrant execution price, in severely undervalued companies, with significant catalysts on deck, is a good bet for a profitable trade.

15-09-02,3jdbcy,shorting volatility and losing tons of money,"I am shorting a single January 2016 volatility contract which has already put me $5,000 in the hole. The current price is 23.8 and it was as low as 17 just a month ago. The quextion is: if the vix remains elevated, will the far-dated month contracts rise even if the market doesn't fall. I know in 2012 volatility fell dramatically, but what if volatility remains high.  Should I wait to just cut the losses on this?

Here is what is really pissing me off: the Sep. one is dropping like the stone but  the others are hardly down at all:

I guess people are worried about longer-term volatility

The werid thing is this is a conversavtive long dated contract and I still lose tons of money. I had the option to short as many as 4 of these, and If I did I would be down $20k...now I see how people go broke in the futures market. And we're talking long-dated ones.

I initially hated this pick and bashed it a little.  Honestly, I don't know if my opinion has changed a whole lot since then, but wanted to get some feedback from others.  With picks like $TBEV running for crazy gains against all logic, I figure why not this shit pick?

So here's what I know.  The company seems to be into ""green"" energy and has deals going in Mexico.  There were several PRs earlier in the year, but no updates really, so who knows.  About a month ago, a PR dropped saying that the company issued a LOI to acquire two media companies.  There is supposed to be another PR to update on this situation.  Everyone seems to be expecting it this week or next.  Another PR says that the company will not do a reverse split in 2015.  There is also a capital investment group who holds roughly 9.5% of the company.

Now for the shaky stuff.  The companies website lists IR groups that have never represented the company.  The company is based in Florida but incorporated in Nevada.  There are no updates on previous projects really.  The group that holds the 9.5% look shady at best.

Now for the yolo stuff.  I got in at 0.0002 and we're now at 0.0005.  There seems to be a fair amount of talk on other boards about this and it could be another $TBEV.

I welcome any thoughts wsb might have.

15-09-02,3jdg3t,Small questions,"Hi,

As you can see at this website, the price for a share of Asus is around 290 Taiwanese dollars: http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?ticker=2357:TT

However, when I check at this website, the share price is around 47 US dollars: 
http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/asuuy

1 Taiwanese dollar is roughly 0.030793 US dollars. If I take the price of 290 and multiply it with this number, I get a US dollar share price of around $9. Which website is right?

I would also like to know if it is (easily) possible for an investor from Europe to invest in such a stock, or that of HTC for example, as they are not traded on one of the markets in this continent (neither for USA I think).

Lastly, I have a question regarding brokers. I am from Europe and in a few months I want to open a broker account. I have heard that Interactive Brokers is the cheapest broker. I don't want broker advice, just want to make trades. However, the company is American and I don't know much about it. How is the company regarded in the US? How safe is it for a European investor to have stocks there? If the company goes bankrupt, can I be reasonably sure to get back 90%+ of my money back (I am pretty sure that I read this regarding previous broker bankruptcies, although I am not sure if it is the same percentage for everyone or if only those with much money invested lose some of it).

I am trying to find a good broker but I am not feeling safe enough. How do people with $1 million in stocks do it? How do people with most of their money in stocks do it? Do they check their broker's income statement every year to see if their broker is still going to survive? Is it safe to put 80%+ of your money in a broker account/stocks, assuming your chosen stock investments are worthwhile?

Thank you for your time.",5

--------------------------------------------------------------------
READ THE DUE DILIGENCE FIRST. If you make an investing decision without first educating yourself you will be sorely disappointed. If you decide to take a position, be smart, don’t go bonkers and drop your whole portfolio in it on a 50% spike. That’s pure idiocy and can and will result in substantial losses. There are many things you can’t predict or control for and as retail investors we can attempt to do thorough research and make educated decisions.
 
Given the recent market volatility, I have been searching for potential investments that have imminent catalysts with defined dates to trade around. Once a defined catalyst date is found, and to further minimize risk, I then look for some indications that the data release will be positive. Often times, companies run open-label studies or incorporate an adaptive trial design that allows them to have some insight into the safety and efficacy of their trials. Previous data releases, statements made during presentations, comments found in conference call transcripts, or recent insider buying are all tools that I use to gain greater insight into the nature of a company’s data. I believe I have found a company that embodies some of these characteristics, which will be presenting data next week.
 
Personal Trading Strategy: At the present time, I view this stock as short-term catalyst play, but will reassess my trading strategy once data is released. The company trades on the OTC and their current financial situation prevents me from considering this a long term play at the present time. There are a number of warrants that are close to being “in the money” which could generate substantial cash inflows for the company if the data presented is positive and other fundamental developments occur. Its situation is similar to that of AVXL and TPIV, in which the exercise of warrants created the funding to further fund clinical trials. It is severely under-valued by the market and if data is compelling, there exists the opportunity for substantial gains. Other companies, targeting similar indications, have market caps at 10x-15x’s greater than this company. Given their status on the OTC, please be advised of the risks. Due to the impending catalyst and anticipated trading window, I will provide a shorter version of my due diligence.
 
Glioblastoma:  Here is a brief description of glioblastoma and the current standard of care.
 
“According to the Cancer Research Institute, Glioblastomas are one of the most aggressive types of brain cancer, with most patients failing to reach the one year survival mark and few living to see three years following diagnosis. For newly diagnosed GBM patients treated under the current standard of care, median progression free survival is 6.9 months and median overall survival is 14.6 months. Only 25% of newly diagnosed patients survive for 24 months and less than 10% survive more than 5 years. With approximately 16,000 newly diagnosed patients and 10,000 deaths from the disease in the US alone, there is a dire need to improve the standard of care.”
 
“The current standard of care consists of Temodar as the chemotherapeutic agent in chemoradiative therapy as a first line treatment. Temodar received approval in 2005 for the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM on the basis that it improved overall survival by 2.5 months. In 2009, the FDA approved Avastin as a second line treatment for patients with disease progression following treatment with temodar. Avastin's approval was based off an improvement in progression free survival.”
 
With 16,000 newly diagnosed patients every year, the GBM market is measured in the billions.

Catalyst:  Interim Phase 2 Glioblastoma data and an update on “corporate partnership progress” will be presented at the Rodman &amp; Renshaw Investors Conference on September 9th. The top-line data readout for the P2 trial is in Q1 2016.
 
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/genspera-present-rodman-renshaw-17th-123000950.html
 
This data was initially scheduled to be presented at the Society for Neuro-Oncology meeting on November 19th 2015. However, the company recently decided to present the data months earlier at an investor conference as well as provide a “partnership” update. This is an interesting change, but I believe that this change in data release and update may be a significant value driver for the company. The CEO has made clear that it intends to partner another one of its products for liver cancer by the end of the year and will likely provide some insight into this process on the 9th. Since this announcement, there has been a substantial increase in the trading volume.
For those involved in AVXL from the beginning, you know that their data was initially scheduled to be released in September, but they moved the date up to July. We all know how that ended up and this appears to be a very similar situation with GenSpera.
 
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/genspera-phase-ii-abstract-accepted-123000953.html 
 
Financial Position: As of June 30, 2015, Genspera had $121k in cash.  However, in July 2015, the company issued a private placement of 3,591,278 shares of common stock, the majority of which were purchased by Sabby Management, which netted them an additional $2.2 million.  Each unit of the offering consisted of one share of common stock at $.70, one warrant at $.70 that expires in 18 months, and one warrant at $.80 that expires in 5 years.   The company burns roughly $1.3 million per quarter, and thus, per the company’s 10Q, they expect this cash to fund their operations for 3-6 months. 
 
Prior the offering at June 30, 2015, the company had a total of 18,549,724 warrants outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $1.51.  When adding an additional 7 million warrants from this offering, the company is left with roughly 25 million warrants outstanding for an average exercise price of approximately $1.30 per share.
 
Interestingly, in the most recent offering, only $2.2M in cash was raised, which is a paltry sum for a life sciences company. Possible explanations for the size of this offering could include: 1) They were unable find buyers for their shares, 2) They anticipate a partnership in the near-term with upfront cash to fund operations (more on that later), 3) They anticipate share price appreciation in the coming months that will allow the exercise of outstanding warrants, or 4) A combination of these factors.   
 
Company Background: Typically I would like to provide a summary of the company and what it has going on. However, the well renowned and respected Seeking Alpha &amp; Zack’s contributor Jason Napodano, CFA, recently completed a thorough, non-biased review of the company, clinical development, and market potential. I am not going to “re-invent the wheel” as he delivers a superior product and thus, I strongly suggest that his analysis be reviewed.

Q: “When are you planning to begin Phase 3 Liver Trials?”
A: “We plan to begin the next liver study in late 2015 or early 2016 depending upon where we stand with a potential corporate partner at that time.”
Q: “Can you explain how your brain cancer trials are progressing?”
A: “…We saw such good data and we have  announced the expanded enrollment and the second stage is underway.”
 
These statements, coupled with the change in data release date suggests that investors may hear significant information at the Rodman &amp; Renshaw conference. I firmly believe the data presented will be positive and remain cautiously optimistic on the development of a partnership. Please keep in mind that biotech CEO’s often talk a big story.

Summary: The defined data release at the Rodman &amp; Renshaw conference on September 9th provides an excellent opportunity for investors. The company has decided to move the data release forward two months and present the data at a conference of potential investors.  I would hardly expect the company to do so if the data they have so far received is anything less than stellar. This suggests to me, that investors will likely receive a positive press release announcing the data on either September 9th or 10th. The company has also made it clear that they are currently seeking a partnership and have been in these discussion for two years. After reviewing SEC forms, corporate presentations, and earning reports, at no time has the CEO made reference to updating investors on “corporate partnership progress.” This change could possibly indicate that some progress has been made and a partnership may be signed in the near future. Positive data alone could be a significant value driver and partnership could add additional further momentum to any share price movement. GenSpera has already presented positive results in liver cancer and it is very likely to present positive data for glioblastoma.  Liver cancer and glioblastoma represent a market in excess of $2.5 billion, and with a paltry market cap of $25 million, the company remains grossly undervalued and unappreciated by the market. 
 
Final Thoughts: GenSpera provides an excellent trading opportunity in the coming days. Market volatility continues and the key to making money during these periods is to minimize risk and find opportunities with a high chance of success. With a defined catalyst date, investors and longer term shareholders have the potential to make nice returns, given that the data and information presented is positive. As I have detailed above, there are strong indicators that GenSpera will be presenting positive data as well as other fundamental developments. GenSpera does have its merits , but their current cash situation prevents me from generating a long-term thesis at this time, though this could change in the coming weeks. Interestingly, GenSpera is in a roughly similar situation to AVXL and TPIV prior to their substantial price appreciation.  AVXL and TPIV both possessed adequate funds, but were hardly in a position to fund further clinical trials without the execution their warrants. However, much like GenSpera, they had a warrant structure that provided more funds with their share price appreciation. As evidenced in previous trades, buying well below the warrant execution price, in severely undervalued companies, with significant catalysts on deck, is a good bet for a profitable trade.

15-09-02,3jds88,Former Bank CEO Nets Prison Time for Bailout Fraud,"Ebrahim Shabudin, 66, of Moraga, California, was sentenced today to 97 months in prison for his role in a securities fraud scheme and other corporate fraud offenses stemming from the failure of United Commercial Bank (UCB). The sentencing brings to a close one of the most significant prosecutions to arise out of the 2008 financial crisis.  

UCB was founded in 1974. As of 2007, it was a subsidiary of UCBH Holdings (OTCMKTS: UBHGQ). United Commercial Bank was closed by regulators on November 6, 2009; it was the 120th U.S. bank to fail in 2009, and it had $11.2 billion in assets at the time of the bank failure.
Shabudin was the Chief Operating Officer and Chief Credit Officer at UCB in 2008 and 2009.  Shabudin was the second most senior officer in executive management at UCB after former Chief Executive Officer Thomas Shiu-Kit (“Tommy”) Wu. 

On Nov. 6, 2009, UCB was taken over by the FDIC. With over $10.9 billion in assets, UCB’s failure was the ninth largest failure since 2007 of a bank insured by the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund, according to the FDIC. In 2013, the FDIC estimated that total losses for UCB would exceed $1.1 billion. Through 2014, however, with the recovery of the United States economy, the FDIC now estimates the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund to be approximately $677 million. 

On Nov. 14, 2008, the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) provided approximately $298 million in federal funds to UCB during the financial crisis. Shabudin was charged with conspiring with others within the bank to falsify key bank records as part of a scheme to conceal millions of dollars in losses and falsely inflate the bank’s financial statements. Among the records Shabudin was charged with falsifying were those filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and FDIC related to the third and fourth quarters of 2008 describing UCB’s so-called Allowance for Loan Losses. Also falsified were documents relating to UCB’s quarterly and year-end earnings per share as announced by the bank to the investing public. On March 25, 2015, following a six-week trial before the U.S. District Judge Jeffrey S. White, a jury found Shabudin guilty of seven crimes related to the scheme.

“As the Chief Operating Officer and Chief Credit Officer of United Commercial Bank, Ebrahim Shabudin presided over one of the largest securities fraud schemes in the history of this district,” said U.S. Melinda Attorney Haag. “His prison term should serve as a warning to persons who believe that complex commercial crime will not be detected and prosecuted.  I am proud of all the hard work of the attorneys and staff of this office and of our federal partners that resulted in this successful prosecution.”

On Dec. 9, 2014, Chief Financial Officer Craig S. On for UCB pleaded guilty to one count of Conspiracy to Make a Materially False and Misleading Statement to an Accountant. On Oct. 7, 2014, the bank’s Senior Vice President, Thomas Yu, pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit false bank entries, reports and transactions related to his preparation of false and misleading reports. Both On and Yu await sentencing.

Sabudin will begin his term in federal prison on 1 November, 2015.",1

15-09-02,3je4sm,$GILD shares are cheap,"Gilead (NASDAQ:[GILD](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=gild&amp;fr=uh3_finance_web&amp;uhb=uhb2)) ended [2014](http://investors.gilead.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=69964&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=2013213) with an impressive increase in its top and bottom lines. Product sales doubled, compared to the prior fiscal year, and non-GAAP earnings per share more than quadrupled. Gilead's fiscal 2015 is carrying the same momentum. The second-quarter earnings report revealed that product sales have increased significantly from the prior-year period, aided by the performance of Gilead's Hepatitis C drug Harvoni. The successful quarter led Gilead to raise its guidance for the fiscal year of 2015.

Any investor that is aware of Gilead knows that one of its most successful products is the company's hepatitis C treatment Harvoni; hepatitis C medicines from Gilead account for ~60% of its revenue. Though we think the convenience and efficacy of Harvoni is simply hard-to-beat as it relates to a hep-C cure, AbbVie (NYSE:[ABBV](http://finance.yahoo.com/q;_ylt=Asap2aUAoWiQzWHbz6kpOywnv7gF?s=abbv&amp;uhb=uhb2&amp;fr=uh3_finance_vert_gs)) offers a substitute for Gilead's treatment in its Viekira Pak. Merck (NYSE:[MRK](http://finance.yahoo.com/q;_ylt=Ahgd6G_lY6pkd8wF6PAJ3k4nv7gF?uhb=uhb2&amp;fr=uh3_finance_vert_gs&amp;type=2button&amp;s=mrk)) and others are also active in the hep-C arena. Still, in any case, the global hep-C market is large enough for a number of players, in our view, suggesting that even under a scenario of share loss, Gilead will still be in good shape.

To the excitement of income investors, Gilead [announced](http://investors.gilead.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=69964&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=2013218) its first-ever dividend as its fiscal 2014 ended. A $0.43 per share dividend and a $15 billion share buyback program were initiated. Growth potential in the capital returned to shareholders remains substantial, particularly in light of the company's cash-generating prowess. From our perspective, Gilead's claim on the global hep-C market is rock solid, contributes to its [Economic Castle](http://www.valuentum.com/articles/Valuentums_Economic_Castle_Rating) rating of 'Very Attractive,' and we think investors are getting its pipeline for free within the context of our valuation model. Let's take a closer look at Gilead's other investment considerations and derive a fair value estimate for shares.

**Investment Highlights**

• Gilead's primary areas of focus include HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B and C, serious cardiovascular/metabolic and respiratory conditions. The firm's drug Sovaldi and its successor Harvoni, a once-daily oral treatment of HCV infection, are its primary product drivers and comprise a large portion of antiviral product sales. Complera/Eviplera and Stribild--single tablet regimens for HIV--are also experiencing nice sales expansion. Sovaldi, Complera/Eviplera and Stribild were launched in 2012/2013, 2012/2013 and 2011, respectively, and Harvoni was approved in October 2014. Gilead's pipeline also offers tremendous opportunities.

• According to the World Health Organization, 130-150 million people globally have chronic hepatitis C infection, and a significant number of those who are chronically infected will develop liver cirrhosis or liver cancer, with as many as 350,000-500,000 people dying each year from hepatitis C-related liver diseases. The HCV market is vastly underserved, providing long-term opportunities for Gilead.

• Harvoni's efficacy, by combining the NS5A inhibitor ledipasvir with the nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir (Solvadi), is so impressive that it can achieve HCV cure rates in the range of 94%-99%. This efficacy will be difficult for any competing therapy to better.

• Though we think Gilead is operating in a rational oligopoly in the HCV market, revenue erosion is a key risk. JNJ's (NYSE:JNJ) Janssen's Olysio and AbbVie's Viekira Pak are two rivals in the HCV market, and Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX) continues to pressure drug providers on price. This can't be ignored.

• Gilead has started paying a dividend, but that doesn't mean the company won't be active with respect to acquisitions in the future, and it certainly doesn't mean that it doesn't have future opportunities for investment within its pipeline. For a company that owns the cure for hep-C, we can only imagine what's next. We're excited just thinking about it.

**Economic Profit Analysis**

In our opinion, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Gilead Sciences' 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 55.4%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.4%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT.

**Cash Flow Analysis**

Free cash flow generation has been outstanding at Gilead Sciences in recent years. Firms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Gilead Sciences' free cash flow margin has averaged about 34.7% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG.

The free cash flow measure is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Gilead Sciences, cash flow from operations increased about 301% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 40% over the same time period.

**Valuation Analysis**

This is the culmination of our analysis. Below we outline our valuation assumptions and derive a fair value estimate for shares.

Our discounted cash flow model indicates that Gilead Sciences' shares are worth between $129-$193 each. Shares are currently trading at ~$102, well below the lower bound of our fair value range. This indicates that we feel there is significant upside potential associated with shares at this time.

The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's LOW ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $161 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 21.9 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 16.4 times last year's EBITDA.

Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 7.9% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 43.7%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 73%, which is above Gilead Sciences' trailing 3-year average.

Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.7% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Gilead Sciences, we use a 10.4% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.

**Margin of Safety Analysis**

Our discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $161 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.

Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. We think the firm is attractive below $129 per share, but quite expensive above $193 per share. 

**Wrapping Things Up**

We think Gilead Sciences is a fantastic company. It generates free cash flow at a tremendous rate, and has one of the most effective drugs with great potential in the huge HCV market. Rival drugs may pressure prices, and therefore impede the pace of long-term revenue expansion, however.

Nevertheless, we think there is significant long-term opportunities present for Gilead, and on the basis of its significant undervaluation, we think investors are getting the company's pipeline and potential within its acquisition program for free. Even assuming modest long-term top-line growth, Gilead Sciences is undervalued. Though shares have had a mighty run in recent years, the company's technical indicators aren't terrible, and shares are trading at relatively low earnings multiples compared to its peers.

Gilead Sciences currently registers a 9 on the [Valuentum Buying Index.](http://www.valuentum.com/articles/20110622)

But I have been recommended before, read online and did a little bit of research on some of the bigger companies and it looks really positive.  Is it possibly due to oil being cheaper for airline companies to purchase for the flights?  I heard that may not be the case because most companies have set prices on contracts for oil, so any price differences wouldn't be reflected in recent terms.  Or maybe its because they just have already that big of a foothold in their market that they won't be going anywhere any time soon so people are optimistic?

One time I didn't even realize I had bought call options for AAPL (that's Apple computer Inc. if you don't know, they made the iPhone5 and invented online music) but my brokerage was giving me the option to ""sell to open.""

15-09-02,3jf93p,$ATEC DD -- .57 -- NASDAQ,"_**THIS DD IS BEING MARKED AS FAILED AND CLOSED**_

In Q3 ATEC announced their earnings fell from the previous quarter.  ATEC subsequently filed for confidentiality  on two loans taken out on March 2014.   Hiding loan details is a shady thing to do and increases the risk associated with this company over and above what I would consider acceptable even for a penny play.  As such I am marking the play closed and failed, despite the fact that some people did make money on ATEC if they shorted the stock because of the NASDAQ listing.

_**THIS DD IS BEING MARKED AS FAILED AND CLOSED**_


TL;DR: This is an oversold company that has probably hit bottom, but will drift until the next earnings report.  By the 4th quarter the share price should recover back to its $1.40 range (a .90c gain) if the company's guidance holds true.  This is a reasonable six month play.

-------------------------------------------------

**Warning**: This company will be placed on the non-compliance list after September the 4th.   You should not consider this stock until after this has been digested as it will further weigh the stock price and may provide a better buying opportunity.
-

**The company**:

A biotech company focusing on spinal implants, Alphatec Holdings played comfortably in the $1.40 range until August 4th when it reported a loss of [4 cents a share (3.9 million)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphatec-reports-2q-loss-222447357.html).  The company attributed this to missing sales targets in the US and the strong dollar affecting international profits.   The missed sales was attributed to training a new sales force to cover the 90% of surgeons that were not covered before.  The company likened this to a tax that had to be paid, but really its more of an investment (Not as many people selling this quarter but 2-3 times more selling the next).  In July the company received a FDA notice about quality control in one of its acquisitions and the issue should be resolved without incident.  All weighed on the sell-off.

-

They are introducing two new products that should show up in revenues the next 2 quarters however in 2016 their products may be usurped by AMDA if AMDA's silicon intrude product is approved and proves superior.  But that risk is at least a year away at this point and this DD considers only a 6 month play.

-

Outsourcing 100 employees so this cost is a drag on revenue until the end of the year although costs may go down to compensate for this one time expense.

-

8.9 unrestricted cash on hand.  An additional 4.6 that's allocated to a settlement with OrthoTec.  Has debt of 76 million and will have $3 million in interest as a drag until the end of the year.   Added ~$10 million in debt last quarter to pay for their rebuilding.  

-

The company expects better revenue and profits in the second half of the year based on larger sales force becoming productive and their new Arsenal line revenue starting to show up in financials.  Management strongly believes in the direction they are taking the company: 

* COO purchased 30,000 shares 8/24
* General Councel 3,500 shares on 8/20
* COO purchased 30,000 shares 8/20
* A Director purchased 30,000 shares 8/14
* CEO purchased 35,000 shares on 8/12
* CFO purchased 13,000 shares on 8/11
* President purchased 30,000 shares on 8/11

Note these insider transactions do indicate the company is not in acquisition talks.  There were similar purchases in may.

-

Float is 64m.
Short Interest is 2.6m.

**Catalysts**:

* 3rd quarter ER: should show improving sales and declining losses (perhaps a small profit with the new product pipeline just ramping up)
* 4th quarter ER: should show improving sales and a profit that could exceed guidance if the new pipeline proves lucrative)

-

This is an earnings bet.   If the next quarter can show the company is back on track or at least close to getting back the share price should rebound into the dollar range.  If their new product line is successful enough to impact q3 revenue the share price may fully recover in anticipation of even better q4 results.   After q4 with declining offshoring expenses, a larger sales force and new products its possible this stock will begin trading back in the $2-$3 range.



-

**Risks**:

* Low volume stock!  Use limits to buy and sell, use stops only with limits or your market order may reach into the pennies to sell.   Be aware that if things go wrong it may be difficult to extract yourself if you make a significant investment.

* Because of the low volume this stock is subject to manipulation.  Because of the larger float and lack of substantial drivers, it's not as attractive as a pump and dump but it may still happen.

* NASDAQ non-compliance may drop the stock price into the .40s at least temporarily, or because it is so over-sold maybe not.  The company will have two 180 day extensions to get the share price over $1.00 for ten days, a goal which they can easily meet without a reverse split.

* May face competition on their product line from AMDA's silicon nitrade product if its approved by the FDA in the next 5 months.  AMDA has already lined up OEM suppliers for its product and is already competing with ATEC overseas which may start impacting $ATEC's revenues and profits.

* Because of the depressed price, expect resistance as the stock climbs as longs from the $1.40 level seek to escape with manageable losses.  This thing probably won't skyrocket but it should climb.

-

**CONCLUSION**:

This is a fairly low risk six month hold with a return on investment of 100-200% (higher than 125% if their new products appear successful).

-

**Disclosure**: I do not have a stake in this company.  This report was compiled because someone asked for it and DD is kinda a hobby.

-

As always -- do your own DD.   Just because an internet YOLO yahoo says a stock will probably go up doesn't mean it will, or that it will in the expected time-line.   Invest only what you can afford to lose.

&gt;Although the economy isn't ready for the kind of traditional rate-hike cycle of past eras -- one that includes increases at quasi-automatic intervals and that returns rates to the historical average policy level -- the current domestic economic conditions would justify (and have justified) a liftoff from the exceptionally low floor of zero percent.

&gt;The difficulty facing the Fed isn’t just the weaknesses in the global economy, but also the uncertainty about how its policy actions could end up indirectly undermining domestic growth, in particular by amplifying international financial instability and, therefore, the threat of adverse spill back from outside U.S. borders.

&gt;There is little doubt that the emerging world, led by China, is slowing, and in a manner that is unlikely to be offset by an acceleration of European and U.S. growth. There also is concern about whether the recent turmoil in emerging-markets financial assets, including the stunningly disorderly currency depreciations, could extend to the real economy -- first within a systemically important emerging nations (such as Brazil, China, Korea, Russia and others), then spreading to an advanced nation.",1

Because it's not that much, I was looking into Robinhood because it does not charge per transaction. Now I'm starting to become skeptical, as if it is too good to be true. So two questions:

1: Is Robinhood actually 100% free? If so, why would anyone choose a competitor like scott trade or etrade that charges?

2: I know very little about stocks, so this might sound dumb. But let's say I buy $5,000 worth of stocks in Robinhood (or etrade, or scott trade, etc.) and a month later the broker I used to buy the stock goes out of business. What happens to my stocks? Do they get forwarded to another broker? Am I forced to sell them on the spot?

On Aug 24th it shot down to $92 (52w low) and closed in the green.  Since then, the stock has been moving from a congestion pattern to a consolidation pattern.  Not to mention, the MACD is -3 and RSI under 50.

15-09-03,3jiul0,"BLFS Update 3 -- Updating our coverage, new TP, New catalysts &amp; concerns","Firstly, we (/u/FercPolo) and I would like to thank those whom supported us and bought BLFS at the 2-2.30 levels. We hope you made money on the pop and congratulate you. Most recently BLFS observed a 50% rise in stock price attributed to efficacy of its product in helping a partner reach primary phase 3 endpoints. We sold out of our entire position at the 3.20s mark. This netted us a profit of ~50%.

**Introduction to the company:**

BioLife Solutions, Inc. develops, manufactures, and markets patented hypothermic storage and cryopreservation solutions for cells and tissues in the United States. The companys products are serum-free and protein-free solutions, which are formulated to reduce preservation-induced, delayed-onset cell damage, and death. 

BLFS generates income from its coldchain and cryo storage mediums. It expects to significantly increase its revenues through **Biologistex**.

**What has happened since our initial coverage:**

We saw earnings come in at about consensus. We also did not observe significant news regarding Ebola.

**Cash position update:**

It is important to cover this as BLFS is mostly an equity firm.

The cash position shrunk about 1.7m while liabilities also shrunk.

Our takeaway here is that the company spent less than previous quarters because something is completed. This is covered below.


**What we expect to develop from here:**

We believe that BLFS released [this news release](http://www.biolifesolutions.com/biolife-investors/regenerative-medicine/biolife-solutions-customer-tigenix-phase-3-clinical-trial-meets-primary-endpoint/) to not just pump the stock price and make us rich, but to sneak a link to the [biologistex homepage](http://www.biologistex.net/). We believe (hope) that BLFS has also completed its initial beta cloud-solution for its Biologistex containers, and that those items are what the past 3 quarters spends are attributable to; with the decrease in expenditure attributable to completion.


We had not seen this before. This gives us immense confidence in the direction of BLFS. In the earnings call, Mr. Rice had not given guidance on Biologistex. But this shows a sales number, an e-mail. and a picture of the actual product. We expect more news out about Biologistex and a possible surprise regarding early adopters during the [Mesa Stem Cell conference](http://stemcellmeetingonthemesa.com/)

It is interesting to note that BioLife Solutions is a Gold sponsor at the conference. The conference has many companies in attendance. We will be giving out a report regarding 2 of them as well.



**Concerns**

We are concerned that BLFS may need to raise cash in the short term through either a preferred stock offering, or debt issue. We do not believe that BLFS will pursue a dilutive offering. We attribute additional cash requirements to development of phone software for Biologistex, the advancement of cloud solutions, and spend on marketing and sales. We give this event a probability of 30% because of the reduced cashburn noted previously.

**Valuation and summary** 

Obviously it is difficult to estimate the share price of such a company. But here is a yolo guesstimate.


**EPS EoY 2015**|-0.02~+0.01|
:--|:--|
**PPS EoY**|**$2.90~$3.20**|
**Rating**|**Strong YOLO**|

15-09-03,3ji3ka,A word of caution - things to keep in mind when transferring investments,"I opened an account with Betterment in 2011. I've been contributing to my ROTH IRA since then and have a decent amount saved up. Recently, I realized I was basically throwing away money by not simply buying the vanguard ETFS myself, since betterment charges fees ontop of the Vanguard fees. 

Over a month ago I filled out the paperwork to transfer my assets from Betterment to Vanguard (At this point in time I was up 800$). Weeks go by and I hear nothing from Vanguard. Finally they tell me they've received my paperwork and forwarded the request to Betterment. Weeks continue to go by and then the stock market takes a plunge and I go from +800 to -350. Not a big deal, I have a very long way to go before retirement and would simply hold until the market improves. I then get an e-mail the day after the crash saying that Betterment would be unable to transfer my investments in kind and would need to liquidate them and transfer it. I go onto my account and see that all my assets were sold with a realized loss of -100. 

So for the past week I've missed out on all of the gains and am in limbo waiting for the cash to arrive in my Vanguard account to be reinvested. I never even considered this as a possibility when I started the transfer. I was under the impression It would only take a week or two and my assets would be kept in kind since almost all of them were Vanguard ETFS. Lesson learned though and thankfully I didn't have hundreds of thousands of dollars on the line during the move. ",15

Key term is **grow over a long time** here people because I already borrowed $625,000 from a bank and construction already started last Tuesday (I don't like to wait because time is money). The first year of construction is being financed by half of that 625 grand and the other 19 years (it's a really big dock) is being financed by taking the first half and doubling it again year over year via my genius investments in gold and oil...

15-09-03,3jjs0o,ELI5: CAD Hedging and when (if ever) I should consider buying CAD hedged funds.,"Backstory:
I'm in Canada.
I want to buy some S&amp;P 500 ETFs and have been wanting to for a while. It would be medium term (5-10 yrs but maybe longer) investment I let cook in my Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA).

The recent little blip got my attention and I want to buy while the markets are down.

I researched and I saw my TSX choices are VSP (hedged) or VFV (unhedged).

Right now, my Canadian dollars are trading with USD at $0.75 of mine for $1 of yours.

My understanding of hedged ETFs is that they remove the volatility of the Canadian dollar, but I don't fully understand how that works.
If you compare VSP and VFV, VSP (hedged) is a lot flatter over the last year while VFV is pretty damn close to the S&amp;P 500.

My little brain wants to think the flatter VSP is the result of the two graphs, S&amp;P500 and the CAD vs USD, being added. Is this even remotely correct?

So let's run some scenarios:

1. One day the CAD will be back at parity.
If I buy the non-hedged and sell when the CAD is on par, I'll have sweet S&amp;P gainz with crummy strong CAD losses.
Would it then follow that the better option would be the hedged ETF?

2. The CAD sinks some more. Hedged ETFs are not my friend.

3. The CAD remains more or less the same. In this case, the hedged ETF shouldn't matter?

Because of the timeframe, maybe I don't care about where the CAD will be? It's almost always somewhere between 65 cents and $1.10. I guess what I'm wondering is how I should strategize buying US ETFs with a weak CAD. 


PS I've already read the couchpotato articles (http://canadiancouchpotato.com/2014/03/06/why-currency-hedging-doesnt-work-in-canada/) but they seem to be mostly based on a strong CAD.

I'm helping my Dad with his finances and bills after my Mom passed away. Dad has some money with Ameriprise and I want to make sure it's properly allocated. I know there are general rules for stock/bond allocations based on your age. (The FAQ in the sidebar for a 75 year old person would say that around 55% of his money should be in bonds.) However my Dad's health isn't the best so I'm wondering how that factors in here. At what point to do you want to go super-conservative, and even move money into accounts that can't lose money if the market drops. As a younger investor myself I just assume for myself that the market will eventually earn back any losses I have if I'm in it for the long term. But for my Dad we don't know if he has 2 years or 10 or more years left. Is there some general idea of what to do do with someone's money when their health is iffy and you're not sure what time they'd have to recover if a sustained recession hit the market?

15-09-04,3jmhcs,Is Netflix (NASDAQ: $NFLX) in Trouble?,"Jim Cramer said back in July Netflix is worth $100 billion. When the company first signed the multi-year deal with Epix, that sent the stock soaring, but it just lost what's arguably the biggest major motion picture powerhouse in the world. Yes, the company has produced some better original content, but people have already checked out of House of Cards and OITNB and the viewership data just isn't there. 

With the stock now below $100, does this mean Netflix is a buy? Or is the market right to be doubting the company's generous earnings multiple when it has tons of competition on its heels bidding for content?

A stock opinion piece on some of those points here:

15-09-04,3jmvau,Ratio Spreads - Nifty for building positions in high volatility environment if willing to hold LONG,"Warning: It can be boring as fuck to watch these work, but In this high volatility environment, sometimes you get lucky.  You need margins, options, and a set on you to do this, but it could come in handy.

XOP - O&amp;G because I like playing with falling knives
2x 
* Long 9/4 - 37 Puts : Cost = $261
* Short 9/4 - 35.5 Puts (x2) :  Cost = -266

Current value:  Short leg = $20, Long leg = $144.  Paid $5 to make $144

Placing these against a core position - If we get a 3% pop, I'll sell shares, put a replacement in and wait - most of the time I can get in for small $ - and rolling up is not an issue, the hardest part is patience, and if shit starts to plummet you're going to buy the shares so it's not for the feint of heart.   If you wanna YOLO it even harder, you can pair it with call spreads on the way up (making basically a ""super-guts"" type strategy)...  I'm just hoping O&amp;G stabilizes so I can use it to build LT positions - but in the meantime it's much more useful than just selling a put - at least here if it dumps, you can get put premium + spread between long and 1 short - to buy at a deeper discount.

Also, a second bonus question just in case: My longer objective is to use this to set up a google spreadsheet with a ticker to auto-import the tables. I've tried this with morningstar.com.au, but I'm reasonably new and don't know what I'm doing wrong. It works on guru but not on morningstar.

and it doesn't work. Source says there are 8 tables on the page and none of 1-8 work.

The only thing I can think of is that on morningstar I have to login to my account to actually see the financial history and when google spreadsheets looks it up it might be met with that wall.

Interesting, liquidity has been a concern for some time, that in 2007 the fed was more concerned about liquidity than a long drawn crash, they pulled the ""uptick rule"" out.

I know if I try to play the market I'll lose, so I want to either buy a fund that tracks an index or a mutual fund. I have two questions on that front. I can invest like 3-7k, and I plan to buy a car in the next year or so so I'll probably pull a lot of it out then.

1) Which should I do?

2) If a mutual fund, how do I pick one?

Edit, important information:

goals: Don't leave money on the table by having an 8k bank account make less than $1 a year in interest

risk tolerance: medium, I need to still have enough to buy a car, but I'm not saving for retirement or anything important.

time frame: months before I pull some out, &lt;5 years before I'll switch to something more retirement focused.",2

However, instead of having all the dividends reinvested in the stocks that generated them, I would like to redirect all dividends algorithmically to the highest dividend return stock (as a percentage return on the money invested in that stock, with, perhaps a historical bias characterizing dividend return volatility).  

Anyone know of a platform that would allow me to do this?

I think that perhaps much of the profits are lost to short term taxes as these things reset their leverage everyday and of course I know that there are fees associated with whatever derivatives or what have you that comprise the fund, but I was hoping that someone could provide a more detailed but also somewhat ELI5 explanation of how much this would eat into the 800%.  I was also wondering if anything similar exists that does not reset daily, something that does a better job of minimizing the drawbacks associated with leveraged funds.  In short, despite a limited conceptual understanding of these funds, I realize I would like to know more.  One specific question I have is: what happens if the underlying has a 0.0% day?

15-09-05,3jp9wv,"""Let’s talk about Risk, Roboadvisors"": An article from iheartwallstreet.com that says Robo portfolios are too aggressive, and don't warn their inexperienced young customers enough about the risk associated with it.","http://iheartwallstreet.com/2015/08/24/lets-talk-about-risk-roboadvisors/

According to the author's experiment: 

&gt; Wealthfront is taking almost as much risk as the market itself (i.e. being invested 100% stocks in the S&amp;P 500) and yet sadly, giving their investors approximately 1/2 of the return of the S&amp;P 500.

I repeatedly see young investors on this subreddit going for very aggressive portfolios, and thought this article may be of interest. Especially this part:

&gt; Now before you get all worked up, let me say this too: I know diversification is smart, I believe in it. I also know the US has been one of the best houses in the neighborhood called earth these last few years so this isn’t necessarily a “fair” comparison. But I’m also a professional investor with all of this investing knowledge and factoids &amp; context, because it’s carved deep into my abdullah oblongata.

&gt; I know &amp; have seen firsthand the risk associated with being in a 90/10, or 80/20, or 70/30, or a 60/40 portfolio when things go wrong. Sometimes very wrong.

&gt; In contrast, most of Wealthfront’s and Betterment’s investors are new. They do not have these benefits or insights, nor do they have any muscle memory or context. Basically, they’ve watched a video about fire and now think they’re ready to grab a hose and swing from the back of the firetruck.

&gt; Meanwhile, advisers like me (whom are apparently all evil and dumb and completely unnecessary if you ask a roboadvisor) have gone into and dealt with hundreds of burning houses over the years, sometimes completely naked just because we know we can now. We know how hot the fire can get.

&gt; And here’s the kicker: these new investors, they’re paying attention now, because everyone pays attention on 500 point days. They’re looking at their Watch &amp; Apps; staring. And these firms gave them the power to do it. In the face of all of that, here’s Wealthfront’s YTD performance (rebalancing daily, because that’s a feature too)""

First, I love how their company is institutionally structured for the benefit of their members. Second, their low fees are remarkable. Third, I'm a big believer in the core of an investor's funds being held long term index funds.

My portfolio is something like:

* 10% VG Intermediate Term Gov Bonds

* 10% VG Intermediate Term Corp Bonds

* 10% VG Intermediate Term Tax-Exempt Bonds

* 10% VG US Large Cap

* 10% VG US Mid Cap

* 10% VG US Small Cap

* 10% VG US REITs

* 10% VG International Developed Large Cap

* 10% VG International Developed Small Cap

* 10% VG Emerging Markets

I've always stacked VG Emerging Markets (VWO) against iShares Emerging Markets (EEM) as a way to show I was getting a comparable performance for 1/4th the expense ratio (0.15% vs 0.68%).

However, I just discovered the dividend of iShares is around 4X the dividend of Vanguard **(0.87% vs 3.33%)**. See this: http://www.dividend.com/dividend-stocks/uncategorized/other/vwo-vanguard-emerging-markets-etf/

vs. this: http://www.dividend.com/dividend-stocks/uncategorized/other/eem-ishares-msci-emerging-markets-index-fund/

**Basically, should I stick with VWO?** A +2.5% dividend is an incredible incentive.

*Edit:* And now I see @ http://stockcharts.com/ that EEM has a .83% dividend while VWO has 1.0%. Now I'm really confused.",23

15-09-05,3jsa44,Why you might care about risk parity strategies,"http://www.sl-advisors.com/why-you-might-care-about-risk-parity/

&gt;... JPMorgan’s Marko Kolanovic published a recent research note in which he sought to quantify the volume of selling that such strategies might execute in different market scenarios. By calculating the amount of RP and momentum-based capital and adding informed judgments on how it reacts, he came up with numbers, and he concluded that selling in the hundreds of billion of dollars is possible. Moreover, because such portfolio adjustments take place over many different time periods, the type of dislocation that we saw on, say, Monday August 24th will, in his opinion, be repeated.

&gt;Much of this risk on/risk off activity measures risk as volatility, which is not the best measure for most investors unless you use leverage. **Investing with borrowed money means you not only care about whether an investment travels from 10 to 20, but also the path it takes on its way there. Stopping at 5 first represents merely an inconvenient detour for the cash investor but a potentially capital-destroying one for the leveraged one as a margin call forces untimely liquidation.** Cash investors who worry excessively about the market are emotionally leveraged if not economically so; their best move is to reduce their positions to the point at which they are more concerned with their golf swing. For a cash investor, the risk of a permanent loss is the risk they care about. If you own companies with strong balance sheets and earnings power, the path prices follow needn’t concern you. Just focus on the health of your companies’ businesses.


I would only add that you should also focus on the price at which you first purchase your companies' stocks, as that will the one of the biggest determinants of your returns.",4

Are you going to play the next FOMC meeting? What are your opinions on what will happen and how will you plan to profit from it? 

I was discussing this with another Redditor about this, and I basically explained why I don't believe they will raise Rates at all in 2015. Personally I will build a gold + gold miner etf position prior to the meeting, which I will sell after the spike.

If youre interested here's briefly what i had said: 
*My personal opinion is that they will not raise rates in 2015. The coming meeting will likely be Yellen speaking with rhetoric and yet again that they are data dependant and still lack enough economic strength or whatever reason. I Look at US economic data &amp; compare them to other time periods. The US economy is not doing signifcantly better than around 2009 and taking that into account there is not much chance of a rate hike. Infact the very purpose of a rate hike is to subdue an economy thats growing too fast, for the reasons like high inflation (from demand pull). The US is certainly not growing at such a rate that it requires a rate hike. Back in the 08 crisis, Bernanke stated himself that the purpose of QE was to inflate the markets to create a wealth effect and therefore increasing aggregate demand. So our current 'bull market' in US stocks is ***strongly** facilitated by cheap credit and injected liquidity. I believe any rate hike will be similar to a popping of a bubble and create a bear market for equities. 
You can say 'the US economy has survived rate hikes in the past, whats to say that it wont survive one now?'. Well yes, just like in 2005 when the Fed started raising rates from 1.5% to 5.5%, equities just kept going higher. But Do you really think the effect will be the same? You must compare the surrounding fundamentals when comparing. Increasing interest rates from 1.5% is **much** more different to raising rates from practically zero %. 
Consider this;. has the US economy ever had a precedent for zero % rates? No. This is a historical first. We've had zero % for around 7 years now. That is also the longest time without a rate hike in US HISTORY. Not raising rates is the safer option as it's not economically viable to raise rates nor is it Politically viable - It is uncharted territory and I dont believe the Fed will want to be held responsible for a market downturn.

15-09-06,3jw1zc,My Favorite Company: AMAVF,"The following is a story of my first good trade with a possible opportunity. 

The first really good trade (investment?) I made was into a little Swedish company called Arcam Ab in mid-late 2012.  In mid-2012 there was an explosion in interest and stock price of the 3D printing companies. The well known companies 3D Systems (DDD) and Stratasys (SSYS) were flying upward, and I began trying to find an undervalued company involved in some way in 3D printing. Autodesk worked on related software, and it was also on a tear, but not quite what I was looking for. A few articles came out saying this or that was related to 3D printing, saw huge price spikes, and then crashed after others pointed out they had nothing to do with 3D printing. I happened to read a mention of this company that made very expensive printers that 'printed' in titanium alloys for aerospace and medical implants (hip replacements and the like). Without much excitement I began looking for any news I could find on them, eventually accepting a seekingalpha article was the best English analysis I could find. The article itself viewed AMAVF in a very positive light. It had (IIRC) a p/e of about 20, no debt, was working with NASA and major aerospace companies, and was growing quicker than the major companies with p/e's triple or more AMAVF's (and with debt).

I thought it seemed a bit too good to be true. OTC trading can be more dangerous, and fraudulent, subject to pump and dumps, etc. The commenters seemed to all agree. Things such as ""I'm not touching this with a ten foot pole"", ""Congrats up day today good job"", etc. Saying the author was manipulating the price or the company was fraudulent. However looking at the SEC's track record with catching fraud compared to Sweden's, it seemed to me to be as safe or safer than a U.S. company on a major exchange. I finally found something others hadn't yet, by doing the tiniest amount of research. If any of you have read No One Would Listen (about the ignored warnings given to the SEC about Madoff), that shaped my opinion of them at the time. 

I put a few thousand in and it immediately ran, within three months going from $5 to over $10 (split adjusted, at the time it was ~$20 to ~$40). Thinking waiting for an even bigger gain would be greedy I sold most of it off in a few trades. I proceeded to watch it go up to $50 split adjusted and a p/e of about 250, kicking myself the entire time as the meager remains of my position skyrocketed in value. 

3D printing reached peak hype when Obama mentioned it as a new industrial revolution at a state of the union address. Since then DDD and SSYS have collapsed and AMAVF has followed suit. It has gone from $50 to $13 a share and a p/e of ~250 to ~30. However the underlying story is still good: strong growth, virtually no debt, opening a factory that should allow them to deliver 70 systems a year (previously they had a large backlog every quarter), opening a new office in the US, etc. It may *finally* be time to start buying new shares again. I think buying some shares of this company (three years later) and buying some VXX puts are going to be my only big moves the rest of this year (for me, I know some of you have way bigger portfolios...)

15-09-06,3juxb2,"How I plan on turning $10,000 into $20,000 by Thursday.","I'm posting this to help solidify my thought process as we go into next week. If anyone finds benefit from reading this, then I'm glad to have posted it. There are three steps on my journey. The first of which starts on Tuesday morning:

-------

#Step 1:  Buying AAPL calls early Tuesday morning, selling them at the bell on Wednesday morning.

Target Entry: None. Purchasing them a bit after the opening bell.

Target Profit: 30%

I'll be looking to buy $10,000 worth of October 16 115 Calls. I'm not exactly sure how I'll be timing my entry, but if China shits the bed on Monday/Tuesday, then I'll wait until the dust settles before I buy. I personally think major volatility is finished for the Chinese market, but either way, it shouldn't affect my play after I purchase the calls. AAPL should go up once the market settles on Tuesday.

Why AAPL Calls? : The event on Wednesday morning that starts at 1 PM EST. AAPL usually has a nice price appreciation going into the event, and even with the choppy market, I expect the same for the stock.

Why are you buying October calls? You're paying for theta that you aren't going to use.

Yeah, I am. For a few reasons. Namely that I'm at best, a novice options trader. I don't dabble in them very much, and holding too much volatility doesn't sit well with me. Buying a distant expiration date protects me from fast price jumps both up and down.

If you're worried about volatility, then why don't you just buy verticals or something?

I suppose I should. But, doing it this way is just easier for me to understand and manage.

Expected Outcome: If AAPL appreciates in price by at least 3%, then I'll walk away with around a 30% gain on my calls. Which will bring me up to $13,000.

-----

#Step 2: Roll $13,000 into GNSZ on Wednesday morning.

Target Entry: .90 cents

Target Profit: 22%

GNSZ is a Jbem777 pick, and it's the stock that all of his followers are currently focused on. It's a microcap biotech company that is going to present at a conference on Wednesday at 10:50 EST. They were originally going to present sometime in November, but their data was so compelling that they chose to present it early. It's a very attractive catalyst.

As a result of Jbem's buy-in, the price has already jumped from .70 to .85 cents. However, I think his followers are going to be cautious  and not let the price appreciate too high before the conference, after many of them got burned by buying too high during his SGNZ play that never took off. I can see the stock going up by another 5 to 10 cents between now and the the conference, however. I hope to buy in at .90 upon selling the AAPL calls. The company has a low float and a ton of Jbem devotees with an itchy trigger finger, waiting for the green light from this company to buy. After the company presents, I can easily see this breaking $1.00 and into at the very least, the $1.10 range, where I'm hoping to sell.

Expected Outcome: I'm looking to buy in with an average of .90 and sell at 1.10. I doubt it will go that smoothly, but assuming it does, I'm going to walk away with a 22% profit on my $13,000, which brings my total to a little under $16,000.

------

#Step 3: Roll $16,000 into TPIV - the bane of my existence, and hopefully the reason for my salvation.

Target Entry: 40 cents

Target Profit: 25%

I love this company. I expect big things for it in the future. However, I hate this fucking stock. It has imploded from a high of $1.80, to a current low of .33 fucking cents, while waiting for a Phase 2 announcement, which I thought would have happened a long time ago. It's hard to envision seeing $1.80 ever again. But, I have a good feeling that with patience, good things will come this company's way.

And, as it turns out, the company is presenting at the exact same conference as GNSZ, and while it doesn't have nearly the kind of hype that GNSZ has, it still remains as a low float stock with tremendous upside potential.

I have my long position in this stock set in stone, that I will be holding until I feel that it gains the kind of market cap that it deserves (read: never.)

But, if they announce FDA approval for Phase II at this conference, then the stock is going to go on a ride upward, which makes it an attractive short-term play.

I plan to hold GNSZ until the very last possible moment before buying TPIV. Their presentation starts at 3:00 PM. I'm not worried about a huge price appreciation until we hear news. And even if there is a Phase II announcement, I don't expect the market to fully digest the news until Thursday. This is a Pink stock after all, with no Jbem hype anymore.

Still, I can see a very quick move from .40 to .50 which is where I will be selling this short-term play, even though I think this stock will run much farther upward.

With a 25% gain, that will bring my total to $20,000.

-----

**Why am I doing it this way instead of just yolo'ing AAPL weeklys or something?**

Keeping my stress levels low. I think all three of these are very safe bets. The most risky is definitely the calls, but I really can't see the AAPL stock trading flat in a run-up to the conference. Even if it does, I can just pull the money out and start the next phase of the plan.

Hopefully, it all works out!

Edit: Formatting.

- don't like fees

15-09-07,3jy3gw,Any non American/Singaporean/Hong kong investors here who invest in Vanguard? How did you start?

As a know nothing investor I intend to auto invest 50 to 70% of my income and live very frugally for 15- 20 years. 

That said Im confused about how to establish a vanguard account where I am (Korea). Contacting the Hong Kong branch I was told that index funds are unauthorized ""for retail clients"" (What does this mean?) in Hong kong and Korea. 

I was offered the alternative of a Exchange traded fund (ETF). I read up a bit and it seems similar to Index funds. Comparing with the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 index fund what are the nuance differences a neophyte like me should be aware of? Also what are the first steps to investing with a brokerage firm outside of ones country?

Here is the email exchange:

Thank you very much for your email and interested to Vanguard. 

So far, both South Korea and Hong Kong do not have direct account opening service for retail clients. Also, index funds are unauthorized for retail clients in South Korea and Hong Kong as well. 

Alternatively, if you would like to subscribe our Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) listed in Hong Kong/ US/UK, any brokerage account which allows you to deal with securities listed in Hong Kong/ US/UK is fine. Please kindly contact your stock broker, banker/ private banker in Hong Kong or investment advisor for detailed trading, account set up and fee charging information. Our advice is compare the price with different brokers, and choose the one with the lower commission fee. 

The minium trading amount is 100 units for your reference. 

At this moment , Vanguard Hong Kong has five SFC-authorized ETFs listed at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. 

Vanguard Hong Kong just launched the fifth ETF- S&amp;P 500 ETF in Hong Kong on May 21st, 2015.

I'm 19 and I think it's time for me to start looking into the stock market and online share trading. I don't know much about it so I figured taking it slow and asking some questions around here might be the best option.

I've been putting money into a high interest savings account since I started my first job, and I'm thinking of buying shares with $100-$200 of it. I have enough to not really be worried if I lose my investment. It's really just for me to get a feel of how online trading works. So, I created a trading account with my bank. I haven't really looked too much into the details but it basically just allows me to buy and sell online, with a fee of $14.95 AUD for amounts less than $10,000. This is basically all I've done at the moment, other than researching some terminology and stuff like that.

Do you have any general advice for me? Is opening a trading account with my bank a smart idea or should I have gone with a proper broker? Is it worth investing $100-$200, even just to get a feel of how all this stuff works? 

I considered calling the people at my bank for some advice, but I don't think that would be much help except to help me with using the website and stuff like that.

Also another question I have: Since I'm Australian, if I wanted to buy US shares, do I need to consider changes in the exchange rate when I want to buy/sell? Is there any general advice you can give me for this?

Any other comments/criticisms would be appreciated.

Thank you!

It has lured many an investor in on expectations of huge profits only to dash their dreams as the stock floundered in the period of turning FDA approvals into sustainable revenue.   The good news for new investors is that there is now very limited down-side risk and enormous potential upsides.

**The Company**:

BGMD makes a diagnostic test for heart disease that is approved for use with those already diagnosed with the disease to predict the path of the progression.   In march the company filed for a 2nd indication that would allow the test to be used to diagnose new cases of heart disease.   Approval of 2nd indication is the difference between millions of tests and a few hundred thousand.  Historically, [the FDA approves nearly 95% of applications that have made it through clinical trials](http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2015/08/25/nine-explanations-for-why-the-fda-is-approving-almost-every-new-drug-application/), so the odds favor an approval though it is certainly not guaranteed.   A decision on FDA approval is expected before the end of the year. (""*It’s still in process and we continue to expect and hope for clearance by the end of the year.*"" -- [August ER transcript](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3452206-bg-medicines-bgmd-ceo-paul-sohmer-on-q2-2015-results-earnings-call-transcript) ).

-
The company had a partner for its tests earlier this year, HDL, however that partner is currently in bankruptcy.   This impacted revenues from the first half of the year, however the partner has resumed purchase and accelerated payments -- not reflected in the current ER.  Because of HDL's financial condition, it likely was inadequately marketing BGMD's test.   

-
As of August, BG Medicine's tests are now being sold and marketed through Abbot Labs, this revenue stream JUST kicked up and is not reflected in any previous earnings.  3rd quarter revenue should show much improved sales of the test and by the 4th quarter we should see the full value of this partnership.

-
The company's stock is a wreck at the present time.   In July the company was nearing the end of its last two 180 day NASDAQ de-listing extensions.   To maintain compliance the company did a 4:1 reverse stock split, and at the same time paid off a loan that was a drag on earnings per share.  This was initially somewhat popular but the stock slumped from the $3 range to the $1.50.

-
The second part of compliance was shareholder equity.   To meet this, the company did a warrant offering for 4 million shares @ $1.00.   The warrants prevented immediate dilution and provided the cash necessary to meet NASDAQ compliance.   This was NOT popular with shareholders and the stock slumped from $1.50 to .90 which way over-reacted to the possible future dilution.

-
While NASDAQ is quick to act on share-price warnings, equity apparently takes a little time and though the theory is that BGMD met both share price compliance for the required time AND equity compliance through the warrant offering, there is still the possibility the stock will move to the OTC markets, but there is also the possibility that BGMD will be taken off the non-compliance list.

-
The stock is currently trading in the lower .60s.   It has a float of only 11million shares (15 million if you include the recent warrant offering) The company has no debts and has an estimated $4m cash thanks to the recent equity offering.  With cash on hand of $4m and new revenue from Abbot unaccounted for, the company currently has a valuation of only 6.7 million (2.7 million if you subtract cash on hand).  Given 2million is just one quarter of potential revenue from abbot, this valuation is ridiculously low.

-
Even discounting revenues, the .40c level can be considered the virtual floor since those levels will have the company trading below cash on hand.

-
**Catalysts**:

* September NASDAQ compliance decision due in the next few weeks.   **This could be negative**, although every indication is that the RS and Warrant offering met the letter of the law as required by NASDAQ.  The present valuation is also trading as if delisting has already happened.   Re-listing and a few weeks off the non-compliance list should easily see this company trading over $1.00.  So there's a potential -20c downside to a +.40-.50c (or more) upside on this catalyst alone.

* 3rd &amp; 4th quarter earnings should show improving revenue from their 2 partners.  With the revenue really hitting its stride in the 4th quarter.  The next two ERs should show just how ridiculously undervalued this stock is given their new revenue streams.

* FDA 2nd indication approval.   This is the real catalyst.  This news, going into the the tiny float should EASILY see share prices above $5 and possibly spike over $10 for a while.   This would truly be an AQXP style run as the news floats and the demand for the stock shoots up but not enough share-holders willing to sell.  

**Risks**:

* NASDAQ could decide to de-list.  They have that ability even if BGMD technically met the requirements.   If so its possible to see this trade in the .40 range until its other catalysts are met.   Anything in the .40 range would be at or below cash on hand so the risk here is mitigated.

* FDA could decide not to approve the test for 2nd indication which means BGMD would be limited to selling its tests to existing diagnosed patients to predict the path of the disease.  While not a disaster, earnings on the existing test should place it in the $2-$3 range by the end of their fiscal year.

* ""Company going private"".  This is a popular theory by those shorting the stock.   The theory is that if the stock drops low enough the company will just buy up all outstanding shares and go private on the cheap.   I mention this here because it is something you're going to read if you do your own DD on the stock (and you should).   However given the extraordinary pain caused by attempting to keep NASDAQ compliance, I don't believe this is the company's intention.  And a warrant offering certainly doesn't make sense if the company was planning to go private.   In this scenario, the company would ignore NASDAQ, go OTC and buy out there.

* **LOW VOLUME STOCK**!   This stock trades less than 200,000 shares a day.   Good news will spike volume enough to exit graceful on your targets but if anything goes wrong, be aware you will have difficulty extracting yourself from the stock if you purchase significant amounts of stock (which is easy to do with this float and valuation).   Exercise limit buys and sells, do not set market order stops or you may reach into the pennies to sell your order.

* Manipulation!  This stock is currently under heavy manipulation because of its low volume and float.   Expect the social media boards to be depressing and there's even talks of lawsuits.  The shorts will be swept away like so much dust on the FDA announce and I seriously doubt they can contain a 3rd quarter ER let alone a 4th.   I'm not sure what their game or target is, but it is easy to see each small buy re-shorted back down, and each larger buy stepped back down.  So do expect negative price movement until the catalysts hit.   If I could I'd tell you the exact moment you should buy in but NASDAQ and FDA are all unknowns, all I can say is that a buy in now should look like pure genius in 6 months.  Just be aware that it could touch .40 before it touches $1 or $2.

**My Estimated Targets**:

* NASDAQ approval: Over $1.00 share.  (For a similar scenario [research ELTK](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?uhb=uh3_finance_vert_gs_ctrl1&amp;fr=&amp;type=2button&amp;s=eltk) which was taken off the NASDAQ non-compliance list on August 26).  While they went up ~.30, I believe that because BGMD is so heavily shorted we'll see an additional .10-.20 boost in covering.

* 3rd quarter ER ($1-$2 share over the NASDAQ bump if any).  Excludes FDA.

* 4th quarter ER ($2-$3 share over the NASDAQ bump if any). Excludes FDA.

* FDA 2nd indication approval ($5-$10 over any other metrics, spiked with return to $3-5 over any other metrics).  Assumes there's a period after FDA to exit before 2million warrant dilution occurs.

The driving idea behind my portfolio is to get a decent return by investing in a way that generates investment capital and reduces my correlation to the market. Added to that is the natural instinct to stick to what I know best and can understand. I probably have overlap in my ETF's and have been slowly working that out. When big shifts happen, I move out of one and into the preferred one. For example, I recently closed out of a North American utilities ETF and will move that cash into one of my existing holdings near the end of the year. For my individual holdins, I don't plan to sell any of them, ever. However, if it gets to a point where I think the valuations are stretched, I will sell a piece and take profits. There is a separate piece of my portfolio (~5%) devoted to shorter term holdings that get sold within 2 years of purchase. Currently that list includes, Imperial Metals (III.TO) and Bombardier Preferred Shares (Series B and C)

EDIT: To be clear, there is another portfolio that I have been managing since 1999 that is not included in these numbers. ",5

15-09-07,3k0olk,"Semi-passive ""Buying the Dip"" - my analysis says it returns 25% more than passive investing. What am I missing?","I ran a quick analysis on the past 5 years of NASDAQ returns. [Here's the analysis file.](http://www.filedropper.com/buythedipanalysis)

* Each time the NASDAQ closes down more than 1%, I assume I make a buy the very next morning at the NASDAQ's opening price.
* This strategy was compared to a control group where you make the same total buys, but buy an equal amount every day regardless of what the market did the previous day.
* The net result was that the ""Buy the Dip"" strategy ended with a return of **48%** (since Jan 2010) compared to **38%** for the control group.

Are there flaws in this analysis?

Right now I have an auto-investment through Betterment/Wealthfront occurring every 2 weeks. This analysis would suggest that I should cancel this auto-investment and invest it only on days when the market closed down &gt;1% the previous day.

Thoughts? Seems too simple, I must be missing something.

15-09-07,3k0oup,AXPW: final countdown,"Not going to run through a giant history, as it's all over this sub and frankly, not needed at this point. Here's what you need to know if you're new or just forgot what week it is:  

- AXPW makes some serious lead-carbon batteries. Rumors a while ago of a Tesla deal but never anything more than random pumpers these days.  

- low float stock that saw vol as high as 10mil and as low as &lt; 3mil last week.  

- the 13th is the deadline (extended from June) for their deal with a company in China, for $250,000 up front and $10 million over time.  Batteries shipped to China end of August for final testing.  

- last deal update was announced on a Saturday, so the fact that the 13th is a Sunday doesn't mean they wont remain quiet all this week.  

Outlook: this stock saw the near famous spike recently  to almost $4 with no news.  If the deal is approved, I expect minimum $5 right away. If the deal has failed, expect a drop like you've never seen before. Twice last week it triggered the short sale circuit break rule. Low volume has slowly ran it back down just under $2. Each morning has started with a spike and slow trickle downward. The list isn't updated as of this writing but they should have triggered for Tuesday as well. Shorts will not be heavy anyways, and if so they will likely close each day this week before market close because AH good news is too risky for them.  

Possible outcomes:  

1.  Positive news, deal approved: stock soars and we get paid.  

2. Bad news, no deal:  Armageddon.  

3. Mediocre news:  stock tanks but not end of the world.  

This is a gamble, pure and simple. Sub $2.00 is a fucking steal if the deal is approved and announced this week.  The float is low enough that with full volume it will start jumping 20-30 cents a tick. Both directions. Full disclosure: I am a bag holder but have averaged down heavily this past week and the possible home run have kept me from selling for a loss last week on small morning spikes. ",4

As a frugal college student, I'm wondering if it would be smart to sell 1 or both of my GOOG stocks and reinvest that money somewhere else with more growth potential. Or, instead, just hold onto the cash and then reinvest in GOOG later if/when the price gets under $550. I bought those GOOG stocks at $622 per share, and I initially intended it to be a long-term investment.

Have spent a lot of time reading the FAQ and basic online resources.

I'm 25 years old, and looking to invest my current savings into a long-term portfolio. Have a good paying job and plan to invest more from my paycheck (keep buying during a crash, rebalance each quarter, etc). I'm okay with high volatility and losses year-to-year, this isn't money I need to live off of. I'm considering this to be my retirement fund for 2060 or so.

Given this, I think it makes sense to have a fairly high-risk portfolio, while well diversified. Do you think that 50% VOO (S&amp;P 500), 20% VXUS (international stocks), 20% VB (U.S. small cap), and 10% BND (US bonds) makes sense? All are very low expense ETFs and seem to give a good mix of diversity, with overall high risk/return (and slight tilt to small cap).

Would really appreciate any advice!

Cheers.

UPDATE: Thanks again for all the input everyone. I didn't know about the extended market index (VXF)! I'm going to go 50% in VOO, 20% in VXF, 20% VXUS, and 10% bonds. Basically, 50% large cap US, 20% small-mid cap US, 20% international, and 10% bonds. Seems like a good relatively high-risk/return mix with no overlap among the component pieces.",32

When viewing it as a table by month, what I extract is this: the mean values are not useful as they tend to be biased by spikes, but median values show that consistently since 1990, and with no variation except in the past five years, the median value of the S&amp;P500 has been 20, not 15.  

Since 2010 however, the median value has been about 17, only recently passing 20, then falling below it in the past month.

It will also go on to tell you about high-net-worth investors and the history of wealth management. It began in 1933, focusing on high dollar clients, and then it details history through the 1980s and today, ending with a top 10 list of the companies that provide the best private banking services overall. None of which is helpful for you if you are looking for help with investment management and portfolio analysis.

What Wiki Doesn’t Know

Wealth Management Is For Everyone. Yes, that’s right – everyone. Your wealth may not compare to the wealth held by “high net worth investors” by Wiki’s definition but it is your money and your future. You can, and should, start to manage it now, even a low amount. Managing your funds gives it the chance to grow and who knows? You might be one of those high-dollar investors one day too.

Risk Is Part Of It. You can read though what wealth management Wiki says about the industry a hundred times, but there is nothing there to tell you how to handle the risk that goes with investing. No entry is going to make you feel more comfortable about high risk decisions, guarantee a return or tell you not to do it. You have to decide for yourself what you want to do, based on your gut, available funds, and the advice of your financial advisor.

What Will Happen Next. If you look over the broad history of investing over the last one hundred and fifty years, you will see what looks like history repeating itself. Every period of high returns is followed by some sort of “crash” – a time when stocks dropped, the market plummeted, and for a short time it looked as if the sky is falling. And then the system rights itself, and all is well again. Smart investors making informed choices, balancing risk and opportunity, stand to make money and position themselves to weather the next crash. For all its wealth management knowledge, Wiki cannot tell you when that it is going to happen and how to get through it.

Wealth Management Is Science and Faith. At the end of the day, no one has a crystal ball. Wealth management Wiki gives information in a steady staccato of facts and data, leaving emotion and intuition out of step-by-step clinical write-ups about every topic under the sun. While you may read an article that gives you Step 1, Step 2 and Step 3 to investing your wealth management portfolio, those general instructions mean nothing without your mind, heart and instinct providing input on the decision as well.

Financial advisors spend years learning about investing, reading up on companies, stock options and trends in the market. When looking for information on wealth management, they are your best resource. If you prefer to get information online, wealth management on Wikipedia is not the place to go, even if it comes up number one on Google. There are numerous advisors with websites that offer live opportunities to consult with them. Get the science of investment management and portfolio analysis from those who know it best and will tell you or help you figure out what wealth management Wiki will not.

In reality, All Day Breakfast is a very limited subset of the company's full breakfast menu. There's no McGriddle, nor is there anything involving bacon (which seems odd, because bacon appears on the lunch/dinner menu). The Big Breakfast is also missing a number of other items.

I myself am an accountant by trade, I am 25 years old. Currently living with no debt, and I do not need much money to sustain my lifestyle. I've got my TFSA maxed so putting it in their is out of the question.

I've got two options from where I see it, 

1. Invest the money in the market. 
I have been getting pounded the past 8 months, so It could be a good time to use my money to snatch up some good deals and hold. 

Option 2. 
Purchase one or two Investment properties, and build on them in the long run. 


I do my own investing, and I worked for a extremely successful landlord for a while so I am somewhat experienced in both.

I like the idea of having different income streams, and real estate prices in the city I live in has stayed consistent.

Backtesting allocations 40 years gave me these portfolios with high Sharpe &amp; Sortino ratios with low expense ratios:","So this all started when I started a discussion on r/investing about how small- and mid-caps seem to outperform total stock market in the long term. Backtesting allocations has shown me interesting results, including the fact that $10,000 invested in 1971 would be worth $4.5 million today if invested 100% in Emerging Markets (versus $700,000 today if invested 100% in Total Stock Market). 

&amp;nbsp;

This led to days of experimenting and comparing successful/standard mutual fund performance versus my experimental ones. I tried to manufacture portfolios with higher CAGR (compounding growth) with less Std Dev (volatility). Each additional percent in CAGR led to hundreds of thousands extra in final value over 40 years.

&amp;nbsp;

I want to remind everyone that past results do not guarantee future returns. HOWEVER, we use the past extensively to predict investing. This is why investors tend to use value stocks, why investors believe allocation determines risk and return, and why people stay away from penny stocks! Past performance! So why not use it to our advantage?

15-09-08,3k4lb9,Options simulator in Excel,"Hey guys,

I'm a senior studying business and have been fascinated by options trading and valuation for a while. I wanted to get a better understanding of how the option value evolves in relation to the underlying asset and the greeks. I built an options simulator in Excel that has been very useful to me so far, and thought I would share it with you guys to get some more feedback on what works and what doesn't. 

You can find the simulator [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/s3en6n2ker0zp3a/Options%20simulator.xlsm?dl=0) and a write-up about some of the functionality [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/options-simulator-excel-j-e-sebastian-rollen). Disclosure: the second link is to my LinkedIn page, let me know if I'm breaking any subreddit rules by posting it.

The simulator should definitely work on Windows 8 and 10, will almost definitely not work on Macs (sorry!) and I'm not sure if it will work for previous editions of windows, so if you run into any problems, please let me know!

EDIT: I've been told that the model currently only works for excel 2010 and 2013. I will try to update it and post a version that works for 2007 and earlier as soon as I have access to a machine with that version",8

So far, things have gone.... so-so. Right now, I'm still on step 1, which was:

Buying AAPL calls early Tuesday morning, selling them at the bell on Wednesday morning.

I bought 30 Oct 16 calls at 3.86, worth $11,600, giving myself a $1,600 bonus to start with. For the purposes of staying true to this challenge, I'll have to make $23,200 to succeed.

Anyhow, I know now that I could have bought in at a way better price after watching price action throughout the day. AAPL dipped all the way to the 110's level. However, at close, I'm at +$106, which isn't much, but it's green. From tomorrow's expected pop + vega, I'm still hoping for $3,000 from these calls, and then it's off to GNSZ, which is trading at an expected .90 cents.

What I **didn't** predict was TPIV to launch quite so soon. It's up 30% today, which is fantastic for my long position. I still maintain that it'll receive a significant pop upon the presentation, and with a 30 percent pop, it'll start alerting to short-term investors for tomorrow. But it's making me wonder which will receive the bigger pop starting from opening tomorrow - GNSZ or TPIV.

I am a bit tempted to take my AAPL profits, call off the plan, and split them between TPIV and GNSZ to see which runs the most starting from 9:30. But, I think my original call still is the best one. I'm excited for tomorrow.

15-09-09,3k8qiz,College Fund Investing.,"Hey All. I'm a student at a 4-year college who's currently on track to graduate with around 40K in debt. I'm looking to invest my college fund in something that will wipe out as much of this as possible. The fund is a bit more than 20k at this point. I'd like to be able to pull around 10K a year out of it as that is how much my loans are, although I know returns like this are somewhat unrealistic. I'm curious if you guys have any recommendations of stocks to put it in or what to look for in a company's financials for short term investment. I say short term because it needs to be spent within the next two years. 
Thanks, 
Colin

UPDATE: after doing some research, I'm thinking about ETF's. Anyone think this is a solid plan or have any recommendations for me? Thanks. ",4

I'm looking at WTI currently at $45ish however any conversation online I hear are on Futures/Options/some other derivative and no one seems to investing in the commodity itself. Is there a reason for this?

Also, when I check w/ my broker, the cost of carry is huge (~11%??). I can understand forex with interest rate differentials but why Oil? Is it the cost of storing the actual barrels? 

This cost alone would kick my ass over 1-5 yrs. In case I've answered my own question, what other benefits or drawbacks are there for investing in oil via futures.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3f6r31/mcz_to_the_moon/

Since then, it's up 30%.  Pre-orders for Rock Band 4 are sold out @ bestbuy.com.  And the Amazon ranking for the Band in a Box bundle is holding strong in the top 30.  

This is going to be a big win for Madcatz.  There is still plenty of time to hop on before the train leaves the station.  They are a small company with a product that is most likely going to be a success, and will have a big impact on their bottom line.  

Take a look at the share price from a few years ago when the Rock Band games were in full swing if you want an idea of the potential here.  I'm not saying it will hit 2.00 / share.  But as MCZ is now the publisher of the game, they will be making significantly more on this product than they had in the past.  

The rest of the products they make are pretty subpar.  But really don't mean much compared to the potential of RB4.  

Anyhow, to those of you that hopped on board last time, congrats.  And to anyone thinking about hopping on now, good luck.

I know most people include a mix of different funds. But, here are my reasons why I want to focus on just the total stock market fund: 

1. Vanguard has a $3K minimum to invest in each fund and my current budget is about $3.5K per year. 

2. I recently started my career and finally am eligible for a 401K. I put all my 401K into a Target Retirement 2055 fund. So, at least part of my portfolio is balanced. 

3. I have 40+ years until retirement. I can later add a bond fund and international fund if I want.

4. I don’t know what I can do about bond fund losing value when the Fed raises the interest rate. 


But, I’d like to seek an advice before jumping in. Is there something else I should consider? 

I'm 24, and can put in $300 a month.

15-09-10,3kbvsz,Professional advice needed regarding Mobileye (MBLY),"Long story short: My broker account opened about a week and a half ago, and I was eager to buy some stocks right away. The two stocks I bought were PSEC and MBLY. PSEC is doing fine but MBLY is down 15% since I bought it.


Anyway, my reasoning behind buying MBLY was that I thought it was similar to TSLA in many ways. I knew that it was overvalued (as is TSLA), but I thought that this was a stock that could skyrocket once self-driving cars become the norm. Literally almost every ""research"" article I read about it online said that this stock has huge upside and recommends to buy it. So I thought, ""eh, why not?"" 


Today however, a research firm called Citron shred MBLY to pieces in this article: http://www.citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MBLY-final-Sept-9.pdf


Today alone, MBLY fell 8%+ after this article was released. It mentioned that ""self-driving hype"" was the only thing keeping the stock afloat. I understand now that this is 100% true. However, ""hype"" is also what is currently keeping TSLA afloat. Anyway, this article goes on to show that MBLY BARELY spends any money at all on its research, doesn't own any unique patents, and that its founders/original investors before IPO have been dumping the stock at a ridiculously alarming rate. It finishes off by saying that MBLY will end up just like DDD after the 3D printing hype ended. 


Are there any experienced investors here that can read that Citron article and tell me whether or not Citron is ""fear-mongering"" or if it's telling the truth and that all those articles I read about MBLY earlier are bullshit? I need help determining if the charts in the Citron article are as alarming as they make it seem. Earlier articles I read said that MBLY could go up 100%+ in a year, and that it has no competition and is the ""clear leader in the self-driving car revolution"". This article by Citron seems more logical to me however, although I need some help telling me what these numbers mean for the stock.


Here are some of the numerical highlights from the article in case you don't want to read the whole thing: http://imgur.com/a/YiuxI


Should I continue holding on to this stock? Or should I dump it tomorrow immediately and accept my 15% loss before it turns into a 50%+ loss? ",2

I am 19 years old and want to enter the market however I am still unsure about where to put my money.
I have been studying etfs ( index funds like s&amp;p 500)and it does seems like they are my best alternative. 
I have close to 8k and wont need this money for the next 5 years or more, therefore I am looking at the long term.
The one thing that i would like to clear up is just how can I make money with etfs on the long term, considering the lack of dividends.
From what I understand  the approach would be buy right now and basically pray that the price of the etf will go up and then I sell, the simple buy and hold strategy. The one thing that isnt quite clicking is how people do it on the long term( 40 years). Do they buy and just yolo pray that 40 years from now the price of the etf is up? And one last questions, can etfs really double in price in periods like 5 years? Otherwise they would perform just like some kinds of bonds, which are far safer.

Anyway thanks for the help and feel free to ask any questions.

Good Afternoon-
 
Here are my trading thoughts for the week and a review of recent trades. Please excuse the lack of trading updates over the last few weeks. The market was tanking and I was focused on stock research.  I do not currently hold a position in any stocks at this time. I am completing my due diligence on another company and hope to have that out within the next week.
 
Market volatility continues and I believe that this will last into next week when the Fed meets to discuss interest rates. Here is a link to a recent article that I believe summarizes the causes behind the recent market volatility.
 
http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/08/29/opinion/show-some-spine-federal-reserve.html?smid=fb-nytopinion&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=2&amp;referrer=
 
TRVN- This turned out to be a spectacular trade due to the release of positive data. I believed the data would be positive, but like many, I was caught off guard by the early release. Information gleaned from the study will help guide P3 trial designs and based on current study results.  I believe there will be a significant chance the P3 data will be positive. Also, keep in mind the company is expecting P2B TRV027 Topline Data in Q2 2016. This program has been partnered with Allergan and may receive $65 million cash payment if successful.
 
After the release of positive data, I chose to sell 50% of my position in after hours in order to lock in solid gains. Given the market had dropped 1000 points the following week; I did so to ensure solid returns. I then sold the remaining 50% of my position the following day when the stock peaked over $10. My total return for this trade was 38%.
 
GNSZ- GNSZ provided the opportunity for a short-term catalyst trade. As I have previously mentioned, my goal for short-term catalyst trades is 10-20%. I sold a small portion of my position prior to data and sold my remaining shares after reading the data release. Given the data release change and expectations set forth by the CEO, I was willing to risk holding through the news. This was clearly a poor decision on my end.  When a company announces that they intend to release “data,” I expect figures, not anecdotal evidence. The PR contained nothing but anecdotal evidence to suggest efficacy. There were no patient numbers, survival figures, or anything else to reinforce their position that the drug was effective. The partnership information was lackluster as well and this further reinforces my belief that life science CEO’s tend to over promise and under deliver. The market realized this and it became a “sell the news” event. I sold my remaining shares in the $.79-$.90 range for roughly a 12% gain. For those that chose to take profits prior to the data release, I applaud you. There was ample opportunity for many to take 10-20% gains prior to the release, and in this situation, that was an excellent decision.
 
Holding through catalysts is risky. As we can see with these two companies, it can either be a fantastic decision or create the opportunity for sustaining loses. It comes down to risk tolerance, individual investing philosophy, and personal goals. You must determine your own goals, strategies and risk tolerance when investing in these stocks and not be persuaded by what others are doing.  I have continually stated that you should each set your own targets and not to be afraid to take profits based upon your own goals. I intentionally do not indicate when I sell some or all of my position because I want each of you to determine your own goals and to not be dependent on me.  That’s what will make you better investors and guarantee continued returns throughout your investing career.
 
I complete my due diligence and share it with others so that they may read it and make a reasoned investing decision. Many people lack the time, knowledge, or ability to complete the necessary research to make these decisions and I hope that in sharing this information, I am able to give the average retail investor the opportunity for making a profit.
 
Good trading to you all,",8
15-09-10,3kgkh4,18yo - starter investment portfolio,"[Super simple starter portfolio](http://hellomoney.co/portfolio/50e330) has 2 holdings: 2 stock funds. It has a 98/0/2% allocation in stocks/bonds/other.

15-09-10,3kgplg,Using Parameter Optimization to Backtest over 5000 Strategies for Lay Investors Facing Market Downturns [X-Post Algotrading],"Suppose that you have a modest investment in the market -- maybe you hold SPY -- and you read the newspaper to get the prices once a day. And then suppose that the market starts turning the way it did in August, and you get scared. What do you do? The folks at 538 wrote a piece that says you should not sell, and instead simply hold on to your assets. 

I wanted to test whether they told the truth. I used algorithmic trading techniques to find whether there's a simple strategy that a lay investor can use to beat the market in such a scenario. 

I used parameter optimization on some 5000 backtests, testing slightly different strategies that a lay investor might use (i.e. sell after some drawdown, buy back after some rebound) to avoid big downturns like the ones in 2008.

My parameter-optimized results indicated that while some backtested strategies substantially beat the market, these strategies are dangerously overfit to a very small sample (despite testing over a 13-year window, we've really only had two major market downturns in that window). Since the next major economic downturn is likely to be quite different from the last two, any one of these parameter-optimized strategies is not safe to use going into the future. 

I conclude (somewhat unsurprisingly) that there's no simple, lay investor strategy that ensures market-beating returns in times of economic downturn. 

You might be interested in [reading my research project](https://www.quantopian.com/posts/market-panic-parameter-optimized-strategy-for-lay-investors), in which I go through the steps of parameter optimization, develop a fine-looking result, poke holes in it, and ultimately reject it.",10

15-09-10,3kfo9f,"PSA - how pump &amp; dumps really work","Just a little story to give some of you an idea how stocks are pumped. Seven years ago on vacation in Cayman I met a guy whose job was to be a penny stock pumper. I was staying with his family so I got to talk to him a lot about it, and he gave me a lot of background info.

Basically he would specialize in a specific industry - in his case, gold and rare-earth mining (always in a volatile industry where ""discoveries"" are important, another common one was biotech). He would have small companies as clients, who would pay him in options only, as employee compensation, and he was somehow obligated to hold them a certain amount of time. This was synched up to a schedule of when the company owners were selling their stock, so that he could pump it before they sold. This way they weren't just pumping it up to a certain point then selling all at once, and did all their pumping under pseudonyms. They never had it in writing that he synched it with their selling, it was just assumed. He lived in Cayman b/c he was Canadian and didn't have to pay cap. gains on his income there, he made like 250K/yr for a while and was saving a ton of it (I saw his bank statements). He saved over a million bucks, but then lost almost half of it in the 2008 crash.

He was pretty good at what he did - think about it, if someone came on here with enough industry and company specific knowledge and was ""helping"" you by giving you his analysis, a lot of people would have no way of detecting his affiliation with the company. Same thing for other sites - you make posts on Seeking Alpha, run your own blog, cross-post on a half-dozen other forums, and suddenly you look like an analyst rather than a pumper. Your own actions pump and drop a stock price so you look like a prescient analyst. You tell people to get out right after you and the CEO do so you get more people to follow you and support your next pump.

Is there something I am not missing or it is as simple as making a personal call on rather to take a 4.3% rfr or an average of, say 8%, in large stocks with ""x"" market volatility and a rfr of less than 1%. 

If the interest rate was much higher I'd lean more towards that for sure, but 4.3% seems easy to beat and right now I'm leaning towards maybe paying to cover the interest(x2) for a year or two just to really work on getting some money into the fund.

TLDLR:

-Annual revenues of around 120m, adjusted EBITDA around 2-3k
-Turnaround story: thesis based on probable operational turnaround to profitability
-Traffic has declined since IPO; revenues have declined as well despite having made a number of acquisitions, whilst there hasn't been profitable for the last 3 years

-Founder returned 12 months ago as CEO; announced turnaround strategy which was to monetize noncore assets to shore up the balance sheet and focus on the core business, return it to profitability

-Stock has run up a certain extent since then due to sales of noncore segments, but operational turnaround has not been priced in

-Gross margins up from 35%-38% to 41%; marketing expenses as % of sales have gone down from 30% to 19%

-Customer experience has improved drastically and revenues have stabilized since founder's return

-Current EV is around 30m, which is just 0.25x sales. With slight improvement in sales, impact on the bottom line will be significant.

-40m cash on balance sheet, no debt, means downside is relatively limited (current market cap is around 70m).

-CEO owns 11% of company; collectively insiders own 25%

-Insiders have continued to purchase shares in the last couple of months

15-09-11,3kkee4,Advice on Inverse ETFs and Canadian stocks to watch for.,"Hey guys,

So I'm new to investing, and been mainly focusing on Canadian equities. My portfolio currently consists of:

Bombardier (TSX: BBD.B): 34%

H&amp;R REIT (TSX: HR.UN): 5.2%

Suncor Energy (TSX: SU): 17.3%

Toronto Dominion Bank (TSX: TD): 16.8%

Cash: 26.8%

Overall Return: 11.47% mostly from Bombardier's recent performance. 

I was reading up on the recent outlook on Oil and looking into inverse ETFs (leveraged and regular). Given that Goldman cut its price forecast on oil to $20, but also the IEA reporting that oil supply outside the OPEC would be falling, what would be the advice on investing into a leveraged oil ETF? Namely I'm looking at **(TSX: HOD)**. 

Also, what are some good bargain **Canadian stocks** to watch for? I'm looking to build up some diversification so maybe invest in biotechnology, pharma, technology or mining but open to anything. 

Would appreciate any advice and welcome any criticism. 

Thanks. ",14

I [posted earlier in the week](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3k4lb9/options_simulator_in_excel/) about the option simulator I built and got some great feedback from you about it. [I've also written an article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/intro-options-part-1-basics-j-e-sebastian-rollen) that is the first in a series teaching options and options strategies from the ground up. I know that there are a ton of great resources out there for options, but I hope that my guide will be useful for visual learners and people who want to be able to play around with the concepts in real time since they will be able to use the simulator I built. 

I started by just explaining what an option is and am aiming to moving towards some more in-depth topics such as Greeks, strategies for different situations (volatility, bull/bear outlook, etc.) and hopefully covering more advanced topics such as delta-gamma hedging in the near future.

If you already know a lot about option trading, the guide may be too simple for you, but I always appreciate feedback about what things I could explain better or expand upon. ",10

15-09-11,3kkjct,Wynn Resorts (WYNN),"In the midst of the bad news from Macau, I've started looking at Wynn and LVS. At what price would Wynn be good value?

My basic idea is that gambling is not going to disappear. The desire of people to gamble is very high. For example in stocks, day trading comes very close to gambling. People like to gamble. If there’s a football game, especially if it’s boring, you’ll enjoy it more if you bet a few bucks. The human propensity to gamble is huge.

Wynn is led by Steve Wynn, who is a proven owner-operator and has best track record out of all the casino owners. He's been in the gaming industry for 30 years. He has vision - he sees what other people do not see. And Wynn the company is the best run gaming company in the world, with multiple drivers for growth in the medium term - recovery in Macau (timing looking uncertain), Boston (probably from 2018 onwards, depending on how long it takes to get approved + get the casino built), Japan (probably for the longer term / 2022 onwards). What sort of multiple would you pay for a company like this? 20x? 30x?

Wynn Macau's revenue attributed to Wynn was 3.8 bn for 2014, and Wynn's Vegas operations revenues for 2014 was 1.6bn. Wynn's overall profit margins was around 18% for 2014. If we value Wynn Macau at nothing (which is insane), and put a 20x multiple on earnings from their Vegas operations (around 295m), we would be valuing that at around 5.9bn. Company is trading for ~7bn right now. It traded at 7bn back in 2005 when it had $0 in revenues and all it had in assets was: (1) the new Wynn Las Vegas resort; (2) an annex to Wynn Las Vegas, the $1.4 billion Encore, on which ground will be broken this summer; (3) a $700 million casino scheduled to open in the Chinese territory of Macau in late 2006; (4) a recently submitted bid for a license to build a casino in Singapore.

Would love to hear your thoughts. Is a 20x multiple too high? Are there any real liquidity concerns? Thoughts on the gaming industry in general?

15-09-11,3kj0vj,How I have fun in stocks without a lot of money,"So I have fun trading and enjoy stocks but I can't afford to risk a ton of money so here is what I do.

I have around $1200 dollars in robin hood(who doesn't have margin accounts). Everyday I make 3 ""yolos"" as you call them for only $100 each which I sell the next day usually. This way I can make trades everyday without a margin account. Since I only trade 25% of my portfolio a day I should always have funds while waiting for previous trades to settle. I even got as lucky as a 50%+ return on a stock over night recently. (Unfortunately only on a 100$ investment).

I figure i can have fun and learn more about the market without risking a ton money at once.

Four Canadian Oil Picks for Defense

Credit Suisse
We have lowered cash-flow-per-share estimates for the Canadian oil and gas sector by about 10% for 2015, about 20% for 2016 and about 15% for 2017, based on our updated crude outlook and incorporating potential for further cost reduction.


Our lower cash-flow-per-share (CFPS) estimates position us about 5% below consensus for both 2015 and 2016, respectively. With lower sector cash flows, near and longer term, we have reduced targets by about 15%, with the greatest reductions among oilier, more-leveraged names.
In this challenging environment we remain defensive in our sector positioning. As such, we continue to favor companies with room to re-lever balance sheets in the near term while growth is preserved for the long term. Preferred names include Suncor Energy (ticker: SU), Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ), Cenovus Energy (CVE) and Arc Resources (AETUF). On a 12-month view, as oil prices are expected to rise into the about $60-per-barrel West Texas Intermediate (WTI) range by second-half 2016, we see about 20% total return upside for the group on average, based on our revised target prices and expected dividends.
Credit Suisse has updated its macro commodities view -- new forecasted oil prices remain low through mid next year, which should keep U.S. upstream activity contained (depressed) through 2016. Further out, through 2017, prices are kept below $65-per-barrel WTI, the level from which oil-production growth from America’s best shale basins would again accelerate.
Only in the 2018-2019 time frame are oil prices forecast to rise above $65 a barrel for WTI and $70 a barrel for Brent. Natural gas and natural-gas liquids (NGL) price forecasts are unchanged with the latest view.
A lack of clarity around Alberta fiscal and regulatory policy under the new New Democratic Party government continues to compound the uncertainty associated with the broader macro environment. While assurance has been provided that current royalty rates will remain in effect until year-end 2016, a review has been initiated with proposals expected by year-end 2015.


The Federal election in October could also influence a range of items from corporate taxation to greenhouse gas (GHG) policy, in addition to U.S./Canadian dollar exchange rates.
Against a lower-for-longer oil price outlook and uncertain Canadian political backdrop, there are greater risks for Canadian crude supply.",5

Looking at the launch of iOS 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9...investors have been burnt each time. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/2pf6G2d.png) are the figures:

* They do a summer preview, and on average investors **lose 1.6%** on the day. 
* They do a post-Labor day launch, and again there's a **lose of 1.3%** on the day.
* In contrast on the day they actually let you download the new iOS (typically, a week after the press hype), there's no move in the price. 

Though perhaps the more *remarkable* data is what happens between the Preview Day and the Download Day, with the stock **gaining 15%** over the 100 day period. That's the absolute gain. Relative to the S&amp;P500 it's still a healthy 12%.

So...with Apple, the hype on the event disappoints the market, but between the event the earnings power shines through on its own?

Or else the execution is lacking in these abstract retirement planning articles. They say 'start an IRA and max it out', but do not saying anything about how.

Per /r/investing FAQ suggestions, my situation is as follows ...

* I'm in my mid thirties, my wife is under 30. We life in San Jose CA.

* Dual income at $150K annually, total. We're comfortable.

* We own a home, the mortgage plus heloc eats about 20% of our take home pay.

* One car loan we owe $600/month on.

* Over $50K liquid in our checking/savings/money market accounts, earning well under 1% interest. Gross! - but I have no idea what else to do with it :(

* No additional loans, no CC debt, very disciplined at saving, credit score over 800. Elaborate spending, such as vacations or lavish furniture, is rare - every couple of years.

* would like to learn to put our non-emergency-fund money into some kind of - I guess it's called a security? - but 
I'm trying to nail down the IRA stuff first. Suggestions welcomed, in any case. 

* I'm a low risk kind of person, not much of a gambler. When I go to Tahoe, I go with the expectation to lose what I play. I have 30+ years to retirement, so a good long term trend would be more useful than trying to 'beat the market' (as I have read on this forum in the last couple of days).


I've been reading the hell out of this subreddit and been googling terms such as stocks, dividends, mutual funds, index funds, brokers, bonds, certificate of deposit, diversification, portfolios, risk vs rewards. When I started, I had no idea what any of those really meant. While my vocabulary is expanding, my brain is about to explode from confusion. This is an entirely different world!

To digress, I think I'm supposed to do something withe these IRA funds that have been transferred to Schwab, but I'm feeling so gun-shy about clicking around in there that I could use a little hand holding. I see the words ""portfolio"", and that seems useful. I see the word ""mutual fund"", and I've liked some of what I've read about it. I like the word ""blue chip"" and ""dividend"", because they sound like stable income. But I just don't know. I'm just babbling this stuff to give you a feel for my mind frame.

Any suggestions. Abstract stuff seems to abound, and at this point, I need something concrete. How do I get my IRA invested properly on Schwab.com? What do I click? What kind of money will it earn or lose? Where can I see trends to gauge this myself? Does it cost something to do this? Do I have to do this repeatedly, like once a year, or once a month?

I'm sure this is old hat. If another thread had tackled this, I apologize.",10
15-09-11,3klsub,Odds of NXPI - Freescale Acquisition Going Through?,"It would seem that the market is dramatically discounting the -- pardon the corporate-speak -- ""synergies"" that will result from NXP's acquisition of Freescale.

I've seen preliminary analyst 2017 EPS estimates between $9 and $13 for the combined company. Taking the conservative view, $9 EPS x a mere 15 multiple is $135/share by Jan 2018. That's a 50% increase in 2 years and 3 months. I'll take that all day, and if you buy LEAPS you could magnify those gains.

Even w/o the Freescale merger, NXPI trades at less than 14x forward earnings and has a PEG of 0.55...what am I missing or is this stock just simply oversold?

Only conceivable reasons that would actually make sense in my mind would be a rejection of Freescale merger or fear that NXP will get discontinued from Apple products...any answers?  ",1

15-09-12,3knpbf,Help Pick Globally Diversified Equity Funds,"**TLDR**: From list below, how many do I pick &amp; which?

---

Hi everyone

I'm thinking about buying an Equity Fund that is globally diversified so I don't have to keep up much with all the news. Ideally, a fund with lower risk that can somewhat benefit from stock market as I have big problem taking huge losses &amp; will likely sell every time.

Unfortunately, from where I live we only have access to these Global Allocation Master Funds (I cannot go out &amp; buy others):

* BlackRock Global Allocation Fund (50% US, 20% Europe, 20% Asia, Bonds)
* Lyxor MSCI World ETF (50% US, 20% Europe, 10% Asia)
* NN L Global High Dividend Fund (40% US, 40% Europe, 10% Asia)
* UOB United International Growth Fund (50% US, 20%, Europe, 20% Asia)
* Various other global allocation funds actively managed to compete with MSCI World Index Benchmark. There's no specific master funds information available on these products, so I guess they are doing whatever at their own discretion. This last type of funds' Sharpe Ratio range from 1.10 to -0.20, Information Ratio from -0.20 to -6.50, R2 from 85% to 55%, &amp; Management Fee range from 0.70% to 3.50%.

Given the limited opportunities &amp; information, I'm leaning towards BlackRock Global Allocation Fund, but I've had experience investing in a fund with good past statistics (Morningstar Rating, Sharpe Ratio, etc) that somehow tanked so bad it went into the Dogs List before (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/investing/funds/11770252/Popular-Aberdeen-Asia-funds-labelled-dogs.html). Then just few days ago this is on the news about BlackRock (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/10/business/dealbook/charles-s-hallac-co-president-of-blackrock-dies-at-50.html?_r=0). So I'm thinking maybe this time around I should diversify my investment among multiple funds with similar objectives? but how many? And should I still pick ones with good historical stats?

You guys [might not be familiar with these funds](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3kj0vp/are_we_allowed_to_ask_for_opinionscomments_about/), neither am I, but any help is appreciated. I'm relatively new to investing abroad &amp; barely know the credibility of any of these asset managers. As a matter of fact, I've never even heard of some of these asset managers before...

I'm happy that you guys have [hellomoney](http://hellomoney.co/) to simulate Portfolios. I've tried typing in these funds, but none of them come up, but BlackRock.

(With initial goal of diversification, I don't think investing in 3 specific regions through 3 or more different products will work well for me as I will end up micromanaging &amp; likely sell whichever one is losing a lot of money)

15-09-12,3ko8qa,Where The Stock Data At?,"For the past long while, I've been tinkering with Python scripts that gather free stock data from the web. I have end-of-day quotes, dividends, and splits for over 5000 tickers from yahoo going back to 1962. I have quotes and financials for over 14000 tickers from advfn going back to 1990. More quotes from stooq and netfonds, more dividends and financials from nasdaq, and I'm aware of a good dozen more sources that might be worth scraping that I haven't gotten to.

I still have some work to do to collate, correct, and merge all that data into a database, and I've barely scratched the surface on analysis and backtesting, but let's not worry about that just yet.

THE GAPS! Dear lord, the gaps in the data are enormous. According to csidata.com, there's been some 43,000 symbols that have been used on nyse, nasdaq, and amex since 1962. At best, I only have data for about 25% of 'em, and I don't even wanna think about the errors.

CSI offers quotes for delisted stocks, but the prices aren't listed on the web site. Considering their subscription fees, I'm guessing it's on the order of several hundred dollars.

But hell, people! The internet makes thousands of songs, movies, and TV shows available minutes after they're released, costing those industries millions upon millions (according to the industries, at least). How is it that this one single title, The Unabridged History of Stock Prices In Major U.S. Exchanges From 1962 to the Present, which has been around for over 50 years, is nowhere to be found? I've searched /r/opendirectories and /r/datasets, and all I've found is that I'm not alone in my search. I've search usenet and I've searched torrents. I've got nothing.

None of this is investment advice. Its just shit we've found in the depths of records/SEC forms/the net.


I first stumbled across Fortress Biotech when the company was operating as Coronado Biosciences. Coronado Biosciences was an -- odd company to say the least. It was a company seeking to use the [Hygiene Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene_hypothesis) in an attempt to cure Crohn's Disease and other autoimmune diseases via [Pig Worm Eggs](http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2013/1/28/1122334-1359357174442411-Iggy-Igette.png).

After the first trial failure, I took a position. A little after, I purchased and have sat on 4300 shares. Just to see ""where it goes"". Then, everything changed this year. Lindsay Allan Rosenwald took control of Coronado and paid the original CEO to step down.  In fact, Rosenwald completely discontinued all of Coronado's future pig worm egg trials.


At certain points, the company was up 100% or more from my initial position.  The biggest change however, was the company. The company changed from a biotech firm to something like [The retarded cousin of this big boy](http://www.valeant.com/).  A firm looking to acquire research, work on drugs, get approval on some basic drugs and support cash burn.

To some extent, the company seems to be in-line to do just that. The company's subsidiary, or rather shell entity Avenue Therapeutics owns rights to develop intravenous Tramadol,  [a drug with a hot market](http://i.imgur.com/mfK4ye1.png). Tramadol IV is currently in Phase 3. The company expects a decision from the FDA very soon. The company also owns a SPAC known as CB Pharma Acquisition Corporation. A shell company to acquire drugs and shit. The company has not provided significant additional guidance regarding Tramadol.

**Checkpoint Therapeutics**

In its most recent announcement, the company is planning to begin public book-keeping of its majority owned subsidiary [Checkpoint Therapeutics](http://www.checkpointtx.com/). [Things become very interesting when we take a look at form 10-12G. These forms give us an idea of what a company actually seeks to do.](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1651407/000161577415002489/s101780_10-12g.htm)


Some interesting excerpts:


&gt; Fortress and its affiliates, including all members of our Board of Directors, have been contractually exempt from their fiduciary duties to our Company relating to corporate opportunities. In consideration for the Services, we will pay Fortress an annual consulting fee of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) (the “Annual Consulting Fee”), payable in advance in equal quarterly installments on the first business day of each calendar quarter in each year, provided, however, that such Annual Consulting Fee shall be increased to one million dollars ($1,000,000) for each calendar year in which the Company has net assets in excess of one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) at the beginning of the calendar year.

This basically says that they either bet the company will go bankrupt or become a revenue generating monster (very far out, given its pipeline is all [pre-clinical](http://www.checkpointtx.com/pipeline/)).




**Avenue Therapeutics**

Avenue Therapeutics is going to be the main source of income for Fortress. http://dev.avenuetx.com/ It seeks to develop Tramadol-IV.

**Helocyte**

Not much is said about Helocyte, no employees on LinkedIn except for this kid https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=ADEAAAEOQeMB6s_OuM9_7k1bAnl88yI5a191M8U . The company is essentially a shell corporation for Fortress' collaboration with the City of Hope hospital. The Helocyte pipeline is: 

&gt;exclusive worldwide rights to two T-cell immunotherapeutic vaccines for controlling CMV in stem cell and solid organ transplant recipients. PepVax is an HLA-restricted vaccine for which we are currently enrolling a multi-center Phase II clinical study of CMV control in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. Triplex is a universal vaccine for which we expect to commence a multi-center Phase II clinical study of CMV control in allogeneic HSCT recipients in the second half of 2015. 

helocyte.com and helocytetx.com are pre-registered. we expect Fortress to drop news about the subsidiary very soon.

**Journey Medical Corporation**

Journey is yet another source of possible cash for Fortress. We believe that Journey's income will be realized in 2016 or Q4 2015. The company operates in a very high margin industry and just hired a sales force with fantastic background: https://www.linkedin.com/vsearch/p?f_CC=4787134&amp;trk=rr_connectedness

**Mustang Bio**

This is yet another collaboration with the City of Hope. Mustang Bio seeks cancer cures. The domain is pre-registered http://mustangbio.com/ stuff is still Ph1.

update: http://dev.mustangbio.com/


** The elephant in the room **

We believe that Fortress Biotech is a part of a larger play by Opus Point Partners to take down large cap pharma competition. To prove this we go back to **a Jim Cramer battleground stock, for which Cramer got an SEC subpeona for. Dendreon corporation.** 

See, Rosenwald is not a rosy person. Most of the companies he has been associated with have gone to zero. With the exception of [Cougar Biotech](http://www.fiercebiotech.com/tags/cougar-biotechnology) and Keryx. Cougar, at the time, was one of 3 companies competing with Dendreon in prostate cancer. However, it wasn't really a company as much as it was a shell company which purchased the rights to research and ""re-tooled"" the research. The other competitor was [Novacea](https://www.linkedin.com/company/novacea).

We have actually read the entire deep capture and [SEC document on Dendreon &amp; Cougar](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-4614.pdf).

In essence, we believe that Fortress is a vehicle and, through its subsidiaries is an attack on large cap pharma companies. We believe the following companies may do well along with Fortress Biotech (Pre-FDA companies):

* TG Therapeutics
* Medivation
* Regeneron
* Clovis Oncology
* Forward Pharma (headed by Joel Sendek, one of the guys helping to take down Dendreon)


Companies we believe may fall from grace (Revenue Generating group and Price competition with some binaries left):

* Intercept
* Puma (Pipeline: http://www.pumabiotechnology.com/images/pipeline.png)

Stagnation:

* Abbvie
* Gilead
* Amgen


We believe that Fortress' pipeline contains **significant overlap**. And, through the subsidiaries is aiming to compete directly with big-names, while playing a ""cooperative game"" with the smaller related companies to it. If we read the Dendreon story and follow Lindsay's track record, we can see that Lindsay is definitely using Fortress biotech for a pairs trade. The problem with the theory is that a lot of Lindsay's friends are now gone, especially S.A.C. Capital, Michael Milken, and the UBS analyst team set up by Joel Sendek and Lazard which attacked a lot of S.A.C. and Lindsay short book stocks.

The failure of Dendreon and the rescinding of FDA approval caused the death of 60,000+ people. Cougar Biotech's drug never worked. J&amp;J wrote off the 1B acquisition.


For me, the position is Fortress is still ""lets see where this goes"". But after doing this research, I do feel dirty. But hey, I'm a tiny part of all of this.  In the short term, I expect Fortress Biotech to have a 50% upside by eoy from Tramadol IV news. In 2016 I expect some appreciation to the stock price, with some revenue coming from Journey Medical Corporation.

We think investing in FBIO is extremely risky.

15-09-13,3kt2fg,Currency risk question,"Need some help understanding currency risk, maybe someone understands this better than I do:

I'm looking to set up a 100% stock portfolio, consisting of two ETFs (50% MSCI World and 50% EURO STOXX 50). Because I'm a European investor, the MSCI World exposes me to USD/EUR currency risk which is why I'm half in european stocks.

But how does a stronger Euro or Stronger Dollar affect the correlating stocks? Say the Euro becomes stronger, European companies will see less exports, and the European stocks will drop some in value. Alternatively, say the USD/EUR rises from 1.1 to 1.4, US companies will see rising exports and higher stock prices.

Does this effect ""inherently"" hedge against currency risk? Or is it too small and are other factors more important, thereby overshadowing this?",4

15-09-12,3komv3,Need advice on where to stick some money on behalf of my son.,"My 8 year old son is receiving dividends from my company through stock he has (gifted to him).  Presently he has about $25K in cash, sitting in a bank account that he does not yet know about, but my wife and I are custodians for.

I expect that over the next 10 years, he will get quite a bit more in dividends as well.

If it were my money, I would just invest it somewhere, which I have had considerable luck with (but I consider it luck - so don't want to risk his.).  

Since it is his money, I am unsure if there are laws or special things I might put it into.  For example college funds, or something that is a very steady earner of low risk that matures in say 15 or 20 years.

Is this possible?

She can access her bank account online, so that is not an issue. I have considered opening an account in a brokerage firm based in Russia and transferring the money that way, but is it really that simple? I have not been able to find much on this topic online, I hope you can help me out.

15-09-14,3kurrk,Advice for stock purchases - check on a quarterly basis,"I asked on the daily advice thread, however doesn't seem to be too much traffic or I am posting in the wrong area.

I'll be 30 next year and my wife and I make enough to not worry too much. We have a house and we are in debt 180K with 70K paid off. I am completely happy with volatility. We have no other debt (car or student loans). The money I invest will be 11K (two roths every year) and will never need to touch it. I do NOT want to vanguard or target fund this money as our maxed 401ks are doing this already. I will check these accounts maybe every 3 months? I'm specifically interested in dividend and long term for example maybe P&amp;G type stocks or RDS (although oil I feel will eventually phase out, but i'm an idiot in that sector). I'm also very interested in upcoming technologies including VR and robotics. Sorry for the text. Thank you for your time.
Also if you would like to comment on my other pitiful holdings. I'd be happy to listen. BMY (6 years now), PBR (3 years now feel free to give me shit will probably sell and write off this year) BCS (2 years now, dividend is fine) IT (less than a year, my friend works here and I missed regeneron)",1

15-09-14,3kusq4,Hey pf! Need some help with a tricky insurance issue..,"So a little over four months ago I cut the tip of my finger off working on a table saw at my job.  Without gory details basically I lost the tip of my finger and had to have some tendon rehab after an amputation revision surgery.  Healthcare being what it is I've managed to rack up probably around $25,000 in bills.

Thing is I own my place of employment.   I work for myself.

I'm covered by health insurance, I pay for workmans comp insurance and I also pay for general liability insurance for my business.

My health insurance is through my wife's employer.  They have refused coverage because it is a work related injury.

My workmans comp insurance won't cover my injuries because I am an owner.  According to my general liability insurance not covered because I'm a named insured.

Any chance someone out there in pf land can advise me on how to navigate this?  I find it ludicrous that I pay nearly $1,000 a month on insurance premiums when all policies are combined yet nobody wants to cover this now.

15-09-14,3kutld,ELI25: Short Selling,"Short selling is when stock is borrowed, sold, then bought back (hopefully at a lower price) and returned.  However, I have several questions about the details of this process.  I'm not sure if it matters but I am using IB as my broker.

(1) What is ""Current Rebate Rate"" and ""Current Fee Rate""? Is the fee rate the annual percent rate to borrow the stock?

(2) Who sets these fees? Does it vary by broker?

        For the next few questions, let's assume I am holding a long term short position.

(3) Can these rates change while I'm holding or are they fixed from when I open the position? If they change,

	(3a) What factors determine whether each of the rates change?

	(3b) Will I get a warning if there is a large change?

(4) How are the fees charged? Are they accrued then taken from your account once the position is closed? If the rates change, are fees accrued daily?

(5) Let's say the stock goes to the moon and the broker force liquidates long holdings.  Let's also assume that the account only has: $0 cash,  100 shares short of DDD, 100 shares long AMD, and 100 shares long INTC.  How will the broker go about deciding what to sell between AMD and INTC? Will they charge transaction fees for the forced sale?  Will they sell as much as needed to close the short position?",56

Uh oh... looks like they took on 179 million dollars of debt Q2. The last few quarters before that they were paying way more debt down than they just took, and it looks like Q2 of last year they also took on debt, not as much though.

What did they take debt on so heavily this passed Q2?

http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=61870&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=2072057

“For the quarter ended June 30, 2015, cash flow utilization from operations was $148.5 million, which reflected the earlier than expected receipt of certain customer payments during the fourth quarter fiscal year 2015 as well as the timing of spending on key development programs. “

… What are these key development programs? From what I see clicking around, they picked up Gulfstream G650 and G280 wing programs in Jan 2015. In case you don't know, Gulfstream makes sick ass private planes, here's a G650, don't we need these to fly to our helipad which takes us to our remotely located yacht??? https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Gulfstream_G650_departs_Bristol_23rdAug2014_arp.jpg/1280px-Gulfstream_G650_departs_Bristol_23rdAug2014_arp.jpg
 They also got an air bus contract this month to work on A320 and A330/340 planes.

I'm pretty certain I want to buy shares of this company as I think it's well valued, but I fear the shemitah.

15-09-14,3kxhw3,Apple Makes Wireless Carriers Take Notice,"Among the deluge of information from Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL) recent product announcements, it would be easy for investors to miss the implications of the company’s iPhone Upgrade Program. With new iPhones, a bigger iPad, reduced iCloud pricing, and more, it’s easy to ignore an offering that was barely mentioned. That being said, Apple might have just turned wireless carrier’s equipment plans on their ear.

10 Million Reasons to Think This is Important

If Apple’s iPhone Upgrade Program is going to be worth it to consumers, there is one big question that needs to be answered. Do iPhone owners want warranty coverage for their devices? A quick search on Google for “Apple iPhone repair” turns up well over 10 million results. Since the Upgrade Program includes AppleCare+, it’s a good bet that Apple believes customers want some type of protection for their investment.

T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS) is being aggressive, with a “special introductory pricing” of $20 per month for the iPhone 6S on its “Jump On Demand” program. However, after this “limited time offer” expires, the monthly price will go up to $27. At an expected retail price of $650 for the iPhone 6S 16 GB, roughly $27 a month would be the standard 24 month purchase contract. Apple is suggesting $32.41 per month for its Upgrade Program on the iPhone 6S, but is this competitive?

Screen Shot 2015-09-14 at 1.00.54 AM.png

Sprint seems to be the most aggressive after T-Mobile’s promotion. That being said, to get the same benefits of the Upgrade Program with AppleCare+, Apple actually beats 3 out of the four carriers on price.

The Carrier Perspective: Friend of Foe?

Since the iPhone was first introduced, carriers have alternately cheered and decried the device’s ability to attract customers. When carriers added more postpaid subscribers than they originally expected, the iPhone got the credit. However, when margins came in lower than expected, iPhone subsidies received the blame.

That being said, from AT&amp;T to T-Mobile, customers are choosing smartphones in overwhelming numbers. Since purchase or leasing contracts have become the norm, all four of these carriers generate significant revenue from equipment. Investors in each company need to ask, what if Apple takes some of this equipment revenue with the iPhone Upgrade Program?

Screen Shot 2015-09-14 at 12.56.31 AM.png

Apart from Sprint, each carrier witnessed significant equipment revenue growth. It also seems obvious that aside from T-Mobile, these carriers need their equipment revenue growth to offset a decline in service revenue.

It will likely take months, or even a few years, for Apple to make a dent in equipment revenue growth. Arguably, T-Mobile could stand to benefit the most, as the only carrier with positive service revenue growth. AT&amp;T and Verizon’s wireless divisions would seem to be at the biggest disadvantage, as equipment revenue is driving their overall wireless revenue growth.

Where Sprint is concerned, Apple’s iPhone Upgrade Program would help lessen the company’s capital needs to purchase the equipment. However, it would also make customers carrier agnostic, which could hurt the carrier with the weakest relative service revenue.

A New Line Item in Apple’s Earnings

While analysts are trying to figure out what the new iPad Pro, or the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, will mean for future earnings, the Upgrade Program could be an important factor in Apple’s future growth. Keep in mind, that between the four major carriers, they generated a combined $10 billion in equipment revenue last quarter. On a weighted average basis, this revenue grew at a 36% annual rate.

In Apple’s last quarter, the company produced over $31 billion in sales from the iPhone, and its second largest category was its Mac division with $6 billion in sales. Though no one is suggesting that Apple will take all $10 billion in equipment revenue from the four major carriers, this is almost certain to be a good business for the company.

Even if Apple only ended up with 10% of this equipment revenue, this would have added $1 billion to the company’s top line. At a 36% annual growth rate between the four carriers, this would have been the third fastest growing segment behind only the iPhone and “Other” (Apple Watch, Apple TV, etc.) segments.

Final Thoughts

While the new iPhones and the iPad Pro may get most of the press, Apple’s iPhone Upgrade Program could be a disruptive force in the wireless industry. Investors in AT&amp;T and Verizon need to watch equipment revenue growth closely, to see if Apple is stealing some of this business. T-Mobile investors should be excited, as the only carrier with positive service revenue growth. Sprint has the best combined upgrade price. However, investors should question if this will be sustainable, for a company burning cash and showing declining service revenue.

The good news for Apple investors is, the company just made it even easier to upgrade to a new iPhone each year. Since the iPhone makes up almost 60% of Apple’s revenue, making this annual upgrade as easy as possible, should keep this huge business moving forward. Unfortunately for the carriers, they may have a new reason to complain about the iPhone, and all of the equipment revenue they used to receive.",8

15-09-14,3kvf5c,What happens to common stock price during an IPO?,"I was offered common stock from my company in the form of RSU's. If the common stock price is hypothetically $3 by 409a valuation and the preferred stock price is $10, how would the prices typically change (converge) during an IPO? The reason I ask is that I've heard the common stock price converges with the preferred stock price. Does this mean the common stock usually increases towards the existing $10 preferred stock price, or the two stocks meet somewhere in the middle? The $3 and $10 values are hypothetical, but their ratios are realistic and typical, from what I've read.

15-09-14,3kxw5w,$BBY May Not Be the Best Buy,"Best Buy (NYSE:[BBY](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=bby&amp;fr=uh3_finance_web&amp;uhb=uhb2)) made some considerable progress in its [fiscal year 2015](http://investors.bestbuy.com/files/doc_financials/2015/annual/FY-2015-Annual-Report-on-Form-10K.pdf) as same-store sales turned positive for the first time in years. The momentum was carried into fiscal 2016 as the firm reported increases in revenue and earnings in its [second quarter](http://investors.bestbuy.com/investor-relations/news-and-events/financial-releases/news-details/2015/Best-Buy-Reports-Second-Quarter-Results/default.aspx). Performance was aided by online sales which experienced a double digit increase compared to the year-ago period. Best Buy also continues to generate substantial cash flows, and its management remains shareholder friendly. The firm boasts a ~2.8% dividend yield and we rate its dividend safety and growth potential as EXCELLENT, based on its [Dividend Cushion](http://www.valuentum.com/articles/20150506) ratio of 4.

However, Best Buy still faces the struggles of competing with the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:[AMZN](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=amzn&amp;fr=uh3_finance_web&amp;uhb=uhb2)) and Walmart (NYSE:[WMT](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=wmt&amp;fr=uh3_finance_web&amp;uhb=uhb2)). Best Buy has taken steps to narrow the price gap between its products and its competitors'; the firm now offers a price match service to compete, but this may not be enough. Traditional retailers continue to be pressured to focus on online sales as online consumer spending continues its upward trend. While Best Buy is improving its online sales, the firm faces the issue of online sales cannibalizing sales in its existing big box stores.

Best Buy is working closely with Apple (NASDAQ:[AAPL](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=aapl&amp;fr=uh3_finance_web&amp;uhb=uhb2)) to update its store-within-a-store format, adding more space and upgraded displays to present the Apple products. Best Buy has an exclusive relationship with Apple as it is the only retailer to have the store-within-a-store arrangement with the tech giant. This relationship should prove to be beneficial as demand for Apple-brand products remains high, and new products such as the Apple Watch and iterations of previous popular products continue to roll out periodically. Let's take a closer look at Best Buy's other investment considerations and derive a fair value estimate for shares.

**Investment Highlights**

• Best Buy is the global leader in consumer electronics as far as big box retailers go. We think the company must continue to reinvent itself to mitigate competitive pressures from the likes of online powerhouse Amazon. It was founded in 1966 and is headquartered in Minnesota.

• Unlike the now-defunct Circuit City, Best Buy is fighting back in a big way. Its e-commerce operations are performing well, and the firm is benefiting from product cycles in both large screen televisions and mobile phones. As long as the economy remains strong, positive comps are a real possibility.

• Best Buy will face a promotional environment in coming years like no other in its history. The costs associated with the firm's ability to retain holiday sales in recent years, for example, were significant, and the expenses to hold the line with market share may only intensify. Competition is unforgiving.

• In the past, founder and former CEO Richard Schulze has indicated a desire to take Best Buy private. Unlike other potential deals, this one has a key intangible that could help it get done--emotion. Still, the timing and details of any transaction remain to be seen, and Schulze likely isn't the only one looking.

• Best Buy holds a net cash position on the balance sheet, and bankruptcy risk is nil. The firm is generating gobs of free cash flow. Still, it's hard for us to get excited about any big box retailer.

**Economic Profit Analysis**

In our opinion, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Best Buy's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 36.9%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.8%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT.

**Cash Flow Analysis**

Firms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Best Buy's free cash flow margin has averaged about 2.1% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively MEDIUM.

The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Best Buy, cash flow from operations increased about 33% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 20% over the same time period.

In the first half of fiscal 2015, Best Buy reported $308 million in cash from operations and $293 million in capital expenditures, resulting in free cash flow of $15 million in the period. In recent years, the firm has generated the majority of its cash flows in the second half of its fiscal year.

**Valuation Analysis**

This is the most important portion of our analysis. Below we outline our valuation assumptions and derive a fair value estimate for shares.

Our discounted cash flow model indicates that Best Buy's shares are worth between $32-$58 each. Shares are currently trading at ~$38, in the bottom half of our fair value range. This indicates that we feel there is more upside potential than downside risk associated with shares at this time.

The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $45 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 12.8 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 6.5 times last year's EBITDA.

Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of -0.2% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of -7.1%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 4.1%, which is above Best Buy's trailing 3-year average.

Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of -2.3% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Best Buy, we use a 10.8% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.

**Margin of Safety Analysis**

Each fair value estimate we provide is flanked by a margin of safety, within which we feel the company is fairly valued. Our discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $45 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.

Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. We think the firm is attractive below $32 per share, but quite expensive above $58 per share. 

**Wrapping Things Up**

We like the recent performance we're seeing from Best Buy.

The firm is fighting back from years of sub-par results, but its ability to reinvent itself while actively maintaining expenses will be paramount moving forward. The increased competition from online retailers is only gaining strength, and though Best Buy has experienced positive e-commerce momentum, its existing big box store sales will continue to face significant pressure. Though we like the firm's free cash flow generation in fiscal 2015 and the safety of its solid dividend, it is difficult for us to get excited about any big box retailer in the current operating environment.

All things considered, we are not fond of Best Buy as an investment consideration. Its technical indicators and relative valuation need improving, and we would like to see shares trading at a more significant discount to our fair value estimate before considering a position in the company. Best Buy currently registers a 3 on the Valuentum Buying Index.

I realize that this is in no way sustainable long term but without any immediate and obvious catalyst (excluding a possible conference announcement) it seems to be working. But the last week it's been slowly climbing and is somewhat stuck in a window of 1.36-1.38 so I'm starting to question my previous entry point. Any thoughts about it staying at this level?

Granted, I'm well aware of some of the economical concerns (broader market sell off, a little high on the P/E, etc.). But I just don't see how this company doesn't maintain the momentum. UA's international sales make up about 10-11% of total revenue. UA is way underexposed to the international market in this respect, and they are doing a lot to increase international exposure.",7

15-09-14,3kygoh,Trade of the week SPY strangle 197/194. Open it on a wednesday before the interest rate news!,"Heres my play:
 Interest rates are expected to come out some time thursday and are either expected to have a pos or neg (raise or maintain rates). 

If the outcome is to raise, my guess is it will have a negative impact. This will likely bring the spy price down to the next IV range 193-194 area. 

If the outcome is to maintain, my guess it will have a positive impact. This will likely bring the spy price up to 197-198 area.   

So to play this: I am considering entering one of the following on Wednesday. 

strangle 197/194 or IC with 0.5 spread
strangle 198/193 or IC with 0.5 spread

If you have bigger balls and are more risk adverse, you can enter the strangle now, and try and collect some theta.

Currently, the net theta (deltas - theta) for the spread is about -0.08. So theoretically, you should be gaining around $8 per day on the strangle. 

not sure what the delta curves are, but we'll see what happens. ",1

15-09-14,3kyjdk,Oshkosh Jan 16 Calls,"Sup wsb,

I'm here today to pitch the possibility of a great options call for Oshkosh Corp (OSK). These are the guys that were just awarded a $6.7 billion contract by the US gov for their new military humvees. The stock price rose about $6 when this was announced, and has dropped ~$2 since.

A few days ago, [Lockheed Martin appealed the contract decision on the grounds that the US didn't fairly give their humvee a shot](http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/land/vehicles/2015/09/08/lockheed-martin-jltv-protest-army-oshkosh/71893762/). The military has 100 days to respond. In the past, the decision has not been overturned about 80% of the time. The decision will be announced some time on or before Dec 17th, 2015. If OSK does well, there's also the possibility of the contract increasing to $30 billion, with additional humvees needed.

The asking price for a $40 Jan 16 call right now is about $3.80. Some firms have the price target as high as $48 for the near future. I predict it will go to at least $45 after they are awarded the contract. So there you have it, an 80% chance of good news around Dec 17th should be enough to push them $4. This contract is also more than double their market cap of ~$3 billion.",1

“teach me how to yolo” guy and “i have $200 help me make yachts plz” dude, this one's for you.

equities (stocks) are inherently unpredictable and volatile. great companies with great earnings and forecasts can see their stock price tank because of totally illogical sentiment. shit companies with shit forecasts can soar. if you do this long enough, you will have many moments where you think to yourself “how… the fuck… did that happen”. now take that uncertainty and volatility you’re imagining and multiply it by 100 — that’s what it’s like betting on microcap stocks. if you think shady shit can happen behind the scenes at big companies, the potential for manipulation around microcap from within the company and in the market is exponentially higher.

there are some honest and well respected people around here who genuinely enjoy researching tiny biotech companies hoping to hit big jackpots. they will write up posts giving well reasoned evidence for why a given stock will soar to da moon. it will sound not just reasonable, but really fucking compelling. sometimes they will be really good picks backed by honest research but sometimes they won’t be. and in the worst cases, these people absolutely do not have your best interests at heart. but here’s the point i’m trying to make:

if you are here to truly yolo your money around, then by all means, hop on the micro bio bandwagon. i guarantee you’ll hit some 2-3x paydays, and I guarantee you’ll get fucked. in the end, the skills you’ll learn are: googling shit, trying to spot bullshit, probably lots of FDA rules and regs, and who the fuck knows what else.

but if you want to enrich yourself, develop some real skills and potentially turn a hobby into an income stream and a fulfilling intellectual activity, think bigger. 

aside from the obvious education you’ll get on economics, markets and options trading, it's an opportunity to learn about different countries, cultures, governments, politics, psychology — all these things will help you understand why the market moves the way it does. and once you have some outlets for good information and a solid understanding of some of the main drivers and inputs of the market, you may, once in a while, have some insight into why things are happening, and make some money in the process betting on yourself and the vast wealth of knowledge available to you (unlike the very limited knowledge available to you around microcaps). 

TLDR - you can keep yoloing on red and black with microcap where your endgame is basically the same as it is on day 1, or you can begin a lifelong education and financial investment in yourself by learning the fundamentals of equities, options, the markets, politics, and the world around you. the choice is yours. there's no better yolo than a huge fucking play that has solid, well researched fundamentals behind it.

ps - no offense to the people who like microcap plays. they are fun and I’m sure there will be a bunch of you “omg I’ve made 100 yachts on $TPIV”. that’s great. but noobs need to understand what the fuck they are getting into.

[U.S. ticker BABA], claiming that the stock ""could"" go down by 50%.  Every stock listed on the U.S. exchanges ""could"" go down by 50%--no one can predict the future price of any stock--but of all listed stocks, BABA is one of the most unlikely to go down by ""50%,"" or at all; if anything, based on analysts' reports and reports, and on BABA's strong financial fundamentals and extraordinary growth, BABA is likely to surge in price within the next six months.
  Forbes' assertion is totally at odds with the analysts.  Fidelity Investments list 20 analysts covering the stock; of those, nine rate it a ""buy,"" eight rate it an ""outperform,"" and three rate it as ""neutral.""  NONE of them give BABA any negative rating, such as underperform or sell.
In response to the Forbes' article, no analyst has downgraded the stock; to the contrary, at least two today reaffirmed their ""buy"" recommendations, essentially saying that the Forbes' article is garbage.
 Forbes' baseless claim also is contrary to all financial data regarding BABA.  The company's recent Q2 earnings release was extremely strong, showing EPS growth quarter over quarter of 137% and Revenue growth quarter over quarter of 28.45% [see either Fidelity Investments or Yahoo Finance ""Key Statistics"" on the stock].  The Q2 revenue and net income figures also were substantially up sequentially, i.e. compared to Q1 2015.
  Fidelity Investments, based on the analysts' reports, states the the consensus EPS Growth for BABA for next year compared to this year is 27.2 %, and that it's long-term [3-5 year] projected EPS growth is 24.35% per year.
  BABA's profit margin for the last year is 52.95%, and it increased substantially in the most recent quarter, Q2.
  BABA has a market cap of over $162 billion; its revenues just last quarter were $3.265 Billion.  It has a modest PE of less than 24, and a forward price earnings of 18.6.  BABA's very moderate debt is decreasing: its long-term debt to equity for the last year was 34%, but in its most recent quarter dropped to 27.6%; and its debt to capital ratio is 21.9%.
Other key statistics:
Return on Sales, TTM: 52.95%
Return on Sales, MRQ annualized:  152.35%
Return on Equity, TTM:  34.75%
Return on Equity, MRQ:  67.45%

 BABA's extraordinarily strong fundamentals and growth show that the 20 analysts covering it are right and Forbes is dead wrong.
 The Forbes' attack scared some naive investors [its obvious intention], but not most investors.  The stock today was down only 4%.  That presents an excellent opportunity to buy in at an artificially deflated price.

15-09-15,3kze3e,Get net earnings from a stock given start and end date programatically,"Without knowing much about stocks, I recently told a relative that I could write a rudimentary program that could calculate the earnings for a set of stocks, given a start and end date, and see if that stock group outperforms the market or sector. I'm very familiar with Python and R and competent with most other languages, and I assumed there must be some good libraries/APIs for stock markets. I initially thought it wouldn't be too difficult to do this, however after reading more about the different possible fates of a given stock I'm realizing this is slightly more difficult than I'd originally thought.


I'm particularly worried about accounting for 'corporate actions' that affect dividends (both cash and stock dividends), as well as stock splits (and reverse splits) and mergers/acquisitions. If stock symbols themselves can change, I'd also like to account for that.


First, is anyone aware of a library with a function that does exactly what I'm looking for, given some set of assumptions? I haven't been able to find one, but it doesn't seem crazy to think that somebody has put together a tool that calculates this exact thing, taking into account the issues I'm worried about. If there isn't such a function, does anyone have any advice for good libraries or a general workflow for tackling this problem?


I'm leaving this a bit open-ended as I'm looking for both specific and non-specific advice. Everything's appreciated! Thanks!",2

15-09-15,3l1d85,Explain to me the AMEX Business Model,"I posted about Amex's business model a few months ago, and am currently in the midst of reading through their 10K to get a sense of what the revenue drivers of each business segment are and their competitive advantages.

Can someone give me a gut check to make sure my understanding Amex is correct and what other factors I'm not considering? 

**U.S. Card Services – USCS**

* $16.5B in revenue
* $3.2B in profit
* Primary Revenues: Amex makes the bulk their the money from this segment (~50%) via discount fees on US-based merchants (i.e. fees that are charged per swipe, which are higher than Visa and MC because Amex cardholders tend to spend much more per transaction due to their generally higher affluence). Other sources of revenue from this segment are annual card fees, interest on card balances, travel commissions, and loans to card holders. 
* Primary Expenses: Marketing/promotion/advertising, rewards (MR redemption), Co-Brand Fees (e.g. payment to Starwood for SPG card) 

**International Card Services – ICS**

* $5.1B in Revenue
* $.41B in profit
* Primary Revenues: Amex makes the bulk of the money from this segment via discount fees on non-US-based merchants (i.e. fees that are charged per swipe, which tend to be higher than Visa and MC because Amex cardholders tend to spend much more per transaction due to their generally higher affluence). Other sources of revenue from this segment are annual card fees, interest on card balances, travel commissions, and loans to card holders. 
* Primary Expenses: Marketing/promotion/advertising, rewards (MR redemption), Co-Brand Fees.

**Global Commercial Services – GCS**

* $4.768B in Revenue
* $1.534B in profit
* Primary Revenues: Most of the money is generated from corporate payment services to large and mid-tier businesses such as expenses management. How does this work though? Does Amex charge a large company x% of spend to manage their expenses? Flat-fee? Or is Amex simply breaking out the discount revenue from merchants derived from corporate cards? If so, why is the profit margin so high in this segment? 
* Primary Expenses: Marketing/promotion/advertising, and rewards (MR redemption).

**Global Network and Merchant Services – GNS**

* $5.64 in Revenue
* $1.66B in profit
* Primary Revenues: Point of sale products, financing, and other services to merchants. Additionally, this segment also includes revenue derived from partnership agreements with 3rd party card issuers. For example, Santander Bank might issue an Amex-branded card internationally, and would pay Amex licensing fees to use their network and brand. 
* Primary Expenses: Marketing/promotion/advertising and card member services. 


**Questions**

* Where does the loss of Costco hurt them? Surely USCS, but I feel the market is overestimating the true cost. What else does Amex get from this other than 100% of the discount fees from Costco? Also, wouldn't any decline in revenue be partially offset by a drop in Cobrand-related expenses? 
* What does a merchant really get out accepting Amex? I've seen that Amex cardholders charge on average 2x that of other cardholders. However, I still have trouble grasping if this makes makes it worth it for a merchant. Despite personally being a loyal Amex cardholder, if a merchant tells me that they don't accept Amex, I don't really have much of a problem giving them my Visa card instead. Additionally, I'm not going to tell them after I've been rung up to reduce my total bill just because I can't put it on an Amex. Just doesn't seem like a merchant would really lose that much more business by choosing not to accept Amex. 
* Are discount revenues a part of each business segment? Or is it just USCS and ICS? ",7

15-09-16,3l4ehj,Fed rate hike,"It's hard to say what Yellen is going to do on Thursday, however, it's not impossible for her to hike rates. Given that GDP was revised and raised from 2.2 to 3.7, some advisers have been urging her to hike rates --since the overall economy tends to seem robust at the moment. Given the recent massive manipulation in the equities market by institutions, and their approach to inculcate fear and slightly rattle the fed/market participants, Yellen has tasted a sample of the gargantuan sell-off to come should she hike rates. I don't think that the sell-off was enough to influence her upcoming decision, but it's definitely something she's taking into account on a micro scale, not a macro one. Honestly, if she chooses not to hike rates, it's also possible for the market to STILL suffer a major sell-off, so don't think what most people are thinking (i.e. she hikes rate and equities/futures markets plunge or she doesn't hike the rate and both markets spike and prosper). 

My opinion is that she will not hike rates until December. It's clear that Yellen's approach is ideal, in that she wants to gradually increase rates as opposed to hiking it up a lot in one shot, however, time is not in her favor so I hope she has some contingency plan should she not hike rates this coming Thursday.

I hope she does hike rates, but it doesn't seem likely.

15-09-16,3l4nl4,Implied volatility in UVXY and Vix products,"Wtf fam. 20% drop in UVXY with this laser bear market shit and my 7-month and 13-month ATM put options with 43, 55, and 80 strikes bought 7/1, 8/24, and 9/11 have actually FALLEN in value by 4% as of today. Same thing with 7-day puts.

*NASTY ASS IV SHIT FOR SURE* But why wouldn't there be? Check out the chart on this [bad boy](http://imgur.com/ZA19rSY).   

This motherfucker's asset structure is yolo long positions on short-term volatility index futures indefinitely. When some candyass futures expire, UVXY just goes on and buys the next month's one. However, about 80%±30% of the time later-dated vix futures are priced higher than earlier-dated ones (contango deeznuts). Therefore, *UVXY LOSES MONEY* every time it closes an expiring long position and opens a new one; 50-110% of the time.

Wow, free money right? Good luck getting UVXY to short though. Put options also have limited effect as everyone knows UVXY is trending down AF. At least there's [SVXY](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3j6bxn/full_yolo_on_svxy/) fam.

I am 23 years old and over the past 6 months, I have been doing lots of research and reading over materials ranging from how to begin to reading books about successful stock traders and their stories. 

My questions that I have are: 

I currently use TradeKing, I have not heard many people talk about site usage on here that much. Was curious if I should be looking into a different site to utilize?

What kind of tools or resources do you use to monitor things in the market? 

I have a sense that people usually try and start around $2K to put in for an investment. However, I only have about half of that to start off with. Should I wait to hit $2K or is it okay to start off with around a thousand? If so, does any one know where I can go to research more about starting out with a small investment? 

I know the old saying, ""Buy low, sell high"". However, what is your best advice that you could share with me on my endeavors in this field. 


Thank you!

I’m here to deliver a stock with the potential to jump from $7 to $14 with drug approval. Similar to [ICTI TODAY]( http://imgur.com/fgel2Kw). The approval in October is the main catalyst to watch for.

BioDelivery Sciences International (BDSI) is a specialty pharmaceutical company with an upcoming PDUFA date on October 23rd for BELBUCA, a pain management drug using BDSI’s patented buccal film delivery method. 

News regarding BELBUCA approval’s likelihood has been *very* positive lately, with positive data presented last week. [HERE](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/endo-pharmaceuticals-and-biodelivery-sciences-present-new-data-on-investigational-product-buprenorphine-hcl-buccal-film-for-chronic-pain-management-300139366.html)

[HERE]( http://seekingalpha.com/article/3496236-biodelivery-sciences-internationals-drug-belbuca-likely-to-receive-fda-approval)
Further positive news came last week with a Tennessee Medicaid agreement for distribution of another BDSI drug, Bunavail. [HERE]( http://www.zacks.com/stock/news/189487/biodelivery-up-on-striking-deal-with-tenncare-for-bunavail?cid=CS-YAHOO-FT-189487) .

There are also 2 presentations at upcoming healthcare conferences to discuss progress with BELBUCA and BUNAVAIL. One today, and one next Tuesday. [HERE]( http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/biodelivery-sciences-to-present-at-the-6th-annual-credit-suisse-small--mid-cap-conference-and-the-ladenburg-thalmann-2015-healthcare-conference-300140838.html). This should provide a solid outlook for the future, and positive news to spur prices.

Overall, BDSI has been trending strongly upwards lately ahead of its upcoming FDA approval, with a catalyst for doubling investments coming in 1 month. A wealth of positive indicators provide strong support for an approval and price spike, and a low current price is an easy entry point.

TL ; DR – It’s like knowing the lottery numbers a month in advance. This stock is going to blow up and double within a month. Yachts for everyone.

I have a pretty complicated excel spreadsheet that keeps track of it all for me, so if anyone wants to try it out as a trial run, I'd be happy to share it.

* I don't have a way to bring the price of the stock down, it can only increase at this point and I'd like it to raise and fall, but overall rise as the game evolves.                                                                                              
* I'd like to see some way to be able to have an overall ""market economy"" that effects all the stocks, maybe based on how many transactions occurred in the turn.

Main points:
1) Square and Twitter just teamed up to make political donations doable through tweets, the first collab between the two companies...
2) Early investor Chris Sacco is tweeting with short-term vocab about why the board needs to just make it official already
3) Re/code is reporting that several on board feel strongly he's the best candidate...Dorsey has leverage
4) (sort of a tangential one) Square and Twitter HQ are a block away from each other...

Currently planning to sell today ~25% at $3.25 or ~50% at $3.00 depending on how it runs towards the end of day. Getting very risky to be in this deep. Usually a decent spike around 3pm and a sell off in the last minutes.  

Axion simply cannot afford to miss this deal without bankruptcy, not to mention delisting in October, which is why it's getting scary that they haven't announced positive news yet. They should be willing to sacrifice a family member to get the deal done.  

If positive news does happen, get in early or don't get in at all. There will be a flood of knives happening and many people left holding a bag. Could be a $5 bag or a $10 bag, but either way don't be that guy. I would recommend taking a safe play like I am and pick a target to sell a portion to minimize risk. Bad news will have this baby tank under a $1 most likely. I'm preparing for the real possibility that all my shares will be utterly worthless.

* How often to people buy/sell stock.. Daily? Month to month?
*  What happens if you buy $500 worth of stock and say it doubles in 2 weeks and you want to sell it - do you have to pay taxes on it immediately, or at the end of the year do you just pay taxes on any money you've earned?

SVLC is at a price of .82 right now
Firs majestic is at a price of 2.98

The deal states that shareholders will get .2769 common share of first majestic and .13669 share of new svlc
This gives a value of (2.98 X .2769) .825162 per share of silvercrest in share of AG.
Then on top of that you get 13.6% of the value of whatever new silvercrest is worth. If it doesnt go down in value then it would be worth (,82*.1667) .136694. 
On top of that all shareholder get .0001 in cash money.
This makes the value of a SVLC share after merger at .961956!!!
 Thats an increase of 17.31%


Please correct me if I'm wrong, but to me it seems like a bi**hin deal and that most people just don't realize it for some reason.

Co announced the presentation of preclinical data demonstrating the molecular rationale for the clinical development of CYC065, Cyclacel's second-generation cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, to treat hematological malignancies, including acute leukemias and lymphomas.

The data showed that a range of CDK9-dependent acute myelogenous leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines were sensitive to CYC065. The cell line panel represented different genetic characteristics of hematological malignancies correlating with poor prognosis, including MLL rearrangements and myc amplification or overexpression.
CYC065 was also shown to combine effectively with standard cytotoxic agents, such as cytarabine, and with agents targeting apoptotic regulators, including Bcl-2 inhibitors, such as venetoclax",3

15-09-17,3lb3na,5 Common Traits of Successful Investors,"Successful investors are bold and yet conservative. They appear to be reading a crystal ball but in fact make decisions based on realistic data. When one pictures an investor, the mind’s eye sees a whirlwind of an individual, studied yet frenzied, evaluating markets and shooting at the moon.

The reality is that investors are everyday people, using information from a myriad of sources, including their financial advisors, to make informed decisions and take some risk to be ready for the future. While every person is different, the most successful investors share a few common traits.

Successful investors are… passionate
Successful investors became so by being passionate about investing. Each does their due diligence, looking over balance sheets, talking to executives, observing the potential investment to see if it fits in with their investment strategy and the best time to buy in or walk away. They live and breathe the game of investing because they are playing to win.

“Wealth is only a benefit of the game of money. If you win, the money will be there.” – J. Paul Getty

You: Take the time to do some research and ask questions about investments in which you are interested. Study the market before you make a go or a no go decision.

Successful investors are… patient

15-09-16,3l8j30,PGN or OGZPY (ParagonOffshore VS Gazprom),"So I've only been 'buying' stocks for about a week. Mostly penny stocks (DEJ, NETE, NRP). I think Oil is due for a rally or at least a smart long term bet. 

Paragon Offshore PLC (PGN), is currently going for .53$ and 80$ (don't have loads of cash to spend), could net me a 100 shares. Conversely I could drop the money Gazprom requires for 500 shares. They have four drillships, 2 semi submersibles and 34 jackups for shallow water drilling. Their fleet status report shows contracts through 2017, especially with Petrobras (PBR)

http://www.paragonoffshore.com/our-fleet/Fleet-Status-Reports/default.aspx

My favorite is Gazprom PAO (OGZPY). Currently sitting at 4.33$. I'd be spending around 428$ for 100 shares. They have a dividend of .22$ per share and a market cap of 49.7B. Profit is up 29% (8/31) and they signed a joint venture with Argentina YPF (9/4). Russia is in hot water over Ukrain and Syria but once energy recovers and time passes, maybe this will be a well positioned company to own. Recent speculation says they may have to push back a dividend increase to 2017 or beyond because of the weak ruble.



Finally I found Petrobras (PBR) through researching PGN. Their a large Brazilian energy company with 18.3B market cap. Don't pay dividends and are valued at 4.93 (9/16), a share. Up 8.70%

Expecting more losses tomorrow because I didn't cut my gains off in time.  Total for the week is oddly enough dead even right now though.

I realize we are all about yachts, but if we all had jobs AND banked a total of 1600 in gains weekly, plus regular income, we would be getting much closer to our yachts.

Not trying to turn this into a post from investing, but just a reminder that we are all in here to get space yachts, but that doesn't mean we get space yachts in one yolo play.  I had gotten really good at cutting off of my gains recently, and not bothering myself about what could have been.  Today I lost sight of the money in hand and it burned me.  

YOLO shouldn't be a phrase we yell when we are watching gains disappear, yolo should be the justification for taking our money when its there, and using it to make more another day.  

IDK, I'm probably just being emotional right now because I didn't make close positions before I left work late, and they tanked on my commute home.  But the safest YOLO bet is always the sure thing.  Set your damn goals for your gains and take them when you hit them.  ",22

But based on what I know about Treasuries and Bonds, I am unable to understand the complete picture of risk and return here.

Here is an example of a bond on Schwab - Schwab Intermediate-Term U.S. Treasury ETF SCHR. I found it by going to Research/ETF/Bond/Intermediate Govt Bond/SCHR. The price is $54.12 right now.

While I get that locking your money into a treasury offers lower returns than stocks on average, and I get that if inflation goes up on say, a nominal treasury bond, then each dollar's spending power is weakened.

But the graph on this ETF is erratic. Up and down, frequently, even throughout the day. I thought bonds and treasuries were a more fixed income with a lower return. Why does it move up and down like this?

Schwab is automatically suggesting TIPS for a moderate conservative ETF portfolio. Can I expect this fluctuating risk to occur in a TIPS ETF same as a stock ETF? Seems to defeat the purpose of investing in a Treasury. Some insight would be appreciated.",3

I totally forgot about the stock until I logged in to my Scottrade account yesterday and seen it has gone up significantly. I'm a complete amateur at stocks so I decided to sell 100k shares as I could use the money for some overdue bills.

15-09-18,3legng,$AXPW - pump and dump,These are the facts   1. The company has never made a penny of profit since its inception in 2003.    2. The company is going to be delisted from the Nasdaq in less than 1 month. Because of of its negative shareholders equity/accumulated deficit. This is typically a precursor to bankruptcy per investopedia.    3. They do not have enough cash to cover expenses beyond this month.    4. Their only chance to stay afloat is a deal with a Chinese company.     5. They have over 600k warrants that are exercisable when stock price goes above $3.5    6. Given their financially dire position they have ZERO leverage in any deal negotiations with the Chinese company. This makes it less likely of a favorable agreement to be reached.    7. The Chinese company will give them 250k upfront but did not guarantee any money beyond that. 250k would not keep the company operating for long.    8. They have 3 executives that get paid above 200k each year per yahoo finance.     9. They supposedly have revolutionary technology but no one is interested in paying them for it since 2003    10. They have been unreachable for the past few days for any calls or comments.     11.

15-09-17,3ld4m8,AXPW update,"Was very surprised to see no PR or SEC filing today. The timeline set in the LOI said no more than 4 days after final negotiations (deadline 13th, so today is 4) but maybe tomorrow morning could be used as a loophole saying ""we waited the 4 days and THEN filed before market opened on day 5.  

Jackwagons on ST have been reported to be calling Axion all week with no answer, and judging by the average IQ of the members they probably did call not knowing what to ask. If it's true, I'm not surprised they didn't answer since they outsource their IR and PR to professional firms. These guys are some engineers in rural Pennsylvania who make batteries and it makes sense they would pay to have someone else handle the SEC/NASDAQ issues and all PR matters.  

So today some wack-adoo on ST supposedly called the PR firm, who had to look up the Axion Power account. When he asked her about the status of the licensing deal with LCB International, she corrected him with ""you mean the merger, right?""  He of course was speechless. She then transferred him to the Axion rep who communicates with her firm for PR matters, and that Axion employee's phone was (surprise) unanswered.  

We all know to take ST users with a grain of salt, but this guy's posts have been quick to call out pumpers, and try to discuss legitimate thought processes. He's been helpful to explain to the uninformed how to sign up for IR emails, and vocal for a while about the lack of communication with shareholders. If he really does hold ~25k shares then I'd believe he did call. That's if he actually is so heavily invested.  

Stocktwits is full of 99.99% nonsense but every now and then there's the 0.01% guy who knows what the fuck he's talking about. Case in point, you'd never know that /u/theycallme1 is serious on the BGMD board unless you're on here because he'd get assumed to be part of the 99.99%  

What is the point of this nonsense? I still keep my short-term price target of a positive outcome on licensing at minimum $5 with a spike seeing $7s before dropping back to $5.  Bad news release is still sub $1.00 before the bankruptcy.  With the possible buyout/merger I have no fucking clue, but $10 is very possible with the low float and the amount of day traders this sees. Anytime volume starts to cross 1mil before noon, there's a giant influx of volume in the 2-3 mil for 1 hour, 30% spike, and then selloff.  

Just another friendly heads up of a potential 1 day giant gainer stock that (if good news comes) will be free fucking money to whoever can get in fast and ride the wave before the selloff.

**The Apple Hype Machine Strikes Again**

*Investors lose money!*

Every harvest season, the world’s most valuable company, Apple Inc. does a major release. The media machine goes into overdrive and we are all pulled into their PR vortex.

Even the money men of Wall Street get involved with trading volumes doubling on the day. But the result is toxic, at least to any day-trader speculating on good news. As financier Bernard Baruch pointed out:

&gt; Don’t try to buy at the bottom and sell at the top. It can’t be done, except by liars.

**How Bad Did the Speculators Do?**

Apple’s hype machine targets developers and journalists alike in June and September. June is preview day, with developers getting to test out the software. September is launch day, with new features &amp; phones released for sale.

It’s been the same cycle for 5 years, from iOS5 to iOS9. And it doesn’t matter if you look at the performance of Apple Inc.’s stock on the Preview Day or the Launch Day, it’s been a miserable trade.

So often, the adage *“buy the rumor / sell the news”* proves itself accurate. When the hype settles down, and investors get back to basics, looking at the fundamentals &amp; valuation of a business like Apple, the reality comes through. A pretty nice reality, if you own Apple stock.

Anyone who bought the stock after the disappoint of Preview Day in June, and sold before the hype of Launch Day in September, would largely have done well, both absolutely and relative to the S&amp;P 500.

Of course, you could interpret this data another way! That the smart speculator could profit nicely from the Apple hype, as long as they judge correctly, how much hype is already in the price.

**The Buy and Hold Alternative**

I’m not trying to single out Apple Inc., but to use it as an illustration of the difficulties of day-trading. As Buffett’s mentor, Benjamin Graham pointed out:

In the short run, the stock market is a voting machine. But in the long run it is a weighing machine.
How does any day-trader know how if the vote today is going to turn our positive or negative?

Instead to trying to time the market or day-trade, you could sleep better and use your time more wisely by looking for great long-term investments.

[Spencer Jakab](https://twitter.com/Spencerjakab) an author and one of the best journalists at the Wall Street Journal, shared the figures with me recently.

&gt; Think of $10,000 invested at the top of the market in 2000. 15 year’s later you’d have over $22,000 to show for your patience.

&gt; If you’d timed the market badly, and miss the 10 best days for the market, that’s just 1o days out of 4,000, you’d have cut your returns to $11,000. i.e. virtually nil.

&gt; If you’d missed the 20 best days over the 15 years, you’d only have $7,000 to show for your efforts.
It is an extreme example of the dangers of market timing. But a useful one, nonetheless.

And if that doesn’t convince you to stop trying to time the market or day-trade, take it from one of Australia’s most colorful businessmen, Rene Rivkin:

&gt; I have never met a rich chartist.

15-09-18,3le2hk,Soon to be graduate with a desire to invest.,"Hey guys, new to investing. I've always been interested in getting more from my cash, but am not that informed about it. I only took a 2nd year course in financial mathematics, which isn't anything to show other then I'm not completely clueless.

I'm a Math and CS dbl major, and I'm a software developer currently on an internship making pretty good cash. It occurred to me that because I'm pretty informed in the tech space, that I could potentially leverage my knowledge to help make wise investments.

I have an outstanding debt &gt; $25,000. (I don't need to make payments for 6 months after graduation). 
I got into a few discussions with people about whether paying debt off first is the wise option or if investing my money now is if returns &gt; debt interest rate.

After some online research, it seems that I could definitely spread the debt out. I do not see myself making some sort of house down payment until 30. 

So after giving you some background, I would like some help with the following:

1. How can I get into investing? I want to make large returns, and have heard index funding can give you 10%+ returns.
2. Does my tech knowledge help me in the slightest? 
3. I have a little over 10,000 saved just chilling in a student account.  This money makes me feel safe, but I could definitely invest half of it if needed.
4. Am I being a bit delusional with expected returns? I want to make safe investments, but at the same time am not educated in this field. Would it be better to let someone handle my money for a fee?

The funny thing is, I really don't think anybody knows what to do. The economic crisis of 2007 and the ultra fast News media cycle made sure that the main stream media and its audience was well enough educated, that the usual tongue and cheek cryptic Fed bullshit googly moogly statements wouldn't fly anymore.

The biggest danger to the Recovery has been common man armed with social media asking basic questions which these financial geniuses cant find answers for.

15-09-18,3lf5i4,"Brazil's Recession and its Effect on the World Economy","After China, it is Brazil's turn to deliver bad news to the markets.

The South American country's economy entered a recession after reporting two consecutive quarters of decline in growth.The recent announcement is a technicality: Brazil's economy has been suffering for some time now.

The country was part of the BRIC – Brazil, Russia, India and China – grouping, which was supposed to usher in a new world economic order through prolific growth rates in the coming years. For some time at the turn of this decade, that seemed to be true in Brazil's case. The country racked up impressive growth rates on the back of a boom in commodities and energy exports. Even in the face of conservative analyst predictions, the Brazilian government maintained that it would achieve average growth rates of 4.5% in the coming years.

But, Brazil's economy has unraveled since 2013. A complex cocktail of rising inflation, droughts and corruption scandals has engulfed the country, and it has become the worst performer among BRIC markets. (See also: Understanding The Risk In The BRICS.)

So, what happened?

15-09-18,3lg81q,"Overbought on my account, software still shows I have margin power left. Derp, maybe there's something we can all learn from this, or maybe all teach each other from this. May be margins just confusing..","I wasn't sure where to post this since it does seem to be WSB material, but I'm banned there! To see further details of my trades see /r/wallstreetfails, where I attempt to learn.

Eitherway, onto the story...

Well it was 9:30am and I saw the TA from 16:00 yesterday and started making modest buys here and there... about half the size of my general daytrade purchase. My rule of thumb with TA is that if it's already following the trend, buy. Very simple to follow and execute, I have major issues on exits though... But thats not the story! Just some preface on how I trade

So... 9:45 rolls around which means my TA now has todays first believed gainers. I've done this strategy yesterday, and while I did end up green this is the last time I'll be trading like this.

So I went down the list of TA, here's a complete list of my day.

First thing was first, I had a shiney new edge account which meant I could make aftermarket orders, ooo-la-la.

1300 of ESV @ 16.87 (I even said ""this is gonna drop to the 15s, but maybe itll spike up once more)

Upon waking up, I see my favorite stock, ESV, not doing so hot, so I double up when it's at 16.00. This thing will recover after all.

Well, this was before any TA induced buys, so I tossed 300 ATVI at Market into my new edge account to. ATVI is not a daytrader obviously, but I can't be all daytrader... can  I?

So the TA came rolling in.... I guess I could do this with a picture,. but eh fuck it.

It started with my margin account, non merrilledge but still merrill something (ALL of these purchases were market)

300 SH @ 22, 300 DOG @ 24.29, 300 SDS @ 22.25, 1000 BDSI @ 7.45, 1000 EXEL @6.32 , 1000 SGYP @ 7.68, 1000 PVG @ 5.64, 1000 BVN @ 6.80, 257 PPL @ 31.02, 300 SPXS @ 20.29.


At this point I'm looking at my margin buying power, it's at 7k, that's low so I figure I'll move onto my edge account to make some trades. It's not margin, so I know I can't get the cash back from a sale, so I can't go crazy, but I can fill a few more trades, it'll become a margin account sooner or later anyway.

Thinking back to it, the only smart move I made was buying ATVI in my edge cash account, I should probably keep value buys in cash accounts... that might've made more sense.

Eitherway I bought 300 SPXU @37.51 , 1000 SFUN @ 6.06, 500 TZA @ 11.26, 700 ISIL @ 11.52

Almost immediatly after the last trade execution I get a call from my FA. It goes a little something like this.

""Hey! So the brokerage doesn't even seem to know yet, but you overbought! Your way over your limit!""

""Huh, I still have margin buying power, I did get a regulation T when I accidently tried to purchase to much but that was it""

""Yeah, well, that software is wrong. Once your all on edge it should be more accurate.... so... yeah you overbought""

"".... Guess I'll sell some stuff....""

""Alrighty! Were closing that account soon anyway, but they'll disable it when they notice.""

""Well, thanks for telling me I overbought... I really had no idea I just thought I was heavily deep into margin""

Sell 1000 SFUN, 700 ISIL, 500 TZA, 300 SPXU, 100 ESV from the edge account... not sure if that was even an issue but I figure better safe than sorry at this point (it's a cash account with 50k, not sure how I was allowed to buy more... hmm)

And then for the margin account... I just had to sell off 257 PPL, 1000 PVG, 1000 BDSI, and 1000 EXEL and I think I'm back in the saftey range.... I'll find exactly how much I lost from my rediculous buys and sells, but I imagine it ended up down $50. 

A few of the TA picks did gain quite well in the time of purchase and phone call, I was kinda bummed I had to sell the winners litterally seconds after buying them. But is that how TA intratrading is supposed to work?


All this before 10am..... Well, thats the last time I'll be doing that. I had much more success just buying two stocks and selling them over and over.... though I'm not sure if I'm red from the TA or not. Once oil gets back up a dollar or two I'll be happily in the green I think...


So, a lesson? Maybe don't do what I did, and trade your entire account balance before 10am, even if your planning to intratrade throughout the day. 

As for overbuying, I'm really unsure... It still says I have margin buying power so I'm just downright confused on that note, but hes the FA and all, and I was just using the software... part of me want's to say the software was correct but that's just the programmer in me x(.

Well, hopefully you've learned from my funny morning. I think I may have.....",0

15-09-18,3lfi9j,Family friend picks stocks for us. Exception case (20% CAGR) - please advise.,"Hello all,

Throwaway because my main account is rather identifiable to friends and family.

My father passed this year, leaving us enough to pay off the house, and we are left with about $850k in various accounts. I run my family's finances at this point- I have an Excel model for the future, and watch our expenses/budget (YNAB). My widowed mother, I would say, is close to FI. She also works, which helps. I also work, and will be personally FI in 10-15 years. 

I have a family friend (my late dad's close friend) who is very, very good at picking stocks. He has returned net 20% CAGR the past 20 years. He has an MBA from a top top MBA program, several years at a hedge fund before he opened his own shop. He began by investing around $12M paid in capital from some clients, friends and family (he comes from an extremely successful family-- first two generations, his mother and brother, are entrepreneurs who started and sold $20M+ businesses). He subsequently grew it to $60M and retired (he invests just for friends and family now). He invests our money. He is a value investor, generally holds equities for 2-4 years. He does not charge us fees. He is, by performance, one of the 100 best value investors in the world. He has maintained his performance whilst generally keeping 20% of his portfolio in cash. Which is, suffice it to say, quite impressive.

Now, I've thought long and hard about this. I'm a big reader of Nassim Nicholas Taleb, and I'm quite sure Daniel Kahneman would be rather skeptical.

My main question is: how would you think about this in determining the best way to getting mother to FI? I find that I trust him because of his track record of success, but I can't help as a result of Kahneman and Taleb think that it's difficult if not impossible at the very least to accurately determine what proportion of my family friend's success comes from luck or skill. Kahneman would cite his study of that financial firm for which he concluded that less than half a percent of the success came from skill- or, rather, a statistically insignificant amount. Taleb would perhaps call my family friend the Shakespeare Monkey- put enough monkeys in a room with typewriters, for a long enough period, and eventually one will write Shakespeare. 

I will say that generally the stocks he picks are what he perceives to be undervalued stocks, many of which are blue chip and thus not too far removed from, say, buying VTSAX. 

Thanks all for your input. ",0

15-09-18,3lfmpb,What’s Your Investing Horror Story?,"Some story to start =)
We are at the end of summer 2006. I had been trading since 2003 with great success and especially that year. I’m up 71% with my portfolio and I feel that everything I trade turns into gold. While I’m having great success with my trades, I’m also having great success in real estate. I just successfully sold my house and I’m going to buy another one in November. Everything is going smoothly ;-D

 

But there is this stock: Northern Shield Resources (CVE: NRN). I’ve been making a few plays on it and making some really good profit. I’m well aware that it’s a speculative mining stock but until then I had made a lot of money on it. I actually bought my shares at $0.38 the first time and the stock went up to $1.40 a few months later. In August, I decided to use part of the down payment for my future house to average up and buy more stock at $1,00 or so. In September, I then had $15,000 invested in NRN with an average price of $0.76. I’m still making profit but holding my position as the company will announce results of their latest prospecting in a few weeks.

 

I already made plans as to how I will spend my extra profits. I truly believe the stock will rise to a few bucks (maybe $5 if I’m lucky!) and that I will have enough money to not only buy my house, but a  BMW and a nice trip down south at the same time… my wife is going to be so proud of me!

 

So I go for lunch with a few friends on a casual day at work. I always look at my positions when I come back from lunch. Not that it ever changes anything but I like to see where my portfolio is at in the middle of the day ;-). It was a sunny day, lunch was great and we laughed a lot; it was just another great day in my life… until I looked at my computer screen and saw my portfolio.

If you look at the long term graph of both VXX (etf that holds 2 month VIX futures), it heavily points downwards since it were created. Despite the long term VIX remaining flat or modestly downwards trending, I think i've read VXX loses a lot because it is constantly buying/selling futures, and other fees in order to maintain correct allocations.

Would it make sense to make trades where you short sell VXX, but since it is volatile, set limit orders to cover 10-15% above the buy price. Since this ETF are volatile, these limits are set, however in the long run very few of these will trigger and you can let them ride down as the long term graphs show a huge loss of value in the long term.

After reading (http://finance.yahoo.com/news/newly-appointed-acting-ceo-outlines-235400461.html) It seems like they have some promising products. They are aiming to begin clinical trials in 2016.

Also looking at their stock chart (http://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVGN&amp;ty=c&amp;p=d&amp;b=1) It looks like it bottomed out and maybe will bounce back.

Super specific and kind of odd, sorry if I worded it poorly. If you don't know the answer but know of a better subreddit to ask this in could you let me know?",3

15-09-18,3lfxpl,"I need an honest answer, Have I just been insanely lucky or do I have a legitimate investing strategy.","Ok so I started Investing in Feb 2015, my background is a Business degree with a financing major. I'm currently working on my professional accounting designation in Canada. 
So I know a bit about the financials of a company, and can read between the lines etc. 

How I go about investing, is basically by trying to value a company based on its assets, cash, ""hidden assets"" as I call them (IE undervalued Real estate sitting somewhere) basically using all the accounting knowledge I have to try and come up with if a company is undervalued or overvalued. 
Once I get a number I flag that company. Whenever it drops below the number (as long as nothing has happened IE lawsuits etc) I'll buy it. Then generally it will float above it in a few weeks, days, months then I unload. Rinse and repeat.  

I've also been trying to look at possible acquisition targets and so on. 

I've been doing this with a number of oil companies in Canada and Its turned out to be quit profitable and I am wondering if its because the method is have is reasonable or if its because I have just had great luck.  (Note: I have been killed on a few stocks, ERF + CPG to name a few) 

This is my portfolio snapshot so far

It hasn't updated for September obviously, but I am at about 16% as of this morning. 
I just want to stay away from getting cocky and getting too confident when what was contributing to my success was luck rather than proper analysis.

15-09-18,3lgwoz,I bought BIB(2X biotech ETF). Check if my reasoning is correct,"Yellen's statement on rates makes it seem like we won't have an increase for a very long time, surely not by the end of the year at least. In this ZIRP environment, winners should be companies who need cheap debt, and the losers should be companies who issue that debt. Since companies who do RnD need a lot of capital, naturally low interest on that debt would be beneficial to them. And since biotech is almost all RnD, they'd be the ones to benefit the most in this environment.

There's also no way the consumer demand for new breakthroughs will ever decrease. People will spend whatever it takes- biotech isn't a luxury for the most part. And with the increasingly likelihood, like it or not, that our healthcare system will become more socialized, that should bring even more cash into the sector.

Studies for days!! Here are my indicators to I confirm if I should buy: [Full gallery](http://imgur.com/a/3CZC6)

Forgive my noobness. when I mean BUY, I mean Bullish if I ever said it below.


[Study 1](http://i.imgur.com/wZ62MRh.png): 
---
-Volume exploding
-Bulls are taking over. 5:1 over bears. No chance for bears.

5/5 - PASSED

[Study 2](http://i.imgur.com/B1b4LSK.png):
---

-Blue arrow in the top graph indicates when to bullish best.

-Spearman; When the white line is above the yellow line, time to bullish.

-StochRSI: Red line above purple line: Bullish. It even cut off because it is through the roof!

-LBR: Blue line above yellow: Bullish

-SVEZ: Blue line above purple: Bullish


6/6 PASSED

[Study 3](http://i.imgur.com/ATtjw2T.png):
---
-Momentum: Up = Bullish

-Chande: Over 50 = actually overbought but yolo, look at the momentum

-PolyMomentum: Up = Bullish

2/3 PASSED

[Study 4](http://i.imgur.com/hlmo0Sy.png):
---
-AwesomeOscillator: Green on the top actually means good time to sell if you had it already. Since you already missed that boat like a month ago when green was at the bottom (good time to buy), just buy in now and pray it doesn't go back down.

-GatorOscillator: Same as Awesome. 

-McCelllan: If above 0, buy. This shit is at 93

-PriceZoneOscillator: Oh-oh, it is about to hit the green dotted line &gt;&gt; About to be oversold but still a little head room.

3/4 PASSED

[Study 5](http://i.imgur.com/HjpBFhf.png):
---
-AccumulationDistribution: Cumulative volume change over time: It went through the roof = Bullish

-Chaikin and AlphaJensen: Pointing up, Bullish.

-UlcerIndex. It doesn't always predict things tho. When the yellow line htis the top it was your chance to buy it for cheap. Doesn't fit the actual thing that happened. Might indicate a pump and dump scenario?

-VortexIndicator (My personal favorite): If the green and red line cross so that the green line is at the top: BULLISH AF!

4/5 PASSED

[Study 6](http://i.imgur.com/WfWHcGJ.png):
---
-Inertia: Shows you the direction of volatility. Volatility is facing upwards: Bullish

-HistoricalVolatility: This combined with the direction of the volatility (Inertia) tells you if it's gonna explode up or down. Since Inertia is point up and volatility is up you could have predicted this thing to explode 2 days ago!! Bullish

-MarketIndicator: General sentiments. If up; Bullish

3/3 PASSED

15-09-19,3liym4,"First I've heard of tax-loss harvesting, thought I'd share","I was looking at Wealthfront, and came across [this FAQ featuring tax-loss harvesting](https://pages.wealthfront.com/faq/). Having held on too long to some stocks I bought too high, I'm thinking I should do something like this.

&gt; Tax-loss Harvesting is a way to make your investments work even harder on your behalf – not just by producing investment returns but by lowering your taxes too.

&gt; Tax-Loss Harvesting works by taking advantage of investments that have declined in value (a common occurrence in broadly diversified investment portfolios). By selling declined investments at a loss, you earn the right to write-off that loss from your taxable income – thus lowering your taxes.

&gt; What’s more, you can replace any investment sold in this manner with a highly correlated alternative investment. The result is that the risk and return profile of your portfolio is unchanged, even as you gain tax savings. These tax savings can then be reinvested to further grow the value of your portfolio.

&gt; Wealthfront developed software to make this service, traditionally only available to accounts in excess of $5 million, available to all taxable client accounts. Between 2000 and 2011, our research shows tax-loss harvesting would have increased your after-tax returns by more than 1.55% a year.

Visa will instead transfer those losses to the merchants themselves.

This is the endgame in the long process of switching U.S. consumers and merchants to the worldwide standard of EMV payment technology (the chip some people have in/on their credit card). The United States is the last major market to adopt EMV.

15-09-18,3lhpub,Help Analyzing Historical Data,"**Newbie Investor**

I was wondering absentmindedly if competitors in the same field generally move together or not. For instance, Coca-Cola and Pepsi are direct competitors, but if market conditions are such that people are buying more Coke they'd also probably be buying Pepsi in my mind. It's not like Coke lovers change to be Pepsi lovers in different scenarios.

Looking at historical data this holds to be true: Pepsi and Coke generally move up and down together. 

However, when I look and see for example that both had significant drops from end of November 2014 to mid-December 2014 is there a way to see if there is any rhyme or reason to this? Can I look and attribute it to Factor X or is it just market irrationality and people all across U.S. happened to be buying less pop in those 2 weeks?? There doesn't seem to be any obvious news that would factor in. Obviously it's very hard to predict market movement going forward, but I hope it's easy to look back and say ""oh I see it moved this way because of this and I learned something based on that""

I started investing last October. This October I'll begin my plan which is to put the worst performing stock on a one year ""probation"". The mendoza line is a loss of 21%. If one my stocks is below that line come next October, they get put on probation. If multiple are below the line, only the worst is put on probation.

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/female-health-company-receives-orders-123000180.html

This company boggles my mind. They have a total 100% domination in the market for their product, the Female condom. Its FDA approved and approved in the EU. They have, to date, sold over 500million units since 1995. Their main buyers are in 3rd world and developing countries with HIV/AIDS issues. The company original CEO from years ago was just hired back after the last CEO took the company from $10/share to $1.50 and then resigned and left the company. 
For years they offered a dividend due to NET revenues every quarter. This attracted hedge funds looking for income. Last fall the prior CEO decided to stop the dividend payments and focus on stock buyback for shareholder value. Since then the stock price has dropped 75%. 
Currently its at 52 week lows and been rolling steady. Most likely due to investors awaiting what the new CEO will do. He has informed investors he is interested in either acquiring a new product or company to increase profits and value.

There was a share buyback a bit ago and since then insiders have been buying up shares here and there (6000-9000 shares). 

It looks like a good time for a long position for anyone looking to catch what might come of the new (prior) CEO and what he wants to do. 

As of the last annual meeting on March 19th, 2015 the company has clearly stated that they have evaluated over 75 products/companies, they are negotiating with top targets and there will be an acquisition in calendar 2015. The company is looking for a complementary product(s) to its condom – mainly in the female reproductive, infection prevention and intimate health space.
(Note this was from the prior CEO who resigned in August)

I guess I had always assumed that you would pay a premium for future growth, not a discount. Is it just that the fear for their industry position is so much greater for the old tech giants than for a company like Coke or Pepsi? It's to the point where some of these companies are actually trading at similar valuations as electric utilities, and I would presume that the expected future value for an investment in the tech giants would be much larger than a utility, which are fairly low.

But, it should be obvious to options traders if a stock is low volatility and will continue to be directionless at least for a month or two.

I won't call them idiots, because I'm probably the idiot, I just don't understand how everything isn't already priced in. Unless of course that's the whole point to options...

15-09-19,3lkpua,AMDA DD — NASDAQ (non-compliant) — .436 (3mo play 80-150%),"So its time to look at one of Reddit’s favorite stocks AMDA.   This stock was the hopes of many a YOLO dream back in July when everyone waited with baited breath on an FDA verdict that would send the stock to the moon.   Unfortunately that verdict was “we need more info” and the stock slumped from nearly .80 to the .50s where it lingered until AMDA decided they needed money more than stockholders and decided to dilute to raise money.  But dilution is not a good thing with a NASDAQ price delisting notice in hand and so this weekend AMDA piles on with a reverse stock split notice.   So is this company still the good bet I once thought it was?   Lets find out.

-

**Note**

-

Because of an upcoming reverse split any price targets will need to be adjusted accordingly after the split.  The reverse stock split is also a negative catalyst and will weigh on the stock.

-

After publication the following modifications were made:

* Added a screenshot of an email to the CEO which pertains to the stock split.
* Added a section to the stock split discussion which factors in NASDAQ compliance on top of FDA is a positive catalyst since AMDA would be  margin stock at that point.
* Added in a Timeline section which explores the timeline for an FDA decision which could extend the play to a 6mo hold because of the holidays.

-

**The Company**:

-

AMDA makes silicone nitride products and is awaiting approval from the FDA for use of its products in spinal replacement.   The company has, in the past, shown impressive results in preventing bacteriological infection that plague titanium and PEAK replacement sources and bone seems to grow into silicone nitride making it a more organically friendly material (However note that bone growth may be a liability if the material ever has to be replaced in the future) so there is a chance that this is indeed a revolutionary material.

-

This company has never been profitable and has used its shareholders as piggy banks to finance about $2 million dollars a month in losses.

-

I didn’t try and count up all the outstanding shares.   Suffice it to say there is a buttload of them.   Comparing AQXP to AMDA is like comparing Usain Bolt to Fat Albert.   Hey Hey Hey it’s AMDA!

-

A lot of the talk of increasing share price centers around partnership agreements, one disclosed and three remaining to be disclosed but are likely contingent on FDA approval of its silicone nitride product in spinal devices.  The problem is that we have never received details on the first partner or seen any benefits to the company from that partner.   Shareholders have ferreted out that it is probably [Ortho Development](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3f01ud/everyone_get_back_in_amda_i_figured_out_who_the/?) but we really don’t know what that partnership is doing for them.

-

So partnerships are a potential catalyst but unless they include names and details they’re not going to impact the stock price that much until they start showing up on the ER.   Q3 ER could be a surprise because of Ortho but at this point it’s not a catalyst.    Note that these could be substantial catalysts AFTER FDA approval.  But you also need to factor in that when the FDA decision comes through a LOT of shareholders are going to be looking for exit points.

-

In August the company announced expansion into the Brazil market which is a new, unpublished, revenue stream which should show up in the next ER.  But their international revenues are minuscule and the Real is not trading favorably against the dollar.  So this should not factor noticeably in their next financials.

-

**Reverse Split and Dilution:**

-
In September the company diluted its shares by ~20%.  There are [provisions which prevent dumping](http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FileName=0001269026%2D15%2D000040%2Etxt&amp;FilePath=%5C2015%5C09%5C11%5C&amp;CoName=AMEDICA+CORP&amp;FormType=8%2DK&amp;RcvdDate=9%2F11%2F2015&amp;pdf=) until November (when the company expects either an FDA decision or a run-up on their stock in anticipation thereof).   The company will also [meet in October](http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FileName=0001269026%2D15%2D000045%2Etxt&amp;FilePath=%5C2015%5C09%5C18%5C&amp;CoName=AMEDICA+CORP&amp;FormType=PRE+14A&amp;RcvdDate=9%2F18%2F2015&amp;pdf=) to to effect a reverse stock split of **up to 1:15** in order to regain NASDQ price compliance.   This meeting will also let the company convert warrants purchased in the September offering into shares.

-

The warning sign here is that the company fully expected to be over $1.00/share in February after FDA.  However with the recent dilution no longer expects that to be true.  Let me restate that again because it should affect your exit targets.  **The company no longer believes it will be price compliant with NASDAQ ($1.00) by February.**

-

**UPDATE** after some revisiting of this, it may be that AMDA simply would like to be NASDAQ compliant by the time the FDA decision comes through which would allow for more upward movement as margin could be used on the stock.   So I will leave the original thought there but also add this thought which would actually make this more of a positive catalyst.

-

**UPDATE** @ray 13 on StockTwits posted an email screenshot of a reply from the CEO in regards to the reverse split.   I am passing this along without comment: http://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_42889390.png?1442687965 .

-

**Catalysts:**

-

* FDA approval of their silicone nitride product for use in spinal replacements.   That’s it.  This is the only catalyst.   The last time we were here the FDA said they wanted the results of a study.  As luck would have it that study concludes in September.   So sometime from October to November the FDA is _likely_ to come back with a real decision this time and again [the FDA approves nearly 95% of applications that have made it through clinical trials](http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2015/08/25/nine-explanations-for-why-the-fda-is-approving-almost-every-new-drug-application/)

If the FDA approves, this MIGHT touch $1 a share, though I personally expect around .90.  If AMDA follows this with a flurry of partnership announcements then yes, I think over a dollar is possible (note these prices will need to be adjusted when the reverse split happens).  I personally would not hold past the FDA spike but it’s an option on the craps table if you want to let some of your profits ride.

-

**Risks:**

-

* FDA: No.  (You will see 20s or lower).
* Timing the FDA.  The shares will spike on on yes verdict so the question is what is too high?  And where in the rush to throw money at the stock are the dilutive shareholders and warrant holders going to start raining shares on the parade?

-

**Timelines:**

-
AMDA’s 24mo clinical study that the FDA asked for concludes in September.   At this point we can expect up to 100 days for the FDA to evaluate the data before reaching it’s decision ( See http://www.newworldreg.com/slideshow.pdf specifically slide 19 [thanks very much upps32!](https://www.reddit.com/user/upps32).   Upps32 also noted that because this is a request for new information and not a re-filing that the result has the potential to be processed quickly.   If you want to be completely safe and play the FDA an early October entry is best.   If you want to chance things, mid to late november may be a safer entry).   **Because of the upcoming holiday season it may be January or February before FDA returns results.**

-

**Fair Valuation**

-

For a fair valuation of the company I present to you [$ATEC](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3jf93p/atec_dd_57_nasdaq/?) a company i did DD on.  This is the company AMDA wants to become.   ATEC has $15m a month in revenue, 68m in debt, 100,000,000 outstanding shares and until last quarter were profitable.   Before their current troubles, ATEC was trading around $1.40.   You can safely assume it will take AMDA at least six months to a year to reach profitability and begin competing with ATEC with several dilutions ahead of them.  So I personally would set anything over $1.25 as over-valued given the risks of becoming profitable in the next year and the further dilution and financing that will be inevitable.  However $1.40 is the range you can expect AMDA to trade in if it becomes a viable enterprise and possibly quite higher if silicone nitride is as revolutionary as the company believes and it can start the process of getting it approved for other bone replacements (including dental).

-

Again, after a good FDA, AMDA may do a flurry of PR about their now enabled partnership agreements.   And the stock could go much higher than my suggested exits, but in regards to this company I would much prefer to leave some profits on the table than risk getting trapped because this is **NOT** a good stock to get trapped in until they achieve profitability.

15-09-19,3lkxj1,Vertical spreads,"I think I'm done with spreads. It feels like the amount of risk compared with the amount of potential gains you can make are very disproportionate. Also the bid-ask spread becomes ridiculous very quickly, to the point where I literally cannot exit positions. If I'm in a situation where I need to exit a position then I'm already fucked, but with spreads if you combine how fucked I already am with how fucked I'm going to be after I get raped and pillaged by this bid-ask spread then it literally doesn't make economic sense to try and save whatever money is left in that position.

2.)Dividends... How long does one have to wait after receiving a dividend? I know that some give them out at different times, IE quarterly. But does that mean that if I know a company is about to pay out dividends I can buy a bunch of their stock right before and receive the dividend? Or do I have to hold the stocks for a while to receive that?

I soon found out I have no technical analysis skills. Looks like the last post on this stock is from a year ago during their FDA approval. I wanted to do a follow up since they have an upcoming catalyst with USPSTF rating of their fecal test and wanted to make you YOLO'ers aware, provide my analysis, and promptly get called a retard if i'm wrong.


Company: 


Exact Sciences Corporation, a molecular diagnostics company, focuses on developing non-invasive colorectal cancer screening products. The company develops the Cologuard, a non-invasive stool-based DNA colorectal cancer screening test that is designed to detect pre-cancerous lesions or polyps, and each of the four stages of colorectal cancer. Its Cologuard test includes proprietary and patented methods that isolate and analyze the human DNA that are shed into stool every day from the exfoliation of cells that line the colon; and also protein marker to detect blood in the stool, utilizing an antibody-based fecal immunochemical test. 


Financials:


I suck at technical analysis, so any help here is appreciated, but this stock has taken a beating the last 3 months on no news, concerns about sales numbers, and a secondary dilution offering to get their sales force and marketing efforts up and running.  ~~210M~~ 389M thanks to the July offering (thanks /u/hideous_coffee for the SA article) in cash, 6M in debt, and 14M in revenue. It has 96M shares outstanding, 92.15% of it's shares held by institutions and currently 25M shorted (as of Aug 31, though probably a bit higher now looking at the price drop).


Catalysts:


EXAS has a USPSTF rating coming up ""soon"" (as of June it was 'coming months') that I expect to be released at the latest in end-October. If it's an A or B rating it should pop since under the ACA, all services with an A or B rating by USPSTF are required to be fully-covered by commercial insurers at no cost to patients which makes it MUCH easier to sell in hospital systems. I am confident they'll get at least a B rating since they've been absolutely blowing the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) out of the water in every metric so far and the FIT test got an A rating.  I am expecting a jump of ~40% on news of a B rating and higher on an A rating.


Risks:


USPSTF rates a C or lower.  If this is the case this stock could drop significantly due to already existing concerns about sales.


Disclosure:  

I am long EXAS with a position in the stock. I like the technology, i don't want a doctor in my asshole and this shit (no pun intended) looks promising. I would use it once i'm old enough to get tested. I am confident on a good rating here from USPSTF since FIT got an A previously. Do your own DD before investing especially since i'm missing a big chunk of analysis on the technical side.

Closing/TL;DR:

USPSTF rating coming in Sept/Oct. A or B rating should see a good jump to $28+. C or lower sees this going back to $12/share. Test that ColoGuard was compared against in clinical trials received an A rating previously so I expect an A, but a B is good too for insurance coverage reasons. If anyone with technical analysis skills could weigh in i'll update my post accordingly.

15-09-20,3lpefq,eking advice on optimal execution of Airbnb-affiliated REIT,"Not sure if forming a REIT is optimal or if managing specific individual's investments would be better, but the gist of my situation is:

- In 2 months, my good friend will be receiving a 10 figure acquisition of his company, provided SEC doesn't discover any monopoly issues (they won't, it's a small acquisition relative to the field size). He's CEO and a lot of the execs, including him, are being replaced or retiring. I will essentially have access, through my friend, to about 7-10 individuals with 8 figures in the bank looking for new investments.

- I've been running an Airbnb business for the last 4 years. We buy properties in zip codes that appear to be profitable via various data sets I've purchased (I have purchase price to rental income [gross airbnb revenue] ratios per zip code in the US), furnish them and turn them into vacation rentals. We have in-field teams in each city that manage each of our listings, and an online management that handles all communication for 3%. It's all very automated. Currently we only have 9 listings, but our ROI on pure cashflow (not including appreciation) has been pretty absurd. For properties we put 25% down, the average return has been around 32%. For cash buys, around 12-15%. If I exclude the money going into principal on the 25% down properties as an expense, it gets closer to 38-40%. 

- I'm likely running above expectation, and as each city gets more saturated with more VRs my income will decrease, however I still have other cities I haven't purchased in/tapped into and I think even 10% would be appealing to the average investor. All of our listings are 5-stars, we respond 24/7 within 1-hour and we use some neat pricing algorithm software so this likely contributes to our over performance. I also recognize that there is legislation in the works to ban/regulate/tax Airbnbs in many cities (e.g. Santa Monica, SF, NYC) - fortunately we're not in any those. Personally I believe Airbnb/VRBO/Flipkey is too big to stop unless the city hires dedicated staff to monitor and regulate, but if a ban did occur then the REIT/LLC/whatever I end up doing would take a hit and I would either sell/move to another city or put in a long term tenant for less return.

My question is: what is the best strategy to get these execs to invest with me? 

Option A) Form a separate LLC with each investor with a min investment amount, and acquire some type of asset loan with higher interest for each LLC to leverage into more properties? 

Option B) Know close to nothing about this, but form an REIT to handle all investments. This option seems more easily scalable.

Option C) ???

I also forgot to mention that the CEO bought two properties through me exactly 1 year ago and we did 15.8% our first year together. I approached him with this idea a few days ago when I learned about the acquisition and he seemed open to it.",17
15-09-21,3lrxto,Help me understand how dividends hastened recovery after the crash of 1929,"I'm struggling to understand a basic concept about how stocks pay out dividends. I used to think dividends were actual cash bonuses paid out by the companies to shareholders. I see now how that is inaccurate.

As Max_Thunder commented in a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3l8o2t/does_anybody_here_save_for_retirement_via/cv49u7u):

&gt;You realize that when a stock gives a dividend, its value goes down by the same amount as the dividend? From a financial point of view, there is no difference between selling stocks and getting dividends. Instead of giving a dividend, a company can takes its revenues to buy back stocks, and whichever the company does, the investors end up with the same money. In an optimal scenario, companies would buy back stocks whenever they are undervalued, and give a dividend whenever the stocks are overvalued. Of course, there are so many investors who love dividends for unwarranted psychological reasons that not giving a dividend would be perceived as a weakness and could make the stock value go down.

However, then I read from Joshua Kennon how reinvesting dividends allowed people to recover from the 1929 stock market crash in just a few years (as opposed to the 25 years often cited by people). 

&gt; looking at Jeremy Siegel’s research, if you had been reinvesting your dividends, you could have broken even in purchasing power in a few years after the bottom.  By the time the stock market reached its previous high 25 years later, you had a large pile of shares bought at once-in-a-century valuations.

http://www.joshuakennon.com/it-did-not-take-25-years-for-the-stock-market-to-recover-from-the-peak-of-the-1929-crash/

Basically, I'm struggling to reconcile these two opinions. If dividends are not actually bonuses paid to shareholders, but are simply sold shares of the company, then why does reinvesting them shorten the recovery time of somebody investing during the Great Depression? After all, simply buying more shares with your dividend would have purchased them at the exact price that you previously sold.

Or, for a more pointed question: as a buy&amp;hold index investor, **why should I care about dividends at all?**

15-09-21,3ls2zi,"""The WSB strategy"" by 21,238 gamblers","/u/BlackDowney Presents (his version of) “The WSB Theory” 

The investment strategy that WSB proposes is one of high risk high reward ratios. The people at WSB enjoy looking at a company, doing DD (even if it is drawing a dragon on a chart) and using risk &amp; reward (R&amp;R) ratios to put their money on. Getting the most bang for you buck is important in this strategy, and having the nerves to execute it are required. 


Currently there is a company with the ticker AVXL, which has a drug in clinical trial 2 tests that can halt the progression of Alzheimer’s. The data seems convincing but this stock is already a buy because it offers a R&amp;R ratio of 1:4-8. Since the market for Alzheimer’s is huge, the potential for money is very high, and a buyout would immediately cause the stock to explode higher disregarding FDA approval. So what does one do? Does one go all in and YOLO? The important thing to note here is that nothing is certain which makes the risk reward ratio higher. I am not suggesting that you invest in a stock where the risk reward ratio is 1:50, because this is also an indicator of how likely that is to happen, while a risk reward ratio of 1:1.1 is too low since major market forces (and volatility) can change this ratio easily similar to the price of an option. 

To increase the risk reward ratio, options should be exercised on large cap stocks, and use market sentiment indicators because its likely that revenues, and products wont move the stock/company much (not as much as small caps). Take a company like AAPL that recently released their apple watch, “new” Iphone 6s, and “new” Ipad. While their products are not as impressive as they once were, they don’t have to be, because people want to upgrade their pre existing devices. Furthermore apple champions simplicity, which is what the majority of users want, so its market share isn’t going anywhere. 


However apple’s stock will move based on foreign currency worries because of exports to other countries may go down, thus reducing sales. BUT!!! Apple wants to counter that with a new plan to trade in your old phone, and that helps alleviate the currency problem. Furthermore, Apple released a new apple TV that many people do not have and may enjoy, and could increase profits. So its clear that the risk and reward ratio is low, and the amount of information one is provided allows you to increase it using options. APPLE currently trades at 113, but it most certainly belongs at $125, and if you are sure, then options are your best bet, and a strike price should be 120$ with an execution date of 3 months ahead so that you have ample time to sell within that period if the price ever jumps up.  (IM not a fucking English major) 


The WSB Theory is a silver bullet theory where one picks the safest high risk stock, or the safest low risk stock, and manipulates the risk. A high risk stock might need to be averaged down, and that is crucial so that your net price remains close to the market price. Having the balls for that is a different story, because you can always run out of money. Regardless one should always double down what they previously “invested” had. 

Say you “”invest”” $2000 into stock “WSB” and it plummets 25% because a large institutional investor wants to take his cash and run. You have the option of putting an additional 2000$ so that you are merely down 12.5% but you should preferably play a 4000$ so that you are only down 8% (net wise). And should the stock plummet another 25% you should invest 8000$ at which point you will surely max out your position because you aint that rich. This leaves you with 12,125 in the position where as you started with $14,000. In this example the stock has plummeted 44% however your portfolio losses are at 14%. If the stock should rebound 14% back up (CASH THE FUCK OUT BECAUSE THIS STOCK SUCKS COCK) you have the option to sell for no losses or keep the stock and begin to make a profit. This is just one example of how effective averaging down is. 

“The WSB theory” is meant to identify risk, and manipulate it based on the market data. It is important to rely on market catalysts “things that may or may not happen” (RUMORS) because this will keep volatility high and a stock may trade sideways for a week or slightly down. Its important to implement averaging down, and (investing in heart attack medication) risk analysis to your picks. 

These are the things I have learned after 2 years of r/WSB
That and 
AAPL calls at 130 never EVER fail.

Tl;Dr: Find risk:reward ratios, average down, go all in, then lose it all and post to WSB

Like a stupid fuck I was day trading 48 dollar puts.  Made literally 80 dollars.  Because I didn't want to hold overnight due to part of them being on margin and not sure what was happening.

I had some 42 dollar puts for this friday that were left over from a straddle where I made some money on the calls.  Decided YOLO, leave my puts alone.  They were purchased at 4.69 (Ouch).  Almost worthless last friday.  I saw I could scoop some for 1.70 and thought fuck it, average down.  Sitting at 2.50.  

UVXY after hours is at 43-44ish.  But the Vix fucking shit itself  I am thinking we will see 35 by EOD tomorrow on UVXY.  Only regret is it wasn't a true fucking yolo.  If it hits 35 though, I'll be sitting pretty at a 25% gain on my portfolio, and a 300% ROI which would be fucking incredible for a Put that I almost sold at a loss on friday to avoid losing my whole premium.

http://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/20/oil-prices-edge-up-as-us-drilling-declines.html

So what's the outlook on drilling?

It seems that for now, oil is up, yet non-US companies arn't recovering from friday.

I see US oil's doing a bit better than international oil, but from what I've heard (not read) we haven't hit our maximum production peak yet, which means unless companies ramp down production (as they say they do in the article) barrel price probably would fall?

Is this companys purposfully keeping crude above a certain threshold? I read elsewhere that some companies don't feel it's worth it to sell oil at under $50/barrel.

Eventually, drilling will resume and assuming this continuing trend barrel price should stay close to 50 unless we ever ramp up production?

Am I looking at this wrong?

tl;dr: hold ESV or sell, i've already stop quoted PBR when they hit there 52 week low today, despite barrels price rising",2

I want to buy a stock for fun, I have some questions (TD Ameritrade)","No I'm not one of those people trying to get rich quick or whatever lol, BUT I would just like to buy a stock or two. I'm one of those people who will like to buy a stock in a company that I like and enjoy. 

I don't plan to sell it off right away, if anything I would just hold it, I don't know how long, but just looking to buy stocks with fine dividends. 

I don't have a lot of money to spend, as I said it's just for fun. 

I just want to know, will this have any implications? Such as, will I have to pay fees every month, or how will this affect my taxes? I'm a college student in Florida. 

I plan to open an account in TD Ameritrade, as I read there's no minimum, though high fees but I am not going to be a day trader. Let's say I wanted to buy one stock of Coca Cola and hold it for like a year, would this be okay to do this in TD Ameritrade? Lol I know it sounds like I shouldn't be doing this, but I won't be blowing off my money or anything, at most 50 dollars (don't worry I know KO is at 39.19 as I right this). I'll use paper trading to do that. 

I appreciate your time for reading my noob question. Thanks

P.S I have read TD Ameritrade's fee's but I just want to make sure from people who may have an account or just know more than me.

15-09-22,3lz4q7,Volkswagen in the long term.,"It will be hard to say when to buy but buying it right now isn't a ""bad buy"".

VW is one of the largest automakers in the world, and makes certainly better vehicles (technologically and quality-wise) than GM - without the bad pension agreements etc. It will survive this, and once the memory has faded it will certainly come back from this. Saying this is a yolo investment when you want to hold for 3 to 4 years or so tells me you don't know Volkswagen and all it's brands and markets. Just roughly spotting the bottom to get a good ride out of this is as always the damn hard part.

18B fine won't stick... it won't. It's the maximum possible fine the EPA could hit them with, should VW not fix the cars. VW have already pretended to fix the cars last december, but that only made their cheating harder to detect. So now the EPA has issued an ultimatum for them to actually fix the cars. Which VW apparently are going to do, since they have started to issue recalls for the affected cars. So they will most probably pay a high fine.
The other component is the class action lawsuit that could follow. It is unclear at this moment how much the activation of the emissions control systems will hurt milage/power of the affected cars. Though going by similar lawsuits against other manufacturers, VW could end up agreeing to pay severall hundred million dollars. (Several grand per affected car.)
Shortterm this hurts, but longterm it won't make a dent. It seems the people selling their shares now are seeing the massive number and are panicking unduly.

To summarize this all up, I bought $20,000 shares of COP @ 42.19 and just sold them at 48.68 making roughly $3000. I'm going to be putting in $20,000 into Volkswagen.

15-09-21,3ltx3d,The solar industry,"Why aren't you invested in solars yet? Let's look at the facts here; unsubsidized LCOE of solar is 6-8c/kwh around the world today. Cost is falling more than 10% per year. Fossil energy costs around 5-8c/kwh and is expected to be flattish to upwards in price going forward. In some places with subsidies it doesn't make sense to add fossil capacity anymore and with the 10% yearly cost cutting solar will be the cheapest unsubsidized option in most of the world in just a few years. The world's electricity demand is around 24000 twh today and expected to rise. That equates to a yearly solar demand of 267GW assuming solar will account for 50% of new capacity added and the lifetime of capacity is 30 years on average.

If you can't refute any of the numbers I have used then the only logical conclusion is that solar will grow a lot in the coming years (not 10%), and probably exceed 200GW/y in 2020, up from less than 60GW today.

Despite this incredible industry outlook, the industry leader, TSL, is trading at a 2015 P/S of .3 and a P/E of less than 5. TSLs market cap is less than $900M, compare that to the market cap of the industry leader of wind, Vestas, with around $12B in market cap. Solar is growing much, much faster than wind reaching about the same size this year when considering that 10 years ago, wind was more than an order of magnitude larger.

I think it's pretty safe to say that TSL is the best investment opportunity out there.

15-09-21,3lty6y,NESV - NEWS PR OUT!,"LAS VEGAS, NV (Marketwire – September 21, 2015 - National Energy Services, Inc. (the “Company”) (OTC: NESV) a growing oil and gas services company, would like to issue a statement regarding a proposed acquisition which was included in our recent filings to the SEC regarding the signing of an LOI with a Texas based Company operating in the Eagleford and Permian Basins. 

Although NES is excited about the opportunity for the anticipated closing of the acquisition, the Board of Directors adopted a policy this year not to announce any news about the agreements until they have conducted full due diligence and have finalized the purchase before announcing to the public. An LOI does not constitute an announcement until the transaction is complete. 

Robert Chance, President and Chief Executive Officer of NESV commented, “Over the past year, our team has been working diligently to identify and pursue acquisition opportunities of attractive companies with assets in the energy sector, and that mission has not changed given the challenges the industry has experienced this past year. 

The LOI which was include in our filings that was signed by both parties on March 24th, has advanced to closing stages, because of the speculation surrounding the filing of the LOI, given the number of communications NES has received on this particular target, felt a brief statement to shareholders was prudent. 

NES has completed all necessary due diligence on the target Companies, of which there are three consolidated into one, which involved a full appraisal of the assets to be included in the sale. Because of the size of the transaction, which is much larger than NES as the Company stands today, it has taken and enormous amount of time and capital to complete the pre-closing process, six months to be exact. 

Attorneys for both entities are working to finalize closing documentation to effect the transaction. Although we do not see any complications at this point which will hinder closing, wish to caution that the transaction is not complete and that this communication is only to advise our strategic partners and investors of where we are in the process. We hope to have further updates soon.”

I think and feel AMZN will do nothing but grow over the next year, because I work at a big box retailer, best buy, and I see BBY doing nothing to improve their online capabilities or improve our offerings, and I only see AMZN continually improve everything. Eventually you'll be able to buy phones on AMZN more easily and at a better deal than BBY with the way things are going.

Are there any sure shots you all thought were going to sky rocket only to result in a big loss?",2

I have some holdings.  A well diversified amount of household blue chip badass stocks.  Admittedly I invest on a, ""set it and forget it"" type mentality.  I have never sold anything I've ever bought.  I'm starting down the barrel at a decent half century of time before I can entertain the idea of retirement.  The thing is...I love dividends.  Albeit, at times a dividend I receive may only be .32¢ but I love getting them.  (Drip is all set up on every holding). 

My question to you fine folk...

I need something simple to show me when and how much I'll be getting in dividends for each holding.  For the love of all that is holy please don't just say - ""excel spreadsheet"" 

I'm not looking for an app either I suppose. I've downloaded billions of them and they all come back as junk.  

Does anyone know of a tool, database, spreadsheet, program I can attain that will show me or alert me that I'll be getting dividends ok whatever day and because I own X.XX shares it will be X amount?

It comes right after pizza and beer on Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

It might be really interesting (mostly as an experiment, nothing too serious) if we tried to do something like that here, specifically with the ratings reflecting a stock's yolo potential. This sub ~~is full of~~ has a decent number of intelligent people that actually know what they're doing, so I personally think some sort of consensus ratings would be *really interesting* to see. You know, like on a scale of 1-5, how many space yachts* do the WSB crew give AMDA?

Obviously, some degree of oversight would be needed (i.e. people would have to be invited to be able to rate, so that pumper accounts couldn't artificially drive up an average).

**Company Overview:**

Relypsa is a biotech company focused on developing and commercializing non-absorbed polymeric drugs to treat renal, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases. Their main drug in their pipeline is patiromer for oral suspension currently awaiting FDA approval with a PDUFA date of 10/21. Patiromer is a potassium binder that currently serves as a treatment for hyperkalemia (high potassium levels) in a chronic setting of mainly chronic kidney disease and/or heart failure.  

**Competition:**

Currently the only product approved by the FDA to treat hyperkalemia is sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS aka kayexalate). However kayexalate only serves as an episodic treatment mainly due to its lack of studies and side effects. In addition, patients can hardly tolerate more than several days on kayexalate.
Kayexalate is hardly a concern however.

The concern is ZSPH. ZSPH, with its drug ZS-9, currently has already filed a NDA with a PDUFA date of 5/26/16 also for the treatment of hyperkalemia. While the two drugs are different in composition and onset of action, they both achieve the same thing.

Which drug is better is also hard to decide due to lack of head-to-head comparison studies. However, I think Patiromer will have an advantage in being on the new market for half a year before ZS-9 releases.
Regardless, management believes Patiromer and ZS-9 will completely replace kayexalate, a poorly tolerated drug. 

**Distribution:**

RLYP will work with partners to target outpatient needs. They will distribute through specialty mail order distributors over retail pharmacy/hospital settings. Management strongly believes in this direction of distribution, reducing margin costs, allowing for next day delivery, and the ability to work directly with patient needs.

**Thoughts:**

Selloff of RLYP started from Aug 5, resulting in a 30% drop in share price. Selloff was mainly caused by increase in r&amp;d expenses and g&amp;a expenses. In addition, management claimed a need for additional funding or significant revenues to achieve profitability. This probably spooked investors. Stock is currently oversold based off RSI.

Currently RLYP has $299 million cash on hand and a debt of $16 million. In addition, RLYP will be rewarded $40 million upfront and $125 million after milestone sales from its partner VFMCRP after approval.

Currently insiders have majority ownership of RLYP (57%), and are not likely going to be bought out especially since ZSPH is under acquisition talks with Actelion. 
Float is 31.61m and shares short is 3.95m.

**Catalysts:**

* FDA Approval: This approval is extremely likely and is absolutely necessary for this company to obtain profitability. Looking at the studies and results, study end points were met and adverse effects were minimal. 
If FDA approval is met, stock should immediately increase to the current resistance levels of $23.35-25.39. In addition, Q3 or Q4 should begin to show small profits. In my opinion, profits should start ramping up Q4 and next year.

If FDA approval is not met, free fall may commence and I would short this stock to oblivion. 

**Risks:**

* FDA approval is likely already priced in. While I am confident that share price will go up upon approval, I think we can see an OPK/TSRO here where a less than expected gain results. And then a small decline, after short-term investors pull out.

* FDA Approval Failure.  With their partnerships lined up, studies already published in different medicine journals, and huge inside ownership, I think this is extremely unlikely. However WSB has taught me anything can happen so beware.

**Resources Used:**

* [Patiromer Study Article](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1410853#t=articleTop)
* [Company Website](http://investor.relypsa.com/releases.cfm)
* [Latest 10-Q](http://biz.yahoo.com/e/150806/rlyp10-q.html)
* [Hyperkalemia Info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperkalemia)

**Conclusion:**

This is a low risk one month hold in exchange for a small return on investment of around 10%. Although this stock does have the potential to skyrocket and analysts have a price target of $50 range, I don't think that will happen until revenue from sales come in. With the recent biotech decline, I would look for entry points at support levels close to $20.63 and $17.91 if it falls that far. If anything, I would definitely keep this stock on the lookout and see what happens to it.

**Disclosure:**
I have a small position in RLYP and will probably continue to dollar cost average until PDUFA date. In addition, because this post contains many forward-looking statements, please do your own DD before investing, especially since technical analysis is lacking here. Please correct me if you find any errors.

Oversold company with incoming PDUFA. Small Gainz. Probably not suited for the classic yoloer.",8

Do you really have to investigate all of the companies that make up the index? While it might not be the most sophisticated method, I can do some basic DCF analysis on individual stocks to see what the intrinsic value might be… any different tools one can use for analyzing these major indexes?

 I ask because I have a TSP which allows me to put my money in indexes that replicate the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, S&amp;P 500, DJIA and MSCI EAFE Index (I know TSP is limited in allocation selection…I only put in the 5% required to get the free 5% from my agency, all additional retirement savings goes into Vanguard funds). Most of my money tends to sit in the DJIA replicated index do to my age/risk level (28/high). I often take a look at TSP autotracker on the TSP talk website (http://www.tsptalk.com/tracker/tsp-tracker.php)  to see what others are doing (transactions are delayed because I dont have a premium subscription). I notice they tend to switch their allocations once or twice a month to the fund they think will outperform others. On a YTD basis, the top leaders are able to significantly outperform any one index, pretty consistently the three years I have been tracking it. Is there a method to their timing, or is it more luck?

15-09-23,3m3fyc,How is it that ETFs make money? (aside from capital appreciation),"I'm currently learning the ins-and-outs of investing 101. There has been an enormous amount of reading on my part. My research has helped me learn a lot of things I had no idea were a thing.

For instance, most people know that to make money on the stock market, one may use the ""buy low and sell high"" strategy. But I only just learned an alternative strategy, ""buy and hold"", to hang onto the stocks to receive dividends, which are the stock owners share of the business' profits. I am learning how to valuate the stock price based on the Earnings Per Share (Net Income) and the Book Value (Equity). So that is beginning to make some sense, and I like the direction Dividends is taking me.

Now I am trying to learn how dividends work with respect to Exchange Traded Funds. It's a little more confusing, probably because ETFs are bundled and there's more information involved per share.

For instance, on Schwab's site, for the ETF *Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth (SCHG)*, there is a table ""Dividends and Yields"". The values are:

* Next Dividend Payment: $0.1407

* Next Pay Date: Sept 25, 2015

* Previous Ex-Date: Sept 21, 2015

* Distribution Yield: 1.22%

* SEC Yield (30 Day): 1.07%


Farther Down, there is another set of data called Quarterly Total Return:

 * SCHG Market Price: 11.94%

 * SCHG Nav: 11.96%

 * Large Grown (Morningstar Category): 12.75%

 * DJ US TSM Large Cap Growth TR USD (12.04%)

Then, under the prospectus, under Summary Prospectus, I have found Annual Total Returns:

 * 2013: 33.96

 * 2012: 17.02

 * 2011: 0.67

 * 2010: 16.84


Finally, under the prospectus, under Annual Report, I have found Performance at a Glance:

 * Market Price Return: 25.14%

 * NAV Return: 25.16%

 * Dow Jones US Broad Market Stock Index: 24.74%

 * ETF Category Morningstar Large Blend: 23.09%


Questions I have: 

 1) Do all ETFs with stocks make dividends? Or do some not work that way?

 2) If not all ETFs make dividends, is there another way they make money, aside from capital appreciation? Is it possible to earn passive income from all ETFs?

 3) Does anyone know which numbers (from the above schwab example) are relevant to learning what dividends to expect from an ETF?

 4) Are ""ETF Dividend Funds"" supposed to generate *more* dividends for investors than other ETF funds? If not, then why are they called Dividend Funds? (ie, Scwab's Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF SCHD)",7

Looking for Volkswagen I found this (I trade at the London stack exchange): http://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/prices-and-markets/stocks/summary/company-summary/DE0007664005ZZEUREQS.html

The name of the stock is: 0P6N VOLKSWAGEN AG VOLKSWAGEN ORD SHS

Now I wonder what does all that mean? Why `0P6N`? Is that just a random, unique identifier for the stock? What about ORD and SHS?

And this is one of the less cryptic examples compared to what I find when searching through my broker. Is there any source where I can learn about that?

Currently that's still a general problem I have. I hear about company X and Y but often I have no idea which stock to get exactly because there's a huge number of cryptic looking names.

15-09-23,3m3z2k,Looking for opinions on investing strategy. Similar to swing trading?,"I just recently started investing on my own. I am a 25 year old male. I make roughly $75k/year. I own a duplex that I rent out. And I have no debt other than the duplex and a small car payment. With company matching I'm putting 7.5% of my salary into RRSPs. I'm going to be using another 7.5% of my salary into a TFSA to invest on my own. I've also kickstarted this account with an initial deposit of $15k. The goal of this account is to make at least 8% annually (hopefully north of 10%). I like to break things down into parts to make them seem more achievable. So breaking down the 8% annual yield goal to a per month figure you get around 0.667%. Thus meaning that every month I need to profit 0.667% in order to achieve my yearly goal of 8% +. I've been looking at a lot of big blue chip stocks. It seems to me that their price year over year does not change a ton (relatively), however there is lots of volatility hour-hour, day-day, week-week. I'm thinking that I will keep an eye on a few big stocks with sound financials and proven records and look for large drops in price (2-5% in a day). When these stocks drop I will investigate any news articles that may suggest why the drop occurred. If I can't find anything negative about the company published then I would buy stock and wait for it to return to it's normal level or higher and then sell. I would also set a hard stop if the stock kept going down (ie. sell the stock if it drops more than 2-5% or something). Obviously I wouldn't always be right, but as long as I was more often than not right it would be fairly easy to make the 0.667% every month. I have looked this up online and it sounds a bit like swing trading but not exactly. Does anybody employee this technique in their own accounts? I'm very excited to get trading.

Parkinson's affects a lot of people but not all patients experience the 'OFF' symptoms.

&gt; ""August, or the whole summer, may have shown that markets are riskier than we thought they were and that intense volatility is here to stay. If so, time alone won’t save your investment account.""

Volatility is here to stay..forever? Is that what the author is implying? For a millennial investor with decades left to go in the stock market I'm pretty sure the statement ""time alone won't save your investment"" is incorrect.

&gt; ""In the short run, big swings hurt investors because they make it hard to know when to cash out. If you need your money in the middle of a tumultuous period, you run the risk of selling when your investments have lost a lot of value.""

If you're over 50 this logic applies fine. If you're under 30, as is the target audience of this article - this is what an emergency savings fund is for.
 
&gt; ""Yes, investing over a long period of time lowers the odds you’ll end up in the red. But that doesn’t mean you’re safe. Ultimately, what matters is how much money you’ve accumulated when you retire, not how much you haven’t lost.""

What?

&gt; ""It’s true millennials may be more suited to having lots of stock exposure, but only because so much of their wealth is tied to their future wages""

And not because of compounding earnings?

&gt; ""Fortunately, it’s not too late. While an older investor doesn’t have much he can do about the markets today, a young one can try to develop strategies to mitigate risk and prepare for volatility.""

15-09-22,3lya9v,Well boys its been a good run.,"It indeed has been a good YOLO run. I shall give you a little detail for those who don't know me. When I was 16 my parents abandoned me so I was working full time while going to school and the only class I stayed awake for was DECA, so all the money I didn't need for bills I put into the stock market because I was an idiot 16 year old who obviously knew everything about the market after taking one class that had limited (very little) investing stuff.
Long story short between 2006-2008 I bought a bunch of mutual funds because I thought individual stocks were dumb unless you had a lot of money, then in 2009 I bought $5000 worth of SIRI at 5 cents and another $5000 of AIG at 5-6$ right after the collapse. I then started my own company while being a complete douche bag, because I was a self raised, self made 1%er at 19 years old. Then in my alcoholic doucheyness I commited a felony and lost everything. 

Fast forward to 2013. I get out of jail, and start bouncing around between construction jobs, getting raises along the way. Now it is 2015, and I have been getting sick of construction. So I take the money I have saved up for opening a new company. Put it in a brokerage, and decided to become a full time YOLO'er.

15-09-23,3m497x,NRA Investing in Vanguard ETFs from Mexico,"Hello!

I've actually gone through this process twice before and never actually done it. I finally took the plunge through a Mexican broker (which charges me .29% on every transaction) but I'm evaluating my options. I'd really appreciate if you guys could help me clear some questions:

1- The3 big ETFs (VTI, BND, VXUS) are listed in the Mexican Stock Exchange as Depositary Receipts and trade in $MXN. If I understand correctly, I’m pretty much holding the same assets but for some reason the low volume really concerns me [take a look at VXUS](http://finance.yahoo.com/q;_ylt=Albe3_PH5V.JtMIGI3JP0M5zAcAF;_ylc=X1MDMjE0MjQ3ODk0OARfcgMyBGZyA3VoM19maW5hbmNlX3dlYl9ncwRmcjIDc2EtZ3AEZ3ByaWQDBG5fZ3BzAzEEb3JpZ2luA2ZpbmFuY2UueWFob28uY29tBHBvcwMxBHBxc3RyAwRxdWVyeQNWWFVTLk1YLARzYWMDMQRzYW8DMQ--?p=http%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fq%3Fs%3DVXUS.MX%26ql%3D0&amp;uhb=uhb2&amp;fr=uh3_finance_vert_gs&amp;s=VXUS.MX) which has barely moved in a year, is that normal?), is this something I should be worry about?

2- **American Broker Taxes:** Mexico has a Tax Treaty with the US, only 10% would be withheld on dividends and none on capital gains. I'm still trying to figure out taxes on the Mexican side, it’s either an additional 0 or 10% on dividends and either 10% or 30% on capital gains. Does anyone know?

3- **Mexican Broker Taxes:** I know for certain that I'd only pay 10% on both dividends and capital gains. Does anyone know if even though they're listed in the Mexican Stock Exchange is the 10% on dividends from the US side still being withheld?

4- For NRAs, I've seen IB recommended over other brokers, why is this? I've looked a bit around and TD Ameritrade seems like a better option (I'd initially invest ~40k USD, not enough to offset the monthly $10 inactivty fee). In addition, I’d be able to trade the three big Vanguard ETFs commission free. Is there another benefit I’m overlooking? I’m not sure how much their currency exchange rates differ and I can't seem to find it online.

5- Do you know if I’d be getting taxed three times on an international ETF such as VXUS? (Once at the local market, one more in the US and a final one in Mexico?). Would this matter if my Broker was US or Mexico based?

6- I’d rather be invested in $USD than $MXN but given that these are depositary receipts, would I basically be holding $USD even if the ETFs trade in $MXN?

6- Said all this, am I over complicating things and should stick with the MSE or switch to a US based broker? I really need to clear up the tax issues, but if they were the same I can't see how staying with the Mexican broker is the better choice. I'd be paying currency conversion fees and wire transfers but that'd pretty much be it.",5

15-09-22,3lye7b,"New to trading, what strategies should I adopt?","So, I recently read the [""I'm drunk and I want to help you guys out cause I love this subreddit""](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3hhxhi/im_drunk_and_i_want_to_help_you_guys_out_cause_i/) post and the teachings from this great master now define my only strategy for trading. I believe it's working good, I think I still need to get the hang of it more. Since it's based completely on patterns I need to get the feel of it and adapt it to my own liking. I only trade stocks from the NYSE and NASDAQ, mainly because I am completely ignorant about any other trading. The only thing I don't like about the ""I'm drunk..."" strategy is that it works better the longer time lapse between buying and selling. So if you are willing to buy a stock and sell it in a year, it works perfect. In 5 days? maybe not so much.

15-09-22,3lyfls,NOL Vs DTA,"Question - since I have been reading up on NOLs - does anyone know the difference between an NOL and DTA? I asked my boss and he is smart, but maybe not his answer couldn't answer. Anyway this is interesting stuff on NOLS

http://www.valuewalk.com/2015/09/arquitos-capital-interview/

The focus on NOLs is a moment-in-time focus. I don’t know if the opportunity will be there five years from now. Certainly they won’t be as prevalent. The idea is to find hidden value. Where can I find opportunities that aren’t showing up on screens or that other investors aren’t seeing? There are these pockets of value in the market that are low-risk and potentially high reward. My challenge is to try to find those.

The focus isn’t on the value of the NOLs. I don’t think anyone can accurately value them. My focus is on the incentives that the NOLs provide. The NOLs attract investors, directors, and executives that are focused on effective capital allocation. They encourage thoughtful decision-making on internal investments. Many of these companies are initially valued on their balance sheet characteristics, and then, as they transition through an acquisition or corporate reorganization, other investors begin to value the company on its earnings power. This is how you can sometimes get significant gains.",2

15-09-23,3m4erk,Too early on my PWE YOLO,"Preface: Penn West Petroleum (US: PWE, TSX: PWT) is a very risky stock that is likely going to zero.

I'm now the not so proud owner of 156k shares of PWE at an average price of 57 cents per share.  They are a Canadian oil company that has been hit very hard by the fall in oil prices.  I had been watching the stock all year, but haven't really touched it until this month when I felt like the price drop made it too cheap to ignore.  Book value is over $7 per share, as was the stock price a year ago, and now it's trading at 47.5 cents.  The entire market capitalization of the company is under $250 million now, plus debt of around US $1.70 Billion for an enterprise value of under $2 billion.  They are aiming to keep their capital expenses to no more than their cash flow, but that doesn't help payoff debt.  To not drown under their debt they need either much higher oil prices, asset sales, or ideally a combination of both.

I view PWE as kind of a binary option.  Roughly speaking, there's a 50% chance it goes to zero, and a 50% chance it's worth $2+.  The market for the stock has been pushed down so much I don't think enough credit is being given to the upside.  In the unlikely event of a strong rebound in oil prices this stock could climb 1000%, but even much more modest improvements are way more than a double.  The easiest way to value the company would be the market prices they would receive if they sold all of their assets in the current market environment.

Last week they sold non-core assets with 4500 boe of production for CA $195 million ($147 million US), which is CA 43k/boe.  This leaves them with around 84k boe of production left, of which around 54k are their core assets and 30k are the less desirable non-core assets.  Much of the non-core would sell for a lot less than this, but averaged out with all of their core assets they could easily sell everything at the same multiple.  If you valued the entire company at that price (84k boe x 43k/boe) you get CA $3.6 billion, which is around $2.7 billion US.  Even that fire sale price leaves them with US $1 billion of cash after paying all debt, or around $2 per share. 

A better solution would be selling the rest of their non-core assets, hopefully into an upswing in oil prices so the market prices are better.  If they sold just their 30k boe of remaining non-core assets for around CA 33.3k/boe, which is 25% less than what they just received on their last sale, they could cut their debt in half.  They would then be left with a smaller but much nicer company with strong cash flows.  They would have 54k boe of core assets worth maybe 70k per boe, or around CA $3.8 billion less $1 billion in debt for net assets of CA $2.8 billion / US $2.1 billion.  That would be over $4 per share in value.

TLDR: PWE is a big gamble.  I think it's 50/50 worth $0 or $2+, but with it trading at under 50 cents that seems like a good bet to take.  I had hoped to buy in at the bottom of course, but I was at least a couple of weeks early.  On the plus side it goes ex-div next week and I'll collect 156 thousand Canadian pennies, although that will be the last dividend they pay.",3

The companies involved in the 1998 settlement didn’t admit wrongdoing. A Caterpillar official told the Chicago Tribune at the time that the company went along with the settlement to avoid litigation while a company spokeswoman denied that the company used any type of device to evade EPA tests.

In the 1998 case, the companies paid a combined $83.4 million in civil penalties, which was then the largest such fine for an environmental violation. They also agreed to spend $850 million to produce significantly cleaner engines and $109.5 million for additional environmental projects, including the development of new emission-control technologies.",1
15-09-22,3lythk,"I shorted a stock that went up 12,000% in one day","This was a few months ago but the trade is still open.  

Back in May an article came out that Tesla was buying a company called Riviera Tool. The stock RIVT went up from 0.005/sh to as much as around 0.60 per share - 12,000% gain.  I knew there was no chance acquisitions of public companies could happen at such multiples of the share price so I immediately started digging into the stock history.  My first thought was it was the wrong ticker symbol, somewhat like when Twitter was about to go public and the bankrupt company Tweeter's stock soared.

This turned out to be pretty much the same case here.  The company was correct, but the ticker was no longer affiliated with the company.  I found old stories from around 7 years prior showing that Riviera Tool went bankrupt and the assets were sold to a new private company.  All that happened was no one had gotten around to filing the paperwork to formally delist the stock and so it kept trading for years even though it no longer represented anything.

I first heard about the stock around 1pm that day and had things pretty much figured out within 15 minutes.  By then the price had dropped from 60 cents to 25 cents, but I knew it was actually worthless so I tried to short the stock.  I found shares available to be shorted on Interactive Brokers and shorted 10k shares for $0.25 each.  This was a relatively small trade, but I wanted to be somewhat careful as I knew it was always possible the stock could continue to explode higher for quite a while thanks to clueless traders and bandwagon jumpers.  Afterall I'd recently seen promotion stocks like LOTE and CYNK get billion dollar valuations despite having no assets, revenue, or even employees.  As it happens the stock just continued down pretty slowly over the next few hours and closed at .225.  Here is where it gets weird though.

At about 4:30pm an alert comes across that FINRA has halted the stock.  I pretty much declared victory at that moment because I knew the stock was worthless and FINRA would figure that out too and either cancel the shares or at least halt it for long enough for the dust to settle and let it reopen at .005 again.  However, that was May 7th and the stock is still halted.  It seems like a pretty cut and dry case so I have no idea what is taking them so long to take action.  Also, I've been paying borrow fees each and every day since.  Currently it's costing me about $4 a day to hold the position, but the rate fluctuates and it's been as much as double that some days.  Why the rate changes at all when no one can enter or close the position is a mystery to me, but it's a slow bleeding that has eroded much of the profit from the trade.  Even if it reopens at zero tomorrow I'll have paid about 1/3rd of the net proceeds in borrow fees, and if it stays halted for another 8 months or so I'll actually lose money on it even if it goes to zero.  

TLDR: Shorted a stock up 12,000% in a day.  It went to effectively zero three hours later.  I'm probably still going to lose money on it.  Be careful with your YOLOs - you can lose money in the most unexpected ways.",49

15-09-23,3m4iis,"Lets talk about buying a portfolio of all 3: VVUS, ARNA, OREX","Seriously, all three have great drugs. ARNA working on XR Belviq, OREX getting some yolalty payments, VVUS board rejected the extremely toxic Icahn deal (company might not go to zero). 

In general, the market mis-understands XR release platforms on drugs. I think XR Belviq should bump the ARNA pps by a nice 50% and then an acquisition could brew. Why? Lets look at ALZA and Concerta:

&gt;In 2001, ALZA was acquired by Johnson &amp; Johnson via a stock-for-stock transaction worth US$10.5 billion. 

Alza's osmotic release tablets are now the most prescribed forms of Methylphenidate on the market. In fact, the osmotic release concerta brand name owned by J&amp;J, generates more sales than the generic.


Then we got VVUS with boner pills and also weightloss. Yeah thats a crowded play with cialis and Viagra (/u/short_bonr). VVUS is the more longterm yolo with that huge fatty 217m debt on the book. Tranches due in 5 years or less.


Things get far better at OREX, better cash on hand, less yolodebt. Contrave is also compared to adderall so we get exposure to that market.

I seriously want to stick it in all 3 of these stocks after this whore-mouth Hillary and bloomberg stop throwing our yolotechs in the spotlight.

I have traded ARNA before and made 100% from the 2.5s to 5.25. I also shorted VVUS when the market didn't understand jack shit about Icahn's dealings.

15-09-23,3m27dn,New York Yankees legend Yogi Berra has died,"Here is 8 classic pieces of investing advice from Yankee legend Yogi Berra. 

**""If you don't know where you are going, you'll end up someplace else.""**
The idea here is that if you don't stay focused on your investing goals and stick to a plan, you're going to end up with a bunch of investments you didn't mean to make, and, most likely, a lot less money than you thought you'd have. 

**""We made too many wrong mistakes.""**
Mistakes happen, but it's the ones you make over and over again that will get you. The point here is that not every investment will work, but a well-diversified portfolio will smooth out the bumps over time. 

**""A nickel ain't worth a dime anymore.""**
The longer you invest, the more time you give your money to compound. Inflation will eat away at your purchasing power over a long timeframe, but consistent a investing plan will help you stay ahead of the curve. 

**""It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future.""**
Don't time the market: you'll get it wrong. 

**""In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But in practice, there is.""**
Everybody has a great idea until it comes time to use it, in investing and otherwise. 

**""90% of the game is half mental.""**
Markets take big swings and investing is hard. If you remain calm when times are tough and don't get too greedy when times are good, your investing goals have a higher chance of being met over the long term. 

**""If you can't imitate him, don't copy him.""**
If you're buying a strategy or investment product you don't understand, you're not going to get the most out of it. In fact, the opposite will probably happen: your plan will backfire. 

**""The future ain't what it used to be.""**
All investing advice and products come with the same disclaimer: ""Past performance is not a guarantee of future results."" Whatever happened in the past is unlikely to happen in the future, but a successful and smart investor will know this and be ready and willing to stick with their own well-thought-out plan in response.

http://www.feelingeurope.eu/Pages/Putin%20and%20GAzprom.html

Snips...

""In February 2008 the year the authors of this report, the independent expert issued a report to Putin. Summary, where presented their vision of the outcome of the activities and political heritage of the second President of the Russian Federation. 

The report Putin. Summary given the unflattering, but just based on facts and figures evaluation of the results of the work of Vladimir Putin, hidden from the eyes of Russians for molasses official propaganda, in various spheres of our life-economy, army, pension system, education and health, road infrastructure and other areas. 

However, many readers report rightly pointed out that there is a problem, which we touched on only part of the problem is the State of Russian energy in General and the issue of the country's main energy company, Gazprom, in particular. 

It happened for a reason. We believe that the situation with Gazprom requires a separate conversation that cannot fit into a couple of paragraphs. Firstly, because Gazprom and what is happening in this company has a very special significance for our country as a whole. 

Secondly, because of problems of Gazprom we know not by hearsay-in their professional activities we have for them is the most direct and immediate relevance, as a former fuel and Energy Minister and Deputy Minister of energy of Russia. 

Thirdly, because Gazprom has become a kind of special, personal project, Vladimir Putin, is from the outset of his presidency, he carefully took the company appointed to key posts in her close people, delved into details of her case. Gazprom is one of the few projects that Putin could be considered personally responsible almost from the outset of his reign, and that you can really judge the outcome of Putin. 

In this report we intend to build on the analysis undertaken in the report Putin. Results, and focus on what happened in those years, with Gazprom. If you want to know the truth about this-before you report ""Putin and Gazprom.""

This fact is important because under the affordable care act hospitals are penalized on re-admissions (IE failure to treat properly).   According [to the CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/heart-disease.htm) there are around 26 million people diagnosed with heart disease.   Of those 12 million see their doctors regularly.   And another 1.9 million required hospitalization on an out-patient basis and another 3.7 million required in-patient care at a hospital.   Note these are all fairly old figures ranging from 2007 to 2010 but its the best I have to work with, but we can assume with an aging baby boom population those figures have only increased but I’ll use the published numbers as my base-line.

Since some of BGMD’s detractors have argued that Gal-3 needs to be done in tandem with BNP tests, I will factor that in.  Since medicare pays the cost of a Gal-3 test, I’m assuming that as the test becomes widely available through Abbott Labs it will become standard to order a Gal-3 test along with a BNP test.  Medicare pays around $29 a test in all but two states where its closer to $20, but I am going to assume that BGMD makes a paltry $2 a test royalty and Abbott keeps the rest.  This is pure speculation since we do not have access to that data, thus I am keeping my figures extremely conservative.

For the purposes of valuation I am going to leave out HDL sales of the product as HDL was in extreme financial difficulty when they became BGMD’s customer, fell quickly into arrears and likely was not marketing the test (which is new technology) properly.   I am instead going to focus on the upcoming Abbott launch because Abbott has already started training and educating labs, physicians and hospitals on the value of the Gal 3 test.   I think it’s rather important to note that in the last conference and webinar Abbottt Labs is positioning Gal 3 as their own product and not as BGMD’s product.  Make of that what you will.

Using ONLY the 12m that see their doctors (and not the 26m diagnosed), I’m going to start assuming 3% of patients get a Gal 3 test in q3, 10% in q4, and 25% in q1 to allow for ramping up of education and availability.   Since the test is supposed to be administered every 4-6 months I’m going to leave 12m available each quarter. So for q3 we get revenues of 3% of 12m = 360,000 * $2 = $720,000.    For q4 we get 10% of 12m = 1,200,000 * 2 = $2,400,000.   For q1 we get 25% of 12m = 3,000,000 * 2 = $6,000,000.

Now things get interesting because the above numbers are base.   Because of the Affordable Care Act and hospital readmissions I’m going to calculate the top-side of the revenues using more aggressive ratios on hospitalization combined in and out patient at 5.6m.   I’ll divide that 5.6m by 4 averaging out the number of visits per quarter.    Again I’ll start low in q3 for ramp up and education at 5%  for $140,000, but 40% for q4 for $1,120,000 and 75% in q1 for $2,100,000.  The high ramp up to factor in the penalties hospitals face on re-admission.

Remember, BGMD has no debt and about $2m a quarter in expenses.  With this projected revenue stream (Base to (Base + Hospital testing)):

Q3: $360,000 - $500,000 (loss)

Q4: $2,400,000 - $3,520,000 (profitable)

Q1: $6,000,000 - $8,100,000 (very profitable)

These figures are for the US only and do not reflect international royalties which I expect to ramp up slower and is more of a next year catalyst than an immediate catalyst.  They do not include HDL’s numbers since it’s going through bankruptcy acquisition and I expect them to be a non-factor this year and into next.  The numbers do assume that since the patients are seeing their doctors that the tests are administered every six months or quarterly.

Remember there is projected growth after Q1 and the numbers I’m using are extremely conservative AND dated.   But if the ballpark numbers are close we can fix BGMD’s revenues for next year at a conservative $28,000,000 ($7,000,000 quarter).   Which should place the value of the company WITHOUT 2nd indication at $1.86/share.

The FDA 2nd indication is HUGE for BGMD because it allows the test to be used as a diagnostic test to TEST for the indication of heart disease in patients that do not have it, and could become a standard diagnostic test given to millions of otherwise healthy American’s to test for the possibility of heart disease in their future.   2nd indication would also solidify Gal-3 as an even more reliable test once heart disease has been diagnosed.

Assuming 2nd indication we can add another 50,000,000 tests (worldwide — conservative) a year administered to healthy individuals to test for heart disease risk adding another $100,000,000/yr revenue stream to the company.   With projected revenues of $128,000,000/year a conservative cash valuation for the company becomes $8.53/share.


**Disclosure** I am heavily vested in BGMD, thus the reason for this research because fair valuations help you identify undervalued as well as overvalued companies.

Also inspired by the VW diesel conspiracy to cheat emissions tests.

Let's say that someone independently discovered the VW cheat and immediately shorted a bulk of VW, because they KNEW it would get out eventually.  That knowledge is real and material information.  Is acting on it illegal?

What if the independent researcher above leaks the information themselves, 'causing' the drop?

I'm assuming the researchers on the VW case signed some NDA agreements.  Once they discovered the cheat, would it be illegal for them to act on it?

How about the engineers who designed the cheat themselves?

15-09-24,3m5rm3,"Market Manipulation and Stock Fraud Caused the August 24, 2015 “Flash Crash,” Just As It Did The Previous “Flash Crash” of May 6, 2010","On August 24, 2015, the Dow Jones Industrials plunged by almost 1100 points for a minute or so shortly after the open, at 9:35 a.m.  Never before in history had the Dow ever gone down over 1000 points in a single day, on an intraday basis or otherwise.  The S&amp;P 500 also briefly hit its intraday low at 9:35.  The Nasdaq Composite hit its intraday low at 9:32.
	The media have characterized this “flash-crash” as a freak occurrence due to almost universal panic-selling by millions of investors. It was no such thing.  Rather, as discussed below, it was-- just like the very similar “flash-crash” of May 6, 2010—market manipulation and fraud.  As in the case of the May 6, 2010 flash crash, the market manipulation and fraud on August 24, 2015 was undoubtedly due to illegal “quote-stuffing” by one or more “high-frequency traders” [“HFTs”]. 

The SEC investigated the “flash-crash” of May 6, 2010 and determined that it was caused by illegal “quote-stuffing” by an HFT named Navindar Singh Sarao.  Earlier this year, the U.S Department of Justice charged Sarao with 22 criminal counts, including market manipulation and fraud.  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Flash_Crash; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quote_stuffing.
The parallels between the May 6, 2010 “flash-crash” and the August 24, 2015 “flash-crash” are striking.  See zerohedge.com/news/2015-08-24/stunning-comparisons-between-flash-crash-august-24-2015-and-may-6-2010.  	In the May 6, 2010 crime, just as in the recent August 24 crime, many large-cap equities dropped precipitously, and then rebounded very rapidly.  In the May 6, 2010 crime, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, within minutes, plunged 998.5 points to its intraday low—the record up until that time—only to rebound sharply and recover most of the loss.  The August 24, 2015 “flash crash” had a greater DJIA point plunge, also within minutes, and a similar quick, sharp rebound recovering most of the loss.
The August 24, 2015 “flash crash” was actually more severe than its predecessor:  the various major market indices hit their limit down levels for the first time in history - not even during the Flash Crash of 2010 did this happen.

The media suggestion that the August 24, 2015 flash-crash was just caused by widespread panic-selling, based on the declines earlier that day in the Asian markets, is preposterous.  The largest decline in the Asian markets on August 24, 2015 was in the Chinese exchanges, which declined an average of between 8% and 8.5%.  Only two percent of the S&amp;P 500 revenues come from business in China.  It is utter nonsense to assert that the brief severe drop in the U.S. averages, and the sudden brief drop of many stocks and ETFs by more than 20% [and some between 35% and 50%]—can be explained solely by the earlier Chinese decline [which was between two and one-half and six times less than the U.S. decline].

The sudden drop in the U.S. stocks on August 24, minutes after market open, followed by the equally sudden surge in those stock prices (often within a minute or a few minutes of the stocks reaching their intraday lows), were patently the result of a massive market manipulation and fraud, just as was the case in the almost identical “flash-crash” of May 6, 2010.

Bond dividends: I don't understand. For example: I own $VGIT and $VCIT. Both of these intermediate bond funds at Vanguard pay me monthly dividends. But does the value of the ETF decrease by the amount of the dividend like it does with stocks? Or is the dividend actual payments to the bondholders, so is it an additional earning distinct from the appreciation/depreciation in value of the share price?

15-09-24,3m6hq1,Investment banking - worth doing for the experience and opportunities afterwards?,"Hi,

I am a graduate Finance student at the University of Amsterdam. I am trying to explore my career opportunities for after my studies. Investment banking is a topic that comes up often and I have seen it being associated with slavery, as the work is considered extremely exhaustive. I want bring value to this world and I feel like the role of banks is too focused on making money, and for this reason I don't see myself working in the banking sector forever. However, I have heard that having investment banking experience is extremely valuable and that it opens many doors for you.

An example: https://chc.tbe.taleo.net/chc01/ats/careers/requisition.jsp?org=TESLA&amp;cws=1&amp;rid=29791

'3 – 5 years’ of recent experience in an analyst role, preferable in the investment banking sector;'

What is it that makes this sector experience so valuable in for example a car industry like Tesla? And doesn't a financial analyst actually analyze more than an investment banker?

I would also like to know whether the role of a financial analyst is something that you see pretty much only in banks, or if it is also common in other companies. I don't see the term financial analyst mentioned for companies other than the Obvious banking/Insurance sectors. Business Analyst is a term I do see in other businesses, though, although this appears to be a completely different role that focuses more on making internal processes more efficient.

I consider myself ambitious and I am trying to forge a plan for after my studies. Even though I chose Finance, I am more interested in working my way up to a strategic position within a company, which I feel like might be more of a role for a marketeer. Tips for nice graduate finance jobs? I am especially interested in the technology sector and would really like to work for Google/Tesla in 5 years and grow from there

BMW AG fell as much as 9.3 percent in Frankfurt after a German magazine reported that the X3 xDrive 20d sport utility vehicle emitted as much as 11 times the European limit for air pollution in a road test, adding to concern that the investigation weighing on Volkswagen AG may spread to other manufacturers.

“There is no function to recognize emissions testing cycles at BMW,” the Munich-based company said in a statement in response to the report. “All emissions systems remain active outside the testing cycles.”

How do I get more investors without giving away the whole idea?","I have raised just over $100k- $10k of my own funds, the rest from friends/word of mouth.  My idea is such that by saying it in a sentence, it can be stolen.  NO ONE is doing it yet, and the profit margins are so incredibly massive, that everyone I present it to wants in.  I need about $200k to make it happen and am just over half way there.  The issue is that:

1.) Some investors are intrigued and want to know EVERYTHING about how it works once I show the initial pitch, and understandably so because this is a significant investment.  Is it normal/customary in the startup world to give away every single detail in order to raise the investment needed, at the risk of someone taking it for themselves?  This has already happened once, and now I have a previous potential investor trying to raise the capital on his own to compete.  Is there a way I can be professional, yet vague, and instill the same confidence, as if I had told them the whole inner workings?

NDA's don't seem to work well because someone can always just put the company in another name, their brother or associates name etc.. 

2.) Some investors want lifetime part ownership of the company, in exchange for their $50k.  
Should an investor really expect lifetime ownership of a company, and make millions over the lifetime of the company, just because they invested say $20k or $50k?

15-09-24,3m8zrk,New here - Activision Blizzard,"I don't know much about investing but back in 2011 a friend on World of Warcraft told me he's a day trader so his day is spent playing a video game on one monitor, and watching stocks on a second.

He told me if I had any money sitting in the back that I didn't need for some years, that I should put it into Activision Blizzard because with yearly expansions, Blizzcon, and new games coming (which they did) the value would only increase. The shares cost $10.50 at the time and I had $5k sitting in the bank ""saving"" even though I only made $8.50/hr so realistically I couldn't save to buy anything. 

Long story short, my parents talked me out of it saying $10.50 a share was too much and that people only made money off of &lt;$1 shares hoping they'd take off. I then got discouraged and said ""F"" the whole idea and completely quit looking into investing. I then blew the next 3+ years making my $8.50/hr while watching Blizzards value go up $1 at a time, never dropping. Three and a half years later (now) their value is at $31.50 and I'm kind of pissed off. My 5k in bank has made like 1-cent per year and it hurts knowing that if I had big money I could have tripled it in 3.5 years. No one in my family has a portfolio and is basically stuck working until they die, it kills me to see my future run the same course. 

Blizzard is coming out with a new game next year, a new expansion for WoW in 6 months, and Blizzcon is next month. I'd hate to buy shares at $31.50 now KNOWING what I should have paid for them years ago, but does anyone here with experience have an opinion? How likely is it for this companies shares to go up to $50, 60, 90+ each? I fear the ship has already sailed and I should find a new company to obsess over. I don't know where to look...I've followed Blizzard since early 2000s and knew they would succeed, so I wouldn't want to throw my money into companies blindly like I'm sure many new people do.

I can't afford to go to college or even get to a college. Have been walking to my minimum wage job for 10 years, and am too young to be rotting away without trying to succeed and learn something new. Where should I go from here?

I don't think ESPN will disappear off the face of the earth. People need sports just like they need news.

They can strike a deal with Netflix, offer a-la-carte options, etc. Yes everything is moving to a streaming/internet offering, but don't count ESPN out just yet. The current cable model is failing, but they will introduce themselves to a new market soon.

Volkswagen has hurt its ability to compete with Tesla in the future in two important ways. The first is the sheer cost of product liability in this case. So far, only the U.S. has taken action in this case, but VW has admitted that the software is present in 11 million diesel cars it has shipped throughout the world. Only 500,000 of those diesels have made it to the U.S. So the product liability is likely to be much worse.

Another side effect could be in the form of reduced sales and revenues as consumers turn away from VW brands because of mistrust. If a company is willing to cheat on a Federally mandated test, how might it cheat consumers in other ways?

""Most FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] participants, including myself, currently anticipate that achieving these conditions will likely entail an initial increase in the federal funds rate later this year, followed by a gradual pace of tightening thereafter. But if the economy surprises us, our judgments about appropriate monetary policy will change.""

My question is what does this mean for the markets tomorrow? 
Crazy selloff? Interest rates were bound to rise eventually.. so is this accounted for? Can no one really tell until it goes down?

15-09-24,3m7mga,I believe some form of continued easing will be hinted at today by Janet Yellen.,"If you look at the minutes from the latest Fed meeting you will see this line:

""The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.""

This line should have sent the markets soaring as it hints that a rate increase is highly unlikely in the foreseeable future.  However, we sold off instead.

I believe this line to be an indication that the FED does not believe the economy is strong enough to warrant a rate him this year or in the near future.  Furthermore, in coordination with Draghi, who recently hinted at further stimulus, I believe Janet Yellen will make a similar comment today when she speaks, about the FED standing ready to take further action if needed.   That alone will send markets rallying leading up to a GDP report tomorrow, which if strong, will continue the rally, and if weak, will spur further rumors of a new round of asset purchases.  Add to this fact that we just double bottomed the August 31st low and I believe we rally hard into the end of the year.  ",3

15-09-24,3m7nft,The Incredible Shrinking Alpha – What Was Once Alpha Is Now (Five-)Factor Beta? - Kitces,"[Link](https://www.kitces.com/blog/the-incredible-shrinking-alpha-what-was-once-alpha-is-now-five-factor-beta/)

tl;dr:

What was once believed to be alpha is increasingly turning out to be an active manager who simply invested to benefit from a not-yet-identified-as-such risk factor.

A growing base of research is raising the question of whether even the greatest investment managers in history were really active investing geniuses, or were simply rewarded for investing in and taking advantage of a unique form of risk factor that just hadn’t been identified as such at the time. 

In the process of adopting the three-factor model, though, Fama and French’s research indirectly explained the investment outperformance of many historically famous and successful investors. 

Favorable results that were once characterized as active manager alpha are, in the future, nothing more than factor-loading beta – and in the process, Swedroe and Berkin emphasize that the pool of available alpha has been dramatically reduced, and is continuing to shrink as more factors are added! 

Individual households – classically known as the “dumb” money against which the “smart money” institutions would trade to generate the biggest alpha – are forming a smaller and smaller share of direct equity ownership in the first place. Down to 20% in 2008. Professional fund managers are now mostly just competing against each other; it is estimated that as much as 90% of daily trading is simply institutional investors.  Even the most amazing investor in history will have trouble outperforming when his/her competition are other investors who are also better than anyone else in history: The Paradox of Skill.

David Hsieh once estimated the total amount of alpha on the table for hedge funds is about $30B per year;  in today’s environment, with a $3T+ hedge fund industry, that pool of alpha may be down to only 1%/year.

Investors would be better off simply trying to invest passively at the lowest feasible cost to capture as much as the factor-based beta as they are comfortable (given risk tolerance), i.e. to construct passive portfolios, not based on indices but designed specifically to maximize (or at least optimize based on risk tolerance) the exposure to those factors. Inclusion of “all” stocks in the index may not only fail to overweight “favorable” factors, but will fail to underweight known-to-be-unfavorable factors.


Any one factor in particular may go in and out of favor over time,  investment strategies that rotate in and out amongst factors may still have an opportunity to generate alpha.  Owning the “right” factor at the “right” time can be more valuable than just owning a diversified portfolio of all of them. Of course, the notable caveat is that thus far, such “tactical” or “dynamic” asset allocation strategies haven’t had a great track record.",2

15-09-25,3mdv3k,My problem with dividends (rant),"Yesterday before bed I checked on the current state of my Vanguard index funds (International Developed, Emerging Markets, US Large Cap, US Small Cap, etc). I saw they had dropped by 1% or more, but I hadn't heard any news of such a drop in the SP500 on the news.

I went over to the respective ETFs (VEA, VWO, VV, VB) and saw they had dropped by just 0.2% that day. What gives? Suddenly I realized it was *dividend day*. Sure enough, this morning Vanguard purchased a new chunk of shares for me in these accounts. The drop from the day before was because dividends cause the share prices to drop by the amount of the dividend.

I'm tired of dividends. All they are is me being *forced* to sell and then rebuy a sizable portion of my account (from 2% of US Large Caps to 3% of Emerging Markets). Pure inefficiency. And then I have to pay taxes on this dividend at the end of the year. Yes, some of the funds probably have qualified dividends with 20% tax rates or whatever, but many probably don't, and I'll be taxed 35% on sold shares that I could held for a long time (and eventually paid 15% on).

When I began investing, people talked about dividends like they were this fun thing that happened on occasion through the year. Like a paycheck or a tax return -- something to look forward to. But here I am, finally serious about my investing process, and I realize they are nothing but the forced selling and rebuying of shares in my account. Nothing more. They don't give me more money. They don't do anything except increase my taxes.

Don't think these taxes matter? Try taking a six figure retirement account and compound a 5% tax difference (20% qualified dividend vs. 15% long term capital gains) over a period of *40 years*. The final dollar figure will be huge! Reverse the magic of compound interest and you get the tyranny of compounding fees. I worked so hard to find funds with low expense ratios for this very reason.

I suppose reinvesting dividends is simply the system I have to work with. But I don't have to like it.",0

The above withdraws happened because I ended up needing the money to pay for an unexpected (but highly desired) career change.

My question is how do I go about calculating the return going forward?  My first thought was my current cost basis is $418.83 (deposit - withdraw) going forward then as I add more money increase cost basis, however my current portfolio is 3X my current cost basis which is absurd of course as a return and clearly wrong.  On the other hand, if I use (deposit/(withdraw + portfolio))/time then future returns will not be accurate as the return on my withdraws is not going to increase and each year the return on those withdraws stays the same over a longer time period making my returns look worse than they are.

I know that normally you look at what returns would have given the final balance to find the annualized return, but the issue I guess is that I do not know if I use cost basis, only deposits, if I offset the ending balance by withdraws (which ignores that those withdraws will have zero growth after they were taken out), or how I take into account that I have withdraws already and will still be investing for a long time and will have many more contributions...",3

15-09-25,3me8l7,Ive got to apologize to all the biotech investors,"So after years of thinking about it(I owned a 1st generation ipod), I finally convinced my wife to let me invest in apple in September 2012. If you'll look at the charts, you'll see that this is the month it began it big decline...

I hung on for a while but after a month, embarrassed, frustrated and angry,  I closed my position and swore to never in invest in stocks. 

Several years later, seeing that Apple had climbed to new highs and that my initial analysis of Apple had been correct, I decided to exam the market again. 

Instead of investing in a single stock, I decided to invest in a whole sector and I settled on the biotech sector. I pulled the plug and opened a position in May of this year. 

From the bottom of my heart, I am so sorry for the pain that I've caused everyone over the last few months. 

I know I should close my position so that the market can go back up but it's so...soul-crushing to fail again. For a few briefs weeks in July I felt hope, that maybe I wasn't so dumb after all. But now the cold truth haunts my thoughts. I'm just a monkey trying to solve calculus.

I will close my position on Monday and end the subscriptions to all my financial news sources. Biotech, the stock market, the US economy and shortly thereafter, the world economy, will improve and rise to heights only dreamed of by the most bullish of investors.

15-09-27,3mj7bo,"Can someone please explain the calculation in this excerpt from ""The Warren Buffet Way""?","A bit of context first. This is an excerpt on the calculation of Coca Cola's value in 1988 assuming a 15% annual growth on owner earnings for 10 years and 5% afterwards, using John Burr Williams' dividend discount model. 

&gt;In 1988, owner earnings of Coca-Cola equaled $828 million. The
thirty-year U.S. Treasury Bond (the risk-free rate) at that time traded
near a 9 percent yield. So Coca-Cola’s 1988 owner earnings, discounted
by 9 percent, would produce an intrinsic value of $9.2 billion. When
Buffett purchased Coca-Cola, the market value was $14.8 billion, 60
percent higher, which led some observers to think he had overpaid. But
$9.2 billion represents the discounted value of Coca-Cola’s thencurrent
owner earnings. If Buffett was willing to pay the higher price,
it had to be because he perceived that part of the value of Coca-Cola
was its future growth opportunities.
When a company is able to grow owner earnings without additional
capital, **it is appropriate to discount owner earnings by the difference
between the risk-free rate of return and the expected growth of
owner earnings.** Analyzing Coca-Cola, we find that owner earnings
from 1981 through 1988 grew at a 17.8 percent annual rate—faster
than the risk-free rate of return. When this occurs, analysts use a twostage
discount model. This model is a way of calculating future earnings
when a company has extraordinary growth for a certain number of
years and then a period of constant growth at a slower rate.
We can use this two-stage process to calculate the 1988 present
value of the company’s future cash flows (see Table 8.1). First, assume
that starting in 1988, Coca-Cola would be able to grow owner earnings
at 15 percent per year for ten years. This is a reasonable assumption,
since that rate is lower than the company’s previous seven-year average.
By the tenth year, the $828 million owner earnings that we started
with would have increased to $3.349 billion. Let’s further assume that
starting in the eleventh year, growth rate will slow to 5 percent a year.
Using a discount rate of 9 percent (the long-term bond rate at the
time), we can back-calculate the intrinsic value of Coca-Cola in 1988:
$48.377 billion (see Notes section at the end of this book for details of
this calculation).5 
  

The footnote being:
&gt; The first stage applies 15 percent annual growth for ten years, starting in
1988. In year one, 1988, owner earnings were $828 million; by year ten,
they will be [$3.349 billion]. Starting with year eleven, growth will slow to 5
percent per year, the second stage. In year eleven, owner earnings will equal
$3.516 billion ($3.349 billion × 5 percent + $3.349 billion). **Now, we can
subtract this 5 percent growth rate from the risk-free rate of return (9 percent)
and reach a capitalization rate of 4 percent.** The discounted value of a
company with $3.516 billion in owner earnings capitalized at 4 percent is
$87.9 billion. Since this value, $87.9 billion, is the discounted value of CocaCola’s
owner earnings in year eleven, we next have to discount this future
value by the discount factor at the end of year ten [1/(1+.09)10] = .4224. The
present value of the residual value of Coca-Cola in year ten is $37.129 billion.
The value of Coca-Cola then equals its residual value ($37.129 billion)
plus the sum of the present value of cash flows during this period ($11.248
billion), for a total of $48.377 billion.

I'm having trouble fully wrapping my head around this. The way I understand it, $828 million has an intrinsic discounted value of $9.2 billion dollars, because given the ""risk free"" bond's rate $9.2 billion dollars would be required to produce $828 million in interest. Thus any price below this benchmark would indicate that this company is a value purchase.  

What I don't understand is the footnotes. It mentions a 5% growth on owner's earnings being subtracted from the risk free rate to perform the calculation, but why do we do this? Using only 4%, the calculated intrinsic value comes to $87.9 billion for year 11. But at a 9% risk free rate, one could produce $7.911 billion from such an investment. How does this match up with the $3.516 billion in owner's earnings produced in year 11 (keep in mind this is *after* the 5% annual growth is applied)?  

What am I missing here?  

(I also don't understand the application of the equation [1/(1+.09)10]. Although this is probably something I can figure out on my own once I get past the confusion that is above).

CROIC is a variation that focuses on cash return on invested capital. It's also labeled as CROCI (cash return on capital invested).

CROIC = FCF/Invested Capital

Invested Capital = Shareholders Equity + Interest Bearing Debt + Short Term Debt + Long-Term Debt

Basically, it shows how well management is generating cash returns from the capital it's investing.

Any stock that can consistently maintain a number over 13% is a strong indication of a moat.

what do you guys think? If nothing else its due for a dead cat bounce right?

Hello! I'm 27 making roughly 110k a year, my wife and I have been able to live quite comfortably on my salary  alone. We have no outstanding student debt, no car payments but we do have a hefty mortgage (430k). My wife has recently started working again and is making about 3k a month after taxes, and since we're so accustomed to living on my salary alone we've decided to save/invest the majority of her income. Initially a lot of it will go towards house renovations, but what should we do after? I'm conflicted between using it for max payments against the principal of my mortgage or investing it. With mortgage rates so low, investing might be the wiser choice. Our retirement is mostly handled, when I retire from my job I'll receive a 66-70% pension (depending on years worked.) Knowing that, I feel like now is a good time to take risks - especially since we don't have kids. I apologise if this should have gone into a daily thread of some kind, but I saw the other gentleman requesting advice and figured I would try the same.

If cramer hypes it, it is going to shit.  

Realistically though, I am still balls deep in this stock.  Part of me wants to see it hit 7.5 before it makes a mad comeback so I can average down harder and add to my shares.  Would give me a good time to excercise my 10.5 Oct 15 puts too.  Profit on puts = MORE SHARES.

To comfort anyone else holding them right now, when they dropped below 9, the bid on those same puts was .78.  Think about that.  No one even wanted to bid over a dollar for a put who's fucking intrinsic value at the time was over 1.5, with 2 weeks left and downward momentum.  Even with biotech in the shitter, the puts I am holding look like turd sandwhiches.

We are coming back some kind of crazy.  Nothing has changed.  I realize we all do a lot of short term yolo plays, but to my OPK holders here, I will see you fuckers at 18 a share by end of 2016.

15-09-27,3mm3sm,Google Finance Stock Screener Output to Spreadsheet?,"I need to do some basic data analysis on the output of the Google Finance stock screener.  Basically, I like to look at dividend payout ratio, which means dividends (per share) divided by earnings (per share).  I do an initial screen of companies with positive earnings and positive dividends, and then after that I like to look at payout ratio.  To do that it make sense to put the data in a spreadsheet.  I'll be happy to elaborate on why I like to look at this if anyone cares, but here's my issue...

I have tried with Excel, Google spreadsheet, and WPS spreadsheet.  In my hands none of them recognize the output of the Google Finance Stock Screener as a table they can download.  

If anyone remembers the old Yahoo Java stock screener, it was imperfect, but would output data to a spread sheet.

I realize in advance that I may be asking a stupid question, or one dealt with before, but does anyone have a method of auto-outputting the results of a Google Finance screen as CSV or any spreadsheet format?

CLARIFICATION - here's an example stock screen using Google Finance.  It's a nice tool, and returns over 5000 stocks with this example screen. http://imgur.com/gallery/d0JlGqo/new

What I'd like to do is export the results of this screen into a spread sheet - the selected data on all 5000 stocks - so that I can so some extra things that you can't screen for in Google Finance (such as screen for payout ratio, as I mentioned above).

If First Eagle Investment Management is only the start of the commission’s crackdown on fund companies’ hidden fees, who's the next? 


&gt; On Sept. 21, the SEC’s enforcement division filed proceedings against First Eagle Investment Management, an asset-management company overseeing $100 billion. From January 2008 through March 2014, First Eagle improperly billed its investors $25 million for payments to brokers marketing the funds’ shares. The commission also accused First Eagle of misleading investors by maintaining in fund documents during that period that it was paying the marketing costs itself.

&gt;First Eagle settled the matter without confirming or denying the allegations. It agreed to pay about $27 million in disgorgement and interest as well as penalties of $12.5 million. The S.E.C. will set up a fund to return money to investors who were harmed by First Eagle’s actions.

&gt;However, that the First Eagle case may be just the initial S.E.C. salvo on improper mutual fund fee practices. Tricks involving 12b-1 fees are a rich vein for the S.E.C. to mine because these charges are exceedingly opaque. Bringing cases in this area is crucial for investors since these fees drag down fund returns.",207

In bears, we should start looking at a higher percentage of stocks with high, safe dividends. Here are a few blue chips worth thinking about. Feel free to argue with me or add to the list.

GM ~30/share ~4.9% div yield.

GM has the cash flow and debt (thanks to the taxpayers) ratios to support the dividend through a sustained bear market. I expect the share price to be moderately steady.

KO (Coke) share price ~40/share with a ~3.3% div yield. Coke is a remarkably stable company with an extremely strong dividend history. 

XOM (Exon Mobil) ~73/share ~4% yield. Exon has a roughly 4 billion free quarterly cash flow. Exon has planned stock buybacks and a strong dividend. If oil crashes further, the buyback will be dumped way before the dividend. There is also some (LONG horizon) stock price upside involved too. 

WFC (Wells Fargo) ~51.50/share ~2.9% div yield. 

Wells Fargo has a smaller exposure to foreign markets than most of the other mega US banks. If the FED does raise rates, it should boost the share price a bit too.

I admit I had to buy the short side of a calendar back due to this at slight loss today, didn't expect to see rule proposals coming out in an already volatile market but hey, govt fucks.  What can ya do?

Here's the gist...

&gt; The proposed rules come amid a steady drumbeat of questions about whether bond funds will be able to handle massive withdrawals. For instance, The Wall Street Journal recently reported that some of the largest U.S. bond mutual funds have 15% or more of their money invested in hard-to-trade securities.

My bets on this are HYG and EMB, opened puts on them for January during the late August dead cat bounce.  HYG is in the money as of today.  Still a few bucks out on EMB but it's looking up, Turkey got a downgrade from Moody's today and Brazil is all over the news talking about default so it's a matter of time on that.

If you all remember 2008, it was as less a valuation problem than it was a credit problem that broke the camel's back.  This scenario is no different.  Money has flowed like water from domestic mortgage bonds (obvious reasons) to junk and small country debt to find yield in the past few years.

tl;dr:  The fed isn't just holding your fate, or biotech's fate, or oil's fate, or US banks' fates in their hands.  They're holding the fate of the entire world in their hands, whether they choose to acknowledge it or not.  And ""nothing"" clearly isn't fixing it anymore.  Their ""nothing"" from September has gotten us right back down to August lows.  Treasury yields are rising anyway.  Junk debt is collapsing anyway.  The U.S. Govt clearly has no concept of this, else they wouldn't be publishing rule changes on an already fragile market.",4

15-09-27,3mlmjw,529 College Savings Plan (x-post from /r/mommit),"Hi /r/investing, 

This is Lauren Min and Lawrence Williams, two researchers at the
University of Colorado at Boulder. We would like your help with a
research study on college savings. For our research, we are recruiting
people who are interested in opening a 529 College Savings Plan but have not done so yet. We will ask you a few questions, and ask you to visit the website of a well known financial institution to learn more about their 529 plan.

For participating in our research, you will be entered into a raffle
for a $25 Amazon e-gift card. Our survey should take 5-10 minutes, plus any time you decide to spend on the external 529 website--how long you spend on that website will be up to you. The odds of winning will be 1 in 50, or better. 

Unfortunately, our budget is not unlimited. Once we reach 300 started
surveys, the survey link will deactivate. We will update this post to
let you know when the study is dead. Winners will be notified within
24 hours after we close the study. At the end of the survey, we will redirect you to a different survey (to preserve anonymity) in which we will ask for your e-mail address. If you are a winner, we will e-mail you with details on redeeming your e-gift card.

We ask that you only take this survey if you meet the following criteria:

1. You are over the age of 18.
2. You are a parent to a child 3 years old or younger.
3. You have some interest in opening a 529 College Savings Plan but have not done so yet.

While a BP or other shale company might be under pressure right now and could cut their dividends, the CEOs of Exxon, Chevron, and Shell have come out on record and announced their plans to not cut dividend. Exxon, Chevron, and Shell haven't cut their dividends since World War 2- the dividend was untouched through the 2008 financial crisis and through the 80s (featuring $10 oil). They are also well-diversified in the downstream refining areas, which make money when oil prices are low.

15-09-29,3mruwe,NOL shells,"Guys, three ideas that will get you one step closer to buying that yacht (or second yacht). These ideas have been written up a couple places before y different people, but they are actionable now more than ever.

1. **WMI Holdings ($WMIH):** Shell company with $6bn in NOLs (and a runoff reinsurance biz that no one cares about). Used to be WaMu. KKR essentially controls the company as the major holder of convertible preferred and warrants and is looking to make an acquisition to monetize the NOLs. Company must make an acquisition by sometime in 2018 (date of preferred liquidation). Just listed on Nasdaq today after trading OTC forever.

2. **Sycamore Networks ($SCMR):** Another shell with $850mn of NOLs. Board voted to liquidate, but some BSD activists went yolo and are trying to stop the liquidation and the turn the company into an acquisition vehicle to monetize the NOLs. 30% downside to liquidation value, but potential 10x+ upside if the activists win.

3. **Real Industry ($RELY):** An NOL shell that already made its first acquisition (an aluminum recycler) with $934mn of NOLs. There is still tons of upside with this name, but I mainly included it to give color on what the other two companies could become.

I don't believe myself to be a great investor by any means (I still have much to learn); my portfolio consists of roughly 50% is in index funds spy and VOO, 20% in bonds, the other 30% I choose my own stocks (my other investments are FIZZ, KHC, T, and TSM).

I believe this company to be slightly undervalued and has a lot of price appreciation especially once people start buying again. Currently revenue is slipping so because of this the company has already dropped 20% in recent memory; however, the company has been buying back shares to keep up EPS. I know sometimes companies do this to hide certain things (like sales slipping) but its good for shareholders (for the most part; this can be argued otherwise). Ticker is $BBBY

1.) For one, it showed up on my stock screener which has the following criteria: 

*Market Gap &gt;$5B
*Return on Assets (ROA) &gt; 10%, 
*5 Year Avg Return on Equity 10%+
*Free Cash Flow $500k+
*EBITDA&gt;$300 Million
*Price/Earnings Ratio &lt;20
*Current Ratio 1 to 2 and 2 to 3
*Revenue Growth 5 Year Avg 5-20%

2.) I did a Discounted Cash Flow Analysis which showed $BBBY to be worth $67.61. Currently the stock price is showing a 11.56% discount. I like to use really really conservative estimates. The website Gurufocus.com has a DCF of $113.98 for $BBBY.

Some small details about my DCF analysis: I came up with a WACC of 6.75%, a terminal value of $13,053,935,000.56 ($13.05 Billion), and I used a terminal growth rate of 2%. 

3.) The company has a strong cash position of $4.22 a share in its most recent quarter; this represents 7.05% of its current stock price of $59.79.

Happy Hunting 
J


Hedging is often considered an advanced investing strategy, but the principles of hedging are fairly simple. With the popularity - and accompanying criticism - of hedge funds, the practice of hedging is becoming more widespread. Despite this, it is still not widely understood.

Everyday Hedges
Most people have, whether they know it or not, engaged in hedging. For example, when you take out insurance to minimize the risk that an injury will erase your income, or you buy life insurance to support your family in the case of your death, this is a hedge.

You pay money in monthly sums for the coverage provided by an insurance company. Although the textbook definition of hedging is an investment taken out to limit the risk of another investment, insurance is an example of a real-world hedge.

Hedging by the Book
Hedging, in the Wall Street sense of the word, is best illustrated by example.

Imagine that you want to invest in the budding industry of bungee cord manufacturing. You know of a company called Plummet that is revolutionizing the materials and designs to make cords that are twice as good as its nearest competitor, Drop, so you think that Plummet's share value will rise over the next month.

Unfortunately, the bungee cord manufacturing industry is always susceptible to sudden changes in regulations and safety standards, meaning it is quite volatile. This is called industry risk. Despite this, you believe in this company and you just want to find a way to reduce the industry risk. In this case, you are going to hedge by going long on Plummet while shorting its competitor, Drop. The value of the shares involved will be $1,000 for each company.

If the industry as a whole goes up, you make a profit on Plummet, but lose on Drop - hopefully for a modest overall gain. If the industry takes a hit, for example if someone dies bungee jumping, you lose money on Plummet but make money on Drop.

Basically, your overall profit, the profit from going long on Plummet, is minimized in favor of less industry risk. This is sometimes called a pairs trade and it helps investors gain a foothold in volatile industries or find companies in sectors that have some kind of systematic risk.

Expansion
Hedging has grown to encompass all areas of finance and business. For example, a corporation may choose to build a factory in another country that it exports its product to in order to hedge against currency risk. An investor can hedge his or her long position with put options or a short seller can hedge a position though call options. Futures contracts and other derivatives can be hedged with synthetic instruments.

Basically, every investment has some form of a hedge. Besides protecting an investor from various types of risk, it is believed that hedging makes the market run more efficiently.

One clear example of this is when an investor purchases put options on a stock to minimize downside risk. Suppose that an investor has 100 shares in a company and that the company's stock has made a strong move from $25 to $50 over the last year. The investor still likes the stock and its prospects looking forward, but is concerned about the correction that could accompany such a strong move.

Instead of selling the shares, the investor can buy a single put option, which gives him or her the right to sell 100 shares of the company at the exercise price before the expiry date. If the investor buys the put option with an exercise price of $50 and an expiry day three months in the future, he or she will be able to guarantee a sale price of $50 no matter what happens to the stock over the next three months. The investor simply pays the option premium, which essentially provides some insurance from downside risk.

The Bottom Line
Hedging is often unfairly confused with hedge funds. Hedging, whether in your portfolio, your business or anywhere else, is about decreasing or transferring risk. Hedging is a valid strategy that can help protect your portfolio, home and business from uncertainty.

As with any risk/reward tradeoff, hedging results in lower returns than if you ""bet the farm"" on a volatile investment, but it also lowers the risk of losing your shirt. Many hedge funds, by contrast, take on the risk that people want to transfer away. By taking on this additional risk, they hope to benefit from the accompanying rewards.

Last year, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus sold 10 million units in their opening weekend, though that number excludes sales in China, where around 3 million units were sold in their first weekend. 

All together, sales remain roughly the same year-over-year, though some analysts view it as a good sign.

15-09-29,3mskpm,$VAPE bounce/pincher play (OTC),"Sup guys. 

I'm currently eyeing Vape Holding, Inc (VAPE) for a large bounce in the next couple days.

Annotated Chart: http://imgur.com/wXK91lY

Reasons:

- RSI is extremely oversold. The stock has a history of bouncing hard after reaching extreme oversold territory. This excessive selling cannot go on forever (well, it definitely can, but not at the rate this stocks been going at).  

- Pincher set-up in effect. For anyone who doesn't know, a pincher play is a setup where the PPO and ADX Line indicators start coming together (pinching) during a large downtrend. It indicates a bounce and once the upward movement starts, the 2 indicators unpinch and start moving in opposite directions again. For anyone who uses TA, this can be a useful play. For those who don't, ignore this bullet point.

- Low float : can move quickly on a lower amount of shares.

Overall, this seems to be one to watch in the next few days. I'm not rushing to get an entry point, as it very well might continue downward. Plus, there has been some dilution with note-conversions recently (in recent 8-k).

But any large momentum/pattern shift can see this fly multi-day.

However, ABTL is just internet car-selling websites, they are middle-men, not tied to any particular brand and without any possible hand in emissions cheating. All they care about is churn--is this scandal really enough to decrease that churn?  

Depending on how this emissions stuff plays out, and how much other companies are revealed to have cheated, any one car manufacturer could get screwed. ABTL doesn't seem to face the same threat, yet it's SP has tanked with the rest of the industry (it is now commensurate with the pre-ER beat level). Any thoughts on why?

15-09-29,3mszi3,Thoughts on using downturn to bolster and protect a current long position.,"Like many, the last couple of trading days have hurt a few of my positions pretty badly, but I am not panicking hard. All my big accounts are professionally managed, and the tiny one I am using to learn trading for myself is more or less expendable (I'd yell if I lost it all but forget about it by happy hour).  A lot of reading and thinking has gone into this learning process, but I recently had a thought that I can't really search for and would like some clarification on.

I'm all in favor of holding as opposed to accepting a loss and selling.  Given this, if I'm convinced I like a company long enough to hold it into the money even though there is a fair chance of losing (i'm pretty risk tolerant), does it make sense to buy more of the same shares during the slump to drive down the average purchase price of the holding?

An example from my portfolio: I originally bought RAD at $8.50, which closed Monday at $6.20.  If I was to put in for an additional number of shares equal to 80% of my initial purchase (a number derived by an amount I am comfortable converting cash to), it drives my average breakeven price (after round trip commissions) to $7.80/share.  My prevailing thought is that a level of protection is offered as price has far less to rebound before you can dump the whole position near breaking even if you have to, but you also see a higher return by selling at your target if it is ever reached in the future.  

Feel free to say something about that particular ticker, but I'm interested in knowing how far off I am on this thought.  Is it something viable, or is the move to always use additional funds to diversify when everything across the board is cheaper?  ",2

First time poster in this subreddit. Please dont kill me!

A bit of background. I am 24 years old. 18k in student debt. 5k car loan. 4k combined in my checking and saving. I earn about 30k a year after taxes. My student loan debt is increasing at 4.5% and my car loan is 1%. 

I recently came across $3,000 dollars that I could use however I wanted. I could put it in my checking or savings or apply it to the only two debts that I had mentioned above. I decided that I would try to have my money make money for me. I didnt really want to do any work though and I decided that putting my money in a stock and letting it sit for a couple of years would be fine with me. 

This was my first time buying stocks. I had done a bit of research but I am sure not enough.

On 6/22/15 I purchased $1500 worth of RAD. 

The stock went down a bit, and on 7/02/15 I purchased another $1500 of RAD.

Since the 6/22/15, I have lost around 27% or almost $800. 

Should I just sell now and take the hit or should I just leave my money there ""for a couple of years""?

15-09-29,3mwg09,Trailing stop orders with TD Ameritrade round to .01,"Essentially if you buy stock below a penny your trailing stop order will kick you at at the next price closest to a penny. Eg the next number up.

Yesterday I bought 90k of ACOL @ .0024 and placed a trailing stop at a mark price of .0005 As soon as I was executed my trailing stop *(WHICH ACTUALLY ROUNDED TO .01)*got me out at the next closest price to .01. So my stop immediately closed my entire position @.0025. The market closes and I'm left to find out I have no position. And today when I see that shit up over %40 I'm fucking livid. 
I try again and pick up 55k @.0035. I decide to give the t/s another go, and put my stop a little wider even. Sure as shit I'm closed out @.0036! In immense frustration call trade support and the guy takes no responsibility for the bad execution and blames OTC unregulated market makers for manipulating the price calling pennystocks the ""Wild West"". *I chuckled*. 
Meanwhile I'm being pinged on my phone from chat support, and the price is @.0047, so I thank the guy and hop on the chat. 
Chat guy sees my trailing stop order on his screen and soon explain that my t/s order rounded up to a penny. He asks that as long as I agree to not place anymore trailing stop orders below .01 he will rescind the sell order @ .0036 and place 55k shares back into my account.

I still have a great deal of confidence in healthcare and the advances that many companies are making. However, I knew that they were going to go after the Valeant business model.

""
“We believe it is critical to hold drug companies to account when they engage in ‘a business strategy of buying old neglected drugs and turning them into high-priced specialty drugs,’"" 18 Democratic representatives wrote in a letter to Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the House’s committee on oversight and government reform.

I choose the traditional plan and have a company match on the first 6% (50% in company stock and other 50% to my fund of choice) I chose to allocate all of my funds to the Fidelity Growth Company Fund (FDGRX). I was initially going to just put everything into the Vanguard 2055 target date fund but did not want that much exposure to international stocks and bonds. I'm just wondering if this is WAY to risky for someone my age and if the expense ratio is to high at 0.82%.

Google Inc Class C Capital Stock - 2.03	
NVIDIA Corp - 1.80	
Gilead Sciences Inc - 1.71	
Alkermes PLC - 1.67	
 
These holdings and the track record of this fund (since 1983 it has achieved a 13.18% average annual total return) were the main reason for me choosing this over a Vanguard Target Date Fund. As another option i was thinking of doing a 75/25 split between the Fidelity fund and one of the Vanguard target date funds.

There is no single answer to this question, but we will also need A LOT MORE information if we are to give some sort of answer

* How old are you?
* Are you employed/making income? How much?
* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)
* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)
* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
* Any big debts?
* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.

Be aware that these answers are just opinions of Redditors and should be used as a starting point for your research. You should strongly consider seeing a registered financial rep before making any financial decisions!

15-09-29,3mu16e,Biotech fund posts worst single-day drop in 4 years,"Similar to Friday, the slump in biotech and health-care stock helped fuel a selloff in the main indexes Monday. The leg lower was particularly bruising for the Nasdaq, which is home to a roster of biotech names.

The downdraft in biotech stocks comes fresh on the heels of the sector’s worst weekly performance in seven years and places the biotech fund, which hit its peak in mid July, squarely in bear-market territory, which is a decline of at least 20% from a recent peak. The Monday slump saw the IBB erase its gains for 2015 and put it squarely in negative territory, down 4.2% year-to-date.

Another biotech ETF, the SPDR S&amp;P Biotech ETF XBI, also saw its worst single-day performance, sinking more than 7.2% Monday.

Last week the biotech sector’s IBB suffered a more than 13% drop as presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton criticized drug prices and laid out a plan to curb costs. On Monday, Democrats asked the chairman of a House oversight panel to subpoena documents from drug maker Valeant Pharmaceuticals VRX, that would explain large price increases for two heart drugs.

The biotech industry has been one of the highest-flying sectors during the stock market’s bull run, and as a result has been the target of bubble calls by industry watchers and analysts.",9

15-09-30,3n19bo,"New 401(k) plan, need help with allocation","Hey everyone,

I recently switched employers and the new 401(k) plan is a bit frustrating. My old plan was with Fidelity and I invested 100% of it into the Vanguard Target 2060 Fund (I'm 26). This was simple, had a low expense ratio, and pain free.

My new plan doesn't have a simple allocation like this, and it's very difficult trying to understand the underlying information behind each of these equities. They want me to choose a % allocation into each fund, and the following are my equity options:

15-09-30,3myycp,Great commentary from GS reminding us how investing works,"http://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-sach-tim-oneill-podcast-episode-2015-9

Everyone here wants to say ""just invest in a broad market fund and let it sit because over time prices go up and you'll make a better return than anything else you come up with on your own"" - if you do this you're a type of free rider.  Stock prices are not a natural phenomenon.  Apple doesn't trade at X and then over time  go to X + 50% just because.  Stocks only trade at what we as investors decide they should trade at.  If we all pour our money into broad market funds, like S&amp;P funds, then our money has to be invested in the S&amp;P stocks and those stocks have to go up.  The only inherent return from stocks is dividends (and buybacks).  

Even Apple, with all its success, until quite recently was inherently worthless in a way because it paid no dividend.  It was too large to ever be taken over and it seemed content to hoard more and more cash forever.  Now, yes we knew that it couldn't do that for all of eternity and at some point it would be forced via some means to return capital to shareholders but it's a good lesson that companies have a lot of freedom for a long time to do nothing that provides any tangible return.  So the only return is via stock price appreciation which is something WE decide as investors.  And if the majority of us are not investors, but just customers - in the sense we just offer up our money in exchange for a receipt that says we own some generic product - then nothing that we own has any reflection of any accurate value and over time this will all crash down upon us.

I am interested in people's views on this and friendly discussion and debate",17

I know you can get an equal weighted ETF. But 1, there's maybe some sense to cap weighting. I don't want to invest in 75% of the companies in the S&amp;P. And #2, if you're using futures there's no equal weight.

if you have 50k and want to invest 150k on margin, you will pay interests on 100k, say 1.5% is the interest rate, and you will pay a total of 1500 a year in interest, + you will have to actively manage your funds to stay at the same leverage (and risk getting margin calls too)

of course leverage etf dont track the performance of the index well because they track something different than this, which is daily performance, but the expected value is basically the same, just with more variance.

Please do not talk about the decaying efect of the leverage etf, the same decaying effect will happen if you play on margin and keep the same leverage at all time, the idea here is to compare between the two.",15

To recap, yesterday I made a comment that I am a portfolio manager at a major financial institution, and that we have an Analyst Program for new college graduates interested in Investment Management. After a flurry of PMs, I thought it would be helpful for me to post here with clarification and set some ground rules. 

We are looking for college students with strong GPAs and a genuine interest in the financial markets. We have both summer internships and full time positions. We are a major institution with positions all over the US, so you need to be ok with relocation. 

If you are interested: Send me a PM with your name and email address. I will in turn email you with a full job description and more info on how to apply. 

In addition: I don't care what your username is, nor your post history. I won't share your username if you don't share mine, deal? However, if you have an inappropriate email address (iluvtitties@Hotmail) don't expect a response. 

Graduating college and finding a career you love can be daunting, and sometimes scary and depressing. I have found a career I love and will be happy to help where I can.

15-09-30,3mzvtv,Investing in unorthodox tech companies,"I'm looking for different startups that try to apply technological know-how to solve unorthodox problems. I'm very interested in finding out about technology and the ways it can improve the lives of all people: all the currently evolving fields, like biotech, networking, energy, aerospace and many others demonstrate incredible advancements every day. But when it comes to investing in technological ventures, I found it is better to look for startups that try to solve problems on a smaller scale and in less traditional fields, which are not widely known for producing huge breakthroughs year on year.

When trying to solve one specific, very niche problem, they do not have to operate in an environment filled with hundreds of companies, both from corporate and government sectors, all competing to solve the same paramount problems. What that means is that if they do have a good idea, which, realized correctly, can genuinely improve one small aspect of life, they have great potential for growth and the generated ROI can be immense, if you invest early enough.

Currently I'm trying to formulate the search and selection strategy more thoroughly and am also looking for places to find such startups at the stage of seed funding. Here are some sources I found:

1) [AngelList](https://angel.co/) - the most popular startup catalog, hence a lot of companies to choose from. But it's search function only features the most basic categories, which makes it hard to find the particular type of companies I need.

2) Dedicated startup digests (I've managed to find only two):

https://www.startupdigest.com/

http://investorsangel.com/

Sites like these release lists of new startups on a regular basis and group them, based on some characteristic or another. It is possible to find the companies I need there. [Here](http://investorsangel.com/news/115347/parking-revolution-5-new-startups-to-invest-in-this-year), for example, is an article with startups that use tech to solve parking problems, which is exactly what I was talking about earlier.

3) [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) and [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/): these are almost completely dedicated to the startups I was talking about, but there's a catch. The interaction with the presented companies is done exclusively from the standpoint of a customer, so if you want to invest, it can only provide some basic info about the companies and you have to search further on your own.

So, what do you think about this whole idea, and do you know any additional good sources for such startups?",6

15-09-30,3n0ehb,$YHOO Weighing Its Options,"The IRS has thrown a monkey wrench in Yahoo!'s (NASDAQ:[YHOO](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=yhoo&amp;fr=uh3_finance_web&amp;uhb=uhb2)) plans for a tax-free spin-off of its 384 million shares of Alibaba (NYSE:[BABA](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=baba&amp;fr=uh3_finance_web&amp;uhb=uhb2)), worth nearly $40 billion.

In late January, Yahoo! announced a [plan](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1011006/000119312515314494/d35793d8k.htm) for the spin-off of its remaining position in Alibaba into a newly-formed investment company, to be called Aabaco Holdings. Yahoo had planned for the stock of the new company to be distributed pro rata to existing Yahoo shareholders. After the completion of the proposed transaction, Aabaco Holdings would either directly or indirectly own the 384 million shares of Alibaba formerly owned by Yahoo, along with a 100% ownership interest in Aabaco Small Business, which would be a newly-formed entity that owns Yahoo Small Business. Yahoo Small Business currently operates as a division of Yahoo.

In order for the proposed transaction to be tax free, it must satisfy active trade or business requirements; it cannot merely be a vehicle to distribute profits, which is the reason Yahoo included the spin-off of Yahoo Small Business with the disposal of its Alibaba holdings. For all intents and purposes, Yahoo has essentially packaged 384 million shares of Alibaba with a relatively immaterial portion of its current operations in an attempt to avoid billions in taxes.

A similar [situation](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1606745/000104746914006875/a2221042zs-1a.htm) took place in 2014 with Liberty Interactive (NASDAQ:[QVCA](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?uhb=uh3_finance_vert&amp;fr=&amp;type=2button&amp;s=qvca)) spinning its holdings of TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:[TRIP](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=trip&amp;fr=uh3_finance_web&amp;uhb=uhb2)) into a holding company in order to distribute the profits tax-free to its shareholders, and to allow the company to continue trading without the overhanging risk of another publically-traded company on its books. In both cases, the operating division of the parent company involved in the spin-off was small, arguably immaterial. Since Liberty Interactive's scenario satisfied the active trade or business requirements, one would have thought Yahoo's case would be accepted as well.

But not so fast.

About a month after the announcement of its plan, Yahoo submitted a request to the IRS for a private letter ruling on whether or not Aabaco's ownership of Aabaco Small Business would satisfy the active trade or business requirements. Private letter rulings are submitted by a company when it wishes to receive an opinion from the IRS on whether a potential transaction could result in a tax violation; they are not a necessity. A positive private letter ruling from the IRS would mean Yahoo would know for sure the transaction would be completely tax-free to its shareholders and pass muster with the government body.

However, in mid-May, the IRS announced it was reconsidering its ruling policy with respect to the active trade or business requirements. Then in late July, the IRS formally announced that it was ""studying potential new administrative guidance with respect to certain issues"" that included the active trade or business requirements. This led the IRS to inform Yahoo in early September that it would not grant a ruling on the matter. It is important to note that the IRS did not directly indicate that it was ruling against the tax-free spin-off, but that it had rejected the request for a ruling.

After receiving the news that the IRS had rejected its request for a ruling, Yahoo formally withdrew its request, but the firm continues to work with its counsel on its spin-off plans. The seemingly complex ruling (or lack of a ruling) that took place may have been an indication from the IRS that it had planned to rule adversely on the proposed transaction Yahoo had in place at the time of its request, but that it was not axing it if Yahoo fine-tunes the deal to the IRS' liking.

Yesterday brought more news. [Yahoo](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/29/us-yahoo-spinoff-stocks-idUSKCN0RT18W20150929) said that it will in fact proceed with the spin-off despite the risk that the proposed transaction may not be tax-free. While there is upside potential associated with the price of Yahoo's shares as a result of the spin-off, the tremendous amount of downside risk--to the tune of billions in taxes that shareholders may be on the hook for--is far too great of uncertainty to garner our interest. We feel a much more enticing valuation opportunity for long-term investors exists in the shares of Alibaba itself, rather than in a gamble on an IRS ruling.

From our perspective, shares of Alibaba have been beaten down unfairly. The company was the subject of a widely-publicized bearish article recently, but we think fears are overblown, even as we say risks remain. We countered such an article in Brian Nelson's piece [here](http://valuentumbrian.tumblr.com/post/129084685045/5-counterpoints-to-the-puzzling-attack-on-alibaba), and we think the Chinese company may offer a better risk-adjusted proposition than the Yahoo situation. What the IRS does after the spin-off is anyone's guess, but we do know that they haven't given the thumbs up, which is enough for us to stay clear. The tax burden may eventually land in the laps of long-term shareholders of Yahoo.
