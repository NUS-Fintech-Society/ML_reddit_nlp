16-01-01,3yyzw7,Stock market 5-10% correction january 2016.,"Just wondering if anyone else senses a 5-10% pullback in January. People may be taking profits from the 7 year bull run while they are up significantly. In addition, January is the month with the least amount of buybacks occurring and sentiments seem to be negative so a small sell off can quickly turn into a large sell off.

Not trying to fear monger, and Im not selling off any of my equities, but I'm just wondering if anyone sees the same thing.

Happy new years by the way!

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=sd

It looks like some of the last trades of the day were very large, and at a high price, I don't see any corresponding news, but I did see a lot of talk about a short squeeze.  That doesn't make sense to me though.  Can anybody provide any insight?   

SD has been volatile and active - I've jumped in &amp; out a couple of times and done okay - I'm paying close attention because of the oil situation and the fact that SD traded at over $6 just over a year ago - if it can manage to stay alive, and it gets anywhere near that again, 20 cents is damn cheap.  In the meantime, it's very active, there's a lot of money trading hands daily.  

Anybody else have opinions about SD?  ",0

16-01-01,3yzg8s,Pernix Therapeutics (PTX),"I believe stock has potential for a break out to between $3.50 -$3.65.  I believe this because it is oversold, has promising sales potential primarily (Zohydro a non addictive pain killer) and promising existing sales.  I have provided a link so you can get started on further due diligence, I just want to put in on your radar.

http://seekingalpha.com/article/3664986-pernix-therapeutics-3_25-a-share-is-too-cheap

Pros:
PTX has 3 approved drugs on the market and beat earnings estimates by $0.07 a share last earnings.  Additionally, the stock has recently began a trend reversal breakout pattern.

Cons:
Debt due to drug acquisitions.

Drugs -

Silenor:

The company relaunched this product in May of 2014. Silenor is a non-addictive, non-scheduled sleep aid. The company is committed to develop an over the counter version of Silenor to help millions of people suffering from insomnia to have a more restless sleep. This medication could prove to be a major growth driver for Pernix providing patients with a more accessible treatment option and expanding our franchise beyond the current 2020 patent expiration.

The company met with the FDA in June to review their development plans. 40 million Americans have some sort of sleep disorder. The market is worth some $15 billion annually and Silenor has just a tiny slice (.2%) of market share that should grow over time. Silenor saw total prescriptions grow by 7% over the prior, and new prescriptions by 2% compared to the second quarter of 2015. Revenue from Silenor increased 21% to $5.1 million year-over-year this quarter.

Treximit:

This is a migraine treatment that Pernix acquired from GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) in the second half of 2014. It is a large market that Treximit only has approximately two percent market share currently. Earlier this year the company developed new packaging for this compound. The new package should help sales growth going forward. Treximet saw total prescriptions increase by 7% and new prescriptions grew by 13% in this quarter versus the second quarter of 2015. Growth and a price hike boosted revenue 76% year-over-year to just under $29 million in the third quarter.

Zohydro:

The company made a potential game changing purchase in the first quarter when it bought the Zohydro franchise from Zogenix (NASDAQ:ZGNX). This gets Pernix in the lucrative chronic pain space which is dominated by compounds like hydrocodone. Zohydro ER is an extended release, tamper resistant and non-addictive chronic pain reliever. The compound was just recently approved by the FDA. The chronic pain market is a huge opportunity as just one percent of the overall market equates to some $400 million annually in sales. Zohydro ER has several superior traits in that it is non-addictive and it cannot be abused or overdosed on. If Pernix can gain a foothold in the market, it is going to be a huge positive catalyst for revenues, cash flow and earnings growth in the years ahead.",8

I've been thinking about it for a time, and I am not sure this would be possible at all.

Let's name a company that often get a lot of heat: monsanto. I wouldn't want to invest in them, and I have refused to do so in the past. On the other hand: how do I know my sicav funds are all monsanto free? I don't.

And then: even if I decided to forego ETFs, funds, and the like and handpicked all of my investments in the stock market... how do I know whether a company is really ""moral"" or not? Enron seemed so fantastic, before it turned out to leave people without electricity to pump up prices.

Even just using tax heavens is one thing that effectively damages people and I'm even afraid to check how many companies actually engage in such practice.

So, my question to you is: is it possible to invest in companies that *really* operate in a honest, moral way? How does one find them?

The latest valuation estimates for Fidelity's private company investments includes a big markup for one Bay Area company planning an IPO and a big markdown for another.

The Wall Street Journal reports that the mutual fund giant said the value of its stake in San Francisco-based cloud communication company Twilio rose by 31 percent in November.

The Journal earlier this week reported that Twilio has filed confidentially to go public sometime in the first quarter of next year.

Its stake in San Jose software-defined storage company Nutanix dropped 10.7 percent in value.

Nutanix has filed to raise up to $200 million in what is expected to be the first big Silicon Valley IPO of 2016. It was figured to be worth about $2 billion when it raised its last private round in 2014.

Fidelity's November report on its holdings also showed slight changes in the values of several other companies in its portfolio. They are:
Dropbox was marked down 2 percent last month after being marked up 5 percent in October. Overall the value of the San Francisco-based storage and collaboration software company is down by 17 percent from where it was in June, according to Fidelity.

Zenefits was marked up by 6 percent in November. But the San Francisco human resources software company's value is figured to be 44 percent below what Fidelity paid for its private shares in May, when the company was valued at $4.5 billion.

Pinterest's value was estimated to be up 4 percent in November, and is up of 5 percent since June. The company was figured to be worth $11 billion when it raised funding in February.

Domo was marked down 2 percent in November, but is about double the value that Fidelity figured on the Utah business software company in January 2014.

Dataminr was marked up by 2 percent in November but is down by nearly a third from what Fidelity estimated the New York social media analysis company to be worth earlier in the year.

Snapchat was marked down by 0.8 percent in November and the Los Angeles-based messaging startup's value is down by about 15 percent since Fidelity invested in it in March, when it was valued at about $16 billion.

16-01-02,3z44tw,The Oil Play (Tell me why not),"Someone may have already posted something like this but I want to hear others opinions. So this is how Vladimir Putin fucked up the oil industry. After annexing Crimea, knowing that the US could not respond without all out war, Putin screwed his own country over. Russia is the biggest exporters of Natural Gas and one of the biggest exporters of oil in the world, so the US responded with an attack to their pocket. Obama called his Muslim friends in Saudi Arabia, the puppet state of the US (they live in a very bad neighborhood and we protect their wallets), and told them to flood the world in oil.
 
Gas prices plummeted, as we all know. Putin shits his pants, and decides that isis needs to be eliminated immediately and stabilize the region. Coincidence?? Anyways the Saudis can't keep this up forever. For about twenty years they reported a storage of 261 billion barrels of oil. A load of horse shit; they've been off the books for years and that number is just to exert a larger perceived control of the market. Most people know this is an outright lie or at least suspect that they messing with the reports no one is allowed to verify. There is also the logistic of where are these 108360000000000000 gallons of oil being stored? In some giant super secret, james bond villain esque, underground reservoir? Anyways oil production has long since peaked and the oil barons of the world are lying about their supply. Low supply, high demand. 

We have the opportunity to buy oil at bargain prices, but the only catch is we have to grab the falling knife. So where does the knife stop? I'm sure there are tons of people who have lost their chips betting on a bottom in the past few months, and I definitely don't want to be that person looking back in the spring. Thoughts?",0

January 1st happens to be a good time to do that re-balancing.  I moved nearly $100K into interest bearing cash back in August and sat out the turmoil.  Now I'm ready to get back into the market with a bit more cash than I would have had if otherwise.  Today I made three changes.

1. I changed my contribution percentage to max out my 401K
2. I changed the funds allocation and added 2 more funds
3. I moved the money from cash back into funds with high potential to outperform

As background, I made just over 5% return in 2015 which is not bad given that none of my possible fund investments returned more than 3%.  This was possible because I sat out the fall volatility in cash.

Summarize of Fingerprints Cards AB potential:
1. A world leading company, with a dominating market share and product reviews which is best in it's class.
2. Fingerprints Cards projected market share is 50-70% for 2016, given that Fingeprint cards has good visibility 5 months ahead it should be seen as reliable information. It's hard to predict longer than that.
3. Continued rapid growth without sensitivity to market conditions.
4. Gross margin is high but in the same level as other semiconductor manafacturers
5. Operating margin should rise during 2016 driven by smaller sensors. During a longer period the operating margin can become smaller because of possible pricing pressure and expansion to new product areas. At the moment there are no signs of that.
6. Still a undervalued stock.
7. A company continously disparaged by others that know too little of the company. 

The stocks predicted value within 6 months is: 700-800 sek

I'm a recent college grad and now work for a biotech/pharmaceutical company that offers a great 401K plan. They match half of what I contribute up to 8%, currently I'm putting in 6% with a 3% match. One thing that I've been considering is putting in less money and using that towards my student loans. I went to Penn State as an out of state student, so I racked up a good amount of student loans (roughly $70K). The interest rate on these loans range from 3.8-6.8%. I'm considering putting just  4% or even 2% towards my 401K and using the extra income to help pay off my student loans, since the loan interest will capitalize at a much higher rate than my 401K will grow. I have the option to choose where the money goes, and I believe I'm under the VFIFX plan as of now (I've considered putting it towards my company stock because of how well it's done, but that's pretty risky). I'd appreciate any input on what would be a good way to go about this, if my salary is an important factor to this then I can post that as well. Thanks!",7

I am looking for some community input. Note Im not looking for people to tell me to sell, this will be a long hold for me. Either till they go BK or until the stock actually becomes worth something more. 

This company has multiple divisions and does multiple things including gaming, application development, video streaming, media marketing, and even ice sculpting....haha not sure how ice sculpting got thrown into the mix. Let me just be clear, I don't care about all that. The only division I care about is their Ultraflix division which specializes in 4k video streaming.

I first learned about this company at CES(Consumer Electronic Show) in Vegas in 2014. I was immediately impressed by their demo! Mainly because 4k technology was new at the time and CES 2014 was really the first time I saw it. I started talking to the gentleman that was doing the demo and he started talking about their streaming technology and some of the crazy stats. At the time and I still think they are in the lead, they could stream 4k content with as little as 15 mbps internet speeds. I am now reading they recommend at least 6 mbps. 

I didn't buy their stock durning the 2014 week of CES, but I put it on my watchlist. I am happy I didn't pick any up back then, as it has only tanked since then. The management issued a lot of new shares after that and diluted the value of the shares big time. I eventually started accumulating shares as more and more positive news came out. 

Ultraflix has the largest 4K Ultra HD library of streaming content available, Ultraflix hosts hundreds of hours of 4K nature documentaries (including 40 titles originally created for IMAX), dozens of concerts, videos from acts like AC/DC and Madonna, and hundreds of hours of sci-fi, action, comedy, and drama, all for rental in 48 hour blocks. This is due to them signing on some big partners within the last year and building a pretty sizable library. 

Their library is larger than Netflix and Amazon's 4K library combined! This is mainly due to them signing a rather large deal with Paramount Studios. The terms of the deal have not be disclosed from what I could find(If you can find them please share), but they claim it allows them exclusive access to the streaming rights of the content. I am just unsure on how long the exclusive agreement is for and what they paid for the exclusivity.

On top of all the content they are on every 4k TV manufacture I can think of. They have deals with Vizio, Sony, Hisense, Nvidia Shield, Samsung, Android and Roku. They are the number 1 app on the Roku 4 which support 4k. They have said they will have Apps for the Fire TV and Apple TV shortly. 

I have personally used the service on a 4k TV and the streaming is pretty much flawless and looks incredible. I decided to try it when they were offering a cyber Monday sale. It looks like that sale worked so well they brought it back for a general holidays sale. I think this will help next quarters numbers a lot.

Anyway I think we will see some action this coming and next week as CES is this week(Jan 6th-9th). From my understanding they will be there demoing and they also have a few manufactures that will be using and demoing the product. 

Also I see a pretty good future for the company. They currently have an interm CEO, so I think they could find a quality CEO that would influence the share price a lot. Also they maybe working on a few other studio deals that haven't been disclosed yet. Also the amount of 4k TVs that have been sold are increasing rapidly.",13

- Iran surrendered its nuclear material to lift the sanctions on it going into the oil trade. The moment the are lifted they're expected to add 500k bpd to world supply with the majority heading to China/India [(link)](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-02/iran-says-post-sanctions-crude-output-boost-won-t-hurt-prices)

- Russia and Iran agreed to conduct their trade using the Ruble &amp; Rial instead of the dollar/petrodollar system... this hasn't typical gone well for those attempting to ditch this system but I don't know how it will play out. Maybe a FOREX play... [(link)](http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2015/12/26/443306/Russia-Iran-to-ditch-Dollar-for-Ruble-Rial/)  
  
- The US lifted the export ban on oil with the first tanker setting sail yesterday. $COP was the first one there selling the oil to Vitol with another being filled at the moment. $COP also pulled out of Russia selling its portion of a large plant they operated there. The ban was originally put in place in the 70's to combat the fuel shortage/gas lines at the time.

- Russia named the US among threats to its national security [(link)](http://news.yahoo.com/putin-names-united-states-among-threats-russian-security-110515740--business.html)

- My guess is all parties involved need to continuing to drill baby drill
  
I'm thinking a good play would be $EPD as they have the pipeline system for shipping WTI to the coast for shipping. The bad news is it's a MLP which makes taxes a bitch. It does pay a hefty dividend as a passthrough but again it's a bitch during tax time. It's taking a beating this year and is at a good buying level. Another option could be $ETE which should also far more upside but again, it's an MLP. $KMI may be the better option as a former MLP now traded like a normal corp. I've got a friend who is an analyst who says stay away from $KMI but fuck him.  
  
The shale producers are in a tough spot but it leaves an opportunity for some consolidation in the sector with the good ones being acquired. High debt, low availably of credit and low oil prices are bad news for these guys. Shale producers need $40-$50 a barrel to pay the high-yield bonds they used for financing.  
  
$COP may be a good pickup given the news above as well.

recently read a WSJ article about keeping it simple when looking at securities(http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/12/24/this-simple-way-is-the-best-way-to-predict-the-market/)  There were 3 metrics that he looked at.

1. Starting Yield(Annual Dividends/Stock price).  Is this any different that the Dividends that are paid through the year?

2. Earnings Growth(Or earnings growth-rate).

3. Price to Earnings Ratio.

Does anyone know a website/Stock screening tool to filter securities based on these 3 metrics(based on the numbers that I would put in?).

I've checked a few sites but I'm not sure if the categories I was using are correct(like the yield and the earnings growth rate)

The thing that has always kind of bugged me is the way they portray the heroes as the only ones who could see that the real-estate bubble was a fraudulent sham and were thus able to make a ton of money by betting against the market. In my very limited experience, I remember plenty of the folks in the industry understanding that they were living in a bubble, but as they had no outlet to bet against the bubble, they rode it for all they could. Sure you had some folks living beyond their means on debt waves - but a lot of these mortgage originators types who made a ton of money profiting from the loans came away with significantly increased net worths. In my mind, the genius of the heroes of the book was their novel utilization of the CDS to bet directly against the bonds in question, rather then their realization that the market was a sham.

Finally, my question: If I was a normal, non-institutional investor in 2006-2007, would I have had an avenue to ""short"" real estate? If not, can we blame the folks who rode the bubble as long as they did?",9

The Theo T tanker has left NuStar Energy LP’s dockside facility in Corpus Christi, Texas, along the western shore of the Gulf of Mexico, Mary Rose Brown, a spokeswoman for NuStar, said in an e-mail. The ship is carrying a cargo of oil and condensate to Italy from ConocoPhillips’s wells in south Texas that was sold to Swiss trading house Vitol Group.

A campaign by oil explorers including Continental Resources Inc., Chevron Corp. and Exxon Mobil Corp. to lift the 1970s-era export prohibition culminated in a Dec. 18 congressional decision to end the ban.

Vitol, which owns stakes in refineries from northern Europe to Australia, has a second cargo of U.S.-sourced crude scheduled to depart a Houston port within days.

However Company Y has regulatory risk - risk of rejection of licence application by local government.

If licence application by Company Y gets rejected, it is foreseeable it could go to zero and I can wear this loss but still have Company X trudge along paying dividends. 

However if Company Y gets approval, I think it's price will gain significantly. Company X might take a hit in this case but it is unlikely to go to zero.

16-01-03,3zabm0,Are there markets for trading a stock for another stock? Its needed to stabilize economy against the danger of trading X for Y for Z for X profitably,"A danger of too much centralization of currency and stock and other value types is that loops are not travelled, so the loops get toll booths, delays and fees, built up inside them, and people learn to do everything through the one or few main currencies local to them. Markets which would trade directly between 2 different stocks, like 4.5 this for 84.4 of that (arbitrary ratio as you should always view it as 1 to 1, unless unbalanced), would be competition for such disorganization delays fees and overregulation. If free markets can trade on all paths, instead of just through ""all roads lead to rome"" and back, then profitable trading cycles would naturally be competed down to balanced enough that people would only want to trade if they predict longterm change.

The simplest model I can think of for trading value is, between 2 choices we'll call BLUE and GREEN, that everyone may start with a tiny amount of blue andOr green (not significant amounts, not really giving it away) or receive it some way, and each piece of blue could choose to become green, and each piece of green could choose to become blue, 1 to 1 and no trading. Its not a buy or sell. Its a vote, like for a corporations leader, but its just a 1 bit choice between 2 things. What would balance it is that at all times the total green is scaled to 1.0 and the total blue is scaled to 1.0, so if you change your blue to green, and it was already mostly balanced in perceived value, then you have created a surplus of green and your new green (and everyone's green by the same ratio) is reduced in number to total 1.0, and inversely blue gains value to scale to total 1.0 blue. This appears related to bayes rule and sigmoid, but I'm still thinking about how. There may be some reward for creating the best root node of the blockchain like in bitcoin, of whatever ""transaction fee"" each person may choose to sacrifice (I'll take .99 times as much green as I traded blue, for example, and transaction fee gets .01*amount in that case, or whatever number or 0 if you can get others to accept such a piece of data and digital signature)... Its based on Rock Paper Scissors and the math property that the fourier of a bell curve is another bell curve, which I only vaguely understand but its definitely got both waves and bell curves in the same place if gametheory works between the players. There would be 1 of these 2-way trading numbers for each thing that people are interested in comparing. Unlike trading stocks for a price, all things are equal value and in units of 1.0 and could be hooked directly into speakers and microphone and neuralnets using their normal kind of numbers. I think Economic Soliton Theory may be a relevant place to look for the wave math. Solitons are moving waves that hold their shape. I imagine people could use such a system like a game where mouse movements left vs right, or up vs down (or other inputs/outputs) would turn the future, from their view, upsidedown so what would have gone down in value goes up, maybe seen as screen getting brighter/darker or sound changing tone continuously or whatever way to hook it into the subconscious mind most directly and get the simplest game loop. We wouldnt even need the ""real"" stock markets if we can simulate value vibration of the same kind of stock waves in realtime just in a game. If such an experiment worked, the real stocks and other parts of the world might hook in by becoming players with digitalSignatures making gambles for ""game money"" of various parts of the system, and if people found that to be useful in predicting the game, those stock market computing systems would gain value in the game and have influence on the GREENs vs BLUEs (or n options all equally valued, per game) so nobody would get anything for free but only in exchange for good predictions in the game.",0

Fair Value = Book Value + the sum of the three year weighted average of the adjusted pretax earnings per share.

AMD's place in the market has always been taking the performance of an intel chip released 2-3 years ago, and making it much cheaper.

My personal profit margins (income-expenses) are quite high right now due to my high income and low maintenance lifestyle.

I have two student loans:

1) $9600 @5.6% (private), pay $73/month

2) $7200 @6.8% (federal), pay $99/month

What I have been doing is taking the money I would have been using to pay down the student loans and investing it with the justification that the returns on a total stock market indexed fund returns an average of 7.5% (higher than the interest rate on the loans) and the money is liquid, unlike the money I use to pay down debts.

Right now I have enough money to live off of for &gt;1 year negating the need to save more for a rainy day fund.  After maxing my 401k (which I already do), would it make sense to stay on this course of investing&gt;paying down debt or should I move my new money into the loans and pay them off asap?

One factor to consider is the possibility that a Democratic government could reduce the interest rate on the federal student loan to 4% at some point in the future",5

That being said, technical trading is not for everyone. I am not trying to incite a riot on whether or not you think technical trading works or not. Fundamentals have worked for many and I admire those who trade around it, but given my trading style I have concluded it is not for me.

Furthermore, technical trading will be beat by huge fundamental plays every single time. So with what I'm going to say, do not ask about stocks that have controversial or important events coming up because technicals probably will not work.

The timeframes given will be approximately one week max.

EDIT:

*$KKR*:

[6m1D Chart Here](http://i.imgur.com/cgvVgs6.png)

I'll start with saying this thing is in consolidation and perhaps weighs more heavily on announcements as it does on TA. However, TA can help you plan your play in either case.

As seen in the chart, this thing is resting on a support and approaching a resistance, a very critical time for KKR. I am overall bullish on this stock for the following reasons.

- MOMENTUM

Momentum has shot up a lot. It has crossed over from negative to positive, coupled with TTM Squeeze - which shows negative to positive buying pressure - provides a very bullish indicator on the stock for the week.

- Money Wave is prepped for a rebound

The stochastics are very ready to blast off, they have been decreasing and finally bottomed out the last trading day. If momentum can hold up, this should see a nice 1 - 2 day pop, an easy swing of maybe $1 - $1.50 gain (PT 15.80 - 16.00). However, the resistance is very near the current price, and this makes the next couple days critical. It appeared to have held the support, and if it can break resistance then this price will really soar. 

If this breaks support drop the stock immediately, if not, set a trailing stop and love it. 

The only bearish indicator I have found, apart from it possibly breaking the support, is that the SCTR indicates this stock is severely under performing from it's past and is not strong on the move. Although it is not entirely convincing, there is a chance that a pullback can come from any negative press news or fundamental change. This can become a momentum stock, and if it does these next two days will prove if it can or not.




*$AAPL*:

Undoubtedly the hardest to analyze, this really can go either way entirely depending on tomorrow.

As seen in the [2y1w Chart](http://i.imgur.com/3tVZNH5.png) and the [6m1d Chart](http://i.imgur.com/tNbzGTC.png)

Overall, I cannot give a certain evaluation as this stock depends heavily on tomorrow's performance; that being said, I would say slightly bearish for the month.

Bullish indicators:

- RSI 

AAPL is very close to being oversold, IF tomorrow can hold the support AND AAPL does not have a huge movement day, RSI will become extremely bullish as it will revert to the 45-60 range. HOWEVER, if tomorrow is a huge red day, RSI will become very bullish but it might not entirely matter based on Support and Resistance.

- Weekly Money Wave

Contrary to the daily money wave, this thing is so oversold it's not even funny. If AAPL manages to hold the support, two weeks from now we can see massive, massive gains. The stochastics show a pop is imminent. Even if it does break support, one last pop is almost assured. Swing traders don't count it out yet.

Bearish Indicators:

- Price Action

AAPL no longer seems to be the unstoppable tech giant it once was, and it is scaring people. Retail investors are losing faith and this stock is dropping. I'm not going to get too much into technicals but it is showing in the chart.

Volume is also lower than average.

- SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE

This may be the entire bulk of this analysis. AAPL is resting on a HUGE support at the moment. If you check the 2y1w chart, you'll notice AAPL just completed a head and shoulders pattern, normally a reversal - which indicates heavy bearish. If tomorrow or tuesday AAPL breaks that support then it is downhill until the next support. Watch the lines closely.

- TTM Squeeze and Momentum

Selling pressure is going down ENORMOUSLY and so is Momentum. If this holds true tomorrow, then AAPL can fall, and fall hard. A quick glance at the indicators show VERY strong bearish for the week.

- SCTR

AAPL is performing horrendously compared to it's past and recent strength and performances. This can be seen by anyone in price action, but RSI shows it as well.

- Money Wave

Although it does seem bearish, the 50 mark for the money wave is a very, very common reversal point. If tomorrow ends green, it would be a good idea to hold it for a day or two as it may be green until Wednesday. Weekly calls should net nicely in this scenario.


As I said this is a toss up. If tomorrow is heavily bearish then this can and will tank. Although if this does happen a slight pulback is still imminent as it is oversold on the weekly indications. Whatever you choose, do so carefully and DO YOUR OWN DD.







*$GILD*:
[6m1D Chart Here](http://i.imgur.com/6bTcYke.png)

Jesus, this stock is odd. I WILL REEMPHASIZE THAT THIS IS A BIOSTOCK AND ANY TA CAN VERY WELL BE VOIDED EASILY. The reason this may hold true to TA is because it is in earnings, it is valued higher than most biotechs we as a sub see, and it is not a shit show entirely. 

Overall, I am slightly bearish on this for the week. Although there MAY be a slight pop, it would be risky to try and time a biotech.

Bullish Indicators:

- TTM Squeeze

We are entering a squeeze period with GILD for the week, coupled with positive momentum, it can prove to be a quick pop. It is up to you to determine the direction of this company, these are just indications. 

Buying pressure has increased to bring the TTM squeeze from a sell-bias to a buy-bias. This can be good with positive momentum and a squeeze period, a perfect setup for a scalper and swing trader.

Bearish Indicators:

- Volume

Volume has been very low compared to the average volume, and with a squeeze alert, any major volume change can and WILL dictate the movement of this stock for the week. 

- SCTR

This stock is performing horribly compared to it's past recent performance and strength. This is a strong bearish indication.

- Money Wave

The money wave is very choppy. And although it is indicating bearish with a bearish bias last trading day, it is the least credible indicator for this stock. A quick green day tomorrow and this can very well turn bullish for the week. Keep this in mind as it is extremely important.

- Momentum

Although momentum can turn one way or another very quickly, right now it is slightly positive with a strong bearish bias. If tomorrow is a green day then this too will become a bullish indicator, but if it continues as last trading day then this will be a strong bearish indicator.

- Price Action

GILD is trading just below the 250 EMA, and as it could - by definition - revert to the line, it is more inclined to drop a bit from it first before returning, which makes this slightly bearish.


As stated before, it is a biotech and it can run either way, but looking at the chart, and the chart alone, I would give a slightly bearish indication for the week.







*$UA*:

[6 Month 1 Day and 1 Year 1 Week Charts here](http://imgur.com/a/LqNBv)

*Overall Sentiment*

Bearish for the week, Bullish for the Month.

As with all other analysis, any sudden or new events regarding press, news, or fundamentals should be accounted and could void any technical indicators. This is not an invitation or a go ahead to buy or sell, rather my opinion on what I think *could* happen.

Bullish Indicators:

- On the [1 Year 1 Week (1y1w) chart](http://imgur.com/YJ6zRTE), it is hanging towards the lower bollinger band (BB). 
   
Usually, in most stocks that behave rationally, there is an eventual return to the 20 day MA. This can be seen as bullish as it is currently under the 20 day simple moving average.

- UA is still way above the 250 EMA, a very good sign and a bullish trend. 

Although the outlook for the week may look grim, it can also be a great entry price for a week or more of holding. This appeals more to the patient and long term investor.

- UA's 1y1w chart shows a very undersold indicator with slow stochastics.

 You can see the money wave is well under the oversold mark and more money should be pouring into this for the next 2-3 weeks. Unless something fundamentally changes, it could be a solid play to grab some calls for February.

- The 6m1D TTM Squeeze shows bullish bias, but is still heavily negative.

Be careful with this, it could go either way, and the way the markets (SPY, QQQ, etc.) open, it could influence the way traders approach this.

Bearish Indicators:

The bearish indicators are more short term, mainly for the week.

- UA's [6m1d Chart](http://imgur.com/7VPpnp4) shows many bearish indicators, one of the most important being a very bearish money wave.

 The stochastics are greatly approaching 20, and it still has room to fall for the week. Be careful though as the end of the week should see a beginning of a rebound. 

- Momentum is still negative and has a bearish bias

Overlayed on the TTM squeeze shows a bearish bias towards the momentum, which currently sits below 0. This, coupled with a mid-low RSI can be an indication that there is a tiny bit more to fall for the week. Strength wise, this stock is very low compared to it's past performances (SCTR indicator.)

In summary, some weekly puts *MAY* be a good idea, although if it is too risky, a safer, but not sure fire, play would be some Feb calls. I do not feel entirely convinced on this as UA seems to be teetering on the fence of bottoming out soon or falling a tad more. As I said previously, I do not know about news or fundamentals and any negative press can void these evaluations very easily. DO YOUR OWN DD.





*$DAL*:

[DAL's 6m1d Chart](http://i.imgur.com/ieaYs4n.png)

Overall, I am very bullish on this stock if it can hold the support today.

As seen in the chart, the last trading day has established a support, which now makes a very nice channel for DAL. If this channel is held for a little bit some very nice swing gains can be gained from this. Here are the bullish indicators:

- Price action

This has been increasing, and is well above the 250 EMA, a strong stock at the moment. No complaints. If the support is held from the last trading day, and tomorrow is green, it will be an amazing entry point. If not, I would wait until it begins to consolidate.

- Money Wave

This can be very iffy an go both ways. It is bearish, but with a bullish uptick on the last day. If the support is held from the last trading day, it might be an amazing entrance, and early. You might even beat some of the momentum/swing traders into this. 

- SCTR

This stock is performing VERY well in comparison to it's past recent performances and it's bullish undertone is beginning to show.

Bearish indicators:

- RSI

Yeah it is a bit bearish. It's about high-mid, but it is pointing downwards. The reason this would be bearish to me is because there would be little room to explode before easily becoming overbought, whereas it could fall and take more to become oversold. If tomorrow holds the support the RSI will probably increase or stay the same, leaving it a little bit high but nothing too bad.

- Momentum

Honestly this zig-zag crap can be off-putting. It seems to be bearish, but once again everything comes back to if the support is held. And since the support being held is bullish, in my opinion it outweighs any bearish indicators. Momentum points that tomorrow could be a flat - slightly green day.

- TTM Squeeze 

We have been decreasing in buying pressure which is an obvious bearish indicator; HOWEVER, there is a squeeze period which we have just entered. The next few days (coupled with support resistance) are crucial to the future price action of this stock. Be wary and do not make your purchases at open until a pattern can be seen or established. 

As always any fundamental or news events will void these indications and the stock will need to be reconsidered. These are just indications and NOT predictions.",21

16-01-04,3zczhx,I need some kind of leveraged product of an inverse ETF. Explanation inside. Kind of urgent.,"First, I know I'm not supposed to ask my questions here but I see people doing it anyway and no ""daily advice"" thread. Also this is quite important to me so I ask for some leniency this time...

My father died last summer and my immediate family and I will split a number of funds that we received in inheritance. Problem is this is taking the bank really long. Six months and counting and I have no idea when they will finish the surely herculean task of splitting some funds and making new contracts for us. Needless to say I won't stay with them after this is over, but I digress...

My worry is that it is too much money in too volatile assets that I don't have a clue about for who knows how long (maybe a few more months, maybe in two weeks, no idea) and I don't want to risk it, it's too much that I can stand to lose.

About 40% of the assets are in US funds and the rest in international ones and european ones. I guess for the short term a broad index like the S&amp;P500 would correlate well with my portfolio (for instance, in case of a crash). I don't have as much money as I'm going to inherit. You know where this is going... can I use my money as an average Joe to buy some leveraged product on an inverse S&amp;P500 or this kind of product is normally restricted to VIP clients, companies and so on? I really have no clue about derivatives.

I need some ideas. I'm not in the US by the way, I'm in Europe but I ask here for economies of scale (biggest general investing forum that I know of) and I'm sure to a good extent banks offer the same to their clients and operate similarly.

By the way, I think the US market is very overvalued at the moment and ripe for potentially big dip and that's the main source of my preoccupation.

Trading was halted at about 1:34 p.m. local time on Monday after the CSI 300 Index dropped 7 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. An earlier 15-minute suspension at the 5 percent level failed to stop the retreat, with shares extending losses as soon as the market re-opened. Traders said the halts took effect as anticipated without any major technical problems.

but at the same time, numerous professionals endorsing the site as members of ""Team Pokerstars"" have departed the site, cancelled their contracts or declined to renew, citing unethical behaviour in management including reneging on agreements to pay players rewards they had earned in previous years.

The players on the site to some degree are playing more, but with smaller amounts of money (as traffic in high stakes and mid stakes games has declined) and the company simultaneously uses very very carefully worded statements to make things sound better than ever.

We're seeing economic declines worldwide which hasn't really manifested in the US yet(although underemployment is certainly an issues here) that will eventually make its way here. We're looking at a P/E ratio of 21.5 for the S&amp;P 500 as of Dec 31 versus an earnings growth around 0. 

The only reason the P/E ratio is so high is because money flowed into stocks at a crazy rater after QE and low bond yields. That will eventually end once people realize the earnings just aren't there to support a 21.5 P/E. Sure - lots of the growth slowdown is blamed on oil but oil is low because of slowdowns in manufacturing and other areas which will eventually float down to the general public and mean slowing growth across the board. Hell - a 30% decrease to get to a more reasonable 15 P/E wouldn't surprise me either.

16-01-04,3zgc9e,What Are Binary Options ?,"1) What Are Binary Options?

[BInary Options](https://uniqoption.com) are estimates of underlying assets performance during a given time frame. To understand the beauty of binary options trading, let’s first take a look at how investment in other trading markets usually works.
In most forms of investment the investors actually purchases the asset they invest in and the value of the profit and loss is determined upon the changing value of the asset. If the investor sells the asset back to the market whenever its value increases then they're making a profit, and if they sell the asset back to the market when its value decreases, then their money is lost.
This type of investment requires the investor to constantly worry about when to sell the asset and get out of the market to avoid exposing his entire account to the market’s volatility. Conversely, BO trading is simpler.
In options we trade futures on the market and not in the market like other trading methods, and thus the amount of psychological stress isn’t expressed, as you are just predicting the asset's movement for a predetermine time frame.",0

My goal is to have a forum of how I reach the conclusion to make these trades, and hope either they can be discussed or you can simply see what logic I used and learn why it worked or didn’t work.

For this experiment I’m going to be using an app called Stock Wars, which gives you $100,000 in startup cash. The reason I am doing this is because although I make personal trades, I don’t have enough cash in my personal account to make a truly diversified portfolio. The app also is fairly realistic except for liquidity (my trades don’t actually affect the real price as does a normal trade). The only other downside is you can’t trade options, so for any puts/calls I’ll put how much I would invest and take it off my portfolio.

If you go to http://stockwars.cidevelop.com/portfolios and search valerestrategies you can find my portfolio there as well.

Analysts estimates over 1 trillion yuan worth of shares maybe dumped when the sales ban runs out.  The ban was imposed at the height of a market rout that saw the mainland markets lose US$4 trillion in value last year.  The ban helped stabilise the market with the Shanghai Composite Index ending 2015 up 10 per cent and Shenzhen surging 65 per cent on the year.

I had bought $SCTY at $28.41 and called the gain back to around $60. It rallied hard that week. The company had a press release with their shares at about $44. I did not understand the chemistry going on in the conference alongside their shares loosing that day... So I put a stop loss order at $39.50 for a little safety. I did not actually think it would go down that much but I was proved wrong. When the order had executed I knew that I had made a mistake. Immediately after that they rallied up past $55 and now I am severely disappointing in myself.

Later that day I was moping about the stock to my good friend who expertise is in cryptocurrencies. He told me how he had a similar experience with BitCoin during the 2013 November/December rally. My friend had put a stop loss order on his Bitcoins at $800. During that day someone had decided to try to crash the market by selling his coins at $200 a pop. His stop loss order executed... My friend had lost almost $4,000 that day.

At that moment I had decided that stop loss orders are not a good idea.

Ideally I'm looking at a measure that is strictly based off of OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) and Volume Data.

My thoughts so far are a basic change of change method. For example the change in closing price from period 1 to period 2 is X, the change in price from period 2 to period 3 is Y.

Snarky summary by upads:

1. China's market is free with Chinese characteristics.  A free market with Chinese characteristics indeed, full of Chinese characteristics, known as ""free market"" by the Chinese.

2. Long story short, China's economy doesn't look good, so they looked for ways to cook the books and make themselves look better.  The easiest solution?  Have the factories put their cash in the stock market, and prop up the stock market!

3. Since China has changed their accounting laws back in 2010, your assets in the stock market no longer count as ""reserve"" and is instead put on the table and counted as hard, solid assets that you can liquidate like cash.  Surely nothing can go wrong here.

4. WRONG.  No matter how much you prop up a stock market, [over valued is over valued.](http://www.cnbc.com/2015/06/01/china-stocks-nearly-a-quarter-overvalued-credit-suisse.html)  You can't prop up a stock market indefinitely.

5. So what happens when the hands that's proping up the market gets tired?  Of course it crashes!  But oh shit!  We need to look good! We need to fart out more money to support the stock market!  Losen the lending requirements!  Release the capital reserves!  Issue more bonds!  Do whatever it takes, even if it destroys our economy in the long term, to look good TODAY!

16-01-05,3zk5vz,When does it make sense to open a position on margin?,"So right to the chase, when does it make sense to buy a stock on margin?  To me the answer would be when your expected growth + dividend outpace your margin interest rate, but I would hope that you could invest on margin in order to just get value rather than speculate on large growth positions.

I ask because I'd like to open some positions in a few solid dividend growth stocks but am not optimistic that the combined dividend + growth would be currently be greater than the expected interest rate.  So at that point I feel like I'm just ""renting"" a losing stock and hedging against the possibility of it increasing in price and keeping me from buying in later.  Is that the right way to look at it? In most cases, am I better off not buying anything on margin and using cash when I have it available?  

I just got finished paying off my new car and have some extra cash to put towards investing, but am not sure if I'm better served investing on margin and setting up a larger bi-weekly deposit (how i contribute to this account now) or contributing cash until I have enough to make the purchases I'd like to make.

We Still Need to Eat — The Case for Investing in Agriculture,"To quote Jim Rogers (as reported in Barron’s, November 16 issue), “I would buy agriculture with both feet, energy with a toe, and watch the others.” Mr. Rogers, an investor extraordinaire and former partner-in-crime to hedge fund manager George Soros, is long the Elements Rogers International Commodity Agriculture (RJA) [an instrument he fashioned], which has lately been flirting with the dramatic low reached at the end of 2008 and thus is quite depressed… If you are a contrarian investor of sorts, it’s got to catch your attention. Mr. Rogers comments, “There are more people in the U.S. who study public relations than study agriculture. It has been a nightmare industry for a long time, and that’s got to change.“

Here is the bottom line: the law of supply and demand may soon change the performance profile of agricultural investments. Agriculture supply is constrained by the limited expansion and saturation of agricultural land, resource scarcity, increasing environmental pressures, global warming, droughts, the lack of major recent technological breakthroughs to improve productivity, and rising production costs. The growth rate of global agricultural production is thus expected to drop to 1.5% over the next few years from above 2% over the past few (based on OECD forecasts).

Meanwhile, demand continues to grow rapidly thanks to a combination of growing populations, higher incomes and evolving diets in developing markets like India, China, Africa, etc. (where caloric intake including meat consumption is exploding). The growing structural imbalance between supply and demand may augur a rise in agricultural prices — and the number of parties organized by exuberant farmers!

The fact that the world needs to be fed is undeniable and the pressure to improve crop yields and produce bacon and ice cream augments everyday. Add Starbucks’ (SBUX) insatiable quest for beans and our families’ appetite for chocolate and you get the picture. But the trend is your friend. So far there has been little momentum building up from an investor’s standpoint. Most agricultural ETF’s and mega agricultural corporate players have underperformed the major indexes. How early do you want to be?

Assuming you want to invest at the earliest stages (that is, before the rally ignites, whenever that is), how do you play the hopefully-soon-to-materialize trend? Well, you may follow Jim Rogers’ lead and go with RJA, which follows the Rogers International Commodity Index – Agriculture Total Return index and represents 20 agricultural commodity futures contracts; it has an expense ratio of .75%.

Or go with the more liquid PowerShares DB Agriculture ETF (DBA), which tracks the performance of the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index – Optimum Yield Agriculture Excess Return; this index is composed of futures contracts and widely traded commodities. DBA has an expense ratio of .85%. The iPath Bloomberg Grains Subindex Total Return ETN (JJG), which tracks the Dow Jones-UBS Grains Subindex Total ReturnService Mark, is yet another option. 

Alternatively – or concomitantly – you may choose to invest in ETF’s for coffee (JO, CAFE) and/or sugar (SGG, CANE). All of these vehicles’ prices have been depressed for some time and seem to be in the process of bottoming out. But again they have yet to make a significant move upward, hopefully in high volume, to signal a change in trend. Oops, seems like CANE and SGG are trying to do exactly that, aren’t they?

Is it truly possible the United States is going to fully transition from fossil fuels to “clean, green energy”? Do we really believe the United States is going to abandon proven fossil fuels, such as coal? Even when the U.S. is commonly referred to as the [“Saudi Arabia of coal”](http://www.geocraft.com/WVFossils/Energy.html)?

[It has been proven that coal resources in the United States (the entire estimated volume that is within the earth) totals 10 trillion short tons, and would last over 9000 years (!!!) at today’s consumption levels.] (http://instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/HutzlerPowderRiverBasinTestimony.pdf)

Folks, coal isn’t going anywhere for a *long, long, long, time.*

So, what does this have to do with “climate change”?

Well, when in doubt, follow the money.

**Education Industry:**

Barack Obama, a constitutional law professor, has received over $3 million dollars from the University of California/CALPERS ([2008](http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.php?cycle=2008&amp;cid=N00009638) and [2012](http://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/contrib.php?cycle=2012&amp;id=N00009638)) and over $45 million from the education industry, mostly teachers unions ([2008](http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/indus.php?cycle=2008&amp;cid=N00009638) and [2012](http://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/indus.php?cycle=2012&amp;id=N00009638)) as political contributions.

We also know CALPERS and various teachers unions is [invested](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/mh?s=ACI+Major+Holders) in coal companies Arch Coal Inc. (ACI) and Peabody Energy (BTU), which both make up over 30% of the coal production in the United States.

**Banking Industry:**

Barack Obama has received over $22 million from investment banking industry ([2008](http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/indus.php?cycle=2008&amp;cid=N00009638) and [2012](http://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/indus.php?cycle=2012&amp;id=N00009638)).

Billionaire-banker George Soros has [contributed to the political campaigns](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/soros-donates-15-million-to-pro-obama-pacs/2012/09/27/6c8cb472-08e4-11e2-afff-d6c7f20a83bf_story.html) of Barack Obama AND Hillary Clinton. We also know George Soros [has large stakes](https://www.snl.com/interactiveX/Article.aspx?cdid=A-33567529-11817&amp;FreeAccess=1) in some of the [same coal companies](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/17/the-new-king-coal-george-soros/) as the teachers unions do.

Billionaire-investor Warren Buffett has also contributed to Obama’s campaign, [both](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/09/warren-buffetts-rule-give-big-to-get-obama-re-elected/) in 2008 and 2012. 

Warren Buffett already owns key elements in the supply chain of the coal industry. For example, two of Arch Coal’s (ACI) mines operate in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming ([Mine 1](http://www.archcoal.com/aboutus/coalcreek.aspx) and [Mine 2](http://www.archcoal.com/aboutus/blackthunder.aspx)). The coal from these mines are transported away as part of a joint operation with the rail system Burlington Northern Santa Fe, which is fully owned by — you guessed it — Warren Buffett’s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway!

Berkshire also [owns](http://www.investingdaily.com/11155/warren-buffett-is-betting-big-on-coal/) MidAmerican Energy, an electric utility that operates 11 coal-fired power plants, four of them located in Wyoming.

Side note: Buffett has allowed Obama to [use his name for political clout](http://whitehouse.blogs.cnn.com/category/warren-buffett/) to sell the public on why they should pay more in taxes (“Buffett Rule”). Still trying to figure out why that one out…

**Now onto Obama’s Coal Plan:**

Since entering office in 2008, Obama has been relentless in his pursuit to shut down the coal industry. Some have even gone so far as to call it a [“War on Coal”](https://gop.com/obamas-war-on-coal-is-official/).

His EPA regulations have [crippled](http://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2014/06/04/coal-industry-utilities-brace-for-epa-carbon-rules/) the coal industry, forcing them to continually implement more technologically efficient processes simply to stay alive.

But Barack Obama and his cronies friends are no dummies. He doesn’t really want to KILL the coal industry. He simply wants to get it down to it’s [last dying breath](http://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ACI&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=0&amp;p=m). 

He knows that whoever the next president is will immediately repeal all his EPA regulations that are hurting the coal industry and its workers across the country. This regulatory relief, over time, will eventually increase coal production in the United States back to pre-Obama levels. This production, along with the efficiency technologies implemented during his presidency, will greatly increase the value of the coal companies thought to be left for dead from regulatory burdens.

The United States has coal resources [worth over $20 trillion dollars](http://instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/HutzlerPowderRiverBasinTestimony.pdf). I don’t care how many climate change [playdates](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations) are held. That kind of money simply doesn’t get left in the earth untouched.

**In Conclusion:**

So, in conclusion, who benefits? I think this arrangement might resemble what is going on. 

• President Obama: Receives campaign donations ==&gt; Use EPA to shut down coal industry
• University of California: Donates to Obama ==&gt; Buy coal stocks at dirt-cheap prices
• Teachers Unions: Donates to Obama ==&gt; Buy coal stocks at dirt-cheap prices
• Bankers: Donates to Obama &amp; help sell policy to public (“Buffet Rule”) ==&gt; Buy coal stocks at dirt-cheap prices (side perk: Warren Buffet gets awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom…[apparently for getting rich, I guess](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-02-15/obama-honors-buffett-george-h-w-bush-with-medal-of-freedom))

[Companies](http://www.rockthecapital.com/02/20/top-1o-american-coal-producing-companies/) such Arch Coal Inc. (ACI), Peabody Energy (BTU), and Cloud Peak Energy (CLD) are all slated to reap HUGE profits after the Obama presidency and in the end, I think this is a concerted effort to snap up these companies at bargain basement prices.

What do you guys think? Have I connected any sort of dots here or do I have my tin-foil hat on too tight on this one? lol

**tl;dr:** President Barack Obama, along with the teachers unions &amp; bankers who helped fund his campaigns, is part of massive global plot under the guise of “climate change” to artificially lower the prices of coal companies by way of federal regulation in order to purchase them at very, very, very low prices. But whether or not you don’t believe my crackpot theory, there’s no denying that [coal will continue to play a VERY large role in the future.](http://instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/HutzlerPowderRiverBasinTestimony.pdf)",0

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-05/china-stocks-open-lower-as-regulator-seek-to-reassure-investors

Looks like the Chinese regulators are pulling all the stops to prop up the stock market, again. The Chinese market is stabilizing, at least for now.

Personally, I think they are just delaying the inevitable correction that should have happened back in August 2015. The equity market is still over-priced and doesn't reflect the economic reality and intrinsic values. Until a real correction happens, it will be difficult to move forward and more volatility are ahead.

As a side note, I have been monitoring the Chinese corporate bond payment defaults since October and it's [rising each month](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-17/china-ghost-town-developer-to-avert-default-as-xi-prevents-risks). At some point, the central government can't save everyone and need to accept the troughs of the business cycle. Failing businesses, even if they are state-owned, need to exit the market.

The real tipping point, in my opinion, will happen when a big enough company defaults and bond investors lose confidence, triggering a sell-off. ",12

My thesis on this company is that as the population ages, colonoscopy's are going to get more common and also this company is specializing with the use of profofol which is apparently an increasingly popular anesthesia product for colonoscopy's. Another reason why I'm considering to invest in this company is since they operate in Canada their profits will be larger because their revenue will be in USD.

Compared to every other investing subreddit out there, you guys are obviously dedicated to having fun. Thank you for helping me discover Robinhood, otherwise I'd never have even attempted to dip my toe in the water.

Here's what I bought at the opening bell: 

FCEL Limit Buy @ $5.87 (34% of portfolio)

F @ $13.99 (30% of portfolio)

TAO @ $19.44 (14% of portfolio)

ARDX @ $17.90 (13%)

OFS @ $11.63 (9%)

$FCEL is my YOLO because it's a total shitshow, down 69% for the year. Its industry sucks, but it outperforms its peers and investors within the industry will probably jump to FCEL's less-leaky ship, given its latest Pfizer deal.

The big mistakes from the opening bell were obviously $F and $ARDX. $TAO appears to be a decent outlet for the LOLfest that Chinese stocks are now, plus the repeal of the one-child policy makes real estate look pretty good there long-term. $OFS has a great (~11%) dividend payout.

Obviously, they expect the company to go bankrupt. They're not the only ones, as there's a large short interest in the stock as well. However, the amount of calls written have approached (or exceeded by now) the amount of outstanding float.

If the company doesn't go bankrupt, am I wrong in assuming this would have potential for a massive short squeeze?

16-01-05,3zmrg3,looking for investment advice,"So, I've been working on a number of things for reducing my current debt, and planning for my own retirement.  I'm 34 currently.

This really comes as the following:

1) matching my companies 401k max contribution (my 6% = their 3%)
2) increasing my paycheck contributions to make a max annual ROTH contribution
3) paying extra principal payments on my house, and car to finish those off in the next 3 years


The original reason to pay off the house was to then buy a new house and potentially use this one as a rental investment property.  So, I'd buy another house, move into the new house, do some uplifting of the current property and then rent it out.

But the more I think about it, I know that I don't personally want to deal with tenants, and I assume I'd still be financially responsible for tenant damages even if I handed it over to a property management firm.  

I guess I would like to know does it make any sense to continue down this path of owning multiple houses and having a rental agency handle it, and then still have to deal with house repairs? or should I just be happy with the house, and invest in other ways.

I'm starting to think that my best option would just be to open a vanguard account and just do personal EFT purchases, and grow my money that way.

1. How often do you review the performance of an adviser if you are long term investing?
2. Is this performance more a factor of overall volatility and market correction vs. PC's diversification strategy?
3. I'm considering switching to self management and using one of the ""lazy portfolio"" methods to invest the dollars that would have been paid as fees.  I currently have a Fidelity account and will likely move them there.  Dos the r/investing community see any issues with Fidelity as a whole?

As inventories of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus have piled up since they were launched last September, production will be scaled back to let dealers go through their current stock, the business daily reported.
The report prompted a 2.5 percent drop in Apple shares, which have lost about a quarter of their value from record highs in April, reflecting worries over slowing shipments. Shares in the mainly Asian makers of the iPhones' screens and chips were also sharply lower on Wednesday.

So I came across some companies that offer high dividend stocks.  Namely one company that has a dividend yield of 15.67% per year.

What am I missing here?  It seems like if I put 100 into a company, get a 15% dividend, and then the share price goes up 5% in 1 year, that's a 20% ROI.  Someone explain some more about this to me.",12

The Environmental Protection Agency said Monday that VW’s proposals to bring its diesels into compliance with emissions standards have been inadequate. At the same time, the Department of Justice sued, raising the specter of multibillion-dollar fines.
The message to VW: It’s going to take creative proposals to fix hundreds of thousands of cars, according to environmental lawyers and automotive analysts. It may take more money than expected to settle U.S. environmental claims. And even so, VW may yet face criminal charges, said people familiar with the U.S. investigation.

My thesis on this company is that as the population ages, colonoscopy's are going to get more common and also this company is specializing with the use of profofol which is apparently an increasingly popular anesthesia product for colonoscopy's. Another reason why I'm considering to invest in this company is since they operate in Canada their profits will be larger because their revenue will be in USD.

16-01-06,3zpjp3,Another 1-2% off today!,"The market is still over priced but it's nice to see the beginnings of a correction. I look at stock prices and every large cap that has dividends is priced at 20-25 P/E which is ridiculous. MSFT at 37 P/E??? What? Disney at 20+ with ESPN in the tank? No thanks. 

Commodities have tanked and money has flowed out of there into  non commodity names but even those are showing signs of weakness now. Q4 earnings will disappoint and then watch out for those high flying 2015 stocks that dont have any basis for their valuations. NFLX is a $40 stock, AMZN is at best $200-$300, CMG  should fall back into the 200s sooner than the others. 

There are great companies out there and some I've already mentioned but the pricing is way out of whack. Paying a 29 P/E for PG? How is that a good value and how do you expect to make money if you pay that sort of valuation for mature companies? VFC at 25.5 P/E? Where's the earnings growth going to have to be to support that kind of valuation and where will the market take these companies once the slowdown of the commodity sector and the overseas hits consumer spending. 

Just look at SWHC as confirmation of the market searching for anything to make money - up a ton in weeks based on simple higher earnings guidance and fear about gun control. The same thing happened in 2007 right before the 2008 crash where people were searching for potential value ANYWHERE cause everything else was over priced. It's not going to be quite as bad but it's certainly needed.

Cyclicals are the top of their cycle and the roller coaster is about to come down for a while. 

All aboard the cash train to keep some money on the side for when stocks are priced normally again but it'll take a 20-30% drop from current prices to make that happen for even the biggest and safest of names - not to mention the stock darlings whose valuations have no basis in reality. 

For us long term investors - this is a good thing - we're buying for 20 years out so we want prices to correct sooner than later so we don't have to pay outrageous valuations for years.

For short term traders - volatility is gonna be huge this year - big drops and then big short term corrections will be there but overall - the market needs that longer term correction to get values to reasonable levels. 

If you know anything about the market, you know that KO at 27 P/E, PEP at a P/E of 29.5! and MCD at 26 P/E makes no sense to buy. Great companies, awful prices. ",1

**Elite Pharmaceuticals Announces Positive Top-Line Results From A Pivotal Phase 3 Study For Abuse-Deterrent Opioid ELI-200
Meets Primary and Secondary Endpoints**
&gt; NORTHVALE, N.J., Oct. 21, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (""Elite"" or the ""Company"") (OTCBB:ELTP) today announced positive top-line results from the Phase 3 pivotal trial of its lead opioid abuse-deterrent candidate, ELI-200, for the treatment of moderate to severe pain.
&gt; 
&gt; The pivotal trial met its primary endpoint (p = 0.001), demonstrating statistical significance that the product provided pain relief following surgery in the treatment group using ELI-200 compared to the placebo group. Secondary endpoint results were consistent with primary findings and included safety measures. There were no serious adverse events or deaths related to ELI-200 reported during the conduct of the trial.
&gt; 
&gt; Elite intends to submit a New Drug Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for abuse-deterrent ELI-200 by year-end.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I am pleased with completing this important step in the commercialization of our first abuse-deterrent product, ELI-200,"" said Nasrat Hakim, President and Chief Executive Officer of Elite. ""The next significant step will be the submission of the NDA for ELI-200 which I expect to occur by year-end.""
&gt; 
&gt; About the Phase 3 ELI-200 Trial
&gt; 
&gt; The Phase 3 study evaluated safety and efficacy following dosing of ELI-200 for the treatment of moderate to severe pain following surgery.  It was a multicenter, randomized, multiple-dose, double blind, placebo-controlled, and parallel group study.  The clinical trial was conducted at five study sites in the United States which randomized 163 patients into the clinical study.
&gt; 
&gt; About Elite's Abuse Deterrent Technology
&gt; 
&gt; Elite's proprietary abuse deterrent technology, ART™, is a multi-particulate capsule which contains an opioid agonist in addition to naltrexone, an opioid antagonist used primarily in the management of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence.  When this product is taken as intended, the naltrexone is designed to pass through the body unreleased while the opioid agonist releases as intended providing therapeutic pain relief for which it is prescribed.  If the multi-particulate beads are crushed or dissolved, the opioid antagonist is designed to release and so block the effects of active opioid agonist.  The absorption of the naltrexone is intended to block the euphoria by preferentially binding to the same receptors in the brain as the opioid agonist and thereby reducing the incentive for abuse or misuse by recreational drug abusers.  Elite's pharmacological approach to abuse-deterrence can be applied to a wide range of opioids used today in pain management.
&gt; 
&gt; About Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
&gt; 
&gt; Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company which is developing a pipeline of proprietary pharmacological abuse-deterrent opioid products as well as niche generic products.  Elite specializes in oral sustained and controlled release drug products which have high barriers to entry.  Elite owns generic and OTC products which have been licensed to TAGI Pharma, Epic Pharma and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International.  Elite currently has eight commercial products  being sold, additional  approved products pending manufacturing site transfer and a product under review pending approval by the FDA.  Elite's lead pipeline products include abuse-deterrent opioids which utilize the Company's patented proprietary technology and a once-daily opioid.  These products include sustained release oral formulations of opioids for the treatment of chronic pain. These formulations are intended to address two major limitations of existing oral opioids: the provision of consistent relief of baseline pain levels and deterrence of potential opioid abuse.  Elite also provides contract manufacturing for Ascend Laboratories (a subsidiary of Alkem Laboratories Ltd.), and a Hong Kong based company for development of a branded product for the United States market and its territories.  Elite operates a GMP and DEA registered facility for research, development, and manufacturing located in Northvale, NJ.

1. Yes they are OTC
2. They have multiple products generating increasing year over year revenues
3. This is a real company. Tech is completely modular for all abuse deterrent drugs (simple two bead agonist/antagonist blend) 
4. People work there (wow!) and they have significantly increased their staff over the years
5. Yes their shares are bloated and they need to resolve this in the future, possibly R/S, but who knows
6. Since I mentioned it many moons ago pps has gone from .20 to .40
7. A theory is keeping it around .40 with a 10-1 RS would put them at $4 for NASDAQ and ~68 MM shares, allowing for tutes to garner some interest. I have no idea if that's what Nasrat plans as he has stated he would prefer to let pps grow organically
8. They still have a Lincoln Park Capital ATM (until we see how many shares are left in next 10Q), but  as of the past few months it hasn't affected pps
9. Price could already be factored in, but we will see in time
10. Because it's OTC it doesn't get affected by IBB/XBI/world news, etc like other bios
11. Bio market sucks right now
12. It could be a fun
13. I have no idea what will happen

I only make about 5 percent. I want to stop and put my money else where, where I can make more than 5 percent. I have had my LC account since July 2011 and I think it's time for a change.


   So getting to my big question is when I stop reinvesting in LC I will have about 120 bucks a month.

So I will get about 120 dollars a month until it adds up to 4500 roughly. Taking 3 years.


My first thought was vanguard ETF S&amp;P 500. I think it will be a better place for my money probably earning me more than 5 percent. I can also afford the 186 dollars a share. I can add about 50 to 80 dollars a month since I am getting the 120 from closing the LC account. The problem is, you need 3000 dollar minimum just to open the account.

The time frame for this new investment is not short term but not long term. I would like it to be easily liquid so if I needed it I could have it. But that isn't too important. It's okay if I can't touch the money for 5 years. Anything over 5 years I would have to think about it more, and    definitely nothing over 10. I would like this to be about a 5 year investment.

I am looking for slash want/need a place to invest my monthly amount at about or at least 5 percent or better. Is this possible without opening an account minimum? 

What would you do in my situation? Would you invest in something else? Would you stay in LC? I think I want something more liquid but that aspect isn't that important only somewhat. What should I look into? What should I be reading? Is it possible to make at least 5 percent with my circumstances? I would appreciate all advice, comments, regards, tips, and criticism.

Than you for you time and help!!!
I appreciate it lots!


TLDR - I am closing my lending club account which will give me a stream of 120 dollars a month for 3 years, that I want to invest at at-least 5 percent or better. Where should I put my money. Please help. Thanks.

The boglehead style of investing makes sense to me,  as I realize I am unlikely to have the time or wisdom to significantly outperform the market.  With that said,  I'm wondering why opting for a few relatively solid sector ETFs would not be a better option.  Specifically, VDC,  QQQ,  FDN,  and VHT.  The two tech heavy options are riskier as another dot com bubble could occur,  but the major tech companies at this point seem incredibly unlikely to fail, a long shot from the last crop.  For instance,  amazon, google,  apple,  these companies are as household as Kleenex,  and on the long term failure to grow seems the less likely bet.  Healthcare has a growing,  aging population, which has been the case for decades of course but the sector has still performed remarkably. Why wouldn't a mix of these etfs offer a somewhat more risky, but also potentially more rewarding investment? (I'm 27) And that may not even be entirely accurate, as VDC for example has been less volatile than VTI,  and lost less in the crash.

16-01-06,3zqrdu,"HTC Vive booth, huge potential","As HTC has said the price of the Vive will be more expensive than the Oculus (Oculus at 599$), I'm thinking investing in a VR booth is a great idea. Until the market can drive those ridicilous prices down, your average Joe won't be able to afford it, but I'm pretty sure he still wants to try one! 

Now, I've not done the math, and comparing prices where I live (Scandinavia) vs USA wouldn't be reasonable. 

**But** let's just say, 5$ for 5 min, 9$ for 10 min, and 17,5$ for 20 min would be fair, right? Here I've taken into account *some* of the costs like: 

* Renting a place to have the booth
* Cost of the Vive, PC, monitors, cables etc.
* Cost for beverages to the people that wait in line
* The extra people I'll have to hire

----------------------------------

So let's just say it explodes on day 1. Tons of people come in, it's open for 12 hours, and people are constantly in the booth. 
They also can't be inside for longer than 20 min (I'm still assuming they haven't got 100% rid of motion sickness). 

So for easy of math, we'll say they *all* took the 10 min for 9$. 

* 9x6 = 54 x 12 = 648$.

Let's also say half of them buy some soda, for 2,22$ (yeah that's cheap here actually) 

* 2,22$ x 27 = 60$. 

And someone probably bought some chocolate aswell so let's throw in another 20$. 

---------------------------------

That would amount up too 728$. And that's only with **one** booth. It would make the most sense to have at least two. So let's just double that number. 1456$ and since there's more people, more buy beverages and chocolate aswell. 

1500$ the first day earned, and since I was smart and had a friend/family member help me out, I only pay'em 50$ for a days work. They agree to work for another week aswell, if I pay'em 100$ per day. 

The next 4 days goes just aswell and people keep coming in as they've heard about the booth. So in 5 days I've earned 7500$ minus 450$ for the friend helping me out. That amounts to 7050$ which is about the same a Norwegian oil worker earns on an rig after 2 weeks. Only that I earned it in 5 days. 


----------------------------------

So what am I saying? There's potential. 

Or does this all sound like fantasy? I think it sounds about right, and I've got great confidence in VR. 

If anyone has anything to contribute with, that'd be great :) ",0

16-01-06,3zqvoe,Bouncing my beginner experience with Bitcoin off you guys. Maybe get some advice too.,"Preface

I've really enjoyed lurking through his sub for the past while. Most of the time you guys are speaking a language that I don't understand, but it's still fun to see how markets move and compare it to what you guys predicted.

Post

Last year around February, I got the bug up my butt to start having my bitcoin wallet deposit $25 worth of bitcoin each week indefinitely. I've followed the BC market closely, and was confident that I would either lose a little money, but essentially have a nice chunk of savings at the end of the year, or make a little bit of money and re-invest it.

Anywho, at the end of 2015, I had invested $1,100 USD into my bitcoin wallet, which is now valued at about $1,750. I've actually used bitcoin to pay for stuff more than I expected which has messed my numbers up a bit. 

I'm not an investor, I've written this money off in my budget so I'm willing to invest in something long term. I've read that Bitcoin is expected to rise significantly over the next year. Should I continue to deposit the $25 a week into my wallet? Or just sit on that $1,750 for another year and see where it goes? I'm also thinking of putting the money in other types of investments, but it seems like only investing &gt;$2k doesn't have enough benefits to outweigh the risks.  Last option would be to blow it all on hookers and coke. Your call. 

Any advice is helpful!",0

As of Sept 2015, Income was 4.5 billion. 3.7 billion GP. Expenses, 1 bn in R&amp;D, 1 bn in operating expenses... Net income 890 mil. 

So I'm thinking to myself, hmm, nice little business! I mean anyone in the universe would be happy with those numbers. 

13 billion in current assets. A surprising 18 billion in goodwill. 

Then I'm looking at the market cap. 220 BILLION. 

I mean yeah, it makes a nice GP% based on what it does, which I guess is selling ads and making the ability to check out ex girlfriends easy.

Edit: This is not meant to be the safest trade. However, the time horizon is over 1 year until expiration. Over the previous year AAPL has gone as high as $133.

Not wanting to have to manage the account every week or so, I also signed up with BlueVestment and automated the loan investments. And that's it, I didn't touch it for an entire year.

Now that is January again, I went back and looked at my portfolio. My annualized return is recorded as 9.44%, the about 1% ($50) of my loans are currently late. If I discount all of those 1% as going to default, that still gives me a pretty healthy return rate.

16-01-07,3ztaj1,Overconfident Investors,"This paper by Kent Daniel (Columbia, formerly Goldman Sachs, Northwestern) and David Hirshleifer (UC Irvine), two top researchers, talks about how overconfidence can lead to predictable stock returns and excessive trading. It's not very technical and is a very good read. As they discuss, overconfidence is a pervasive phenomenon that can have a big impact on the stock market.

""People tend to be overoptimistic about their life prospects (Weinstein 1980), and this optimism directly affects their financial decisions (Puri and Robinson 2007).""

""Overconfidence is a widespread psychological phenomenon ..., and is associated with a cluster of related effects. For example, it includes overplacement—overestimation of one’s rank in a population on some positive dimension—and overprecision—overestimation of the accuracy of one’s beliefs. An example is overestimation of one’s ability to predict future stock market returns. A cognitive process that helps support overconfident beliefs is self-attribution bias, in which people credit their own talents and abilities for past successes, while blaming their failures on bad luck.""

Redditors (especially the younger, male subsegment still in college or working in tech) should have no trouble recognizing themselves, that is, if they weren't so overconfident. ;)

16-01-06,3zqd2f,"Full Time Student: Outperformed the S&amp;P 500 &amp; Passively Earned Some Money. I Learned A Few Things","To preface, I am posting because I enjoy talking about money, and if in doing so, if it helps you, then it was worth it. Although I've helped some friends through college take control of their finances, have read books, and have some knowledge &amp; experience to know what I'm talking about, I'm by no means making a claim to be a professional. There are plenty of very smart &amp; knowledgeable on this sub-reddit who I can continue to learn from. 



I’ve noticed that a large source of confusion that some people have is buried in a pile of bullshit and web of misinformation when it comes to the topic of money. At the same time, I have found that there is a plethora of information that is of immense value, such as this sub &amp; online resources related to finance. The challenge that I've faced is sort through the crap, and finding out what works for ME. What works for me, will probably not work for YOU...but it might help you to see from a different perspective. 




First, [here is a photo of my brokerage account](http://imgur.com/nV69afd) performance (green line) vs the S&amp;P500 (blue line)



I started the year trading with a total sum around $20,000. In a year's worth of time, I doubled that amount by trading both stocks and options. 


Some might argue that it was just $20k, which is not as big a deal as when trading with $100k. Others might say that it was a lucky year, don’t let it get to your head. Think what you would like, but in my book, it sure beats having money rot in the bank. 



I was able to achieve these results by following market trends, blocking out noise, doing research, and utilizing derivative strategies combined with residual income positions when in cash. As my account grew during the year, I was able to take on more risk and shorten the holding duration of certain positions. And, It wasn’t just luck, as I did take on losses. What really helped was the discipline that I applied in taking many small wins. 




Here are some things that I learned:

-Discipline is money's pimp. If you practice exceptional discipline, you'll have more money that never sleeps. 

-Always have a plan, without it, your emotions will interfere. You will learn from your mistakes. 

-Leverage is an exceptionally powerful tool when paired with discipline. 

-It's a zero sum game, for every winner there will be a loser. 

-Education is key, you must continuously striving to learn more, even if it's in a completely different direction. 

-Listen to what people have to say, but apply your own judgement and do your homework. 

-You don't know what you don't know, so finding a mentor will accelerate your learning curve. 

-Consistency is key. If you can bring in small gains with reasonably controlled risk, over time it adds up. 

-Never think you know it all. 



Time it took:
Being a full time student, this number fluctuated depending on what was going on. I would average about 8 hours per week, this included research time, checking the markets, and reading. Since this is something I am passionate about, this was something I enjoyed spending my time on. 



Risk management:
Different people have different objectives and appetites for risk. For me, my account goal was to end the year above 8%, which I accomplished by limiting my losses, and having many small wins. Steep drops on the graph can be attributed to either poor discipline, or taking on greater levels of risk due to having more money on hand. 


YEAR 2016:
This year my goal is to again be above 8%. However, it will be interesting to see where this year takes us. 






Moving on to my bonus story of earning $3,952 passively while doing some good. Here is a screenshot of these earnings as [proof](http://imgur.com/gallery/NaVj7uj/new)




Those of you who are already familiar with [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/s2/6edbaceac4)
 will recognize where this is from. For those of you who have never heard of Fiverr, it's an online platform that allows individuals to offer various freelance gigs starting at $5. I am a huge fan of Fiverr, as it is easy to setup, reach buyers &amp; sellers quickly, and find a bunch of really talented people who are a pleasure to work with (when you find the right people). I was introduced to the platform as a buyer, but later decided to give selling a shot. Long story short, I found my niche gig (marketing related), slowly became bombarded with orders, found a hardworking English speaking couple in Venezuela that made ~$70 per month working full time jobs (crazy, current price of oil is going to make the situation over there even worse), trained them, outsourced all orders, handled customer interactions &amp; quality control, and split my profits. Was an awesome experience to learn about other people's lives, have some impact on their quality of life, and make some passive income to help max out my retirement account in the process. 





Thanks for reading, feel free to ask any question that you may have, offer your own insights, or PM me.  I'll crank out any responses in a timely manner, I enjoy talking about anything involving money.   ",0

It went down 5%. This morning, it got upgraded to outperform and the stock went up 6%, so I sold for a small loss of 1%. 

When you're looking for stocks to short, do you find them by combing through the charts, looking for breakouts to the downside? Do you look at earnings release dates and surmise from past earnings, economic data, etc. that the stock will likely continue to slide? Do you find them under the ""losers"" category on google finance? This last one concerns me, because these stocks have already dropped sometimes a massive amount (10-15%). ",11

16-01-06,3zrhud,Wall Street Journal: “Big-Cap Tech Stocks Are a Sucker Bet”,"I *highly* recommend reading the [entire article](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB952997047343478041). Key points:

- History has shown that whenever companies, no matter how great, get priced above 50 to 60 times earnings, buyer beware. A few stocks of the nifty-50 era subsequently outperformed the market, but in that venerated group no stock that sold above a 50 price-to-earnings ratio was able to match the S&amp;P 500 over the next quarter century.

- But many of today's investors are unfazed by history -- **and by the failure of any large-cap stock ever to justify, by its subsequent record, a P/E ratio anywhere near 100**.

- Supporters [and analysts] of these valuations point to their fantastic growth and rosy prospects. 

- But once a firm reaches big-cap status -- ranked in the top 50 by market value -- its ability to generate long-term double-digit earnings growth slows dramatically.

- What does all this mean? Our bifurcated market has been driven to an extreme not justified by any history. The excitement generated by the technology and communications revolution is fully justified, and there is no question that the firms leading the way are superior enterprises. But this doesn't automatically translate into increased shareholder values.

Oh, it is an article published at the peak of the DotCom bubble:

J. Siegel, “[Big-Cap Tech Stocks Are a Sucker Bet,](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB952997047343478041)” Wall Street Journal, March 14, 2000.

First of all they have a fantastic software division that is very undervalued. They focus on security software and for the upcoming year there is a new focus on IoT technology. They are working on their own and with Ford to implement this technology. 

On the phone side they're finally back with hardware. Their newest phone runs android with additional proprietary security and software features not available on any other phone. In addition they just announced today that they will be EXPANDING sales of the phone to the other three major wireless networks in the US (it was originally only on AT&amp;T). The company previously said that they would determine by the end of H1 16 whether or not they would stay in the hardware business, but expansion looks like a really good sign. 

Chen is going into his 3rd year. He originally started with a three year plan to turn the company around and so far he has produced. I'm sure this trend will continue.

To me, it seems like the best investment for the long term for someone who would not be interested in being an active investor, but instead a defensive investor. 

Looking at the expenses of the VOO, it seems like I would only be paying the brokerage commission for buying the stock (about $10 a trade), an MER of 0.05% (which seems decently low), as well as the tax conversion I would have to pay (since I am a Canadian). 

As for the MER, if I were to buy $5000 worth of the ETF, I would be paying Vanguard 0.05% of that $5000 ($2.50) per year, even if VOO were to drop that year. Do I stand correct on this?

There would also be the expense of inflation (averaging about 3% per year, I believe).

16-01-07,3ztv3p,Wash sale in non-taxable accounts,"So, I understand I can't sell a stock in a taxable account for a loss, then turn around and buy it again in an IRA in 30 days. I couldn't claim the losses. 

But how about selling for a loss in a non-taxable account then buying it in the same non-taxable account in less than 30 days. There is no tax benefit, so it should follow that there is no penalty and the wash rule shouldn't apply. 

So the scenario would be hitting a stop loss in a non taxable account, then when I think the ""bottom"" is hit and the fundamentals are still sound buying it back. Seems to me there should be nothing wrong with that. 

Am I missing anything?",2

16-01-06,3zs0r5,How and why are shares of company stock funds in company 401(k) of a significant different value than the stock price of that company?,"I noticed the stock fund of my company in a 401(k) is around 60-ish $ per share. The stock fund says it comprises 99.9% of the company stocks. However, the stock price of that same company is in the low 100$'s per share. 

What is the rationale for these differing prices? Would it not be convenient to simply let the price per share of the fund be same as the stock price? 


Edit: Here are some of the companies that I know of:

Yelp is totally in the shitter, and the only thing keeping its price from collapsing is the prospect of a buyout by another company.  But they have been whoring themselves out to try and find somebody to buy them, leading me to believe any buyout wouldn't come at much of a premium.  Also, why would a company buy them now if their value has been falling pretty steadily?  Don't see much upside risk here.

Cornerstone and Cogent are highly valued tech companies with substantial debt that aren't yet profitable.  Cornerstone has 226 mil in debt compared to a 280 mil cash position, with only 33 mil in cash coming in last year.  Official numbers for 2015 aren't out yet, but I'd guess they took in about $50 mil based on revenue growth numbers.  Not a great spot for a growing company to be in as interest rates rise.  EPS 2016 estimate on TDA is .02, with a range of -.11 to .11.  That's a best case estimate forward P/E of 297.

Cogent is in a similar spot...has $288 mil in cash compared to $611 mil (!) in debt, with only $73 mil coming in last year.  According to TDA data, their forward P/E is 73 for 2016. 

I know, I know, fundamentals are for r/investing.  But I think these 3 are due to fall.  So, am I missing something about any of these?

It's estimated it does ~$6.5b in net revenue (not gross), and I'd wager has **very** high margins (maybe 40% net). But let's be really conservative anyway, and say the net margin is only 20%. We'd still be pulling home $1.3b/year free and clear. 

While a slowdown in growth alarms the WSJ for some reason:

&gt;Though the App Store is growing at an impressive clip, there are signs of slowing growth. The company had said App Store billings grew 50% in 2014, but Apple’s figures suggest that sales growth fell to about 40% in 2015.

How many standalone $6b/yr companies have grown at 40% this year? One company you might have heard of called Netflix grew at about half that with *slightly* more in revenue, but with **way** worse margins. Probably around 90% worse in fact.  

So please tell me why Netflix is a better investment than Apple today, because I also get the iPhone, iPad, Mac, AppleTV, Apple Watch businesses too... and all of them are a shitload more profitable than Netflix.

TetraLogic Pharmaceuticals Announces Data on Lead Clinical Programs

Birinapant Shows No Activity in Randomized Phase 2 MDS Study

SHAPE Shows Clinical Benefit in Randomized Phase 2 CTCL Study

MALVERN, Pa., Jan. 06, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TetraLogic Pharmaceuticals Corporation (TLOG), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel small molecule therapeutics in oncology and infectious diseases, today announced the results of the interim analyses of two clinical studies. 

In a placebo controlled Phase 2 study of birinapant co-administered with azacitidine in first line higher risk patients suffering from myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), birinapant did not demonstrate any clinical benefit over placebo on the primary endpoint of response rate after four months of therapy and met the bounds for futility.  This interim analysis included the first 62 patients randomized in the trial.  This study will now be terminated.

TetraLogic has undertaken an interim analysis of a randomized Phase 2 clinical study of SHAPE, the company's proprietary topical HDAC inhibitor.  The clinical trial was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of three different dosing regimens of SHAPE in patients suffering from earlier stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).  All patients in the study had received prior therapy either in the form of topical steroids, UV light therapy, topical nitrogen mustard, or some other agent.  Twenty-eight of 34 patients were evaluable for response at the 6 month time point.  After six months of treatment, 8 of 34 patients exhibited a response to treatment as assessed by CAILS, the primary endpoint, and a further 18 had stable disease.  Using the mSWAT, a secondary endpoint in the study, 11 of 34 patients responded and a further 14 patients had stable disease at the 6 month endpoint. 

SHAPE also showed improvement in pruritus (itch), a significant symptom associated with CTCL.  Thirty-eight percent of patients demonstrated a clinically meaningful decrease in pruritus during the study as measured by a Visual Analog Scale.  The drug was well tolerated by patients in the study.  The 60 patient study is now fully enrolled, and the company expects that final results will be available in mid-2016.

“Whilst the results of the birinapant study in MDS are disappointing, the results we achieved with SHAPE provide an interesting product profile with activity observed on both the CAILS and mSWAT endpoints and the potential to reduce pruritus, one of the more difficult symptoms to treat in CTCL,” said J. Kevin Buchi, TetraLogic CEO.  “We are exploring our strategic alternatives based upon the results seen in these studies.”

* VANGUARD VXC	2,396.80 **16.40%**

I plan to contribute aggressively, is there anything I should know about this distribution? Is it bad? I was thinking of going straight for 10k in VUN so I could qualify for admiral shares. Is that the wisest course of action?

My instinct is to sell the lot and reinvest the £450 in one new stock to consolidate and try to grow again from there. One of the stocks I bought at 25p fell to 6p but now seems to be fluctuating around 10p. A small part of me is tempted to reinvest the £450 back into this stock and hope that a small rise to even 13-15p will then begin my growth again (I still believe in the company and what it sells).

*Macy's* announced the closing of 36 stores in 2016.  The company also announced a significant layoff initiative of around 4,500 positions that will save around $400 mm in SG&amp;A.  The company is also exploring monetizing some or all of its owned real estate portfolio.
 

*JC Penney (JCP)*  announced that it generated SSS of 3.9% for the holiday period and reaffirmed full year EBITDA guidance of $645 mm. 
 

*Marks &amp; Spencer's* Chief Executive Officer Marc Bolland will step down after failing to revive clothing sales in almost six years at the British retailing bellwether.
 

*L Brands (LB)* announced December SSS increased 8% - topping consensus estimates of 3.9%.
 

*Conn's (CONN)* announced that December Product SSS declined 5.9%.
 

*Costco (COST)* announced SSS in the US increased 3% for both the 5 week and 18 week periods ending Janyary3, 2016. This missed consensus estimates. 
 

*Zumiez* raised Q4 guidance despite experienced a SSS decline of 11% in Q4 - it expected a decline of .14%-16%.  
 

*Fred's* December SSS increased 2.4% - exceeding consensus estimates of 1.9%.
 

*Gilt Groupe* agreed to be acquired by Hudson's Bay for $250 million in cash.
 

*The Children's Place* expects Q4 SSS to be an increase of 6%-7% - above prior levels.  The company alsoraised Q4 earnings guidance. 
 

*Wal -Mart (WMT)* announced that it will close some of its stores in Brazil. 
 
 
*IBM* announced a deal with sports and fitness retailer Under Armour Inc. to use machine learning technology from Watson and showed off an application for diabetic care developed with the supercomputer's data, highlighting the company's effort to expand Watson's capabilities for the health-care industry.
 

*Chipoltle (CMG)* Federal authorities are conducting a criminal probe tied to an outbreak of foodborne disease at one of Chipotle Mexican Grill's restaurants last year, the company said, raising the stakes in a series of such outbreaks that have battered Chipotle's sales

16-01-07,3zvt44,Trying to understand my inverse stock picks,"First off: I did something stupid last Aug/Sept. I know it was stupid and I've come to terms with that. I was 100% sure we were going into a big correction similar to 2011, so I dumped all my long term stocks, and bought big into inverses. I've since lost 20-25% of my portfolio, but this week has gotten me back to 12% down...not bad...trying to figure out my relief point to pull out and wait in bonds or something more secure long term but still, having trouble understanding two of my stocks:

CHAD: The investment seeks daily investment results of 100% of the inverse of the performance of the CSI 300 Index.
The CSI 300 index is currently down 6.8% on the day but CHAD is only up 1.8%. If it's 100% inverse of something that's down 6.8%, shouldn't it go up 6.8%? 

YANG: The investment seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 300% of the inverse (or opposite) of the performance of the FTSE China 50 Index.

YANG is up 4% today, but the FTSE China 50 is down 4.11%, shouldn't YANG, at 300%, be up 12%?

My other american based picks SDS, FAZ, respond properly to the inverses that I've seen. I know China is a shit show of nonsense right now...but i didn't think it would affect my inverses this way.",5

I was interested in your opinions on Nvidia Corp (NVDA) ? .

Personally I'm a big believer in the Occulus Rift . I believe its use in gaming as well as Porn (no really) will be huge.

The system requirements of the occulus rift are very demanding requiring a high end graphics card which Nvidia (as well as AMD) dominate the market.

Nvidia has partnered up with PC and notebook manufactures to have ""VR"" ready pc's and laptops to make it easier for consumers to select a powerful enough device.

""The graphics card shouldn't be less powerful than the Nvidia GTX 970 or the AMD R9290"" to quote

Start an office pool, collect $20 from each person for powerball tickets and send them a long list of the numbers before the drawing in an excel sheet. When they don't win, you get to keep the entire amount of money. 

If they do win (so extremely unlikely), you just have to explain to them that you are a scumbag and didnt actually buy any tickets and leave town. Much like a short position, you stand to gain an easy 100% but could lose unlimited amounts of money.

16-01-07,3zsqla,Playing the downside: inverse ETF discussion.,"This is a discussion for people like myself who accept the premise that the market will be going to hell for the next two years. The primary reasons for this is heightening lending interest rates will make it less feasible for companies to buy back stocks infinitely and the lack of consumer spending. Consumer spending IMO will decline for several reasons (1) many large companies have already announced they will be cutting the workforce (2) as unemployment rises, companies have more leverage to lower worker's wages (3) the motivation to automate/mechanize labor will increase with declining revenues (4) boomers are retiring and the debt ridden mileniels can't replace them as spenders. Basically all this shit is going to hit the fan within the next year or two and I expect most companies to underperform. That said, how can the short side of this be played in a Robinhood friendly way?

* BZQ - Brazil is basically going to face its worst recession yet. Brazilian companies are loaded with debt and there is no Brazilian middle class to prop up the economy.

* SMN - As sales globally decline, the demand for basic materials will also decline. Another more subtle factor that will cause the decline of basic materials is mechanization. As the extraction for basic materials becomes more automated and less expensive, they will be made in a large surplus and thus destroy their pricing. Within a single country scarcity of basic materials can be artificially achieved to prop up their prices, but in a global economy this would require the agreement of all basic material producers which simply won't happen.

* CMD - Commodities basically goes hand and hand with basic materials. Commodity prices have been so jacked up for the last several years and with wages still being stagnant there is simply no way manufacturers can continue to raise prices.

* BOM - Same rational as basic materials. Shorting base metals.

Any other suggestions?",5

It appears that my windfall will continue. No one won the powerball last night and the jackpot is going to grow again. When i walked into the office this morning everyone was like ""MAN HEAPSPRAY no one won last night we should organize a COMPANY WIDE powerball pool""

So im 'reinvesting' the '9 dollars' we 'won' from the last time and starting a company wide pool today which should get me about $2,400 dollars worth of tickets.

I already have an excel spreadsheet setup to generate random numbers that fit the same numbering scheme as the powerball numbers, so all i have to do is create ~1,200 rows. 

Before anyone starts complaining about fraud, I'll remind you that this is EXACTLY what AIG did when insuring against the derivatives market during the financial crash, and no one went to prison there, so i have some outs if this all goes wrong.

In true WSB fashion, when i earn the $2,400 plus the $600 from last time, i will open a robinhood account and put all $3,000 dollars into AMD stock.

AMZN (Bought 5 shares at $487, sold at $669 in December) = This is the only stock that I purchased which I have sold since I started. After the profit I made with AMZN I decided that I made enough off of it and sold it and have continued to track it anyway as a learning experience. I am debating buying back into it if it falls below $615, (currently at 623)

DIS (Bought 5 shares at $108, currently down to $99)

ATVI (Bought 28 shares at $25 in May, currently up to $36, but has been falling recently)

GE (Bought 25 shares at $25 in September, currently up to $29.63 but has been falling recently)

NTDOY (Bought 10 shares at 18.10, Currently at $16)

SONY (Bought 25 Shates at 23.30, Currently at 23.45)

I also have the following Mutual/Index/ETFs. These were the first things I purchased but I do not remember the amount

VUN (Vanguard US total Market ETF) - 20 Shares - Up $2

VTI - Vanguard TTL STK MRTKT ETF - 8 Shares, down $18

VGT - Vanguard Info Tech ETF - 10 Shares, up $33

TBD900 - TD CDN INDX -E (This one has been doing really bad for me ever since i purchased it, wondering if I should sell or hold for long term) 86 Shares = Down $266

TBD902 - 42 Shares = Up 7.30
 
CIB506 (CIBC R) = 33 shares, down 35$

I'm thinking about selling all of TBD900, TBD902 and CIB506. The Canadian economy seems to be pretty weak and there does not seem to be any indicators that it will improve this year. Maybe invest in something like Google, AAPL, Facebook instead and get back into CDN funds once the economy begins to show signs of improvement. Thoughts?

However, the fundamentals of the market are finally catching up to us as most people start seeing the issues in China, ridiculously low commodity pricing and  soon lower than expected Q4 earnings in the US as a symptom of an economy that has slowed and will continue to slow lowering demand across the board.

The stock market won't be on sale until we see where Q4/Q1 earnings are coming in and what companies start saying about 2016. We're only down about 5% including today which is far from where we need to be to correct pricing. ",28

16-01-07,3zszyo,Which industries are negatively affected by falling oil prices?,"I'm no economist, but I feel like I've a reasonable understanding of how rising oil prices negatively impact certain industries and economies
(ie direct impact on shipping and therefore distribution costs, overall energy costs, aswell as impacting countries which import the majority of their oil, such as Japan and perhaps China).

What I struggle to understand is which industries are *negatively* impacted by falling oil prices.

Can anyone explain this, or even better recommend some reading material which delves into it?

16-01-07,3zw2mr,"History and approach to ""proxy investing""","It was noted in a previous thread that someone was taking a position in water by investing in almond farms in California.

https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2fq1uo/dr_michael_burry_and_almond_farms/?

From what I understand, since there is no way to invest directly in water as a commodity, making an investment in almond farms is essentially a proxy bet on the long term value of water rising (as the farms require a ton of water)? I still don't understand this fully, but believe that's the basic idea.

Anyway, two questions:

- What is this kind of investment strategy/approach called? Proxy investing?
- Are there any other more common/well-known/famous examples of folks doing this type of investing technique? Basically, someone who had a unique insight into a commodity and had to come up with a creative way to take a position in it?

Some of its heavy hitter allocations are
SU @24%
CNQ @18%
CVE @ 8%
=50% 
remaining is smaller companies at about 2% or less. 

I'm assuming that - IF the entire canadian energy sector gets wiped out due to extremely low oil prices, this ETF will go to shit and lose probably half its value.  I don't know what the likelihood of this happening is. I think that's a worse case scenario.

So this trade will be a 100% loss or gain type of trade. 

I will commit 5% total portfolio to this trade broken down over 5/6 entries. Reassess situation once 50% of this has been committed. 

Expected pivot points to where entry will be made. 
10.00
9.50
8.50
7.50
6.50
5.50
3.50
1.50
0.50

Depending on where it sits next friday, sell an ITM put nearest the underlying price, with expectation of being put shares. Same time, sell a front month call of same or slightly OTM strike. 

If trade ends up profitable - good. 

If trade continues downward - wait until next pivot point, and repeat. Continue to lower cost basis of trades.

Repeat until 5% max risk is reached. 

What do you guys think?

Unfortunately I'm not set up (nor qualified) to do literal short selling of stocks, but I was wondering what were some good companies, funds, or plays that could be made to accomplish the general goal of inversely playing the housing market.

My ideas so far :

Puts on homebuilders. Question is how far out and which ones? I'd like to find some with shaky fundamentals.

Puts on home related retailers. Home Depot, Lowes, etc. Seems riskier because they would be one of the last stops if the housing market slowed. Probably beyond my capabilities to time correctly.

Puts on mortgage related businesses. Would have to do research to find out who the key players are. Anyone have any ideas on where to start here? Would also need a healthy options market.

Any other ideas on strategies or companies to look at? Are there any inverse housing market etfs that don't reset daily?

Additionally, when the VIX is up and stocks are plummeting, are there any measures to maximize value of short options plays? If everyone is going the same way as me, should I just wait, or are there ways to find values in the short options market even with a high VIX?

16-01-07,3zwgb6,2 ETFs and 1 ETN everyone here should consider,"Hi r/investing,

Professional portfolio manager here

As I have been doing research and putting a plan together for 2016, I have come across 2 ETFs and an ETN that would make sense for a lot of people here.

The are IEFA, IEMG, and MLPI.

IEFA and IEMG are two iShares ETFs that utilize the IMI indexes for International Developed and Emerging Markets. These differ from the traditional indexes by growing the investable universe by 15% and including small cap companies as well. For both indexes, this change has resulted in slightly better returns with less volatility.  IEFA has returned 3.3% annualized these past 3 years vs. 2.55% EFA; IEMG is -8.7% annualized over 3 years vs. -10% for EEM. So, if you are looking for a low cost, tax efficient way to get full exposure to International Developed and Emerging Markets, these are very good choices. 

MLPI is an ETN that tracks the performance of a basket of energy-oriented master limited partnerships. MLPs are limited partnerships that trade with the liquidity of public companies. With the energy sector taking such a beating, MLPI currently has a yield of 7.4%. For those of you looking to enter/overweight the energy space, this is a great vehicle. The 7.4% is taxed as ordinary income, so for those on this sub with high incomes, better to invest directly in the MLPs.

16-01-07,3zvntt,[Update] WSB Capital Fund I,"Roughly two months ago, a few people floated the idea of starting a hedge fund together here on wsb. After a lot of hard work from several people, we finally have something to show for our work. It turns out a hedge fund was not a feasible option and did not align well with the stated goals of the venture. After consulting with several attorneys and industry professionals, we decide a private offering for detailed investment strategies would be the best option.  The group decided on two different strategies that will need to be in two separate funds. Before we continue with the formation of entities we need to gauge initial investor interest. 

WSB Capital Fund I will be a value-add/opportunistic real estate fund. The proposed real estate fund will invest in the top US real estate markets and target investments that have a value-add or opportunistic component. Preliminary investor materials for this fund and strategy are available for distribution.  WSB Capital Fund I will be open to accredited investors only. If you feel like you meet the definition of an accredited investor and would like to know more about WSB Capital Fund I, please reach out to me here.   

WSB Capital Fund II will be an algo trading strategy. The materials for this strategy are still being prepared as the strategy is considerably more mechanically complex than real estate investments. At this time, back tests for the strategy have been completed and initial written drafts of the strategy are well underway. Stay tuned for future updates on the status of WSB Capital Fund II.",20

I had been invested in the market since 2012, but it wasn't until 2013 that I started to follow the market on a daily basis. 

I panicked too, but didn't sell anything. I just kept an eye on it. I was confident my picks would eventually come out on top. And some of them did. I attribute it to a mixture of luck and skill, but mostly luck. 

It sucks to be in the red, to see your unrealized gains trend downwards every single day. But that's the nature of investing. If you can't stomach a measly -2% or -5% hit to your portfolio, wait until a black swan comes out and wipes your portfolio by -40%. If you panic about small movements, a big movement is likely to give you a heart attack. 

My personal greatest mistake when it comes to these downturns is that I never have enough money on hand to buy what I've been researching. I have around $7,000 to play with right now, but I have trouble narrowing down my picks. I have too many ideas, and not enough skill to narrow them down. Might just go for V if it falls below $70, that's my top one right now. 

In fact, the best bargains for January 2016 might be found next week. The market will likely rally, unless there is even more bad news from China and the rest of the world. ",2

Am I wrong in assuming that an asset that saves you money is still an asset and not a liability? Of course, if the house breaks down, repairs might cost money, but that is a risk for any asset. Owning a business is both an asset and a liability.

US corporate profits are forecasted lower, and bankruptcies are forecasted higher. Divergence between high yield bond returns and stock returns are growing and will eventually converge. Oil bottomed about a year before the 2008 financial crisis and spiked leading to Q3 of '07, oil is bottoming now and will spike again. Check out www.tradingeconomics.com if you want to check these claims. Geopolitical issues are a blaming point for media and not as heavily correlated with markets as people tend to believe. Recession and market corrections are cyclical, they repeat themselves throughout history. We've been bull for almost a decade and the time is coming. Keep your heads through this thing, be skeptical of all the frenzied news out there and play both sides of the trade. ",2
16-01-07,3zx21u,What do you guys think about Pfizer going forward post Allergan merger? $PFE,"""Analysts’ estimates show an EPS of ~$2.19 for 2015 and a rise in EPS to ~$2.37 for 2016 and ~$2.65 for 2017. The revenues are estimated to fall by ~2.2% for 2015. Meanwhile, estimates show a rise of over 8.5% in revenues for 2016 and a further rise of ~5.0% in revenues for 2017 due to the growth of revenues from oncology and alliances.

The gross margin is expected to improve from 80.7% in 2014 to 81.2% in 2015 but is projected to fall to ~78.6% in 2016 and ~78.8% in 2017. The rise in 2015 is due to the lower cost of sales. On the other hand, the operating profit margin is expected to rise to ~37.0% in 2015 from 26.8% in 2014. It’s further expected to improve to ~38.3% in 2016 and ~39.3% in 2017. The rise in operating margin is due to an operational fall in R&amp;D (research and development) expenses as a result of lower clinical spends for Prevnar 13, Trumenba, and certain oncology drugs.""

16-01-08,3zyntz,College Student Interested In Investing,"Hello all! I'm currently in my second year of college as an engineer. Of late, I've been growing an interest in stock investing and personal finance. I've been reading and watching numerous posts and videos on the subject and am half way through the Khan academy videos posted here last week.
I thought for starters it would be alright to invest in small penny stocks on the app Acorn. However, as I continue to research my questions keep growing. So here are a couple of my questions.

* How am I doing so far? Are penny stocks the right way to go? I've read many arguments for and against them.

* If Penny stocks are not a good Idea what would you suggest?

* Is Acorn a good idea? Again I have heard both sides of the argument. I am a college student so I cannot not simply throw down $1000 right into my account. I thought with an app like acorn I can start with a small account of $50+ and work my way up slowly with penny stocks. I originally started with TD Ameritrade but disliked there $10 per trade price. I have also been considering robin hood.

* What are stock market strategies? I've been hearing about them but have not researched too much reading on them.

* How often do I have to keep track of (Penny) stocks? How often do they get updated?

Please any and all advice would be greatly appreciated.",1

16-01-07,3zwxmn,"Why is VOO's Dividend Yield Higher than VFV's?","I am wondering, since I am a Canadian, and I am considering which is the better investment. 

As I understand, they both follow the S&amp;P 500, whereas VFV just buys shares of VOO with Canadian dollars. So, the price of VFV is reflected in terms of CDN to US dollars, which is why it appears to be going up so much in the last 3 years (~20% on average I believe). 

If I were to buy VOO shares from Canada, using my TFSA, I would have to pay the bank's exchange fee (which is about 2%), on top of the currency conversion. So, VFV seems like the better deal in this respect, since I am not paying that 2%.

However, the dividend yield of the two ETFs are totally different (VOO is 2.2% and VFV is 1.68%), including the Management Expense Ratio [or MER] (VOO is 0.05% and VFV is 0.08%). I also realize that there is a 15% tax you have to pay on VOO's dividends when they come into your TFSA, which means the dividend yield for VOO would really be (2.2% - (0.15*2.2) = 1.87%). So, given that VOO has the better dividend yield and a cheaper MER, but has that extra 2% cost up front, which do you think would be the better deal - VFV or VOO?

EDIT: Just did some math - if I had $6000 (minus 2% = $5880) invested in VOO (theoretically growing at 8% per year) and waited 45 years, it would grow to $187,692.24.
If I had $6000 invested into VFV (theoretically growing at 8% per year, minus the weaker dividend difference and higher MER (adding up to 0.22%) = 7.78%) for 45 years, it would grow to $174,730.74. 

So, it appears that VOO would be better for the long term. But, this is based on the idea that the MER and dividend yields would stay the same. However, I am not sure if this is the case (e.g., perhaps VOO's dividend will be lower than VFV's later on).",8

At some point I thought I was seeing some unique headlines, so I started saving them. I didn't get all the good ones (somehow didn't think to save the Lehman bankruptcy), but enough to look back on market sentiment at the time. With so many people comparing today's markets to 2008, I think this is a good time to reflect on it.

From a US perspective, this doesn't look or feel like a repeat to me. I haven't seen anything that would say the US economy is in trouble. I think it's more likely a reversion to the mean. We far overshot the appropriate valuations, and we're just getting back to those levels. The Fed's actions certainly influenced stock prices, and they had to start letting things to back to normal at some point. Everything is gonna be fine (unless you bought something that was way above an appropriate valuation, then you're probably screwed, sorry).

China is a big deal, but people who are smarter than me have been calling them out for a long time (since at least 2005). Their infrastructure spending and FX controls were unsustainable, and a huge part of last year's market rise came from new, inexperienced investors entering the market. This affects commodity demand, but not much else. I think China's weakness is a net positive for the US.

Personally, I love it when stocks go down. It's the part of the rollercoaster where everybody screams. You get to see who was making foolish trades and who actually knows what they're doing. I've been waiting for this for a long time. Stocks might finally be going on sale again.

16-01-08,3zzadu,US Market 2016 predictions and strategy,"The plan: Based on the reasons noted in the links, there is good reason to believe that the bull market has ended and is headed for a sharp correct back to pre-QE levels, estimating about a 60% decrease. 

**Step 1:** The S&amp;P 500 will experience a sizable correction

**Step 2:** After what I think will be about an initial 20% correction, the Fed will probably do all of the following things: NIRP (negative interest rate policy), QE4 (which will be the last hurrah of asset purchases, using all of the fire power they have), and unleash helicopter money (which means giving a tax-free payout to citizens to help increase spending). As noted here (http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-01-05/we-frontloaded-tremendous-market-rally-former-fed-president-admits-warns-no-ammo-lef) the former Dallas Fed President believes that the Fed has no more real ammo left to sustain the current market environment.

- Regarding helicopter money, you can see that this is a very real possibility with Finland already utilizing this tactic (http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-12-06/it-begins-desperate-finland-set-unleash-helicopter-money-drop-all-citizens) and Citigroup's Chief Economist saying that this is a valid strategy (http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-08-29/citigroup-chief-economist-thinks-only-helicopter-money-can-save-world-now). The only problem is that 2/3 of American's don't have any savings (http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-01-07/sad-state-affairs-two-thirds-americans-have-no-emergency-savings), so why the heck would people actually spend this money when they have no savings and are neck deep in debt. 

**Step 3:** The real bear market starts after these last ditch efforts by the Fed. This is when you hedge your 80% stock allocation by purchasing TVIX -- a 2x leveraged ETF that tracks volatility -- with your 20% in cash. Conservatively, I think TVIX will increase by at least 400% from the peak of the Fed’s final intervention. By looking at the following 6 month historical chart of TVIX (http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=TVIX+Interactive#{""range"":""6mo"",""allowChartStacking"":true}), you can see that the stock increased by almost 400% during the August event when markets limited down and fell about 7% in a span of five trading days.

Not to say that there isn’t risk in this trade which has such swift swing movements, but in my opinion, this is the perfect hedge by replacing a potential wipe out of your 80% in stocks with a potential gain of 400% with TVIX. 

I also believe the buy-and-hold approach that has been really successful for you is a thing of the past. I think this next recession will mark the end of Central Bank intervention. By looking at the historical S&amp;P 500 chart, I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the stock market exponentially increased right around the time when the Fed started expanding their balance sheet and intervened in the market. Of course, there are other reasons for these increases (e.g. innovation creating high growth revenue streams). But, to give an example, instead of letting the Dot-com bubble naturally pop they decided to intervene making the subsequent crash that much worse.

Here are several other articles that should be helpful when you consider this plan:

- Retail investors (you and me) are always the ones that are crippled during recessions while the “smart” money gets to the sidelines, invests in volatility / gold, shorts the market, etc. (http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-12-30/next-time-your-financial-advisor-tells-you-buy-stocks-show-them-chart). Here is another article from Bank of America saying “go long cash and volatility” http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-01-07/three-reasons-why-bank-america-just-said-go-long-cash-volatility 

- Here is the timing of the recession. Every single recession has happened 12-18 months after the peak in corporate profit margins and we’re currently at 16 months. http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-12-02/timing-drop-equities-peak-12-18-months-after-peak-margins-we-are-now-15-months-after

    http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-11-06/labor-participation-rate-remains-37-year-low-945-million-remains-outside-labor-force 

- In addition to the Fed, corporate buyback programs have been another big reason why stocks haven’t fallen...yet http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-05-10/chart-day-record-stock-buybacks-hit-escape-velocity. Of course, in addition to CEO compensation plans being based on stock prices, the Fed’s Zero Interest Rate Policy is to blame for record corporate stock buybacks by giving them incredibly cheap loans. Now it’s ending (http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-11-07/why-stock-buyback-spree-may-be-ending) so how many corporations, not just banks, will have to be bailed out this time?


It appears that we’re already in a recession...the Fed and corporate buyback programs are the only things keeping the stock market afloat. So what happens when the bubble pops? Consumers start spending even less, companies revenues decrease, they have to cut costs by laying people off to increase their profit margin, thus causing people to have no source of income (they already have no savings), so they default on their auto loans, can’t pay off their student loans, etc. etc. 

It’s going to get ugly and I unfortunately think it’s going to be worse than ‘08. Recessions are supposed to be an opportunity for reform. If only we actually learned our lessons and didn’t sacrifice everything for the fear of short term pain.",3

16-01-08,3zzfc5,Everyone here who wants to be way ahead of the curve needs to know about Cryptonote.,"In 2009, a dweebish computer program which could create digital money rose up from the depths and became world famous.  It was launched anonymously and no one is still sure who created it, but it doesn't matter: it's open source.  You don't need to trust anyone and that's the beauty of it: it was the first trustless digital money.  
  
These nerdy tokens went from a few cents each to hundreds of dollars each, making many people instantly wealthy.  
  
You already know these tokens as **Bitcoins** and as frustrated as you may be at the notion, the world is waking up to the idea of borderless digital money that no one controls.  
  
*But Bitcoin is not private.*  It also has no current method inside it to scale.  
  
This means that it is highly likely that going forward Bitcoin becomes a large and public international settlement system, and not necessarily the digital money messiah everyone had hoped.  That doesn't mean it won't be valuable (it will), but just that it won't be the only serious cryptocurrency in the world.  
  
I humbly suggest you educate yourself on a new protocol that came out in 2014 called **Cryptonote**.  It also was launched anonymously, is open source, and uses some of the most advanced mathematics our species has ever wielded.  
  
Why is it important?  It adds privacy at the protocol layer through transaction mixing via something called 'cryptographic ring signatures'.  This means that not only are your transactions untraceable but also that your holdings are immune from public scrutiny too.  I don't think I need to explain why having strong mathematical  privacy by default is superior.   
  
It also scales using an adaptive blocksize limit so it totally sidesteps all current transaction limitations the Bitcoin network has.  
  
Finally, the two largest Cryptonote implementations both incorporate trailing emissions meaning *they are not deflationary.*. There will always be new currency left to compete for and mint by aspiring computers.  
  
--------    
  
But both are very new, and very risky.  In order for a financial universe to arise from nothing and become large enough to handle transactions on the order of billions of dollars, it must undergo several exponential growth cycles (as Bitcoin has done).  This necessary evil also creates opportunity for those who see the potential early to make some well placed high-risk longshots.  If you find the next big financial network early, you have a chance to become the next group to find themselves riding it's waves into extreme wealth.  
  
Please take some time to look into Cryptonote implementations, including Monero (/r/Monero), because one or more will likely be a massive global financial network by the 2020s.  The Monero network might only be worth a paltry few million dollars today, but this is going to change dramatically in time.  One alternative I am heavily involved with is called Aeon, but it is even smaller than Monero.  Another is called Boolberry.  
  
Happy reading, and I hope you'll take the time to get ahead of the curve.  It's not popular yet, but the technology is such a quantum leap ahead of anything else being used I would be surprised if it doesn't eventually dominate.  These things just take time.  ",0

I wanted to get some help on how you felt about the plan I have set in place.  Currently, I have just under $30k worth of debt from credit cards, car loans, ect.

After 8 years, when my debt is paid off, I'll be putting that full $700 towards my investments.  I do also match my full 5% that my company currently offers in a 401K.  Does anybody have any advice or input on if this is a good plan or if I should make some changes to this?

So I've learned that gold value and dollar are inversely proportional. As a result, the gold mining company stocks sore in the mid-late 2012 as DXY kind of declined, and gold mining company stocks fell as DXY sore like crazy mid 2014ish. 
I got on the hype train on AUY hearing that FED will push dollar down but AUY is going down and i am getting nervous.
Is DXY not the right stock to look at to draw correlation?

Now the conference was a little short on details. All we know is that Lenovo is going to release a phone that is going to cost less than $500. The device is going to be released this Summer and the company doesn’t have a final design just yet. The picture you can see above is just one out of the five designs they are currently working on.

Also new today, Google announced an app incubator program to motivate developers. The best apps will be pre-loaded on Lenovo’s phone.

16-01-08,400p8r,Whats happening in China .................................................,"It's important to put the current situation in context. 

A 7% drop is a very serious drop because based on statistical inference if the total exchange is at -7% it means that many stocks have already reached their daily limit of -10%. This drop because it happened so early into the trading day is an historically large market crash, much steeper than 1929 or 1987. 

The market in China is made up mostly of inexperienced retail investors and traders so it runs on emotion and is probably the least reflective of actual underlying business and economic conditions of any stock market in the world. 

It is a cause for concern given the weakness in both their manufacturing and non manufacturing PMIs, both the official and the Caixin. It is the timing of the stock market rout and the PMIs that raises more concern with this selloff. 

The increasingly rapid drop in the Yuan is an extremely important tell that the economic managers over there are circling the wagons. 

The trade figures are due out in a few days. My guess is they would show even more deterioration than we have seen so far. 

Also that the government made an early move to block selling by major stockholders underscores the seriousness of the crash and connects it to the PMI data and the exchange rate. All this suggests the economic problems may be much deeper than it appears from any data. 

I have maintained for a while that we are in a hard landing. That has to be distinguished from both a soft landing and a crash landing or economic collapse. 

We had a hard landing in late 2008 and the economic numbers were a lot worse. We had real sequential loss for one quarter. That is a long way down from 7% growth estimates. 

The base case right now would be something akin to 2008, the equivalent of a moderate recession in the US. which is a big deal for a country which has not had one since its been industrialized. 

Now that we have gotten this far into the hard landing and are virtually certain their economic numbers lack a grounding in reality, the door must be opened for the first time to a crash landing. 

Right now the major probability is they will have a hard landing. However there is also maybe a 5% chance there will be a crash landing, that is something worse than we had in 2008. 

While this is terrible for commodities and materials stocks, it will have very little effect on the US. My best estimate would be it hurts the US GDP by a maximum of ~0.3%. It will also not have a major effect on US companies overseas profits. China accounts for only a small portion of those profits, less than 10%. There is very little US bank exposure over there to the best of my knowledge. 

Its possible European banks have a lot more exposure. The EU particularly Germany also has lot more exposure to foreign trade with China than we do. 

All this suggests to me buy US stocks on the downside move, whenever you think the time is right.

16-01-08,401lbt,The implications of the Chinese stock market tumble are exaggerated.,"I wrote most of this as a reply deep in a thread, but I'm interested in a discussion.

The fall in Chinese stock prices is being thought of as damaging to the Chinese economy, and taken as a sign of the economy's fundamental weakness in general. But the fall in prices is not nearly as damaging as a similar fall would be in the West, and its implications are being exaggerated. Firstly, stocks (only account for 15% of household financial assets in China)[http://uk.businessinsider.com/chinese-households-invest-little-in-stocks-2015-7?r=US&amp;IR=T], and have not decreased significantly over a year ago. Second, the Chinese economy is not as organized around finance as Western economies. I'll explain what I mean by that below. So whereas in the West, stock prices tend to measure people's general willingness to invest, Chinese stock prices measure no more than people's willingness to invest in stocks. People could be turned off of stocks in China, but investment would still continue, because of differences in the structure of the economy.

The total value of the Chinese stock market has not changed since a year ago. The Shanghai Composite Index is [down only 3% over 9 Jan 2015, despite a huge bubble in the middle](http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/.SSEC).

So, investment in stocks has been virtually zero-sum in China. Money has moved around, but there is not less than before.

An important thing to understand about China is that the Chinese economy is not as overwhelmingly financial as Western economies. That is, in the West, organization and innovation leading to growth occur when money can accumulate in public companies by investment, or in private hands by lending. This is dictated by stock investors' and banks' willingness to invest or lend, respectively, which is largely a function of financial mood, measured by stock prices and interest rates.

In China, contrarily, most organization and investment is either state-financed or privately-financed. That is, the willingness to invest is not dictated by people's expectation that stock prices will rise or banks' expected return. Rather, it is dictated mostly either by the extremely long-termist state economic planners, building infrastructure, etc., in order to produce a more organized and productive society/economy; or by the already rich elites, who invest in order to recover future profits. Their long-termism is evidenced by their preemptive construction of ""ghost cities"", much maligned in the West, which [Forbes predicts will eventually be ""filled"" as China's urban population grows as expected.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2015/07/20/what-will-become-of-chinas-ghost-cities/)",23

16-01-08,400xgz,ELI5 how I make money from a 3 fund lazy portfolio,"Alright so I had 10k sitting in an ally money market account earning .85%. I kept reading and reading how mutual funds would be a better place for that money.

So I followed the lazy portfolio guideline and put that 10k into a 3 fund portfolio. In August 2015 I put the money into VBMFX, VGTGX &amp; VTSMX. 

So in 5 months, my initial 10k investment is now worth $9270. I've lost $730. 

Perhaps I'm not understanding this correctly but I don't see the value of these funds per share price growing exponentially from where they are now any time soon. Their share prices will never be in the hundreds. But I'm using a stock market train of thought.

16-01-08,401n7l,Does this not worry anyone else?,"I posted this as a response in another topic but figured more people would see it this way.

There's a stone cold assumption that the stock market is fairly priced now but what data are you guys look at to support that?

The market expansion in recent years was due to the expansion of P/E ratios and not earnings. Now that free money(QE) has stopped these ratios will contract to more reasonable values.

Look at a company like PG as a perfect example because it's a stock that will generally be a steady eddy during downturns. In 2007 it sold at a P/E of 22.6, a bit high for a mature company. It fell down to 16.8 with the market crash in 2008 - a reasonable P/E for a mature company if a bit high. Then it rose and rose and it's now at a 26.5 as of 2015. How is that reasonable for a mature company that's growing their earnings in the single digits. Analysts expect a 6% earnings contraction in 2016 and then 5yr growth in the 7% range. That seems like a steep price to pay for that type of growth. 
This stock market has a ways to go before the fundamentals no longer support a big reduction.

People flocked to stocks because there's no alternative investments due to low interest rate and cheap debt. Companies leveraged up on cheap debt and will likely tank hard when and if the economy starts to contract. A 26 P/E for a company like PG(a great company no doubt) is freaking steep by any sort of historical measure. Sure you can say that historical measures no longer apply because of current economic conditions but I totally don't agree. ",7

We are talking about a company with such shitty financials that you can see their shrinking cash position in their SP on a weekly basis, twice as much debt as equity, and you gotta love a company whose last Q earnings per share quarter-over-quarter were -100%.  

Now having said all that, they are not unfairly priced, with P/B at 0.42 reflecting the debt situation correctly, and the P/S of 0.05 clearly taking into account that these guys don't fuck. Finally, market cap of ~$7m compared to sales of ~$150m (at a loss of $33m) doesn't leave much room for enterprise value, even calculating all the above. So basically, I don't see much room for SP to fall drastically further (no more than 15-20%) on a bad ER, whereas a good ER would deliver the same 15-20% boost in the positive, but may also draw a higher valuation multiple if they can point at something, anything positive in forward guidance for 2016.

I love it. But I wonder what [he thought in 2008?](http://www.thestreet.com/story/11417253/1/kass-the-wisdom-of-jeremy-siegel.html)

I believe that the stock market will do better in 2008 than it did in 2007, when it chalked up a 5.5% return, the fifth year in a row that the market went up. Year-ahead forecasts for the market are notoriously difficult, but I believe that a 10% to 12% gain is possible, on the heels of a recovering financial sector. Financial stocks plummeted about 20% last year, and this was the reason why the market had a mediocre year. Outside of financials, the S&amp;P 500 Index had double digit returns. A revival of financial stocks would spur good market gains this year.

Its by all measure foolish to double down on this hand because you will very likely lower the strength of your hand just to bet that dealer will bust and pay you double. Sure enough this morning the dealer didn't bust and showed a strong hand and opened almost 1% higher. With my profits now cut to $150 because my averaging up to double my exposure I was losing my gains twice as a fast and had to make a quick decision and either sell now or risk going negative. I decided to cut my gains and walked with $150 profit... an hour later the market stalled and came back down and would have made me whole again but because I didn't have the flexibility to hold and watch the move.

16-01-08,402ah2,Some DD: $BNHLF,"Trying this once more since mods like to fuck with me. 


Before I go into numbers, here is some info on the company:

**Company info:**

Telesta Therapeutics $BNHLF is a Canadian pharmaceutical company based in Montreal, Quebec. The lead product in their pipeline, Mycobacterium phlei Cell Wall-Nucleic Acid Complex (MCNA), stands as a possible therapeutic alternative to cystectomy in the event of failure of the current biologic standard of care for superficial bladder cancer, intravesical administration of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (bCG). 

**Drug background info:**

Superficial bladder cancer, also known as non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), accounts for roughly three quarters of all bladder cancer. The standard of care for the treatment of low grade NMIBC is surgery and a single dose of intravesical chemotherapy.
Intermediate and high grade NMIBC undergo transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), followed later by intravesical administration of bCG. bCG was first utilized in an anticancer capacity in the 1930s, but became more commonplace as such in the 1970s. The theory of this regimen is to debulk the tumor, destroy microscopic disease, and spare the patient from cystectomy. However, 40-50% of patients with NMIBC will fail bCG therapy, putting them at risk for recurrence and progression of disease, especially in the case of high risk tumors.

 bCG failure creates a major treatment dilemma: attempt additional bCG instillations and hope for success with the possibility of disease progression, or default to radical cystectomy - a major surgery with substantial quality of life considerations. 

This is where Telesta comes in. Unlike bCG, MCNA does not contain live organisms, but is rather a suspension of the constituents of the bacterium; however, their mechanisms of action are thought to overlap. When placed in the human body, the immune system will recognize these constituents as foreign, and initiate an innate immune response. Similar to bCG, the immunologic mechanism is very complex and not fully understood. Although the mechanisms of action of these two drugs are similar, MCNA was still able to illicit a beneficial therapeutic response in patients who failed bCG therapy as demonstrated in its [Phase 3 clinical trial.](http://www.jurology.com/article/S0022-5347%2814%2904590-X/abstract) 

**Phase 3 FDA Results:** 

Sounds great right? Well here is the catch. The FDA advisory committee's (ADCOM) reviewed the phase 3 clinical results and decided in a 18-6 vote that the risk-benefit profile of MCNA is not favorable. The ADCOM notes that the primary endpoint of at least 40% disease-free survival (DFS) was not reached. Instead, after accounting for some confounding factors, the FDA's analysis demonstrated a 20.9% DFS. Contrast this to Valrubicin, the only FDA-approved drug for patients with BCG-refractory carcinoma in situ, that demonstrates a 6-month remission of 18%, a two-year disease-free probability of 4%. Interestingly, the FDA was able to dig a valuable nugget out of the data, with caveats of course, indicating durable responses based on 6-month data in the carcinoma in situ (CIS) groups.

**Bottom Line:** 

Despite the setback of the ADCOM's 18-6 ""no"" vote on the question of MCNA's benefit-risk profile, I am of the opinion that the drug still has good potential and significant value. I believe this drug can win FDA approval. I base this belief on the fact that [most urologists on the board favored approval](http://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/telesta-therapeutics-announces-results-of-the-fda-advisory-committee-vote-551714381.html), while some board members stated they would opt for approval if the indication were narrowed to patients who could not/would not undergo cystectomy. In my opinion, the benefit outweighs the risk, given the niche market and the [seemingly enthusiastic guidance from the FDA on page 45 regarding utilization of this drug in a certain patient subpopulation.](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/BloodVaccinesandOtherBiologics/CellularTissueandGeneTherapiesAdvisoryCommittee/UCM472799.pdf)



**MONEY, NUMBERS, AND SHIT:**

As of the last financial statement Telesta has [$40 million in cash and liquid securities, and a burn rate of $1.3 million per month.](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/telesta-therapeutics-publishes-its-q1-2016-financial-statements-and-provides-corporate-updates-546613922.html) This gives them plenty of time and money to work their way into the market. The share price has increased 74% since I purchased them in late December, currently trading at $0.32 per share. The final YES or NO from the FDA will come in February. 




**TL;DR:** Buy this fucking stock, validate me, make money. YOLO",6
16-01-08,402akk,GPRO may be a good buy going into earnings,"I think earnings is going to be first week of february some time.

They don't pay a dividend so I suggest you don't allocate more than 1-2% of your portfolio to this trade.  

So, if you have $500 -$600 committed to this trade. Your entry points should be the following:

- 16.75 = 5 shares
- 14.75 = 6 shares
- 12.75 = 7 shares
- 10.50 = 8
- 7.75 =  10 shares
- 5.00ish = 16 shares

=52 shares, average price $9-11$ per share. 

Fundamentals - Company looks pretty healthy on the balance sheet. Seems like earnings is growing. At the prices sub -10 it will be a good candidate for a buy out IMO. 

Technicals 

- I think a solid rebound point would be 14-15 area , where it would rally to 17-18 before earnings if no good news comes out.
- After that rally, I think it will drop back down to lower levels before earnings. $12-14
- if earnings is positive and received positively by the market then it will continue to around 20  to 25.
- if earnings is negative then it will continue  downward, which is where you continue to average down to the 5.00 area or reassess at this point and see if you want to commit the remaining $250.

16-01-09,404k4y,Explanation of fund distribution,"I'm looking at a fund of fund and the sub doc section regarding distributions is a little confusing. The first two sections are ""Cash Distributions during Operations"" and last section is ""Cash Distributions from Capital Transactions"".

""Class B Members will receive all distributable cash until they have received 10% cumulative, preferred annualized return on their investment calculated against their Unreturned Capital Contributions"" - this means 10% annual return with the amount decreasing each quarter due to decline of unreturned capital contribution?

""Any remaining distributable cash will be split XX/XX between Class A and Class B until Class B members have received 20% target IRR plus 2x equity multiple"" - confused on return from this? Obviously depends on how much remaining cash is left after initial 10% cumulative distribution.

""...Class B members will receive all distribution cash until they have received a return of 100% of their initial capital contribution"" - what happens once the initial contribution amount is returned? Does the fund stop paying? I'm assuming not but confused on how returns are calculated. ",4

It went down from there, and i decided to sell it.
At around 1 it was pretty low, so i bought it again because i thought it had the rest of the day to rise, but right when i bought it it fell.
Now im really done because now i have $180, and i have school on monday, so i cant trade then.

16-01-09,406vx1,"Health and Biotech funds' performance in 2015/16","Hey guys. So I have a bit invested in two funds:
AXA Framlington Biotech (around $6000)
Pictet-Health (around $5000)

Both had very decent results pre-2016. But 2015 was a bummer (it was obviously a bummer for the equities overall, but I expected a bit better from the funds). Both funds have around -6% since I bought them (around Feb 2015).
AXA Framlington Biotech had +65.24 in 2013, +46.68 in 2014 and +12.29 in 2015.
Pictet-Health: +24.37	in 13, +40.24 in 14, +6.20 in 15.

My question is - was I just unlucky with timing the purchase, and there's a good chance health/biotech will do well this year. Or should I sell one of these and move it to tech - I was thinking of doing that, but don't have extra cash, so has to be one of these funds. I feel like holding both in the health sector is just too risky. My other holding include iShares MSCI World UCITS and Vanguard US Opportunities.
My main concern is that my portfolio will still be very US-centered. But I feel investing in the main tech giants Google/Alphabet, Apple etc. is more stable than health at the moment.

16-01-09,404xux,My next bet... shorting Las Vegas.,"I am from Las Vegas and was previously a Sen. Financial Analyst at one of the major casino groups. Macau has been hit tremendously in the past year due to stricter VIP money restrictions and poor junket performance. Basically - the wealthy aren't gambling anymore.

Add on the potential economic crash in Chinese markets, currency devaluation, and potential housing market crash and it would spell more disaster for Macau. WYNN, LVS (Venetian), and MGM all have substantial exposure to China. Not only that, but two of them are opening new mega-casinos in the near future costing in excess of $4bn *each*.

City Center for MGM is the last time a casino cost that much and it was at the peak of the financial boom in the 2000s. The debt on their sheets was catastrophic and still exists there today. These casino groups about to open new resorts will suffer catastrophic losses in value if the Chinese housing market busts or stocks crash.

So, the logical move (to me) is shorting the casinos most likely to take a hit. WYNN has the highest revenue exposure and is opening one of the mega-casinos. They are on top of my list. 

Next would be MGM, who has the lowest exposure to China, but in habit of making the same mistakes their wise executives are about to open a megacasino there too late again. How much debt can the company incur before imploding? *If* China's markets crash, MGM will have debt on their balance sheets that total two full years of Las Vegas's entire gaming revenue. Not their own, not income.... total revenue. They aren't *that* profitable, especially if Asian high rollers continue to stay home.

Venetian is also widely exposed to Macau's health. It's a worthy short as well. Venetian and Wynn aren't as diversified as MGM either, so trouble in China will be a bigger issue.

Thoughts? My biggest issue is that I'm a complete novice with shorting a stock. I understand the concept but have never performed one. My Ameritrade account seems limited in shorting features as well.

EDIT: Thanks for the input all. I will look over other options that are less risky than an outright short.",121

16-01-08,403pqt,AAPL analysts - getting it wrong and still getting paid for it,"This, again, is what I love about Wall-Street Stock analysts.  They are so often more wrong than right that one wonders why they are getting paid anything to do what they do.

Take Apple Computer (AAPL) as the latest example.  Note **[this chart from Finviz captured here](https://thegodoftrading.wordpress.com/2016/01/08/aapl-analysts-the-wrong-advice-and-still-getting-paid-for-it/)** documenting analysts' recommendations for the last quarter – all except one being on the buy side with price targets ranging from a new high ground around 130 to as high as 179.  And only one downgrade in the bunch.  One.

AAPL closed today at 97.  All these analysts’ “Buys”, “Overweights” and “Reiterateds” came before now, higher up.

I suppose these guys have all sorts of fundamental reasons why AAPL should go up.  The company has tons of cash, many fine products, avoids  a lot of taxes, had a reputation for industry-disruptive innovations.

But the thing about fundamentals is, in the end, none of them matter if the price of the stock no longer agrees with them.

When everyone who loves AAPL, and buys its story, already owns it, one wonders if the analysts ever wonder who are they going to be able to sell it to;  when a company achieves a market cap north of $500 billion (let alone the $700 billion Apple bought for itself), one wonders if any of these analysts might wonder if history repeats – with the exception of Exxon-Mobil – every company reaching that lofty number has eventually had its stock cut in half.

A lot of these mistakes could be cured, or at least alleviated, by adding market timing to their analysis but I’d bet they would join the rest of the Wall-Street chorus harping that no one can time the market. No one. Fact is, it is they who can’t time the market.  One glance at a stock chart would not have hinted the stock was going down, it would have flat out said it was going down.

But since they keep getting paid despite being consistently wrong for whatever reasons, why should it matter to them?

Well…hard to believe, but maybe one day these guys’ clients might take note.

By the way none of this should be construed as investment advice.  As a solitary trader when I’m right only the market pays me, and when I’m wrong it takes it back.

P.S. AAPL *is* going to be a buy soon…for a bounce to $106 or so, maybe $111, but longer-term…mentioned above something about being cut in half so enough said.

Their PE is 8.43 and their EPS is 114USD. I looked at their financial statement as of 2014 and it looks healthy (to me. I'm new so I know I am probably misinterpreting or looking at the wrong things)

Is the issue due to Samsung's falling market share/dominance in the smartphone industry? Also, if anyone can point out my mistakes, thanks a lot! I'm not sure what to look at in the balance sheet.",32

16-01-09,4086d7,"Is Gasoline RBOB the measure of gasoline prices? Why did it go up significantly in 2011? If oil drops to $20, will we see the SAME gas price as we did in 1996?","Here is the chart - http://finviz.com/futures_charts.ashx?t=RB&amp;p=m1

My most basic question is - what IS gasoline RBOB? ELI5.

Obviously Crude Oil impacts Gasoline prices. 
There is also factors to take into account such as storage, gasoline refining, etc.

What I don't exactly understand is - why in 2011 did it increase significantly?

In 1996 Oil was $20 (not adjusted for inflation). Gasoline was an average of $1.36/gallon. Given Gasoline RBOB's ""meteoric"" rise in recent years, if Oil were to hit $20 - what could we realisitically see gasoline prices equate to?

How do you find out what future gas prices may be if Crude drops to X?

16-01-09,408b4p,"How are ETF shares ""deleted"" or ""destroyed""?","Let's say a that in a given day, 0.5% of all outstanding mutual fund shares are redeemed. The mutual fund company can sell 0.5% of its holdings to fulfill the redemptions, and there will be 0.5% fewer shares of that mutual fund in existence. I'm simplifying a bit since redemptions can be paid via inflows or the fund's cash on hand, but you get the picture. 

How does this work with ETFs? Once a share is created, can it ever cease to exist since it has to be exchanged between a private buyer and seller instead of a ""middleman"" like in a mutual fund company? Couldn't this potentially cause liquidity issues if the components of an ETF are liquid, but the ETF isn't? 

Am I missing something completely obvious? ",3

And it's just made a big purchase of APPIA which is why it's    pretty bad in the balance sheets. It's net income has always been bad but it's gonna a little bit worst recently . But who cares in this trade  we ain't gonna be holding for long. (Max 1-4 days)

Okay pals this stock has been being thrown around by the bears recently , Like a lot of stocks in this tulip-esque year. So here is where the rubber meets the road, This stock has been up and down  for a long time and has a history of overreacting on patterns. It just happens right now a Doji has occured after a downstreak. This is a  classic reversal signal and  is a sign that traders are questioning the trend. Basically they aren't smart. This is a very safe trade as it has some solid support only a few cents below and solid resistance isn't until 1.44-1.46.

Now since risk is so low we can afford to raise the stakes a little bit and bet that it will pass  the resistance. And when it passes here this is when the buzzards swarm the meat. Position traders will all jump on top of this and drive up the prices.  

I am completely confident that this will reach 1.60 . Easy  %15
+ profit . The reason I am so confdent for this 15% is because these things have played out over and over and over again.
They rarely have differing results. And this one especially is like a text book cut out.

1) Is Optionshouse good for day trading? As in how long does it take for each buy/sell order to go through usually? I know its based off what prices you pick and the trading volume but is it usually immediate as in no delay? Because a friend of mine who uses a different discount broker online told me sometimes for him it reflects on his account a few hours later even if it gets sold earlier or something like that I don't quite remember. 

2) Also I know they have a chart but is it a ""live time"" chart during regular trading hours? And do they have ""live time"" info about how much people are buying for and selling for a certain stock like each second in the stock market? 

3) My last question is a general question about selling and buying stocks. So for example lets say i want to purchase 4543 stocks of a certain stock. In order to buy 4543 stocks of that specific stock, does a person out there have to be selling exactly 4543 stocks of that certain stock? Or does the 4543 stocks come from a total of other people who sell lets say for example, 200, 543, 1800, 1000, 1000 and so they charge $4.95 per each person that consists of the 4543 stocks? or is it just 4.95 per the completion of the order of 4543 stocks?

* Assuming the prize on Wednesday is 1.3 billion

* Opting for the 29 year annuity option

* Assuming 40% tax on yearly payout

* Assuming only **one** winner

That means 1 300 000 000 * 0.6 (after tax) * 1/292 201 338 = 2.67$ is the amount you should pay for those kinds of odds (sort of like the breakeven point).

From my research, the price of a ticket is only 2$!

Or more to the point:

* 1) Buy all combinations =&gt; 292 mil * 2$ a ticket = 584 mil cost.

* 2) Wait until Wednesday

* 3) Prize would be a total annuity summing to 780 mil after tax

* 4) Your total return would be 196 million, or ~33% return on investment ----&gt; Profit!

Also, bonus, this doesn't take into account the amount of money that you'll get back from what you invested (i.e. part of the 584 mil should go into the pot that you then win back - I don't know for sure what proportion though, so I ignored it)

&gt; **TL;DR** Someone who buys out all the possible lottery combinations will still make a return on his investment at its current payout/cost to enter.

What I would desire... the ability to immediately invest this cash in a fund or funds as soon as it hits the account without having to log in and make a new trade regardless of the amount of the contribution.

All the buzz words are words that worry me, so after much asking, I finally took a look at the brochures the company puts out.

I have tried to explain to him that martingales work up until you're bankrupt, then you're lost with everything. His response (And those of all the family members he has), has been that it's impossible for any strategy to fail in this setup simply because gold and forex has value and isn't simple gambling. My response to them has been that since they're using margins, they more-or-less are trading in assets that can have $0, or even negative value should the market move very rapidly in one direction and wipe out the margin reserve.
  
I told him that I would ask a group of people that know more than I do, so here I am. I do not actively trade stocks (Only long term buy &amp; hold), so this is all something I can't claim much knowledge on, but feel my thoughts are correct about this 'system'. ",123

I used to be really into it before the crash, but I've been away for a while. I'm just now getting back into it by analyzing the numbers of a bunch of companies for practice.

One of them really seems to not make sense to me, though. Charter Communications (CHTR). Here's the Yahoo Finance Link: http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=CHTR

They're losing money, have little cash on hand, huge long term debt, and they're in the process of buying Time Warner. Time Warner has little cash and even more debt. 

Any other company that has such a huge amount of debt, comparatively little cash, and is losing money would be punished by the market. Furthermore, cable is in somewhat of a precarious position. Regulators are starting to look at regulations (net neutrality, etc) and fewer people have cable TV. Yet, the analysts and everybody else seem to be bullish on the stock.

Since these guys do this for a living and I'm a novice, I know that I'm the one that must be wrong about this, but I just don't see why. I was hoping you guys could explain to me how CHTR is financially secure enough to be in a position to stay alive, let alone be in a position to pay tens of billions for Time Warner. ",2

16-01-10,40dhzo,Comparing Lump Sum vs. Dollar Cost Averaging with IPython on the $SPY from 2000-2016,"Hi guys, in an [earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3z24ov/does_consistently_investing_your_annual_bonus_in/) I'd been wondering about potential seasonal risk when investing a lump sum every January (prognosis: probably not).

That got me to thinking about a claim I've heard running around in places like bogleheads or [investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/07/dca-fight.asp#axzz1UGjyAHAt) that lump sum is statistically better than dollar cost averaging (DCA) ~66% of the time. Online it seems to be settled, but the topic has come up in person a few times, so the claim needs to be tested.

I decided to run the numbers via a little experiment. **Here's the nicer formatted [IPython Notebook link](http://elucidation.github.io/lumpsum_vs_dca/)**, but I put a TL;DR below also.

---

**TL;DR** : 

Experiment is comparing lump sum investing of $10k vs. spreading $10k investment out over 12 months on the SPY from Feb 2000 - Jan 2016.

Here's three charts, the top shows SPY.

[Comparison chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Elucidation/lumpsum_vs_dca/master/output_20_0.png)

The middle chart shows the X axis as the date we started our investment (lump is all $10k at that point, DCA is first month then, then every 30 days for 12 buys total), the Y axis is the final investment return of that $10k today. 
The bottom chart shows the difference between the two, positive is when lump sum returns more. 

Summary:

* Lump sum did return more ~~63%~~ 66.3% of the time, statistically on average ~~0.9%~~ 2.24% more (only specific to this data, not generalizable)
* Dollar Cost Averaging is a form of smoothing that reduces the 'volatility' associated with investing date.
* Claim of lump sum being a better choice ~66% of the time validated
* Either method would have brought great returns the earlier you start, even at the worst possible times such as bubble of 2007.
* [List of assumptions](http://elucidation.github.io/lumpsum_vs_dca/#Assumptions) (no dividend yield, no cash interest, etc. etc. etc., this is a very simplistic analysis)

---
I used IPython Notebook, Pandas and Matplotlib to collect/analyze/plot the data. It was a surprisingly smooth experience, pandas provides a lot of clean methods to get and analyze the data. Feel free to bootstrap off of the code to run your own experiments/toy quant models, I'm looking forward to revisiting this in the future

This all started because I'd been discussing lump sum &amp; DCA with a friend and wanted to have a better intuitive grasp of the two. Even though this is super basic, I hope this will be useful to some of you.

* ~~1/11/2016 - edit: At the suggestion of /u/Mister_Dilkington I used VFIAX (similar to S&amp;P total return) to do a [comparison taking dividend yield into account](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/40dhzo/comparing_lump_sum_vs_dollar_cost_averaging_with/cytu0ta ), lump sum wins 66.3% of the time there~~

16-01-11,40gna9,FCPT,"FCPT (the REIT spinoff from DRI) announced a big one-time, mostly stock taxable dividend.  
  
1) I think whatever stock reporting service my broker (Merrill Edge) uses, ought to do a better job of reporting one-time dividends.  They added the regular quarterly dividend to the special dividend, multiplied by four and report that as an annual dividend rate (which is over 100% of the stock price).  Do other online sources misreport FCPT that badly?  
  
2) A big, taxable, stock dividend is a major annoyance in a taxable account.  So I sold all the FCPT I had in a taxable account.  The gain I realized on that sale is even more income than the giant dividend would be.  But I can balance that gain by selling some unrealized losses.  Since I will have over $3K of other dividends, I couldn't balance this extra dividend by taking net capital loss.  
  
3) I hate deals like this, where you need to make a selection to influence the mix of cash vs. stock you get.  Merrill Edge charges $30 per account to forward such a selection to the transfer agent (and you can't do so any other way) even in a account that otherwise has almost zero fees.  It takes a lot of research to even make a good guess which choice might be better than the default, then your choice is pro-rated so you can't predict whether you get enough of it to be even worth the $30 fee per account vs. just letting the default happen.  I had FCPT in my IRA and one of my wife's IRAs and I didn't sell those and will probably just let the default cash/stock mix occur, rather than research and pay $30 per account.  
  
4) Despite all those negatives, I think FCPT is a good investment.  So I bought back in another of my wife's IRAs a few shares more than I sold in my taxable account.  
  
Anyone else here invested in FCPT?  Do you have any insight or opinions on the above?

The bond issue earned Bowie $55 million, which he reportedly used to buy back songs from his catalog owned by his former manager.


It may have sounded like a good idea on paper, but in March 2004, Moody’s Investors Service cut the Bowie Bonds to just one notch above junk. A spokesperson from the ratings agency said the downgrade “was prompted by lower than expected revenues generated by the assets due to weakness in sales for recorded music,” according to The Telegraph.

Having this empirical data in my mind, I'd like to double-check my stock selections to pinpoint where I stand. On top of that, I would like to ask you what strategy can be recommended to me to choose stocks for investment; once you made a decision, where would you begin with and what do you do beforehand to make your choice?

16-01-11,40et90,Stock market poised for big Monday action!,"On Friday the VIX (volatility index) reached its highest point since September 2015. It was 27 on Friday. However it reached as high as 40.74 back in August of 2015. 

Worries about the Chinese stock market, Apples iPad sales decline, weather and lower gas prices propelled this 7 3/4% decline. Seems like an over reaction. China has a small impact on the US. IPad sales? No biggie. Lower gas prices are bad for oil companies but good for others. Obviously it puts more money into the pockets of consumers. Other companies in the S&amp;P will obviously benefit. 

The S&amp;P still has to close down more than 2% to drop below the Sept 28 low. For now this 2016 drop is still within a safe technical range. If the S&amp;P doesn't breach the $1881.77 mark then a nice bounce upward seems due. The Friday close may have been your best entry point. Otherwise Monday just might be a great entry point if you're a market timer looking for a quick 5% gain. ",7

16-01-11,40gu4e,Take out a HELOC to buy home next door as rental property?,"I live in a relatively exclusive area of Southwest Florida.  My home is paid for and is on 1.5 acres.  The home next door has come up on the market and is on 2.7 acres.  I have enough money in the bank where if I also took out a 75% HELOC, I could buy the place next door outright and rent it out.  Rental prices are such in this area that I should earn about 10% per month after all expenses.

I wouldn't qualify for a regular mortgage.

Homes in this area are starting to be purchased to be knocked down so mansions can be built.  If I one day decide to sell both properties, having 4 acres instead of 1.5 would be extremely attractive to potential buyers.

Biggest risks I see are hurricanes (I'd of course have insurance) and sea level rise (I'm at 6 feet elevation) as both my properties would be within 200 feet of each other.

Feel free to bash or w.e because you can go fuck yourself. 

AAPL
- https://www.tradingview.com/x/FtfCO0KQ/
- first position is 96. but I think a better entry if it goes to it is 92, 87. Prepared to buy all the way to 18. First 50% of my max risk for this trade will give an average price of about $75 minus dividends received. If it continues lower, I'll have to reassess whether to use the other 50% allotted for this trade. 

TD
- https://www.tradingview.com/x/wpIAAwrl/

was in at 51. got out at 55 on the TSX. Waiting to get back in 49/50ish prepared to buy all the way to $15. Due to this being a staple, for canada anyway, the max I'm willing to risk is 10% of my account.

SPY
- https://www.tradingview.com/x/sBWooI8L/

RDS.A
- https://www.tradingview.com/x/JxCDuRj5/
- currently in this trade at $47.75. each marked line will be where I buy more shares to average down, until I'm capped out in my max risk for this equity. Pays a solid dividend which reduces the loss.
WMT
-  https://www.tradingview.com/x/Qr47bvmO/
walmart was a successful trade. IN at 61.75 out at 64.50

USO
- https://www.tradingview.com/x/W4nXjxWv/
-  thinking of waiting until friday for expiration. If it is near my marked lines, I will sell a ITM put nearest the underlying, expecting to be put shares and sell a february ATM call. Will ladder the trade for march if uso approaches my break even price. 

cl1!
- https://www.tradingview.com/x/IpeEIHOa/

All lines are approx determined by Historical Vol. They are what I believe to be potential pivot points. I have no idea how to predict which one, if I did I'd be rich. So my strategy for the popular ones with dividends is to just average down with incremental purchases.

http://seekingalpha.com/article/3802596-nobilis-a-speculative-buy-before-restatement-details-announced-in-days-ahead

Nobilis Health Corp. has been surrounded by uncertainty for months, with its stock down 75% from its 2015 high.

The uncertainty will likely clear up after a restatement of previous financials is released in the coming days and management updates guidance.

Given that its 2015 EV/EBITDA ratio is now at less than half the industry average, the stock has lots of upside if the company's preview on the restatement is confirmed.

16-01-12,40js5r,"First DD, looking for a $HIL bounce.","First off, hi and hello everyone, let me try to make a case for my first DD. $HIL is a stock that I've owned off and on for several years and so I tend to keep an eye on it and now it is sparking my interest.

Fundamentally (sorta): Early last year they had a buyout offer from DC Capital at $5.50 a share, but management refused the sale claiming that they intended to create more shareholder value. Bulldog investors (5% holders) forced a proxy vote that was still denied. [SA article about it](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3243346-hill-international-bulldog-investors-uphill-battle). DC Capital reiterated their buyout offer at $4.75 a share ([letter](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3762776-dc-capital-letter-to-hill-international)) this past December. Fundamentally, HIL has failed to meet their own goals (very typical of the company), but isn't in a different ballpark either.

Technically: HIL is a low volume stock that has a history of a quickly moving price. Recently there was a spike in price due to the reiteration of a buyout, but almost all gains were given back over the last week or so. I believe HIL to be at a support line and due for an upwards bounce. [Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/HIL/kmGXgMRY-HIL-Bounce/). I think that there could be a $0.20 to $0.30 (5-9%) rise in price over the course of this coming week. I believe the steady and somewhat positive price action today and yesterday amidst a volatile market are positive signs for a local bottom to have been reached.

Disclaimer, I do not own any stock as of now, but may be purchasing some tomorrow morning. Also, note that I am, like a true WSB'er, always wrong about my predictions so you may want to ignore this. And on the bright side, if caught bag holding, DC Capital seems pretty insistent on buying the company out and I wouldn't be surprised if we heard more about that in March. GL and HF",8

I am looking to make a sizable investment to diversify my portfolio. In addition to the stocks I currently own (which I like to manage and make some riskier bets), I would like to buy some ETFs to round things out a bit. As I understand it, Vanguard ETFs seem to be the safest bet recommended here, though The Street always has their picks. What should I know about ETFs? Should I pick a few Vanguard ETFs? Is there a standard for diversification?

16-01-11,40hq1x,My DCA strategy for investing in oil and emerging markets,"I'm aware that a few of the more prominent voices in this subreddit enjoy scoffing at those attempting to catch falling knives, but give me the benefit of the doubt and allow me to present my strategy. Also, I suspect you old goats are making oil plays yourselves ;).

I'm particularly interested in oil and emerging markets for the upside potential they possess, considering both have hit historical lows and are still dropping. Emerging markets are currently falling at a [10-year low](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=VWO+Interactive), hitting prices first crossed in late Nov 2005. Similarly we have oil stocks, like those held in Vanguard's Energy ETF *also* at a [10-year low](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=VDE+Interactive), first breaching this price in August of 2005.

Huge opportunity? I think so. My belief is that both sectors will recover their losses, and possibly cross into new record highs within the coming decade. I suppose its possible that emerging markets are in a Nikkei-esque bubble and could stay down for 20+ years, but I doubt it. In the past 26 years the volatile MSCI emerging market index has a CAGR of 10.73%, so basically I'm betting on mean reversion for the sector. As for oil, the limited non-renewable resource that makes everything from gas to plastic hip replacements, companies simply are not profitable at these levels, so the price seems like it will go up eventually. But with both, the process may simply take a lot of time. The key investor value here is *patience*, but I have that in spades.

In summary, I believe patient long-term investors have a once per decade opportunity in picking up oil and emerging stocks at incredible bargain-bin prices.

DCAing into oil and emerging markets: As written up in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/40dhzo/comparing_lump_sum_vs_dollar_cost_averaging_with/) recent post, lump sum investing is much better on average, *but* not when stocks are falling. So I've started taking up positions in oil and emerging markets throughout the year, starting in the fall of 2015. Here's my process:

* Invest $X into a diversified basket of oil and emerging market ETFs ([VDE](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=vde), [XOP](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=xop), [XLE](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=xle) for oil; [EEM](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=eem), [EEMS](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=eems), [FRN](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=frn) for emerging markets).
* Set an alert at Fidelity to send me a text message if any ETF price drops 15%.
* Ignore financial media. Spend time with family and friends. Enjoy my life.
* If my phone buzzes with a notification from Fidelity, I pick up another position in that ETF.
* [Fast forward 3-5 years] Profit.

I like how I'm not really trying to time the market with this strategy, just lowering my cost basis as the stock drops. I don't even need to watch market trends or the strength of the dollar, etc. I do suspect that they are tied together to some degree, so a rise in one may coincide with a rise in the other.

I should mention that just a small portion of my overall portfolio is in this play, with the rest of my funds allocated to low cost index funds, so this is really just a version of /r/WallStreetBets/ play money. That said, my positions are quite sizeable, so I do want to be smart about this.

Thoughts? Is 15% a decent threshold to pick up more stock, or do you suggest a better one? Thanks in advance.",2

I'd guess the majority fall under category (b) and are suffering from a very strong case of get-evenitis (i.e. the reluctance to sell now and take a sure loss versus staying in the market and gambling further in hopes of getting back to even).

How are people rationalizing their investment decisions currently?

(1) Inertia. Don't really think about the market.

(2) Don't believe that you can predict the market so don't try.

(3) Consider yourself a long-term buy-and-hold investor and believe in eventual mean reversion. (If so what would make you sell?)

(4) Have pre-defined sell levels and would cut allocations to stocks if those are hit.

(5) Kept some of your powder dry and have defined levels at which you would buy and increase allocations to stocks.

(6) Dazed and confused with no clue.

(7) Other (please describe)

Finally, if any of you are financial advisors, what are you telling clients? At what point would you abandon the ""standard"" advice of don't panic and ride it out? Did you modify your thinking after the experience of 2008-2009? (E.g. you now would recommend some type of stop loss.)

let's say i invest $10,000 into a stock or fund priced at $25.  I receive 400 shares.  At the end of the first year, I receive a dividend of $1 per share, or $400.  I reinvest it into the stock, which is priced at say $20 at that time, so I get another 20 shares and have 420 shares total.

And the end of the second year, I receive a dividend of $10 per share or $4200.  I reinvest it into the stock, which is priced at say $7 at that time, so I get another 600 shares.  

I now have 1020 total shares.  The value of the shares at the $7pps is $7,140.  I'm not doing well.  Based on my original investment of $10,000, I am down $ 2,860 or 28.6%.  And based on receiving 1020 shares on my original $10,000 investment, my cost basis per share is $9.80.  Let's call this option 1.

Or am I doing even worse than that?  Am I supposed to include the $400 and $4200 I rolled back into the stock as part of my cost basis?  Is my cost basis actually $14,600 -- which means that at a present value of $7,140 I am actually down over 50%?  And is my cost basis per share actually $14.31 ($14,600 divided by 1020 shares)?  Let's call this option 2.

My broker is telling me option 2 is the way the world works but I can't wrap my head around this.  Not only because it seems I'm that much dumber than I originally thought, but it just doesn't seem to make sense.  For example, let's say I hold the stock another year or more -- during which time there's no more dividends -- and the price creeps back up to $14.31.  Based on a $14,600 cost basis, I'm finally back to ""even"" and can sell for $0 gain or loss.  But that doesn't seem right -- I invest $10,000 at the start and a few years later I pull out $14,600, but I have $0 gain or loss?  Nothing to report or claim on taxes?  How can that be?",14

""Long time listener, first time caller. You guys are awful...
So I was sitting long on some stocks that weren't doing anything and I decided to change it up. I am shit at options trading but find it fun so I went straight to the earnings call calendar to find someone reporting soon to throw my money away on options and found PTSC.
They are reporting tomorrow and are a sub penny stock. Apparently they own a bunch of microprocessor patents.
I saw that I should read the sidebar for posting and I glanced at it so if this post gets removed or gets me banned, YOLO.
Anyhow, a couple of questions.
As a subpenny stock, what type of shit would they have to show during the call to get some good movement, what should I be looking for in their financials?
Are the pinks just bullshit in general?
I bought 30,000 shares for the hell of it and figured I would pop my YOLO cherry and post it here.""

Got into an argument with a mod because he said PTSC doesn't sell options, which it doesn't but I bought it and not options which I thought I made clear in my post.

&gt;What started as “peer to peer” lending has become deeply immeshed in the machinery of Wall Street. But in becoming entwined with old finance, many of the purported benefits of online lending have quickly disappeared. So despite the talk of “transparency”, the sort of granular loan level data available through a marketplace lender’s website or API disappears in a securitisation, where you just have another pool of loans with all the typical risks around borrower data and the incentives for a lender that makes most of its money from churning out new loans to loosen its underwriting standards. So as marketplace lending interacts with old finance, its deficiencies are exposed and investors ask for protection.

&gt;In other words, a good way of getting perspective on fintech is to see what happens when the capital markets are asked to buy the hype.",19

XOM - Exxon Mobil - Sounds like this is one of the ""safer"" ones out there as far as oil goes. The dividend on this is less than that of the other 2 at 4%

CVX - Chevron - Similar to XOM, but the dividend is 5.3% at current prices. 

RDS.A - Shell - 9.3% Dividend! The chart looks worse than the other 2 though as it's trending down pretty hard. Seems riskier. Just this week Shell dropped from 45/share to 40. More than a 10% drop in 1 week.

http://www.thestreet.com/story/13416506/1/here-s-why-it-s-time-to-invest-in-bitcoin-in-this-crazy-market.html  
  
Yes, Chinese and others looking for hard assets will find a safe refuge in Bitcoin that will only propel it's price higher as more people look to acquire it.  This is the Speculative stage of money, and Bitcoin would be no better than a common stock or gold if this were true.  
  
But they are ignoring key components of cryptocurrency: the ability to transcend its role as a speculative vehicle and create an actual transactional economy.  Some may argue that not much of a transactional economy can emerge with Bitcoin's current blocksize limitations, but there are many advanced protocols and proposals to fix that in the works.  As well there are many other amazing features, such as the ability to write data securely in a way that it can never be altered (still every computer around the world running Bitcoin has a copy of my poem I wrote last year, and they will forever as long as Bitcoin has value).  
  
Anyway, Bitcoin has essentially doubled its price in the past three months and I don't care how you want to spin it: that chart looks healthy - http://i.imgur.com/M8lXVZc.jpg  
  
2016 may be the year of the next big Bitcoin run... Remember, to create a decentralized and global financial network from nothing it **must** slowly rise from nothingness and undergo several dramatic expansion cycles (by price).  There is no other way to realistically do it.  
  
In other words, you cannot create a secure, global, and decentralized financial network without accidentally making a few people very wealthy - that is why Bitcoin makes such an attractive investment.  ",0

In early trade on Tuesday morning, West Texas Intermediate crude oil dropped 2.4% continuing a slide that on Monday saw the American benchmark fall below $31 per barrel for the first time since at least December 2003, more than 13 years ago.
As of 7:20 a.m. GMT (2:20 a.m. ET) it is trading at $30.65, and could crash through the $30 mark on Tuesday.

In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Hamm said the Saudis have created a “predatory” pricing environment.
“The Saudis turned 1.8 million barrels on, and basically their intent was to drown us. But they’ve not got that done. It’s been a monumental mistake for them, I might add, a trillion-dollar mistake,” said Hamm, the founder and chief executive of Oklahoma-based Continental Resources Inc. CLR, -3.97%  , a firm that helped pioneer oil production in the Bakken shale region and a key player in the so-called shale revolution.
Analysts, however, have forecast increasing pain for the U.S. oil industry. As many as a third of American oil-and-gas producers could tip toward bankruptcy and restructuring by mid-2017, according to Wolfe Research, though some may be able to survive if oil rebounds to at least $50 a barrel.

Hamm told CNBC that the bankruptcy threat has been exaggerated.

16-01-12,40nk86,[DWTI] I do believe this is the biggest YOLO that has ever been done on this subreddit. Full reasoning inside,"Hello to you all,

Let me introduce my most recent play:

[http://imgur.com/wDAe692](http://imgur.com/wDAe692)

First of all I was completely wrong and never anticipated such a drop. I never saw oil hitting the $30 mark. When the average production cost of a barrel worldwide is somewhere around the $33-39 mark, you of course never expect the product to go below the upper bound of the interval.

With that in mind, I am not specifically bullish on oil, but I am not specifically bearish neither. **The only reason I am doing this trade is that if oil kicks up by ANYTHING, DWTI will be wiped OUT! Say for instance oil kicks to $34 tomorrow for absolutely no reason; DWTI WOULD GO DOWN 40%!**

I am hoping to cover this position with DWTI under $100. With any luck, I will stand to make $100k-200k on that trade. **I know for a fact oil will go back up - eventually. I am prepared to ride a drop to $20 per barrel, but really nothing more. I sold all my other positions to go 100% on that trade. THIS TRADE REPRESENTS 100% OF MY PORTFOLIO RIGHT NOW.**

Now, why do I believe oil will go back up? Simply because the current price is the result of utter panic. People are flipping out and oil at $30 is of course not sustainable over the long term. Even at $60, oil is not sustainable. Eventually, one day, it will start rising again. Again, I do not need a rise to $60 to make money; **a rise to $40 would nearly wipe DWTI out.**

Of course, there are more reasons I'm doing this, more reasons being that the borrowing rate is low, DWTI is overbought, oil seems to be finally bottoming (perhaps $28-29 until mass bankruptcies hit?) and I am prepared to hold this for a very long time.

GLTA this is the trade of my life.",81

Read the entire page it's fucking hilarious. 

""At the end of the American Revolutionary War he bought large amounts of depreciated Continental currency that was worthless at the time. After the war was over, the U.S. government made good on the dollars. By the time trade connections resumed, he had amassed a fortune. He built two ships and began an export business to the West Indies and to Europe.""

""People jokingly told him to ""ship coal to Newcastle"". He did so during a miners' strike at the time, and his cargo was sold at a premium. At another time, practical jokers told him he could make money shipping gloves to the South Sea Islands. His ships arrived there in time to sell the gloves to Portuguese boats on their way to China.""

""This became evident when he started telling visitors that his wife had died (despite the fact that she was still alive) and that the woman who frequented the building was simply her ghost. In one notable episode, Dexter faked his own death to see how people would react. About 3,000 people attended Dexter's mock wake. Dexter did not see his wife cry, and after he revealed the hoax, he caned her for not grieving enough."" 

""The book contained 8,847 words and 33,864 letters, but no punctuation and its capitalization seemed random. At first, he handed his book out for free, but it became popular and was reprinted for sale eight times. In the second edition, Dexter added an extra page which consisted of 13 lines of punctuation marks with the instructions that readers could distribute them as they pleased.""

16-01-12,40nnnh,DD: Possible energy sector bankruptcies,"With oil prices looking less likely to rebound soon, I started looking for energy companies I think could be facing bankruptcy soon and would make good shorts.  I looked for companies with:

* a large debt load
* little cash on hand
* cash flows that would require multiple years to service debt
* a short track record (lenders won't give much leeway) 

Here is what I came up with:

~~**Parsley Energy (PE)**~~

- 123 mil in cash 
- 557 mil in debt 
- 32 mil MRQ cash flow 
- Founded in 2008, public since 2014
- Stupid fucking name

~~**Isramco (ISRL)**~~

- 26 mil in cash
- 106 mil in debt
- 5 mil MRQ cash flow
- Founded in 1989, expanded to U.S. in 1997

~~**Carrizo Oil &amp; Gas Inc (CRZO)**~~

- 2 mil in cash
- 1.4 bil in debt (!)
- 118 mil MRQ cash flow
- Founded in 1993, public since 1997

Williams Partners LP (WPZ) also looks like it is in terrible shape, with 17 bil in debt compared to 110 mil in cash and 605 mil MRQ cash flow.  However, I'm not exactly sure how screwed it will be. MLPs seem to follow their own set of rules that I don't understand.  Also, you'll be liable for their dividend if you short them, which could be annoying.  They might be worth looking into though.

What do you guys think?

UPDATE: After maxim's suggestion, I started looking into proven reserves for each company.  It looks like Parsley is in better shape than it would appear at first glance.  According to their most recent investor report, their proven reserves total 48 million barrels of oil, and they also have significant natural gas reserves.  They also appear to have a good hedging system in place to help stabilize their cash flows in the face of falling oil prices. 

Isramco's proven reserves also paint them in a better light.  They have 41 million barrels of oil equivalent, which would indicate they actually aren't too heavily leveraged. 

Carrizo's proven reserves are 151 million barrels of oil equivalent, and 481 million barrels of *probable* reserves.  $1.4 bil is a hell of a lot of debt, but it seems that they could service is it for now even at sub-$20/barrel prices.

TL;DR: I was wrong about these three companies, and they probably will not go bankrupt.  I'll do some more research and try to come up with some better options.

I am now considering when will be the best time to buy back into the market and with what stocks will be on the winning end of this down economy. Any thoughts?

Edit: I am looking at two stocks at the moment, Hawaiian Holdings (HA), once their stocks falls a little bit more, I think their stock will be very appealing and management has their heads on straight. The other is BKCC, high dividend yield for a low P/E ratio makes them a strong buy at the moment. Previously in another post that I had made, a contributor had mentioned Sotheby's (BID), looks interesting and I am investigating further.",1

16-01-12,40man9,Strong growth outlook to attract foreign investments to India,"The strong economic growth outlook of India built on efficient fiscal and monetary management and a progressive reform agenda is expected to attract both foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign portfolio investments (FPI) starting this year, Vikas Gautam, CEO, Aditya Birla Sun Life Asset Management Company Pte. Ltd told Gulf News in a recent interview.
“The government has been able to build a strong foundation for change which is quiet visible on the ground. Though a lot of reforms the government had envisaged have not gone through till now, but at the same time the foundation has been laid, and the result of that foundation will be visible in the next 12 to 18 months,” said Gautam. In its latest report, ‘Global Economic Prospects’, The World Bank has projected that India would remain comfortably the fastest growing large economy in 2016, at a rate more than a percentage point higher than China. The World Bank has projected the Indian economy to grow at 7.8 per cent in 2016 and China’s to grow at a more modest 6.7 per cent while the world economy as a whole would grow at 2.9 per cent.
Though the rupee depreciated last year compared to 2014, it largely managed to hold its ground compared to most other emerging market currencies. It is unlikely the rupee will face a massive depreciation as happened in 2013 when it slipped in excess of 20 per cent. Over the last two years, the RBI has been successful in curbing extreme speculative volatility out of the market.
“FDI and foreign portfolio allocations are expected to increase this year. There has been a lot of positive impact following the improved ratings as well as a number of countries from around the world are signing bilateral agreements with India to support infrastructure developments. Once infrastructure developments start, the ripple effects of that will get reflected on the capital markets for the simple reason the execution of infrastructure projects is going to be done by local companies,” said Gautam.
Unlike other emerging markets, the impact of future US interest rate hikes on capital flows out of India will be muted. The US is hiking rates because the economy is recovering. Historical data for the two decades show good growth in the US has meant strong growth prospects for India.
While future rate hikes are expected to have some immediate ripple effects, it is not likely to result in capital flight from India. On the contrary strong macroeconomic fundamentals are likely to attract more investors to India.
India is one of the few emerging markets where some of the largest pension funds either have allocated in the range of $5 billion (Dh18.36 billion) to $10 billion over the past 12 months.
“Looking from their perspective yields are negative or zero in most developed markets. They have to match liabilities for 30 to 40 years and there aren’t many markets that can give these funds yields in the range of 7 to 10 per cent for such longer period,” said Gautam.
In the past, India was part of tactical allocations for most institutional investors, but now it is increasingly becoming part of their core allocation strategies.

Middle East investments to surge
Dubai: India is expected to receive strong flow of investments from the Middle East as institutional investors, private offices and sovereign investors compare opportunities with other emerging markets said Vikas Gautam, CEO, Aditya Birla Sun Life Asset Management Company (ABSLAMC).
ABSLAMC has a 100 per cent wholly-owned subsidiary in Dubai called ABSLAMC Dubai that is regulated by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA). ABSLAMC Dubai services clients across the Middle East through its Dubai office.
“We have a very strong investor base in the Middle East, especially in the GCC. Investors are aware of the opportunities and we intend to offer products and services that suit the requirements of regional investors,” Gautam said.
The company offers investment options on both public markets including equities, fixed income and opportunities in alternate space too. Keeping up with the growing demand for exposure to India investments from investors in the Middle East, Asia and Canada, the company is planning to launch a couple of new funds. First will be a fund focused on Middle East and Asia investors, a 100 per cent India dedicated high growth fund that will focus on small and mid-cap sectors. Additionally the company is also launching this month an open-ended balance fund for Canadian investors with 60:40 equity bond composition.
With the growing FDI inflow and infrastructure investments, the Indian corporate sector is expected to benefit in terms of earnings. “As a consequence of this, corporate earnings will get rerated in India which will reflect on valuations on the capital markets,” said Gautam.

16-01-12,40oell,Year-Long YOLO: Automated Trading Project,"Here's what I've got:

* I am a currency trader that has used manual trading strategies for years. During the final quarter of 2015 I realized that I have far more fun/interest in automated trading. 
* I have developed some automated trades based on my prior experience. I have back-tested, and forward-tested these trades. Starting in mid December, these trades with an account that is currently around $9,000. 
* During 2016 I will be selling off assets and moving over my manual trading funds to contribute approximately $150,000 in additional funds. 
* I am going to log this process, probably with a monthly thread. This should give me extra motivation to keep things moving-- particularly the asset sales and account deposits. 
* I have nothing for sale, nor will I ever have anything for sale. I am also not posting signals or my specific trading strategies. If anyone is curious as to how to build their own, I will comment on that. 

I know the vast majority of posts on here are about manual equity trades. However, here's why I'm posting this on /r/wallstreetbets:

* Even though it's a different style of trading, it's still trading. A lot of the same principles apply. 
* No other subreddit or trading forum is comfortable talking about dollars and cents. While percentage profits are obviously important, dollars are what I find motivational. I want to look at what I'm making versus what other people are making. 

On the afternoon of 2016-01-07 I started a new account dedicated solely to my portfolio of automated trades and moved $8,736 over to it. Prior to this, I generated a combined 13.6% ($1,046.11) on the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th.

So here is the latest update with my forgotten 900 dollar account that I ran across now turned into 14.6k. The first two days of this week turned into a mess because trading has been a mess. I've managed to meek out with profits. I bought 19 contracts of 192 at 2.04 on Monday at the open. I held the contracts all day and ended up stuck because the Monday close rallied and continued into Tuesday morning. I decided to double down and I went all in with the remaining money I had and added 61 contracts to the 19. The prices can be seen in the picture. 

Here are the other preceding posts:

16-01-12,40oghf,Excel Stock Model,"I’ve seen some people share some cool excel tools over the last couple months so thought I would share this one I was working on a few months ago. I never really had a full plan with the model except to pull in stock data, which eventually led to adding more features. 

To use the model:

The Cover tab just gives some basic info on the stocks you want. Pick the 5 tickers that you want to compare and the headers are all dropdowns. Change those before refreshing the data. 

Also, refreshing the data takes some time (10-20 seconds), probably because of inefficient VBA and just pulling a lot of info off yahoo.

Prices tab lets you choose a range of dates and you can click on/off which stocks to show.

Past earnings and stock movement are at the bottom. 

You can change the # days. (Also, it was a bit tough pulling when the actual earnings reports came out, so those could be off sometimes. It is based on filings in yahoo finance that end with the word “Report”)

The rest of the tabs (Chart Data) are what I really spent most of the time on. I built it to be a research tool, and educational at the same time. I wanted to make all the statements as “Visual” as possible. Now, I apologize that there are some features that I could add, like options to exclude certain line items, but I don’t have too much time to work on the model. Also, the chart formats are not all consistent, as I was messing around with what looks best.


Please let me know what you think or if you have any suggestions! Also, sorry if you get errors with the macros, I am incredibly novice on VBA and can try fixing issues you might have.

16-01-12,40oivj,Comment on my analysis,"Somewhat new to investing. Have been lurking here for about a month just reading and trying to be able to follow the conversation. Anyway, back in 2009 a friend recommended I buy Citigroup cheap believing it would recover and I did purchase about $5K worth which has nicely appreciated since and just sits there.  Then a few days ago, some articles caught my eye stating Citigroup is perhaps very undervalued. I decided to not take the articles and face value and instead try to perform an analysis based on the things I have been learning here to try to apply it to real life, to see if I should buy even more. Here is my analysis, which seems to indicate that perhaps Citigroup is indeed undervalued. Please feel free to tell me what I did right and wrong. 

Citigroup’s P/E is around 10. This is roughly the same as JPMorgan, but lower than Bank of America, Wells Fargo and USB. Positive factor.

Dividend yield is about 0.43%, which means their dividends are only nominal. Negative factor (unless you like this for tax reasons). 

P/E/G/ ratio is 0.18. Since this is under 1, positive factor.

Book value is $59/share. Way higher than current prices. Positive factor.

CEO has recently said that China is not a material risk for C’s business. Also that market perception of Citi’s risk to emerging markets in general is exaggerated and not well understood by investors, who assume Citi has tons of EM risk. He explains in detail why, I cannot follow though. But assuming true, positive factor.

The recent interest rate increase will purportedly help Citi’s margins. Positive factor. 

According to Insider Monkey, 16 billionaire hedge funds are LONG on Citi (I do understand that because hedge funds are not required to disclose their shorts, this could be just a neutral factor).

Citigroup will at some point soon get the permission of the Fed to buy back a lot of stock.

I own a bunch of Qihoo360(QIHU) stocks, and they're planning to go private for $77 a share. What are some things I need to do/think about?

* Do I need to sell my stocks on etrade for current price of $70?
* Do I need to do anything at all? Will I automatically get $77/share for all my shares without anything?
* What happens if I don't sell? Do I lose everything?
* How much time do I have before I need to act?
* Why isn't the current price at $77 if it's been announced the buyback will be at that price?

16-01-13,40rzws,Question: After Hours Trading,"I'm a long-time redditor, but inactive for a few years.  This seems like the perfect question for reddit, though... so here goes!

Peregrine Pharmaceuticals (PPHM, I am long term invested) has, for the last two days, jumped 25-30 percent in ""pre-market"" trading according to Google.  Yesterday, after showing this gain, it opened at the same place as the prior close, and the price barely moved all day.

So... My questions are: Who is trading after hours?  Essentially, who is making money off this jump?  Can anyone trade after hours?  If so, how?  Background: I used ShareBuilder to purchase my position in this stock.  I pick long-term positions, and don't intend to try to day trade... but this jump would allow me a chance to get out of the long-term position (which I entered far too early) without a loss.

If not, why does this select market exist?  Doesn't it seem... fishy?  As in, some people have access to this jump in price, while the price conveniently returns to normal once general trading opens...  (double fishy if it does it again today...)

16-01-13,40tzti,Apple Eyeing Time Warner (TWX) Acquisition,"&gt; A source close to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has indicated that one of Apple’s executives, Eddy Cue, has been watching Time Warner closely to see if they decide to put themselves up for sale. If Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) could in fact acquire the company, it would likely take more than the $85 per share offer they received back in 2014; perhaps as much as $105 per share, equating to a total price of over $80 billion. Sure, Apple can afford this, but do they want to blow their cash on a media company?

&gt; The acquisition of Time Warner would make sense on many levels. It would give Apple, CNN, Time Warner Sports, HBO, Warner Bros. and more. These are all incredible properties that could help them launch a streaming TV service and perhaps attract other networks to join in. It will be interesting to see if anything comes of these rumors over the next several weeks, or if Time Warner decides not to sell and instead just spin off their HBO segment.

16-01-13,40u53t,"Let Uncle Pegasus explain to you what's happening here in very simple terms.","The world is massively in debt.... To itself.  Many times over, like a car full of stoners who all jokingly said, ""Yeah man, I'll totally owe you $100k if you do that.""  
  
It's all cute until they start making actual contracts and agreements based on how much debt their owed by all the rest.  Finally, when this bullshit has gone on so long it has become a way of life, one of the stoners tries to cash in a debt.  ""Hey man, can I get a little of that $2 million you owe me.  I want to show this other guy I'm good for it so I can get some of his Doritos.""  
  
And he says, ""Well, hold on man.  I don't actually have that money.  Let me see what I can do.  Hey man, can I get some of that $4 million you owe me?  This other guy wants to see some of the money.""  
  
And soon the whole car degenerates into bickering and bullshit as they all realize each one is full of shit and no one actually has any money at all.  
  
After a calamitous argument, the car finally resets down to what hard assets they each actually own: a used pipe and half a bag of Doritos.  What so many highly paid professionals fail to realize is this: money is imaginary, and only useful as a fluid for debts and accomplishments to flow through society - if the money isn't being used to lubricate the machinery of society, it (and the host) dies just like a body in shock.  
  
-------  
  
As well, the biggest economic experiment of our entire civilization is ending cataclysmically: zero percent interest (soon to be negative percent interest).  
  
Our global economy got its bullshit called back in 2008, and the band-aid: to print free QE money, has propped up the stock market but not solved the underlying problems.  
  
The increasing wealth inequality is creating an unsustainable situation where a tiny tiny few own all the wealth and are the noble class to the other 6.999 billion... But what incentive do the rest have to work hard if they can't afford anything?  
  
And thus, the global economy is finally collapsing... Back down to the half bag of Doritos it came from.  
  
There will be a temporary flight into the US Dollar in coming months (possibly years) which will mean the US stock market won't totally crumble, but it will still be bad.  Ultimately hard assets are going to rule the day as the silly Keynesian make believe game crumbles around us all and we realize we can't actually make up exponential amounts of money from nothing.... When there are superior alternatives available.  
  
So enjoy the end result of your Wall Street Martingale strategy where you assume you can acquire tiny gains forever, while ignoring the increasing potential for total ruin.  The stock market has always gone up, right?  And we all know past performance guarantees future return.  
  
The future is not in make believe Federal Reserve notes, nor shiny rocks.  Welcome to the future and the trumpet which will signal its arrival.  Best of luck to you all; those who have paid attention to my warnings and insights through the years will profit handsomely.

He called me last Feb and suggested I but a considerable amount of stock in Chevron (CVX) Conoco (COP) Oneok (ONEOK) and Cenovas (CVE).
I am now down over 50%.  I Know it was MY mistake to do this and to listen to him and to buy something I was uneasy about.
He had a good argument, mainly that Oil Stocks ALWAYS went back up.  
One problem is that these stocks were up at the time, but had just started to fall.  I thought, yeah, he is right, they do always go back up.  Well, they havent in a year.  And 2016 doesnt look any better, based on my research.  
I am recently retired and I dont have 5-10 years to wait for a rebound.  Truthfully, I might now have 3 years to wait.

Should I sell them, take my losses and move on?  Using the losses to balance out my taxes?  Should I wait, for some unknown period of time, knowing that it might be years before they recover.
They would have to rebound 100% now, for me just to break even.
Yeah, I am pissed, but I am also guilty of letting someone else sway me to do something I really didnt want to do.  My bad.

This week I will admit has seen a larger decrease than I expected in the price, but this is part of overall market forces than IDRA specifically.

The good news is:


* IDRA are presenting at JPM tomorrow
* IDRA bounced hard off it's major resistance at 1.96,and is trading after hours at 10% up on this level
* There are rumors from JPM that ABBV is interested in a partnership or maybe a buyout - this would be huge, I don't think we'd be looking at less than $6 per share
* There have been recent upgrades, Wedbush gave a $6 buy rating.
* There were some huge block buys on the L2 in the last 30 mins, around 10x the amount of ask,I suspect that the stock has been manipulated for the last few days to allow the institutions to hoover up stocks at a discount
* Julian Baker of Baker Brothers biotech investors recently picked up 21,000 shares @ $3

After a couple of red days, and general market woes, the finish today signalled a potential turnaround for IDRA, and I would expect by Friday this will be back closer to 2:65, with 3:20 buy start of Feb

Unless their business model is completely fucked up, it just seems like FB or AAPL or MSFT or someone would come in and buy them at some point.  The Twitter format is fairly easily duplicated, but having the format isn't going to get the userbase - and that's what makes TWTR (or any social media company) valuable.

From a user standpoint, Twitter seems better positioned to me to capitalize on advertising dollars than something like Facebook.  I don't mind reading 140 character (although I understand they may mess with that) blurbs from companies that I've chosen to follow to get specials, discounts, advance sales, etc.  But I do find it annoying when those same companies litter my Facebook feed.

Twitter also seems like a much better platform for celebrity endorsements.  Having a celeb with a couple million followers tweet out ""Just had the Goji smoothie at #SmoothieKing - soooo good and soooo healthy"" is going to reach a ton of people who value that celebrity's opinion.",3

The stock market has been cruising upwards for awhile it seems but underneath individual stocks have been getting killed! Literally, going bankrupt, or taking major losses. I have somehow, luckily, survived stocks like ACI, NBG, FNMA, USO and the likes getting out before major losses hit, and hit hard. I have been a value seeker, and I consider myself a rational investor, (of course buying other names than the above mentioned), buying when I thought there was plenty of fundamental value in certain stocks after having been crushed, but there is something else going on under the surface. There is something they don't tell the average investor beyond using a condom, or an ETF.

Private equity is the only opportunity I see, but then it is already a game of the greater fool.

(X-post from r/personalfinance),"Starting out individual stock investing for the first time. I’m thinking to buy 1 or 2 of these large, blue chip company stocks. https://hellomoney.co/portfolio/4dc621-simply-invest-in-large-companies

I hear large cap stocks historically have 6% annual returns, and that seems like a good place to start for someone like me. I am not looking for any clever moves or a wild ride yet, but just want to get my hands wet to see how buying/selling stocks look and feel like.

However, these large cap stocks are likely included in my 401K portfolio already (Fidelity Spartan 500). Is it a bad idea to buy stocks that are already in my fund portfolio?

My 401K has a balance of $47K, and I am thinking about buying two of these stocks with a $10K budget. Is this overlap too big?",2

16-01-13,40po3p,Want to make changes to my 401 based on upcoming trends.,"So as the title states, I want to change some of my funds in my 401 ASAP.

A lot of things are pointing to a massive econimic downswing coming up.  I honestly believe we could see the dow under 10000 in the next 1.5 years.  Based on actual data (price of oil, trend of price of oil, trend of train freight, jobs, etc) I would like to shift my ENTIRE 401 to something EXTREMELY secure for the time being.

Yes, I understand I am attempting to time the market.  Yes, I understand all your eggs in one basket is a bad idea.  Right now my 401 is mixed in 5 Vanguard funds evenly and for the most part they all are about an even mix.  I am also young enough where I do not have a significant amount in my 401, but I plan to continue contributing.

What is the safest fund, a guaranteed bond if possible, I can put my money into in order to act on my data and thoughts?

The bad news has been at its worst, and there is nothing bad to report on currently. We're going to see CMG climb back the same way it fell. This is not a small correction or temporary bounce. We are going to see nothing but mostly positive news about CMG going forward. We are going to see PT's change back to the early 600's. There will be a slight drop again when earnings come out... and we all know that CMG has had, and will continue to have a significant drop in sales. This will be corrected, but not any time soon. This is still a great company to own, if you can afford it. Today, I would buy to open the CMG 1/22 calls between 440-450 for a strike. We can have a spread at several different strikes to make the play safer. Here is the catch though. Don't own the stock just yet (If you are looking to call shares away). CMG's ER will be out around 2/2, and we DO NOT wan't to own the stock OR any contracts through this ER. Instead, we can take advantage of the share price increase and buy puts just prior to CMG's ER, but we need to see where we end up before we do so. Good luck, hope we can make some $.",2

16-01-14,40v3k4,"New to investing - how does a stock being ""overvalued"" affect anything?","When I see for example, tesla stock selling for $208 a share I think ""okay, TSLA is worth $208 per share"" not ""TSLA is only worth $171 per share because the Model S sold x units last year and ..."".  Sort of like how a $100 bill is just a piece of paper, but our society recognizes it as an equivalent to $100.  If people are buying TSLA at $208, then why isn't it equivalent to $208?

I'm fairly new to investing, and I have an engineering/mathematics background which means I don't always draw the same conclusions from what I see in the stock market that trained investors do.  For example: I would calculate a stock's value by plotting the sale values over a certain timeframe in a histogram, and then determine a value based on the mean and modal values of that figure.  I'd estimate an actual value of $225 per share +/- $10 for TSLA using this method.  And if you look at TSLA over say 3 months, 1 year, and the tail end of 5 years - there is a pretty predictable pattern seemingly unrelated to this supposed $171 per share.  By chosing companies likely to have long term success and by buying at low points and selling at high points I have been doing pretty well (this week aside).  I am currently working on software to apply various data interpretations to see if that helps me.  What are the risks and benefits of this strategy?

What math is used to determine these actual value estimations?  How concrete/proven is this method?",15

&gt;Kevin O'Leary, scoured the list of 1,800 ETFs to find one suitable for his family's investment trust, but he says he couldn't find a single one. So, he created his own family of funds called O’Shares, which debuted in 2015.

&gt; ""I have a rule in diversification: I never want to own more than five percent in any one stock. That's why all the ETFs I looked at didn't work."" 

&gt;“If you go back and look at the data over the last 40 years, 71 percent of the returns from the market have come from dividends not capital appreciation, so I want only to own dividend-paying stocks.""

&gt; ""I also want to be 20 percent less volatile than the market and I want total sectorial diversification.""

&gt; When backtesting O'Shares for the past 10 years, it performed well during times of market turmoil. “It's about 20 percent less volatile than the market, which is what I care about. And it pays 50 percent more yield than the market does.""

16-01-13,40tb1s,ConocoPhillips - potentially a good buy long term once they cut the dividend?,"I used to own COP until last year, when I sold it at a loss as I felt that a recovery in oil was not coming soon. 

As of the most recent quarter, COP doesn't generate enough cash to cover its dividend and its CAPEX. Last quarter, it generated $1.9 billion in operating cash, but CAPEX was $2.2 billion and dividends paid were $0.9 billion. 

It has been issuing debt to cover the shortfall, and its long-term debt has been ballooning. As credit tightens for oil companies, I suspect that COP might possibly cut most or all of its dividend to conserve cash. 

My strategy is to buy puts on COP that expire around the September 2016. I'm betting that COP will cut the dividend by then, especially if oil remains this low (and the indicators tell us that there is still excess supply in the market). Once COP cuts its dividend, I'll sell my puts and take a long position. 

Long term, I believe that oil will recover, but prices will remain depressed for some time to come and companies like COP can't expect to keep borrowing to preserve the dividend. I know that the CEO has said that that conserving the dividend is the company's #1 priority, but I'm not sure how long COP can last in this environment, given that they spun off their downstream assets into Phillips 66 several years ago and have no other means of generating cash besides asset sales and heavy borrowing. 

Timing will be everything, though. ",0

It seems she's been a regular at this magical store for a while. She was surprised to see me, obviously. For a moment it seemed like I had telepathic powers for some reason.

What he spends is about $600K/year. He wants to lock in these prices for 5 years, so $3M total. Right now, he's bought UCO, a 2x leveraged oil ETF. I explained all the issues about it, regarding roll yield and stuff. He's aware, but has decided to stick to the leveraged ETF because he can theoretically only spend half the $3M to get exposure. I haven't looked at the oil futures market to see what contango is, but I made sure he knew if oil even just stayed flat at current prices, UCO would lose 2x the contango %age on an annual basis, but compounded on a daily basis.

Can anyone here suggest a better way to hedge 5 years worth of that jet fuel that doesn't involve the futures market? He wants ETF's. I'd like to propose a better way to do it, not sure if it's possible though.",0

16-01-14,40w407,strategy,"Before the crash I had long-dated ATM SPX strangles which were profitable.  Then they quickly lost money and I found myself with a deep in the money short put and a way of money worthless short call.

I sold puts on the way down, losing money on all. When the SPY was at 201 I sold 2x 66 day 192 put (thinking I had enough margin or error and the market was done falling. nope)

I eventually found myself with approx $75k delta of short puts and a loss of $3.5k for the past 2 weeks. The maximum theoretical loss was much bigger. The total was $150k max theoretical loss between the strangle put and the 2x SPY put.

So then I had an epiphany

I wanted to keep the delta $75k the same to take advantage of the market rebound which I anticipate will be soon.. But I don't want to lose everything and be in debt should the market crash more. 

So what I did was: 

keep the short calls *they will likely never go ITM being that they are &gt;7% ATM

cover the sort puts at large loss

Then I went to the Jan 2018 index options and bought enough deep in the money calls to keep the delta around $75k but now my maximum theoretical loss is much less. Because the are deep in the money, the IV crush will be much less too. The premium cost is roughly $1.3k for the first year (jan 2017)

My max loss is such that if the market were to go to zero I would still have 50% left in cash

&gt; Meanwhile, the price of the underlying equities in index funds is rising, though no one is sure exactly why. Research by S&amp;P Capital IQ, as of Dec. 31, found stocks that were in the Russell 2000 were trading at a 50 percent premium to stocks that were not, up from 12 percent in 2006. The statistics are based on median price-to-book ratio.

&gt; Basically, if an investor wants to sell an index fund as the market declines, the managers of the fund might have trouble selling some of the stocks in the fund. An active manager could choose to sell any stock in her fund and thus potentially navigate a downturn better. But an index fund manager has to sell exactly the shares held in the index in the same proportion as demanded by the index. If the fund manager doesn't find a buyer for, say, shares of ExxonMobil, the price of ExxonMobil will fall until a buyer is found.

What are your thoughts on this? Does this mean people who invested in index and ETF are screwed if the market crashes?",22
16-01-14,40w4nh,I Suck at This.,"So over the past few weeks I have been using Investopaedia's Stock Simulator to try and see how the market would work and how well I could apply the knowledge I'v learned from reading books about investing. The one thing I have taken away from this is...

I fucking suck at investing. I just cant seem to do it. The one good stock purchase I bought was Medtronic PLC, the rest have done nothing but make me lose money. I don't know how to purchase good stocks. I have looked at numbers, chart patterns, trends and more but every stock I seem to buy only goes down. I realize that a few weeks is nothing in the investment world but I was really hoping I could learn how to find a fast growing stock. Im more of an aggressive investor. 

Since this is a ""Stock"" Simulator I am unable to split my cash into and index fund or bonds, its all common stocks. I know that those are safer options and ones I am more likely to pick in the future but right now I really want to see how buying common, individual stocks would work out for me. I have been diversifying my portfolio as well.

Any tips or even advice that you guys have would mean the world for me. I am really trying my best to learn about this. I have started reading ""The Intelligent Investor"" and have read about 4 other books on investing and I have picked up some good tips from there but nothing about buying common, individual stocks.

16-01-14,40y6xi,Utilities earnings plays,"Here I will outline why I think Utilities, especially those on the east coast, will have terrible Q4 earnings and may make excellent option plays.

If you don't recall, the months of October through December were abnormally warm; December posted record highs throughout much of the US and November posted temperatures much above average (especially east of the Mississippi River). 

Utility companies make their bread and butter by selling electricity to just about everyone. Some of them also make money in the energy sector and when storms hit places outside their area of operations.

Last quarter, east coast utilities like $DUK and $D missed earnings in part because of the lack of storms hitting the coast and lower margins. This quarter I'm expecting them to miss again due to higher than average temperatures which drives winter and fall demand down. -&gt; Due to the fact that temperatures in November and December were much warmer than average, I believe electrical demand was lower than expected and that these companies will miss their earnings estimates.

**Earnings dates:** $DUK 2/18 (unconfirmed); $D 2/04

16-01-14,40y9lb,Heapspray is back with a new powerball scam!,"Hey guys, i wanted to update you all on how everything is going. First, i wanted to give you an update on the powerball pool scam i had running.

It went poorly. I had the IT department here find out about the scam and were basically blackmailing me, although they didnt really ask for anything specific. They mostly wanted to tease me. We used the opportunity as a bonding experience and I found out that the IT department here is more corrupt than I am. I didnt want to risk anything so I actually bought the tickets.

I talked to my IT guys for a long time, it turns out that they have scripts that search the network (somehow) for reddit usage on company machines and pulls the username and cross references it to a list of interesting subreddits (they are looking mostly for gonewild posts) but wallstreetbets are also on the list I guess. Pete and I have become pretty close and he actually shared with me a few of his finds. One of our executive assistants it turns out is a famous gonewild user.


Now, on to the next powerball scheme.

If you want to run a legit powerball pool at work, ALWAYS be the person to buy the tickets. If you win anything over 1,300, have them deduct the maximum amount of taxes from the win UP FRONT.

Now split that amount with your coworkers and tell them you will take care of doing all of the taxes. There are ways to get around paying gambling taxes that are very easy to do and it could mean you making thousands and thousands of dollars more than your poor coworkers who also won.


1. Deduct your gambling losses. Seriously just make up some shit. Do you know the laws on deducting gambling losses? IRS wants you to keep a spreadsheet. That's it. You don't even need proof of losses. Just write in a spreadsheet that you went to a casino and lost 10,000 on the craps table. Problem solved.


Now you get a bigger piece of the pie.


Not as great as my original office pool scam, but still an angle.

YOU ARE WELCOME.",14

He stalks this sub and hates when folks talk about him. So, he got banned from SurgeTraders for the same reason we banned him. Autistic, brash, and overconfident. Without further delay:

&gt;The best way to describe the situation was an analogy I have earlier.. @angrytesla you know how sometimes when you're in an argument with someone and their strategy is to talk over you as loud as possible, cut you off, and think that whoever speaks most wins? That was Gabriel's personality. It got to the point where most people that would discuss oil and other trading styles etc would purposely not post in the channels because Gabriel would belittle or cut their confidence with phrases like: ""today is rough only a professional trader can figure this out today"" or ""you're just a newbie it's okay I'll teach you I trade millions a day"" and then followed up with stuff such as, now this is what I'm doing today... Basically lowering people's confidence to manipulate them to follow his trades and strategies because hey, he's the pro here and only pros can trade in this market environment. WRONG!

&gt;Plenty of people have DMed myself as well as Nick bagholding UWTI, OAS, etc because Gabriel had told them he was so bullish that it'd practically be a swing trade. Nick and I had to switch to just saying keep tight stops half the day to prevent it. Upon auditing his charts (he never posted entries/exits.. I wonder why) it seems that he was wrong a majority of time, and most of his lessons/charting was using historical charts to prove points he hand picked to show what he wanted them to.

&gt;He has asked for mod promotion multiple times (already a red flag) and when I decided to follow up after getting multiple reports I asked for any proof or audits of some of his trades and he said he'd fax me an NDA as his trades were within a company and not shareable. When I actually gave him a fax number (maybe he expected me not to have one) he claimed he no longer wanted to become a mod. About this time I pressed him to prove other claims he's made about his background and he immediately said he didn't want to disclose the information as he was not longer going for mod. At that point it was obvious he was a fraud and I basically said don't DM anyone your trade ideas keep it in public.. And he said he'd take a break from surge. Expecting him to do his original plan (he said his agent said it'd be easier to publish his book if he had a following), I made the call he was going to try to market/spam our users before his false reputation was exposed, so I banned him.

&gt;There are other details like how he flat out asked for props from people in the main channel (not okay to do), how he attempted to use his prop count to justify a promotion, how he sent me photos of him next to a car (probably not his) in a parking lot showing how he bought it with his gains, how he sent a photo of his wife's engagement ring (probably not hers) saying he bought that trading, how he sent photos of a family he donated to for Christmas saying I'm a great guy and genuine why would you not mod me? Etc.

&gt;Plenty of red flags, but in the end I was hesitant to ban earlier as he had so many supporters. I will say through most logs I've received, most of what he was teaching could be learned in a week or two easy.. So feel free to ask Nick or myself for technical analysis advice, we'll gladly help you.

He also tried to swing his E-dick in my face with his 7 figure trading account. Which, I hate to break it to him, but that's not impressive. Most of us have 7 figure accounts and some with 9 figures. BOY U GOT ME.

But I'm sure he already has a story to tell us all to gain dem sweet internet followers.

16-01-14,40ypgv,"B&amp;E | Looking Beyond the Label ""Algorithmic Trading""","By Dr. Ajay Shah

At the EMF 2015 conference, I attended a talk by Pradeep Yadav, where he presented a paper: Raman, Robe, Yadav, 2015. This paper analyses algorithmic traders (""AT"") and manual traders (""MT"") on one of the world's largest electronic limit order book exchanges, the National Stock Exchange (""NSE"").

NSE is an ideal laboratory for studying these questions, as it is a simple plain limit order book market, without the confusion caused by market makers. In addition, the overall equity market structure is simple, with two exchanges (NSE and BSE) where NSE has dominant market share. The complexities of the fragmented order flow and multiple trading venues, of the US, are not present. At NSE, both spot and futures trade in the same time zone, with orders emanating from the same co-location facility, which also facilitates research. NSE data has thus shaped up to be a very nice foundation for understanding markets, in recent years, with some of the cleanest micro-structure work getting done here.

The Puzzle

Pradeep Yadav and his coauthors find that under conditions of market stress, ATs withdraw from the market. This immediately lends itself to a pejorative interpretation: ""ATs are good for liquidity under good times, but are quick to withdraw when the going gets difficult, and this is creating a new set of problems"".

I wondered how this squares with a powerful result from Aggarwal &amp; Thomas, 2014. This is a modern causal econometrics paper, and in this they find that the incidence of mini flash crashes goes down when there is more AT. They look for mini flash crashes defined as 2%, 5% and 10% declines of the price within a five minute window (see Table 6, page 28). All three coefficients are negative; more AT gives fewer flash crashes. For the 2% and 10% case, the differences are not statistically significant, but for the case of a 5% drop of prices in 5 minutes, bigger AT gives a statistically and economically significant decline in the incidence of flash crashes.

Both papers seem to have persuasive empirical strategies. How do we square the results? How is it that ATs are more likely to step away in difficult times (Raman, Robe, Yadav) but at the same time how it is that when there is more AT, mini flash crashes are less frequent (Aggarwal, Thomas)?

A better classification system

In order to figure out what's going on, I think we should break with the classification AT vs. MT. Instead, it's better to think in terms of simple, mechanistic trading strategies vs. complex strategies that involve human judgment. For the purpose of argument, let's call these ""SI"" for simple vs. ""CO"" for complex strategies.

Let's start with the old world, before algorithmic trading. In that world, we very much had many humans running SI strategies and many humans running CO strategies. `Technical analysis', and other trend following mechanistic strategies, were around well before algorithmic trading came along!

As Friedman, 1953, reminded us, there is a Darwinian process at work where speculators who lose money tend to exit the market. Because markets are competitive, the dumb adherence to a SI strategy would induce losses, and the people who did this would exit the market. Hence, the only sensible approach for a trader who uses a SI strategy is to either stop some times (i.e. have a ""kill switch"") or switch to a CO strategy at certain times.

In the good old days, SI speculators had ""kill switches"". When the market got weird, they would just stop trading. Nobody expected a simple trend following speculator to behave unchanged when volatility changed or when big news broke. We had trading floors where a boss would shut down some strategies from time to time. This was akin to a ""kill switch"" applied to a large number of SI strategies.

All that has happened with algorithmic trading is that we now have powerful clerks, i.e. computers, who are the foot soldiers implementing SI strategies. Nothing else has changed. Humans are still in charge!

Some human traders keep a swarm of SI strategies under leash, and when market conditions get difficult, they hit the kill switch. Some of them switch to CO strategies when the going gets difficult, and because CO strategies are much harder to program, they may well do this trading by hand. Some bosses of trading floors yank hundreds of SI strategies when the going gets weird.

Resolving the puzzle

There were always SI strategies and CO strategies. These have been around ever since organised financial trading began. In the older data, we are not able to disentangle the two.

In recent years, the SI strategies have gotten automated. We have reduced the use of humans in mechanistic tasks, and got computers to do this clerical work. For the first time in human history, we are now seeing a flag on orders where orders from SI strategies are now called ""AT"" orders. The CO strategies continue to be mostly done by hand, as it's quite hard doing this programming.

There is nothing wrong or unusual in SI strategies backing out of the market when conditions become confusing. SI strategies can only work in peaceful times. A trader who ran SI strategies all the time would exit the market as his wealth would run out (Friedman, 1953).

SI strategies done through AT give us more eyeballs looking at the millions of traded products in the modern exchange environment. When there's a dislocation in a market (e.g. a crash in the futures price), immediately, hundreds of traders come through with a mechanistic response (reverse cash and carry arbitrage), which stabilises the price. In contrast, in the manual world, the field of view of each human was limited, and when a little crash got started, there were fewer people available to interfere with it. This gave more mini flash crashes in the pre-AT world. This is how both statements are correct:

1. In times of market stress, the AT orders shy away (Raman, Robe, Yadav, 2015)
2. Greater AT intensity reduces the incidence of mini flash crashes (Aggarwal &amp; Thomas, 2014).

I'm looking for some serious help into how I can open and operate a hedge fund or an investment fund.  We want to do things like various forms of investing capital, managing money and possibly offer financial instruments.  Basically I want to figure out the best way to structure the company to give us (my partners and I) flexibility to invest in all sorts of assets with our capital.

For example, We would like to offer people 1 year 8% or 10% notes, and use the money they give me to invest in things such as tangible real estate, possibly ETFs or securities etc.

I know its not a simple task, but any pointers on where to start or what steps to take would be great.  I need to figure out what I need to become a small fund/company.  I want to know what type of licensing and what I would need access to, so that we could do this.

For some background, I have degrees in Econ, Finance and Accounting including masters and MBA.  I do various forms of investing including managing and investing in real estate.  My business partners and friends have a loose informal group where we share ideas for investments and track our progress.  We have a track record and have investors interested in our investments and ideas.  At this point we want to pool our capital, go legit and start a company/fund and possibly branch out to help people earn money like us.  My partners have varied backgrounds including wall street, finance, real estate, and owners of small businesses.

Reason for my question is that after doing some research, its hard to come by a comprehensive guide to actually get the ball rolling.

16-01-15,41224a,MU and DDD - Missed stops - what next?,"Hey stocks, long time lurker here, asking for advice for the first time.   I used to work as a day trader, but this is my first go at traditional trading, and I made a big mistake.

Late in Dec, I picked up both MU (@13.7) and DDD (@8.62) looking for support plays near their lows.  My original plan was to put tight, yet comfortable stops under both these stocks' previous lows, so if they sank I'd take minimal losses and be able to reassess if there was value on the long side there.

Unfortunately, as it turns out, I neglected to put the stops in immediately, and as the market tanked, they overshot my exit point and now I'm in an uncomfortable position.

Fundamentally, I think both stocks are quality and undervalued relative to their peers.  Please correct me if I'm wrong, as fundamental analysis isn't my strength when it comes to trading.

At this point, I'm kind of frozen, believing that there's inherit value in these companies over the long run, but knowing momentum is against me (and there are no recent support levels from which to plan another stopping point). 

I realize I've become emotionally vest in my decision, as I've been expecting a market correction, but the fact that it happened immediately after entering my first trading positions has me rattled (I also had 1 position with a stop that triggered and is currently trading higher - rough week).  

As it is, my decision making confidence is low right now, and I'd appreciate any input on exit strategies, or valuations for these companies.

16-01-14,40z5h2,Newbie Question: Is it wise to continue investing in periodic increments despite a projected downward trend?,"Hi everyone!  I'm new to this and trying to learn, so I hope you can bear with me. :)

I've recently started investing and put some money into a Vanguard target-risk fund (60-40 stock-bond allocation).  I was made to understand that this is too risk-averse for my age (late 20s) but I wanted to take baby steps as a newbie.  The plan was to keep adding $1,500 every month into the fund.  When I'm more knowledgeable and comfortable, then I intend to adjust my portfolio into something with smaller expense ratios and more risk that I can allocate and rebalance on my own.  The goal of my investment is retirement.

My question is this.  The market seems to be on a downward trend.  I don't know how long this will last.  I can afford to wait it out, but is it wise to continue with my plan to keep adding $1500 into the fund?  Or should I hold onto cash and put the $1500 in a savings account, or buy something ""safer"" like a bond fund?  Some people told me to hold onto cash and then buy when the market dips further, but this means I have to attempt to time the market.

Any advice would be much appreciated!

Under the terms of the settlement, Goldman will pay a $2.385 billion civil monetary penalty, make $875 million in cash payments, and provide $1.8 billion in consumer relief.

The bank also said that its fourth-quarter earnings results will be reduced by approximately $1.5 billion. To put that in perspective, analysts had been expecting the bank to report net income of $1.63 billion.

This is the second time in the last six months that this has happened — remember, stocks fell 10% back in August in just a few days — and these two corrections in such a short period of time don't look good, historically.
In an afternoon email on Wednesday, Rich Barry, floor governor at the NYSE — citing commentary from floor legend Art Cashin — wrote:

""Allow me to cut and paste an interesting and ominous piece from Arthur's morning comments: 'Jason Goepfert, the outstanding pilot of SentimenTrader dug into his incredibly extensive files to uncover a rather rare condition. He noted that the indices have had two 10% corrections in a rather short span. That has only happened three times in the last 100 years. Unfortunately, those occurrences were in 1929, 2000 and 2008. As you may recall, those were not particularly good years for the bulls.' Oh boy. Perhaps this time will be different.""

However, looking at their dividend payouts, it seems like IVV has a better track record - last payout was 2.45% (http://etfdb.com/etf/IVV/) as opposed to VOO's 2.27% (http://etfdb.com/etf/VOO/).

16-01-15,412jq2,my brief analysis on the state of the markets,"*Disclaimer: I do not pretend to be right or wrong, it's just another point of view, and perhaps you should evaluate if what I am saying makes or doesn't make sense, and trade/invest accordingly. Maybe I'm saying some pieces that you are missing... also I am sorry for may poor english*

The state of the markets is a lot more focused on oil, than on china or earnings or whatever catalyst you may think of:

- low oil doesn't drive up sales for consumer goods, as one could have guessed, and also those savings in oil doesn't go to Investment. (this is bad)

- China isn't growing enough, and so the oversupply wil never meet the demand of energy

- low oil, actually makes more harm then good, because of lost jobs, lost salaries, those are the ones that make a real difference when the data comes out

- Saudis are fine with low oil, why do they do that? Because they do not tolerate that someone could profit only if oil is higher than $50. (i.e. some american companies).

Saudis have supplies for 1 or 2 years, and their production cost is around $10-15

So, what are they doing? They keep to mantain the oversupply thus driving the prices lower, because an oversupply will meet with the demand at a lower point ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand ).

Most oil related companies will go bankrupt: this is a field where you need a lot of money to operate, so you need to take billions in loans, the debt/equity of the industry is way higher than the one of other industries.

They go bankrupt, lenders won't see their money back, a lot of value will be lost. (short term)

Why do they drive prices low? Because, now, the requirements for margin of safety will be higher, and so a lot more money will be needed to operate with safety, given that the Saudis are *in fact* injecting volatility to the system, so the previous mathematical models are way less reilable.

So, no more investment from investors/banks/firms/etcetc -&gt; no possibility in exploring and expanding (or, *ceteris paribus*, it will be way more expensive, directly or as opportunity-cost), so the saudis are going to have the monopoly on oil.

In the future the saudis won't have to actually produce this much oil, but they can just threaten to do it, they can just bluff and be a pain in the arse to anybody.

Low oil prices make it the preferred resource of energy, so also there is no stimulus in using renewable energies, improving the profitablity of those, develop infrastructure that use those over oil energies.

Basically the energy industry has peaked some months ago, and probably, we won't see it making new all time highs is some epocal thing happen - which we can't supppose or predict, and if it happens, nobody could have reasonably said so -

The market hasn't fully understood this yet, they are all guessing, there is a lot of leverage in use, you can see by the daily swings in prices in the s&amp;p, and by how high is trading the VIX.

We have to guess what the market is hoping is going to happen, and then play accordingly. 

If the vast majority hopes that oil is going to $20, but it's still trading at $30, then perhaps everyone is short and so it won't go down any lower,

 if otherwise, the vast majority  hopes that it will come back to $50 and so it's long, but it's keeps going lower, then, you need to worry because it will come down as soon as those who were long will close their position because they can't hold the pain, or has no money left, or finally understand that they can put money on something that has higher return.

so, here are my thoughts, I'd like to know what do you think about it (remember anything can happen and it's ok to be wrong, it's not ok to stay wrong), and if you like to read other un-biased, out of the box thinking, I'd  like you to follow me on Quora -&gt; https://www.quora.com/profile/Marco-Venti

Don't fight the trend, don't try to be the hero.","I get everyone wants to be fearful when others are greedy and vice versa, but this advice has saved/made me a lot of money. Hopefully it can for you too. 

As an example: You see $TWTR go down and down and down for months on months and you keep telling yourself, ""it's going to jump back up, it has to!"" All you did was fight the trend and you tried to be the hero. 

2nd example: Amazon goes up and up for years and you keep saying, ""this is way too expensive, it will fall soon!"" But it just keeps rising while your $TWTR shares fall in value. 

Don't worry too much about being late, just try to envision the current trend and ride it out for your share of the gains. 

Hope this advice helps u guys!",16
16-01-15,412pdy,Closed End Municipal Bond Funds?,"I was doing a bit of reading and come across Closed end municipal bonds (NIO, NEA, IQI). I wasn't familiar with these before. I see they average about a 6% dividend and have done so since the 90s. And the price has remained the same within maybe $4 in either direction.

Is there any reason not to purchase these? What am I missing here? I'm even tempted to throw a portion of future investment money at these to hedge against the downturns. Any thoughts here? I haven't read about these on any investment sites or forums I frequent, so I'm curious if anyone here has dabbled in these.",2

To encourage tests, the DOT also plans to make up to 2,500 self-driving cars exempt from some proposed safety rules for up to two years, and to work with state governments to create state regulations for autonomous vehicles. It suggests an interest in lowering auto fatalities is behind the effort. Foxx: ""We ask ourselves, 'What if human error could be eliminated? That is a possibility worth pursuing.

""Mobileye which is going after the autonomous driving market via its driver-assistance systems, is a potential beneficiary.

So for fun, let's take the long weekend to take a hard look at Netflix, Apple TV, and Amazon prime.

Netflix got the jump on this technology and are clear leaders in the race.  We are all aware of Netflixs valuations.  What do we think Netflix has that the competition can't copy?   Is there any margin of safety?

Amazon streaming and Apple TV are both currently small arms of giant corporations.  This would suggest they may have large pools of resources.  What kind of money are these companies willing to throw at competing with Netflix?  Does this even matter? Are these streaming platforms so small relative to their parent corporations that they are mostly negligible at this point?


What is the likelihood Netflix will lose market share to Amazon or Apple?  Is there any reason to believe they will?  At what rate?  Why or why not?

What are current growths and subscriptions of these services? 

What are revenues?  Overhead?  I'm not even sure if these numbers are readily available.

What are reasonable predictions for the future?  Based on what evidence?

Ford looking reasonable, Assumptions and Australian trading on NASDAQ.","So I finally got some money rolling in and I don't want to have sit there in my bank and I have been reading up on the stock market and my last week of study has left me to believe that Ford seems to be decent for myself.

I think that from Ford has progressed well over the last few years, not only doing well in such a hard market but also expanding into Russia. At the moment F sits at 11.9 respectively, personally I don't know how much it can rise in say by the end of this year, [some say 18.0](http://247wallst.com/investing/2016/01/14/merrill-lynch-has-4-unloved-high-dividend-stocks-with-big-upside-potential/) Others may not give a level of price but say a [near definite yes to buying](http://ir.net/news/stock-news/123152/ford-motor-company-nysef-shares-fall-despite-announcement-of-special-dividend/)

16-01-15,413gux,What I do on days when the DJIA drops 400 points,"Instead of staying glued to CNBC on days when the market seems to be in free fall or turmoil, I take the opposite approach. I turn off the TV and don't even look at any stock quotes for the day. 

I'll hunker down with a 10k and my spreadsheets and focus on continuing due diligence on investment opportunities I'm vetting, maybe call investor relations or someone who can answer questions for me, and definitely hit the gym hard. I 100% do not even check my brokerage account or babysit my positions.

I suggest everyone here tries to adopt a similar approach to bad days in the market. The markets are going to go up and they are going to go down, and no matter what you hear on the TV no one is really sure why the markets react however they do on up days, and even less so on down days. I have found the best approach to be to ignore the noise of the talking heads and focus on finding investment opportunities where you have strong downside protection, because even though its fun to get a 10x bagger, its days like today and this week when the strongest businesses earn the top percentile of downside capture. 

When you do this, you can take advantage of days like today when everyone is losing their minds and deploy capital from your war chest with much conviction on ideas that you've taken the time to thoroughly research. 

Some may take offense to this, but if you're losing sleep over your positions on days like today then that may be a sign that you are not confident with your investments and perhaps should rethink where you're putting your money. On the other hand, simply ignoring the markets for a day or two can do wonders for your sleep and psyche. 

So take a deep breath and don't sweat it too much.",52

What I've learned is it is a risk either way, and isn't the same as the lottery or slots were you either win or lose based upon luck, its all about real world events beyond robinhood, its beyond the bar graph you can bring up on Google ... You have to know when to put your money into a stock, just because ""sune"" is at its 52 week low today, doesn't necessarily mean to put your money in asap. I know I did when its $5 and look at how low it is now. 

Also, when you look at banks that were once doing bad in '09 and are doing good again like BOA, or capital one, remember that it took YEARS, not overnight, and plenty of them went bankrupt. So while oil may be the jackpot soon, i and many others may be holding onto sinking ships so to speak.

I know the idea is that in 'bad' times like this you would essentially consider the index funds to be good picks because the general idea is that the market will rebound higher than before in the next expansionary wave.

My question is really about the other stocks - I bought them when they were going cheap but they've only fallen lower. When, if ever, should I give them up as a lost cause?

As North America’s premier manufacturer of snow plows, de-icing equipment, and vehicle attachments, Douglas Dynamics possesses two formidable moats stemming from their ability to produce high-quality products more cheaply than their competitors, and then selling those products through an extensive network of dealers.  

Further, the company has significant advantages in the shareholder-oriented management team, a high free cash flow conversion rate, low capital spending requirements, and a largely variable cost structure. These considerations make Douglas Dynamics a company that can weather most any storm (pun intended). 

An unseasonably warm winter in Douglas Dynamics’s core markets has driven the stock down to $18.50---offering investors the opportunity to buy a great company at only 9X earnings,  a 13% FCF yield, and a 20% operating earnings yield! Additionally, management is dedicated to paying a significant dividend (5% current yield) under all weather conditions, without sacrificing near- or long-term liquidity.

How do I go about recovering?,"So I'm heavily (50%) invested in TQQQ right now and I'm starting to realize that I don't have the stomach that I thought I did.  I had a plan, run all the numbers, everything looked great, and I've now know that I don't have the personal and mental fortitude to execute it.

My most recent cost basis was $119/share so as of today I'm down about 32% on those shares (down ~20% overall).  It hasn't been a good week.  But enough bitching, I want to fix this and cut down to a 15-20% holding.  The way I see it I have two options:

1. Sell low, guaranteeing a loss of about $1000, or 15%

2. Wait it out, dollar cost average more into it (still 50% holdings) and bring the cost basis down so I can ""cash out"" at even money sooner.

16-01-16,41697n,Does Nokia (NOK) have a bright future?,"Mostly known for making indestructible phones, the Finnish company has become mostly an afterthought since their handsets faded into obscurity. But with a recent $17 billion dollar merger with French telecom company Alcatel-Lucent, is Nokia due for a bright future? 

Here's a few reasons why I'm liking Nokia right now. Feel free to roast me.

* Nokia believes they can increase revenue by 3.5% each year through 2019. This is because of reduced operating costs and an expanded market thanks to the merger. Alcatel's holdings and assets (primarily excessive real estate) provide a good opportunity for Nokia to grow and increase their market size.

* Despite selling the division to Microsoft, Nokia can once again manufacture smartphones in early 2016. While Nokia no longer has their own manufacturing lines, they can license it out to companies like Foxconn, who made the Nokia N1 tablet. Foxconn paid for manufacturing and marketing, while Nokia simply designed the product and collected licensing fees. While any new rendition of the Nokia smartphone line won't take over the world, it could be a steady source of income.

* No longer a handset company, Nokia is putting a significant amount of R&amp;D into 5G technologies as well as the 'Internet of Things'. As these technologies gain traction, so can Nokia.

* ~~Nokia is rumored to be shopping around its HERE Maps product. HERE is used by Windows and Amazon phones for their map services, and it's likely what powers the in-house GPS in your new car. HERE is valued at around $2 billion, and companies like Uber, Google, Facebook, or anyone in the self-driving car race could be a potential suitor.~~ 

Nokia solid HERE for $3 billion to BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Audi last Fall. The sale finalizes in Q1.",11

-There is no reason to be bullish on oil over the long term.

-Interest rates could move higher but 2016 is a year to ""wait and see"" and then react to the markets rather than make a bold call.

-The dollar's rally is probably done for now, especially in light of how consensus says the dollar is continuing to rally.

16-01-15,414suc,[RESEARCH] Slow growth? Labor markets say relax,"***SUMMARY POINTS***

-  Slow growth in Q4 has raised concerns of a recession and contributed to the sharp deterioration in market sentiment since year-end. Yet, US labor markets show no sign of weakness. The combination of robust employment growth and weak activity naturally raises the question of which signal is correct – that coming from GDP or that from labor markets?

-  Using evidence from past US business cycles, we conclude that labor markets are a leading indicator with respect to identifying turning points in the business cycle. Since 1960, a slowdown in employment growth and a stable (or rising) unemployment rate has preceded every NBER-defined recession. Employment growth drops below the average change in employment during the expansion about 15 months before the onset of the next recession. At an average of 280k per month in Q4, payroll employment remains well above the recovery average.

-  In addition, we also find evidence that labor market data provide the best real time indicator of economic activity, consistent with findings in other academic and Federal Reserve research. Some labor market variables, such as claims and hours, lead the cycle, while the unemployment rate and employment are mainly contemporaneous with activity. Employment data, to a lesser degree, also contain lagging information.

-  The behavior of labor markets – with accelerating employment growth and a declining unemployment rate – suggests that much of the pervasive gloom hanging over the US outlook is unwarranted. The evolution of labor markets, combined with a few special factors holding down Q4 growth, gives us confidence that our outlook for modest US growth remains intact and that the end of the current cycle is still some time off.

ELI5 story time about MARKET SHARE LOSS: 

It’s 1984. You and 10 other yachters are the only people to make GMO-fueled BitcoinROFLcopters. The world loves your ROFLcopters. So much, that you get together with your top 10 competitors and decide, together, to make fewer of them so that you can charge people up the fucking nose for them. Turns out people are still happy to pay. You and your competitors are happy.

Then Mexican and Norwegian companies realize they could easily make ROFLcopters for a profit nowadays thx to your price propping. Within a couple of years, they manage to kill prices, while taking 30% your customers PERMANENTLY. Now, they have ROFLcopter factories that are established and have even gotten more efficient to withstand the lowering of prices they caused. All told, your yacht club got fucked over. AW DAMN. NOTE TO SELF, DON’T LET COMPETITORS TAKE MARKET SHARE again. Fucks over your long term spaceyacht cruises to Alpha Centauri, doesn’t it? Now you can only get a California Skiff to the m00n. What the fuck are you, a steaming pile of shit? Or worse, an indexer?

-----

So here we are today, at $29 for a WTI barrel. And now my frontpage is full of fools asking if we’ve hit bottom yet. The answer is ‘fuck no’.

[Here’s how it all started](http://crudeoilpeak.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Incremental_crude_Iraq_Saudi_Libya_Iran_US_Jan2001_Oct2013.jpg). 

From 2008 to 2014, Shale cut into world MARKET SHARE. OPEC, having learned their lesson in the 80’s said “Look at this asshole new player in town taking up our MARKET SHARE. If we cut our production to prop up prices, that’ll do nothing but help those assholes and make them grow! It’s almost like every oil producer in the world is faced with a PRISONERS DILEMMA! If we all cut production together, we all win with higher prices, but we know broke-ass Russia/Iran/Venezuela, or cowboy Shale will just pump more to make up the difference, so fuck that shit. Kill them before they cut us deeper.”.
 
Every producer on earth now knows that everyone’s only option is simply to turn on the taps 100%, pump as much as possible, knowing full well prices will plummet. So what’s the best option for each individual? Pump more than the next guy.

And so it shall go. The production surplus will increase, and prices will accelerate downwards even faster than we’ve seen so far. Take a look at [Cushing Oklahoma] (https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cushing,+OK+74023/@35.9431189,-96.7619527,7666m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x87b169f80014c5c1:0xfe855f1914b195a!6m1!1e1?hl=en-US). Then pan north of town. All those tanks, and others worldwide are filling up because we’re producing. That image was taken this month. Look at all the tanks under construction. Cool eh? I designed some of them.

Do you know when it’ll stop dropping in price? I’ll tell you right fucking now: When the world produces the same amount it consumes. When’s that? Well, right now it looks like when 1Mbbl/d of production goes TITS UP. When’s that? Who the fuck cares. BUY PUTS TILL THEY DIE. But when you get a bunch of cashless medium sized companies going bankrupt at $7/bbl, that’s only half the problem: you see, we need a new production DEFICIT for prices to rise again. Oh shit. That means we need to drink up all those new stores of crude we have sitting in tanks worldwide. That means we’re gonna need another huge deficit just for things to accelerate the other way again. More bankruptcies? FUCK YES. YACHT O'CLOCK.

Jesus fuck people, it’s not rocket science. It’s BASIC-ass shit.

When you see 2m bbl/d go bankrupt, then buy producers/drillers again, but it’s gonna cap back at the $65ish range, when shale’s happy to jump back in the game.


tl;dr: Go fuck yourself.",95

Based on this chart, the 187 area was a possible pivot point. If you're long a call at this point, you need the spy to be at least at 193. I expect that IF the news is good, you will get a rebound to the 198 level, which is another potential pivot point. This will give about a 1:1 pay out.  

If you want to reduce your exposure. You can sell the 198 Call in the same month. This will reduce your cost by $0.75 to $0.8, giving you a slightly better than 1:1 pay out. 

If everything goes to shit, you can either hold it for a loss or cut your loss at half and look for re-entry.

Tell me what you think.",2
16-01-16,417crc,A few questions about binary options,"I've just heard about binary options, and I have some questions about the whole thing because I'm trying to understand how it all works, fundamentally:

* Is my terminology correct when I say, an option is basically a fixed value contract representing whether the price of an asset is going to be above or below a specific target price after the option has expired? So for example:

Current market price is $300. Option expires in 10m. Target market price is $325. If I buy this option, I choose whether I think that the price will be above $325 at 10m01s, or below $325 at 10m01s? It only evaluates the win/loss condition the moment the expiration date is hit, correct?

* How do draws work? Does the price of the asset have to be EXACTLY the price of the target at settlement time?

* Are you betting against the service provider when you buy these options? If not, are you putting the options up on a market to be listed so others come in and choose whether they wish to bet against you?

* How are the odds calculated, I presume the idea is to get as close to 50% win/loss ratio for the provider, and then take fees as profit?

* How does payment work, if you're not betting against the service provider? Because for example, if you're actually betting against other people, say you buy an option that says the price will drop from $325 in 10m, and your return is 1.9 of your purchase (the rate you were given by the service provider), where does that extra .9 come from? Does that mean when the option goes on the market, the price of your option will be .9 of what you paid to buy it? So the person on the other end will receive odds of 2.1? Correct me if my math is wrong, this is tripping me up.

As you can see, I'm probably highly confused about how this whole system functions, and what incentive businesses have for offering options to customers. From what it seems like, the providers are taking HUGE amounts of risk because they have to magically calculate odds, and if they get those odds wrong, they lose a lot of money? Maybe I'm completely off on that too. Really appreciate some guidance here, thank you.",5

I recently read about FeeX and in exploring their site, it suggested cheaper but (ostensibly) equal funds. Especially because it looks like while WFA only charges $100/year service fee, my funds also charge about 1.9% commission, which FeeX says is a lot.

As you can probably tell from my post, I know ZILCH about investing. Something I'm trying to rectify. But it's hard to tell who to believe.

&gt;I'm being provocative. Maybe not by October, but certainly by the end of the year. If the Fed raises rates there are going to be systemic bankruptcies in the energy sector and other key industries. Corporate balance sheets will invert as they eat through their cash to stay alive. That means no more stock buy-backs, no more dividends to keep investors happy. This will lead to a market panic and a crash as liquidity finally drains out of the system.

&gt;Practically speaking, if the Fed goes ahead and raises rates in September, there will be plenty of signs by October pointing to a meltdown. In all likelihood, the Fed will respond by chickening out and lowering rates again, possibly introducing another round of QE. But if they stick with the increase in rates, yes there will be a global financial meltdown.

&gt;Only way to avoid this is to keep rates low and ride this out until 2016, where we will hopefully see some economic growth. But with oil at $38 a barrel, plus the manufacturing numbers coming out of China, I just don't see that happening.

&gt;The thing is I might be wrong about the timing of these events, but the fundamentals are obvious. You know what QE + low interest does to markets, right? It leads to moral hazards. It's like if I were to approach you and your group of friends and say, ""Hey, here's a lot of money at 0% interest rate. Go ahead and invest it. Oh, and here's $1,000,000 to get you started. And if you ever lose any money in the markets - don't worry, I'll bail you out.""

&gt;Would you and your friends make money with that kind of a scheme? Absolutely. A shit ton. But think very carefully about what would happen in the long run.
Obviously if I'm wrong about all of this I will have to completely reevaluate my understanding of not just economics and finance, but life in general.

Sure his timing is off but since the fed only did what he said in December instead of September perhaps we are only now seeing it unfold.

16-01-16,41b18l,[Extremely Technical Analysis] Facebook will make a fairly surefire rise in the next 2 weeks,"Facebook (FB) is due to report their earnings on January 27th. I use the crap out of their advertising system and am a strong believer in it. For what it's worth, I believe their ad revenue has hardly begun. More and more companies are going to catch on at just how fucking much you can target your audience.

I predict that the earnings reported will be fairly substantially above what everyone's expecting. And I also predict this is 'just the beginning'.

Note: i am not a smart man but this is the first real investment ive felt very 'sure' about.

I'm pretty confident it is/will be a more secure 5-8% gain to make in the next couple weeks alone. Which would be nice.",0

16-01-16,418696,I have some questions about Shorting,"I get the basic concept but I'd like to know some more about shorting stocks. I'm wondering how it works exactly and what are the pitfalls?

I may be completely wrong here but it seems to me that in the unstable market like we are in right now - shorting might be less risky than simply buying stocks. So many great companies doing really well can be affected by the market and take big hit like we've seen recently. However lets say if you found a company on a downward trend that's outlook is not great - i'm sure it would also be affected quite negatively by difficult market conditions and its more likely to continue to fall than to spike up suddenly.

Sorry if this is a stupid question I'm kinda new to this - am I totally talking out my ass here or is there merit to my idea? Or am I missing something quite significant?

Edit: Since we are seeing [load of articles](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/12/sell-everything-ahead-of-stock-market-crash-say-rbs-economists) about a terrible market coming - rather than just sell everything - why aren't they saying Short everything?",13

16-01-17,41baxs,Value of College,"Analysis of college and fore worth of academia: Intrinsic valuation of degree and education of college
Statements have to be made for the intrinsic value of a college education, since schooling in America, which will be focused on in this writing, almost chants the importance of the option, as if the option comes with no delay of thinking, currency, and wellbeing of the student’s future. This era of thinking is moronic and biased to the fullest regard. For, continuing much light will be focused on the quantitative data of average figures and calculation of valuation of degree: (a) Arts (b) Business (c) Law (d) Social Services (e) S.T.E.M.
We must first understand that intrinsic value is close to its real and tangible value, saying this means numbers may vary not to slight from its end result of cost in education. In wordy long and intensive form, would include the education’s total and all value forth the student. It would include and we exclude relationships, intelligence to a degree, race, gender etc. The only true important concept is the invasive feeling of debt and owes towards the issuer of such college. For proper intellect of investing in a college education is set by its debt, its earning power, its leveraged debt, and finally, its intrinsic value which may sum up both in a handful. For the following calculation these numbers occur:
·         Inflation on current US on goings=0.5%

·         Debt accumulated by per capita basis

·         Par value of end of education cost set with year multiplier=$31,231

·         Interest paid only by holder of education=5.84%

·         Tax’s remaining on vary of fields so in general on averaged per value of current year of January 1,2016 through and end to January 1,2017 equals on mean figure=31.5%

·         Leveraged aid and retirement plan of 401k and other accounts=14%

·         Years equal on mean figure of pay off payment=10 to 25 years

·         Base Salary of earning power is going to be sought out on first salary discounted on all percent and added back as a multiple of years lived in career.

These numbers give intense care and net of the value of education, by Benjamin Graham’s terms this intense care of value shouldn’t go into an analysis of securities for it bares stress on the investor but it will nevertheless show its even closer safety and soundness of investment on education and college degree.  The numbers above are here to supply what I’ll call “armor” on the young student before purchasing of education and to protect their principal from the expense of continuing payment of debt.
General calculation of intrinsic value of education from only numbers and logical approach would be first to find the students field, and career pass college and take the first year earning and discounted on all percent excluding leveraged aid and debt of buyer, for example we would say the average first year earnings of business degree based on average of $56,000 discounted by added up inflation and tax on 31.5%=32% giving the value of $17,920 times average work life of 65 giving us $1,164,800, this earning figure is the rough amount or what we’ll call the ware on “amour” amount. Then we must take the cost of education and time paid off, discounted by same rates by including leveraged aid and retirement plan of 14% accumulated to 46% taking cost of tuition of $31,231 discounted by 46% gives us $14,366 and x4 rounds out $57,464. Now we take the interest rate and discounted again to its earning figure of $1,164,800 equaling to $680,243 now divide by 65 equal to par of $10,465 and compare tuitions to all earning figure. Earning figure $10,465 to the price of average $57,464 overall expense paid on x4, give us the truth on the value of earning to expense and protection (which failed) of principal. Seeing the differences of both numbers would be a term used by Benjamin Graham as the margin of safety, equaling $-46999, and the positive number if used still is less than first year and continuing year of earnings. The truth is the too much emphasis on college and field should be thought with logical approach, for the students family and his or hers wellbeing, but this differs also for people who understand capital allocation, and for that earning figure far passes any education, so with that why to pay $30-50k on any case unless factor of earnings and amortization is taken for thought?

However, it appears to me that the US and the EU are in very different situations. While the US' economy is growing, several EU member states are still (or again) struggling. In addition, the EU has severe political problems that introduce further uncertainty and likely pressure on the joint currency.

For these reasons, I don't expect the ECB to raise rate in the next 3-5 years. Much to the contrary, I expect even lower interest (more QE) in an attempt to soften the current economic and political turbulences.

So, are the calls for the ECB to raise rates more ""wishful thinking"" than reality, or am I missing something here?",1

Ablynx is a Bio-pharmaceutical company that is primarily involved in anti-body research. In case you don't know, antibodies are blood proteins that are produced in response to and counteracting a specific antigen. In cancer and other mutations, antibodies don't recognize the cancer cells as harmful, so it does they do nothing to stop it. If Ablynx has in fact created medication that can help cure cancer, I foresee Ablynx being a standard in the drug industry.

I believe Ablynx is priced at a significant discount right now. With the growing population and aging boomers, I believe Ablynx is a great buy and hold stock.

I'm going to see how far we're down and try to judge if there's momentum to buy when the broader market is up or off their lows. Back to Netflix, my reasoning is the ITG analyst note concerning domestic subscriber growth and the fact that the company is still trading at a ridiculous price-to-earnings ratio (282x profits). That might have flown before but if growth looks weak, even domestically, the market will be less likely to sustain these prices in this environment. I'm looking at 1/29 expiration with a strike of 90. The last resort hold date is Thursday after Union Pacific reports, and if they have the same sentiment as CSX re ""freight recession"" then I might get lucky with some headwind even if Netflix hits it out of the park.

Just seems like this is the big issue no one is talking about. It's all china is weak - stuff is overpriced but meanwhile we're sitting on another potential bank bailout in the future. 

Yes there has been some movement like JPMorgan bolstering its reserves by $160 million in the third quarter. Bank of America’s at-risk loans increased 15 percent from a year ago as a result of the deteriorating finances of some of its oil and gas borrowers.

But like...160M on 40+B in loans in these types of market conditions seems like they're just trying to hide the possible damage that can happen. Imagine if oil stays at these levels for years - these banks are gonna be hurting.

Not to mention what's going to happen to the values of all the mortgages they probably have in oil boom locations that are now going to sink like stones.

TLDR - SELL EVERYTHING - BUY BACK 3X the amount of shares you own now in a year or two. Buy and hold is for suckers. Buy, sell when over priced and buy back in for half price when it all crashes is the new norm. ",10

16-01-17,41cens,Topic: The Internet of Things and the Average Investor,"Dear /r/investing, 


This is my first ever post to your wonderful, useful subreddit. I have been subscribed to and read /r/investing with fairly regular frequency. I have learned much from your threads, searching various topics (companies, markets, financial vehicles, etc.). As cheesy as it sounds, I am thankful for this community. I've learned a lot about investing and have been turned onto a number of resources and such from the threads here.


My question to you is: 

How to think about the emergence of the [Internet of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things), M2M-communication, etc. as an average, everyday investor?


From my understanding of the market and its potential, there will be amazing developments related to all sorts of new technologies, infrastructures, household goods, software, sensors, and many other things I admit I only understand a fraction of it. The internet seems poised once again, to radically alter many aspects of life. The “Internet of Things” appears to be nothing short of the next evolutionary stage of the internet.


Needless to say, with these developments come new companies and new opportunities to invest. How best to approach the emergence of this massive market as a regular investor type? It all seems like an amazing opportunity to really make some good decisions investing and build a healthy retirement for my family. I’d really like to have advice on how to go forward, what to look for, etc. I’d love to hear thoughts on companies, stocks, technologies, specific mutual fund opportunities, etc.


I have a 401k and Roth IRA but am by no means an expert on the emergence of markets this massive and the potential opportunities to invest in it. I’m knowledgeable on general personal finance, investment vehicles, etc., but this appears to be like being able to invest in Microsoft when Microsoft was in a garage. I want to act smartly about it. Pensions are dead. This all seems like a huge chance for everyday investors to cement a comfortable retirement. I want information from smart people so I make good decisions. Can you help?


Some specific subquestions for consideration: 1) When will specific, related mutual funds appear? Is that even the best way to approach something like this? 2) How might an investor like myself think about buying individual companies? Is this still better something avoided all together? 3) What investment companies (Vanguard, etc...) are on point about this stuff? What investment houses should I keep an eye on?

**TL;DR?**: I want to learn about the Internet of Things and how to invest responsibly. Thoughts?",1

16-01-17,41f6km,Some YOLO advice.,"I make a little more long term YOLO's that I think most WSB'ers aren't into. I like to take little to no risk and am willing to sacrifice a little gain for that piece of mind. Most of you however are now starting to look for buying or shorting opportunities before an earnings release and make a short term bet. There is nothing wrong with that but I have to tell you that I think its a total crap shoot right now with deflation still being priced in. My overall bearishness and understanding of marco trends tells me it doesn't matter what these companies report. Even if they bounce on spectacular earnings the bounces will be short lived (last a couple weeks at most) and eventually retrace. My YOLO recommendation is to watch any stock with a PE of 50 or more. If that sucker pops up on some spectacular earnings I would then buy puts about a month or 2 out on it after the premium has come down and wait. All stocks are sure to continue their down trend so to me this sounds like easy money with little risk that can provide some quality gains as long as you buy the puts for 1-2 months out after they pop up on earnings.",23

16-01-17,41f9m9,"Hey its World_Chaos and I'm doing an AMA @ 7pm Eastern!","**[The post that made WSB and me go viral... I'm sorry about the plebs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/419ieg/new_to_rwallstreetbets_here_are_some_resources_to/)**

**How the AMA will work:**

I will start answering questions at 7pm Eastern. I will answer the top 25 questions so go ahead and leave and comment and then upvote the questions that you want answered the most. If I have extra time I will answer more questions but I feel like this method will filter out the ""What are options can you please give me free money"" type of questions. 

**About me:**

Hey its me World_Chaos. Yes it's true I'm a senior in High school and it all started because money has always been my passion since I was little. It was my passion so much that my father taught me how to swim by throwing coins at the bottom of the pool. He told me that I could keep the coins if I could dive down and get them. This fascination transferred over to middle school when we played stock market games on MarketWatch with friends and in class. From then on I just started to immerse myself into the world and finance and learn as much as I could by; watching shows like Fast Money and Mad Money, listening to podcasts, and constantly staying updated with the news. I trade everyday and when I'm at home I watch the markets on two screens. No, I am not just trading daddy's money I started off buying and selling Ipads by getting a lower price on the [gift card exchange](https://www.reddit.com/r/GCXRep/comments/2za21w/uworld_chaos_2nd_gcx_rep_profile/) for Amazon gift cards then selling the Ipads on Ebay. I took these profits and started trading leveraged ETFs like SPXS, SPXU, UWTI, DWIT on robinhood and then moved over to options on Fidelity. I had amazing success of turning my 3k profit into $15k that eventually my parents and other friends gave me access to their accounts. I've been trading options for a long time and used to post on wallstreetbets but then just kept to myself. Here are some examples of my other posts. [1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/38iogh/so_i_sold_the_all_the_puts_for_216k_sorta_weak/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/389o6s/yolo/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3iavqu/watching_shanghai_slowly_drift_below_3000_as_a/), and [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/396gfk/more_yolo_on_spy_correction/).



**Why do an AMA?**

The reason why Im doing this AMA is because I've gotten a lot of PMs recently and I've started to get sick of answering the same questions. Some funny examples of the PMs are:

*""I just got $10k from someone and I want to start trading and shit. Have any advice?""* 

*""do you think i could make enough pay off my $9,000 car loan?""*

*""I'm a junior in college. I need to make at least $1000 quickly, and gambling with options seems like the best option.""*

*""Feel free.. to tell me to fuck off - Just curious if you have a game plan or thoughts for next week?""*

**Whats my play on Tuesday?**
Honestly no idea it all depends on how the futures look and how these Iran sanctions go through and how Asia looks. So one big mess that I can't tell you till it actually happens. Thats why I'm all sold out and sitting on cash ready.

I can offer a big pile of numbers that illustrate how bad it has been, but it can be summed up with two very simple statements.
 
First, we had over 1,850 stocks hitting new 12-month lows today. That is roughly a quarter of the entire market. Second, nearly 82% of stocks in the market are trading below their 200-day simple moving averages, which tells us how broad and deep this selloff already is.
 
Technically, the major indices are still not in a ""bear market,"" which is defined as a drop of 20% or more from recent highs, but that is meaningless. The great bulk of stocks not only are in a bear market but have been in one for quite a while.
 
When we have action this bad, the question on everyone's mind is, ""When will it end?"" There is always a crowd of folks anxious to tell us everything is fine and we should just hold on to our stocks and wait for it to blow over. Others will tell us this is the start of a long, ugly downtrend and we better be prepared because it has a long way to go.
 
I have no idea who is right, but I do know the most important thing to me is to keep my accounts as close to highs as possible, and in order to do that I have to be defensive and be ready just in case things continue to deteriorate. I'm far more concerned about protecting capital than I am about trying to catch a quick turn. I know I'll have plenty of time to rack up some gains in a better market, so I'm not going to spend too much time or effort fighting with one that is in a downtrend.
 
You can bet that when we return on Tuesday there will be intense focus again on trying to catch an oversold bounce. Traders did catch one on Thursday, but it was not an easy task and many were slammed back down when they held overnight.
 
This is definitely a market that has undergone a significant change in character. We need to accept that fact and then we can start looking for ways to produce some gains. Capital preservation comes first and that means being cautious in a downtrend.",0

16-01-18,41isj9,Questions on caps gains for investment property in US,"Maybe someone else has run into something similar. I plan to hire an accountant in the US, but I'll start researching ahead of that. 

I plan to make an offer on a house owned by my parents' friends. They're 75 years old and inherited a property 40 years ago. The family has owned it for more than 60 years. They never go there anymore.

This is a lake-front home adjacent to several properties my family owns. The current owners are considering a sale, but irrationally fearful of attracting a tax liability. They are now in their late 70s and they inherited the home from the wife’s parents. It was originally purchased in the mid-1950s for less than 10k. It was never homesteaded and I can’t find evidence of a mortgage on the property. It’s held in a trust now. The couple most likely earned less than 40k last year.

Undocumentable improvements to the property probably come to 20-30k at most, when they rebuilt the structure 30 years ago. Now, the property is valued at around 160k.

Any idea how you calculate taxes on something like this? I plan to help them pay the taxes to facilitate the sale. How much would I budget?

16-01-17,41g0ce,Special dividend question.,"""If the dividend is 25% or more of the stock value, special rules apply to the determination of the ex-dividend date.  In these cases, the ex-dividend date will be deferred until one business day after the dividend is paid.  In the above example, the ex-dividend date for a stock that’s paying a dividend equal to 25% or more of its value, is September 11, 2013.

Sometimes a company pays a dividend in the form of stock rather than cash. The stock dividend may be additional shares in the company or in a subsidiary being spun off. The procedures for stock dividends may be different from cash dividends. The ex-dividend date is set the first business day after the stock dividend is paid (and is also after the record date).

If you sell your stock before the ex-dividend date, you also are selling away your right to the stock dividend. Your sale includes an obligation to deliver any shares acquired as a result of the dividend to the buyer of your shares, since the seller will receive an I.O.U. or ""due bill"" from his or her broker for the additional shares. Thus, it is important to remember that the day you can sell your shares without being obligated to deliver the additional shares is not the first business day after the record date, but usually is the first business day after the stock dividend is paid.""

So with COOL it's ex-pay was 1-15, does this mean that one would've had to wait until 1-19 to not sell with a due bill? If that's the case, why in the hell was the sell off on 15? Can shares be bought after hours morning of the 19th and sold at open since they should still have the due bill?",2

Everything reverts to the mean eventually now and that's all we're seeing here. The market works in waves and we're on the way down. 

http://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe/

23.8 even after the recent tank against a mean of 16. Yes, yes, yes, new normal, easy money from the fed, low bond yields means higher PE ratios now. Sure, go ahead and believe that if you want but look at where this ratio was right before 2008 and right before all the major downturns in the stock market - 25+ is a risk and we were there just a few weeks ago. The market over-reacts to these types of moves and it will happen again here. 

Same with price to sales. 

http://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-sales

Investors are paying far too much for each $$ in earnings or each $$ in shares especially against the economic back drop.

Sure, things seem rosy in the US right now but the hundreds of thousands of layoffs that already happened in the oil industry and the massive slow downs in china and the rest of the world will hit us hard soon. 

Add the risk of the ridiculous amount of easy money loans that propelled the stock market to these ridiculous valuations and the impact the heavy defaults will have on the financial world.

Or you know go ahead and pay 25 P/E for Mcdonalds because it's ""ON SALE"" after the recent drop - despite the fact that you could have gotten it for a 17 P/E a year or two ago before this entire mania took over.

16-01-18,41jl5b,Can I buy long range oil futures to hedge personal consumption?,"My father, brother and I are recreational private pilots. If oil goes back up to $100/bbl it would cost us many more thousands of dollars a year. I believe that this is a likely scenario in a few years once the supply/demand imbalance is worked out of the system.

The [CME Globex options chain for light sweet crude](http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/crude-oil/light-sweet-crude.html) shows that barrels are trading as far out as Dec 2024 for &lt;$50. Again, we don't believe that these low prices are sustainable.

We're relatively small investors but if we put, say, $10k-$20k total for all three of us into futures at these prices we'd be OK walking away at a loss if oil prices stayed low for an extended period. This would be a highly speculative play and not a major part of our portfolios.

Ever since I heard about Robin Hood I have been patiently waiting for them to expand to the UK but it seems like I may not have to as I have just found idealing.com

From the looks of things, it looks exactly like a Robin Hood equivalent but is there something i'm missing? I was hoping just to throw a small amount in there and test it out. Stock picking is something that i've always had an urge to do.

I'm guessing I would just setup as standard account on 'Tariff 1 - Smart Wealth' as stated on [this page](https://www.idealing.com/en/help/services_and_prices). Is there anything on this page or anywhere else on the website that is ringing any alarms bells with anyone?

16-01-18,41jr8e,Any way to take advantage of low oil prices if funds are CDN$ ?,"I have concerns that there is no way to invest in oil with Canadian funds and be rewarded when the price of oil goes back up. Can you provide comment?  
I understand that the Canadian dollar is pegged to the price of oil, and moves with it. So if I purchase oil priced in CDN$, the value of that oil interest will stay the same as both oil and the CDN$ appreciate.  
Likewise, if I convert to US$ and purchase oil interests in US$, the Canadian dollar will increase against the US$ with the increases in the price per barrel, erasing any gains I've made.  
The only way to benefit is to convert to US$, and earn a return off the marginal surplus between the US$ price per barrel increase, and the CDN$ increase.

So we've all yolo'd on microcap pharma stocks here, but it's time for us to hit the large cap. I purchased 300 shares of Abbvie Pharmaceuticals about two and a half weeks back. I believe this stock has good room to run - recently, a new leukemia drug in their development was being given the fast-track for FDA approval, with a positive sentiment for it in the market - it was one of the few big gainers last friday (opening at ~54.50 and closing at ~57.35). Abbvie also has the strongest Immunology drug in the business, Humira - and recently, their competitor Amgen was denied a patent claim on Humira bolstering the exclusivity of a core Abbvie drug. I think there is money to be made in the short term still, with a price target of ~63-64, and it also pays a good dividend. Check it out, and hopefully my DD was helpful; any critiques would be great.  ",3

16-01-18,41jzwb,How I won and lost a quarter million dollars,"It was 2008 and people were talking about Soviet-style collapse. We'd have food lineups, riots, capital controls designed to keep us from being able to access the last of our money before the government could inflate it away into nothing. Stock up on gold and ammunition and fill your pantry with cans of tuna because our entire way of life was about to fall apart. 

In 2008 it was really possible to believe all of that, but I was an optimist.

I was working for Teck, which had made an ambitious top-of-the-market purchase of five met coal mines. For those that don't know, met coal isn't burned to make power, it's a chemical reactant used to make iron. Prices were high and climbing, so we were making money hand over fist. After half a decade of good times, many in the industry thought we had entered a new world order in which mining, long a pathetic little corner of the stock market that turned hope and money into disappointment and losses, would finally enter the limelight. The teeming masses of poor Chinese were poised to rapidly ascend to western levels of wealth and prosperity, and they'd be taking as much steel and copper as we could give them.

As someone in the industry, I can say that mining has a bit of a complex: high ego and low self esteem. We provide the materials from which the world is built; in return, half the world doesn't know we exist and the other half wants to ban us to protect endangered tree frogs or something. But now, all you city-slickers would look upon us with reverence: mining would take its rightful place in the sun, and anyone lucky enough to have gotten in on the ground floor would be fabulously wealthy, justly rewarded for being part of such a noble industry.

I was 25 years old and bought it completely.

So when everything started collapsing in 2008, I didn't sell. Armed with lots of disposable income, no children, no debt, and a low cost of living, I started buying Teck shares. ""I'm still working here and the lights are still on, the price of met coal isn't too bad... fuck it, let's see what happens."" I bought at $30, $20, $10, even $5. Sure, the company had just made one of the largest debt-financed acquisitions the industry had ever seen, but it would all be OK. 

And it was. The share price bottomed out at about $4 and then rose to $60. I had made one ridiculously lucky bet. 

Ever look at a graph and think how fabulously wealthy you could be if you'd bought, well, anything in late 2008 and sold it a year later? That could have been me.

But I was to be a victim of my own success. ""Holy fuck, I'm great at this. A quarter million dollars may be cool, but what if I can do this again? I could have a million dollars in cash before I'm 30!""

Most of what I sold, I reinvested in other mining companies. Small shitty ones with some drill core and a prayer. I actually invested in my boss's startup venture (*facepalm*). I invested in gold miners. When share prices started dropping, I thought ""DEAL OF THE CENTURY OMG!"" and bought more. MINING IS THE FUTURE! I tried to catch falling knives. I doubled-down on failing investments. I based my decisions on graphs and hope, not balance sheets and income statements. I refused to sell because of pride and ego and an unwillingness to turn a paper loss into a real one.

Now the mining industry is back in the gutter where it belongs and I have next to nothing. Teck shares are back at $4. This time I'm not buying any, but there's still a burning thought in the back of my mind: what if I'm missing out on the deal of a lifetime? What if I take just a little more of the money that I worked my ass off to earn and 'invest' it? This isn't a healthy mentality; it's more like those desperate and pathetic creatures you see humping slot machines and blackjack tables, hoping to turn it all around.

I've done some soul searching and realized just how much of my self-worth I had tied up in this. The rest of you were suckers, following the herd like sheep, and by merely having the resolve to run in the opposite direction I got rich. All of my other failures in life - and they were numerous - didn't matter.

tl;dr - Won big at yuppie gambling, thought I was really clever. Easy come, easy go.

16-01-19,41n0df,(Serious) ELI5: How would a Japanese situation Bogglehead invest (eg. ETF’s from 1989 onward),"Past results are not an indicator of future performance.  

So I am going to expose my ignorance here.  I am a conservative investor that generally follows a Couch Potato / Boggle Head approach after 10 years and 2 crashes (1998-2009) proved clearly to myself that 1) I can’t pick stocks worth a damn, and 2) the 3 different investment advisers I subsequently tried could do no better than the index but for much higher costs.  So from 2010 onwards I am in mostly broad market mutual funds that have now transitioned to ETF’s (USA/CDN/WORLD/BONDS) with a slowly growing bond percentage (I plan to live to 90+ so 100-age does not cut it).  I try to have little churn in my taxable accounts so I pick low MER ETF’s and re-balance by changing my purchasing due to getting taxed at 50+% on any capital gains I make.  As an aside: I really understand how people can get stuck overweighed in stocks like Nortel as the minute you sell you loose 50+% of your gains so you want to rebalance but you don’t because you immediately lose 50%.

But a buy/hold ETF strategy depends on the market always climbing - right?  If you were a buy/hold Japanese investor who had significant money in the market as of Dec 1, 1989 you would still be down 35 years later.  Right?

Dividend chasing would at least have gotten some money out.  Real-estate can boom/bust as well but if you are cash-flow positive you have a solid paid for asset after 15-20 years + continued rental income.  The stock market is just paper and as Japan has shown can blow away or be stagnant for years.  But then again buying property in Detroit 30 years ago did not turn out great either.

Yes, I don’t see USA growth going down anytime soon.  But my retirement (when I actually want to quit which will be well after when I can afford to quit), is 30+ years out.  I can’t see into the future but who knows.  If we get 1-3 feet sea level rise and the eastern/southern USA gets hammered every high tide/hurricane how will their economy be? 

I have no answers.  Diversify broadly I guess?  That's why I have 30% World.  I’m just looking at my paper statements as I am preparing for my 3rd rollercoaster (1999,2008,now) and thinking that I have 100’s of thousands of dollars invested but with no tangible assets to show for it. 

I’m not expecting anyone to have any easy solutions.  Just wondering what you think.

If they come in at .02 EPs this will be down from .10 eps from last year.

With the current market conditions.  I think the market will post 5%-10% drop in after hours, if nflx posts anything below .08 cents a share.  Though, if the nflx earns anything above .08 cents a share. After hours trading will be a gain of 5%-8%.  Then, the next opening day NFLX will lose all of the previous days after hour gains.

I would set up trades before after hours and on the opening of weds morning on the downside.

Only way nflxs downtrend could possibly reverse, if they come out with a huge blowout of .20 per share.

I have some money that I want to invest (around 100k) and there are 3 options, I talked to some guy at the bank who wanted to invest it for me in a vehicle that makes a consistent 15% return and is low risk according to him, but I don't really believe it, imo there's no way that thing is low risk.

The second options would be going long on oil and hedging it with refineries. 

The 3rd thing is what my dad said I should do and would be investing it into relatively safe companies that pay a nice dividend and are currently cheap to buy, for example Nestle, ZURN etc. 

I could comfortably leave the investment alone for 5+ years.

I'm trying to follow the general Bogleheads philosophy (investing domestically and internationally in ETFs and bonds) however I've encountered several dilemmas.

From my research, most Singaporean ETFs have terrible expense ratios (0.35% - 0.49%!) and aren't particularly diversified due to the small market (36 companies is not much diversity). Our only government bond also has a rather mediocre rate of return (2-3%) which barely beats inflation in the long run.

On top of that, I'm planning to enter a field of work that may involve me travelling around the world (agricultural sciences). So I have no attachment to investing or living here.

So instead of investing part of my portfolio locally, would it be wise to invest it in the US instead, as it's a more diverse market? This is my proposed portfolio:

75% ETF

70% US (CSPX LN, TER = 0.07%)

30% International (SWDA LN, TER = 0.20%)

25% Bonds

100% International Government Bonds (IGLO, TER = 0.20%)

Option #1: 5 YR at 4.65% Fixed with the option for .50% reduction with auto pay. 

Option #2: 5 YR at 3.70% Variable with the option for .50% reduction with auto pay. These are the stipulations for their variable rates.

The Variable Interest Rate is based upon the Prime rate plus a margin of 1.700% based on your selected repayment term, credit profile and the credit profile of your cosigner, if applicable.

 The rate will not increase more than once a month but there is no limit on the amount that the rate could increase at one time. Your rate will never exceed 18%.

 If the Interest Rate increases, your monthly payments will be higher.


Our collective average interest rate based on weight was ~6% so either option is a reduction as far as interest goes. Additionally, keep in mind I built an amortization table and we have the money in our budget to pay the loan off in 30 months rather than 60, (that's being conservative) which is what we will do regardless of the structure of the loan.

16-01-18,41kn36,My Idea for a play on oil,"I have been thinking a lot recently about our situation with US oil. There is clearly money to be made in this sector, and I wanted to run my thoughts past you guys to see what you all think.

Currently, oil prices are riding low. Let’s analyze what this will do on a macroeconomic scale.

**Low Oil Prices:** 

* Discourage companies from searching for alternative energy sources. If oil is cheap, why not use oil. 

* Decrease cost of ALL businesses, which in turn encourages growth. 

* Hurts alternative energy businesses. If oil is cheap and accessible, why use alternative energy solutions?


Oil is nonrenewable, and at some point overproduction must stop. When supply goes down and demand does not change, a price increase is inevitable.

**After Oil Prices Rise:**

* The stock market will take a beating due to the now higher cost to run a business. 

* Lack of bonus income due to low oil prices will decrease the ability for businesses to expand. 

* Alternative energy will again become more useful. 

* Oil companies that survive will be valued higher than they are right now.


**What To Do About The Current Situation**

At this time, United States oil might not be at its ultimate low, however one can rarely invest at the all time low. It is key to buy when people are scared to buy and not during euphoria. The US oil sector is hurting bad and the US stock market is riding high. Knowing this, what can we do to make some money. By buying US oil companies, we take the risk of bankruptcy. In order to mitigate this, we should only buy into companies that we believe can take another lick and keep on ticking. I look towards Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Company (CBI). CB&amp;I designs, engineers and constructs some of the world's largest energy infrastructure projects mainly for oil and gas companies, but also for nuclear and other forms of alternative energy. CB&amp;I is hurting because currently energy companies do not have the required funds or income in order to expand and require new facilities. CB&amp;I is losing money, but is not losing money at the same rate of those who are directly reliant on the price of oil. This gives them an advantage over a typical US energy company.

**My Thoughts on the Future of CB&amp;I**

Once the downturn of oil reverses, oil companies should start to see their stock values climb once again. The same is not exactly true for CB&amp;I. They do not recover until energy companies begin to require more infrastructure once again. This may take up to a few years after the recovery of oil. If we are certain that CB&amp;I can make the wait, then there is no reason that CB&amp;I would be a bad long term investment.

16-01-18,41knq2,"Bounce back with leverage, somewhere between investing and YOLO","Alright, dicks, here's the deal: leveraged ETFs have some cool mathematical properties that are very misunderstood but that could be valuable in some contexts.  You all know and love the leveraged ETFs as those fun day-trading tools that let you lose money even faster than usual, but I have a different purpose in mind. 

I put together a ""crash-recovery"" plan using using these funds late last year.  I certainly wasn't expecting to put it into practice quite so soon, but things are getting weird, so it's time to start.  The idea is to take advantage of optimal daily leverage on equities and get a nice bounce back during a market recovery following a decline of varying magnitudes.  This isn't a short-term play, but is obviously much more risky than buying and holding an index or mutual fund.  


#Leveraged ETFS 

Most experts recommend against holding these funds for anything but the shortest of time horizons for three main reasons, so here's a background if you aren't familiar with these:  
1) Divergence from the underlying  
2) Leverage decay  
3) Expenses  

###### 1. Divergence from underlying (due to time and tracking error)
Remember that these ETFs are based on the daily price change of their underlying.  So, SPXL, for instance, tracks three times the daily performance of the S&amp;P - the keyword there being daily.  That is, if the S&amp;P drops 3% in a day, SPXL will be down about 9%.  But if the S&amp;P drops 3% in a week, it is less likely that SPXL will be down exactly 9% - it could be down 3% itself or it could be down 15%.  Over longer time frames, they diverge even more.  Therefore, the argument is that you shouldn't use these funds because they aren't guaranteed to track the underlying over a long time frame.  This is actually good (we'll see why later). 

ETA: I should also add that there is also a ""tracking error"", which is simply due to imperfect science of precisely matching the 2x or 3x return of the underlying.  These funds achieved their stated leverage by using complex derivatives, swaps, etc, but they  rarely hit the target exactly, and may be under or over on a given day, contributing to divergence from the underlying.  That is, a 3X fund might actually be down 3.4% on a day when the underlying was down 1%.  In fairness to these funds, many ETFs have these issues, but they could be larger in these funds due to their complexity. 

###### 2. Leverage decay
The argument of leverage decay is this:  Take a 3x leveraged fund that has a base price of $100 and an underlying that conveniently has the current price of $100 as well.  Simulate a random walk where every day the price has an even chance of going up or down.  If the underlying goes up $10 (10%) on day 1, then the leveraged fund is up 30%, for a new price of $130.  The next day, the underlying drops $10 and goes back to it's starting price of $100.  This is a daily decline of 9%.  The leveraged ETF now drops 27%, because it moves 3x the percent change of the underlying.  But because 27% of 130 is greater than 30% of 100, the leveraged ETF now only has a price of $94.9 - a 5% loss from the starting value. Meanwhile the holders of the underlying have the same value they had when they started.  Clearly leveraged ETFs suck, right? 

(edit: cleaned up the math/percents based on u/supirate comment below!)

Not so fast.  Let me stop here to crack an egg of knowledge on your face: *markets don't, in the long run, have an even chance of going up or down - they trend upward*.  So any analysis based on even odds of up or down movement ignores underlying trends in equities as economies and markets rise and progress over time. 

Note that this does *not* apply to commodities, which are, in fact, a crap shoot.  In other words: you have to look at, say, SPXL very differently from how you'd look at UWTI or DWTI.  Moreover, it does NOT apply to the bearish funds.  If markets inexorably rise over time, then the bear funds must, over time, go to zero.  We see this reflected in the share price, as the bear funds reverse split all the time to preserve their share value.  But for leveraged funds based on broad equities (e.g. SSO, SPXL, FAS) this should not be the case and they should go up over time. 

###### 3. Expenses
Yeah, these things have high expenses, no getting around that.  But if expenses &lt; gains, you're coming out ahead, so who cares. 

# Leveraged Returns

In another thread, I was talking about this very topic since there is so much confusion on these things and  u/Evebitda shared this article that explores, better than I can, the nonsense of leverage decay, and actually shows the optimal ""daily leverage"" for a variety of indices.  http://ddnum.com/articles/leveragedETFs.php

It turns out that the S&amp;P has an optimal daily leverage of ~3: http://ddnum.com/images/GSPCsmallchart1.png

So how did 3x leveraged funds perform in the last ~5 years or so?  Take a look at how FAS and SPXL did compared to the S&amp;P overall:  https://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=maximized&amp;chdeh=0&amp;chfdeh=0&amp;chdet=1453144897373&amp;chddm=358156&amp;chls=IntervalBasedLine&amp;cmpto=NYSEARCA:SPY;NYSEARCA:FAS&amp;cmptdms=0;0&amp;q=NYSEARCA:SPXL&amp;ntsp=0&amp;ei=MTudVvjOLIbKmAG_6oSwBw

Clearly these things do pretty well (if you consider beating the market by 5x doing well).  And they should over a long period of time, because markets trend upward.   

# My Plan 

So here's what I'm doing:

When the market drops ~10% (like it just did) I'm buying 100 shares of a 3x equity ETF  
If the market drops another 10%, I'm buying 200 shares  
If the market drops another 10% I'm buying 300 shares  

Let's say you do this with FAS, which has returned a very nice 200% since late 2008. Note that includes the drop in Q1 of 2009 AND the recent decline, and still returns more than double the SPY in the same time frame.  Remember that a 10% market drop will lead to *roughly* a 30% drop in FAS, but it depends on how the sequence of down up/days stacks up.  

A 10% market drop brought FAS from roughly $30 to 21.  Another 10% market drop would bring FAS to ~$15, and a further 10% would bring it to ~$10.  
  
100 shares @ $21 = $2100  
200 shares @ $15 = $3000  
300 shares @ $10 = $3000  

This would give you 600 shares for ~8 grand, and an average price of $13.3.  When things get back on track - whether it's this week, or late this year, or in a few years - you're well-positioned to capture those gains with some extra leverage.   

### Edit:RE strategy
Just to be clear, I chose this strategy and buy-ins just because they fit with the money I was willing to risk on this, not for any mathematical reason.  You could probably do very well by just buying some shares of FAS or SSO or something, and then keeping some cash on the side, writing cash-secured puts ~25-30% OTM on a regular basis.  That's actually the strategy I'll be pursuing and have started implementing.  I have a couple hundred shares of FAS and a couple hundred of SSO, and I'm writing options around them to catch the down swings. 

I like FAS over SPXL becuase the share price is lower (I can take more positions in optionable 100-lots with less cash), it has actually done better over the years, and has more liquid options.  I will likely write some OTM cash secured puts on FAS next week to lower my basis on the position. If the market recovers from here, then I've got 100 shares of FAS plus whatever premiums I collect.  If it drops to the next entry point, then I've got those shares at a discount. 

# Risks
There are numerous potential risks to this strategy:  
  
###### Fund availability
The SEC could fuck with these funds (they are already considering it) and that could seriously disrupt them or even make them worthless.  Direxion/powershares/etc could stop offering the funds or go bankrupt or be terrorist attacked by mutants.   Point is: they might be worth 0 dollars due to circumstances completely outside of market forces. 

###### Unlucky math (ie: leverage decay works against gainz)
The next recovery might not have a beneficial sequence or magnitude of up/down days like previous one - it might have more sequential down days with just a few big up days.  If this happens, these funds will SEVERELY lag the regular markets.  
  
###### Horrible bear market
The market might never recover.  If Zerohedge is right, we're all going to be eating our own feces in bunkers any day now and if that happens, this strategy won't help you.  What you should do instead is put all your money into gold, ammo, SPY puts, and food that isn't feces.  
  
###### I'm an idiot
I could be completely fucking wrong about this.  I'm just some dude on the internet. Don't listen to me.  Seriously.  I could be wrong, I could be lying, I could be working for a company that sells leveraged ETFs and who wants your money.  You don't know.  So don't take this as advice, because it's not.  

# Conclusion 
TL;DR: my plan is to buy 3x leveraged equity ETFs every time the broad markets drop ~10% and add more every further drop.  I started doing this with 100 shares of FAS last week, as the markets were down roughly 10% and will buy twice as much FAS if there is another big drop.  I'll be using 5-10% of my long-term portfolio for this, depending on how far it slides and how much I end up buying. 

If you misinterpret this as advice and make trades based on what some random dong (me) on the internet says, you're a fucking idiot and you deserve to lose all of your money and have your family eaten by cannibals. Especially if you are new to this sub from r/all.  Disclosure: I am long FAS and short volatility. 

Hugs, kisses, and go fuck yourselves. 

EDIT: Since people insisted on shitting on this idea without actually reading the god damn post, I went back and looked at daily S&amp;P data for the last couple of decades from the CBOE.  I mapped out the daily percentage change at 1x leverage (ie: actual price change) and then 2x and 3x daily leverage as well.  

On January 1, 1986, let's say you put $10,000 into the SPY, $10,000 into a 2x daily leveraged fund, and $10,000 into a 3x leveraged fund, how much would you have today?

SPY (1x daily leverage): $100,378.83   
2x SPY (2x daily):  $358,616.51   
3x SPY (3x daily): $423,856.34      

Note that this includes the crash of 1987, 2001, 2009, 2011, AND the current turmoil, including august. 

So, yeah, I'm gonna stick a few grand (a small percent of my portfolio) into a leveraged daily fund for the long term.  Here is the spreadsheet if you want to see the numbers: http://www.filedropper.com/dailypricehistory

I'll keep playing with the numbers to see if the ""buy the dips"" strategy is even more effective, but I think it will be. 

Edit #9,000: So I've played with the historical data a bit, and the best I've come up with so far is that 2x leverage should have a bigger place in the portfolio than 3x, and the gains from the higher leverage should flow down to cash when they come in.  So I'm going to buy more SSO than FAS and keep some cash on hand to write OTM puts on FAS and SSO and buy into big dips while collecting a nice premium.  If the FAS or SSO position gets too big (a good problem to have!), I'll move some of the gains into cash to re-balance and look for my next entry. 

If you don't want all that complexity, then the aforementioned plan of just taking small positions after substantial market declines with a leveraged fund (SPXL, FAS, SSO, etc) should be a nice middle ground between YOLO and investing.

Maybe you do, but apparently the /r/all autists don't. All you did was repeatedly by puts, and it just so happened timing was on your side this time. Did you call a Chinese market crash? Did you call an oil plummet? No, all you did was repeatedly place put bets on the market, even when IV was soaring. Yeah, I've seen your explanations. ""Durr hurr, I saw the support levels were broken."" Bullshit! Indicators like that in the situation the market was in can mean it will move either way you delusional piece of shit! A single short squeeze and you would've been permanently fucked.

16-01-19,41nuqt,"DEUTSCHE BANK: We expect the stock market to go 'up and soon'","""We expect the next 5%+ S&amp;P price move to be up and soon.""

That's the gutsy call Deutsche Bank's chief US equity strategist, David Bianco, made in a note to clients on Monday. It follows what's been the worst-ever start to the year for the stock market, which has seen the S&amp;P 500 plunge 8% in just two weeks.

""We are not panicked by this correction because we understand it,"" he said. ""It's driven by a profit recession centered at certain industries caused by factors that we've long flagged as risks with detailed research and quantified sensitivities.""

Bianco's no stranger to making contrarian buy calls when stock prices are tumbling. As the market was correcting during fall 2011, he cranked up his target for stocks and told clients to buy, drawing all sorts of nasty criticism. His call was later proved right.

In recent years, he's been one of the most cautious strategists on Wall Street. He's been vocal about the problems with corporate profits. And he's been outright bearish about the market's near-term expectations for energy-sector profits. With his note on Monday, he joins his peers who have been slashing their outlooks for earnings.

""We now assume zero profits from Energy in 2016 and an oil price of ~$35/bbl,"" Bianco said on Monday. ""It might be better or worse, but zero is not normal and eventually Energy will likely contribute $5-10 to S&amp;P EPS. Thus, 'normal 2016 S&amp;P EPS' is $125 or more and on that basis the index is at a 15.0 PE or less.""

Bianco now forecasts the S&amp;P 500 will hit 2,200 this year on $120 earnings per share (EPS). This is down from his initial targets of 2,250 and $125.

Going back to his call for a rebound, one key assumption is that the whole economy doesn't go into recession.

""All GDP recessions coincide with profit declines, but not all profit declines coincide with GDP recessions and that's what makes it a profit recession as distinct from a broad recession,"" he said.

And when there's no broad recession, the dip in stock prices reverses quickly. Here's Bianco on the history of stock market dips:

Dips of 5%+ are common and happen at least once a year. Only three years since 1960 didn't have a 5%+ dip (1964, 1993 &amp; 1995) and many mid-cycle years saw more than one 5%+ dip during the year (late 1980s and late 1990s). Most 5%+ dips usually stay under 10% and are quick. Of the 80 5%+ sell-offs since 1957, about 2/3rd were less than 10% with an average sell-off of 7% and duration of 27 trading days.

There were several multi-year periods without a 10%+ correction: Oct 57 – Jan 60, Jul 62 – Jan 66, Aug 84 – Jul 87, Nov 90 – Sep 97, and most recently Apr 03 – Sep 07 ...

""Gotta swing when you see it,"" Bianco said.

The S&amp;P 500 was at 1,880 when he published this call. A 5% gain would take the index to 1,974.",28

Except for FB, Ive been watching all these. I dont know much about FB's acquisitions. Oculus VR, Instagram, WhatsApp, and the 50 some others over the past years... I know of them, but Im not much other than topical information. I dont like FB as an investment because I think it will dwindle in use a la MySpace, though I dont have anything to substantiate that.  

I like Amazon and Netflix because I use both frequently and want them to succeed. They both have big plans for expansion and seem like good investments at currently low prices. 

It seems like Apple is losing its share of the phone market and I personally feel like its products are overvalued, but many other people would likely disagree with that. (As I type this on my iPhone.)

Then the ubiquitous Google, the company so well known, their name has become a verb. They have so many projects and are involved in so many tech facets that they will almost certainly be around for a long time. 

I know Ive stated a lot of preferential bias for and against, which is probably not the ideal mindset for an investor. So, those of you with more knowledge, tell me what you think about these companies. Or another way to phrase the question, if you had X dollars to invest in these 5, what percent would you allocate to each (0 is of course acceptable)?

Kinda in a pickle here and not sure what to do. 

I have 2 portfolios in Wealthfront at the moment. 
A Roth IRA with about $9k (down from $10.5k) and a personal account with about $4k (down from $5k). I have lost 11.3% and 13.5% respectively. 

I'm really torn here. I like the idea of Wealthfront and the web / mobile apps, but ever since I joined in April 2015, I have lost substantial amounts of money.  

I built my Roth up from $8.5k to $10.5k in about a year and half using Vanguard ETFs and 20 / 50 / 100 SMAs. This worked great and I made money and really want to return to my own strategy.  Part of me wants to cut and run, but I will most likely ride it out. Last year was flat, 2016 Q1 has been abysmal.. Wish I wasn't locked into this service. Any thoughts would be a huge help.

16-01-18,41kynm,Learning about stock trading and would like to get into the industry. Need advice.,"Hello /r/stocks

I'm not sure how to start this. I guess a quick story to give you my reasons of considering stock trading. I'm a 20 year old Eastern European who recently moved to London. Life's been shit and broken dreams made me fall apart as a person in the past few months, but I recollected myself and started thinking about an alternative, which led me to stock trading. I realize it's gonna be a long journey, there's a lot to learn, and I need to dedicate a lot of time and effort to it, but I've done it once when I started studying English and I feel like it's time to do it again.

I'm as green as it gets in this sort of thing. When I open up a trading program I am completely lost. I have no idea what the numbers mean, I have no idea what the candles and diagrams represent and pretty much the only thing I know is that - green is good, red is bad. 

I'm currently getting my job situation sorted out and while I'll be saving up money, I'll have free time on my days off and would like to study stock trading every chance I get, however, when I look for info online, it seems like it's full of scammers who advertise their wealth, promising people magic techniques that will make them millions. Sounds good, but also smells really fishy. Especially when they tell you to buy their DVD. I mean, come on, dude, who even uses DVDs anymore? 

So basically, to sum this whole thing up, I need a little bit of guidance. The things I would like to know are:

Where does a person like me start learning? Are there any step-by-steps out there? Maybe I need to start learning about something that does not directly tie into stock trading?

What are the brokers I should be looking at? I'm still not sure how stock trading works, being in the UK, can I even trade on US sites?

Why are penny stocks looked down upon? I know it's high risk, but seems like people are making serious money there.

Do I really need a lot of money to get started in this industry? A lot of money to me is 5-10k GBP.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Thank you.

Edit2: Thank you for the bros who pointed out my mistake - apparently the rule came into effect on 9th of Jan, not the 8th. Some even said 15 TRADING DAYS so that would put the potential sell off date on either the 25th of January or the 1st of February (if counted by trading days). My watch out below warning remains, I am not so certain about the exact date anymore.",86

16-01-19,41p56f,"I'm trying to learn options by using Investopedia's simulator","I'm new to options, and this sub has inspired me to learn more about options trading. Someone on here recommended the Investopedia simulator to learn options, so I took the advice. After reading lots of info on here, watching many YouTube videos, and reading a bunch of articles I decided to start investing my fake money. I don't really know what I'm doing so I'm going to put on here what I've bought and ask a couple questions.

&amp;nbsp;

So I bought 3 different put options for SPY, since that seems to be the popular thing on this sub, 10 each, at strike prices of $180, $182.50, and $185. I guess my idea is to see how much each increases, because i don't understand exactly what increases the value, other than if SPY price decreases, your put value increases. 

&amp;nbsp;

At current time SPY is trading at $188.53. and my put options have all slightly increased in value. 

&amp;nbsp;

So my qeustions are:

Does the price of the stock HAVE to go below the strike price ($180, $182.5, and $185) before you can sell it? or can you sell the put options as the value of the options increases? 


What's the smarter way to do it?


Is the value of the put options increasing because the stock price is getting closer to strike price?

&amp;nbsp;

I also bought a couple of AAPL calls because, fuck it, its fake money so, YOLO. And I'm guessing AAPL won't drop much further, and will then rise. Strike prices of $99 and $100

&amp;nbsp;

Question:

Why is the value going down on these as the price of AAPL has increased slightly since open today? Wouldn't my call's increase slightly in value as well?

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks for all the info you guys post, and sorry if I'm being a pleb, but ya gotta start somewhere. I'll try to decipher through all the inevitable ""FUCK YOU FAGIT, YOLO!""'s but i'll appreciate those comments too!

EDIT: Also, expiration dates. on this investopedia simulator, the only ""expiration"" date i can find is ""January"" am i missing the actual date somewhere? Can anyone that's used investopedia's simulator tell me where to find this? I don't see anything on there about weekly calls or short or long calls, just ""January""",0

16-01-19,41p8ap,Wanting to start investing with Roth IRA and normal trading. (21 yr old),"Yesterday I signed up for a Roth IRA account with Fidelity. I deposited only $50 thinking I could start with that and I learned I wasn't anywhere near the minimum to start and I wanted to start something right there and then (Only $50 so if I lost it, it wasn't a big deal). So I purchased 3 shares of HPE (hoping to catch it low and hope they come through with this huge risk they are taking). I guess my goal here is that I have 2 accounts, one for specific investments that I can trade daily/weekly/monthly and a Roth IRA retirement where I buy into a Mutual Fund and forget about it. I would like to somewhat stay active with the market and stuff for fun. Hence why I would like a 'normal' trading account. I will do monthly investments into both accounts for a minimum $50 a month and if something comes up such as job bonus or raise etc. I will put more into it. I am pretty ignorant with how the whole market works and that's why I want to get into it. Something new to learn and something that is always changing. I work in the IT world (and have a strong passion for it) so I follow up on the latest and greatest products/inventions. I'd like to stick with that sector for the most part.

16-01-18,41lnbz,Buy Low and Sell High is Easy for You to Say,"Are you frustrated with the market downturn we've seen in the past few weeks? If so, you might need to make some adjustments to your portfolio, i.e. 401(k), 403(b), etc. William Bernstein, author of The Intelligent Asset Allocator said, ""The essence of effective portfolio construction is the use of a large number of poorly correlated assets.""

What does he mean by ""poorly correlated?"" I'll get to that in a minute. First, I want to quote another master of investment strategy. Roger G. Ibbotson is emeritus professor of the practice of finance at Yale School of Management. He said, ""On average, 94 percent of the variability of returns and 100 percent of the absolute level of return is explained by asset allocation.""

Now let's summarize these two statements. A viable portfolio that is poised to make decent returns has two characteristics: 1. It is diversified 2. Have multiple assets that don't behave identically. In other words, asset A doesn't move in the same direction as asset B when the stock market goes up and down. 

Beta is the measurement of a particular investment’s behavior to its index. Let’s say you own ABC stock. The ABC stock is a Large Cap Growth stock. The Russell 1000 Large Cap Growth  is an index made up of large-cap growth stocks ONLY. That means it has growth stocks in it and nothing else.

If the Russell 1000 went up or down 3 percent, and ABC stock went up or down 3 percent, that would mean that ABC stock has a Beta of +1, (100%), meaning it matches its index. If, however, the Russell 1000 went up or down 3 percent, but ABC only went up or down 1.5 percent, that would mean that ABC stock has a Beta of +.5, (50%), hence, less volatility than the overall large cap market. 

When you add asset classes to your portfolio, you begin to reduce your Beta which reduces your volatility. “But, doesn’t that mean I also lose on the upside when the market goes up?” Actually no. The KEY is to rebalance from one asset class to another to capture gains and take advantage of sales. This further reduces your risk and increases your returns.

 But, for diversification to work, it has to involve more than just owning different assets (or the appearance of different ones). They HAVE to be assets that behave differently from each other. Look for securities with Betas of +1 and -1, and you will gain the opportunity to buy low and sell high.

16-01-19,41p951,ELI5: Options basics,"Check my understanding, please.  I often don't do well with they way other people explain things, so it helps to put it in my own words and have it checked by those more knowledgeable.

1.  For every transaction, there has to be two active investors, correct?  One to sell the option and one to buy it, be it a call or put?
2.  Is selling a call essentially the same action as buying a put?
3.  If #2 is correct, then is the point of selling a call or put speculation that the option will go wrong for the investor, they don't exercise, and you pocket the premium?

Buying a call:  this seems the easiest to understand.  I think the stock will go up over X timeframe, and believe that it will be higher than Option strike + premium.  So a $10 strike with a $1 premium on the option means I'm betting it will be above $11 before the option expires.

Selling a call:  Covered, I understand.  Naked is infinite possible downside, correct?  But I get how it's covered, if I sell a naked call and bet wrong, then I'm on the hook to buy the shares for the guy who bought my option.

Buying (selling) a put:  So I bet the stock will go down from strike price + premium.  If I'm right, does the other side of the transaction just give me the monetary difference, or does stock actually have to be sold?  Covering a call makes sense, but I don't get how covering a put happens.

I've read The Four Pillars of Investing and there are some mentions about the Efficient Market Hypothesis. It seems to make sense topically, that the market prices reflect all available information and therefore makes it difficult to reliably ""beat"" the market. 

Then I read The Little Book That Beats the Market and in chapter 5 or 6 there is an interesting question. If a company trades for X today, and then tomorrow trades for 1.5x or -.5x tomorrow, then the companies value must have changed according to investors. He puts it in perspective of a company like General Motors - do they all of the sudden have half the manufacturing costs? Did their sales double overnight?  The author's explanation is that it doesn't matter - people just act crazy.

So the EMH says that prices reflect information accurately and account for value. And the Little Book states that market prices swing wildly for no reason at all.

Am I incorrect in my understanding of these concepts? Or are these just opposing axioms in the investing world?",9

Fund|Purchase per year                    
:--|:--                          
Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)|$1500 (30%)
Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS)|$2500 (50%)
Vanguard Total International Bond ETF (BNDX)|$1000 (20%)
**Total**|**$5,000**|

I am investing from a country where Vanguard does not offer its index funds directly to, thus the ETFs. Moreover, with a once a year purchase, my fees will be minimal. Stockbroking commission is at 0.275% or minimum $20, the latter which I will be paying x3 every year. 

I want to benefit from dollar cost averaging and spend the same amount on each fund every year, but at the same time I hope to maintain the allocation balance of:

Total US market (VTI) - 30%

Total global market (VXUS) - 50%

Total global bonds (BNDX) - 20%

**Question 1: How does this portfolio look?**

**Question 2: How do I achieve dollar cost averaging while controlling the asset allocation at the same time?** I will also want to increase my bond allocation proportionately as I age (perhaps increasing 5% at every 5th year). If I want to keep the 30%-50%-20% ratio (for the first few years), I wouldn't be able to invest exactly $1500, $2500 and $1000 every year right?

**Question 3: I know that past performance is no indication of the future, but supposing I use historical averages like 9.7% for the US stock market, what kind of return can I reasonably expect with this portfolio in 25 years?**


**Question 4: How do I reinvest dividends with these ETFs? It is automatic or must I make another purchase and incur another fee? Do these ETFs have DRIP plans?**

16-01-20,41rmdk,$ATVI Earnings plays,"Just thought I would throw some ideas around on ActivisionBlizzard's upcoming earnings report (Feb 4 unconfirmed date).

$ATVI has beaten earnings estimates in 5 consecutive quarters, and, more importantly, 3 consecutive Q4's dating back to 2012.  Here is some data:


**Q4 2012: .78 EPS vs. .72 consensus**

Feb 1, 2013 price: 11.65

Feb 15, 2013 price: 14.37

**23.3% increase**



**Q4 2013: .79 EPS vs. .73 consensus**

Jan 31, 2014 price: 17.13

Feb 14, 2014 price: 19.80

**15.5% increase**



**Q4 2014: .94 EPS vs. .88 consensus**

Jan 30, 2015 price: 20.90

Feb 13, 2015 price: 23.11

**10.6% increase**



It seems likely to me that ATVI beats on Q4 earnings again.  Consensus is .86, 2 cents per share lower than last year.  From what I can tell, that looks too low...

It is really hard to find concrete sales numbers, but the general consensus seems to be that Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 is selling the best a COD title has since BO2 in 2012.

http://www.polygon.com/2015/11/11/9715060/call-of-duty-black-ops-3-sales-advanced-warfare-ghosts

http://fortune.com/2015/11/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-3-sales/


In addition, Destiny: TTK broke the day one digital downloads record for PS4.   Revenue from TTK definitely won't be as high as that from Destiny's original release last year, but the cost of production for TTK was likely minimal compared to the record $500 million production cost for Destiny.

Both COD and TTK profits should also benefit from the continuing shift from physical disc sales to higher-margin digital downloads.

Also, the new Guitar Hero sold well probably?

All in all, I think we could see comparable EPS to last year's .94.

**Now to the point, how priced in do you guys think an earnings beat is at this point?**  Trading at a P/E of nearly 24 and in a bearish market environment, could ATVI make any significant jump, assuming it beats on earnings?  I'm deciding between 3 ways to play this:

* Buy Feb 19 Calls
* Buy Shares 
* Sell Feb 19 Puts

One final note: ATVI should complete its acquisition and integration of King Digital soon.  KING had an EPS of 1.75 with 315M shares, and ATVI has a TTM EPS of 1.47 with 731M shares.  That means, without any growth to KING's business, the acquisition has the potential to improve ATVI's EPS by around  50% once it is fully integrated.  I think an even higher current P/E could definitely be justified on this fact alone. 

I'd love to hear some feedback.  What do you guys think?",8

* SPY = +46.97%
* SPXL = +171.78% (3.65 x SPY)
* SPXS = -81.67% (-1.73 x SPY)

So they don't exactly correspond 3x and -3x, but they do seem to accurately follow their described path (SPXL runs higher than SPY, and SPXS runs inverse) so if someone wanted to make these investments - is this not fulfilling their bet?

I've read about decay and everything, but SPXL does not seem to be decaying?

I'd like to know the danger of holding these long-term. 
For example, if one thought that the S&amp;P would rise on Jan 21 2011 and bought SPXL accordingly, they would have made +171.78% (rather than if they bought SPY).

16-01-19,41pvhh,"Let's talk about the a dividend stock strategy vs. investing in the S&amp;P 500.","I've been doing quite a bit of research on different strategies(swing trading, value investing, technical analysis, index funds, mutual funds, bonds) and it seems to me like dividend stocks are the way to. If I can build a portfolio with 5 solid, well-managed companies with great dividend payout history, would it beat simply investing in the S&amp;P 500? 

For example, say I have 10,000 dollars to invest. I put it all into AT&amp;T, which has a great dividend history which turns out to be 290 shares. They pay about .5/share every quarter. So thats 580 dollars per year in dividends alone. After 7 years that would add up to 4,085 in profit plus 10,000 initial investment to make $14,085, and that's not taking into consider dividend reinvestment each year.

If I had put that initial 10,000 into $SPY in July 2009 when the S&amp;P500 is making an enormous climb after the 2008 market crash. That price is about $100/share. I could then sell it 7 years later at about $200/share. That would yield $10,000 over a 7 year span which is about $1,428 per year for a grand total of $20,000 after 7 years. Again this is without reinvestment each year. 

The last option sounds great, but for this you have to get the time the market PERFECTLY and know exactly when to get in and out. Which is why I think a dividend strategy would be best in the long run. Anyone can get dividends, barely anyone is an excellent timer of the market. Am I missing something in this calculation? What are your thoughts on setting up a portfolio for the dividend strategy vs. S&amp;P?

EDIT: So I didn't do my example of the $T stock correctly as I only accounted for actual dividends not stock price. If I bought and sold $T at the same price, the grand total would be significantly more for the $T portfolio because the stock, like most others, did well during that 7 year climb.

And what he discovered could be significant. To answer this important question, he enlisted the help of Carolyn Boroden, a technician who runs FibonacciQueen.com and a colleague of Cramer's at RealMoney.com.

&gt;The reason Cramer turned to Boroden is she previously nailed calling the peak of the S&amp;P. When Cramer last checked in with her in June, she said it was time to get cautious about the S&amp;P.

longer time frame chart
https://www.tradingview.com/x/1v6gwgQ1/

So you can see the chart here. This chart was done a while ago. I just find it odd that where I draw the lines, the SPY will 80-90% of the time play off these lines. I use a visual approach to plotting IV. 

It goes like this:

* 1) Look at previous high and low range. Mark those out.
* 2) Divide it in half equally
* 3) divide each of those halves equally 
* 4) you will be left 1/4ths. 
* 5) take the height of the 1/4th  and then continue to apply it above and below each line, until you have a bunch of lines that are all equally spaced.

From what I've seen, most stocks and the spy, generally closes and plays off these lines. I don't really know why, and the explanations people have given me don't really answer the question. 

If you want to try it for yourself, just go to the SPY chart go to the 1-month time frame, as far back as it will go and try mapping it out for yourself. Its not 100% accurate, but generally the price will play around these price points. Dividing it into 1/8ths or 1/16ths works also. 

My belief is the higher fraction determines the time frame. Each level represents a possible rebound point.  

So  the question is: why do stocks prices play off these lines? ",2

16-01-19,41qe3t,UWTI - possible entry point - TA,"https://www.tradingview.com/x/zl7jmnrX/

So i started my small position in at $2.35. My current mapped out pivot points are. My earlier post had I think 1.75ish, but that was give or take a few pennies. Can't be 100% accurate.

$1.55
$0.90
$0.10

I'm assuming all fundamentals for oil has been priced in already. Not sure what other news can come out, considering we know that IRAN is coming in and Saudies aren't really slowing down production yet. Some N.A getting wiped out probably won't affect it too much, but would maybe cause it to rally instead since its supposed to reduce the supply. 

So my belief is, since it broke the 2.30ish line and did not rally, I'm guessing it will travel down to the next levels which are $ 1.50, if that doesn't hold/rally off of, then the $0.90 to $1.00 area.  I will likely be picking up more shares at each of these levels if they hit. I'm not good with setting stop losses, but you can do that instead of averaging down.

In hindsight and for the future, instead of committing equal portions of your max risked amount to a trade, I think it might be better to contribute a smaller portion initially. 

For example, if my max loss for this trade is $500 and there are 8 possible entry points, instead of doing $62.5 per entry (12.5%), it might be better to start with half that amount and increase with each subsequent level.

On the flip side, the fund manager short sells the index (in my example the S&amp;P) such that the market fluctuation risk is eliminated and you are left with asset specific risk.

16-01-19,41qkld,Stocks or Bonds or Savings or DailyFantasySports?,"I have somehow saved $36,000 in the past 2 years. It's largely in part due to this savings account I had set up that automatically withdrew money from my checking for 2 years. Now thats all said and done. I'm curious as to what to do with some of the money. 

About me. 27 years old making $60,000-64,000 per year after taxes and bonuses in California. So take home pay monthly is around $5000. No debts except car payments 3 years left. All credit cards paid off monthly in full. No student loans. Besides the $36,000 saved, I also have my 3 month emergency fund. I will most likely open up a Roth account this year as well. After all my expenses (rent,car,food,life,etc.) I can afford to save about $1500 a month. The $36,000 isn't money I'm going to spend (yet) or need and will continue to grow. I will most likely end up saving another $36,000 in the next 2 years. However this term around I want to take a bigger risk. I'm thinking of saving $30,000 in the bank and taking a risk with $6,000. Obviously my title says it all...

What do you think the best way to go is? 

Saving solidly for 2 years in a savings account netted me something like $475 paid interest which is a decent amount but seems like I could have done more. I honestly had no reason to save except for the fact that I wanted to stop spending money on stupid shit...now I don't know what to do with it...my parents are aware I have this money saved and are trying to persuade me to buy a condo...(which...is still on the table) 

DailyFantasySports / Sportsbetting - seems to be the dumbest option but it's more of an interest in sports than to actually make money from... 

edit. The $6,000 I'm planning on investing more aggressively isn't something I'll cry over if I lose it. Yes, it'll be a big loss but not one I can't recover from. All suggestions are welcome. ",1

I'm 21 years old and about to graduate with my BS in Finance. I have an Analyst position lined up in June with a starting salary of $47,025 (including annual STI) in Florida. I have been saving money over the years to pay for tuition each semester, but I now have enough to start investing. 

I think I will start by opening a Roth IRA this month and maxing that out, and then contributing (and hopefully maxing out) to the 401K through my employer. They give a great match (100% up to 6% of income) and ultimately I'd like to invest as much as I can to be able to be financially free by my mid-thirties or so. I have created a budget in order to get an idea of what my maximum spending could be based on the future value of my investments (assuming 8% interest), and it is fairly tight. 

Does anyone have any tips regarding this topic, especially with a starting salary in the 40s? I would appreciate any advice!",3

As a complete newbie, how are these two different? Was the US circuit breaker criticized as much as the Chinese one?

16-01-20,41shey,Alright you fucks - HERE is how you should have played Netflix,"YOLO on something else.  When stocks with a lot of people's interest (which equals liquidity in the options) and a lot of historical volatility around earnings have earnings you SELL premium based on that volatility

1. There is ZERO WAY OF KNOWING which way it is going to trade. Period. Full stop. If you're going to say otherwise do not respond to this thread, make your own because I don't want anyone to get confused by your misinformation. Learn to accept that there is no reason to believe it will go up vs. down.

2. This is NOT the time to YOLO.  This is an excellent time to make some money by being conservative in a situation that lets you make money even when being conservative.  When you see the available options it is VERY tempting to push the limit and take more profit but that's how you get fucked.  And you're actually double fucked because not only do you literally lose money, but you miss out on the once every three month opportunity to make money

So here's the play:

1. You have to wait until relatively close to market close on earnings day - Netflix bounces around $5-$10 near earnings and that affects things wildly for a ~$110 stock - you can't make a trade the day before when it's at $100 and then before earnings even announces it's up by $5 or $10 and your ranges are totally off.  Wait until at least 3pm

2. Only trade in the weekly options that expire right after earnings. You can trade in the monthlies that expire next but that's more risk and only if you know what you're doing. So in this case you want the January 22nd options

3.  SELL.  I repeat... SELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL strangles.  And you want to sell them at strikes that are at least one standard deviation away from the current price, plus a little more for comfort.  As long as you're 1 SD out you can gauge your own risk but you MUST understand that, on average, NFLX moves 17% on earnings.  That's fucking enormous as an average.  It closed today  at 107.89. That means that even excluding the actual SD implied in the options you're only safe at a range of 90/125.  

The whole goal here is to make money - not to be a hero

So I sold 85/130 (it's much more liquid to sell on round 5 increment strikes but you can squeeze a bit more if you want to)

I got $1.23 per contract

Could I have made a lot more trading NFLX earnings a lot of other ways at a lot of other times?  Of course. And I did that as well.  But I saved a lot of capital to trade 55 of these, and so I collected $6,765 on a bet that NFLX would not move 20-25% on earnings after I had all the market information except the earnings themselves.  That's a bet I'll take all day.

This free fall trends with the strength of the local economies. The Canadian economy is struggling, while the American one is (relatively) healthy. Why does the exchange rate trend with respect to the local economies? 


Here are the factors that come to mind for currency valuation (to me, an economic dummy):

* Inflation (not the case in Canada at the moment)
* If the government were to print more money (again inflation, and not the case at the moment in Canada).
* Increased risk of the country defaulting. This risk has probably inched up somewhat in Canada, but not anywhere as much as the currency drop would suggest.


None of those seem to explain what's happened to the sad CAD.

16-01-20,41vufb,"In response to Chipotle's ""free food"" policy","(This post is in response to [this post and the Chipotle-sponsored ""adverticle"" within](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/41twbc/chipotle_will_be_giving_out_more_free_food_to_win/))


I'm highly pessimistic on Chipotle for the next two years and have been for the past four months.  Allow me to critically-read this article for you.  Here are some interesting tid-bits from the linked ""adverticle"" as to why you should be pessimistic too:

&gt; The restaurant chain has doubled the amount of free food stores can give away to customers, said co-CEO Monty Moran

Zero times anything is still zero.  No one I've known has ever gotten anything for free from Chipotle, and they are regularly shorted on the basic ingredients.  (Guacamole has gone from being served with a ladle, to a tablespoon, to a teaspoon, price constant throughout.)  Let's get this clear: this article is a cheap advertisement in disguise.  Chipotle execs are hoping ""FREE FOOD!!!! AT CHIPOTLE!!!"" will get people into their stores, all for the price of this boring interview.

&gt; While the practice has existed at the company since the ""old days,"" it had diminished, said CFO Jack Hartung during an interview. ""We've always had it, but it just kind of drifted to such a low-grade level that it was kind of non-existent."" 

Hartung casually acts like this practice went bad on it's own.  That's lazy management.  Food comps should clearly be encouraged or be discouraged, not allowed to deteriorate like a neglected avocado.  What other managerial-policies have you allowed to drift to ""low-grade levels""?

&gt; Recently though, the company sent an email out detailing just how much restaurants could increase their giveaways and reward customers, Hartung said. Moran declined to share the specific allowance.

More artful dodging on behalf of CMG's executives proving my point that this is really just a cheap advertising piece entirely lacking in substance.

&gt; Starting next February, the chain also plans to ramp up marketing in hopes of winning customers back, said Chief Marketing and Development Officer Mark Crumpacker in a presentation. 

This means that this quarter's sales were awful and are going to look awful when published.  Whenever a firm ""ramps up"" marketing efforts, it *always means* the current and recent sales figures were awful!  Watch for the steep drop in CMG price on Feb 2 when weeks of sales-less operation are finally put in ink.

&gt; Hartung pegged the ongoing margin hit from additional costs of food safety improvements to be about 100 to 200 basis points.

Margin of what?  Stop being so vague!  And say ""percentage points"", for Christ's sake!  We're not talking about quarters-of-one-percent change here.  He is using the phrase ""basis points"" to confuse and downplay.  Besides, one to two percentage points of what? If this were a 1-2% increase in sales, that'd be pretty spectacular for a company this size.  Should we be concerned about this magnitude of *decrease* in sales? He is being purposefully vague and using investment jargon to cloak how much they have failed.

&gt; While Chipotle will eventually recoup some of its costs through a price increase, Hartung said this would not happen until probably 2017

**OH REALLY?**  This FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLAR LUXURY-BURRITO COMPANY with lavish TWENTY PERCENT FOOD-INDUSTRY OPERATING MARGINS is going to *raise prices* to off-set the cost of allowing employees to take more unpaid sick days and to cover the added expense of spending a few extra minutes during training to teach employees to wash their hands a little longer after using the toilet?!  You've got to be shitting me!  Friends and I have stopped going to Chipotle because their burritos are already *too* expensive and they are *too* stingy on the portions.  Give me a fucking break about a price increase!",3

2) Some other douche writes an article about how there's debt and that's it. It's a horrible investment and if you buy you're guaranteed to lose. They also give no insight as to why theur theory is correct

And to top it off you bought more SBUX on what you thought was a buying opportunity two weeks ago and lost more! 

CHILL. 

What's your time-frame? If it's 20/30 years you're golden. This is literally the opportunity you've been waiting for. Buy more at a discount if you have excess free cash and continue to make regular contributions. Go look at a S&amp;P 500 chart for the past 50 years and imagine the sweet returns you would've had if you always were able to purchase 15% below lifetime highs. How many times have you looked at 2009 and imagined how great it would've been to purchase almost any equity then. Could the market tank another 15% or more? Sure, but just keep to the strategy, don't buy shitty companies, and don't use money you can't afford to wait on for a while.

If your time-frame is a few years well it's a little harder to tell, you're still probably fine. If you're freaking out because you needed this money in 4 months to put a down payment on a house well maybe you should just rip off the band aid right now and sell, or hold and gamble and hope for the best- your choice. Either way hopefully you learned a lesson that millions of people have learned too many times. 

If China's economy tanks are you still going to put on your Nike shoes in the morning and go for a run? If a hundred oil companies go bust and default on their loans are you going to stop eating Kellogg cereal? Just like every other time investors feared the world ending something tells me it'll work itself out over time. If not we'll all have bigger problems anyways.

16-01-20,41twgz,Is buying oil stocks on this market good investment?,,12
16-01-20,41twmu,Buying your way down Shell/oil,"EDIT: Sorry picked the wrong title for this...


So I am one of those suckers who has RDS stock I bought some more a few days ago because it was trading under 18€ and lets be honest here in the long term oil will return to old levels. Now RDSA.AS is trading under 17€, which kinda makes me want to buy more, because we are aproaching the lows of the 08-09 crisis, however if you look at past reports you will find that the EPS in 09 was 2.04€ and now (if I did not make a huge mistake) we are looking at a 1.50€ EPS if not lower, which if we assume the same cost of capital would equal a share price of 11.76€, however since the risk free rate has gone down quite a bit we can assume that the cost of capital was also reduced giving us the fair share price of about 15€, so this makes me think it might be better to wait until we get close to 15€ to buy. I was wondering if any other people who hold shell have similair or perhaps completly different ideas of what the ""fair share price"" should be? 


Over the next 1-2 years the EPS could go even lower as oil gets cheaper. And as that EPS goes down it would be smart to buy more shares, because eventually oil will go up. I believe the middle east can pump oil for about 10$ per barrel. The question is will they go so far as to sell it for only about 10$ a barrel? I doubt it since they would be throwing away a lot of cash. Does anybody know the ""optimum"" oil price for the middle east, aka the one that maximalizes annual profits aka max(demand(price,supply)*price)? The demand being a function of the oil price and supply of course.


And a final question that relates to politics. On the short term cheap oil is hurting the west more than it is helping. So why in the world are we lifting sanctions against Iran? How does lifting sanctions help us? Last time I checked western politicians are supposed to support the interest of the westerners not some random people in the middle east they have their own politicians.",8
16-01-20,41w7s5,Hedging low gasoline prices?,"I currently spend around 120€ per month in gas.Would it make sense to hedge against price rises now that it is so low to protect myself from ieventual price increases?

Realistically, the ETF would work as a 2x leverage, as 50% of the price of gas in my country is fixed by the government; so a 100% oil price increase would only cause a 50% price increase on gas.

Does it make sense buying into an oil fund now? How much for my expenses? (1440/year). Any comment welcome, as I am pretty new to this kind of investment.

16-01-20,41wct6,"LPT: How to hack your broker's web portal to boost your gains.","This is a simple trick that I have been using for years to get incredible returns.

Open your portfolio in a web browser and prepare to navigate to the webpage where you can buy/sell.

Now, once you click the link to that page, immediately click the ""x"" on your browser. No, not the one in the top right (though that would help most of you), but the one next to the URL bar. 

If you did it right, the page will load, but the price shown will not update! Do this a couple of times throughout the day.

Near 4:00 EST you should have 10-15 tabs open all with different prices. If you don't, this won't work. You fucked up.

Simply buy the ones where the price is low, and sell where it is high for instant profit. You have to use a market order, since the prices listed on the page are market prices. Limit orders will do nothing and your account may even be flagged by the SEC for attempted manipulation.

This works because the price is frozen when you stop the page load. Your broker has a fiduciary duty to give you that price. They take on the counterparty risk, you take home the profit.

P.S. This is why Robinhood doesn't charge fees. Because they don't have a web trading portal they take on much less risk serving you.

P.P.S. this may not work with all brokers, contact them first to find out.",100

16-01-20,41wt7i,"Vanguard Total US vs S&amp;P 500","Apologies for contributing to this sub's reputation for being obsessed with passive investing/index funds. This is a bit of a semantic question, but it came up as I juggled my desires to invest in large caps, mid caps, and small caps. 

When people discuss Vanguard portfolios and such, the most conservative, simple, common advice is to get your domestic equity position through VTI (Vanguard Total US) or the equivalent index fund. This makes sense as it tracks every sector and every size of company in the market, more or less.

However, there seems to be a perception that investing in the S&amp;P 500, like VOO, is a (very) slightly more aggressive strategy, since it's more concentrated. On the other hand, VTI is basically VOO with an added position in small and mid caps, which are usually considered more aggressive, more volatile, and higher return over the very long term. So wouldn't VTI actually be the slightly more aggressive, slightly more volatile option, with a higher long term expected ROI, than VOO? Obviously VOO would be the preferred choice if you expect greater return from large caps, as we've seen recently, but what other factors play into it? Would you consider VOO the less volatile, ""safer"" choice?

Not to beat a dead horse, but I do realize that these funds are pretty similar in return, makeup, and volatility. Just trying to get a discussion here.

I have a handful of friends that are purchasing items from Alibaba and orders are fulfilled by Amazon. If you're not familiar with this, this is how it works.
You buy an item off Alibaba in bulk. Amazon takes care of shipping and storage. You just have to maintain your store on Amazon and market the product across social media. I have friends doing this business model as well as setting up a store with Shopify and pulling in over 70K a year.

Do you think this type of business will be the new way of millennials and younger generation? Anyone can literally open up a store on ETSY and they just get a % of sales, while Shopify is subscription based.

Thoughts? Pros...cons...anyone with personal experience running stores on these platforms?

EDIT: Just want to throw it out there that I shop for my wife on Pinterest and Etsy for clothing and other random stuff because business owners on there sell the most creative/artistic stuff you can't really find anywhere else. Truthfully it's a chick haven, but I'm starting to find myself going to it more and more. The guy shit is actually really cool. I completely feel ETSY and even Shopify are overvalued right now given the state of the economy, but if ETSY goes any lower I'll definitely pull the trigger at some point.",0

16-01-20,41wx08,"Investment and professional day trading community, live stream, and chatroom.","Whether you invest long or short term, the skill set of learning how to execute your entries with accuracy, ride your wins hard, and cut your losses short is always something you should have in your arsenal. Day traders are experts at this process, and a good layer of discipline and money/risk management is how we stay in the game for as long as we have.

You only make money in trading when you don't lose money trading. That's the mindset of a professional trader. 

Who we are: we are a not-for-profit, free of charge, chat-based community of 50 or so professional day traders, fund managers, fixed income traders, and even a mix of aspiring amateur/casual  traders who have all been trading together for years and keeping in touch through various platforms (facebook, skype, etc...) and now we are opening the doors to the public. Most of us, me included, do this as a profession. It's not a hobby. I'm an older guy with an engineering degree, but since 2008 I have been trading and this is what I now do full time.  

The goal we have is to fill in the void that exists in the world. And that is to have a place for traders to hang out and sharpen our skills and help others learn the craft. I'm not talking about reiterating Investopedia charting and candle techniques or day 1 stuff, I'm talking out trading the algos and market makers and beating them at their own game. So when searching this out, I've found that about 100% of places out there just talk about trading, or trades, or pick stocks for people, talk penny stocks, etc...and rarely is there a place for people to really learn *how* to trade, from basic order entry and timing, all the way to momentum decay, contract contango, spotting the switch between buy and sell programs, and other advanced techniques... 

Trading techniques are universal, and every analysis requires a bullish and a bearish possibility, so we look to avoid picking stocks and instead help each other with a neutral insight into both bullish and bearish positions so they can make stronger judgement calls on their own positions. So when someone just shouts at you ""buy DWTI"" in a chat room or website, that really means nothing to a trader. Where? When? How? What timing? What profit target? How much to risk for what profit? [Here is an example of something we'd share about a trade.](http://imgur.com/7igIKLO). Say you wanted to short oil, right? How do you know the best place to short? That picture is just an explanation of basic support and resistance techniques which literally is my setup as a professional trader; but that helps me manage risk, trade size, or just know when to be cash when waiting for my next move. I wouldn't recommend anyone long or short, rather I would suggest both cases and you use your fundamental belief to make the correct entry into whatever position you want (bull or bear). There is a right time to try to buy/short for each case, and trading is nothing but looking at if/then's for both sides of a trade. We are always talking about this kind of stuff, so you guys are welcome to follow us in the chat room and pick our brains about how you can improve your trade in whatever instrument you are invested in or currently trading. This would go along with reddit communities such as this one, and definitely not take away from the awesome things you guys do here. As far as I'm aware you guys don't have a chatroom for live trading chat, so at minimum come make some trader friends and learn the business. I learned how to trade by picking the brains of other professional traders for years, and that's really the only way you learn how. It's kind of like... being a magician, the tricks of the trade are usually highly guarded and not readily available. We want to change that :)

And to reiterate, this service is for free, forever. We're linking up with the online communities to make our existence known for the first time these last few weeks. In addition to this, we are about to start live streaming /cl futures trading once everything gets set up, which will also be free of charge. That way you can watch live day trading in action by professional traders. As far as I know, this doesn't exist yet. 

I can understand why people would be skeptical of ""free"" anything, but the engineer in me loves to remind the world that it took a team of people to put a rocket on the moon. And with a team of people eyeballing the markets, it just means better trades for all of us. So that's the incentive... having pros and amateurs alike bouncing ideas off of each other.

So come check us out, the invite link is [here!](https://daytraderparadise.herokuapp.com/) You can use a real or throwaway email address if you'd like to remain anonymous. There is something for everyone. 

And of course, happy trading from all of us over at DTP!

16-01-20,41uvo5,Warren Buffett and the big picture.,"
""The unconventional, but inescapable, conclusion to be drawn from the past fifty years is that it has been far safer to invest in a diversified collection of American businesses than to invest in securities – Treasuries, for example – whose values have been tied to American currency. That was also true in the preceding half-century, a period including the Great Depression and two world wars. Investors should heed this history. To one degree or another it is almost certain to be repeated during the next century"".


Stocks are volatile but less risky than currency over the long term.  Volatility is not risk.


Stock prices will always be far more volatile than cash-equivalent holdings. Over the long term, however, currency-denominated instruments are riskier investments – far riskier investments – than widely-diversified stock portfolios that are bought over time and that are owned in a manner invoking only token fees and commissions. That lesson has not customarily been taught in business schools, where volatility is almost universally used as a proxy for risk. Though this pedagogic assumption makes for easy teaching, it is dead wrong: Volatility is far from synonymous with risk. Popular formulas that equate the two terms lead students, investors and CEOs astray.


Owning equities for a day or a week or a year in the short term is far riskier than cash


It is true, of course, that owning equities for a day or a week or a year is far riskier (in both nominal and purchasing-power terms) than leaving funds in cash-equivalents. That is relevant to certain investors – say, investment banks – whose viability can be threatened by declines in asset prices and which might be forced to sell securities during depressed markets. Additionally, any party that might have meaningful near-term needs for funds should keep appropriate sums in Treasuries or insured bank deposits.


Short term declines of a diversified equity portfolio, bought over time with a multi-decade horizon, are unimportant


For the great majority of investors, however, who can – and should – invest with a multi-decade horizon, quotational declines are unimportant. Their focus should remain fixed on attaining significant gains in purchasing power over their investing lifetime. For them, a diversified equity portfolio, bought over time, will prove far less risky than dollar-based securities.


Getting out of the market during a crash will hurt you more than staying in the market in the long run


If the investor, instead, fears price volatility, erroneously viewing it as a measure of risk, he may, ironically, end up doing some very risky things. Recall, if you will, the pundits who six years ago bemoaned falling stock prices and advised investing in “safe” Treasury bills or bank certificates of deposit. People who heeded this sermon are now earning a pittance on sums they had previously expected would finance a pleasant retirement. (The S&amp;P 500 was then below 700; now it is about 2,100.) If not for their fear of meaningless price volatility, these investors could have assured themselves of a good income for life by simply buying a very low-cost index fund whose dividends would trend upward over the years and whose principal would grow as well (with many ups and downs, to be sure)"".

Market forecasters will fill your ear but will never fill your wallet

Investors, of course, can, by their own behaviour, make stock ownership highly risky. And many do. Active trading, attempts to “time” market movements, inadequate diversification, the payment of high and unnecessary fees to managers and advisors, and the use of borrowed money can destroy the decent returns that a life-long owner of equities would otherwise enjoy. Indeed, borrowed money has no place in the investor’s tool kit: Anything can happen anytime in markets. And no advisor, economist, or TV commentator – and definitely not Charlie nor I – can tell you when chaos will occur. Market forecasters will fill your ear but will never fill your wallet.",30

It took about 7 years to get that money back.

In 2007 we lost about 50 percent of s and p 500 and it took 2 years until 2009.

And then it took about 6 years later to regain all that was lost.

If this hold true now. We will lose 50 percent value of the s&amp;p so about 1200. And that will happen in 2017. In 2021 we will regain what we lost.

The Fed raised rates in December for the first time in more than nine years. Investors had been expecting four more hikes in 2016 based on policymaker projections at the time. But the horrid start to the new year in financial markets has scaled back those forecasts.
Addressing concerns about China, Gorman said the Chinese are facing huge transitional changes from an investment- and management-led economy to a more consumer- and services-driven model.

16-01-21,41x5xc,What do I misunderstand about this options trade?,"I've started learning about options and been drawing pay-off diagrams and so on. I understand basic buying put/calls and selling them.

So I've read about the **long straddle**, i.e buying a call and a put for the same strike price on a stock, so that you will profit if the gain from either the down or up movement exceeds your costs (option price and commissions). So you exercise the option that made you money and let the other expire worthless. Since you benefit from both up and down there is a high likelihood of profiting. Especially if you use long-term options of months or even more than a year until expiration. 

But this all sounds too good to be true, so I must be missing something huge. What is it?

What I don't understand is this:
 - if options allow you to profit with such low risk, **why are people even buying stocks at all?** even a long only strategy based on buying calls seems to be much much safer than buying an actual stock and possibly see it decline by 40%... Which can't happen with a call, since you can always just lose what you paid for it at most, which is ridiculously little compared to the underlying stock. And the only reason to hold stock would be the dividend...
 - how is a **long straddle** so insanely attractive? If you use options with 12 months left until expiry, wouldn't you say it's very likely that the underlying stock price will have diverged significantly from the current price by then? It seems like the odds are far too good on this bet for it to be possible!

So as you can see I'm a total noob. I feel like it is obvious that what I just wrote cannot be true, yet I can't come up with the reason for why it cannot be true. Help!

**EDIT: I didn't know that if the option price is 5$, that is 5$ per one of the 100 underlying shares, i.e. actually 500$ as total cost. Thanks for explaining that!**",1

Does this really make sense for everyone?

Our younger readers particularly are heavily weighted towards stocks (and even worse towards the more fashionable, frothy names - I won't give tickers but you know which ones). Portfolios that are close to 100% equities are not uncommon after the long bull market. These people are now realizing that maybe it wasn't such a good idea and [some](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/41snbp/anyone_had_enough/) are practically soiling themselves. Compounding their woes was a virulent misconception that bonds are terrible investments once the Fed started hiking rates, never mind their wonderful diversification properties in just this sort of economic slowdown scenario (not to mention their positive carry).

But hindsight is 20/20 (although some saw all this coming last summer). Considering their current predicament, what should people do now? The default answer for their existing portfolios seems to be head-in-the-sand inaction. Few can be convinced to take a loss (""hey it's only a paper loss now"") short of a 40-50% drawdown even if they are clearly overallocated to stocks. (Remember that it these decisions don't need to be all or nothing.) Everyone is gambling big for a rebound. This is classic ""get-evenitis.""

**So bottom-line, people won't sell existing stock positions yet they continue to plow even more cash on a monthly basis into stocks. To me this is the height of folly.** Here is an opportunity to lower their stock allocations (albeit gradually) with new cash and yet people are doing the opposite and buying even more stocks. Madness.

The primary defense seems to be that ""stocks are on sale."" But are you really confident that many stocks are not merely going from overvalued to mildly overvalued or fairly valued? I'd be more convinced that stocks are cheap if we have a real 40-50% crash. Being a ""long-term"" investor doesn't change this calculus.

An even more important point is one of diversification against a range of scenarios.  Let's keep it simple and reduce it to just two. (1) The market rebounds relatively quickly. In this case, you were better off putting your incremental cash into stocks. These new purchases make a bit of money and more importantly your existing portfolio rebounds. This is the happy (upside) scenario. (2) The market crashes. You didn't put all your new cash into the market, but instead kept it in cash or better yet bought bonds. So now you really can take advantage of some bargains. This is the bad (downside) scenario, but at least you've mitigated some of the damage.

Investing is about managing risks. In scenario 1, the market (and your portfolio) rebounds so you would do just fine whether you made a little extra from DCA'ing additional funds into stocks at a small discount or not. You are getting greedy and looking for a cherry on top of your ice cream sundae. In scenario 2, you are hurting since your portfolio really takes a hit. But since you kept your additional monthly contributions in cash/bonds, you can now really benefit from the situation. Of course, you're still way underwater on your portfolio, but at least you have partially insured yourself. The additional cash might be substantial if you are getting your annual bonus now or are realizing some proceeds from selling your house, exercising options in your company stock, etc. *In my mind, it's much better to give up a bit in the good scenario to protect myself in the bad scenario.*

**TL;DR: For people who are heavily allocated towards stocks, further DCA investments into stocks seems very foolish since you are forgoing the opportunity to reduce your allocation to stocks (without selling current stocks holdings for a loss, which many cannot bring themselves to do) and not hedging the downside scenario in which stocks fall considerably further by keeping your new cash on the sidelines.**",2

What do I do? I know I was dumb and made a mistake but I don't want to compound it. If I think Fit will come back I should hold or wait for a buyout, but I'm worried it's going to get a lot worse. 

Do you guys have any thoughts - besides what an idiot I was?

Thanks!",5

16-01-21,41xrdu,Is it really that bad of an idea to diversify bond holdings globally?,"So, here's what I've learned about long term investing: diversification. Diversified investments reduces non-systemic risk (and therefore volatility), so, for example, in 2015, if I invested only in Canada, I would have been in the red for 10%, while a balanced portfolio is probably 0% (meaning no losses, and not too much [if any] gains).

But I kept hearing that if I diversify bond holdings globally, the currency risk is greater than the movement of bond prices and yields. Is this really the case? After all, it seems like currency can move a lot more than the expected return of a portfolio. For example, the Canadian dollar lost 16% against the US dollar, the Yuan lost 5%, EUR/USD also lost 10%, etc...or is that a very rare event that is not expected to happen? I know that bonds don't move very much. I mean to say that, currencies are seemingly just as volatile as stocks (especially in times of heightened volatility). In other words, if your home currency is appreciating strongly against all others, it is likely that it will erode a lot of the equities capital gains for your foreign holdings, since that's the case, isn't greater diversification still better--especially to protect yourself from the downsides of the bond market in your home country?",3

&amp;nbsp;

I'm a 24 year old making a good income and I want to start moving more money from my low interest savings &amp; checking accounts into the stock market.


I currently have 10K in savings and 15K in checking. I have an additional ~10K in various ETFs and am contributing $1K to my 401K monthly. Does it make sense to keep this much money sitting unused?  
&amp;nbsp;

My current portfolio: 

* 20 Shares VWO Emerging Markets: $570
* 10 Shares TSLA: $1990
* 50 Shares VTI Total Stock Market: $4700
* 10 Shares VBR Small Cap: $1000
* 25 Shares VXUS Total International Stock: $1000  
&amp;nbsp;

Is this a fairly well rounded portfolio? If not, where do you see issues? I'm comfortable sitting on these stocks for a long time as I understand the market will fluctuate, but I'd also be interested in taking significantly more risk than the average investor.
When investing more, would I generally want to increase the number of shares I own in these ETFs or does it make sense to buy other ETFs (such as Schwab or iShares) to diversify further?
Any feedback is greatly appreciated.",10

16-01-21,41xmbz,IMO this is not the bottom (yet),"Not enough fear: The majority of people are still confident that markets will always rise. Almost no one is saying you should sell, those who have money sitting on the side are still thinking about putting it in, not wanting to miss a big rally. A week ago there were analysts all over the news spouting ""this correction is done, now's a GREAT TIME TO BUY"".
  
VIX is not above 30 even with a 12% correction, the level is being sustained, not spiking as it has in past* bottoms. A little fear is there but no one wants to believe it. If I see VIX spike above 40-50 I could believe we might be at a bottom but not 27.    

At most big correction bottoms you will have a fight, for months, while bulls and bears hold the line. Sometimes during this struggle you will see a bottom multiple times. There is no need to jump in now if you are sitting it out, these things take a looonngggg time to reach bedrock. In 2001 it took ~3 years, in 2007 it took ~1.5 years. Even in 2011, which wasn't a full blown bear market, it took 3 months to hit bottom and then stayed there for 1-2 months.  
  
I'm not saying you should panic, but on the same note don't rush into it either, this is far from over. Maybe pull out on the next bounce if you are looking to retire in the next 5 years or so... Full disclosure, I'm 90% in cash since Aug 19th, but continuing to DCA into the market with my contributions.

Anyway, I just wanted to give everyone an update. I noted then that high optimism points tended to cluster and that has been the case this time around as well, with four of the last five trading days qualifying (1/14 was not). On average, a cluster has been about 4-5 individual days and the S&amp;P low has usually been about 1-3% down from the first high optimism point (*if it's been correct*). The S&amp;P closed today at 1859.33 or 1.6% down from 1890.28. Both the number of days in this cluster and how much the S&amp;P is down from the first point are already in line with their averages. We could have a couple more down days in this cluster where the S&amp;P closes around 1825-1835, but my model thinks a bounce is coming and soon.

Anyway, election year aside, this has been one interesting month so far.  I remember a New Year's call from a former, old co-worker, bidding farewell to 2010 and the ""most fucked up decade"" he'd ever seen.  Go figure.  To the point...

Oil's tanked (no pun intended).  While the Saudis have their reasons, others do too.  Russia can't shut down a bunch of their refineries because they're afraid that they won't be able to start them up again (from a blurb I heard on CBS a while ago), Iran is hurting enough for cash that they've caved into international nuclear demands, ISIS's profits are tanking as a result (in addition to the walled burning the US delivered to them recently), and anyone who relies on oil as their income source is most likely flexing their abs in preparation for a gut shot.

My first thoughts are that companies that have high fuel costs are going to be the first to show a positive result to this circumstance along with retailers who cater to lower income markets and certain sectors of the service industry.

My second thought is that oil companies' stocks (and their suppliers), in their immediate state, are probably a good buy as we can probably expect oil prices to pop back up within the next several years.

My third thought circles the conspiracy bowl; wondering if the developed Middle East is shitting bricks about ISIS and is driving down the price of oil to 'monopolize' them out... and to brake-check Iran (Persia), who has a habit of getting aggressive at times, throughout history.

My fourth thought is that restaurants are probably going to be an early indicator of retail results....

Sooooo.......  I guess my point is that I **don't** think that oil prices like these are here to stay.  I wondering where the bottom of the market really is.  I'm also wondering which sectors of the market are going to get the greatest short term and long term gains as a result.

My opinions are really just my opinions and really, I'm wondering what other people think.

16-01-21,41ysih,My Bullish Case for Apple and why I think they will beat estimates,"So I am going to try and make this short and sweet because it’s late, but this is my bullish case for Apple despite all of the criticism is has gotten lately.

&amp;nbsp;


We all know that Apple revenues rely heavily on iPhone sales with the sales making up approximately 68% of its total revenue (see website at bottom for confirmation).  We also know that the average selling price for the iPhones was raised in 1Q15 to $687 because of the company offering more options and dropping the lower memory phones.  There is some speculation that the new iPhone plan that Apple is offering will ultimately raise the ASP, but that is something to be explored later on down the road.  I have not found a document that would tell me exactly how many iPhones were sold in China, but we can make an educated guess using the website at the bottom again.  We know that China made up approximately 21.6% of the total revenue for 1Q15.  So this is the part where I take a little creative leap in my reasoning, but I assume that the China sales also closely correspond to the larger picture in that the China sales are skewed towards one product or another.  So if we take 68% of the Chinese revenue for 1Q15 that will give us approximately $10, 977.92 (in millions) revenue from iPhones sold in China. With an ASP of $687 that would mean approximately 15.98 million iPhones were sold in China during this quarter, which would be 21.47% of total iPhones sold.

&amp;nbsp;

From 1Q14 to 1Q15 revenue from China grew by 70%, can we expect the same kind of growth over this past year? I think that is highly unlikely as Apple broke into the market and then expanding rapidly across the major cities during this time. I do think it’s reasonable for Apple to see a 30% growth over this past year in 2015.  What would this mean for Apple’s flagship product?  Well a 30% growth of iPhones sold in this market would mean approximately 20.77 iPhones sold in China.  This would be just less than 5 million units sold the previous and would mean that without any growth in any other region that Apple would sell 79.4 million iPhones in 1Q16.  

&amp;nbsp;

I think it is unlikely that Apple would experience no growth anywhere else though.  Across the four other regions that Apple tracks; Americas, Europe, Japan, and the rest of Asia, they had an average YoY growth of 21%.  So if this growth holds steady and they experience the same YoY growth then we can expect the rest of the world to sell approximately 70.69 iPhones.  Which combined with the sales in China would be a total of 91.45 million iPhones sold in 1Q16, a 22.92% YoY growth in iPhone sales.  While this may seem an incredible amount let’s not forget that from 1Q14 to 1Q15 iPhone sales went from 51.02 million units to 74.4. million units, a 45% YoY increase.  So I believe that this number made be conservative.  But if we want to low ball growth and assume that the strength of the dollar, slow growth across the world, and other macro factors are weighing on the growth potential, then we can assume that China only grows by 25% and the rest of the world by 10% YoY. This would still give us approximately 19.98 million units sold in China and 64.26 million units sold in the rest of the world, giving us a total of 84.24 million units sold in 1Q16.

&amp;nbsp;

So this is my prediction for when Apple reports after the close of the market next Tuesday, they will have sold between 84.24 and 91.45 million iPhones for 1Q16.  With an ASP of $670, because of comps this will equal approximately 56,440 and 61,271 (in millions) in revenue.  If past ratios with revenue hold true from other products and the past then we can expect a total of 77,709 and 82,580 (in millions) which would equate to an EPS range of 3.17 to 3.37 diluted.  This is assuming that the net profit margin remains at a constant 24% which can be seen here:

&amp;nbsp;

 https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2015/01/27Apple-Reports-Record-First-Quarter-Results.html

&amp;nbsp;

The current analyst estimates are 3.24 EPS with revenue of 76,473.  This is right in the middle of my prediction, but despite all the negative news I believe that sales in China are going to be better than expected and that if there is a slow down or even negative YoY growth in iPhone sales then it won’t come about until 2Q16, in March.

16-01-21,421r4i,Fabric of Reality Torn When Entire Subreddit Discovered to Exist Wholly in Mind of Institutionalized Homosexual Autistic Savant,"**The Wall Street Bets Weekly Herald**

*Fabric of Reality Torn When Entire Subreddit Discovered to Exist Wholly in Mind of Institutionalized Homosexual Autistic Savant*

Bringing a whole new meaning to the term “Fake and Gay”, it has been determined that nearly all 32,000 users of the Wallsteetbets subreddit are in fact the mental playthings of Steryl Sobchak, a 28 year old homosexual autist living in a voluntary care center near Des Moines, Iowa. 

The revelation was made when Wallstreetbets came to the attention of Reddit administrators after noticing heavy spikes in traffic and subscriptions to the extremely offensive and disturbingly immature community. Upon further investigation, they found that each and every account had originated from the same IP address in Iowa.  After contacting the ISP, they were directed to the IT department of Young-Osten Life Org, a non-profit mental health clinic near Des Moines.  From there they were able to determine that the entirety of the subreddit's traffic was originating from thousands of incognito tabs spread across a mere 3 computers.

(When asked for an interview, the system administrator on duty replied “Steryl get the fuck out of here!  NURSE!”)

While possessing an incredible talent for timing market bottoms and tops, Steryl does not understand the concepts of profit and loss, preferring to drain his account to zero in the quickest way possible, because as we all know, big numbers are ugly. Nevertheless, this has proved quite fruitful for the staff at Young-Osten, who after learning of his ability began making the opposite of his trades and have earned tremendous amounts of money since.  

Due to the nature of Mr. Sobchak’s lucrative obsession, his caretakers have allowed him the use of the internet and computers, letting him trade with paper accounts across all exchanges and markets.  The unintended effect of this was enabling his virtual doll-play.  These online personas offer a fascinating look into the mind of an autistic savant, and they keep him entertained, leading Young-Osten staff to turn a blind eye to his games. 

One of the more prominent traits of Steryl’s online playhouse is the prevalence of dicks. Dicks in the header image, dicks in the posts, and dicks in the comments. While these are not concrete proof of his being gay, the doctors at Young-Osten have come to the conclusion after noticing his fanboy obsession with Martin Shkreli, the pharmaceutical CEO who infamously raised the price of Daraprim by over 3,000%. After learning about Shkreli he plastered every square inch of his room with pictures of the “pharma bro”, going so far as to order shirts with the callous ex-CEO’s image on the front. While Steryl denies his supposed sexuality, we can't stop thinking about dicks. Dicks dicks dicks! 

Amusingly, the only outsider that Steryl interacted with through Wallstreetbets was in fact Martin Shkreli himself. Steryl’s obsessive posts about the man finally drew his attention to the subreddit, where Steryl immediately made him a moderator. Shkreli began livestreaming for what he thought was thousands of users, unaware that they were all in fact one man in a dark room in Iowa, furiously masturbating as Shkreli played guitar riffs, which is of course the societally accepted way to express admiration for someone. 

Unfortunately Martin deleted some of Steryl’s playfully antagonistic comments, and Steryl was forced to ban him from the community. 

Steryl maintains a diverse group of digital personas, ranging from delusional French Canadians to highschoolers pretending to be adult traders and deviously fooling the rest of the ""community"" into buying terrible stocks. His favorite pastimes with the characters are to recreate the highschool drama which he sees regularly on his favorite Disney Channel shows, and antagonize other investment and trading subreddits when they point out the combined 53 IQ points Steryl distributes amongst his accounts. 

The incident which provoked Reddit admin attention and lead to the discovery was quite traumatizing for Steryl.  He accidentally bought put instead of call options on the market and turned one of his nearly zeroed out paper trading accounts into many thousands of fake dollars.  Angry with himself for such a foolish mistake, he began creating new Reddit accounts at a rapid pace, to flood the community with stupidity and lose more paper money.  Upon realizing he had been caught he was forced to close his subreddit for a brief period, until the unwelcome attention had passed.  Luckily this did not take long - Reddit administrators quickly lost interest with the investigation when they realized how disastrously moronic and self-absorbed all of his posts were, concluding that he would never have any substantial effect on absolutely anything of importance online.  

The most upsetting realization is that as Wallstreetbets subscribers, we must conclude that our entire reality exists in the mind of such a disturbed human being. This poses serious questions about what defines identity and self-awareness. Am I me?  Can I be anything if I do not exist?  What is I when there is no me?  You are me and I am you, but there is no you or me. They *do* think it be like it is, but how can they do if we do not be?

The paper analyzes policy changes previously made by the Social Security Administration (SSA) in regards to the Normal Retirement Age (NRA) and clarifies the impact of an NRA increase across both sex and race. The paper quantifies the NRA initiation decision based on age, sex and race. This is useful for coming retirees who have uncertainty of when to initiate, and importantly demonstrates the effect of sex and race when considering future NRA policy changes.

since they sell alot of cars it seems pretty volatile, but i think ford is headed in the right direction, compared to other automakers im not sure how the competition will translate to the stock price in the future.

Ferrari: I love ferraris, Strong brand, people will always want ferraris, i do not see them messing up or making any cars that people would not want to buy, BUT they do not want to sell too many ferraris to keep them limited and in demand, recent IPO as well also is swaying me away

XONE stock is so volatile because 50% of their revenue comes from 5-10 large clients. They lose one and its a big drop, they gain one and its a large increase. Considering the CEO just invested an additional 12 mil a few weeks ago I'm interested in holding for a little longer.

i'd like to invest in let's say RDS.b, XOM, VOW, HAL, OXY, etc. and let it sit there. Maybe 20.000 € total at most.

But with online brokers, they ''encourage'' you to make a minimum number of purchases per month /year. also if i want to hold for a couple of years, and the broker goes bust before that,...

16-01-21,422fq8,"YOLOing Nigeria: the case for frontier markets, emerging market's black sheep uncle","You've probably heard the phrase ""only pussies avoid emerging market stocks"". This is true. Stocks of more advanced (developed) nations of the world like the UK/Japan are more stable. The returns of developed market stocks swing between +/- 40% per year, fairly close to the +/- 35% of American stocks. Effete children like those at /r/Investing/ may enjoy these happy waters, but prospective emperors and tyrants must look elsewhere.

Enter emerging markets, returning from -50% to +75% per year. These second-world stocks (China, Russia, Brazil, etc) returned **+75%** for investors who came on board January 1, 2009! The closest that developed market stocks came to that is their +39% bump in 2003.

So yeah, only pussies avoid emerging markets. But did you know that there is an even more volatile corner of emerging markets, a place where few dare to tread, but which can offer its winners incredible wealth and power?

I'm talking about investing in the third-world through frontier markets, the emerging markets **of** the emerging markets. These are the least developed segments of the world that are still investable. Here be dragons.

Investing in frontier markets means getting into bed with countries like:

* Nigeria
* Pakistan
* Kenya
* Kuwait
* Argentina
* Kazakhstan

Do you know what sort of economy these countries operate? No joke, you are investing in life's three essentials: (1) national banks, (2) cell phone companies, and (3) breweries. Cash, text messages, and beer. Who needs anything else?

Want to invest in Nigerian Breweries, the national beer company of Nigeria (3% of the global frontier market)? Great idea! Even a coup d'état would keep those doors open.

Here's the reason why I'm dumping cash into frontier markets: emerging markets as a whole are an unbelievable buy right now, currently at a 10 year low. When they correct, you bet their gonna gap up 2X as much as the US or Europe. Frontier markets, as an extension of emerging markets, have even more potential. You're talking massive upside here. Basically, this is a one-every-10-years event for frontier markets. Things are about to get spicy.

There are two index funds that serve frontier markets: [iShares FM](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239649/ishares-msci-frontier-100-etf) and [Guggenheim FRN](http://guggenheiminvestments.com/products/etf/frn). While iShares FM is the more recognizable name, I actually prefer Guggenheim's FRN fund. It has a 15% cap per country, while iShares doesn't have this cap, so Kuwait sucks up 25% of the index as a whole (and isn't much of a frontier anyways). Overall, FRN is better balanced, keeping more of your invested cash with the cellphone magnate of Oman!

16-01-22,4266a3,[Research] $AAPL -- Thoughts on Management Change that Happened Dec 17.,"SORRY WSB I FOROGT THIS POST LAST MONTH
----
Apple announced management changes that we believe increase focus on operations management, semiconductor design, and the App Store. We see all of this as positive for the company.

•**New COO Jeff Williams:** Apple named Jeff Williams as its new COO. Jeff is currently the SVP of Operations, and, according to Apple, he has overseen Apple’s entire supply chain, service and support, and the social responsibility initiatives since 2010. Apple said that Jeff played a key role in the company’s entry into the mobile phone market with the launch of iPhone, and he continues to supervise development of Apple’s irst wearable product, Apple Watch. Note that Tim Cook had never backfilled himself as COO after taking the helm as CEO.


•**Johny Srouji named to the executive team:** Johny Srouji is SVP, Hardware Technologies and is responsible for leading Apple’s silicon efforts. Johny joined Apple in 2008 to lead development of the A4. Apple said that Mr. Sroji built silicon and technology engineers teams at Apple, overseeing custom silicon and hardware technologies including batteries, application processors, storage controllers, sensors silicon, display silicon and other chipsets across Apple’s entire product line. We see proprietary semiconductor design as a key element of the company’s ability to continue to differentiate its products in the future.


•**Phil Schiller takes over App Store:** Phil Schiller, SVP of Worldwide marketing, is expanding his role to App Stores across all platforms. Apple said that Phil now leads nearly all developer-related functions at Apple, in addition to his other marketing responsibilities, including Worldwide Product Marketing, international marketing, education and business marketing. The increased App Store focus is clearly needed, in our opinion, with recent criticisms of the Mac App Store in particular being at issue. We also believe the Apple TV App store offers significant potential and deserves additional management attention.


•**Tor Myhren named new VP of Marketing Communications:** Apple said Tor Myhren will join Apple in CQ1’16 as VP of Marketing Communications. Mr. Myhren will succeed Hiroki Asai, who plans to retire after 18 years in graphic design and marketing communications roles at Apple. Tor Myhren joins Apple from Grey Group, where

16-01-22,4267fp,"[RESEARCH] U.S. Autos &amp; Auto Parts -- Three things learned from Nov sales","**Nov. U.S. light vehicle SAAR came in at 18.19mn**, the second best monthly SAAR in
the past 10 years, and amongst one of the 10 best monthly SAAR results since 1980.
The print was slightly below our estimate and sell-side consensus of 18.3mn, but still
well ahead of the in-going trailing 6-mo/12-mo averages of 17.8/17.4mn, driven by
Black Friday promotions. Nov. SAAR was up 1.05mn units y/y, but down 50k
sequentially from Oct SAAR of 18.24mn (the current 10-year high). Results from
Toyota, Nissan, and Hyundai-Kia were better than expected, offsetting lower-thanexpected
sales from Ford, GM, and the non-J3 transplants (VW -16%, Daimler -12%).
Within the print we saw three key points:



**1. An upward sloping plateau, with little concern over peak.** By nearly any measure
SAAR (trailing 3-mo, 6–mo, or 12-mo) is at a 10-yr high, with 3-mo SAAR notably at a
robust 18.2mn. Continuing the strong momentum, we expect year-end promotional
activity to keep Dec SAAR in the high-17mn/low-18mn range. And despite growing
concerns that SAAR has peaked with imminent pressures from weaker residuals and
rising interest rates, we expect a plateau over the next two years, with 2016/17 sales of
17.8mn/17.6mn. As noted post our Global Autos Conference, sales should hold due to
a healthy consumer and supportive financing, with limited risk from rising rates (OEMs
to absorb initial rate increases with subvention) and lower residuals (steady declines).



**2. Pricing still a tale of two segments.** Amid increased concerns of weaker pricing, we
don’t think incentive spend has become unwieldy yet. Rather, mid-month incentive
data indicated pricing remains a tale of two segments. ATPs (pricing) in small/mid cars
remain soft (-2%/-3% respectively), with incentives higher and ATPs lower for nearly
all OEMs in mid cars. Conversely, pricing for light trucks remains strong – ATPs for
midsize SUVs are +4%, with incentives lower and ATPs higher for nearly all OEMs. We
expect these trends to continue through 2016.



**3. Large pickup competition to remain intense despite recent lull, yet opportunity**
remains from price/volume. Large pickup competition was at a lull in November, with
mid-month segment per-unit incentives down 3% y/y and 9% sequentially (albeit with
month-end incentives likely higher given Black Friday promotions). Amidst modestly
higher total segment sales growth, Ford F-Series was up 10%, with share sequentially
increasing to 36.5%, the highest level since January (at the expense of GM and Ram);
Ford benefited from increased F-150 fleet sales. And while we expect competition to reignite
in the coming months (especially as Ford continues to push for share), we expect
pricing to remain solid – mid-month ATPs (pricing) were robust (+6% y/y, +2%
sequentially) and at an all-time high. Overall, while competition may prevent Ford and
GM from realizing the same price tailwinds they saw earlier this year, continued price
strength and increased volumes may still yield healthy tailwinds for both OEMs in 4Q.

-----

My Take: The Auto industry has been the best performing industry the past 2Qs. Most likely due to higher miles driven per person = more replacement parts &amp; servicing, more chances of buying new cars. This is all due to low oil environment. We can expect a consumer vehicle prices to DECREASE (tiny bit) first half of next year, given current pricing on Iron and Oil derived products. ",9

16-01-21,41zyoo,Why I believe there is a social media / adtech bubble,"I don't have a deep knowledge of tech or stocks. But i do own a business, and I've never seen great results from the limited amount of (online) ads I've tested. Certainly they work in the right industries if deployed wisely. But from a macro view, i think paid advertising in general is overvalued. Before the internet, that was how you got the word out about a company (or anything). Now people can find whatever they want WHEN they want to search for it. Also, word of mouth is more widespread because of social media, which ironically devalues the overall importance of paid advertising. The prevailing thought is that companies like facebook are super valuable because they can target ads. Sure a targeted ad is better than an indiscriminately placed billboard, but i think the long term trend will favor actual creative promotional techniques (guerilla marketing, viral videos, giveaways, promotional events) that get ppls genuine attention vs paid ads. Especially, once you figure in the future of adblocking. Moreover, in an era of yelp, video reviews, etc; paid ad's are the worst method for a consumer to evaluate a company / potential purchase. Consumers know this, and are rightfully skeptical of ads.

With that said, obviously facebook and google both are producing large profits from advertising, so it's not as though I can advocate shorting them. They likely can go on like this for many years, for 2 reasons: A) Regardless of how overvalued online advertising is, it's surely more effective than offline overall. B) Due to ease of entry for even the smallest business + the ubiquitousness of the services, there's always more advertisers willing to give them a try.

In summary, the tech industry constantly touts ""disruption"" as reasoning to pump share prices in the expectation of future growth. The irony is that the internet itself has disrupted/undermined the value of the very revenue stream (advertising) these social networks depend upon to make money. Furthermore, they have no alternative revenue stream prospect(subscriptions) because even though half the world spends inordinate amount of time on these sites, 99% of users would quit them if they cost even $5 a month. If that's not a bubble, I don't know what is. The same could be said for the media/journalists who constantly bemoan adblocking for cutting into the viability of their careers. Once again, I suggest that their ""careers"" really aren't as valuable to society as they think. Sure they get a lot of eyeballs, but few people are willing to pay to read someone's ""blog"" regardless of what big name site it is posted on. Basically, there's a journalist bubble as well, because the internet is nothing if not a source of free opinions (reddit, twitter, etc). Do we really need to pay people to offer theirs anymore?

Once again, I don't know if there's a way to profit off this thesis, but it certainly makes me skeptical of being truly long on any adtech stocks.

Just some thoughts re: oil while watching the Davos coverage on CNBC..

1. Oversupply = price has to fall. Economics 101 right? Am I right to say that a follow-on effect would be that the industries that need to use oil regardless in their production, eg automobile, aviation, just off the top of my head would be buying all at a 'discount', ie somehow = cheaper goods, and therefore it's a buyers market for such goods, therefore it should drive the economy up?

I know it's a very grossly simplified outlook, but it appears in my head that this current slump should correct itself on principle. Am I thinking it correctly?

Therefore, short of a cataclysmic event like war, with the lifting of sanctions on Iranian oil, prices should stabilise around the $20-$25 mark for the time being..?",0

16-01-21,4202bg,Trying to avoid Insider Trading,"So Im trying to get some better clarification on purchasing stock. After reading the SEC's description of Insider Trading and apply it to my situation, I was left with more questions than answers. It then at the bottom of the page says, ""If further questions... yadda yadda... consult a lawyer who specializes in securities trading law"" Well, they are the authority on the issue, it seems like they should be the ones to make these questions clear, not me having to pay a lawyer to answer these questions, or worry of prosecution.

Anyways, here is the scenario:

I work for a company that is under contract for another company. I work in a department that is far removed from any information from the client company. An analogy would be about the equivalent of me working as a janitor for a company who is hired by a company that manufactures airplanes. They are a small company who plans on becoming a major player. The extent of my knowledge is this company is small, publicly traded compared to the larger companies. They dont involve me, or my department with their company direction other than, they plan to make money manufacturing airplanes...

So, when can I purchase stocks in a small company that has potential to make it big?

My fear is it seems clear to me that there is a far enough degree of separation to not violate insider trading, however, ignorance doesn't constitute a defense.

Any help would be great, and I would be open to describe in more accurate detail provided someone asks privately",20

16-01-22,426joo,"Oil skyrockets 21% in 48 hours, nears $32","Oil prices spiked 7% to $31.85 a barrel on Friday. It represents a dramatic rebound from Wednesday, when crude crashed to as low as $26.19 a barrel, the weakest level since April 2003. That's a remarkable 21% surge in the span of just two days.

The rally gathered momentum on Thursday when oil prices rose 4.2%, the biggest one-day percentage gain since October 28.

All of this is great news for the stock market, which has been intensely focused on the price of crude oil. The Dow jumped more than 200 points on Friday morning, with energy stocks leading the market higher. Shares of BP (BP) and ExxonMobil (XOM) posted solid gains, while smaller Williams Companies (WMB) spiked 16%.

However, Newsom said the fundamental backdrop remains very bearish for oil. The world simply has too much oil, especially given lackluster demand growth due to the slowdown in China

Assuming the reports are correct, Uber grew its losses faster than its net revenues between 2014 and the first three quarters of 2015. Revenues were up 134%, to $1.161 billion, while losses grew 151%, to $1.684 billion. This was also the case between Q1 and Q2 2015, although it was reversed between Q2 and Q3 2015. (Net revenues are what the company keeps after paying fees to drivers. Gross revenues, or bookings, are much higher.)

The takeaway? Uber is still in expansion mode. The company and its investors are betting that ride-sharing is a winner-take-all or winner-take-most market, and are willing to spend billions to fuel expansion in hopes that an eventual near monopoly will reap great returns.

That's how it seems to have worked for Amazon, although as Bloomberg pointed out, Amazon lost $1.4 billion on $2.8 billion in revenue in its worst quarter ever in early 2000, and Jeff Bezos cut staff by 15% as a result. ",1

16-01-22,426q8g,DD on DISNEY (DIS),"Fundamentally, Disney is a great company to go long. Right now it's trading 96-97 (1/22/16) which is dirt cheap at its present valuations. 

What analysts on the Street are afraid of is ESPN. It's ratings are low and it's a costly part of Disney's business.

Anyways I'm using a model from 3Q but the upside argument for Disney will come from business segment synergies and how their movie (Star Wars and Marvel) transition into higher parks/resorts/commercial goods revenue. The problem is the synergies are hard to model but the theory is there.

Disney's earnings in two weeks will be a strong tell tale sign of how the company is doing. A strong focus for investors will be ESPN and expectations will be how costs have faded. In the pipeline is the Shanghai Resort opening in June which will be a huge boost to Disney. 

I'm guessing there's going to be slight recovery in these next two weeks leading up to earnings. Most people won't buy too much until after earnings to see where the company is heading.

Looking at those more closely, it's made up of about 10 percent bonds. So here's my question:
We're not planning to retire until the 2045-2050 range. Obviously it makes sense to gradually shift toward more bonds as you get closer to that date (for stability), but we're 30+ years out. 

So let's say we want to start switching to more bonds about 10 years before retirement... that still leaves 20 years where it seems like pure stocks would be the smarter play. Has there ever been a 20-year stretch where you're better off in bonds? 

Take the WORST possible time to invest in stocks the past 80 years - the days leading up to the financial crisis. Even with that crash (and taking into account the current China freakout), stocks are still providing slightly better returns:
http://stockchoker.com/compare/?s=VTSAX&amp;t=VBTLX&amp;d=20071005&amp;a=10000

So to my ultimate question: 
Is a 9:1 stock-to-bond ratio wise for money that won't be touched for at least 20 years or would 100-percent stocks be the smarter move? If it's the latter, why does Vanguard do the 9:1 ratio - to prevent really ugly losses in the short-term?",17

Also I never play just technicals.  Blizzard makes games that people fucking love.  Heartstone is a cash cow and E-Sports is going to continue to get larger this year.

Not important for this earnings but solid info for if earnings happens to be a miss.  I'm comfortable holding long if needed.

If you pay off a credit card where you are paying a 10 percent interest, that will be the equivalent of earning a 10 percent rate of return on the same amount of money invested in another asset.

But it's even better. The return that you will earn on paying off debt will not have income tax consequences. Therefore, paying off debt can produce superior returns to most other investments. And that return is guaranteed and completely risk-free. If you have debt, this should be your first ""alternative investment.""",0

16-01-22,423rtv,Dollar Cost Averaging and commission costs,"Greetings fellow investors,

I'm new to investing. I have a good amount in a Roth IRA account and I've been reading about investment strategies. I have developed an excel doc showing what industries I want to invest in, the amount of my portfolio I want to dedicate to each asset class, and the specific stocks/mutual funds I want to invest in. 

I know my own limitations and knowledge level so I am thinking about using Dollar Cost Averaging. I have a few questions.

Let's say I decide to put away X dollars per month for investment. What is the best way to use dollar cost averaging while not losing too much in commission costs on trades? If I understand the concept correctly, I'll be reinvesting a lump sum once or twice a month. Should I be putting that entire lump sum into one stock at a time or dividing it among one or two (or more) stocks? If I did it twice a month, that would be $192 a year in commission costs. While not an exorbitant amount, I don't think I would enjoy the feeling of being limited in the amount I could allocate to each asset class. 

Additionally, how to a re-invest my dividends as efficiently as possible? Every time I reinvest my dividend into a stock, I'll be losing a good chuck of money just off the commission alone.

Is DCA most effective when investing in mutual funds?

I am determined to make that money back, however, I'm unwilling to risk my principal. So, no options. 

My plans are to buy 1,150 shares of Visa going into earnings on the 28th, using all of the money I can scrape up. I am aiming to make away with at least a total gain of $2,400, dividends included. 

Visa closed today at $71.52. I got $83,000, so depending on price action tomorrow, I could get a couple more or a couple less shares than the 1,150 I'm aiming to buy. 

Visa has always paid a dividend in mid-February, which is declared when earnings are announced. If I get 1150 shares, then my dividend payment will be $161. So, minus this dividend, all I need is a gain of $2,239. Using the current price, I would need a gain of 2.72% on top of the most recent closing price to achieve my goal.

So, what do you guys think? I know I'm a pussy for not playing call options, but I don't want to risk my principal and if push really comes to shove and V falls on earnings, I can sit on this for a little while until it reaches my gain percentage target. I don't know enough about options to play the possibility that shares could fall or gain. But I think shares will likely gain. 

If things go my way... I'll sell V at a good price and never gamble ever again and go back to investing in undervalued shit or whatever Warren Buffett says to do.",70

16-01-22,42817i,Using Robin Hood,"So a couple of question, I am a new trader and just started. During sign up on the app when it asked me for citizenship I put in my country that I am still a citizen of because I only came to America 7 years ago, and only have a green card. We just haven't applied for the passport yet. But I put in Bangladesh and it didnt have any options like TD Ameritrade did where I can put that I have a green card. Hopefully everything goes ok with that. 


Now I was using Ameritrade and made some investments, but the commission fee killed me. Like I made a couple dollars of profit from penny stocks but I cant even sell to make a positive profit because of those commission fees. So I look forward to using Robin Hood. I also recently invested in Tesla bought 4 shares (majority of my money went on that and I have like $30 left on my account). 


So my questions would be, any advice? Anything wrong with the sign up process that I did with RobinHood? Does Tesla look good? 

Any advice will help. ",2

16-01-23,429vaa,Should I bother with my HSA?,"So, I just got set up with an HSA and my employer contributes $500 per year.  This year only they're giving a $250 bonus contribution, which puts me at $750.  By default the fund is in some kind of bank savings account making... 0.28% interest.  Of course, I could do better even with the relatively crummy options they have available to me.  I decided on putting everything into VSMAX since it's really the best thing they have.  I would normally stick it in the SP500 index option, but the one available has a ridiculous .36% ER.

HOWEVER, when I tried to change funds, the website notified me the HSA balance must be at least $1000 in order to invest it.  That is, $1000 total - not the same as a fund minimum.

I am a relatively healthy 20 something year old.  My spending on healthcare last year was $0, and will probably be the same this year.  I am aware of the qualified expense loophole where you could save your receipts from multiple years, but I don't feel confident that it will be left unfixed for too much longer.

My question is:  is it worthwhile to lock $250 of my own money into an HSA with crappy funds so that I'm able to invest, or should I just wait a year longer to get $500 more?",9

16-01-22,4283oc,"Today was driven by an increase in the short loan rebates. Basically, shorting became too expensive heading into the weekend.","uhhh..stock loan fees...not rebate

Finviz has this bubbles feature that lets you plot all US listed stocks on 2 variables. 

I made [this bubble chart](http://finviz.com/bubbles.ashx?x=shortInterestShare&amp;y=gap&amp;size=const&amp;color=sector&amp;idx=any&amp;sec=healthcare&amp;cap=midover&amp;rangeX=5.049019607843138%7C35) with the 'Gap Up' for each stock today and the short interest ratio(days to cover). 

I have it filtered on stocks &gt;$2 Billion and Days to cover more than 5 days (what finviz considers high) and within the healthcare sector. 

Even though there isn't a trend line feature, the pattern is pretty clear; **higher short ratios, meant higher gap ups today,; regardless of size, sector, performance or any other metric I can use**

I can't think of a reason other than that the short loan fee ~~rebate~~ increased too much for shorting to make sense. This bears out is you look at stocks that had under 5 days of short interest, they tended to have a [more random move starting out](http://finviz.com/bubbles.ashx?x=shortInterestShare&amp;y=gap&amp;size=const&amp;color=sector&amp;idx=any&amp;sec=healthcare&amp;cap=midover&amp;rangeX=0%7C5.049019607843138). Because nothing changed at a fundamental level.

edit: a further point of evidence. For companies with a big sticker price (eg: priceline), even a 'low' short ratio resulted in a  big jump up. Again, this would be because even a small ratio of a big sticker stock costs more absolute $$ when the cost of borrowing the stock rises

edit 2: if someone has a better system at hand (bloomberg), this is what you should see for todays move. 

1. Stocks with less than 5 days of short interest and an average or below average nominal price participated the least in todays rally.

2. Stocks with less than 5 days of short interest but with large nominal prices had larger moves

3. Stocks with greater than 5 days of short interest moved more than those in cat 2.

4. stocks with high nominal prices and more than 5 days of short interest moved the most (barring takeovers or penny stock moves)",37

16-01-22,424a89,Noobs get in here if you actually want to learn how to make money,"Before you go buying long calls and puts trying to guess which way the market will go based off all kinds of fancy lines and indicators read this shit. Past price does not predict future price, price direction in the short term is random. So if we can't predict the direction how can we make money? By predicting randomness. Randomness or volatility will always revert from periods of high volatility back to the mean level of low volatility. And if you know anything about options, you should know that the more volatility there is the more expensive options are. So what we can do to make money is sell options when volatility is high because they are more expensive, then buy them back, when volatility reverts back to the mean and theta decay sets in, for cheaper than we sold them.

(*I'm not responsible if you blow up your account)

Step 1: Acquire capital (takes money to make money)

Step 2: Open brokerage account at discount broker (optionshouse, interactive brokers, etc.)

Step 3: Put 20-50% percent of your money into solid stocks, to help sustain your account through draw downs and shitty markets

Some stock ideas (do your own DD bro):
MO, RAI, PM - Cigarette Companies: got them fat cash flows, repeat customers, potential play on increasing e-cig market, MO and RAI currently own about 25% of e-cig market

SCI, CSV, MATW, HI, STON - Funeral Homes: People don't stop dying = guaranteed customers, CDC predicts US deaths to increase 1% a year up to 2025

ERI - Eldorado Resorts: gambling play, once again playing off peoples addictions

DIS - Analysts are fukin dumb: ESPN losses overestimated, star wars is gonna blow out earnings, highest grossing movie, most valuable toy franchise of 2015, star wars battlefront licensing, Campbell's soup even licenses star wars to put on their cans

Step 4: Use remaining cash to trade options

How to trade index options(SPY,QQQ,IWN,TLT,GLD,EWW,EWX,XLU,XLE,etc.): 
If implied vol percentile is greater than 65 sell an iron condor spread with about 1 to 1 and 1/2 month expiration, make width of the iron condor 1 standard deviation, and the wings 2 standard deviations apart.  Buy back the iron condor when it has reached 25-50% of profit, don't wait for it to expire.

How to play earnings(any company with liquid options):
Repeat the process for index options but only enter the position at around 3:00pm EST the day before earnings, and make sure to buy the contracts with the closest expiration. When the market opens after earnings wait about 15-30 min to allow volatility to collapse then cash out if you are ITM. If you're OTM close it out if you don't know how to adjust and roll options.

As you may already know, Crude is at $30.86 (+4.49%) up ~10% from yesterday's early ~$27.

I can't figure out why this is happening.

1. OPEC and others have shown no interest in reducing supply.

2. Nothing particularly special regarding growth in China.

3. Supply in America continues to grow.

4. Iran apparently plans to be very competitive in oil production and price.

5. Some people say that some recent attack/s on oil facilities made by terrorist groups in some barely relevant Middle Eastern countries have helped oil rally, but I don't think these attacks are significant as, well, not much oil was lost, and even if, the main points above are still true.

I covered my shorts/puts after the inventory report as oil started to rally and I don't understand why. I would like to continue to have bearish positions in oil but I don't like to enter positions that I do not understand.

So, can someone help me and probably many others by answering the question, ""Why is oil rallying""?

16-01-23,428o6z,"Hey there, I'm not an investor, not into finance, just confused about what ""shorting a stock"" means. Here is my ELI5 explanation of it, but I'm stuck on something.","Sorry if this is a simple concept for you guys, it's just I hear this term so much and only took the time today to fully try to understand. Here is my question with my ELI5 scenario:  
      

Here's how I've come to understand what ""shorting a stock"" means. It's like me going over to my friend Dan's house and borrowing his XBOX. The XBOX is $500. As soon as I have Dan's XBOX, I sell it and make a profit of $500.
   
   



My current situation is as follows:
- I owe Dan an XBOX 
- I have $500 in my pocket
     
   

 


*^\(Now ^if ^the ^price ^of ^the ^XBOX ^went ^up, ^say, ^to ^$750, ^then ^I'm ^screwed....I ^now ^have ^to ^take ^the ^$500 ^I ^made ^and ^$250 ^out ^of ^my ^own ^pocket ^and ^buy ^Dan ^an ^XBOX. ^Let's ^assume ^that ^the ^price ^did ^not ^go ^up.)*


Let's say 3 months later, the price of an XBOX is $250. I go out and buy one, and give it to Dan. My profit is now $250. Since Dan let me borrow his XBOX for so long, I give him a fee of $50. 

All in all, life is good, I made $200 in total.




My question is this, why would Dan ever let me borrow his XBOX to begin with?  Does Dan just believe the price will go up? ",11

16-01-24,42etsk,Share Splitting Technical Questions,"Most major corporations at one time or another, have split their shares in the interest of attracting more ""average and low income investors.""

Ultimately, this tactic results in a decrease in price and an increase in demand for the stock.

From my understanding,  the current ""Ask"" price is trading at too high of a level for the average consumer to afford.
For example, the average consumer would be very reluctant to purchase AAPL at $700 a share (2012). After AAPL implemented their 7/1 split, more casual investors were able to afford equity at $100 a share (2016). This resulted in linear market-share volatility.

My Question: For companies that decide to implement tactical stock splits, does this give a good indication that the corporation ""should"" expect a decent quarter? My professor said that this is ""mostly"" true, but you can never be %100 sure. He claims that there's a psychological element involved. If a company had split its stock and then proceeded to have a poor quarter, investors would become fearful, distraught and skeptical of the companies future.

I was hoping that someone could shine light and spread further insight on this topic.
What are your oppinions? Do Stock Splits predict better than average quarters?

First off, Hello. I currently teach an extra class for High School students, related to stocks. Basically I have my students paper trade via online accounts. 


It goes by the semester system, and last semester was my first time teaching the class. The little shitheads had one job, to trade twice a week for at least six weeks (I believe they had a total of 10 weeks)


In my previous class, one group out of 73 actually fulfilled this requirement and traded twice a week for seven weeks. Due to awful results I am on probation. If my next class doesn't do well, I am out of a job. I am going to teach another class starting this Friday, the 29th. How the fuck can I get the kids to learn? What stocks should I tell them about? I honestly know jack shit besides the stuff we circlejerk here on WSB. 


I told my a the majority of my students last semester to look at stocks like Tesla. Due to that, my WHOLE FUCKING CLASS ended up getting below average. Portfolios start at $100k, and like a tenth of them managed to keep 100K or go slightly over. And thats cause most of them didn't trade. I'm such a shitty teacher.


What the fuck do you think I should tell my students this time? Things are pretty cheap I'm happy about that. I don't think I can go wrong this time, cause if they start off profiting they pretty much will enjoy doing it. I want them to LIKE IT. This time around I wanna tell the little shitheads about yoloing and not giving a fuck honestly fuck principles.


also heres my proof so you guys can go fuck yourself

My question is: when do you think rates will start to rise for savings products like online savings accounts and CDs?  Is it simply a matter of competition; when one bank raises the rate to get business the others follow to retain business?  For those who have been around a while, when does this tend to happen?  I haven't seen rates rise for savings products at all yet.

The reason I ask is because I'd like to open some CDs, but obviously would prefer to wait until the rate hike flows into savings products.

edit: I current have my cash/emergency fund in an online savings account at Barclays earning 1%.  I'm looking at the Barclays 5 year online CD which has a rate of 2.25%.  The early withdrawal penalty on the CD is 180 days worth of interest.  So even if I only keep the cash in the CD for 1 year, I would beat the return from the savings account (I'd get about 1.125%).  I don't plan to withdraw the cash unless I get laid off, which is the primary point of the account.  However it would suck to buy the 5 year CD and then see the rate jump the month after, so that's why I'm asking!",24

16-01-23,42c0cm,Oil Industry Panics as Chinese and Canadians Announce Joint Deal to Manufacture a New Oil Knockoff Called “Oir”,"**The Wall Street Bets Weekly Herald**

The oil industry has been sent scrambling for cover this weekend after the Chinese and Canadian governments announced their soon to be released oil substitute, “Oir”, during a press conference held early Saturday morning in Ottawa by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Chinese Premiere Li Keqiang.

“It is a great day for Canada, and it is a great day for China” said Trudeau. “We expect Oir to reinvigorate both of our nation's economies, as the low-cost production allows for us to sell at the extremely affordable price of $4 per standard barrel while still turning a substantial profit”.

The partnership can only be described as a match made in heaven, as the two country’s unique industrial strengths form the perfect combination of production capabilities allowing for Oir to be produced.  

“This revolutionary new product went into development eight months ago, with both country's top scientists working around the clock to bring it to production” Trudeau revealed. “Canada knew then as we know now that price of oil was going to drop substantially for the next few years, and decided to take preemptive action to cement our great nation's place in the global economy.”

Canadian microbiologist Charlie Abootman explained the process which led to Oir’s conception.  “We began with a benchmark, West Texas Intermediate Light Sweet Crude, and asked ourselves - what is similar to it, yet easier to make?  Well, the answer is obvious.  Maple syrup!  It’s sweet, light in color, and most importantly, an entirely renewable resource.  Once we had the basic concept down, we turned to the world’s expert in creating &amp; selling products similar to existing ones, yet with much less effort and cost - China!”

Chinese engineer Xihang Chen then took the stage to describe exactly what Oir is and how it is produced.  

“We begin with raw maple syrup, and ferment it to introduce combustibility to the product. After that we add vegetable oil based E153 black food coloring to the syrup, to further replicate WTI light sweet crude’s properties.”

When asked if Oir has been further refined into gasoline yet, Chen hurriedly whispered to his Canadian counterpart before stepping away.  

“Out of consideration for the world’s oil industry” explained Abootman, “we have chosen to limit our side of production to crude Oir.  I have been assured that current refineries will be able to easily process Oir to create a near identical substitute for gasoline- and while our countries hold a joint patent for this “Gasorine”, we will not be charging any licensing or royalty fees for it”.  

Trudeau then ran the podium to excitedly share one final feature of Oir. 

“The best part is that it's *edible!*  And *alcoholic!*  So if you prefer pancakes that pack a punch, we’re delighted to say that crude Oir will be coming to grocery stores worldwide in quart and gallon sized containers. Pretty cool, eh?” 

When asked if he had any comments to make, Premiere Kequiang merely said “Suck my balls, Rouhani. It's too late to pull out of the trade deal now!""

16-01-23,42co91,Thoughts on Mosaic (NYSE:MOS)?,"Recently I've been trying to get into investing in individual stocks, particularly from a value perspective, and Mosaic is one I saw on a stock screen that looks like it has some potential. But again, I'm new to this, so I just wanted to double-check that I'm not missing anything.

Finviz is telling me that:
 
* Its P/E is 7.25 with a forward P/E of 8.91, a P/B of 0.88 and P/FCF (free cash flow) of 12.03. 

* Its ROA is 6.8%, ROE is 11.8%, and ROI is 7.8%. 
 
* Its debt/equity is 0.4. 

* It has 87.6% institutional ownership (and the big institutions have access to data we don't.)

* Its quick ratio is 1.4 and its current ratio is 2.3.

* It has a 4.61% dividend yield with only a 31.7% payout ratio.

AFAIK these are all very good signs. However, it's trading near its 52-wk low, and as far as I can tell from my research this is because of dropping potash prices (they are America's biggest potash producer according to Wikipedia) and because they faced a $1.8b lawsuit for not properly handling the waste created by their mines in Florida and Louisiana ([source](http://www.nola.com/environment/index.ssf/2015/10/mosaic_agrees_to_18_billion_se.html)). 

Despite all this, the company seems to be running healthily in other ways according to the numbers, given their low debt, good return on assets, investments, and equity, low P/FCF, and high current and quick ratios. They are the biggest potash and fertilizer manufacturer in the US, and wide-scale agriculture is hardly disappearing any time soon. And the dividend can hardly be ignored.

I try to look at the recent movement of the stock to make sure I don't prematurely bail due to normal movement.

I got burned during the flash crash by dumping AAPL at $95 right before it went back up to $120 (although it later panned out because I'm not buying it at it's current price anyway) so I moved over to stop limits to avoid flash crash selling.  

I own Walmart without a stop loss/limit because I have enough confidence in that stock to buy more on a big dip, but most other stocks I own have stop limits on.

I've heard stop limits just guarantee a loss but I also don't like 80%+ losses when a 15% would be better.  ",7

&gt; In an unusual turn, I’m not writing today to suggest a few playlists we’ve hand-picked for you (though I've slipped a few in at the end of this email). Instead, I’m writing about potentially investing in 8tracks. 

&gt; Under US law, only wealthy individuals and venture capitalists have historically had the ability to invest in startups. This changed last summer: the JOBS Act now allows anyone to invest in private companies. Unlike typical crowdfunding platforms (like Kickstarter), this new process would allow you to actually own stock in 8tracks. 

&gt; 8tracks was founded to showcase the passion and talent of people who care about great music and wish to share it, delivering the perfect playlist for a listener’s taste, time and place. As our DJs and listeners have both created and promoted this infinite soundtrack, so too should they have the opportunity to finance it by taking a stake in the company while we’re still relatively small. 

&gt; New funding would allow us to build out a full music library for DJs, make it easier for listeners to find playlists they like, integrate 8tracks on new platforms, and refine our business model to continue to grow 8tracks for years to come. 

&gt; This isn’t an offer to invest, and as of now you still can’t buy shares. I’d simply like to understand if you would be interested in participating. If there’s broad interest, we may file official paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to pursue this new crowdfunding option.

I've done my research, particularly into deep-value investing, and now have a somewhat reasonable idea of what makes a company healthy or undervalued. 

Given the recent plummets in oil prices, I'm sure there are some great value opportunities to be had in oil, and I'd like to invest in about 2-3 good oil companies for the long-term, maybe putting some yolobux into a riskier play too. Problem is, not many oil companies are fundamentally healthy right now, with low current and quick ratios, as well as very low cash flow. As such, I can't invest in the intuitive deep-value fashion: buying healthy and profitable companies that have been inefficiently or unfairly priced. I must take a different approach.

However, when I went to my local TD branch this afternoon I was told I had to be 19 because the age of majority is 19 in my province (BC). This seems highly unfair considering that if I lived in neighbouring Alberta, or anywhere else in Canada except the Maritimes for that matter, I would be able to open my TFSA and get a head start on investing! I considered opening a QuestTrade account instead and entering my address as my cousin's address in Quebec, where the age of majority is 18, but I'm a bit worried about the legal implications of doing so. Anyway, my question is: Has anyone been in this same situation and were you able to circumvent the age of majority restrictions in your jurisdiction and if yes then how? Or am I screwed and am I just going to have to wait another year while my peers get a head start in the market?

TL;DR I'm 18 so I am eligible to open a TFSA but was told I could not because I am not the age of majority in my province (BC). Was wondering if anyone knew how I could get around this. ",2

I've always been one to believe that best way to know you have a good profile is that you are able to defend your positions when people are bashing them. So, can I please have you guys do your best to try and make me look like a complete fool? I'll list the stocks, percentage of profile, and a blurb on why I like the company.

1) WDR- 9.27%: Mutual fund that has been rated as a top 5 fund by Barrons for the last 5 years.  6.8% dividend, priced at 7.5x FCF when it historically trades at 18x, and with the stock down 70% from all time highs in 2014, there is plenty of opportunity to get back there.

2) IRBT - 9.38%: Robotics stock that currently has no debt and has been growing revenues, free cash, and profits consistently over the past 5 years. I go into this a bit more in detail in the following thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3knn6h/any_new_companies_that_anyone_sees_can_be_the_new/

3): FSLR -  5.81%:  Yeah, I know solar is kind of a meme, but this one has had growing profits, a positive free cash flow, limited debt that will allow it to expand when necessary, and with the growing amount of G-20 talks concerning climate change, if anything comes to fruition from there and we get more stringent regulations concerning carbon emissions, this company will benefit.

4) NSU - 7.37%: This is my Ben Graham stock; no debt, cash per share that is equal to 88% of the stocks value, pays a 6.5% dividend, and has positve net income and free cash flow in each of the last 2 years. Although this stock is in a hurting field, (copper &amp; zinc mining) its lack of leverage and base valuation make it tempting.

5) TNH - 7.60%: 10% dividend yield, no debt, extremly efficient with their assets (78% ROA), fairly cheap (6.4x FCF), and in a stable industry (fertlizer) that will benefit from growing populations in Africa, Asia, and India (subcontinent) who wish to be to increase their farming output.

6) WHG - 6.68%: Dividend of 4.8% for a REIT isn't the greatest, but no debt and consistent revenue and earnings growth of 14 and 19% a year respectively has WHG barely edge out STWD as far as a REIT in my funds.  

7) KINS - 7.57%: Revenues has doubled from 2012 to 2015 and profits have increased from .77MM to 5.33MM during the same period.  A company that is growing this fast, is priced at 8 times earnings, offers a 2.7% dividend, and has ample opportunities to grow as it only offers it insurance in the northeast US looks promising.

8) GILD - 8.92%: Extremely profitable, revenue growth of 40%, trades at 8.2 times earnings (an all time low), and with America's aging population, this company seems extremly cheap for the value.   

9) GOOG - 7.05%: Yeah, I know the stock may be a little pricey at current valuations, but with the addition of Ruth Porat to the triumvirate of tech (Schmidt, Page, and Brin), as well as Alphabet's commitment to stay ahead of the tech curve through Google Ventures, there is too much potential for me to ignore this company.  I'm thinking in 20 years, Alphabet will be known more by the projects that come from Ventures than from the search engine that started it all. 

10) SWKS - 5.86%: No debt, growing much quicker and efficiently than its peers in semis. I'm a bit concerned because it's a stock that has been really popular on Reddit, and I've seen how those go...

11) CASH - 24.49%: I'm not too confident in the market, so I'm keeping a large cash position in order to pick up any sales in the near future.  I'm feeling that the recent performance in the last two days has been a relief rally, and soon we will see a continue in the correction. Currently looking into CBD, GBX, CENX, AMGN, and GLP as potential addition if breadth starts to strengthen, but I'm not thinking it will anytime soon. I'm thinking of selling GOOG as I feel that I'm getting greedy considering current market conditions, and replacing it with 50% CENX and 50% AMGN. 

So please now try and destroy my profile in anyway you can. What stocks would you place in lieu of my positions?  Which stocks that I own are broken records, and what assumptions behind the companies are false/misleading? Is there a stock that you know of that would outperform?

16-01-24,42gshv,Advice on company and stock analysis.,"Hello. I'm sorry if this post is poorly formatted as this is my first post.

I'm currently very new to the world of stocks and business  but have done some general reading and understand the basics. I'm a first year med student that is interested in eventually getting into trading and investing. (Read: currently close to broke student)

I used to play holdem to a good degree of success and it is in part funding my education. However with school being way more demanding now then in undergrad I find myself with a lot less free time to pursue  the various hobbies I had before and I feel that looking into stocks and investments will be a fun replacement for the time being. (I have already found what I have read to be extremely interesting!)

When reading up on investment strategies, it was mentioned many times that successful analysts look at balance sheets, bottom line earnings etc etc. My question to this sub is where do I go to find this info, and where can I go to read something that will teach me how to utilize this info?

I know people spend entire careers and degrees learning these things but if 5 year of higher education has taught me anything, its that literally anything can be learnt from the internet.

Thanks for taking the time to read my question and I apologize for any reddiquettes I may have broken.


Edit: I should also note that I have read the various wiki for new investors links but they seem to be very broad stroke advice. I was hoping for a nudge to something more in depth. For example where to find MD&amp;A and how to break them down and understand them rather than just what they are.",6

16-01-25,42ky7j,Stock Analysis - Nvidia,"I'll be upfront with you, I am not the best at analyzing stocks.  I've created a blog in which I'm exploring stock analysis and try to do a write up of a stock everyday.  It's basically a self improvement stock to see how much I can improve.  I also try to go through a new thing everyday and explain it, today was CCI.  

The formatting is a little weird on reddit, howver if you want to check out the blog you can see it [here](http://www.dailyspin.io/2016/01/25/nvidia/), however the text is all posted below.  Thanks for taking the time and if you have any feedback its much appreciated!

**The Facts**

**P/E:** 26.59

**EPS:** 1.07

**Beta:** 0.81

**Market Cap:** 15.31B

**52w High/Low:** 18.94 – 33.94

**Fundamental Analysis**

Quick run through of the numbers, P/E is in the mid 20’s which I believe is a good sign, positive EPS and a little on the less risky side.  More towards our 52w high then low however I wouldn’t really consider that a factor.  Although not listed, the forward P/E is 20 which is a good sign, remember we want our forward P/E to be lower then our current P/E.  The Nvidia profit margin is 12% which is lower then we like to see, and comparing that to Intel’s 20% profit margin, still not looking great.

Net income has been up and down from quarter to quarter which is a little troublesome, however their previous was the highest in the past 4 quarters.  The balance sheet shows little to no growth over the past year and cash flow is also all over the place from quarter to quarter.

Too many factors here lead me to believe this is not a great buy.

**Consensus:** Don’t buy

**Technical Analysis**

SMA and EMA are both trending down on our 1 year chart above and the stock itself had a huge jump the second half of 2015.  Volume plays a role to see if the stock has any unusual change in movement, however it seems to be at its average trading volume and nothing specific jumps out.

Commodity Channel Index (CCI)

I’m going to leave the CCI explanation to the experts at StockCharts:

CCI measures the current price level relative to an average price level over a given period of time. CCI is relatively high when prices are far above their average. CCI is relatively low when prices are far below their average. In this manner, CCI can be used to identify overbought and oversold levels.
In Nvidia’s case, we can see CCI was low but now in the average range.
Consensus:  Don’t Buy

**Nvidia Conclusion**

While I am a fan of Nvidia products and consider them high end, I am not currently a fan of the Nvidia stock.  With a volatile market, a niche good, and some decent competition, I would avoid this for the time being and wait until the stock drops some more before considering jumping in.",11
16-01-24,42h4t9,"Finished reading ""The Intelligent Investor"". Here are my remaining questions.","I'm sure some may have read it more than once but this was my first read. I've tried to read carefully and get the gist of what he says. But still I'm left with a few questions. Please share your thoughts on these -  
  
1. Benjamin Graham dismissed IPOs as speculative and compared the investment banks selling IPOs as drunken mud wrestlers.  
Is his point w.r.t IPOs still valid in the present context?  
  
2. Another metric he mentioned was Net Current Asset Value i.e (Total current assets - Total ~~current~~ liabilities)/(# of outstanding shares). As per him any stock selling at less than two-thirds of its NCAV is a bargain.  
Now here, what if a company has a negative NCAV? What does it imply?  
**Edited** - Will a company with negative NCAV fit into Graham's NCAV metric?  
  
3. Finally, the book broke one of the myths I had - stock market can help you become rich.  
Graham clearly calls out to have realistic expectations, not fantasy like and he tells the individual investor to not expect to beat the Pros.  
So is it then really worth it putting so much effort into investing in stocks? *[It may sound as a stupid question but it did occur to me]*",58
16-01-25,42kzzr,"Momentum strategy, adjusted for dividends or not","Hello!

I´m doing some backtest but the goal is to implement the strategy for ”live trading”. I am now wondering what stock price I should use to best reflect actual trading.

I´ve done two tests. One test, which provided great results over a 15-year-period (2000-2014), used “Adjusted close price”, the close price adjusted for dividends and splits from Yahoo Finance on the S&amp;P500, the other which had significantly lower results used “Close price” that included splits but not dividends, other (reliable) source than Yahoo Finance. 

I think that “Adjusted close price” better reflects past performance because it includes the dividends which are part of the overall return. But when I set up the system for live trading, I will not buy the actual stocks at the “Adjusted close price” but at the “Close price”.

I´m thinking about selecting the stocks in the ranking system based on “Adjusted close price” because it reflects past performance better but it would, in my mind at the moment, better reflect reality if I use “Close price” when calculating performance, of course adding dividends and splits IF they occur during the holding period.

Just to recap:

1. Select what stocks to buy any given period using “Adjusted close price” and ranking stocks on their relative performance.
2. Buy the stock at “Close price” and calculate the return from the close price adding dividends and splits IF they occur when I own the stock.

What do you think about that?

16-01-24,42hy9v,"Windfall of a few hundred K, salary bump to low hundred Ks - what to do with it?","Hello there, and thanks for any help, advice, or perspective.

I’m a person in my 20s located in the NYC area that just received a sum in the mid 100K range as well as a pay package that is in the low 100Ks per year and have been thinking about how to use it since it happened a few months ago.

Before this I was earning a little above six figures. I have no debt at all, always pay off my credit cards every month and didn’t take on any debt to get my education. Also already have some savings and a retirement account setup and maxed out every year. Very grateful to be in the position I’m in, I understand that it’s rare and I’m privileged to be here. I don’t want to waste this opportunity. And I also want to give some of what I’ve gotten away to worthy causes, of course!

However, I’m not really sure what to do with the rest of the money though, if anything, besides the normal “pay taxes, index fund” thing. I’m the kind of person that likes to be active with the resources around me, I’m entrepreneurial. I keep reading that I should “sock it away” and “let it grow for the future”. I know it’s kind of cliche, but that just doesn’t sound like fun, nor does it sound like a fun reward. I’m obviously going to see an accountant and wealth manager as well but if anyone else has been through this, maybe you’d have some outside of the box advice.

I have a few ideas of things I personally would like to do with the money but I’m too afraid to pursue most of them based on the advice I've gotten so far. Some of them are:

1. Buy some land close to the city on the water (Hudson River or small lake town within 1.5-2 hrs) and build a house there. Either live there on the weekends or rent out to people. I really like good architecture, have a few friends in that field, and like to think I have decent taste in interior furnishings. Part of this to me would be the challenge of either building things correctly or having it done for me - I don’t want to pay to do things I could reasonably do myself and I’m already pretty handy, like installing cabinets, vanities, wood flooring, etc. So I guess I’m saying I’d view this as a fun project with the reward of having a little place to get away to on the weekends, produce some side cash eventually, or ultimately even sell. Or I’d use a prefab home kit to make it easy. Or maybe buy something existing.

2. Similar plan to number 1 - except in a tropical location. I love the beach, warm weather, enjoy a good swim and a cocktail. So why not acquire land in Puerto Rico or some other location and do something similar? Their economy is kind of in the trash anyway and homes on the beach are going for a song. Then I just think well, if I want to go Puerto Rico or the Caribbean on vacation, just go once or twice and enjoy it rather than build or purchase a home there, maybe I'll get tired of it once the novelty wears off.

3. Purchase something in the city in Queens or Brooklyn - probably just have enough for a good portion and down payment and would still be paying monthly, but would eventually own what I buy. As above would love to restore a place to be better than it is when buying it. Also aware of insanely high taxes and risk factor of becoming a land lord. There are some plots of land to so I suppose I could build myself or with an architect or a prefab thing? I don't know

4. I could just put most of it in index or mutual funds, max out retirement accounts, and generally play it safe. But that just seems kinda boring to me? But maybe I’m just young and naive though.

Anyway, some perspective on this would be great! Thanks.

TL;DR; came into some money and not sure if I should be conservative and save most of it or realize some dreams I’ve had before it happened, at least to some degree, most involving acquiring property, which I keep hearing anecdotally is more trouble than it's worth. Seeing professionals but would love more perspective.",8

16-01-25,42lk9b,Twitter pushes out four top executives in surprise restructuring,"From Mashable:

Twitter went through a major shakeup on Sunday as its heads of engineering, media, product and Vine have exited the company.

After hours of speculation based on various reports, CEO Jack Dorsey confirmed the departures on Twitter, adding that the four chose to leave the company.

Earlier, a major investor in Twitter confirmed the departures but added that they were the result of a long-planned restructuring. The four executives — Katie Stanton, head of media, Kevin Weil, head of product, Alex Roetter, head of engineering and Jason Toff, head of Vine — were all allies of former CEO Dick Costolo and ""were not people in whom Jack has the highest faith,"" the source said.

At least one of the executives called the departure his own decision. 

t's a major executive restructuring for Twitter, which has done little to reassure its investors or the general public that things have changed for the better since co-founder Dorsey returned to the CEO role in October 2015.

Dorsey has been under tremendous pressure to give Twitter a new face and function, and has long hinted that he would have the power to revamp the company's executive ranks. 

The exits, first reported by Re/code and followed by the New York Times, were not initially announced publicly, but there are already additional rumors that the company will name a ""high profile media personality"" to its board.

Twitter went through a major shakeup on Sunday as its heads of engineering, media, product and Vine have exited the company.

After hours of speculation based on various reports, CEO Jack Dorsey confirmed the departures on Twitter, adding that the four chose to leave the company.

The four executives — Katie Stanton, head of media, Kevin Weil, head of product, Alex Roetter, head of engineering and Jason Toff, head of Vine — were all allies of former CEO Dick Costolo and ""were not people in whom Jack has the highest faith,"" the source said.

The exits, first reported by Re/code and followed by the New York Times, were not initially announced publicly, but there are already additional rumors that the company will name a ""high profile media personality"" to its board.


Chris Sacca, a Twitter shareholder and noted tech investor who has agitated for change at the embattled company, appeared to offer a formal endorsement of the moves and dropped what could be considered hints and who Twitter might bring in.

Twitter has been besieged by takeover rumors and other worries as it tries to transform itself for mass appeal, so far to no avail. The company's stock is getting hammered this year, repeatedly reaching new lows. Last week, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey — who is also the CEO of payment startup Square — lost his billionaire status as a result.

Rich Greenfield, analyst for BTIG research, pointed out that these are only the most recent departures in a little more than a year. Only five of the executives that ran Twitter in November of 2014 remain.

Starbucks had its best holiday season ever. Friends complained about the lines. Online shopping broke records and I personally saw a ton of more people at retail than recent years.

Auto Sales record high, gas low and economy slowly improving, makes sense. But has auto sales peaked? Suddenly auto companies are investing heavy into driverless cars. Gearing for the future after a recession or anticipating more demand?

Unemployment low, but is this going to be justified or is it due to ""sharing economy"" companies and seasonal workers?

Housing market has been slowly improving, but why are there still shortages in housing? Are builders still not THAT confident in the economy or millennials really not that interested in buying homes at nearly a historical low interest rate for the US economy?

Let's discuss this and try to add the following below to your response:

1. What is your personal opinion on holiday shopping, did you see a lot of traffic than before in your area? What were people buying?

2. What are you buying this week into earnings?

3. Where do you see the economy heading 5 years from now and what companies do you like for a 5-10 year run.

16-01-26,42pp3i,How do we know that the market will always trend upwards?,"**TLDR: Barring apocalypse, will the stock market always increase over the long term? Why?**

I'm in my early twenties. I've been lurking around this subreddit for a while, and doing lots of reading. It seems predominant advice is ""invest in index funds (basically cover the whole market"" and sit on it until you retire.

Recently, I wondered about how the stock market actually works.

I've read about how [stocks will never go down because more and more debt is created in the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqvKjsIxT_8). I've seen historical data that the market has always gone up since the ""beginning"". It also makes sense because as more assets are created in the world, value of stock market should also trend upwards. As long as human production is greater than consumption, as long as we're continuing to innovate and create technologies and efficiencies, we should be getting richer.

As someone who has many years to look forward to, however- I am left with doubt. Will this always be true? Are there possibilities I am not accounting for?

This is what is driving my doubt (just extreme thought experiments): My understanding is that the stock market is just how much a bunch of people decide different companies in the world are worth added up. This means stocks are just speculation. There isn't actually that much money in the world, nor that much assets. Is it possible that one day everyone realizes this, and we correct to actual values? So Stock $$$ &gt; World Assets $$$: doesn't this mean the whole stock market is a bubble? It seems we have more and more people investing in stocks... but if everyone becomes rich enough to stop working, how can we get richer? You don't have to answer these, they're all unrealistic possibilities, but they are what have been causing me to doubt and ask this next question:

**Barring the apocalypse or some sort of event which makes money and economics completely redundant, is it guaranteed that over the long term, the market will ALWAYS trend upwards? Assume I have more than 50 years before I retire. Can I invest 100% mindlessly into total market index funds for 50 years, or are there things I have to watch out for which may spell the end of the stock market era into a new paradigm of investing? Please point me to where I have to look to understand this.**

I am thinking of this strategy for the next 1-2 years, or however long it takes for oil to recover.

My thoughts:

Upside - As long as oil hovers around current price, I have income ~ 35% investment price per year.  Potential to create $6000 in income on $16000 investment as long as oil stuck at this price.

Neutral case 1- Should oil drop more than 5-10%, income reduces significantly, for instance April $12 calls are only 18 cents, so 80% reduction in income. This can be recovered somewhat by writing longer term calls (Jan $15 calls are 80 cents, which is 10% on investment)

Neutral case 2 - Oil rebounds quickly, and I lose my investment opportunity, but also do not lose money outside of trading fees which are minimal.  I can respond by writing new calls but if we have momentum I may not be inclined to do so.

Unlikely worst case - Oil drops severely, 25% or more, at which case income dramatically reduced or eliminated and I am either writing near the money calls at risk, or holding the position waiting for recover.

/r/investing, shoot holes in my strategy!  It seems near fool proof as I believe the fundamentals are there to not allow oil to fall much further, but I could be wrong.  If we drop to 90s prices then we could be looking at another 25-50% down and this would be bad.

16-01-25,42mldf,"Can somebody please tell me what I've misunderstood about Options?","So I was thinking that because some people don't have enough available funds to exercise their in money put options that they sell them for a value that would incur some profit from immediately exercising the options. So I wanted to but NASDAQ:AAPL as a long term investment. I checked out yahoo finance aapl options http://finance.yahoo.com/q/op?s=aapl+options and I see this one option AAPL160129C00090000 for the 29th Jan strike at $90 ask price of $10.85. So from what I read I understand this is a contract for the option to buy 100 shares of AAPL before the 29th at $90 so if I buy this contract for $10.85 and immediately execute for $9000 and the current price of AAPL is ~$100 so I could then immediately sell those shares and make a profit of ~$1000. This cant be right?? 

What do I understand wrong? Is the $10.85 price per share cause I thought it was for options contract to buy 100 shares?? can somebody help me please. Much appreciated

Edit: Thanks all the answer for pretty straight forward. The price is per share!!! I feel like an idiot.

16-01-26,42q86h,[DD] Extremely bearish $MNKD,"Greetings you mangy fucks. 

I haven’t paid much attention to MannKind, but I read an article about them today, and it piqued my interest. So, here’s my bearish thesis for a thoroughly fucked company.

**Bio:**

MannKind Corporation “focuses on the discovery, development, and commercialization of therapeutic products for diabetes in the United States”. Based out of California, their only drug is Afrezza, which is an insulin inhalation powder that's delivered with a whistle-sized inhaler &amp; used to treat both type 1 &amp; type 2 diabetes. 


**Afrezza Sales:**

Afrezza launched in Feb 2015, &amp; with Sanofi’s sales force, initiated a DTC, or direct-to-consumer, ad campaign. Under the marketing deal struck with Sanofi in 2014, MannKind secured an upfront payment of $150m &amp; had rights to further milestones of $775m, plus a share of profits. However, this was dependedent on the drug’s success. 2015 Q1 sales came in at roughly $1m, falling far short of the $4-5m estimates &amp; have continued to disappoint. The first 3 quarter’s sales totaled $5.4m. To add to the mess, at the beginning of this year, Sanofi terminated the collaboration due to abysmal sales, &amp; will stop selling Afrezza in the next couple months, with rights reverting back to MannKind. A Sanofi spokesperson said the following, ""The product never met even modest expectations and we do not project Afrezza reaching even the lowest patient levels anticipated at the time of entering the license and collaboration agreement, while costs are projected to remain very high for a significant period of time.”

**Other Afrezza Concerns:**

- Afrezza was launched in the aftermath of a Pfizer inhaled insulin drug that also failed &amp; was eventually withdrawn due to poor sales.
- Afrezza has serious side effects for patients with asthma or COPD, such as acute bronchospasm, which is the constriction of airways to the lung. 
    - Additionally, Afrezza’s efficacy is directly impacted by anything else in the lungs, including smoke &amp; nicotine vapor. I did some research &amp; a much larger [percentage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/19709149/) of people with type 2 diabetes smoke than the non-diabetic population.
- After lurking drug forums &amp; /r/diabetes, it seems taking insulin via inhalation is a huge concern for patients as it’s new, they’re skeptical, there isn’t any information on the long term side-effects, &amp; the FDA requires lung testing before patients start therapy (huge problem). Not only that, I read multiple times on the forums that a fair amount of the positive Afrezza testimonials seem to come from people that are financially compensated for their advocacy.

**Receptor Life Sciences:**

In an odd turn of events, &amp; with Afrezza effectively dead, the company entered into a [deal](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AMDA-22AIJ9/1406048244x0x870992/be295beb-3046-46ff-90f0-d50ad4748b16/MNKD_News_2016_1_21_General_Releases.pdf) four days ago with Receptor Life Sciences to use MannKind’s technologies to “develop inhaled formulations of certain undisclosed compounds”. This may sound nice, but if you were to go to Receptor’s [website](http://www.receptorlife.com/) all you would see is a FUCKING PICTURE OF GOD DAMN TREES. If you were to do a [WHOIS](https://whois.icann.org/en/lookup?name=receptorlife.com) search you would notice that the website was created 2 weeks ago. Wait, it gets better. Good old [Fuck ‘em Feuerstein](http://www.thestreet.com/story/13434585/2/biotech-string-editas-ipo-terms-rooting-for-shkreli-in-dc.html) points out that Traci Carman is listed as the company’s president, secretary, treasurer, &amp; director, &amp; that the company address is that of a residence in a Seattle neighborhood. Carman was employed in 2012 as CFO of a music, sci fi, &amp; pop culture museum. 

**Financials:**

The company is absolutely swimming in debt. They have $33m cash &amp; $72m in current assets, $267m in current liabilities &amp; $121m in long term debt. D/E ratio is -3.23. They have nothing.


**Summary:**

I think this fucker is going to zero. They’re due to be delisted on Feb 17, shares are trading at $0.75 &amp; unless Smegli pumps &amp; dumps it or Receptor Life Science’s trees are the most powerful aphrodisiac ever known to mankind (pun intended). Theyyyy areeee fuckked. So, if I can find some shares imma short the fucker, if not I'll grab some puts if I see a good deal. There's no liquidity with $MNKD options. If you don't enter a position, the story is at least interesting &amp; it'll be fun to watch them implode.

16-01-26,42q8ca,What would be your pick for a single stock to hold for 20 years?,"I'm getting ready to invest in a small custodial account for my son.  It's not an account I plan to revisit ever again, as I'll just let it roll over to him when he's 18.  I want to invest in a single stock for him.  What would you pick?

I was thinking of something that's safe yet able to grow in 20+ years.  Maybe something like a defense or medical company.  Tech may be a little too risky.  Dividends would be nice.  I would've thought an energy stock a few years ago, but after seeing oil this year, I think that's out too.

EDIT:  I did a super quick comparison by looking at the past 20 years (I know past performance is not an indicator of future but...)

(Approximate return from 1996)

* DOW:  200%

* CVX:  210%

* JNJ:  300%

EDIT:  Thanks for all your input redditors!  I decided to go with DIS because it's a stock that's been around, and my son will be able to relate to.

Over the past few years I've tried to go with companies that I thought were super risky but had high potential return.  Some examples are MNKD, THQI, FNMA &amp; FMCC, LIQD, NBG, AVEO, and RIG/SDRL.

Clearly those haven't worked out for me, as a ton of them have gone bankrupt or essentially bankrupt and I lost it all.  In doing so, I feel like i've learned valuable lessons, and ultimately what I want now is a diversified account with some risk, but ultimately not gambling....

Sprint had $5.9b at the end of 3Q15 in cash equivalents and short-term investments ($2.1b), revolver ($2.9b), and receivables capacity ($900m).

 Sprint has roughly $32 billion in net debt, with $2.3 billion due to mature on December 1st of this year and another $2.7b due to mature in 2017.

Sprint has ~200MHz of spectrum, valued it at ~$40 billion-
   -14MHz of 850MHz spectrum valued at $8 billion
- 36MHz of PCS spectrum valued at $22 billion
- 150MHz of 2.5GHz spectrum valued at $12 billion (vs. the $14 billion Sprint paid for Clearwire)

A merger of Sprint and T-Mobile would be in both of their best interests. Coupled with T-Mobile popularity &amp; growth and Sprint strong (but not board) networks, this can be a lethal company.

My approach is very similar to Paul Merriman's ""Ultimate Buy and Hold Approach"" seen here (I have fewer bonds, add US mid caps, and don't value tilt like he does [largely because there doesn't seem to be a set standard for what constitutes 'value']): http://paulmerriman.com/the-ultimate-buy-hold-strategy-2014/. I rebalance every year to get back to my target weights. Overall, I understand and love this approach. (feel free to critique it)

Anyways, I've been struggling with whether or not international REITs deserve a place in my portfolio. Currently I allocate about 6.2% of my stocks into them. I saw the $VNQI fund at Vanguard and thought, ""Hey, why not!"" and picked them up. They have the smallest slice of my portfolio pie, but it's still something I care about.

Anyways, the entire approach for buy and hold is that the equity held will eventually go up in value given enough time. The part that I'm skeptical about is when I look at the holdings of VNQI, and see that almost a quarter of the fund is held in Japan.

https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=3358&amp;FundIntExt=INT#tab=2

Question: do you think Japan's real estate is still recovering from the 1980s and still hasn't hit its intrinsic value yet? Because if the whole underlying principle of buy and hold is that assets go up in value given enough time, and Japan's stock market is still recovering from its bubble in the late 80s, then I'm curious if this principle doesn't really work with VNQI. Perhaps I'm being to skeptical here.

Basically, do you think VNQI have a place alongside the SP500, developed markets, REITs, etc in a globally diversified index fund portfolio?",10

16-01-25,42ncy8,Why pick a fund with a higher expense ratio?,"I recently landed my first ""big boy"" job (engineering), and I am learning all about portfolio allocation and optimizing my 457(b). I've been reviewing the options that are provided through our provider (Voya), and I have generally received the ""select the funds with the lowest expense ratio"", advice. Which makes perfect sense. 

What I don't understand is why anyone would pick a more expensive fund if given the two options? Is it simply preying on the uninformed?

For example there are a few Vanguard funds that have expense ratios that are nearly *nine times* less expensive. 

Similarly (not 457(b) related), when you have ranked funds like [these health care funds](http://money.usnews.com/funds/mutual-funds/rankings/health), why *wouldn't* you pick the Vanguard fund?",14

16-01-26,42r8jh,Switching VTI to VUG and VB to VBK to minimize dividends (non-U.S. resident)?,"Hey guys,

Had a question for my own situation, but figured it also might be relevant/worth considering for many others on this sub.

Right now, my portfolio is 40% VTI, 30% VXUS, 20% VB, and 10% VWO (basically, 60/40 US/non-US, with a tilt towards small cap and emerging markets). I'm in my mid-twenties, long time horizon, and have a separate emergency fund, so I'm comfortable taking on a little more risk in my portfolio than just going standard VTI/VXUS/BND.

However, I live outside of the U.S., and am not a U.S. taxpayer. My country has no tax treaty with the U.S., and so I found out that the dividends I'm receiving from my holdings (since they are U.S. ETFs) are actually taxed at 30% (the tax is withheld by my broker automatically).

This makes me think I would be better off switching into lower-dividend ETFs where possible, i.e., towards growth stocks. Specifically, move my VTI (total US stocks) holdings into VUG (large-cap growth), and my VB (small-cap) holdings into VBK (small-cap growth)?

Looking just at Google finance, it does indeed seem VUG has outperformed VTI and VBK has outperformed VB (in terms of price appreciation / excluding dividends), looking far back.

So I just wanted to get a sanity check. Given my 30% tax rate on dividends, does it make sense to shift towards growth/lower dividend-rate ETFs?

Cheers and thanks in advance for any advice!

TL;DR, I pay 30% tax on dividends, should I switch from total market ETFs to growth ETFs where possible? i.e., VTI to VUG, and VB to VBK, etc. Thanks!

EDIT: For anyone else out there in the same situation, I ultimately switched over to LSE-traded (Irish-domiciled) ETFs to avoid the double-taxation. Some good information on the topic and tax consequences can be found here: https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Nonresident_alien_with_no_US_tax_treaty_%26_Irish_ETFs. Specifically I went for a blend of IWDA (total developed world), VUSD (S&amp;P 500), and EIMI (total emerging markets).",10

16-01-26,42rdze,[News] Traders Are Withdrawing Money From VIX Funds ETFs Like Never Before,"#Traders Are Withdrawing Money From VIX Funds Like Never Before -- 2016-01-26 00:00:01.1 GMT


By Camila Russo (Bloomberg) -- While stocks are having a chaotic start to the year, investors are pulling money from securities that profit from higher volatility at the same time as short sellers are piling into bets that tranquility will return.

 

Traders yanked $850 million from two of the most popular exchange-traded products tracking moves in the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index in January. That’s even as the gauge of investor anxiousness known as the VIX is set for its biggest monthly surge since August. In one note, bearish bets briefly climbed to more than 100 percent of shares outstanding.

 

The positioning reflects speculation that something will cause volatility to drain out of a U.S. stock market where as much as $2.4 trillionof value was erased. Traders such as Mizuho Securities USA Inc.’s Monish Shahand JonesTrading Institutional Services’ Dave Lutzsay the selloff has gone too far and that central banks will help counter the effects of a Chinese economic slowdown and slump in oil.

 

“Central banks, historically acting as shock absorbers, eventually came to the rescue and adopted a dovish tone, thereby implicitly indicating that ‘We are here to take care of the situation, so don’t worry,”’ said Shah, the head of ETF business at Mizuho Securities in New York. “This will help stabilize the market and reduce volatility in the short term.”

 

How high did volatility get this year? Consider that last week, front-month VIX futures were 22 percent higher than those expiring in July. That’s the biggest premium since September and one of the highest since 2011 for contracts that usually cost less than longer-term bets.

 

The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index has lost 8.2 percent this month, heading for its biggest plunge since May 2010, on mounting worries that the Federal Reserve removed its life support too soon. The VIX, which tends to move inversely to U.S. stocks, has risen 33 percent -- and securities that climb with it have jumped too.

 

Yet both the iPath S&amp;P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN and the ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures have seen outflows in January. What’s more, short interest for the two has risen, according to Markit data. It surged to 89 percent of shares outstanding for the iPath ETN and to 29 percent for the ProShares fund, from 2.6 percent earlier this month.

 

Rather than signaling a decline in volatility, outflows could just mean that investors are cashing out, according to Nicola Marinelli of Pentalpha Capital Ltd.

 

“This stuff makes money only in few instances, so when that happens you take profit,” said Marinelli, a fund manager who helps oversee 114 million euros ($124 million) at Pentalpha in London. “Central banks have less and less power.”

 

The VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN, which moves in opposite direction to the volatility index, has seen inflows this month, and its short interest also rose. Yet those are not what they used to be -- the $456 million it gathered is less than half what traders put in during the August-September rout. For Macro Risk Advisors, that’s a sign investors are no longer interested in buying the dip, according to a Jan. 25 note.

 

Lutz, head of ETF trading for JonesTrading, is in the camp betting the wild days will subside. In addition to dovish central-bank statements, stocks should get a boost from the earnings season, which has started better than expected, he said. McDonald’s Corp. posted its best quarterly growth in almost four years, and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. reported profit that beat analyst projections.

 

“A lot of people feel that the front end of the VIX curve - - so volatility protection for the next month or two -- got very elevated relative to the rest of the VIX curve, so we’ve had people selling those products,” Lutz said by phone from Annapolis, Maryland. “They see the sharp selloff that we had to start the year was overdone. With the ECB and BOJ getting ready start to add more stimulus into the system, that should offset the impact of the Fed raising rates.”

16-01-26,42uhzw,$GNPT - Multi Day Runner,"GNPT has been on a tear since it released news that it secured a $5,000,000 SBA loan at Prime plus 2.75%, paid back over a term of 25 years.

This is not toxic, dilutive, financing from some shady loan shark.  [SBA's are real loans for small businesses from the federal government.](https://www.sba.gov/content/sba-loans)

The loan package reduced the company's debt (principle and interest) expense by approximately 75%.  The loan proceeds also resolved all pending creditor litigations and various short-term loan obligations were paid.

3Q2015 the company actually turned a profit of more than $350,000.  Now that the company's debt expense has been slashed by 75% that profit margin is expected to go up significantly.

There has been quite a lot of dilution over the second half of 2015, but that dillution seems to have stopped as calls to the TA (un-gagged!) reveal that the OS remains unchanged.

This company has also never done a reverse split, which is a hallmark of all share selling scams on the OTC.

Upcoming catalysts are months out in the form of the yearly 10-K die in April, which will provide details about 4Q2015 revenues/profits, and in May the 1Q2016 10-Q which should show massive amounts of toxic debt wiped off the books using proceeds from the SBA loan.

16-01-27,42ulso,Help me sound knowledgeable on stocks please!,"Hi /r/investing,

I need your help!! I’m new to investing and the stock market. I have a Roth IRA with a few holdings that have been sitting for a number of years. My father has made a lot of money on the stock market (former banker) and has agreed to teach me about stocks now that I am older and interested. 

One of my positions that I own is Las Vegas Sands (LVS). He stated that he wanted me to research any stock that I own – I picked LVS (he wants me to spend 4-5 hours on research), give a 5-10 minute presentation (why the stock is a good choice, etc) and then he will ask me 6-8 questions on the stock. These questions are intended to make me realize just how much research you must do/what goes into researching a stock. Things that  an average investor would never think about. He said these questions won’t be numbers based “What is the revenue, P/E etc” but thought provoking ones. 

He gave me a question/comment the other day. Which he said was a simple one. He stated the first thing to realize is what business your stock is in. He asked what business is Disney in? What is their largest source of revenue? 

I came up with a list – Licensing, movie rights, merchandise none of them represented the largest source of income/revenue for Disney. He finally told me that it was ESPN and that Disney owns that. Which is why the stock dipped slightly when someone (forgot the name) stated on TV that cable will soon allow unbundling of TV channels (I.E ESPN) 

I’m asking you /r/investing to help me learn about LVS. What are some questions he could throw at me that an average investor wouldn’t think about? What should I know?

He said after my presentation/answering of the questions. He would present me the report (which I can gladly share on here) when I get it that he created on LVS. He said he spent over 40 hours researching the stock after I chose it.  He says it’s not about LVS. It could have been any stock but he want’s to show me what he researched and how. I’m hoping to be able to answer a few of the questions! My presentation is in the middle of February. 

Thank you!

Medicare is prohibited from receiving ""best price"" to provide incentives to drugmakers to develop drugs for conditions that affect patients over 65 years of age.

16-01-26,42onyr,The United States Federal Reserve in relation to the U.S. Economy (Stocks),"The U.S. Federal Reserve is a massive agency that lends a firm, yet guiding hand for the U.S. Economy. 

Though there are many branches to the Federal Reserve, I want to focus on the Federal Funds Rate (Interest Rates).

From my perspective, the FEDS will lower interest rates if analysts suspect the markets will perform poorly. On the other hand, The Feds will increase rates if analysts suspect the markets have reached or will soon reach their peaks.

Depository Banks such as Wells Fargo, Bank of America or even Credit Unions are required by U.S. Law to maintain at least 10% of their assests in cash value. The goal is to prevent banks from being overstrained and to safeguard against another financial depression.

When Banks issue money, they recoupe their losses by tacking on interest rates. These help pay worker salary and keep the lights on. 

When Banks are in need of Money, the Federal Reserve will sell the financial institutions ""Debt"" in the form of a loan. This money can be used by a bank to create even more money. 

When the federal reserve adds more money to a system (society), interest rates become lower due to competition. This stimulates the U.S. economy because people take advantage of the low rates and purchase trade goods (Cars, Houses and Entertainment). This creates jobs.

Question: Why would the FEDS ever INCREASE rates? Wouldn't this hurt the economy and production. Why wouldn't the U.S. Federal Reserve Keep Interest rates at 0.
Are the FEDS trying to earn money for the U.S. Treasury?

16-01-26,42sb7h,"[RESEARCH] $AAPL -- FQ1'16 Preview: Cautious given slower buyback, supply chain weakness, poor macro data - ALERT","**iPhone expectations lower:** We are forecasting ~76m iPhone shipments in FQ1 (to Dec) and ~55m units in FQ2 (to Mar). We believe that general buy-side expectations are in the low 70s for FQ1 and ~50m for FQ2. Based on our model, ~50m iPhones for FQ2 would translate into total revenue of ~$52bn (-10% Y/Y), ~6% below our current estimate of $55.5bn and 6% below Bloomberg consensus of ~$55.7bn.

**China Mobile 4G net adds:** 4G net adds momentum recovered at China Mobile towards the end of FQ1. Net Adds grew 33% Y/Y in December, up from 19% in November but below the 46% Y/Y in October.

**Lower repurchases:** Between Oct 9 and Dec 28, we believe that Apple reduced its net share count by ~31m, implying a net repurchase of ~571k shares/trading day (in ~54 trading days) vs. ~647k shares/workday last year (in ~61 trading days). We are slightly concerned that our total repurchase estimate of ~$7.5bn for FQ1 (+49% Y/Y) may turn out to be optimistic.

**Asia supply chain indications:** Our Asian supply chain analysts believe that build plans for FQ2 have likely stabilized in the 40-45m range now, down from 45-50m in December. If correct we believe this would likely be due to higher inventory levels exiting FQ1. We note that 5 days during the holidays in 2015 fell into FQ2 vs. 4 days in 2014, and 3 days in 2013 – thus exacerbating possible demand weakness but potentially then helping units in FQ2.

**Weak Europe/US supply chain results:** Beginning in October with Dialog and continuing right through January with weak reports from Qorvo, Cirrus Logic, Multi-Fineline Electronix and ADI, the supply chain has been almost universally weak leading up to this report.

**ASP risk:** We believe there is some risk to our $680 ASP estimate for the iPhone given continued mix shift toward the lower-priced iPhone 6 away from the 6s. This shift would likely have been exacerbated by macro-driven demand weakness.

**FX headwinds:** FX remains a headwind for FQ1’16, in our opinion. According to Apple, unfavorable FX had a negative 8pp impact on Y/Y revenue growth in FQ4’15 and ~4pp negative impact in FQ1’15.

**FQ1’16 estimates/guidance/consensus:** For FQ1’16, we are forecasting total revenue of $76.72bn (cons: $76.59bn, guid: $75.5-77.5bn), gross margin of 39.8% (cons: 39.9%, guid: 39.0-40.0%), opex of $6.31bn (cons: $6.42bn, guid: $6.30- 6.40bn), EBIT margin of 31.6% (cons: 31.5%), Non-GAAP EPS of $3.37 and GAAP EPS of $3.25 (cons: $3.23).

**FQ2’16 estimates/consensus:** For FQ2’16, we forecast total revenue of $55.49bn (cons: $55.73bn), gross margin of 39.7% (cons: 40.0%), opex of $5.80bn (cons: $5.74bn), EBIT margin of 29.3% (cons: 29.7%), Non GAAP EPS of $2.36 and EPS of $2.24 (cons: $2.22).

16-01-27,42vjtg,"YOLO binary event that could pay off huge: Sept 16 ZINC Call Options $.50 strike, currently trading at $.05","These call options currently trade at $.05 each, but may be worth much, much more if ZINC management can find a way to make a $1.5M loan payment in February.

The underlying shares are currently trading at 28 cents, down from $12 last July. Famed fund manager Monish Pabrai was buying hand over fist at around $8 per share, as he recognized ZINC's unique position within the metals market. The reason the stock is so beaten down since then is because ZINC recently asked its creditor for a payment extension on its debt. As a result,the short selling sharks are smelling blood in the water, while the weak hands longs are smelling something foul coming from their underwear and are exiting quickly.

Most traders are currently thinking that this is your typical Molycorp or Arch Coal style pending bankruptcy, but I think bit differently.

The major reason that ZINC is struggling financially is because they have a recently built plant in North Carolina that has had some operational inefficiencies and setbacks; as a result, the plant is operating at 70% of capacity, and bleeding money (despite their other 6 global plants operating fine). Couple this with weak Zinc prices globally, and the company is hemorrhaging cash. They just announced today that they are idling the North Carolina plant and laying off 200 workers. I hope that they are doing this so that they can make the debt payment in February, but am not sure if this is the intention.

In my opinion, this type of financial distress is much different than what Arch Coal was facing (and hopefully is viewed differently by creditors as well). Arch coal was an indebted company in a doomed industry, while ZINC is indebted company trying to get a plant up to speed while dealing with temporarily weak Zinc prices. One of these situations is solvable.

Here is how I view this situation:

There is a 70% chance you will lose all your money from these call options. However, if ZINC is able to make the debt payment in February, the share price will immediately head back to $2+ easily:

500 calls @ .05 = $2,500 risk

Profit if ZINC shares trade @ $2.00 prior to expiration = $72,500

Like I said, I think there is a 70% chance this doesn't work out, but the probable profit if it does work out is worth the risk in my opinion. Also, if management were to file for a secondary share offering tomorrow to help cover this debt, I believe the shares would shoot up to $2. Like I said, this company has an extremely solid business model, but not having the plant operating at full capacity zinc prices is really killing things.

Good luck, and please do your own due diligence. I'm just one YOLO stock pumper.

So I'm using Google Sheets as my new primary tool instead of standard Excel for tracking my portfolio. I've gotten pretty acquainted to =Googlefinance. 

I'd like to take this tracking to the next level and begin to migrate my valuation sheet that I use to assess stocks onto Google Finance. I'm trying to import the annual Cash Flows, Balance Sheet and Income Statement onto Google Sheets but I'm running into issues.

When I use the following string:

=IMPORTHTML(""http://finance.yahoo.com/q/is?s=AAPL&amp;annual"",""table"",11)

It imports exactly what I want. The annual tables of the income statement. I can do the same stuff for the Balance Sheet and CF. What I want to do is have the string reference a cell. So that I can for instance have KO in cell A1 and it'll quickly import the data. Having issues with this.

https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/42mjw9/idea_review_long_uso_w_otm_covered_calls/

Many of you gave me great advice and feedback on my idea to go long USO and write 3 month calls for income and a long term play that USO will increase in value.

One concern raised was contango, or the inability for USO to track Crude oil prices due to the nature of the fund.  Other suggested choices were USL, XLE and VDE.  I went with USO and here is why:

 - Looking at the 5 year price change of Crude vs USO, USL and XLE, Crude is down 67.7% while USO, USL, and XLE are down 77.37%, 67.95% and 24.14% respectively.  It just did not seem that XLE tracked oil, and while it is influenced by oil prices, it is not a reflection and so XLE (and VDE had a similar problem) were out for this trade.

USL tracked better than USO as /u/poof312 suggested, near perfect tracking for the last 5 years.  However, I went with USO for a few factors:

 - USO's time premium in the current option chain is better.  The ATM April call was 9.5% current price of USO vs 7.03% of USL.  As I profit from time premium built in, it is important to me that this premium is the highest.

 - USL did not have from what I could see 12 month out options.  If this trade goes south it will be important for me to trade longer term options so I can create some income, as the 3 month options at my purchase price of the stock will be worthless.

 - USO had tighter spreads in the options chains than USL (no data here but this was anecdotal as I was reviewing).

Finally, [here is a link to the final trade](http://imgur.com/fcaqiEB).  I've committed 50% of my capital in this account for this and will commit the other 50% in a couple days to average out the short term volatility.

Ill update everyone once a month or so on how this trade is doing.",42

16-01-27,42wjo1,"Apple can't keep relying on the iPhone forever — it needs a new hit","The Apple Watch is not the hit Apple needed. Apple didn't release sales figures for it, except to say that December was its best quarter ever, but the anecdotal evidence is pretty overwhelming. 
Same thing with Apple TV: nice product, slowly growing sales every quarter, but not particularly material to earnings. It's lumped with the Watch and Beats headphones in the ""Other"" category, which delivered $4.3 billion in revenue out of Apple's $75.9 billion in total.
Plus, Apple's record with services is bad. Apple Maps still isn't as good as Google Maps. Siri works right about half the time. Also, iCloud is confoundingly frustrating — I just had a problem updating my iPhone software because my iCloud storage was full to capacity and they wanted me to buy more. I wasn't even aware I'd turned it on. And Apple Music is a buggy mess.
Don't get me wrong: Apple is not in trouble. It just posted the biggest quarterly profit of any company in history. It has more than $200 billion in cash and investments sitting on its balance sheet. More than 1 billion Apple devices are being actively used right now, and Apple can theoretically sell services and downloads to all of them. It will continue to iterate on its existing hit products, particularly the iPhone, to keep people upgrading every two or three releases.
But for a company to keep growing at the rate Apple grew during the last decade, it can't just keep reworking the same old classics. It has to deliver new hits, too.

16-01-26,42ta3n,Fitbit ER play,"Note: I'm not going making this play, because reasons, so take this with a grain of salt. However, I do think it is a good play for others.

Fitbit is estimated to have an ER coming up this Monday (2/1/16). Two previous ERs for Fitbit have been huge success, beating their projections by [170 and 280%](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/fit). Both of these lead to large jumps in the stock price as well.

Recently however, the price of Fitbit has been driving down, dropping by nearly 50% in the past month, putting the stock even lower than it was at the IPO. This was spurred by Apple announcing they have no interest in acquiring Fitbit and some lawsuits against the company. Despite this, many analysts are still calling for a $25-$30 price point.

Now, the projections for this quarter are much higher than the previous ones, so it will be harder to beat. Still, I think there is a good chance that Fitbit over performs:

* Athletic companies like Nike and Lululemon have been killing it in sales recently, largely driven by people buying their products for both working out and casual wear. I think Fitbit will fall into this category as well, as it has become a fashionable device and not just for athletic wear.
* Fitbit's app was the top app on iTunes around Christmas, suggesting that they sold a ton of devices during the holiday, making it even more likely that they beat the ER

Fitbit was holding around $30 when its was projected for .2 EPS at the ER. It has dropped by over $10 a share since then, but is still likely to beat this projection. I'm not nearly good enough at this to suggest what price it will go to, hell I'm not even sure it will go up. But as far as YOLOs go, I think there is good evidence this one will work. Originally I had thought this would be a good options play, but at the moment I can't confirm *for sure* that the ER will be this Monday. If it is, getting some calls that expire the 5th would be the play in my mind. 

Tl;Dr - Fitbit *should* have an ER soon, which evidence suggests they *should* beat. Recent news unrelated to sales has driven the price down, so this may be a good point to buy in and ride it up a few dollars.",8

16-01-26,42tc23,"[RESEARCH 2] $AAPL -- Expect weak guidance, but likely priced in; pullback is opportunity","**What's changed**

Apple will report Dec quarter results after the market close on Jan 26. We are forecasting F1Q (Dec) revenues of $76.8bn (+3% yoy, vs. guidance of $75.5-77.5bn), in line with consensus, and EPS of $3.28 vs. consensus at $3.24. For F2Q (Mar), we are modeling revenues and EPS of $57.1bn (-2% yoy) and $2.30 vs. consensus of $56.5bn/$2.26. **We expect guidance for the March quarter to be $53-55bn in revenues,** accounting for Apple’s typical conservatism, which we believe is above buyside expectations.

**Implications**
Apple shares are down 12% over the last month, in line with our coverage but worse than the S&amp;P/Nasdaq decline of 8%/10%, as a number of negative supply chain datapoints have pointed to weaker iPhone sales.Indeed, our survey of 1,000 US consumers last week shows that holidaypurchases of the iPhone were below original expectations, while higher prices in key int’l markets (to offset their FX depreciation) have dampened demand in certain regions such as Japan. We see the current weakness as a buying opportunity, for several reasons: 

**(1)** we believe the guide-down is already expected/priced in, 

**(2)** Apple is a defensive stock relative to the current market sell-off, 

**(3)** the March quarter represents the trough in yoy revenue growth, which is typically a good time to buy hardware stocks, with easing comps and the next product cycles (iPhone 5e, 7) driving acceleration for the remainder of the year, and

**(4)** we expect the multiple to increasingly reflect the evolution to “Apple-as-a-Service” (recurring hardware &amp; services as users shift to iPhone installment plans and adopt new products/services in the Apple ecosystem, such as Apple TV, Music, Pay, Watch, etc., making the 500mn iPhone installed base stickier).

**Valuation**
Our 12-month price target of $155 is based on 15X our CY16 EPS of $10.32.

**Key risks**
Product cycle execution, end demand, and a slower pace of innovation

I left a fake stock watchlist on Google Finance for 3 years with AAPL and AMZN and other large companies without caring about anything else, and I've made a 74% return over 3 years. Why not just do that instead of scourging the field for smaller companies? 

For Apple, for example, I would sell a day after they make their next iPhone announcement. Amazon I'd sell once it reaches it's peak on the Fibonacci.

16-01-27,42ztlw,College,"I hope this finds you all well,
I am currently a 20 year old sophomore enrolled at a decent state university (went for the scholarships) and feel like I am wasting my time. My classes are long for the amount of information we learn. We cover few chapters in the books and miss out on the majority of the information in them, whether it be physics, art history, or accounting.
This feels like a complete waste of time. I am much happier at a computer researching financial topics and how to apply them. I believe I would be much more successful working with financial professionals than sitting in a classroom.
I have done countless hours of research on how to enter the financial industry, and what a financial analyst/investment banker does and how to become one, but they all seem to start with a college degree.
I understand that I will not start managing funds overnight, but feel like each day is a day filled with hours of wasted time. I am interested in a career in finance, and honestly, would drop out if I landed a decent gig at a firm. Is this even feasible? I would do it in a heart beat.
I have a decent list of books to read on investing, a good resume/GPA, and will begin handling small amounts of funds to start an investing track record.
I believe I (and many others) should begin working in their preferred industries to get as much experience as possible. Most of the information I am learning is irrelevant, but hey I'll get a cool degree.
I wouldn't mind earning my CFA I and would work extremely hard to earn it, just to prove I understand general financial concepts. However, I cannot take it anytime soon due to their requirements.
Is there anyway around this, or anyway to land a job/internship with career potential at this time? How could I go about breaking the stereotypical ""get degree&amp;internship -&gt; get decent job"" theme in the financial industry?
Thanks in advance for the guidance and support!",5

I think that Bernie is the only one besides Hillary that has a chance at winning, so I like short Rubio or short Trump / long Bernie at these prices. 

I think outright short Trump is also probably a safe play. I can't really imagine him gaining any ground from here, but I can certainly see him losing it. Could make for a good trade.

16-01-27,42zuae,"Price to earnings question - can't figure out SP500 PE","Today SP500 is at 1890.

[multipl.com](http://www.multpl.com/) claims PE=20.76 today.  This implies earnings of 1890/20.76=$91, using 2014-Q4 to 2015-Q3 [real earning per share](http://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-earnings/).

But [yardeni.com](http://www.yardeni.com/pub/peacockfeval.pdf) says that earnings for 2015 Q1-Q3 are about $30 a quarter, suggesting that earnings for 2014-Q4 to 2015-Q3 is more like $120, and PE=16, not 20.76.

Now the spreadsheet [here, upon which multipl is supposedly based](http://us.spindices.com/indices/equity/sp-500), says ""2015 Est Oper PE""=19.16 (row 43) but also says ""2015 EST PE=17.52"" (row 76) based on 2015 EST earnings of  $106.65.  The Q3,Q4 earnings are lower of those than yardeni.com.

So, in short, I can get 2015 PE anywhere from 16 to 21, or historically-priced to somewhat over-priced.

Why?  What's the real PE? 


**edit** - here's part of answer, I think - in the SP spreadsheet (Additonal Info menu button [here](http://www.spindices.com/indices/equity/sp-500)), operating earnings are about $104 for 2014-Q4 to 2015-Q3 but 'as reported' earnings about $90.   This is much of the difference.  If I use 2015-Q1 to 2015-Q4-EST operating earnings from the spreadsheet, I get operating earnings of $94.86 and PE=19.8.

The reported PE seems to use as-reported earnings, which takes one-time charges into account.  But even the higher operating earnings are below the $30/quarter operating earnings level of yardeni (Fig 5). Yardeni uses an estimate consensus, but this should approach true earnings as 2015 draws to a close. Certainly not a $15 difference between yardeni operating and SP operating.

So now there are 3 types of earnings: yardeni operating ($120), SP operating ($106), and SP reported ($94).   As long as SP 'as-reported' is used consistently throughout history, then it might to say that the market is priced on the high side (ignoring low interest rate environment).   

Here's a [good article](http://avondaleam.com/why-you-should-value-the-sp-500-based-on-as-reported-earnings/) on why to use reported earnings  - because 'one-time' charges tend to knock 10% off reported earnings, averaged over the years.

16-01-27,42zutc,"My new investing experiment, instructions inside. Want to play along?","I decided to start a new investment project this month and I want to share how things are going: 

As a background, most of my investments in the past have been buy and hold. I've experimented with stocks and options (buying and selling, and day trading), I have been in and out of real estate and have more than a bit of experience with nearly all angles of startups, etc. in short, as a qualifier, I've been there and done that, many times, more than a sane person would ever have done.

So on with my current project. It's small. But it's fun so far, and I think it can be big. 

First, earlier this month I decided to finally fund my Robinhood account. I've had in invitation since the very start, but never actually threw any money in. I used this as the proving ground for my test since it's completely separate from all my other holdings. It will allow me to track performance easily. 

Here are the rules of my project:


Funding rules:

    1. Start with $100.00 (to open the account)

    2. Add in any ""found"" money to the account immediately. (for example, I made $50.00 in Jury duty and put it into the account) I would put things like tax returns, eBay sales, etc. into the category. The idea is to take all the extra ""income"" that usually amounts to nothing and gets spent immediately and see what you can turn it into. 

    3. I've also added a ""funding tax"" on my personal activities - Basically, on every non-essential purchase I make - i.e. If I buy a Starbucks coffee for $5.00, I ""match"" that $5.00 into the account. Robinhood makes it really easy to deposit, so I do this every time I spend money, as I spend it. This has two benefits, one, I'm likely to spend less on frivolous purchases since items now ""cost"" twice as much. And if I do spend, I ""save"" at the same rate since I'm funding. (So far, I've added about $70.00 this way) My rules state that things like groceries don't count, but eating out, fast food or coffee does, this adds another benefit in that I can possibly transform my behavior over time.


Investing rules:

    1. Using Robinhood, I have $0.00 commissions. So no purchase or sale is too small or expensive. (I've made a dozen or so trades in the account at this point)

    2. ONLY long trades, and ONLY stocks (short ETF's would be permissible). - Every trade needs to clear as Robinhood does not yet have Margin, and there is no shorting or options that I can see. This has been frustrating, since I'm used to being able to buy and sell immediately without a ""clearing period"", but I've found this has actually added to the fun and made me think harder about how to ""invest"" the cash I do have available. It's also created a sense of joy when I do add funds as I know that I'll have more capital to play with. If Robinhood introduces Margin, I would probably change this rule. 

    2. Every time I buy any stock, I MUST immediately place a sell order for that stock. It can be what I think it will get to that day, or week or whatever, but a position MUST have an exit that I'm not emotionally driven to avoid. - FYI, Robinhood does not flag their regular accounts as ""pattern day trader"" accounts even with multiple same--day trades since each trade needs to clear, So I can technically buy/sell the same security five times in a week and not be a pattern day trader according to whatever rules they are following. 


Withdrawal rules:

    1. I'm thinking a Tesla.  

My current results (since Jan 7 -- 20 days)

Total account value: $216.33
Cash added to the account: $208.07
Total profit (at end of day today): 3.97% - $8.26
Total withdrawal: no Tesla yet. 

Like I said, it's not big right now, but I really like how this little experiment feels and I thought I'd share. ",3

I have currently 109,000 in the fidelity puritan fund which I got through an inheritance. It started out as 124,000, but its currently lost some value. I was looking for something moderate risk, but one thing I did not take into account was the fees and capital gains. The fund pays a huge capital gains in October and the expense ratio is .56 which is pretty expensive compared to other funds. 
I'd like to move 60% to my fidelity total market, 10% to FSIVX, international total market fund. I'd like to move the other 30% to a bond index, but i'm not really sure where to go. Here are the choices I can pick from. Now, I know Vanguard is a little cheaper, but I'd like to stick with Fidelity.

I think i'm playing it safe but staying away from stocks, I know there is risk, but for someone like me just following an index is the best way to go.

* I'd like help with two portfolios. One for my SEP IRA that would be about a 6.5 in risk. The second would be my regular brokerage account with a 8 in risk. Any faults in using my Etrade accounts for all of this?

* I am invested in things right now that are about a 9 in risk - eg. oil midstreams / downstreams &amp; REITS (VER &amp; GNL)) I can get specific on those if anyone cares. The rest I have is cash.

* Paid off company vans / cars. No expenses really except rent &amp; health care ($1000 a month roughly). Oh and a girlfriend.

* Time horizon is until I die. I don't need this money to live so I might as well put it to work. It would be my ideal scenario to be living off dividends of well invested money by the time I'm in my 50's. If real estate ever crashes again in California I wouldn't hesitate to pull whatever money is needed out of my investments to pick up good apartment complex deals.

* Zero debt.

* I've looked through many people's hellomoney portfolio examples on here and I've realized I'm not very smart. I'm not even sure I know what I should do given my circumstances so thanks in advance for any and all guidance.

* Currently have 70K in cash. 20K of that needs to go towards my SEP IRA contribution (it's already in my SEP IRA Etrade account ready to go). I will be continuously adding to both portfolios twice a year or whenever there is a major buying opportunity.",1

16-01-27,430bn6,Maybe someone will find this useful... basic explanation of 100% equity being bad.,"Someone sent me a message a few days ago and I wanted to give it real attention. I just wrote out a response now, and as soon as I finished it, I realized I was sending it to [deleted]. So... I'm a little annoyed, and here's what I wrote, maybe someone can learn from it:

100% equity is probably never a good idea in general. Even if you went into other ""high-risk"" asset classes (same expected return with imperfect correlation), you'd be better off.

If we take ""index funds"" to mean ""passive investing,"" then yes, in the context of deciding an asset allocation you definitely want to use index funds as your investable universe. The question of ""how good is this allocation"" should have the same answer regardless of the quality of the funds' asset managers because ideally you are buying funds that precisely mimic the asset class you want.

It's important to recognize that there are a lot of different assets in the world. Like, a crazy amount, and most people don't bother considering even half of them. If you ask the typical retard in /r/personalfinance, they'll say ""x% stocks + y% bonds = 100%"" and think they've made a stellar portfolio, or that any dimension beyond that is ""overly complex"" and therefore worse (or they'll call you a salesman and a thief if you try to convince them that there's more to the world than 2 assets). Even within ""stocks,"" there's a ton of stuff. Total Stock Market will get you 3500 - 4000 equity securities, but you're still at the mercy of what's included in the benchmark (VTSMX is benchmarked to CRSP Total Market which has 3722 securities, and VTSMX holds 3751 as of 12/31/2015). So that's some concept of the equity universe in the United States, but the benchmark is market cap weighted. That's great in aggregate, and great for fund managers, because it means everyone can all hold the index simultaneously (everyone has identical weights which equal the market weight of each security, so individual portfolios naturally sum to the market portfolio) and no trading/rebalancing is necessary to match the index until the index itself rebalances (the weight is dictated by prices, and the prices of every security are the same no matter who you are, so everyone's weights move together). But with that list of ~3700 stocks, you *could* adopt an infinite set of portfolio weights (including setting 0-3700 of those stocks to weight = 0), and each one of them will have a different return, and those differences are meaningful. The Russell 1000 is a portfolio of those 3700 stocks at particular weights where 2700 are 0. The S&amp;P 500 is another portfolio of those 3700 stocks at particular weights where 3200 are 0. A sector index could have 3500/3700 at weight 0. But all those equity indices share the same universe. You bought everything there is to buy, but you chose to let the market determine your weights for you, and maybe that's not optimal.

A lot of arguments in favor of 100% equity tend to be ""if you held 100% in any asset class, equity wins over a sufficiently long period."" Similarly, people will say ""if you take the total return over X decades for each asset class, equity is the highest, so any portfolio you can make of &lt; 100% equity + &gt; 0% in another asset class will have a lower return than 100% equity since you're adding a component that performed worse."" Both of those arguments are garbage because you are not supposed to make 1 purchasing decision and live it with (i.e. let your portfolio weights float thereafter) forever. The key to outperforming all equity is periodic rebalancing, and that will potentially allow you to have a better portfolio before you even consider leverage (and certainly after you leverage the portfolio to the same volatility as equity).

Take a look here: http://7twelveportfolio.com/Back-Tested.html

Large US Equity I'm pretty sure is the S&amp;P 500, and the bottom of the table lists geometric return and volatility. Higher geometric return means a higher total return at the end, so S&amp;P 500 outperformed the equal-weighted portfolio on a 1:1 basis (100% S&amp;P is better than 100% multiasset portfolio). But the tradeoff is about 0.5% per year of return in exchange for 7% volatility. If you take the arithmetic average instead of the geometric average of the annual returns, S&amp;P is at 11.74% and the multiasset portfolio is at 10.29%. But if you scale the multiasset portfolio to have the same volatility, it would have an average arithmetic return of 10.29% * (17.31% / 10.31%) = 17.28%, and you'd be leveraged to a 168% weight portfolio. You'd have to pay *something* for that leverage, so the return you actually get would be 17.28% - cost of borrowing, so even if you said your borrowing cost were 5% for the entire period that would mean your average return would be 17.28% - 0.68 * 5% = 13.88%. You're still beating the S&amp;P 500 return for the same level of risk where more than 1/4 of your portfolio is in cash and bonds.

Basically if you have no intention of ever deviating from zero leverage, passive investing, and very broad definitions of asset classes like ""stock"" and ""bond,"" then it's difficult to find something better than 100% ""stock"" in terms of long-term total return. But those shouldn't be constraints if you are actually trying to make a good portfolio, and MPT assumes those constraints don't exist when it makes (correct) claims that you can outperform all equity.",65
16-01-27,42x4of,£10K TO INVEST - What is the best option?,"Hi guys, I have been reading over this sub for a while now and love some of the information that is posted, I have come to the point where I now need some sound advice. 

At this point in time I am now able to access life savings money that was once locked away. I have roughly £10k and it is currently sat in an account doing nothing (very small interest rates on this). 

I want to put this money to good use and make it grow. I know this sounds lazy but I have a lot going on at this point in my life so I don't have time to watch stocks or fluctuating stats to make my money grow so ideally I need a ""set and forget"" option so to speak. 

I've heard of wealthfront.com and that is something I'm looking at but I would like a plethora of options from you guys! 

Also any savvy assets that you think might be viable I would also take into consideration. (property?)

16-01-26,42tsn1,"Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF not tracking benchmark","Hello Reddit,

I'm a novice Canadian investor with a small stake in an S&amp;P tracking etf (VFV:CA). Over the past few days I have noticed the benchmark S&amp;P significantly outperform this fund. Today there was nearly a 1.5% percent lag between the S&amp;P (+1.41%) and VFV(-0.11%). 

I was under the impression the fund would track the index to a reasonable extent as it is holding essentially all the same securities? 

I am not too worried about this but I am curious as to why this fund is diverging from the benchmark regularly. 

Thanks,

Harrison

I'm 90% sure all of the replies here are going to be along the lines of ""HE SALTY LMAO"" but there's some interesting academic arguments here:

1. Index fund inflows cause an overvaluation of indexed stocks without regard to fundamentals, which could cause a decrease in return (as inflated valuations are less likely to continue to increase greatly), which would cause outflows, which causes a cascading failure.
2. (and I think the more compelling and interesting argument) As passive funds become major shareholders of companies, it reduces performance requirements of management as they are less likely to vote on proxies, demand better performance, demand competition between all the companies they ""own"", etc.

Interesting counterarguments to what is becoming a very common practice in the investing world.",14

I'm looking for a loan with the best interest rate I can get. I could back it up with $500k in assets (already in VTSAX). Any suggestions?

I've looked at:

- margin investing (6-7%)

- a secured personal loan (looks like ~5% but I've only looked at one bank's website)

- a loan against my 401k (4.5%, but only up to $50k)

I'm not sure what else I should consider. Ideas? The parameters are:

- minimize interest rate
- maximize loan amount 
- maximize term 
- the lender shouldn't be able to call the loan before the term so that I can ride out market lows

16-01-28,430s9n,Advice on (5WA.SI),"Hi guys, first and foremost let me give you a run down of my situation. First mistake: this is the first handpicked stock I bought in the Singapore Index sometime last year, when the price remains fairly flat at 0.30 per stock. Thinking that it is rather a good idea for investing in a healthcare stock (as people will always need healthcare), and so considerably cheap, I bought a bunch. 

Second mistake: a few months later, there have been news about speculators holding a large percentage of stocks in IHC and the Singapore exchange decided to halt trading for IHC for a period of time. After the halt, the price of stock tumbles from 0.30 to around 0.9. The young and optimistic me thinking that wow, for less than half the price I bought last time, I can get more than 2 times the amount. So I bought another bunch. 

So, after letting them sit for around a year and trading in US markets to gain experience, I decides to do something about them.

Here are my choices: 1. Since its the bear market and everythings going crazy, might as well buy MORE, and wait and see what might happen

2. Sell (stop losses?) and invest in others

For example, Apple, Kellogg, and John Deere have easy business models to understand and operate in relatively straightforward industries. Think you want to invest in that hot tech start-up that facilitates the creation of [backward overflow synergies](http://www.buzzpirates.com/2012/01/15-best-jack-donaghy-quotes-alec-baldwin-on-30-rock/)? Unless you have specialized industry expertise and know what that means, or you take the time to carefully study the company and industry first, you better stay away.

2. **Look for companies with favorable long-term prospects:** What is your company’s long-term competitive advantage? Does your company have a very wide and very sustainable “moat” that will protect its “castle” for years to come? Or will the company constantly have to re-dig its moat every year?

3. **Evaluate top management for honesty and competence:** Has the company or any of its executives been involved in fraud at any point in time? Is there “[key man](http://thelawdictionary.org/key-man-risk/)” (or key woman) risk? What would happen if the CEO or founder of the company left?

4. **Is the stock of the company at least reasonably priced:** What is the price of the company on the stock market and what do you think the intrinsic value of the company actually is? Is there a margin of safety, i.e. is the stock trading at a discount?

In regards to the requirements. When it comes to the initial margin requirement of 50% does this 50% need to be cash that goes towards the purchase or can it be account equity (other purchased securities). The way I read it I'm believe it would have to be cash given its my investment towards the purchase, but the maintenance requirement would only need to be equity and not have to be cash?

In regards to short sales I believe I'm understating that the 150% requirement at the time of purchase actually consists of 100% of the actual purchase (not existing equity in the account) and then then remaining 50% would have to be equity in the account not actual cash. The maintenance there after would be equity as well.

16-01-27,42xzsd,Income Generating Investments,"**Posted this in PF but feel you all may some insight for me in more specific investments/ options.**

Hello PF,

My financial house is in order and I'm looking for what is next. Here is some of my info so you can get a sense of my situation.

Age 22 Income: $58k Annual Debt: None Annual Expenses: 15k-20k Single Insured

**Emergency Funds:** I have two funds one for living expenses if I were to become unemployed and a fund for emergencies (medical, auto, etc…)

1) 6 months unemployment fund

2) $10k Emergency expense fund

**Retirement Accts.** Aggressive Portfolio: 40% Large US, 20% Small/ Mid Us, 20% International, 10% Bonds/ Fixed Income, 10% Other

1) Maxed Roth IRA

2) 10% of my income into pre-tax 401k (6% company match)

**Additional Savings:**

I have an account that I contribute to on a monthly basis for short term (1-5 year savings) for vacation, education, a new(used) car.

**So my question is, whats next?**

I have been going hard after my student loans and just finished them off. Since I don't wanna get frivolous with the extra money that wont be getting pushed over to my boys at Navient what should I do with it? My retirement accounts are pretty aggressive and I am looking for investments that are generally safe and will generate income over time through dividends/ distributions/ interest. Am I thinking in the right way? If not, than what? What investment products should I be considering?

Should I have two emergency accounts just in cash? I understand the importance of liquidity, and realize that inflation is not really a factor right now but I'd love to put a portion of it to work while still having them dedicated to their emergency purpose.
Thanks in advance. Lets have a discussion. If you see holes point them out and offer reasoning.",2

[One of the charts](http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/56a8c49058c32393008b5826-1059-601/screen%20shot%202016-01-27%20at%208.20.36%20am.png) shows that the median expected pay for those in a distressed credit strategy is north of $400,000.

Distressed debt involves buying the bonds of companies that are in or near bankruptcy. A lot of big name investors have been putting money to work in distressed debt, especially in energy distressed debt as they look for a bottom in the oil price collapse.

I have also recently discovered Robinhood, and it sounds right up my alley. Simple and to the point, which is unlike TDM and the TDM's complexity is what originally alienated me. But my main concern is that it can't be as simple and easy to trade as it sounds.

Can I actually buy a stock, wait for it to go up a bit, and then sell a few minutes later, free of charge, and no waiting period?

I guess my main question is can I buy and sell a stock at the click of a button at whatever price without paying a transaction fee?(obviously as long as there is a buyer/seller)

I've only put $200 in for now just until I've played around with the app a bit and have more confidence in its efficiency. Also if there are any catches or gimmicks or key differences from TDM in the trading process itself that I should know about, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE let me know! I very much appreciate and again I apologize for what I am assuming is a FAQ, but my money is on the line so I'd rather not use it on an app I don't fully understand.

16-01-27,42y3tg,Time to plan for AMZN earnings,"A lot of you seemed to appreciate my comment on how to have played NFLX earnings but I posted after it happened so trying to get ahead of the game here.  Please remember this is just my opinion, this is NOT a YOLO play its just a way to collect some cash on the earnings of a very high dollar, very liquid stock with high options volume.

1. Do not trade until after 3pm tomorrow.  AMZN is very volatile  (down $13 today) - if you don't see where it's going to settle going into earnings the ranges you set your options play at will be totally fucked

2. I'm playing an iron condor.  Why?  Because while there's a ton of money in other strategies, options market is pricing in a 15% move to either direction and because uncovered strategies like strangles are extremely expensive to trade on margin.  You're better off with a large number of covered contracts than a few uncovered contracts in terms of max probability

3.  IF we had to trade right now (again don't trade right now) I would personally trade a 490/495/680/685 IC for this Friday

This protects you 15% to either side

Why not wider wings?  Because if you go to $10 wide wings, you collect ~2x the premium but at ~2x the buying power.  Better to trade 2x the contracts with narrower risk 

If you're open to more exposure you could trade this same contract a week out for more premium

I'm open to all discussion on this and other opportunities people see here",24

16-01-28,432b31,Earnings Per Share (EPS),"Most of us have a thorough understanding of Earning Per Share. 

For those of you who do not know, Earnings Per Share is calculated by:
(Total Earnings) minus (The Dividends) divided by the (Total amount of shares)

Example: ($10,000) - ($2,000) / (1,000) = $8.00 a share.

Earning Per Share give speculators the ability to guage how well a stock had performed for either the last quarter or year.


Question: For a company that does not issue a dividen, the ask price is $60 and their EPS is $10. Does this indicate that the current price is undervalued?

If I were to take the ask price and divide it by the EPS does that give me it's current ROI?

Reasoning: 10/$60 = 16.66% ROI for the Company

If most people expect an ROI between 6% and 10%, does this give a good indication that the stock is undervalued?

I think data is USA only and in us dollars.  Obviously the value of the dollar plays a role.


Demand is up obviously but so is supply.  Why should the cost of pulling oil from the ground ever go up?  With new technologies things get cheaper.  If anything the value of oil will fall with time IFF oil supplies don't become exhausted, as I'm pretty sure is far out

My friend kept going and is still going today. He doesn't speak about it much but reckons he's made upwards of £2,000 in total to date.

Cash: 38.65%

REIT: 24.5%

ETFs: 18.4%

SWKS: 6.14%

GILD: 6.14%

NVDA: 6.14%

Let me know your thoughts on if this is a reasonable allocation of funds, if there's anything else I should be holding (gold/bonds/whatever), and if these individual stocks seem alright. I'm thinking about dropping NVDA and buying another ETF, but I haven't made my mind up on that yet.

However, with recent news of FATE

•Entering Phase 1 (not a huge deal) 

•FATE using part of their shelf (indicating _likely_ a larger extension of their current R&amp;D _beyond_ the JUNO collaboration)

•Takeda and Japan having a new interest in iPSC

A large buy out seems likely within the next few months.
Beyond that, I have heard things about NK (NantKwest) which is the only other major US Public company to be involved heavily in iPSC NK cell-lines is not spending much money on R&amp;D, instead, they are using their money for ""other things"".

I can only speculate, but I believe NK may use it's record-breaking IPO to acquire their R&amp;D, rather than build it themselves.

The Fed's decision comes with investors on edge due to a nearly relentless market decline since the last FOMC meeting. The statement did say the Fed was ""closely monitoring"" conditions.

A continued slide in oil prices, coupled with worries about a hard landing in China and weak economic data at home, have sent major U.S. averages into correction territory.

16-01-28,435m6p,Inherited IRA with crappy securities,"A 60 year old family member inherited an IRA worth around $100k. Per regulations, they must take RMDs until it is drawn down. This money can make a real positive impact on their life, so I want to keep it safe for them while still protecting against inflation.

Without going into too many details, this IRA was managed by, for all intents and purposes, someone who had no clue what they were doing. The IRA money is invested in high-fee funds, and high-risk (and poor choice) securities, like 3D printing stocks. I know, I know.

This Inherited IRA is at Morgan Stanley, and I want to move it into one or two conservative funds at Vanguard and just let it sit as it is drawn down over the years. I'd probably pick a low-fee bond fund, a low-fee total world stock fund, ~60/40 respectively, and rebalance once a year.

I am unfamiliar with how in-kind transfers work. Is there a way to change the securities the Inherited IRA is currently stuck with without selling all of it (and incurring a significant tax bill, since it is taxed as income for the inheritor, not gains, which would also bump them up a few tax brackets)?

16-01-27,42z81y,Have you ever wanted to see how hedge funds or commodity producers/users are positioned in the futures markets? Introducing Free CoT Data,"Hey r/investing, I've anonymously browsed this subreddit for a while and want to show you a new site I've made public. There's nothing in it for me (completely free, no ads, no signups), it's just a tool I've personally used for years that I think might help some other people out.

I spend a large amount of time analyzing how different types of traders are positioned. If hedge funds are super short the S&amp;P, if copper miners have fully hedged their future production, etc. I use something called the Commitments of Traders (CoT) report for this. The CoT report is released each week by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and reveals the trades made by different types of market participants.

Some people make the mistake of only looking up the current CoT report and seeing if a category like money managers are net long or net short. With this approach, you fail to get context for whether their current position is historically extreme or not. 

I like to identify historical extremes because it prevents me from entering into a crowded trade. If my other fundamental or technical analysis gives me a bias to be short the S&amp;P, but I check CoT data and money managers are more net short than they've ever been in the past five years, then maybe I should hold back on my short. Typically, when money managers get extremely short something, the trade gets crowded and has the potential for a violent short covering.

In addition, I like to know how commodity producers and users are positioned. These are the people who have a cash interest in the underlying commodity business. If I develop a long thesis on wheat, but I see that wheat producers &amp; users are in aggregate extremely net short wheat, I might want to avoid going long. 

Check out the ""How To Use"" page on the site to see how I analyze CoT data to make it actionable information. I'm happy to answer any questions in the comments section

If you were in my shoes, would you sell at market open monday for a loss of roughly ~$2,253, or would you continue to hold the shares - why or why not?

16-01-27,42zcpg,Question on options for 401k rollovers and extra money,"Ok, I haven't really posted many questions here, but I will be going through some changes and I believe now is the right time to ask. I posted in a thread yesterday and didn't get an answer. Here is some background info before the question:

Age: 25

Employment: Currently employed (3.5 years, same company), $70k/year income.

Objectives: Save for retirement, while building a liquidable amount to buy a house in the next 5 years.

Risk Tolerances: I'm young, I can stomach a loss if it happens. Would prefer to focus on growth at the moment.

Current Holdings: $13,212 (just started last year) in my company 401K, with the following: Dodge &amp; Cox Stock: 28%, Hartford small cap growth: 19%, John hancock income: 22%, T Rowe Price Blue chip: 31%. I feel like I have some bad elections on my investments, as I chose them without too much knowledge and may have lost quite a bit because of it (actual and opportunity).

Assets: $1.5k checking, $20.5k in savings (doing nothing but earning something like 20 cents of interest a month). Car is not paid off, still owe like $20k, paying $500/month on a $400 minimum payment, while throwing in extra money when I can. No credit card debt, no student loan debt.

What I am asking is help on what to do with my lump sum in my savings, as well as my 401K because my company has just switched to a different HR vendor and my options on rolling over the 401K to the new elections with the new company or taking a check and investing elsewhere seems overwhelming to me.
For my savings, I figured I would like to invest $6k of it into either a Roth, 401k, or stocks. I am not sure which one to choose, but I do know that I would like to contribute to this money and have it be the most liquid as I would hope to be able to build up enough with interest and contributions to put a down payment on a house with it (no budget yet, say a $20k DP for example). I am lost on what to do here, what to choose, who to invest with (firm wise), or what funds are best.

For my 401k, I am confused about my options. Would it be best to take a check from the old HR company and invest this on my own? Would I have to take a big tax cut out of it since this is untaxed money? Or, should I roll it over to the new company? I do not know the advantages and disadvantages of each.
Also, with the market down due to oil and China, what would be good sectors to research to put money in? Energy? Plastics? Manufacturers?

Probably a lot of info, I hope someone can make sense of it!",1

16-01-27,42zese,Best ways to take advantage of a declining real estate market,"So, I believe the real estate market, especially in my area, is near the top of a bubble.  I'd like to have some cash for when it bursts.  I don't own any real estate right now, so refinancing (now, while the market is high, rates are low) is not an option, and in any event, that still leaves the question about where to park the cash. 

Feel free to convince me I'm wrong, but I'd like to hear ideas about how to take advantage if/when the market goes down.  

I've considered shorting REITs or other RE-focused stocks, but I'm worried about carrying a short for a long time, and a similar problem lies with options. 

Are there simpler investment vehicles that typically rise with declining real estate in an area, or nationally (USA)?

What about other business opportunities that will do well when the market declines?

Other thoughts?

Thanks!",5
16-01-28,4339ii,Should the All Weather Portfolio be modified to time the market? (or does this already occur?),"Background: It is to my understanding that the All Weather Portfolio is constructed with capital preservation at its core, and based on a risk parity model which is extended to cover major economic scenarios. Basically, there are four large economic environments: periods of inflation/deflation and periods of growth/recession. Combining these together you end up with four major economic scenarios that will impact your investments. As it was presented to me, the portfolio seeks to risk adjust the weights so that it is 25% risk exposed to each of these combinations. Some basic portfolio elements that respond well in these scenarios are as follows (many more exist, but are not necessarily available to the average investor):

&amp;nbsp;

Growth/Deflation: Equities

Recession/Deflation: Bonds

Growth/Inflation: Commodities/REITs

Recession/Inflation: Cash/TIPS

&amp;nbsp;

What I am wondering is if you should modify your allocation to these positions based on your observation of the current market? For example, it does not appear to me very likely that we will see a large deflationary period in the near term. In this case, would you lower your allocations along the deflationary benefitting quadrants (equities/bonds)? The other side of this that I considered is that perhaps this is already captured with 50% of the risk skewed towards the deflationary side in that this less likely scenario should already be balanced in the risk parity equation.

&amp;nbsp;

Would appreciate hearing from anyone that has done some investigating into risk parity strategies.

It just seems so similar. It's well known the debt held by student loan borrowers is greater than that of credit car and even automobile debt. Also, virtually NO ONE gets denied a student loan. It's such a safe loan to hand out by the banks because it is backed by the US govt and you can't declare bankruptcy. 

But not being able to declare bankruptcy doesn't stop people from defaulting every single day. 

Is there something different about student loan debt that wouldn't effect the economy like mortgage debt if they aren't paid back??",9

Coming up first tonight, we've got the Bank of Japan policy announcement. There's some anticipation we may see further easing, since metrics are pointing to a huge undershoot of Kuroda's 2% inflation target. Statements have historically been released between 11:30 am and 12:30 pm Japan Standard Time, which is 9:30-10:30 pm on the East Coast and 6:30-7:30 pm on the West Coast. This statement could have material impact on the Nikkei 225 and on USD/JPY (although we've all hedged that risk, right guys?)

After market close at 3pm Japan Standard Time (1 am East Coast, 10pm West Coast), we are expecting Q3 TEPCO earnings. For those of you not familiar with their accounting habits, they don't break out quarterly performance, everything is always presented year to date. To get the quarterly numbers you need to subtract the values for the previous quarter, which you can find here: http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/corpinfo/ir/tool/presen/pdf/151029_1-e.pdf

Keep in mind that TEPCO's financial year starts in April, so Q3 is October-December. Also, TEPCO hasn't been very good about releasing the earnings in English in a timely fashion, so keep your Google Translate handy (if there are any native Japanese speakers around, your services would be much appreciated). [Here's the Japanese IR site.](http://www.tepco.co.jp/ir/index-j.html)

The patented VycidCast™ for ordinary income is **71 billion Yen**. If anybody else has got numbers let's get a consensus opinion going.

Here's some of the nitty-gritty:

October electricity sales: 19715190 MW-h

November electricity sales: 20177660 MW-h

December electricity sales: 22995780 MW-h

Oct-Dec electricity sales: 62888630 MW-h

Oct-Dec revenue projection: 1.327 trillion Yen

LNG price in October: $7.6 / MMBTU

LNG price in November: $7.4 / MMBTU

LNG price in December: $7.4 / MMBTU

I've been watching my portfolio drop for months and everybody is saying that this drop will last for all of 2016 and beyond. They say that the market may never go up a single day ever again for all time. That someday, stocks will be like rotten pieces of macaroni strewn around the streets of the worst ghettos in the world. Nobody will want to buy them. So why should I weather the storm and be the last one to realize that the world's economy has come to it's end. We're just a few years away from blowjobs being the primary currency.

How can the market ever go back up when every dollar in existence is owed as debt ten trillion times over? For every dollar in existence, there exists ten trillion dollars worth of debt. That dollar is worth negative ten trillion dollars. So one share of AMZN is actually worth negative 600 trillion dollars. By owning more than one share of amazon you owe the global economy quadrillions of dollars. You can't bitch when the share price drops to $0.001, becuase that just means you now only owe the global economy one billion dollars per share of Amazon that you hold.

Amazon is worth absolutely fuck all as a company because they don't make any money whatsoever. Everything you've ever bought on Amazon was just pushed from point A to point B by a little $5 robot thingy, that's all Amazon does, it pushes boxes from one pile to another. They are worth less than a single carpenter ant because they provide the exact same service, they just move things from one place to another. How much would you pay for a carpenter ant? $0.001 sounds much more reasonable than $700!

You think the market is rigged? I didn't think so when it was going up, oh those brief few months of euphoria when I first started investing, everything was going up. But I missed the bull run. I got on the train at the last stop before the apocalypse. Once I got on, it started slowing down, and I thought I could weather the dips, but it kept slowing down, and now it's going downhill fast. Is it rigged? Did ""they"" know that I got on? I think they might have known. I think ""they"" can see how many investors are ""smart money"" versus ""dumb money"" and as soon as a certain percentage of dumb money jumps onto the train, the smart money all jumps out, grabs their profit, watches the dumb money slowly jump out, then when the very last dumb money investor finally gives up all hope and sells... smart money jumps back on the train. Is it rigged? I still don't really think so, but I think it's possible that it's a little bit rigged.

16-01-28,433v09,"BRCM, AVGO merger?","Now that the outcome has been determined, but apparently not yet published, Does anyone know approximately what BRCM holders who did not make an election will get in the merger?  
  
Early news reports said those not making an election were equal to making an election of 50% cash and 50% stock.  But later news reports (which I think means more accurate) said non election was equal to electing 100% cash.  
  
Early news reports gave the cash and stock rates of the merger ($54.50 and .4378).  Later reports leave that out.  Are those still correct?  
  
The most recent news reports say the 100% cash election was only slightly oversubscribed, by an amount that should imply 94.52% cash, or imply each share of BRCM (that did not elect stock) would get $51.51 cash plus each 125 shares of BRCM would get 3 shares of AVGO.  If AVGO is $123 when your broker aggregates and sells the fractional 3/125 shares, the cash you get from that would be $2.95 per BRCM share, in addition to the $51.51 direct.  
  
If you had 42 or more shares of BRCM, you would get one or more whole shares of AVGO, that your broker would not automatically sell (with the fractional shares).  So that extra $2.95 per BRCM share is only on the part that isn't whole shares from the 3 AVGO per 125 BRCM.  

Is my understanding of all the above roughly correct?  Or did I miss something important?  (I'm not expecting either that $51.51 or the 3/125 to be exactly correct, just wondering if the logic is right making each of those nearly correct).",2

What would it be?,"[The Meyers-Briggs Type Inventory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator) is a self-report questionnaire designed to indicate psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions.  
  
There are 16 different types that are combinations of four dichotomies:
  
* Thinking/Feeling
  
* Introversion/Extroversion
  
* Intuition/Sensing
  
* Judging/Perceiving  
    
  

The test's scientific validity has always been questioned, but I think one can grant it lacks scientific rigor (falsifiability), while still allowing that reflecting on the way we think and how we reach decisions is useful-- especially in our investing lives.  
  
In the investing world, there seems also to be a diversity of types. I've heard of value investors and growth-oriented investors, for example. There must be many more. Do you think a test that identifies your investing type would be equivalent in some ways to the MBTI?  Are there any you know of?  
  
If we're thinking in terms of dichotomies, in investing there is/are:
  
* Active/Long Term traders
  
* Technical analysis/Fundamental analysis

Are there others that are analogous to the MBTI dichotomies?

  
I'm not that interested in ranking the various types from best to worst, because various ""types"" are suitable for different people. I find it more interesting to try to taxonomize the various approaches to investing so that a new investor could take a test and learn to contextualize his style amongst the others.",0

So here I am with my $1000. What would you suggest to buy?

After some research the 2 options that I currently have in mind are Ambarella and GoPRO.

Ambarella provides chips for the cameras installed in pretty much most of the emerging drones, and it is usually proposed as a great candidate for a steady rise over the next 2-3 years. It is however around $37 at the moment, I think it's a bit expensive. Side note: Ambarella gets about 30% of its revenues from GoPRO.

Then GoPRO. They are releasing their first drone in the first half of this year, I think they have a lot of potential to grow, and their stocks are cheap now (around $10). Some rumors about Apple wanting to buy it are also spread around the internet.

What do you guys think?

**Chapter 1: How did China's economic miracle happen**

Seriously, China's economic ""miracle"" is the most miraculous from when they lifted people out of poverty, but this ain't no miracle because if Mao didn't do communal farming and shit there wouldn't have been a poverty in the first place.  This is common knowledge.

OK moving on, next, economic figures. Very good, but this is just like a kid who used to suck at class started to work hard and get to the top.  Not uncommon.  Just ask any nong on the streets, the majority of them have this kind of experience in primary school.

The true miracle starts in 2001!

2001, China joined the World Trade Union.  The entire world opened to market all of a sudden. China facing a market so massive found it's own position and target: machining!

China has got a unique advantage in machining. First they have the numbers. Second they have the poors. Third they have nice guys(people easily bullied), last they have path leaders.  What do I mean ""path leaders""? Let's look at Asia's ""4 dragons"" of 2001, 2 out of 4 of the dragons are of Chinese heritage who are transitioning out of their machining trade phase, which leads to a lot of Hong Kong and Taiwan factory owners moving to China to continue their business, bringing in their entire operations to China, and thus, China takes off! In 10 years China has made it to be the ""world's factory"", where no other market can match China when it comes to machining! CCTV once made a program called ""Made in Dongguan"", in the program the reported pointed at a highway in Dongguan and said ""If this road is jammed for 30 minutes, the entire world's computer price will inflate!"" So proud, so arrogant, like they already control the fate of the entire world's economy! Citizens just need to grind hard, and they win! Simple? Yeah, it's that simple.  This is called ""won trick pony"".  The question is, why don't the others copy us?

They can't! Back in the days, our workers work continuous overtime, no social safety net, young work old fuck off.  Our lands can simply be confiscated, our pollution can go unchecked, we can even use taxpayer's money to help business owners to export through forex manipulation and government subsidy. This is the advantage China has and only China has, you can't do that! This is the advantage professor Qinhui call ""low human rights advantage""

That's the miracle.  Other countries are also massive, are also poor(India), but they can't do what China can do, they can't find their position in their market, they can't grow their market!  With this ""won trick pony"", China has made itself into the world's second largest economic region!

Of course, you can also argue that our class of 200 against your class of 20, of course we win everytime in terms of total school.  But does that mean we have good score per capita?

But look at it this way.  66 years ago, this is a class who spend all day sleeping and now it is a class who are actually putting effort in learning, so you can't deny us of our effort, kay?

This is the miracle.  At least compared with those Indian ~~pigs~~, China has contributed far more than India to the world economy!

16-01-29,4373d1,Anyone listen to the Visa investor call today? Management discussed a bit of the macro environment.,"Since I own 449 shares of Visa, I figure it was best to listen to the call since the stock rose in after hours after the quarterly report was issued but then promptly fell after the investor call. I listened to the first twenty minutes of the call, but picked up on some interesting tidbits: 

1. Brazil, Middle East and Russia had flat or decreasing payment volume.
2. Developed world was better in terms of payment volume growth.
3. Strong US dollar ripped 3% off net income.
4. Visa cardholders spent more during the holiday season compared to last year, both online and in brick and mortar. However, **people delayed their spending until close to the end of the holiday quarter**.

The call then shifted towards Visa's recent $16 billion debt issuance and the acquisition of Visa Europe, where I decided to stop listening to the call. 

This last point I noted in bold is huge to me. Even if people still spent money, they waited till the absolute last minute to do so. Despite lower gas prices and increasing employment, people are still extremely cautious about spending, probably due to the lack of wage growth.

I don't see a recession ahead, but growth is likely to be very slow for the next few quarters in the US. 

My main fear is that weakness in the stock market will eventually spill over into the consumer landscape, where deteriorating portfolio values encourage people to tighten their spending, which can cause layoffs, and from there, a minor recession that cascades. ",9

Very long term buy and hold.  I've only sold to rebalance.  I just dump more money into the market as an index fund or ETF every once in a while.  The closest I come to ""picking stocks"" is selecting among different styles of index funds, like SP500, emerging market, extended market, etc.  With my current style of investing, I would never rely on a portfolio of a few companies.

Still, if I were to pick stocks, there are some I would never invest in for long term.  This is either because I think the stocks are overvalued at current prices and will eventually decline significantly or because I have personal reservations about their business or business practices.

My concern is that when I buy new index fund or ETF shares, some small part of that money is going toward investing in companies I don't want to invest in.  Is there are way to effectively invest in an index but exclude certain companies?  The attractive thing about index funds isn't that they track an index but that they are a convenient way to easily diversify into many companies.  I'm fine if the fund diverges from the index over time since, with some companies excluded, it won't be as representative of the index as it normally is.

One possibility is to just look at the fund's holdings and buy the holdings one company at a time, excluding the ones that I don't want.  That's both time consuming and expensive from a commissions standpoint.  I wonder if there are any alternatives.",4

#Oasis Petroleum bonds rally, shares dip after follow-on equity sale

Oasis Petroleum bonds jumped, but shares slipped, after the Williston Basin producer announced a follow-on share offering to support general corporate purposes and current year capital expenditures. The 6.875% notes due 2022 were pegged seven points higher, at 60/62, while the 7.25% notes due 2019 gained the same amount, to 62/64, sources said, versus trades in blocks at 56 yesterday, data show.

Oasis announced a follow-on share offering for 34 million shares, raising about $160 million, according to a company statement. Citigroup is sole bookrunner, and there's a greenshoe option for another 5.1 million shares, the filing showed.

Shares of Oasis, which trade on the NYSE under the symbol OAS, dropped roughly 6% this morning, to $5.01 per share.

In addition to the equity sale, Oasis today reported preliminary fourth-quarter and year-end results. In addition to some production and capital expenditure data, the company reported that it ended the year with $138 million of borrowings drawn under a $1.525 billion RC, down from $180 million drawn on Sept. 30, 2015, according to the company statement. 

Recall that Oasis bonds were trading higher in the low 90s context over the summer after the company reported healthy second quarter results. See ""Oasis Petroleum bonds, shares trade higher after 2Q beats estimates,"" LCD News, Aug. 5, 2015. 

Oasis placed the $1 billion issue of 2022 senior notes in September 2013 at par, the middle of guidance, via a Wells Fargo–led syndicate. Proceeds were used to fund an acquisition of oil-and-gas assets in the Williston Basin for $1.45 billion. Ratings were B/B3 at offer, but are now B+/B2, with early 2014 one-notch upgrades on each side tied to higher valuation on reserves at the time and lower leverage.

Houston-based Oasis Petroleum is an independent oil-and-gas exploration and production company operating in the Montana and North Dakota regions of the Williston Basin. The company's market capitalization is roughly $690 million. — Matt Fuller

16-01-29,43a326,The Case for a Bear Market (US),"Basic catalysts/indicators:


1) Overvaluation. Schiller PE Index at 24.37 vs 16.65 mean. GDP growth (0.7%) is slightly north of anemic does not justify an earnings-growth reversion to mean, nor does the current (to-be-reported in the next few months) impact of low oil prices on energy stocks, and trickle-down effect on financials, consumer, housing. PE is higher than fundamentals and historicals justify


2) Emotional, not fundamental rally. Biggest driver of oil price rebound in the last two weeks was shorts covering. There has been no substantial, fundamental change in supply/demand dynamics to support a sustained bounce. Oil prices are below long-term equilibrium by at least $5-$10/bbl, but no near-term catalyst exists to support a reversal.


3) Fed rate increase: ~~The cancellation of the most recent hike is a suspension, and~~ at least one hike will occur before FYE2016, likely two. The end of QE coupled with interest rate increases, which are inevitable as the fed eases tension on the debt and equity bubbles, will drive down stock prices, *in addition to* placing pressure on a soft US economy, likely spurring a short-lived, minor recession. 

4) Corporate bond spreads are increasing. This indicates growing belief that credit conditions--and broader economic conditions--are set to deteriorate, a leading indicator for equity markets.  


5) BOJ: Just set interest rates negative. This couples a weak Yen with a weak Yuan, which hurts US exports, a major offset for any benefits manufacturers may experience from lower oil. 


6) Recent S&amp;P performance. Predictable pattern of exuberant growth, followed by a steep correction (seen in Dec/Jan), followed by upward correction (last two weeks), followed by full bear market decline. We're in a bull trap now, based on shorts covering, optimism decoupled from fundamentals, and once reality sets in, markets will plummet.

16-01-28,434ar7,Revealed: How much Google ($GOOG) paying Apple ($AAPL) to keep search Bar on iPhone? What about profits from Android?,"In 2014, Google ($GOOG) paid Apple $1 billion just to keep the search bar on the iPhone. Such data surfaced during the trial between Oracle ($ORCL) (capitalization of $ 43 billion) and $481 billion dollar giant Google ($GOOG).

Oracle’s ($ORCL) lawyer revealed a ten digit at the hearing, it served as a result of an agreement between Apple ($AAPL) and Google ($GOOG), as a percentage of revenue the search engine Google was working on the iPhone in 2014. At one point in the distribution of income it was 34% to 66%, but Google’s ($GOOG) lawyer appealed the hearing further disclosure of these percentages as they are tentative.

Oracle’s ($ORCL) lawyer was also operating the income figure from the Android OS, which totaled $31 billion, with net income of $22 billion. Thus, she raised the figures that have never been made public, and finds them “extraordinary scale of commercialism”.

Google asked the judge to keep under seal some evidence transcripts of the court, as “they are extremely confidential and public disclosure could negatively affect the company’s business».

By the way, Oracle ($ORCL) sued Google ($GOOG) in August 2010, stating that the Internet giant has violated the rights and patents Java, using them in Android OS. The Company assesses the damage and said they want Google($GOOG) to pay Oracle ($ORCL) $1 billion.",2

I'm currently 23 years old and trying to create a plan for investing for a house down payment. Roughly 10-15 years (I'm flexible) is around the time I am looking to purchase. I don't want to just park it in a savings account, I want it to grow at least a little bit. 

I will say upfront that I just started learning about investing other day. A week ago I didn't know what a brokerage account was, so bear with me.


I opened up a taxable account through vanguard and plan to DCA more or less $500-600 biweekly over the course of 10 or so years, taken automatically out of my paycheck. I'll increase that amount as raises and bonuses come.


As for the AA, I want to have mostly stocks, so I definitely want to include VTSMX and VGTSX. My rationale is that since I am not going to necessarily need the money for a while, I can afford to take on more risk. If the market for whatever reason tanked right when I needed the money, I would simply wait a few years for it to pick back up.


Now, my question for you guys -

Other than those two funds, how else should I diversify this account? I understand bond funds aren't tax efficient in taxable accounts. Should I go for something like VTMFX? 

Also, what would be the best plan of attack for rebalancing/withdrawing? How should I shift my AA over the years as I get closer to 10 years, and can I withdraw all the money in one lump sum? Or would it be more beneficial to withdraw it over the course of a year or so? 

*Note - not planning on using any of this account for retirement, I have a 403(a) that I'm maxing 6%, with employer match 4.5%, and a separate roth IRA that I'm maxing out.

16-01-28,434l7m,$F Equity Analysis,"Yay, another post on Ford. I'm going to open by saying that I've been a Ford shareholder for about a year now and I've lost... maybe 10%? That being said, I still believe - more now than before - that Ford is a strong buy. Why?


**Fundamentals**

Let's get this straight: Ford is not the best auto company in the world. I'm sure many of you would even argue that it's not even the best in America. Many other car companies have higher efficiency ratios, growth rates, stronger exposure to international markets, etc. That being said, it is the largest American car manufacturer by market cap and its assets are significantly undervalued. P/E of 5.95. Other P/something ratios significantly lower than the industry average. It's worth looking into. The fundamentals are certainly above average, but nothing extremely special. The only thing we care about at this point is *whether Ford will survive into the future*. Will it? Yes. Cool, let's move on. 

But what about its debt, you might ask. A quick visit to Yahoo Finance reveals that this company has a D/E of about 300 - 400%. Surely that can't be good! 

Most of this debt here is FINANCIAL SERVICES debt. Ford, as it turns out, has its own financial services wing to finance auto purchases. For financial companies, debt is absolutely critical; not to mention, all of this debt is backed by consumer and dealer purchases. This debt has an average interest rate of 0.5%. Not 5%; 0.5%. In terms of its automotive debt (bad debt), you'll notice that it's significantly lower. 


**Technicals**

[Chart](http://finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=F&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d&amp;s=l)
Ford's stock has hit a **double bottom** and RSI is sub-30. I don't know much about technicals but I do believe that this stock is heavily oversold. Today's negative price action is likely the result of yesterday being the ex-dividend date; people are dumping their shares after qualifying for the dividend. As the selling begins to wean off, we should expect to see a bounce in the short term unless the overall market shits itself in the next few days. Which, factoring in my luck, it probably will. 


**Dividend**

This is where it gets interesting. Ford currently has a dividend yield of 5.1%. Factoring in its special dividend, it has a dividend yield of **7.3%**. Remember that this is a large cap non-energy, non-REIT, and non-telecomm S&amp;P company. This is GOOD.

Recently, Ford announced that it would NOT be raising its regular dividend and would issue a special dividend instead. GM instead announced a dividend hike and increased share buybacks. Which is better? You're wrong. It's Ford. But why? Why, you might ask. If the company truly believed in its future, then wouldn't it hike its dividend obligation?

Ford does NOT believe in its future. This is a GOOD thing. Ford's stock is divided into two types of shares, Class A and Class B. Class B shares have 40% voting power and the Ford family owns 100% of these OP shares. When sold, Class B shares turn into Class A shares, reducing their voting power. As such, there is no incentive for them to ever sell their Class B shares.

Why do people buy stocks? They want return on capital; they want to either sell their stock at a higher price than purchased or to get dividends. Since Ford's family probably will not sell significant portions of their Class B shares, they will seek return on capital through dividends. 

Remember 2008 - 2009? I don't. According to the internet though, this was bad. The Big 3 auto companies nearly all went down, with GM being owned by the US Treasury for some time and Chrysler being sold to Fiat. Ford was the only company to make it through without any government intervention (yay). I'm sure the Ford family remembers this, and expects that they cannot continue to post record profits in the future. Since automobiles are an incredibly cyclical commodity, a market recession (heyyyy 2017/2018 hype) will result in lower sales. GM, who has raised its dividend, will struggle to meet its obligation. It'll either have to cut its dividend or make cuts elsewhere, neither of which will be greeted by shareholders. Enter based Ford. Ford issues special dividends in good times and maintains a sustainable dividend. Ford does not cut its regular dividend. Be like Ford. 

I strongly believe that Ford will continue to issue special dividends in the future when times are good, and I expect to see another in late 2016/early 2017. When times get bad in the future, Ford can merely trim its special dividend and maintain its freaking 5.1% regular dividend. Either way, it's a win-win. This is a perfect income stock for the long term, and it's trading for an EXCELLENT price right now. 

I'll also be editing this post with a comprehensive analysis doc shortly! Agree, disagree? ",61

16-01-28,434qnc,Interesting View on Portfolio Construction,"Hi all, I work for a large University endowment as an intern in the Office of Investments. Since the office is small, I get to learn a lot about investing (both in private and public equities) from very experienced professionals. I thought I'd share my boss' opinions on portfolio construction, which IMO are very unique and present a different way of thinking about assets. 

Portfolios need to beat their benchmarks over long periods of times. The question is obviously how do we achieve this? One way of thinking about this is to assume, over the long-run, that the benchmark has a constant proportion of ""good times"" and a constant proportion of ""bad times"". To achieve alpha the portfolio must either outperform the benchmark during the good times, or outperform during the bad times, but not necessarily both. For example if a portfolio captures 50% of the downside and 100% of the upside, then we can reasonably expect this portfolio to outperform given enough time. The same would be true if the portfolio captures 100% of the downside and 150% of the upside.

With this in mind, portfolios should adjust their downside/upside captures over time. Coming out of recession, the portfolio should target 100/120 (downside/upside). As the years pass, the portfolio should gradually shift towards 80/100. You may argue that this is timing the market, but I disagree because this approach advocates shifting towards 80/100 even in the face of a raging bull market.

The obvious question is how do you construct a portfolio that will capture x% of the downside and y% of the upside? That's a much more difficult question, especially for the retail investor, and should perhaps be saved for another time. ",3

16-01-28,434r7t,The Case for Apple(warning:long!) - iPhone,"
** *The iPhone**

Apple goes as the iPhone goes and the flat increase in both revenue and units sold is obviously not going to be taken as a good sign of future prospects. This combined with the lean revenue projection for Q2 has sent the stock tumbling recently. 

There's no denying the fact that Apple sales are slowing. Next quarter, Apple will likely show a quarterly revenue decline for the first time since 2003 and will also probably show a quarterly iPhone unit sale decline for the first time ever. 

The concern here is that the iPhone is reaching a saturation point in the developed countries. Combine that with slowing growth in important emerging markets such as China and you’ve got an issue. Sure, there are other markets like India which is showing solid growth on a % basis but that’s still a tiny fraction of the overall bucket and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. If this is peak iPhone then have we really seen Apple at its best or can Apple get back on track and continue to impress in the future?  To figure out the answer to that – we need to look at what makes the iPhone desirable and whether or not we’ve reached a point where that desire is satiated. 

** *The iPhone market**

First, let's take a step back and take a look at the worldwide smart phone market and how the iPhone ties into it. As of 2015, iPhones represent about 12-15% of the overall phone market which is expected to more than double in size by 2020 led by primarily by growth in emerging markets like India and China and other smaller countries. IDC is projecting that annual phone shipments will reach 2B/yr by 2019 from a high of 1.5B in 2015. This is projected to be driven by small increases in 2016 and 2017 then a bump in 2018. 

These projections may seem bullish but you have to consider the opportunities that are out there in the global market for growth. 

China has 93 mobile phone connections/100 citizens. That seems pretty saturated but only 50% of the population used smart phones as of 2015. India has 79 connections/100 citizens but only 26% of the population had smart phones. These two are the biggest target markets out there but there are plenty of other potential markets to expand into that offer similar potential growth. These are not outliers either as even Central and Eastern European countries like Russia, Poland and Turkey sport smart phone penetration rates that represent about 55% of the overall mobile users with prediction showing those numbers rising to the 70% range by 2018.  

On the opposite of that end is the US. The problem with Apple in America is that the US smart phone market has become saturated with fewer first-time buyers. The smart phone penetration growth has been quick in the US as evidenced by the great growth in earnings for Apple. In December 2013, only 65% of mobile users owned a smart phone. That number grew to 75% by the end of 2014 and was around 85% by the end of 2015. That means the US as a smart phone market is not going to be driven by first-time buyers in the near future as we reach a full saturation point. 

There are no actual numbers but it is likely that these late adopters (I included myself here) are also more likely to hold their phone for a longer period of time and might not be as good a source of recurring revenue as the early adopters. 

Now this creates potential problems from Apple. The first is that the US is a source of nearly 40% of their revenue and if it is near a peak then future growth rates will certainly be affected unless they can really capitalize on growth in those emerging markets we talked about.

The second is that the US market is already pretty saturated with the iPhone. If the first time buyer market is shrinking then the natural solution is to either poach second time buyers who don’t own an apple iPhone or make current iPhone owners upgrade more often. Let’s talk about the first strategy before we talk about the second as that will be discussed later.

The current iPhone US market share is about 44% - a pretty sizable chunk when you consider the variety of players in the smart phone market. However, when you compare it by OS(operating system), iPhone is second behind Android which is the primary OS in most competitor’s phones. 

If we posit that first time buyers are becoming rarer then the best way to grow market share is to get Android users to convert so the question becomes – is Apple capable of doing that?  Apple themselves must be aware of this as they’ve recently released an app on the Google store allowing easier conversion from Android to iPhone but how successful will this strategy be in the long term and how many people are actually willing to switch OS? 

There was some good information in the Q4 call from Tim Cook where he claimed that over 30% of their iPhone sales were from Android switchers. There were no numbers this quarter but Tim Cook did say that Q1 had the highest level of iPhone switchers by far. This sounds great but is it really as great as Apple makes it out to be?

While iPhone market share in China and the US has remained relatively constant against Android, it has shrunk worldwide in recent months. Why is that the case and does it matter? 

The simple conclusion is that Apple’s long term strategy of premium product at a premium price has reached a saturation point in certain markets where the price point is simply not affordable or not enticing to first time phone users. This limits their uptake of those users in those markets and will limit their earnings potential in the near-term as late adopters in mature markets go for the cheaper options as do those who can’t afford Apple’s price point in emerging markets. 

On the other end of the spectrum is the existing iPhone user and I’m not worried at all there as Apple has one of the highest brand loyalties in the industries. They’ve also done an amazing job of making an entire integrated Apple universe that can effectively tie a user to Apple products much better than any Android device has so far. But Apple can’t simply thrive on the existing iPhone user for reasons I’ll discuss later so we need to make sure that they don’t leave the emerging markets and first-time buyers behind and I think they’re at a point where they might just be doing that. 

That is at least in the short-term. I’m not surprised by the reduction in projected revenue in the near term. The economies of some of the important emerging markets are slowing and the currency issues will be at the forefront for at least the next year or two but the question is whether Apple can get past it and return to revenue growth in the future and I think the answer to that is yes.

And in order to figure out why – we need to visit the iPhone itself as a product and see what it offers that others do not.

16-01-29,43anjs,The Best Stock Over the Last 30 Years? You’ve Never Heard of It,"From the WSJ:

The best-performing U.S. stock over the past 30 years isn’t a household name like Costco Wholesale Corp. or Johnson &amp; Johnson. It’s Balchem Corp.BCPC +2.61%, up 107,099% since the end of 1985, according to FactSet Research Systems.

You’d never heard of Balchem? Me either; stocks don’t come much more obscure than this. Based in Wawayanda, N.Y. (population 7,266), about 70 miles northwest of New York City, Balchem makes flavorings, fumigating gases and nutritional additives for animal feed. Its total stock market value is about $1.7 billion.

Since the end of 1985, Balchem has gained an average of 26.2% annually, compared with 10.3% for the S&amp;P 500 and 15.7% for Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

You shouldn’t drop everything and buy the stock. The top-performing companies of the past three decades aren’t likely to remain the best in the decades to come. And with flattening profitability and shares at a lavish 27 times earnings, Balchem looks expensive for now.

(The company said no one was available to comment by press time.)

But you can learn from Balchem and its peers for free. Over the past 30 years, 44 U.S. stocks generated cumulative total returns of 10,000% or more, according to FactSet. The 10 behind Balchem are Home Depot Inc., Amgen Inc., Nike Inc., UnitedHealth Group Inc., Danaher Corp., Altair Corp., Kansas City Southern, Jack Henry &amp; Associates Inc., Apple Inc. and Altria Group Inc. All grew by at least twice the rate of the S&amp;P 500. Investment manager William Bernstein of Efficient Frontier Advisors in Eastford, Conn., has christened such companies “superstocks.”

Perhaps the most notable thing they share, says David Salem, chief investment officer at Windhorse Capital Management in Boston, is that “they have all undergone at least one near-death experience.”

Jack Henry, which provides technology services to banks, lost more than 82% of its market value between 1986 and 1989. Apple’s stock fell by 79.6% between 1992 and 1997 and ultimately underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by a staggering 771 percentage points.

“Just think about that minus-771 number,” says Mr. Salem. “There are no investment professionals in the world who bought Apple 30 years ago and held it continuously ever since — except liars.”

Balchem shows the patience, grit and good luck it takes for a company to turn into a superstock.

The firm began in 1967 as a specialty-chemicals company that made ingredients for hairspray and ink, among other things, says Raymond Reber, who stepped down as chief executive in 1997.

In 1996, Balchem was losing so much on a new technology to coat nutrients that “it was crazy,” says Mr. Reber. “We couldn’t operate that way.” So, he recalls, he told the company’s factory workers, “‘You have to figure out a way to double our production without raising our costs.’ And they did it.”

But the transition was rough. Balchem’s shares dropped 57% in 13 months between late 1997 and the end of 1998.

Dino Rossi, who was Balchem’s chief executive between 1998 and last year, remembers a staff engineer pointing out long ago that its nutritional choline salts might have a nonfood purpose: to help stabilize clay deposits. Years went by before fracking for oil and gas created a bonanza for that use. The end result: tens of millions of dollars in revenue for Balchem.

You never know for sure where good ideas will come from,” says Mr. Rossi, “and it doesn’t happen overnight.”

It took years for Balchem to perfect microcapsules that could survive the harsh acids of a cow’s first stomach and then release nutrients farther along in the animal’s digestive system. “You have to be constantly working the technology harder,” says Mr. Rossi.

Can only a professional stock picker pluck a company like Balchem out of obscurity? The stock didn’t attract a single major institutional holder until 1999, even though it had returned an average of 21.3% annually over the previous decade. And the odds that any professional investor would hang on to such a stock while it fell 57% are nil.

Investment professionals often ridicule index funds — those autopilot portfolios that mechanically own every stock in a market benchmark — for holding overpriced stocks and riding them all the way down. But one of the unsung virtues of index funds is that, by design, they cling to their holdings through even the worst downdrafts.

Balchem has been included in the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index since 1986 and appears to have been held by index funds since at least early 1998.

When companies decline 50% to 80%, index funds won’t sell them. Most stock pickers will, however. If some of those companies bounce back and turn into superstocks, index investors get to go along for the full upswing.

In the long term, capturing the full upward sweep of a superstock requires enduring several near-death experiences along the way. That’s reason No. 147 why, for most people, index funds make superior sense.",130

16-01-29,438247,"How does Kellogg's valuation make sense?","I'm not saying it doesn't, I'm just saying I don't understand it.

$72.79/share.  Dividend is $0.50 per quarter.   PE around 72.

Quarterly earnings are around $225M per quarter for the past 5 quarters except one quarter was -$293M because of an extra $500M in the ""Expenses"" column.  So let's say the next 4 quarters are, optimistically, an average of $230M (and there shouldn't be a holiday bump, right?).  That would give a forward PE of around 25.  

Sure 25 isn't sky high but how is Kellogg anywhere in growth range?  Kellogg owns a good chunk of the cereal market and has a lot of popular snacks.  Those markets are pretty much going to grow with population.  And as far as companies vying for market share...breakfast is part of a routine that a lot of people do half asleep and IMHO a lot of people don't change that routine very often.  

I guess what I'm really getting at is what is a reasonable PE for a company that is very old, stable, a household name, popular with all ages, a staple in many peoples' lives but not doing anything revolutionary.

Hmmm...just had a thought... Is there an expectation that companies like Kellogg which move a huge volume of low cost goods will benefit a lot from low oil prices?",2

For the first time, the social network highlighted ad blocking technologies as a significant risk factor in its annual 10-K filing, noting that they have impacted its ad revenue ""from time to time.""
Although Facebook mentioned ad blockers in its 10-K last year, too, it did so only briefly as one of many things that could potentially impact its ads businesses, whereas it dedicated a whole section to the technology this time around. 
The warning about ad blockers comes as Facebook delivered blockbuster fourth-quarter financial results and as its ad business appears to be firing on all cylinders.
Ad-blocking software, which nixes display advertising from websites, became a hot topic last year after an Apple operating-system update allowed ad blocking on iPhones and iPads for the first time.
Facebook makes about ~96% of its revenue from advertising, so if more people started using ad blockers on all of their devices, it could ""adversely affect"" Facebook's financial results.

16-01-30,43fc9x,Flint’s water supply failure was brought on by excess protection of municipal workers’ benefits?,"&gt; The story of Flint, Mich., is not only the story of dirty water and derelict environmental officials that has dominated the news. The unsung story is that of imprudence that made some sort of catastrophe almost inevitable.

&gt; Flint changed its water supply to save money. In the process, it failed to add chemicals that would prevent the new, more acidic water from eroding lead from ancient city pipes supplying as many as 100,000 people. 

&gt; At bottom, however, it’s not a water crisis; it’s a benefits crisis. Flint’s money shortage came about largely from high municipal pension obligations and a retiree health plan that could not be properly funded after the biggest taxpayer, General Motors, moved out. 

&gt; The city’s population shrunk, the city budget shrunk, and wages shrunk, but benefits for retirees could not shrink because of protections in the state constitution. Currently, pensions and retiree health care consume 33% of general fund expense and 20% of all city spending. The city has been in receivership since December 2011.

&gt; Flint is not the first victim of excessive municipal benefits—and it won’t be the last.

Most of the subprime mortgages that precipitated this crisis were interest-only adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) set to start ballooning at either the five-year or seven-year mark.

16-01-29,438kzn,[Advice] Wanting to get started into rental investment properties and looking for experienced advice,"hello everybody,
I am currently 25 years old and serving in the military on active duty. My plan is to invest in mutual funds for the next 12 years until I can retire from active duty military and then buy a duplex, triplex, or apartment complex with whatever cash I am able to invest up to that point. I am hoping to find some people who have had some success as well as failures in this community to guide me towards the do's and donts of investing in real estate.

- best communities to invest in?
- what is the best type of property to initially invest in?
- how much cash or percentage of money do you recommend having in an account for each rental property as maintenance money?
- who do you go to for rental rules and regulations in your location?
- how do you write up your leases for tenants?
- how do you decide how much to charge the tenants?


Above are just a few questions that I am currently researching. This is something that I have years to plan and would like to get as much information as possible from those of you who have experienced this type of investment. Thanks for any advice you can provide.

16-01-29,438r4c,"It sucks to lose money, but it will make you a better investor.","Over the next few weeks, I plan to offload a lot of stocks I bought way back when I didn't do as much research or due diligence as I do now. 

They are UNP, STX, and UTX. 

Why am I selling them? Macro weakness notwithstanding, I bought them simply because I read some bullish articles on SA over a year ago without doing much else due dilligence. 

I will realize a capital loss of over $2,000 for this. But it is fine. Along with my recent speculation loss on DWTI, I am happy to be losing money now rather than later. Plus, I can write this stuff off on my taxes.

I also plan to offload AAPL, MSFT, and INTC. They have had a great run, and will serve to offset my losses. 

I guess I'm writing this post because I want to tell people that it's okay to lose money, so long as you roll with what you have learned from the loss. For me, I wasn't paying enough attention to what I was investing in. Don't be a bag holder and hope that shit comes back up, because it might not for over ten years and you might just be sitting on dead money. 

Don't buy too many individual stocks. Too many individual positions causes decision fatigue and increases the likelihood that you won't do as much due diligence as you should. For the stocks you do buy, make sure to listen to the earnings calls and make sure that you know what kind of ""story"" about the company you are buying into. Even if you don't know much about valuation, you should learn enough to look at ratios and look at an income statement/cash flow statement to see if a company is actually earning money. See what the revenue trends are like over the past couple of years. 

That said, I'm not too upset. I realized thousands of dollars of capital gains and dividends last year. A lot of the stocks I have sold last year are now sitting right at where I bought them for. 

What will I buy with the money I get? I think a minor recession is in the cards. I will probably add to my position in VZ. Probably get into bonds again. ",53

16-01-30,43g4sy,GAAP earnings vs reported earnings,"I'm looking at some somewhat random stocks (screened based on some criteria) and one in particular has a huge disparity between their reported earnings and what the broker website says was their GAAP earnings.

For example, in 2015 they reported earnings of 1.47 per share, but according to GAAP (in the SEC filings), they would've *lost* 31 cents a share. 

This has been going on for at least the past 3 years... they report a profit, but according to GAAP, they should be losing money.

I understand sometimes companies will use pro forma EPS to gloss over one-time, non-recurring expenses, but is it normal for it to be *that* far off every quarter and every year?

Is this necessarily a warning sign that something is up? Or can an argument be made that their version of accounting is more ""accurate"" than GAAP?

Will I need a degree in accounting to truly appreciate the difference? (I'm in a ""fundamentals of accounting"" course now, but I didn't intend to take it much further than that).",1
16-01-29,43bjih,Shorting TRXC,"   This is my opinion on why shorting TRXC is a good choice right now.  My First reason is the fundamentals are terrible (I mean this in a good way). The gross margin is -224.63%, operating margin is -30,052.51% EBITDA margin -25,748.51%, net profit margin is -30,921.34%. These are some of the worst margins I have ever seen in a company, and i doubt any investor would invest in it based on these statistics alone. The next variable to consider is management effectiveness. It has a -20.05% return on assets, a -25.69% return on equity, and a -21.09% return on investment capital. In addition to this the company also negative cash flow and it lost money the past several years. Its dividend is nonexistent and has an EPS of -.58.
   In addition to all of this TRXC spiked recently, and I believe it will fall back to where is was previously before the spike. For all these reasons I will be investing in it. I am eager to hear feedback on this as this is my first time analyzing a company in this way.
   All of the information used for this analyzation was taken from E*Trade.

5. Saving Deposit @ 5% - £4000

16-01-30,43bv86,Obvious questions about Tesla and why no one takes these factors into consideration,"So right now Tesla is really down in the dumps because of lack of Model X sales. Clearly the SUV is very expensive and I personally am not surprised that it didnt sell as well as the Model S. 

Here are the factors:

1) Model 3 is coming in March, rumors of model Y being announced with it. 

2) Oil prices will go up again 

3) Oil isn't forever, we have to start depending on electricity

4) Tesla is opening up a major factory in China 

5) Tesla's Model S is the highest sold luxury Sedan currently, and Model 3 is suppose to dominate the average market. 

6) Most importantly Tesla is to cars what iphone was to cell phones, and with the whole autonomous innovation, summon, and all these tech movement forward is something to look out for. 

Also all other electric cars are absolutely horrendous compared to the Telsa, the only thing other cars got on Tesla is the price, which they will also lose when the model 3 comes out in March.

From the BBC:

In the mid-1990s, David Bowie, his financial manager Bill Zysblat, and banker David Pullman came up with a new scheme to generate cash from Bowie's extensive back catalogue.
In 1997 Bowie sold asset-backed securities, dubbed ""Bowie bonds"", which awarded investors a share in his future royalties for 10 years.
The securities, which were bought by US insurance giant Prudential Financial for $55m (£38m), committed Mr Bowie to repay his new creditors out of future income, and gave a fixed annual return of 7.9%.",5

SGNL is executing on its market plan.  The big reason this stock fell is that the MyPRS test took much longer to gain acceptance and generate revenue than expected.  Initial revenue came from a grant UAMS.  This funding has been dwindling the past few quarters.  However, the real money, hospital growth has seen steady adoption year over year (an increase of 82% growth).  [I expect there to be even larger growth in Q4 because of agreements with PPO networks that were initiated in Q2 and Q3 with 133 million patients covered.](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AMDA-2OH8PD/1372381313x0x867849/6854F209-EBA8-47F6-BAC3-BC80E25CBB53/SGNL_Fact_Sheet_-_December_2015.pdf)

What PRs will lead to a price increase over the next 2 months?

* Earnings will be out within 3 weeks.  Further establish cash value and adoption trend.
* They will be announcing a new product in Q1, I think this will be a big catalyst.
* There should be ongoing updates about the 200 person trial at the University of Texas.  This product is an assay not a drug, so results are much more fast-paced.
* SGNL may (this is just pure speculation) also divulge their major pharmaceutical partner as well.
* I expect signal to increase PR and promotion to ensure the stock hits $1 and stays there for 10 consecutive days for Nasdaq compliance. 

Risks

* This is a low volume, high volatility microcap stock.
* Some people think the Chairman of the Board is a scumbag…  Maybe, but he has a personal tie to this company because of his wife.
* The entire biotech sector is very down right now (this might be a positive if you expect a rebound soon)


TLDR;
Neat biotech company with a product that works.  Increasing hospital revenue streams.  Trading below cash value.  New product soon.  Short term increase of 70-100% (2-6 wks).  Long term increase of 200-500% with revenue from increased adoption.  High volatility, low volume.  YOLO

“No way, Facebook.”

In a patent application published today—first surfaced by the legal technology firm ClientSide—Facebook outlines a system for setting up carpools for people attending the same event.

Facebook already allows users of the social network to set up events, and integrates maps from HERE—the former Nokia map product that was recently sold to a group of car makers—with directions on how to get to the event. But Facebook’s patent application goes a step further: For future events, you’d potentially be able to select what mode of transport you’re planning on taking to get there, and team up with others who want to get there the same way.

Sounds sinister enough that the mass media (who need new buzz words after absolutely exhausting every ounce of news related to Zika over the weekend) will run with it. 

So far only two direct stocks with exposure to Zika. First up my main man $INO, who I pumped last week and gained 25% on - they say they will have a human vaccine ready for emergency use this year and the media loves it. They may just get some government funding because they are first movers. 

Other stock who has been in the news is XON who owns a company that makes MUTANT MOSQUITOS and who just opened up a factory in Brazil to make EVEN MORE MUTANTS. What could go wrong? Well, their share price for one - it had a small pop last week, but then basically went back to square one. Maybe because some say these mutant mosquitos are the reason why Zika, that was harmless earlier, gives babies small heads. Might still be a good YOLO after the WHO meeting though.

Thousands of New natural gas wells drilled. At any moment America can ramp up NG production if the price allows.


https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/how-us-lng-production-will-ultimately-exploit-global-markets 


Yes this article is old. 

   But it does a decent job explaining that USA exporting natural gas important for its geo political agenda. As we hedge the LNG market we take away market share from our global competition like RUSSIA.  The USA has a goal of supplying LNG to most of Europe, taking away market share from Russia.  Thus weakening Russia as a whole, and hurting the unification of BRICS

After events In the Ukraine, Europe has seen the cost of diversifying their Natural gas imports, and getting away from purely relying on Russia and other middle eastern shits.


Fukishimia caused a major uproar in the import of LNG.  But now as nuclear reactors go back online LNG imports have decreased.  But the lingering fear has not stopped other nations from getting away from nuclear.

Germany plans on shutting down all of its reactors by 2022, and supplementing with natural gas and coal.  

http://www.theenergycollective.com/robertwilson190/328841/why-germanys-nuclear-phase-out-leading-more-coal-burning


The last global warming energy summit, paris 2015. One of the main points was for Natural gas conversion of coal power plants in 1st world countries, and the construction of natural gas power plants in developing nations. 


We are going to see a global surge in the use of Natural gas for many reasons.  Even the downstream industry is going to be using natural gas instead of oil for creating polymers, feedstock, and expensive aromatics.
http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Natural-gas-to-1-gasoline-5701521.php

http://engineering.stanford.edu/news/how-methane-sourced-polymers-could-save-world

Sassol and Marathon are leading the way in Units that can do this.  

http://theadvocate.com/news/11451337-123/sasol-delays-14-billion-fuel

Echo 1 was already built ECho 2 is going up

Marathon is more secret about their stuff. You gotta go hop on a turnaround to figure out whats happening.

GTL plants will be going up all over the world.



America is a huge producer of NG, with many proven reserves.  We have drilled thousands of wells that can be used at a moments notice, around 15-22 days to become operational.  If the market conditions allow.  There will be a massive commitment to NG infrastructure.  From coal burners being converted, to refinery operations using NG instead of oil to create refined product, to Political entities trying to diversify their Geographical hedge and diversifying their energy grid. 

Natural gas is the next  long term huge play.  Among marijuana, and maybe others.  The question finding the outfits that will out compete.  

During the computer race, many hedge funds collapsed because they could not find proper companies to invest in... while others only put 3% in IBM. IBM came out on top.

We can apply this to the natural gas market.  weather you are going to invest in upstream, midstream, or downstream plays.

From GTL tech, To LNG export and import TECH, to Midstream pipeline, and LNG shipping vessel tech.

LNGLY or LNGLF looks very promising. They are the same

  They have secured contracts with Kinder Morgan thus have a constant NG supply and are very close to Midstream infrastructure.  Their contracts are legally binding.  KBR, and Simens have procured the construction and ENG contracts and equipment supply. LNG limited is also backed by some very nice hedge funds.

 The future demand for Natural gas looks handsome as it is to becomes the worlds next coal and oil as we fear global warming and get better at our hydrocarbon chemistry , our use of coal and oil will slump.  

They also own their own LNG process tech. Called OSMR 
So when their projects do break ground.  Their overhead will be much less compared to other LNG projects.
  LNG limited owns Magnolia LNG.  There is much competition in the future LNG export biz.  The competion is world wide, but also very thick in the USA.  But when you compare Magnolia LNG, to other proposed sites, they are the furtherest ahead in permitting from FERC, EPA, and other entities. They also have a steady supply of gas.  Many other proposed projects sounds nice and fancy but do not even have a pipeline near by!

With that in mind, what is the best way to approach paper trading? Should I try a single trading strategy with solid reasoning and work and improve on it (any suggestions for a starting point?). Should I do a lot of fundamental analysis and try and pick for value (I've got one year so very long term value plays might not be the best option).

#1   U.S. Dollar is a Crowded Trade

* U.S. dollar sentiment among western investors has become close to unanimously bullish. The Bernstein
Daily Sentiment Index for the U.S. dollar registered a 90% bullish reading on 1/5/15.  Somewhat counter-intuitively, I believe that the Federal Reserve will be unable to continue its supposed tightening cycle meaningfully and the Federal Reserve will ultimately have to reverse course, giving more easing to the markets.  If the Dollar fails to go higher, expect gold and commodities to catch a bid.

#2   Foreign Demand for U.S. Treasuries is Declining

* Foreign demand for Treasuries has collapsed in recent quarters, despite persistently wide spread-premiums
to competing global sovereigns.  The U.S 10-Year note is yielding much higher compared to German, Italian, and other 10-Year.  Nations around the world, notably China, are mass selling U.S treasuries at a rate unseen since 2001.

#3  U.S. Credit Cycle is contracting

* High-Yield Debt has been deteriorating for the past year and is really start to pick up.  I believe credit stress is not contained to just the energy sector and is spreading to all industries.  High Yield has not been this distressed since Lehman brothers announced bankruptcy.   Junk spreads, TED spreads, and LIBOR spreads are all trading at ridiculously wide margins.

#4 The US &amp; major industrialized nations are entering a recession.  

* The U.S is already in an industrial recession by many measures and I believe it is only a matter of time until the mainstream media has to accept this ugly fact.  Recent readings for industrial production, construction spending, factory orders, retail sales, housing starts and existing home sales have been disappointing consensus.  The industrial sector is already in a recession, the retail sector of the economy is perhaps already there, it is only a matter of time until the recession bubbles up to the corporate sector and harms corporate growth (already happening).

#5  U.S. Equity Markets are Overvalued 

* By most measures, U.S equities are historically overvalued.  During the past 135 years (figure below), the CAPE ratio
has only been higher on three occasions: 1929, 2000 and 2007.

#6  Gold Experiencing Bullish Divergences

* During the past three months, important technical indicators in the gold complex are signaling the most important divergence of the past 15 years. Since late-November, spot gold has set three separate closing 52-week lows uncon  rmed by all broad gold
equity averages (GDX, GDXJ, XAU, HUI), a development which has not transpired since 2001.  If Gold can hold above $1,000 for the next several months, we may find a bottom.

#7 Demand for Physical Gold is Skyrocketing

*  The Shanghai Gold Exchange, which has eclipsed the London Bullion Market Association as the
world’s leading physical gold marketplace, reported 2015 physical withdrawals of 2,596.4 tonnes, a new
annual record.   Similarly, Indian imports for 2015 are on course to exceed 1,000 tonnes, an 11% increase over 2014 levels (not
including smuggling totals estimated in the hundreds of tonnes). Given prospects for extended volatility in
both the yuan and rupee, I believe domestic gold demand in China and India will set a durable
price floor in future periods.

* The continued strength of physical gold buying will prevent prices from falling much further, as it becomes clear that a core group of investors is sticking with the market.

* U.S. demand for gold bars and coins surged 207% during the third quarter.  The U.S. Mint backs up that assessment. It said gold Eagle coin sales surged to nearly 400,000 ounces last quarter, the highest level in more than five years.


#8 Gold Prices Almost Always Do An accounting of Central Bank Recklessness over the long run.  

* Since the 50s, gold was closely correlated to growth in the Fed’s balance sheet and the money supply of the U.S Dollar.  I believe as the central banks of the world continue to destroy the value of their currencies by endless QE and inflation, eventually the markets will come to realize the danger of paper fiat currencies and move back into Gold.

#9 Gold is Diverging Positively from the Broken Down Commodities
 
* Perhaps one of the strongest reasons why Gold looks attractive is that is starting to show strength despite the downtrend in commodities and a strong dollar.   The commodity collapse during the second-half of 2008  saw spot gold post a positive annual return of 5.78%

#10 Commercials are Positioning for for Gold Strength.  

* In gold markets, commercial participants (jewelry manufacturers and bullion banks) are traditionally net short
and speculators (hedge funds and money managers) are traditionally net long.  The fact that commercials are becoming net-long is extremely exciting and a very strong sign.   Commercial participants have reduced net short positions to the lowest levels in 14 years

16-01-30,43egkp,Using Brokerage Account as a Savings Account?,"My thought is that the bank pays next to nothing in terms of interest on a savings account so why not use my brokerage account instead and invest those funds in safe/stable growth stock? For example, 5K invested in MSFT at this time last year would be worth $6621 today, that's a lot better than the 0.05% the bank would pay me. Obviously there are always risks involved in investing but you could diversify into 5 stable stocks and mitigate the risk somewhat I think no? I just feel like it shouldn't be too tough to beat what the bank is going to pay me in interest. Thoughts?",3

I am relatively new to investing and have read up extensively on the subject and so far have had a little success. Although most of my investments have been through recommendations from family members who are very experienced in the matter. 

I was just wondering what you guys tend to look at in general when considering whether to invest your money in a particular company you find interesting? I've found that the books that I read go into great depth in explaining the technical terms and explanations of possible outcomes in stock fluctuations however they were not very clear on what fundamentals to look for when initially deciding whether or not to buy.

So I thought I'd get a second opinion on what sort of info do you guys like to look at before deciding whether a certain stock is the one for you?

Any help would be much appreciated :)",36

16-01-31,43jshv,[Serious] Need some good book recommendations on stock trading.,"Hello,

Last week, I bought $33,000 in Visa stock in an attempt to recover myself from a DWTI YOLO loss. I'm getting close to recovering my losses and then some.

I now have less of an interest in investing and more on trading to build up personal capital. Why sit on something when you can trade stuff instead? Buy stocks with good fundamentals, wait for a market downturn, and then sell high. And then snowball the earnings into another stock and ride it up, etc. 

I'm seeking good books to read about technical analysis and trading so that I can identify solid momentum stocks like Visa and ride them back from market downturns. 

That said, I'm looking into options too, as I can buy and sell options on Fidelity now, and eventually I want to combine options with buying huge amounts of stock for optimal gains. But that's for later. 

I know it's not going to be easy, but I want to learn. ",3

I know William O'Neil prefers price/volume movements (the famous cup with handle) and other technicians use something similar where base forms before it breaks out.  But would this matter as much in, say, a value stock?
