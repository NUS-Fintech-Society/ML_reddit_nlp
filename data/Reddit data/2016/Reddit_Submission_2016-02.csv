16-02-01,43lv59,"Derivatives trading platforms that allows two 'sell at profit' prices","I am trading derivatives using the platform Plus500.

All platforms I've found so far I' m looking at only allows you to set one sell at profit price, and a sell at loss price.

I want a platform which allows me to Set multiple (two) sell at profit prices. To place two limits in the same position.

Example:

* I **short** Oil at 33.60.

* Oil is **currently** 33.20

* Sell oil at profit automatically if price hits 33.40

* Sell oil at profit automatically if price hits 33.00.

Can anyone recommend a platform which can do this?",9

I am calling bottom again and think that the stock gets back up to around the $0.90 - $1 mark in the next 2-6 weeks.


**WARNING** – this stock is low volume and volatile


**Basics –**


* Currently at $0.55 - 0.60/share on Nasdaq
* Market Cap: $6.38M
* Average Volume: 144,977
* [Latest filings](http://investors.signalgenetics.com/)


Company
Signal Genetics is a commercial stage, molecular genetics diagnostic company focused on providing innovative diagnostic services that help physicians make better-informed decisions concerning the care of their patients suffering from cancer – They make tests to tell the doctor how to best treat a specific strain of cancer, right now they are focused on multiple myeloma.


Why make this bet?
Cash value of the company should be approximately $0.9 - $1 per share (calculated from latest financials and looking at the company burn rate) and SGNL has a cash runway until 2017.
[Consensus price target is $3.44 from 4 analysts covering ~520% upside](http://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/SGNL/)


SGNL is executing on its market plan.  The big reason this stock fell is that the MyPRS test took much longer to gain acceptance and generate revenue than expected.  Initial revenue came from a grant UAMS.  This funding has been dwindling the past few quarters.  However, the real money, hospital growth has seen steady adoption year over year (an increase of 82% growth).  [I expect there to be even larger growth in Q4 because of agreements with PPO networks that were initiated in Q2 and Q3 with 133 million patients covered.](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AMDA-2OH8PD/1372381313x0x867849/6854F209-EBA8-47F6-BAC3-BC80E25CBB53/SGNL_Fact_Sheet_-_December_2015.pdf)

What PRs will lead to a price increase over the next 2 months?

* Earnings will be out within 3 weeks.  Further establish cash value and adoption trend.
* They will be announcing a new product in Q1, I think this will be a big catalyst.
* There should be ongoing updates about the 200 person trial at the University of Texas.  This product is an assay not a drug, so results are much more fast-paced.
* SGNL may (this is just pure speculation) also divulge their major pharmaceutical partner as well.
* I expect signal to increase PR and promotion to ensure the stock hits $1 and stays there for 10 consecutive days for Nasdaq compliance. 

Risks

* This is a low volume, high volatility microcap stock.
* Some people think the Chairman of the Board is a scumbag…  Maybe, but he has a personal tie to this company because of his wife.
* The entire biotech sector is very down right now (this might be a positive if you expect a rebound soon)


TLDR;
$SGNL is a neat biotech company with a product that works.  Increasing hospital revenue streams.  Trading below cash value.  New product soon.  Short term increase of 70-100% (2-6 wks).  Long term increase of 200-500% with revenue from increased adoption.  High volatility, low volume.  YOLO

16-02-01,43lzez,"More updates on GRN, carbon credits, and where the data comes from.","I found the daily trading data for the two most widely traded carbon credit products. This should help those who want to know when to buy GRN, the average person's only way to speculate in this new and important market

Here are the links to the trading report of Certified Emissions Reductions (CER) and European Union Allowances (EUA) from the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) website:

https://www.theice.com/marketdata/reports/94
https://www.theice.com/marketdata/reports/82

To recap, GRN is a ETN run by iPath that tracks a Barclays index main composed of these two emissions products. I think it might also track the price of carbon in Kyoto. Anyway, ICE is the exchange where this stuff is traded, along with oil futures. ICE is a publicly traded company that has been buying up commodities exchanges over the last decade.

Anyway I am glad i did the research and found these daily reports of the trading of the actual carbon products. The reflect the recent drop in price of GRN, so at least it can be said there is no (or little) manipulation of the ETN. I think because of the drop in oil prices, and the stock market and worries about the economy, the people who actually buy carbon credits (power plants, etc) are not willing to hedge against projected future downturns. The peak in the price of GRN in November has to do with speculation before the recent UN climate conference. There will be another annual conference this November, but i think that the ""important"" conferences are only every five years. Still i am optimistic about the market as a whole, despite all the corruption in the markets, I don't think ""the big one"" is upon us, at least until May, then ask me again. I wish I had known about the source data for this ETN sooner, then I would have held off buying during this downturn. Now I am sharing this valuable data with y'all. The more people invest in this tiny ETN, the more liquid it will become and the easier to get a fair price. Happy hunting and break a leg!",0

16-02-01,43mfgo,Basis for Rebalancing vs. Static Allocation,"Hi everyone, I was thinking about portfolio rebalancing today and was hoping some people would chime in. It seems to me that rebalancing must be both beneficial enough to cover costs from any taxes/fees incurred in the rebalancing and produce equal or greater returns to a static allocation to be worthwhile. 

(This is, of course, assuming that you use the Warren Buffett/Charlie Munger definition of risk, rather than the traditional academic one. Personally, I do use this as I have a 40 year or so pre-retirement time frame). The relevant quote from Charlie Munger is: ""Using [a stock’s] volatility as a measure of risk is nuts. Risk to us is 1) the risk of permanent loss of capital, or 2) the risk of inadequate return.""

Given this, what do you think is the better path and can you link to any academic research to support this?",6

[Chapter 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/42pb73/translation_eli5_on_how_china_fucked_their_own/)

**Chapter 2: How the housing bubble is created**

Rapid development! Everyone working in the south east coast of China is now rich, export are up, economic success! We made money, we paid off our debts, time to urbanize! Everyone buy houses in the city because so much face! Not enough houses?

No matter, I will borrow money, and build an apartment over my house!  One for myself, one for sale! Note that from 1990s to the 2003, although housing prices have gone up by a lot, those are mainly inflation and our wages increase are catching up with housing price growth.  That is, until 2003.

So, Happy Home Construction Inc. lasted until 2003, and the govt finally caught on: ""how come we no make money from this?"" Nobody fucking build your own houses on your own land, everything belongs to the government!

From 2003 to 2013, if you look [these graphs](http://www.voxeu.org/sites/default/files/image/FromMay2014/fang%20fig1%2026%20may.png), you can totally see the explosive growth of housing prices. A house worth 100 in 2003 is now 600 due to a series of policies.
   
But wait! The government is not building houses, how are they responsible for the price inflation? Dumbshit, that's because they are in monopoly of the land supply. It's all fun and giggles when Wen Jiabao came, and then things got worse....

Seeing his people suffer from increasing housing price, Wen made the policies with the following reasoning:

1. Limit the supply of land, to bar land developers from entering the market

2. Increase law enforcement on unregulated land developing, to make it harder for land developers to [cut corners](http://shanghaiist.com/2015/12/11/villas_with_giant_cables.php)

3. Increase the tax rate for land developing, to increase the difficulty for land developers to profit

4. Limit lending to land developers, to make land developing more costly

5. Limit the property market, to make buying/selling property harder.

Yeah. That's what he did.  So did any of these policies help with making housing prices more affordable?

If your answer is yes, you are a retard.

Unfortunate for China, the MAJORITY of them are retards. Wen has done exactly the opposite of what's needed to lower the housing prices: open up the market, let supply-demand determine the prices.

All his policies leads to the decease of supply in the property market, which makes demand even higher in perspective, driving house prices even higher. The fun part? The citizens cheered for his stupid ass policies.

A housing bubble that is supposed to form slowly has now grown exponentially by 800% in 10 years. That's eight and two zeroes.  The govt just can't resist sticking their monopoly noses into everything. And has single handy caused the housing bubble, leading a bull into desert.",3

16-02-01,43mwhd,"Investment Idea: UWTI - currently $2.50, guaranteed to revert to 'geomean' ($9).","In all seriousness, I think UWTI is one of the safest bets available right now. Take a look at this chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/4WBMh8eI/

This is my analysis of a bunch of paired leveraged ETFs. The top part of the chart shows the divergence between the bull and bear ETFs (represents the opportunity potential). Crude oil (the thick dark line) is by far the most extreme divergence right now, which means it has the best opportunity.

The bottom of the chart shows the bullish ETF in blue, the bearish ETF in red, and the Geometric Mean (geomean) of the two in black. In the long run, the geomean always trends downwards (caused by daily-reset slippage), and both red and blue always intersect at the geomean. In the long run, both ETFs are *guaranteed* to revert back to the geomean.

The UWTI/DWTI geomean is currently around $19, while UWTI is at $2.5. Worst case scenario, if oil waited two whole years before rallying, the geomean could get as low as $9. Therefore, worst-case scenario returns are $9/2.5 = 260% ROI.

Note that the price will probably go lower before it goes higher. So, there could be significant (50%+) draw-down in the mid-term. But as long as you just hold the position, UWTI is guaranteed to eventually revert back to its geomean, currently around $19 and likely to stay above $9 for the next 2 years. As long as you can just hang on to the position, you'll be sure to profit. Just don't use any leverage (so you don't get kicked out) and you'll be fine.

So, to summarize, if you have money that you don't need to use for 2 years, put it into UWTI and just wait for it to hit the geomean ($9 or higher).

By the way, the formula for the geomean line is:  (UWTI * DWTI) ^ 0.5

Let me know what you think about this idea, or if you have any questions.

EDIT:  Please notice that I am not talking about ""reversion to a moving average"" or other such ideas. I am pointing out a mathematical property unique to paired leveraged ETFs.

FINAL EDIT:  Now I see the logical flaw in this investment idea:  If UWTI or DWTI have a stock split, it will affect the position of the geomean.  Therefore, today's geomean has no predictive value, even though historical charts seem to imply that it does (a type of survivorship bias).  Thanks for the discussion, guys!",0
16-02-01,43mpp4,"For the uninformed, I'm going to do a five minute session on the World and United States Ag Condition.....aka why ""recession"" is about to be an understatement.","The United States is in a deep agricultural recession, and without a major catastrophe in the next twelve months wll be in a depression. This will allow the informed and purposed investor to buy the dip on land values and prosper with time. It is NOT to say that those who are long land now should sell, because there are individual economies and factors that any reasonable person can ascertain to make their own decisions. So, here we go.   Also, I trade grain for a living, so my info comes from a mixture of opinions, generally accepted facts, and my perma bear mentality.

Land is overvalued. Its been climbing at an inorganic rate since the early 2000's. Some people blame it on ethanol, which raised the relative value of corn. Me personally, don't really care why, just care what is. It's a simple situation, we have a lot of land that has been purchased between 10 and 20k/acre since 2001. I'm specifically using Iowa and Illinois, but other states are as follows. KS, I think like 4-7k/acre east and up to 1500/acre west. the entire southeast, i've heard 5k and i've heard as high as 7. California,.....just fucking wow. A lot of tree quality land traded in the central valley last summer for 32 or 33k/acre. Dakota's, not sure, don't really care. Sorry. Anyway, this is reflective of a bullish commodity price and a bearish land availability concept. To say....people have the ""they aren't makng any more land"" mentality. As with all things folksy, that is bullshit. Just cause they aren't making anymore, doesn't mean you need to fucking buy it. Our commodity prices do not reflect the land at its values, and this makes me think we are in a land bubble that is about to burst.

Commodity prices. They suck. like, a lot. here in CA, we are trading nut byproducts for 50% what we were a year ago. Corn is trading for about 50% what it was trading for 18 months ago. Soy is trading for about 57% what it was 18 months ago. Wheat is like 65% or so of what it was 18 months ago.No clue on any of the human consumption products, i don't deal in those and don't monitor. Since this encompasses the most producing acres in our country, this is the focus of this discussion. This is indicative of the above stated oversupply, and should inform users that we are production heavy. Not a bad thing per se, just a thing that needs to be monitored and considered. This is part of what happened in the early 80's.

The US dollar. bitch has been screaming up. Thats a big yay for the world travellers and importers, not so great for the exporters. The US is a net exporter for ag, meaning we send more shit out than comes in. Strong dollar means we aren't competitive like we were two years ago. THis has been part of the downward pressure on our commodity prices.

This is the alpha, the omega, and where some people may villify me. Credit. Credit. Fucking credit. It's been too cheap, for too long. I want to do an empirical study into the correlation between cheap money and long term detriment of an economy. Cheap money has contributed to the explosion of the land prices, to the housing economy, to everything. We all can agree that 3% interest is fucking free money, so people get carried away and say ""well its free money, thanks bank"". I have a huge problem with it, I think it encourages abandonment of basic logic and financial prudence. It encourages artificial growth in market segments as it allows people to pay more for an asset because their net payment is the same. WHich leads to increased demand for a fixed good, more competition, and net net an overvaluation while starving supply. 

I could honestly go on forever, but I think i've said enough. Basically, i'm super bearish land and housing, if you are looking to buy land, i beg you to wait a couple three five years. DOn't be afraid of ""they are gonna raise the cost of credit"" Run the math, and see your payment on 100 acres at 3% and 12k/acre vs 100 acres at 7% and 7k/acre. It's just math, and you'll see long term you massively come out ahead, because not only are you getting a lower payment you also get to capture that appreciation. So I guess what i'm saying is, the ag world is three different flavors of fucked, it would behoove you to wait.

PS, if you're young and thinking of buying a home, look at the average sale price in 2009 and then look at 2015. Tell me if that level of appreciation is organic growth.

Nokia's shares fell 10 percent after the Finnish firm said the Samsung deal would lift patent unit Nokia Technologies' sales to around 1.02 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in 2015, including catch-up payments, from 578 million euros in 2014.

The patent business will become a smaller part of Nokia after its proposed 15.6 billion euro takeover of French network gear rival Alcatel-Lucent, whose shares also fell by 10 percent following news of the Samsung patent deal.

16-02-01,43orcy,Evaluate this quick price target method,"I'm trying to learn a bit more about stock valuation and I'm curious as how effective do you guys think this quick price target method would be:

1. Gather industry average P/E
2. Look for companies with a P/E under said average
3. Use the formula Price = P/E * EPS to find a prospected price target for said company

Example: I know airlines are not recommended here, but for testing purposes we'll use airlines.

1. Airlines industry averages: P/E = 10 ([source](https://biz.yahoo.com/p/770conameu.html))
2. Delta airlines ($DAL). EPS = 5.64
3. 10 * 5.64 = Price target **$56.40**

Of course, I will not base my investment decision based on this calculation but my question is: would this be a reasonable way to determine if this stock is undervalued and should have a price target of $56.40?",3

The first few days were the worst start to a year ever for stocks, and January was the weakest month for the Dow and S&amp;P 500 since 2009.

Chinese stocks continued to free fall, and crude oil fell to the lowest levels in 12 years. And so on.

The only things that actually didn't fall in January was the price of gold, silver, and US Treasury bonds.

16-02-01,43qfad,What are your favorite 2016 value picks and why? My current holdings included.,"I wanted to get /r/investing's thoughts on what your favorite value picks / holdings are and why? 

Mine are below, and would love to hear feedback, advice or suggestions.

**$SWHC** - Sin stock / controversial discount, I got in at the $15 range, its election year, ISIS terrorism threats are high, NCIs checks at record levels, quarterly projections up 20%, cash generating machine trading at industrial multiples, should trade closer to consumers, currently in XM17 contract worth potentially $250mm, likely driving $50+ mm more sales per year from contract and consumer buys. M&amp;P Product Line has had excellent growth and is leader in CCW market, the most profitable segment due to low polymer costs. Excellent track record of innovative products and bringing to market, with very low R&amp;D costs. M&amp;A has been in accessories market, which the average consumer spends the same amount as the original gun itself, and higher margin. Lots of roll-up in the industry. Risks: NWC and channel build up after sales settle like previous cycle.

**$RDS.A** - Trading near all time historical lows due to low oil and short-term bears on expensive BG group acquisition, bought at $26 dividend yield over 9.5% management expected to keep as well as cut operating costs by $3/4Bn and turn around profitability, lowest P/B in sector @ .6, BG Group adds LNG (byproduct of E&amp;P activities and more profitable), 20% more reserves, 30% more production and making it the 2nd largest oil conglomerate, albeit expensive @ current Oil and LNG prices. No risk of bankruptcy due to massive scale and assets, as well as $30 BN of cash. Risks: Oil staying in the low's short term.

**$PRAA** - Debt collection business has taken a hit due to low amounts of charge-offs driven by cheap credit and strong economy, cash generating machine with stellar growth and profitability. Suffering due to one time impairments @ very attractive multiples, especially as company benefits from recession, strong performance during the last cycle. Recent high leverage from international M&amp;A growing top line, profitability and the 40% market leader in an industry with high entries to barrier dominated by two companies. Auto / Home sales at record or strong levels means more potential charge-offs. Risks: Regulations, tax liabilities and low charge-off rates from strong economy despite current sell-off.

**$OLN** - Trading low recently also at 09 trough levels and decline in profitability from commodity pricing pressure, consistent 5% dividend yield, business merging with DOW making it the largest Chlor-Alkalai manufacturing. Kicker for half the business being Winchester, a profitable and growing ammunition manufacturer, which ammunition should see the firearms sales spike growth delayed in a few months. Risks: Commodity pricing exposure

**$WMT** - Horrible 2015 trading near 09 trough levels, big turnaround planned for 2016, healthy 3% dividend yield and focus on profitability and e-commerce. Very defensive and one of the few strong performers so far in 2016. A downturn would unlikely affect WMT with a beta of .2. Risks: AMZN, increasing wages, low / long e-commerce growth / success, poor execution and profitability near term. 

**Currently up ~20% driven by SWHC, RDS.A, OLN and WMT**

**Others I Like:** 

**GILD, LCI, ARLP/AHGP, AAPL, MDLZ, AFSI, RICK, SAVE, FCX** ",23

16-02-01,43q6g0,Stock and Bonds Down Together Today,"**Equities:** The MAR16 SP500 is down .3% this morning to 1923.50, after a sub-50 ISM manufacturing report was released at 10am EST. We still believe the market may try to test the key 1955 level. This is a busy week for earnings and economic data, with Alphabet earnings out after the bell today plus non-farm payrolls gets released this Friday. Overall, it seems like earning have been respectable, with some technology companies having hugely positive reports, such as Facebook. We believe there is spillover buying today from last week's surprise BOJ announcement of negative interest rates.

**Bonds:** The MAR16 US bonds are down 10 ticks to 160'23. It is very interesting to see both stocks and bonds move lower in concert this morning. We notice that on Friday's committment of traders weekly report, the commercial traders (sometimes called the smart money) got very short bonds last week as prices rallied. Perhaps the bonds will balance lower this month. Friday's jobs report should provide a strong impetus either way.

**FX:** The MAR16 USD is down .5% to 99.14. The trend is technically still higher, so we believe this could be a pullback in an eventual move higher. There is massive uncertainty as to how the Fed will act (or not act) throughout the rest of 2016; this uncertainty could mean more volatility for the USD as well as bonds. The MAR16 Euro is up 61 ticks to 109.00. It looks to be in a consilidation period on the daily chart.

**Commodities:** MAR16 WTI crude oil is down 5% today to $31.92. We believe the next minor technical support region is near $31.30. This Wednesdays inventory report could be the next major market moving event. FEB16 gold continues its recent strength, up 1% today to $1127. Our next technical target is $1141.

16-02-02,43sdvf,"New to stocks, (Canadian) I am wondering what my best options are during a takeover/merger","Hi all,
I'm sure many of you are aware of the dip in oil prices happening around the world. Back in Dec 2014 I noticed the trend that oil prices were plummeting and decided to invest in this sector for the long haul in anticipation of a rebound. I bought COS.TO (Canadian Oil Sands) shares at $11.33/ share. Now that oil prices haven't rebounded and the forecast looking gloomier day by day, I am wondering if I should take a loss and tender my shares to Suncor's offer of 1 COS share for 0.28 SU share.

I've done some quick math, and because of the higher price I bought approximately $5000 worth of COS shares at $11.33/share (I jumped the gun a bit and I guess hind-sight is 20/20), it would be (in all tense and purposes) the equivalent of me buying SU shares at around $40.46 / share. As of right now (Feb 1 2016), SU is trading at $31.83 / share if I was to tender to Suncor’s offer.
Now, my dilemma is should I tender my share and take the loss and purchase more SU shares after to even out my $/share or should I wait and see what would happen after the tender offer expires? My main concern is that I don’t want to be in a situation where COS goes bankrupt when I could have had the opportunity to “jump ship” so to speak.

Do you see a situation where COS would be able to sustain its operations or is bankrupt inevitable in the future and take the loss and tender?
Curious to hear your thoughts on anyone that have been through a similar situation and thank you for taking the time to read this!

Before I get berated with comments on my level of competency / foolishness, please understand that I've moved passed this and am wanting to hear some advice from knowledgeable users in this community.

Thanks guys.",2

16-02-01,43r404,Fundamental Analysis of HAS and MAT,"I am new to investing and I am hoping to get into value investing and want to learn to analyze a company’s 10q/10k and other financials to determine potentially undervalued/overvalued companies.  
 
Here is a case study for Hasbro, Inc ($HAS) and Mattel, Inc ($MAT) but I am not really sure how to interpret the information that I am finding. Some guidance would be appreciated.  

From each 2015 Q3 Financial Report:  
Hasbro, Inc.  


- Notable Brands: Star Wars: TFA + Jurassic World + NERF  
- Revenue: 1.4B +9% YOY (US&amp;CAN +5% YOY, International -6%)  
- EPS Q3: 1.64, TTM: 3.50  
- Cash at quarter end: $551.3M (“substantially all of which is held outside of the United States”)  
- Share repurchase: 338k shares in Q3, totaling $26M. $491.3M available in repurchase program.  
- Dividend: $0.46 (increased by $0.03 every calendar year for last several years)  
- Income before taxes: $284M (+16% YOY)  
- P/E 20.91  
- Market Cap 9.1B   

Mattel, Inc:


- Notable Brands: Barbie, Fisher-Price, Hot Wheels, Dora the Explorer, MEGA Blocks (acquisition finalized in Q1 2015)  
- Revenue: 1.1B -11% YOY (North Am. -5% YOY, International -20% YOY)  
- EPS Q3: 0.66, TTM: 0.88 (negative in 15Q1 and 15Q2)  
- Cash at quarter end: 289M ($210M overseas)  
- No share repurchase in Q3, but in 2013 the board authorized $500M, of which $200M remains  
- Dividend: $0.38 (unchanged since increase in 2013 Q4)  
- Income before taxes: $286M (-28% YOY)  
- P/E 29.83  
- Market Cap 9.1B  


Industry Average/Totals:


- Market Cap: $18B  
- P/E: 21.9  
- Price to Book: 17.86 (MAT = 3.779, HAS = 5.959)  

**HAS Analysis**: Due to further decreases in currency exchanges, I would anticipate further small YOY decreases in Europe and LA due to increasing strength of dollar (which saw -4% YOY in Europe and -13% in Latin America and -1% in Asia). I would also anticipate the Star Wars: TFA merchandise will bring sales for Q4 above estimates. The share repurchase commitment/execution is a plus and promising for long term investment. The P/E is below the industry average.  

**MAT Analysis**: Due to further decreases in currency exchanges, I anticipate further small YOY decreases in Europe and LA due to increasing strength of dollar (which saw -18% YOY in Europe and -29% in Latin America and +1% in Asia). The P/E is above industry average.  
  
**Conclusions**: HAS and MAT are clearly seasonal stocks which perform best during the holiday season (as evidenced by quarterly EPS). Since overall consumer spending was down in Q4, I estimate that we would see this effect carry out into HAS and MAT. HAS has been on a steady incline for Jan., where MAT has been decreasing. I would rate HAS as appropriately valued, and MAT overvalued. What are your thoughts? Do you agree or disagree?  

**Note: I wrote this as a practice and did not realize MAT released their Q4 earnings today so I did not include that in my analysis. But considering MAT bumped up by 6.5%, where did I go wrong?**

BP said it would cut 3,000 jobs in its downstream unit by the end of 2017 on top of 4,000 cuts already announced in oil and gas production as part of a $2.5 billion restructuring program announced last year.

""We are continuing to move rapidly to adapt and rebalance BP for the changing environment,"" Chief Executive Bob Dudley said in a statement.

Fourth-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, BP's definition of net income, came in at $196 million, significantly lower than analysts' expectations of $730 million.

Fourth-quarter impairments reached $2.6 billion as its oil and gas production division was hit by weak energy prices, including fields in the Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. Utica shale acreage in Ohio and Libya.

In its bid to enter Michigan, the company could try to fly around state law by establishing a relationship with a licensed repair facility or resort to legal action if Michigan snubs the request.

There's also a grass roots movement to put the Tesla question to voters in the state on the ballot in November.

16-02-02,43s44g,"Thanks, Gold and Silver Miners","I've never put myself into another tax bracket during the first month of the year before, to be honest. Thanks to ABX and HL, though, there is a first time for everything. 35% or so return on the first and 32% on the second. Well, from the portions of my positions I sold off (GG, as well) - based off the performance of the Asian/European economies, the junk bond market, and the dovish behavior of the Fed, I suspect there is more to be made here yet.

I thought I saw an opportunity around the 15th, with the whole gold mining sector at the tail-end of a bad sell-down and macroeconomic conditions seeming ideal that I decided to YOLO it as large as I could; I'm glad it worked out, because honestly I know almost nothing about the precious metals markets and the research I did into it consisted of nothing useful (simply zerohedge and their polar opposites).

Anyhow, I've decided to leave the remainder of my positions open - the basic fact that nearly this whole sector had just hit a hard bottom, right when their linked commodities took off in the face off public fear of a recession, suggests to me that there is significant room for growth over the next 1-2 months. 
It is somewhat ironic - the first time I get bumped up a tax bracket during the first month of the year, is also the first time I catch myself hoping for a global economic downturn.",10

The bears recognize that while the stock market always goes higher over the long haul, it can take decades for it to reach new highs, all the while sinking to unexpected lows in a deflationary environment. They realize that an economy based on prolonged record low interest rates leads to excessive debts and is not sustainable, especially in a world where the largest economies are all suffering from aging populations, which slows consumer spending.

**Chapter 3: Credit crisis, how did it happen**

Oh man! Where were we up to? Ah yeah...selling land plots! Fucking genius man! Whoever came up with the idea to privatize lands, and then confiscate it later for a monopoly market can have all my Mao.  But hey, can we make things *even more fucked up*?

Let's try this, we buy (read: confiscate) a plot of land just outside downtown and leave the farmer with 500.000, then we spend 1.500.000 on developing it, then we sell it for 10,000,000! Profit!

Here's the challenge.  Try fuck up this business model. Seriously.  Just find a way to fuck this up.  What? Impossible? You are fired! *BANG

Yeah, the officials managed to do that. Imagine that. Here's how:

1. Initiate Economic reform. Hand over the job to **S**tate **o**wned **E**nterprises.

2. Make up a law to prohibits all SoE from involving themselves in land development.

3. Open a private business and install yourself as boss.

4. Have the State owned Enterprises hand over all their land development projects to your private business

But wait, this is fucked up! There is no way this is going to end well! The private companies are taking public money into their own pockets, not to mention its source of funds are ambiguous as hell! The private companies are just going to borrow a shit load of money, take on a shit load of land developing projects at once, and push out a supply so hard it fuck demands into the negative!

And that baby girl, is exactly what happened. Milton Friedman once said: ""Nobody spends somebody else’s money as carefully as he spends his own. Nobody uses somebody else’s resources as carefully as he uses his own."" These SoE and private companies are the most careless, most irresponsible companies of all.

But wait! Can it get even worse? *Yes.* You know about the face culture of China right? Yeah, it played a huge part in this massive fuck up.  Developing 10 plots of land has brought political achievements to the local official, so the town next doors thought he must top that, and they did the unimaginable: financing. 

Richzhou saw Nongville develop 10 plots of land to develop, the town mayor thought he has to top that so he confiscated 20 plots of land to do the same.  Then Zhuville saw that and did 40, Tsuville saw that and did 80, Bunville saw that and kick reason to the curb and do the impossible...he did 200.  Officials are no longer are trying to develop lands for sale, but instead are borrowing money and spending on pointless infrastructures to add on to their political achievements. 

Ten years.  This bullshit continued for 10 whole fucking years and the loans are due. Fuck! How can we raise money? Sell all the fucking lands! But there are only 10 families wanting land out there and we have 200,000 plots of land to sell!  I don't think I need to go over the law of supply and demand to tell you what's gonna happen next.

The question is: ~~How are they going to repay their debts?~~ How are we going to make them pay their debts? It's the government's who's borrowing money man, they have da gunz.

For now we are refinancing them (let them borrow even more money to pay back their loans) to keep things afloat for a while, but eventually we will have to come to a conclusion.  Either we print more money and devalue the currency to shit to come up with the cash to repay, or we...just let our entire credit system go to shit?

Or, is there a third option for us?",5

Its sealants and adhesives consist of Green Polyurethane and referred to as sealant products.
&gt; The Company competes with BASF, Sherwin Williams, PPG, Benjamin Moore, AKZO Nobel, Rust-Oleum and Sika AG.""
&gt; 

HCTI has been beat the fuck down over the past 3 years. They've never had a product on the shelf and have had piss for revenue. In January, HCTI signed a 3 year $4 million dollar distribution deal with industrial finishes, giving them their first chance at viable income since the company's inception. This alone should give the company more value than a quarter of a penny, but they are also ""in the works"" of several fortune 500 deals, or at least, that's what the PR releases have stated. 

What it sounds like is they are doing is licensing their patents to fortune 500 companies and then collecting royalties on the revenue generated from the company's products, limiting their manufacturing costs. The said deal is speculated to be worth up to 20 million annually. They are operating under a NDA right now, so this could be why they haven't updated investors on their december pr of, ""we are about to finalize this deal, bitches"". 

Right now, there is a nice pennant forming. With positive news this could explode upwards. 

I'm not telling you fucks to invest, you probably wouldn't anyways because you can't play the fuccboi WSB option circle jerk on this one.

I'm starting a small $6k and treating it as if it were 20 times larger - $10 loss is a $200 loss. 

Anyways, basically I am buying stock in companies that seem to have been performing well over the last 5,10,15,20 years. I buy them when they're at a low. For that, I check out the day, week, month, year fluctuations. 

Here's some things. Can you guys give me some critique on these?

1. If I'm holding long term, I just buy it when it's at a 2 day low. It's better to start now then never for funds like Vanguard (in my opinion) so I'll just put stuff in there now. 

2. If I'm holding short term &lt;1 year, I buy it when it's at a 3 month low. I also check up on the general thoughts and views on the company as a brand -- what people think of them and how they're perceived. Like Apple, they're not doing hot, but I have faith that they'll put that huge asset pool to use. Same with Boeing, they're doing pretty bad but they've got quite a few planes out there and they're the only aircraft company that I ever hear about. Their price dropped so it seems like a time to jump in even if I lose a bit at first.

3. Disney - they're at a low for the year, but they have an overall large growth, so I'm hoping it will go back up since the dip only occurred recently and they seem to be pretty highly regarded in just about everything.

4. QQQ - they do well over a long period but not so great recently. Which is why I'm buying. 

5. BAC - this is one where I'm taking a risk. They did pretty badly in a 20 year outlook but over the last 3 years they've been performing decently. They're at a all year low right now which is why I'm buying. I don't hear much good opinions on BAC but people still use them no matter what and I'm sure they'll go back up again. 

6. AMZN, GOOGL, NFLX - I bought these as long term stocks. They're pretty volatile and I bought them at high points. But I think they'll do well in the long run. 

7. WMT - I bought this for the dividend payout and plus it seems to be doing decently.

8. FB - I'm planning on selling once it gets to 120 or so. I'm pretty risk adverse so I don't want to take the chance of it going higher. Even if it does go higher, I will learn to place a little more trust in these companies. But I really do think that FB is a bubble right now.

I've been searching for a daily stock market podcast I can listen to on my commute however I have not found anything I really enjoyed yet.  I decided to work on a podcast idea that would be a daily AM podcast to talk about the market with a specific individual. If you listen to podcasts like entrepreneur on fire, they have a single founder on each episode and ask the same set of questions to get an idea of how they got started and so on. I want to do the same thing with stocks, the episode would start off with current market news, then talk about the investor, how they got started, what they studied, what they look for in stocks, etc. I want to create something that beginners and experts can both listen to and get a few bits of information.

Is this a concept that would you be interested in? I'm thinking the podcast itself would be around 6 or 7AM each morning and release around 8 prior to the market opening. They would be around 30 min each.

If you would be interested in this, are their specific questions you would want asked. Finally, is this a type of podcast you would be interested in being on, i think hearing from experts and non-experts is important so people can see the market from different sides.",3

&gt; **Abstract:** “Stocks with ""patriotic"" names *earn positive abnormal returns of about 6% per annum* during the Second World War, the War in Korea and the War on Terror. These abnormal returns are not realized immediately upon the outbreak of each of the wars but are accumulated gradually during wartime. We hypothesize that victorious wars arouse investors' patriotic feelings and cause them to gradually and perhaps subconsciously gravitate toward stocks whose name has a patriotic flavor.”

&gt; **In addition, on p. 5:** “In other words, our results suggest that investors do not actively seek to invest in companies with patriotic sounding names upon the outbreak of a war; instead, they tend to invest more heavily than otherwise in such stocks, during wartime, whenever they come across them.”

Robustness checks performed for: industry effects (i.e. selection bias), by product market exuberance, by a few large stocks or IPOs. 

“The market” apparently fails to correct these mispricings, which persist over multiple years. ",17

16-02-02,43vrsa,Company Analysis - Atlassian,"**Symbol**: TEAM

**Earnings announcement date**: N/A

**Current Price Per Share**: $21.17

Atlassian went public in early December and the stock is down since the IPO.  Atlassian is best known for their enterprise software suite which is designed for software developers and project managers.  Their best known products are JIRA and Confluence which help communication of both progress and projects between different departments in many organizations.  Their other products are HipChat which has made a name for itself, however my judgement is that it has not truly taken off yet and Bitbucket which allows for the sharing of code.  They promote teamwork which is why TEAM is a perfect symbol. After about two months of being live, how does the company look and should you be looking to invest?

**The Facts**

* **P/E**: 441.04

* **EPS**: 0.05

* **Beta**: N/A

* **Market Cap**: 4.40B

* **52w High/Low**: 20.07 – 31.46

Lets take most of the numbers with a grain of salt, just for the fact being that stock is still new and still settling in.  That is the beauty of a new IPO in technology anything can happen, no beta to indicate risk, high P/E.  The one number here that is important to me is the market cap, do we really think that Atlassian is worth $4.4B dollars.

Their 3 month price chart while has a downward slope, you can see our EMA and SMA have not really moved too much.

For a start their profit margin is a mere 2.34% and their net income in 2015 was $6.8M.  Their F1 indicates heavy R&amp;D during the past 3 years, but we are still looking at around $10M for R&amp;D and shouldn’t have impacted the net income too much.

**Atlassian**

Lets focus on the company since I think the market still needs to accept what they do.  They are creating a team work space and building up an impressive list of clients ranging from FitBit to Paypal to NASA.  They are encroaching on SharePoint grounds to be that one stop shop for the company to share and collaborate.

What I ask myself is with such an impressive client list, why is the net income so low?  My guess is that they are basically giving away the product for now, let the clients buy in, then when it comes time to renew, the price goes up and the client is already fully vested in the brand / product.  If that is their plan, I do think it will work.  Seeing how well people are adopting these products and how the competition of freeware products are not living up to the hype, I believe companies are buying in low and will be renewing at a higher price to increase net income.

I personally see Atlasian worth buying for the long run, the questions that would remain are, when do clients contracts renew?  I do see the stock dropping for a bit until that time comes.  Maybe a late Q1 or early Q2 purchase?

16-02-02,43vsij,ELI5: What is happening to the stock market?,"I try to stay on top of this, but I've lost track. Is there something other than the low oil price that is causing the recent drops? The Fed raised rates based in large part on the position that the economy is good and improving.

Is this just a typical, but larger, correction?

If this is just the oil issue, why is this causing such an uproar when it hasn't in the past? I know that many companies' financials rely on a high oil price, but many dont (or are the opposite). If this is a consumer price scare (because of the drop in oil), I thought that was usually priced in to the fear around dropping consumer prices?

If you have been paying attention to biotech news you are probably aware of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology that has been making headlines recently. For those that aren't the quick explanation is that there is a protein in bacteria called Cas9, this protein uses an RNA strand as a guide to cut DNA. Why this is useful for researchers is that it allows genes to be quickly knocked out of cells as the repair of the DNA cuts in the cells aren't always perfect leading to a loss of the gene (commonly this happens around 30% of the time). 
CRISPR-Cas9 has useful applications in medicine as you can knock out genes that code for proteins that are the cause of disease, rather than modifying the protein through the application of a small molecule drug. The knockout of the protein is also permanent so you will only need the treatment once.  As such there is **a lot** of hype around rushing this technique to the clinic. 

So, why isn’t Editas the best buy you could ever make? The major elephant in the room is that they may not have the IP cover for the research they are doing (see the link in the article). This puts any investment into this company in the “maybe worthless” category until they win the IP battle.  It should also be noted that the original lab that generated the patent they are working from is not licensing more recent patents to Editas.

The next issue they face is that they are heading down a path that had been followed by two other technologies, monoclonal antibodies and RNAi therapeutics. While monoclonal antibodies have begun to make it to the clinic (The main drug of KBio was a monoclonal antibody, MedImmune also makes them) the RNAi therapeutics that had a slightly later start are yet to enter the clinic. The main issue faced by anything that uses RNA is that it has to be inside the cell to function, while small molecules can move across cell membranes RNA cannot as it is larger and carries a charge.  These technologies have taken decades to come to the clinic, and billions of dollars. 

Editas is a company made of hype that will take decades to turn any sort of profit if it wins the patent battle. My opinion is that at the current time this company is worthless as soon as I think it has reached an IPO peak I will be buying puts.

16-02-03,43z71o,The Fed Wants to Test How Banks Would Handle Negative Rates,"As interest rates turn negative around the world, the Federal Reserve is asking banks to consider the possibility of the same happening in the U.S.

In its annual stress test for 2016, the Fed said it will assess the resilience of big banks to a number of possible situations, including one where the rate on the three-month U.S. Treasury bill stays below zero for a prolonged period.

""The severely adverse scenario is characterized by a severe global recession, accompanied by a period of heightened corporate financial stress and negative yields for short-term U.S. Treasury securities,"" the central bank said in announcing the stress tests last week.

In that particular simulation, the unemployment rate doubles to 10 percent, the same level it reached in the aftermath of the last financial crisis.

Three-month bill rates have slipped slightly below zero several times in recent years, including in September after the Fed delayed rate liftoff amid global financial market turmoil, touching a low of minus 0.05 percent on Oct. 2.

But in the [stress test](http://www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/ccar.htm), banks would have to handle three-month bill rates entering negative territory in the second quarter of 2016, and then falling to negative 0.5 percent and holding there through the first quarter of 2019.

So lets take for example, it means it is economical to pump the oil for 40 years. Wouldn't they be better off selling it at a small profit (say 10$ a barrel over production costs) and make the money NOW, because in 10-20 years, there is the possibility that alternative energy, self driving cars, public transportation, robot servants, WHATEVER, reduces the demand tremendously in the future? 

I honestly find it hard to fathom that we would still be driving gasoline cars in 20 years, and find it impossible to believe we will still be mostly driving gasoline cars in 2050.

- a major redesign of iPhones always makes for a more attractive buy for the general public, much more sales than 6s (?)
- watch has huge potential imo 
- Apple Music performing better than predicted 

Also Apple is said to have a lot of ""war money"" to buy up another company.

I'm currently in the process of learning about investing, and am about to dig into asset allocation(!). I never thought those words would come out of my mouth :P

Everything I read for first time investors basically says to to look up portfolio examples and simulate your own. Does anyone have links to good portfolios that I could browse? I’m not really sure where to start or what to aim for. I think I’d like high dividend stocks, but a balanced portfolio overall. Who’s got experience and patience to help?

I would like to know, how many people with HCV that needs to be threated are there in the US, how many people will be in the future, how many patients have been already treated, and when HCV will shrink to a really small disease in the US.

then we need to understand what will it be for the other countries, and multiply for the expected cost of the cure there, maybe implying some discount to the prices.

As of today, the 6.5 forward P/E indicates that this HCV thing will be over in 4-5 years, Gilead will save the US from this threat, is it reasonable to think so, or HCV market will be big for more years, thus giving GILD the possibility to make more money and have a sustinable and precitable business in this industry for many more years? i.e. should gild be trading at higher multiplies or the 6.5 p/e in 5 years will go to 20, i.e. price stays even, but earnings fall 60%?",3

16-02-03,43yn6x,Is $CCOI massively overvalued?,"I was using a stock screeners to screen stocks with high p/e ratios and happened to come across CCOI.

How can this stock justify having a ridiculously high p/e ratio of 728.7 and a p/b ratio of 1,351? Even AMZN has a lower p/e ratio at 441.65, and AMZN has much greater quarterly revenue growth. There's absolutely no reason to suggest that CCOI would massive increase earnings, considering that it has a quarterly revenue growth of 7.70%

Furthermore, CCOI has a debt/equity ratio of 52,711.16.
So... What the hell? Is there something I'm not seeing here, or is this stock incredibly overvalued?

This is a list of all possible investment options and I would greatly appreciate if you all could help expand it.  The reason for this is that I have been searching for ways of investing and it seems like there are a bunch of things out there but no real collection of all (as much as possible) ways of investing.  This is mainly to let people know what exists out there and to allow them to research more on the topic on there own time.  Please feel free to comment with corrections and expansions to any category.  I will do my best to ensure the main topic is updated

And just so we are on the same page, the definition of investment is: ""*expend money with the expectation of achieving a profit or material result by putting it into financial schemes, shares, or property, or by using it to develop a commercial venture.*""

Thus all of these technically will increase money

Categorization Scale 1=safe investment 10=very high risk investment.  Also this is a linear scale for now.  Can change to a exponential scale if need be.

* The August bullshit reached its first local minimum on 8/24. It bounced and wiggled around until it reached the final local minimum on 9/29. This is 36 days, or 25 trading days. This marked the beginning of the recovery.

* We are in a slight net downward trend from August until now. This slopes the perceived support slightly down (bottom two red lines).

* On the upper panel, this all points toward a final local minimum on Feb. 16 (36 days) or Feb. 17 (25 trading days), at a price somewhere around 180 for the SPY.

* History doesn't always repeat itself, so the final kicker is that I'm going to be looking for a divergence in the MFI vs. Universal Oscillator (OR RSI vs. [insert your favorite oscillator here]) around February 16th. That is, I notice the oscillator diving down past 0 while the MFI is flat or rising. This will provide a little more support for my prediction.

At some point, either the market is going to trend so much lower, or macro fundamentals will deteriorate so much, or a singular shock to the system will force the Fed's hand. They will have to do QE4, ZIRP, or even NIRP.

Im trying to figure out why BAC has been dropping so consistently the past few days. I found an article by the WSJ but paywall keeps me from reading it. 

Anybody have some insight on whats going on here?

Thanks for reading!

Edit: I forgot to ask in the original post why BAC is performing worse than other big banks. BAC is down 24% in the past 3 months vs 13.1 for WFC and 12.3 for JPM.

16-02-03,442ijz,Fundamental Analysis: T-Mobile ($TMUS),"Disclaimer: I do not currently hold any TMUS positions, although depending on feedback to my analysis, I may start a short term hold until after earnings.  

Earnings date - Feb 17, 2016  

3Q-10Q  


* Total Debt 33B  
* Revenue: 7.8B up 7% YOY, up 11% in FY15 over FY14  
* EPS: 0.15, up from -0.12 in Q3 FY14 and 2.6x YTD in FY15 over FY14  
* P/E 63.9 (wireless communications industry average of 5.10)  

[Preliminary Q4 Earnings info](https://newsroom.t-mobile.com/news/t-mobile-adds-over-8-million-customers-for-second-consecutive-year.htm): 
 

* 2.1M new customers added in Q4 (-0.8% YOY but 3rd consecutive Q over 2M)  
* Total Customers: +15% YOY  
* Churn rate: -1.19% YOY  

Management: They seem to be trying to target a younger audience through intense marketing and social media presence. They even created a [AT&amp;T Earnings Report Drinking Game](https://newsroom.t-mobile.com/news/att-earnings-call-the-drinking-game.htm). They are attempting to label themselves as a disruptive company to a stagnant industry and seem to be willing to try anything.  

**Analysis**: I anticipate a jump after earnings due to the YOY customer growth and retention. They seem to be poised for growth and will be on my long-term watch list, but their comparatively high P/E has me concerned for the long-term considering present macroeconomic conditions.  

Please share your feedback/critiques. I am hoping to improve my fundamental analysis techniques, and my (first attempted exercise on [Hasbro and Mattel](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/43r404/fundamental_analysis_of_has_and_mat/) received no constructive feedback.

**Symbol**: MIME

**Earnings announcement date**: Feb-8

**Current Price Per Share**: $8.77

Mimecast offers email security tools to enterprise companies focused around security.  They offer security, archiving tools, and email continuity to help ensure compliance, up time, and safety.  These tools were created to integrate directly into your current email system including, Exchange, Office 365, and Google Apps.

With security being all the rage these days, and the ability to connect directly into the worlds largest email providers, Mimecast sure be a sure bet, right?

**The Facts**

* **P/E**: 45.15
* **EPS**: 0.20
* **Beta**: N/A
* **Market Cap**: 497.39M
* **52w High/Low**: 6.01 – 11.99

Much lower P/E here then we had with Atlassian yesterday and I also believe the market cap is more realistic here.  We are midway between the 52w high and low however the stock has been surging this week and expectations are high on the days leading up to the earnings report.

Net income is $7.56M dollars and the profit margin is 5.95%.  While that is still pretty low, we do see a quarterly revenue growth of 20% which means that the companies making more money.

One of the things to note here is that price of MIME just eclipsed the SMA and EMA lines.  While this is debated between traders, this could be a sign to buy as it indicates a bullish stock.

**Mimecast**

Mimecast is in a position where it will grow very quickly, but the question is, how long can it sustain its growth.  The tricky part about some of these SaaS services is that certain aspects of it are stick while others are not.  Compliance and archiving for example are very sticky, as it is time consuming and expensive to export and move your data.  Spam and virus filtering on the other hand are not that sticky.  My guess is that the average client signs up for the suite which is getting them all of the services.  These spaces also tend to become crowded and gain some stronger competition as time goes on.

I like that the product integrates directly with O365 and Google Apps, which I believe are going to be the major email platforms of the future.

I think Mimecast is a great stock to hold for the short term future.  I don’t know how much growth it can potentially sustain in this market, however with what should be a solid earnings report coming up, I can see it climbing in price.  I will continue to watch the stock to see what happens in the coming weeks.

Phone wait times were 90+ minutes and text chat reps were unresponsive.  I lost out on about $2k in options trading opportunity, which I know I can't hold them accountable for.  Luckily, the market tanked again after their servers went back up and I was able to sell for profit.  So I didn't loose and real money.  Not the point though.

I just got off the phone with a ""supervisor"" from tradeking who was talking about how they have to file my grievance of a loss with some regulatory body.  I complained up and down their social media site on Monday after I couldnt sell my puts and I actually was out about $2k in real money.  The supervisor gave me the usual customer service bullshit boiler plate and offered me $50 in trade credit, which I accepted even though its a pathetic offering considering the amount of financial exposure I had during the outage.

My questions are: What type of regulatory body are they filing with?  What will the repercussions from that regulatory body be? And would Tradeking be liable for at least the purchase price of my options had their downtime prevented me from selling and caused the loss of real money?  Finally, have I forfeited a right to be included in a class action lawsuit, should one be put together, by accepting the meager $50 trade credit. (Nothing about this was discussed on the phone.)

I should mention that I dont have any intention to try and hold them financially accountable for any perceived losses. Im just curious since I intend to be throwing a lot more $$$ into time sensitive options in the future.",1

16-02-03,4426hm,Basic investing principle: Think about the stock market as you would a bond.,"Reading the posts here in the past few weeks, I think a quick comment might be appropriate for how expected stock returns vary as prices change. My sense is that too many people here are focusing on the wrong thing hence my suggestion to think of the aggregate stock market as you would a bond.

What is the value of a bond? We know what the cash flows will be (the promised coupons + principal assuming no default). So given interest rates, it's simple to calculate the bond value as the present value of the cash flows.

Now what happens when the price of a bond goes down? The cash flows haven't changed so the expected returns from holding the bond to maturity must have gone up. So **Price Down =&gt; Returns Up.** The opposite (returns down) is true if the price of the bond goes up.

The very same concept applies to stocks. The value of a stock is the present value of cash flows (in this case, dividends and other distributions instead of interest payments). Suppose for a moment that the dividends are more or less fixed, but that the price moves around. If the price of stocks fall, then the expected return for stocks goes up (just as in the bond example).

*But hold you on, I hear you say.* If stock prices are going down, doesn't that mean that expected earnings (and hence dividends) are also going down. Yes, that's likely true as well. However, the key insight (which earned Robert Shiller his NP) is that **stock prices are too volatile compared to changes in fundamentals like dividends**. So when stock prices go way down, it's signaling that future dividends are likely to be lower. But since prices generally move more than is justified by the fall in dividends, the expected returns are still higher. This is a big part of why aggregate stock returns are predictable.

**TL;DR: When stock prices go down, expected returns generally go up.** (Note: the focus of this comment is the aggregate stock market, not individual stocks. And I'm not saying to buy every small dip.)

[For people who are already familiar with all this, keep in mind that this is an empirical observation. It doesn't necessarily need to be the case that discount rates are too volatile. In fact, in pre-WWII data in the US, changes in stock prices were driven more by changes to cash flows than changes to discount rates. This is also true if you look at non-US data going back several centuries. In other words, the relative importance of discount rate news is a pretty new phenomenon. One possible explanation is that equity duration has increased considerably in the past several decades due to fewer firms paying dividends. The implication for all you budding market timers is that thinking about discount rates might be more useful than poring over financial statements and forecasting earnings.]

16-02-04,444sgf,"Russia steals Saudi's crown as China’s TOP oil supplier","Moscow is gaining momentum as the biggest seller of crude oil to China, with Russian crude supplies overtaking those from Saudi Arabia.
According to data from RBC Capital Markets, the Saudi share of Chinese crude imports at the beginning of the decade was about 20 percent, while Russia's was below 7 percent. The situation has changed.
""Russia is the biggest rival to the Saudis in the single-largest oil demand growth country in the world,"" Michael Tran, RBC Capital Markets' commodity strategist told Business Insider.

""The rising tide of Chinese growth has meant that notional volumes for both countries have increased in the years since, but Russia's gains have been outsized,"" he added.

Tran said Saudi Arabia now finds itself “neck and neck with Moscow for the lead in Chinese market share, with both jostling in the 13-14percent range, yet the momentum resides with the latter.""

Over the past five years, Saudi Arabia increased exports to China by only about 120,000 barrels a day while Russia managed to increase exports by 550,000 barrels a day in the same period.

Russia managed to overtake the Saudis as the biggest crude exporter to China four times in 2015. In the past five years Saudi Arabia has lost the top spot only six times.

Statistics from China's General Administration of Customs (GAC) showed that in December Beijing bought 4.81 million tons of crude oil from Russia. The volume was up 30 percent compared with the previous year.

Imports from Saudi Arabia dropped 1.2 percent year on year to 4.47 million tons. The fall was blamed on a hike in the official Saudi selling price and the closure of several large Chinese refineries for planned overhauls.

""Saudi Arabia is losing its crown as its selling prices in Asia haven't been attractive enough,"" Gao Jian, an analyst at SCI International, a Shandong-based energy consultant, told Bloomberg back in June.
Analysts say that Russia’s readiness to accept Chinese yuan as payment for its oil is one of the key tipping points.

U.S.-based companies announced 75,114 planned job cuts last month, up more than 200 percent from a 15-year low in December, according to global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas. That figure was also 42 percent higher from a year ago.

Retailers were the biggest job cutter, despite a nearly 8 percent bump in U.S. holiday sales in 2015. The sector slashed 22,246 positions, a seven-year high.

Wal-Mart accounted for much of the payroll reductions. The nation's largest retailer said it plans to close 269 stores and expects to let go 16,000 workers.

Macy's said it will also shutter some locations this year, costing 4,820 employees their jobs.

January delivered a fresh round of energy sector layoffs, as well. Announced payroll reductions of 20,246 marked the highest monthly total since the start of the oil price rout in mid-2014 that has sent crude prices spiraling about 70 percent and led to massive cost-cutting in the U.S. oil patch.

The report was released a day before the Labor Department releases its jobs report for January. On Wednesday, ADP and Moody's Analytics reported that that job growth in the private sector slowed in January.",12

On balance, the advantages offered by Tesla cars outweigh the drawbacks for many car buyers to the extent Model S dominates the US car sales in its price range.

Given the market's irrational concern for Tesla demand due to collapsing oil prices, the company is likely undervalued at this time.

With that said, I was thinking of dropping my current 401k % from 15 to 7, as I think the market will dip in the next few weeks-months (short term). Then I began to think of taxes, as I would therefore be getting $8k more per year pre-tax. Lets say just for fun that my tax rate is about 30%, which means that I'd lose 30% of that $8k automatically. 

Now I'm thinking that it's better to leave that 15% as my 401k contribution amount as the markets would have to dip &gt;30% (I don't think that'll happen) for it to make sense to get it as cash, right?

This will effectively Wipeout my savings and im not comfortable doing that.  My question is am i able to get my deposit back. The money is still in my acct, i actually transfered the 10,000 out of my acct and into another one so that they couldnt touch it. 
1.Is that legal .
2. Since they havent taken the money out yet do they really have ""my deposit""
3. I gave them the deposit 4 days ago, there has to be a grace period no?

(average daily returns / STDEV(daily returns)) * K

I consider myself (or am trying to become) a Technical Trader, and usually make my decisions based as such.  However at times I'll read a news story on a company ive been watching, and make a decision that way as well; however it almost always ends poorly for me....

Example:  I have been following ASTI (Ascent Solar Technology); they have been all over the place (like most penny stocks) but have been trending downwards for several months...however most of the news reports posted by Yahoo, Google, etc seem to be positive  (new partnerships, government contracts, new product releases, etc.)  these have all occured within the last 3 months, yet the stock still is trending downwards....  Then on 2/1/16 I read a report with the headline ""ASTI announces strongest Quarterly product Revenue in Corp. history"", which sounds great!  I thought now was my chance to buy some shares of this stock! It jumped up 100% for literally an instant, (I got in at $0.105) However, 48 hours later, its back down to almost the same price it was before the ""positive PR""...what gives?

This is especially after NY Fed governor William Dudley’s dovish statement earlier this week. We are watching the MAR16 mini-Russell contract, and we believe it could travel higher to the 1050 range, an important prior support level. That would be a 3% rally from here.

**Bonds:** The MAR16 US bonds are down 8 ticks to 162’04, after a massive buying wave struck the market earlier this week. Tomorrow’s government issued jobs report may  provide a catalyst for another big bond move. If the jobs # is much weaker than expected tomorrow, we would not be surprised to see more bond buying.

**FX:** The MAR16 USD collapsed this week, breaking below the 200 day moving average yesterday and more so today. This shows you the acute volatile nature potential of FX. Central banker statements can rock FX markets in the blink of an eye. The MAR16 Euro popped above its 200 day moving average, and is up .7% to 111.80.

**Commodities:** MAR16 WTI crude oilis up 2.4% to $33.06, after a 9% rally yesterday. If this contract can stay above $34, we believe it is headed to $37.50. APR16 gold met our initial target of $1140, and is now at $1151. It has been supported by strong buying over the past 3 weeks. MAR15 Coffee has rallied from a key $1.15 level as well, and is now up to $1.23. We believe it may continue to rally from here.

How does decay effect options investments vs. buying and holding? 

If oil returns to $60 per barrel what would UCO value be? 

Would it be better to trade USO or some other etf hoping for a oil rebound?

I think it is a fairly safe to assume oil will return to $60 a barrel in the next 2 years. Do you guys think 2 year options on UCO would be a good investment? If yes or no please explain why.

Also can someone explain how exactly to calculate the ROI for options. Say for example buying 1000 contracts at $4.30  per contract and a strike of $10 dollars. What would the ROI be if the equity went up to $50.

Thanks.

I know you guys hate the ""Hey I'm young and poor and want to get rich, I have less than $10k, how do I do?"" posts. This isn't one of them.

Let me start by saying I'm 31 years old. I have a job in management that pays around $60-$65k a year (depending on bonuses), so I am by no means well off but I have a better than average income for my age and cost of living area (Minnesota). I am nearly debt free, plan to be completely in the black by June 2016. I have about $7k in my 401k and other than that, pretty much 0 in savings (paying down debt has been priority #1).

I've been interested in the market for a long time. A few years ago I took $1000 and dabbled in penny stocks, mainly Fannie Mae and made about $400 when they rebounded after showing a profit and paying back the Fed. Then I got greedy a lost a little on other penny stocks (FNMA was an obvious fluke but my success made me blind to that). Ended up with about $900 of my original $1000. So I noped out of penny stocks really quick after being ""burnt"" (I know $100 isn't a lot to lose but after being up 40% it made me very gun shy). I know I am very lucky not to have lost more, I was reading all the pumper newsletters and listening to that famous short-seller (I forget his name, kind of a pompous young guy who was featured as a child market prodigy on TV), watching his videos and got pretty enamored with it all until my common sense kicked in and I pulled out completely.

That was my first time trading, and now I'm starting to get into the meat of it all, the wise way to invest. Looking at different industries, financials, doing my research on ""actual"" companies, etc. I have a few hundred dollars that I'm playing around with on Robin Hood, but nothing serious yet. I own a little Microsoft and Sirius XM. Was thinking getting into the ""sin stocks"" because we appear to be in a bear market.

Honestly though, I'm clueless still. I just want to learn, and someday (not tomorrow, not next year, probably not till I'm 40 or older) I'd like to be able to be good at this so I'm not working till I'm 70. Like I said, I'm 31 with almost no savings. It's not too late for me yet but if I don't start soon, it will be.

I see people on here say ""no one knows how to use Google"". Well every time I Google I get inundated with swaths of articles from hundreds of publications, I have no idea if they are legit, I have no idea where their interests lay. I try to go to Yahoo or TheStreet and look at financials, I sort of know what I'm looking at but defining whether something is a ""buy"" or not, in my own terms, is seriously overwhelming.

And, I'd like to be able to do it myself. I know someone is going to say ""Invest in mutual funds or bonds, or get a broker when you have enough money"" and I understand that logic. But I want to go high risk, I'm not scared of losing money. I am ready to rock.

So, I guess what I'm asking is where to go to learn for someone like me. Are their apprenticeships out there that a guy like me who has no financial back round or schooling could do? I know a degree in finance or economics would be helpful, but I also know there are a lot of people out there who learned on their own. How did they do it? Who helped them? I know everyone likes to tout about like they did it all themselves, but seriously, everyone needs a mentor. Who was yours?

Any advice would be great. I have read article after article, Googled a thousand ticker numbers, I've been listening to Investor's Edge religiously, so now what.

Where do I go now?",7

I'm currently in a 400 level economic forecasting class as a sophomore. Our first assignment is predicting the interest rate of a 30 year treasury bond using Forecastx (knowledge of the software is not necessary for my question). We are free to choose how far back our data goes and what model we use. I'm looking for advice on what model and data set (roughly) will yield the best results. The professor says the less experienced students (directed at me being the only sophomore in the class) are free to just use a ""same-as-last"" model; however, I do not want to use that as an excuse to turn in a sub-par project. Any help to stick it to this passively-aggressive teacher is greatly appreciated!

Since Japan has a negative interest rate right now and the US raised interests rates despite the lack of inflation, wouldn't it be a relatively safe bet to say the US may see deflation/low inflation and Japan will see inflation? 

If that is the case, wouldn't it be a good/sure investment to borrow from Japan to invest in US bonds? You could borrow the Yen while it is at peak buying power, and exchange it for dollars which will likely increase in buying power, then earn interest on the bonds. The exchange rate would be favorable at the start and then due to the central banks influence and some time, favorable the opposite direction down the road. Finally you get to collect interest on the bonds as well.

I know that there is no such thing as a free lunch and I'm not sure if I can even feasibly do this  as an individual investor but the news about Japan's negative interest rates got me thinking about this. I fully expect to be told why I'm wrong, but I'm curious to know why.",3

The liberals are in charge and the province of quebec where they are based is controlled by the liberal government. Historically the liberals are more inclined to save this line of business over oil companies in alberta because they expect oil companies to be scooped up by multinational conglomerates from the u.s england australia and to a lesser extent china. So the stock is technically a penny stock. There is a reverse split coming to preserve its obligation to stay on the tsx you need to stay above a $1. So basically i know im new and i wanted to know also what the iirov certification will let me do? Right now the bank gave me a margin i can use but i have 10k in capital most of which im playing for hydro one. But i want to learn more about those other things where the risk is higher. The ones where you buy contracts not just the security itself but im always confused hearing about puts and calls. Is there a forum i can visit that teaches a laymen like me what im building toward?  Thanks for reading everyone :),1

16-02-05,448beu,A Deadly Sin Of Trading Stocks,"As a trader you probably have heard people talking of cutting losses quickly and managing ones emotions, but what does this really mean??? It's hard for people to understand until they really experience it for themselves. This is why I feel all new traders should not only spend some time paper trading, but also a period of time trading a small account with real money on the line. This of course only should be after they have thoroughly educated themselves because the reality is if you go into the market with no understanding of what you are getting involved in, you have a 99.9% of losing.

You can say if XYZ stock goes against me I'm going to stop out at $X.XX, but unless you have a hard stop (which isn't always possible) or you've used certain techniques to train yourself to stick to your mental stops, when push comes to shove, it's very unlikely you will follow your plan. The big reason for this is that human beings do not like to admit they are wrong and accept loses. 

99% of the time if you ask an untrained individual why they are holding onto losers they will tell you the stock(s) blew through there stop and they didn't have time to get executed. Then they told themselves they would sell on the first bounce back to their entry but either that point came to quickly or the stock never made it all the way back to their entry. This is so common and if you have any experience in the market I am sure you have experienced this before. Most people are guilty of one of the deadly sins of trading known as averaging down.

In the beginning nearly every new trader wants to wait for breakeven. I know I did and it definitely took some time to overcome this. Unfortunately it's just human nature, but I can tell you that this is an incredibly unhealthy and counter productive way to behave. What makes the situation even more difficult is that sometimes right after you stop out and take a loss a stock will reverse and do exactly what you expected. This is certainly irritating for sure but the truth is that situations like this are factored into a successful persons trading plan. 

Basically what this means is you have already factored in that you may lose $X.XX and therefore the loss is negligible and actually a necessity. This is mainly because successful trading is based on probabilities and the risk/reward dynamic. What I mean by this is you are never going to win 100% of the time and you cannot earn more than the risk free rate (currently about 2%), unless you accept risk. Anyone who thinks that some holy grail system  exists, is only fooling themselves. In fact in certain markets successful traders only win 30% of the time. My system win's about 65-70% of the time but thankfully that's more than enough of an edge to come out ahead day in and day out.  

Losses really are the key to success. When I accepted this fact that to make tens of thousands I would have to take some losses along the way, my trading account literally started to grow exponentially. Embrace the fact that taking calculated losses is okay, and start profiting in penny stocks and more.

Currently there are about 75 stores (compare that to Chipotle's 2000+ stores) so there is a lot of room to expand, although new stores are not opening as fast as competitors Five Guys and Sonic. Stock has beat earnings expectations over the past 4Q, and analysts are predicting what seems to me to be wild - albeit perhaps justified - 2x digit growth over the next 5 years (analysts are marking it as a HOLD right now). On the other side of the coin, insiders are dumping the stock way more than they are buying it and I haven't performed a rigorous analysis of its balance sheet.

16-02-05,44a1bn,"How I feel about Vanguard, RobinHood, and OptionsHouse","My personal experience is very limited, but I have a Vanguard, a RobinHood account, and an OptionsHouse account.


I've put $50 away a week, every week, for the last 7 months (got my first job and decided to save for my future) the account is currently at $2,000. With $2150 in deposits. (math doesn't add up because when I first opened the account I put some money in to start) The account itself is down $150 and this is my worst performing account.


Next up is my RobhinHood account. I have 3.5K in it, with a lifetime-to-date earning of $50. RobinHood is great and all, my complaint is not about RobinHood but more for stocks in general. It is insanely hard to profit (at least for me) with the stupid T+3 rule, where it takes like 3 days to use that money to buy again. It's fucked me one too many times. I am getting some mad gainz and I don't want to sell quite yet cause I think it'll keep going up in the next few days. It goes down, I'm fucked. I'm holding a loser and decide to sell it (cut my losses) then within 3 days a great opportunity comes and I'm fucked because I literally can't invest in it. RobinHood is tough, man.


My OptionsHouse account is up 1 grand to date, with initial contributions of $650. I don't do the sickest yolo plays, but the quick gains and accessibility makes it very easy to trade. Options take 1 day to settle (I believe?) Not having a 3 day waiting period makes it so much easier to do things. It makes it easier to cut losses short, collect or gains, or let gains ride, etc. I personally believe anyone who tells ya ""I don't do options because it's risky gambling"" isn't giving you a good view on the topic. The way I feel about it, if I put 3K in robinhood, I could potentially lose 1.5~2k (see SUNE) or potentially gain that much. But due to the T+3 rule, or the general difficulty that comes associated to losses (like always wanting to hold it because it ""might go back up"") I feel like when you buy one contract for like $250~ you're essentially doing the same thing. A 3K investment in stocks could get you +-5~10%. But I've gotten fucked before, and lost the majority of my investment. Like when SUNE went from $10 to like $7. Or when GoPro went from $17 down to $10. I just keep getting fucked back to back, I'm glad I managed to recover. But I feel buying a single options contract ($250~) would give you the same gains/losses of $3000 in stocks, without actually risking that $3000.


Anyone else think like I do? Or think I'm incredibly wrong and stupid?

16-02-05,44dj2p,How much would I have made?,"I'm new to stocks and recently have been trading on a paper money simulator - Trading212. 

I nearly deposited £150 today but backed out due to having no balls to lose that money with my limited understanding... If you're going to get fucked, you at least want to know who's doing it right?

So I saw the stock at around 1pm at (this isn't exact at all - memory) 1151. It has now finished trading at around 1171 (lets hypothetically say that is an EXACT 20 point(?) difference).

How much money would I have made? If I did invest, I would have put at least £25 in with a maximum of £50. 

To give some background, I downloaded the app after some guys at my work talked about it. I made £17,000 profit (after starting with £10k) within the first day from RISKY investments in gold and it's the only one that worked for me.

If anyone could show me how you work it out that would be great.

Cheers!

16-02-05,44c9fl,Maybe semi long term oil yolo...(DO),"Diamond Offshore reports Monday.

They have 20 rigs in service, of which over half (11) have contracts expiring this year, or have already expired in 2015/un-contracted.

[Here](http://www.diamondoffshore.com/Documents/Rig%20Report/DORigStatus.xlsx) is the fleet status report.

It bottomed at 15.55 in the worst part of January before recovering into the low 20s.  Before the oil crash it was a 54 dollar stock, it's now hovering around 18 bucks.  Currently this makes for a decline of 67%, roughly.

As a comparison, RIG has fallen by 78% (45 per share down to 10 dollars per share) with a debt situation roughly double as bad as Diamond's (RIG has a market cap of ~4b and a total outstanding debt of ~8b and is also slightly cash flow negative, compared to DO's debt/market cap being relatively even with the company slightly cash flow negative).  The market perception seems to be that RIG and SDRL might not survive this downturn without dilution or selling themselves off, which makes DO the long term winner when oil turns around and explains why they've gotten some analyst upgrades in the past week or two.

As of right now you could straddle 12.5 and 22.5 for January next year for right at 4 bucks.  As volatile as oil is shaping up to be I wouldn't be surprised to see both sides of that trade pay off.  At worst, considering there will be a move one way or the other after Monday in all likelihood, you wind up with a free/cheap long term call or put.",10

16-02-06,44fdff,Line of credit to invest?,"Hi all,
Sorry if it is a bit of a silly question. Situation: 20s, in canada, have access to professoonal student line of credit, no debt, no need to repay loans until 9-10 years from now, 100k+ guaranteed after school, loc interest rate 2.75%, can take out up to 275k.thinking of taking 75k and investing in us equities. Start w index funds, maybe pick a couple of stocks. Good idea? 

Everything i seem to read indicates doing this early on and just holding for many years is a good idea. Some speculation that i think supports this: Canada is in recession so interest rates unlikely to rise in near term. Dont believe CAD will get stronger as oil is mostly done in the immediate and probably longterm if people sufficiently shit their pants over global warming and alternative energy tech improves. Hence US equities.

Any thoughts appreciated.

Edit: appreciate the words of caution. I think i'll sit tight and just read more about investing for the time being.",5

* In my 30's
* 500K USD in liquid savings
* Monthly expenses 6K USD (average based on past 24 months)
* Current income of 10K USD
* no house

From my reading, retirement planners/calculators say to assume 3% inflation, and that I should aim for 5% ROI minimum to cover inflation plus additional return.

Even if lost my job with no severance, I would be able to retire now and maintain same lifestyle until death of any age, since the ROI after inflation would be 10K, correct?

I understand to be safe, I should try to increase that gap to cover years of greater inflation or lower ROI. But it seems the way I am understanding it, even at 6% inflation and 3% ROI, a -3% adjusted return would still allow me to live until I'm close to 90.

Also i understand this situation does not allow for me to make any big lump sum payments, such as buying a house. But aside from that, all else would likely be OK it seems.

16-02-06,44ge2z,Question from a Newbie,"Hello everyone. Hoping someone can guide me a bit and give me some suggestions of what you would do in my situation. I am a US citizen living outside of the states in Costa Rica. I have time and energy but not a lot of money. I have a small business that covers my expenses and bills and is growing well. I don't have a lot of extra money, but a little each month to ""play"" with so to speak. Let's say I have a couple of hundred dollars now. I want to know the best way to use this money. Remember, I am new but I have time and I love learning. If you can just make a suggestion of where/how I should invest, I am hopeful I can learn all about it before diving in. I am just not sure where to start. I hear penny stocks, but then I read negatives. If you have any ideas, I would love to hear from you. Thanks so much for any and all help, guidance and suggestions! Happy Saturday :)

Edit: Would love to hear high-risk and low-risk. I don't really want to lose all my money, clearly, but I wouldn't mind taking some risks too because this isn't money I need or couldn't lose as long as I am learning. :)

Edit: Hmm...this also leads me to thinking...maybe someone can give advice on this also.... Again, I am new for sure, so I am currently putting books on my tablet to start reading..haha
How much money would be a good starting point? Let's say I saved for a few months....$1000? I guess my question is this. If you could start all over knowing what you now know, how much money would you want (realistically...this is kind of a bogus idea I know) and how would you start getting in the game? Please keep in mind, though, I am looking more for short term than long term...not looking to build my retirement fund, more like add some extra money to my vacation fund. :) I figure with all this information and research, I must be months away from even thinking about trying anything out...ha! Thanks everyone...loving the discussion.

But I have taken $2500 portfolios up to $15000, pulled money out and seen every fucking balance in between.

I am wrapping up my masters in accounting this spring, and should pass the CPA exam by 2017 busy season.

As always, go fuck yourselves/eat a box of cocks/etc. But also give me advice. I trust strangers more than friends/SOs, because you have no reason to lie. 

Edit: removed the income amount because its kind of irrelevant and the responses/pms hyping /r/personalfinance are killing my buzz. 

EDIT2: The expenses I mentioned are actually wrong too.  It would be less, since I am an idiot and my drunk math included gas, which would be way lower since current car gets 16-17mpg on premium.  

Edit3: I want to clarify some of my other responses.  I do not hate my current job in IT, I actually enjoy it.  The problem is, I don't like the potential landing spots above my current position, and I don't wan't to stay in my current position and limit my earnings potential, so that's why I will be going into accounting after my masters is done and I can take the CPA exam.

(Ball park),"Hi I am a newbie in my twenties but have been talking to some people who have $100-500 dividend stock coming in monthly but scheduling new quarterly paying stock on a monthly basis. I never really thought about dividends really being much of an option to actually be able to pay a bill for the average Joe who is only making 20-40,000 a year. Once person said he gets $100-200 on quarterly stocks that he only spent $500 on. When I asked for more details, as usual people get hazy past the bragging stage. 

I'm curious on a realistic basis how much do you REALLISTICALLY NEED TO SPEND to get back $100 quarterly pay out or if annual pay outs or better? It seems to me if it were that easy everyone would be doing it or he was lying or conveniently forgetting EVERYTHING he spent to get to this point.

16-02-06,44i8ic,Stock returns over the long term,"Many investors have the idea that as long they are investing for the long term, they can rely on stocks to provide a solid return. After all the historical return on stocks has been roughly in the high single digits. They look at historical returns for US stocks over the past 100 years and while there are occasional crashes, the overall trend is ever rising.

One key point that many investors forget is the impact of inflation on returns. Once you adjust your returns properly for inflation, you will see more clearly that stocks do go up over time, but are hardly as safe as people come to believe even over horizons of 10 or 20 or more years. 

Here is a chart of inflation adjusted US stock returns. (S&amp;P would have been better, but the DJIA makes essentially the same point).

http://www.macrotrends.net/1319/dow-jones-100-year-historical-chart

Try clicking on the inflation-adjustment check box to see the difference between real and nominal returns.

**Edit:** Here is the S&amp;P with dividends (nominal and real). Unfortunately this one only starts in 1950, but it still makes the point that stock returns don't deliver consistent performance even over long horizons. Performance was strong in the 1950s to mid-1960s and very strong from the early 1980s to 2000, but otherwise hasn't been fantastic.

16-02-06,44h70v,YOLO Opportunity: VRX,"VRX has earnings on 2/22.  Now normally I don't think a single earnings call could completely collapse a stock into penny stock range. However, VRX, obviously down sharply since Summer may have a lot further to fall. If earnings miss I believe it will hit 60ish before Summer.  If you look at the charts VRX has respected it's major Fib levels very accurately (red and green lines), holding it's monthly 89ema perfectly (also a fib), and is currently forming a very tight symmetrical triangle on the daily. My prediction is it will stagnate here for a while until earnings, giving you plenty of time to find a good entry point.  Now, of course earnings could be a hit and the stock could rally, but it isn't a YOLO without some risk.  My guess is this stock will hit 60 by Spring, then Ackman will be forced to unload due to disgruntled investors sending this stock to sub 10.

TL;DR - VRX down a lot, at a major inflection point, could collapse. Short.

16-02-06,44h9ao,Fingerprint Cards (FINGB.ST): Banks purposefully suppress share price through shorting and low fair value analysis? Anyone have experience with similar cases?,"For those not familiar with Fingerprint Cards $FING-B:ST, they are a Swedish company that makes the excellent fingerprint sensors you know from Nexus-phones, Huawei and basically any phone worth owning apart from Apple and Samsung. They were the fastest growing company in Europe in 2015, and at one point, the stock had increased almost 2700 % in a year (25 SEK to 680 SEK). They are exponentially increasing their revenue, so the fundamentals are rock solid. And yet, no one knows what the share price is worth: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-26/fingerprint-cards-value-is-anyone-s-guess-as-analysts-differ

The stock was short-attacked in October 2015 from 530 SEK to 300 SEK (over 40 %) in one day (!), without negative news. Many have speculated that this was done in order to knock out Bull-warrants and Bull-certificates that were becoming too expensive for the banks as the stock just kept rising.

As of writing this, 8.5 % of shares are shorted by big banks, and the stock has fallen from 680 SEK to about 380 SEK. Despite record earnings and a constant positive news stream. Forward PE is now around 10 because of this. In an exponentially growing company with near a monopoly on Android fingerprint sensors, excluding Samsung, this is ridiculously low.

This has sparked a huge discussion whether or not banks are purposefully suppressing the share price by shorting and providing false analysis (Like the ridiculous 200 SEK price target from a certain bank). All so the big banks can profit from shorting and buy in again at cheaper levels.

I'm heavily invested in this company, so I'm asking for advice: Do anyone have experience with stocks attacked in a similar way? Did the stock price ever recover? Is it even legal to do what the banks are doing?


TLDR: Banks suppressing share price in an exponentially growing tech company to the extent that forward PE is now 10. Is it legal? Anyone have experience with similar cases?

16-02-07,44j8xy,Suck my DISH,"Dish Network is being [sued for more than its market cap](http://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/satellite-tv-provider-dish-could-face-24b-fines-sales-calls-n502326) for violating Do Not Call laws. Analysts don't seem to give a shit about this in their reports.

They admit to breaking the law, but are whining that they should only get a slap on the wrist, because it was only 55 million illegal robocalls and other people only got their wrists slapped. The market seems to be expecting a slap on the wrist.

So, in 2 weeks, two things are happening:

1) The trial is expected to end (it started around Jan 21st, expected to last 4 weeks)

2) Their earnings announcement is 2/18. Analysts have a huge range, [from (0.45) a share to 0.83 a share](https://finance.yahoo.com/q/ae?s=DISH). 

If DISH gets fined more than a token amount (and the DOJ seems to be really serious about this), and their earnings come in on the lower end of expectations, expect this stock to shit the bed.

Best-case scenario: both hit on the same day, and the stock gets pounded in the ass. Yachts for everyone. Worst-case scenario: the DOJ pussies out and they beat estimates, and you get pounded in the ass instead.",56

16-02-06,44hmnc,Startup Equity Problem,"Interesting long story short, I have been given 1% of a startup's equity due to my contributions in its early stages.  They've already incorporated, and have given me 2 options to take control of my 1% of the company.


First option: Nonvested Restricted Stock

From what I understand, I wouldn't be able to access this stock until the startup exits via IPO/sale. I would also get diluted (along with the founders) whenever they raise capital. Lastly and what i'm most worried about, I would have to pay income tax on the stock this year.


Second option: Nonqualified Stock Option Grant

This has no restrictions on it and locks in an exercise price today that would be redeemable forever at that price. Not sure what else holds true for this option.


Basically i'm generally interested in, for lack of a more educated standpoint, which option to choose. I'm particularly interested in the tax implications of the restricted stock - what percentage of what value would I have to pay income taxes on? Also, if I feel that the company has a real chance at failure, would it make sense to avoid the first option for then I would have the risk of paying taxes on something that in the end is worthless? 

Any insight is greatly appreciated, and I would love it if you recognized any more questions that you think I need to answer before making a sound decision on which option to take.

Thank you!!",11

As far as gains and losses, I am UP according to the documentation provided. However it explicitly states on the report that Gains/Losses are not reported to the IRS.

At first, I was assuming that since I was UP I needed to pay some taxes on gains. However it looks like paying taxes is not required in my current situation.

16-02-06,44hq9o,"Small cap long term oil yolo, looking out for the Robinhooders...(GIFI)","[GIFI](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=GIFI)

Note that the zero on their debt line is not accurate as of last week, they closed on a buyout of a private shipyard that gives them another location along the Houston -&gt; NOLA coast.

That buyout was financed for 20 million dollars, which actually turned out to be 18.4 million, the seller owed them 1.6 million at the closing due to uncollected receivables.

I was able to check with the company and verify that GIFI assumed no debt from the company they bought, the 20 million borrowed for the purchase of the other company is the only debt involved, and the 1.6 million owed from the seller, I'm told, was put toward that debt, reducing the total amount borrowed to 18.4 million.

The acquisition was not a large one, the facilities increase the capacity of GIFI for various projects by what appear to be about 10%.  The big thing was adding a location in Lake Charles, LA.  GIFI already has a presence in Houma, LA (close to NOLA) and Houston.  Lake Charles is halfway in between those two.  The other company was more of a shipyard than a rig fabricator, whereas GIFI is more of a rig fabricator than a shipyard.  This merger also expands their services offered due to that.

[Here's the 8K on the acquisition](http://biz.yahoo.com/e/160104/gifi8-k.html)

This company was a 30-35 dollar stock prior to the 2014 crash, now trading at 9.

I would point to analyst ringing the bells on companies like ESV, SDRL, RIG, etc in saying that those companies have debt levels that might not allow them to survive without dilution or selling themselves off.

This small company has more cash on hand than total debt (a third of their share price is in cash), all of their equipment is paid for, and all of their property and buildings are paid for but for the ~18 million from the recent buyout.

Personal opinion:  If fracking stays dead, any price recovery will benefit offshore services first and foremost.  Offshore has a lower cost of production than fracking, and should recover first when oil turns around.  Companies like this benefit from capex expenditure of larger oil companies, so tend to be early in line when oil rebounds for increased profits.

The founder of this company also founded Tidewater (TDW) and [ODECO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ODECO) (which was later merged with Diamond Offshore).  Family members of the founder are still on the board.  They are not new to this business.",31

16-02-07,44l52m,Is Whirlpool a good buy?,"Whirlpool (WHR), the largest home appliances manufacturer in the world, is up slightly after announcing upbeat earnings for the fourth quarter and full year 2015.  For the full year revenues at constant currencies increased by 18% which, along with improved cost efficiencies, allowed earnings to increase from $783m to$650m (EPS rose 20% from $8.17 to $9.83. Guidance for 2016 forecast EPS of between $11.25 to $12.00 with the ongoing business (excluding one off charges and expense) expected to earn between $14.00 and $14.75.
Despite this the stock price closed down 37% from its 52 week high on Friday 5th at $137.74.  Putting the company on a PE ratio of 14.01 - pretty miserable for a company that has grown earnings by over 20% and expects to repeat the performance.
Investors may be wary of the macroeconomic slowdown but WHR has a history of improving earnings even when sales struggle by cutting costs.  Demonstrated by earnings growth of 50% between 2008 and 2014 when revenues only grew 5%.
The company has increased its foothold significantly in Europe and China through the acquisition of Indesit and Hefei Sanyo in 2014 offering good growth and cost cutting potential. While the risk of a slowdown in China remains manageable with Asia only accounting for 5.6% of sales.",2

however, this investment does not generate any cash flows for me. I can only get profit if I sell it at the higher price.

&gt;The Index Fund Bubble And What It Means

&gt;Finally, Bill Ackman has some insightful comments about the “bubble” in indexing. Given the lousy performance of active managers over the past decade, it’s easy to see why investors continue to flock to index funds. They are cheaper in terms of fees, more tax efficient and have had better returns of late.

&gt;But here’s the problem. Indexing only works when their are a sufficient number of active managers to make the market at least semi-efficient. If everyone becomes a passive indexer, then the returns of the major indexes will start to lag in a major way as the stocks in the index become overowned and overpriced.

&gt;But there are other considerations too. Passive ownership essentially gives management a free pass and allows lousy management teams to stay entrenched.",72

Later the company is at $70, you want to exercise the call option, but you'd have to buy more shares than you can afford (since the options are way more than 40 shares). What happens then? Does it expire because you don't have money? 

I've also seen 'sell to close' but I'm not sure what that is. Is it you selling your call to someone else (and later having to sell them the shares) or is it just ending that trade without buying the stocks and taking a whatever the profit was?

Also if you had the money to exercise, which one would give you a bigger profit, exercising or selling to close?

Phil Fisher makes no sense to me when he talks about holding a core of stocks.  It is something talked about by many mutual funds, Buffet, and financial institutions.

I understand the thinking completely, I hear it regurgitated over and over.  But if I see company A is what I believe to be undervalued, and I already own growing but overvalued competitor B, I'm probably still going to buy company A if it 1: Pays a dividend, 2: Is wrongfully undervalued, 3: Not going bankrupt in the foreseeable future.  And I'll probably end up owning 50 stocks to do it, but if I keep buying for the long, long term I don't really see a reason not to do it (as long as I keep track of when to SELL, which I think is Fisher's main point.)

If I buy an option, and then later sell said option before it expires who is responsible if the option is exercised by the person who bought it from me? Me or the original seller? 

If I buy a call option for xyz for $100 a share and then want to exercise the option when the stock hits $150 a share, with TD Ameritrade would I need to have the capital in my margin account to purchase the 100 shares for $100 before I can just immediately flip to sell it, is is this more of an automated process of sorts?

16-02-08,44qkip,Four reasons the January jobs report is fishy,"Private education
The government said so-called private educational services eliminated 29,000 jobs — an unusually high number for a category of work that rarely gets any mention.
Some economists wonder if new federal rule changes cracking down on for-profit institutions triggered the decline. The Labor Department blamed higher than normal seasonal layoffs.
Whatever the case, the jobs report would have met Wall Street expectations for a 180,000 gain absent the odd decline in private-education employment.
Manufacturing mojo?
By virtually all accounts, U.S. manufacturers are struggling to grow amid a decline in exports and a big drop in demand among energy producers. Yet the industry supposedly added 29,000 new jobs in January to mark the biggest gain in 14 months.
Believable? Many economists are skeptical. And even if the job increases are real, some predict hiring will slow again next month. After all, manufacturers only added 33,000 jobs all of 2015.
White-collar woes
Businesses and professional firms that employ white-collar workers added only 9,000 jobs last month, the smallest gain in more than two years.

Quite a comedown for a segment of the economy that has led the way in job creation during the recovery. These jobs increased by an average of 52,000 a month in 2015.

The poor performance can be blamed on a sharp decline in temp jobs after the end of the holiday season — they fell 25,000 last month. But it was still a surprisingly weak number that will raise eyebrows if it persists.
Retailer rebound
Retailers didn’t add as many workers as expected for the holiday season. No surprise. Sales at most traditional retailers such as Macy’s M, -1.18%   have been surprisingly soft as consumers save up or seek better deals online.

So how to explain a whopping 58,000 gain in January that led all industries? That was the biggest gain in almost four years. Even more surprising, department stores added the most new jobs in the retail sector: 15,000. The last time they hired that many people was at the end of 2013.

Every so often a monthly employment report is full of so many irregularities that it pays to discount the report. This might be one of those times.

“It just seems there is a lot of stuff in this report that makes you think it’s an anomaly,” said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist of TD Ameritrade.",0

16-02-08,44phyd,Are Mutual Funds Tax Inefficient?,"I recently got some tax forms and am baffled as to how a mutual fund can be advantageous given what appears to be a tax inefficiency. Case in point - VWUSX, a Vanguard fund, traded at say $33 near the end of 2015. One day it dropped 8% in one day. I quickly figured out this was a capital gains distribution. So, the stock drops 8%. That 8% goes into cash in my account. Since I have my settings set to reinvest, that 8% was reinvested at $33 x .92. Now, my tax forms say I have to pay tax on that 8% capital gains distribution.

This is utterly baffling and I have scoured the internet and found no sufficient explanation for how this makes sense. These are called ""capital gains distributions"" but I have not gained anything - I was simply given my money back to me, which I then had the option to reinvest, or not reinvest. If I had the choice, I would simply opt to NEVER receive a capital gains distribution in a mutual fund would I not!? It's not like Vanguard said to me ""hey we had gains this year of 8% (whatever ""gains"" mean), so here, here's 8% of your money back, and x% beyond that, and you'll pay tax on that x%."" Instead,
Vanguard said ""hey, we made some gains, here's 10% OF YOUR OWN MONEY BACK, WITH NOTHING ADDITIONAL, which you will have to then pay tax on.""

16-02-08,44q713,My brush with insider trading since some other shithead mentioned it.,"So way back in 2000 during the dot com end days, I worked at a software company.  They were a legal/tax publisher of sorts, and I was in the IT side, on the crew that came in during the evenings to fix shit, upgrade servers, test things, and what not.  Hey fuck off, I was in my mid 20s then, fresh out of college.

Anyways, one day about 8pm I get a call.  The security guard is on the other end, he gets the main office calls after hours.  He says he has someone who needs to send a fax and he doesn't know where to send them.  I take the call from the security guard to see what's up.

On the other end of the line is some random woman who says she needs to send a fax to the corporate counsel's private line.  I tell her I don't have that number, and his office is surely locked, so I dunno what you want me to do lady, try back tomorrow.  She doesn't wanna take no for an answer, she suggests faxing it to me, and then I go slide it under his door.  Sure whatever, go ahead.

A couple of minutes go by, the fax is coming in, but that fucker sure is printing a shitload of paper, what the fuck is she sending me?  I go over and take a look, **THIS CRAZY BITCH IS SENDING ME THE CONTRACT TO BUY OUT THE WHOLE FUCKING COMPANY, WITH NOTES/NEGOTIATIONS IN THE MARGINS.** Wt actual fuck is wrong with her?  How did she get through law school?  Nevermind get me to the page with the price on it.  I'm pulling on the fucking pages, trying to get them out faster.  At the time it was rumored that we were on our last 90 days worth of cash, the stock was down from a high of 15 bucks to around 1.50 iirc.  We weren't on fuckedcompany.com yet, but we were sure as hell flirting with it every goddamned day.

Before I get to the price page, my phone rings again.  I go back to pick it up and just as I'm hanging up the call my boss walks in.  He chit chats a second, asks a couple questions, I'm quick and to the point and pretending to be busy so he'll go away.  The whole time I'm trying to play it cool the fax is printing its ass off, I know he's gonna notice.

Just as he's getting ready to walk away, he says ""wtf is up with that huge ass fax coming in?  No one faxes stuff to us.""  I told him the truth in a roundabout way...*""oh, no big deal, someone was trying to send something to this guy upstairs and their fax is busted up there so they called down and asked me to take it and stick it under his door.""*

As my phone rings again, the fax stops, and he goes to look at it.  MOTHERFUCKER.  He reads the cover page, takes the whole stack of paper, and heads out the door and down the hall while I'm on the phone.  He knows, or maybe he's too stupid to snoop?  I call security back after getting off the phone, I wanna know where this fucker is.  *""Hey did you see where Bob went on your cameras?  He left while I was on the phone and I needed to ask him something.""* The guard says ""oh yeah, he slid some paper under Skip's (the corporate counsel's nickname) door and left.""

Since the early days of Silicon Valley with Shockley Semiconductor, Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel, our tech industry has been intertwined with venture capitalists &amp; wall street. Technology companies need access to cash to fund the engineering efforts. VC’s are only too happy to supply the funds in hope of future payoffs. When that payoff happens in the form of an IPO, Wall Street too gets their pound of flesh. Over the years, asset management companies, LBO specialists, investment bankers, hedge funds &amp; private equity funds too got involved in the game by investing in private &amp; public companies, taking the public companies private, buybacks, special dividends, divestitures, spin-offs, mergers, etc. – quite a financial engineering bouquet.

16-02-08,44qbet,No matter how much I read about backwardation and contango it just brings up MORE questions. Someone ELI5?,"I was reading [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3ifwt8/timeline_of_contango_effect_on_uso_oil_etf/cug6bad)

&gt;Here's the problem: oil is in what's called ""contango"" right now -- that means the contracts for delivery far in the future are more expensive than contracts for delivery next month. 

This means people think the spot price of oil will rise in higher than the future, no? 

&gt;For example, WTI for delivery this October is at $39.32, the contract for delivery next October is at $45.15, and October 2017 is $50.55. (full table here). So if prices stay the same, then the twelfth contract you bought for $45.55/bl eventually becomes the eighth contract ($43.81/bl at current prices) and then eventually becomes the third contract ($40.66) which eventually becomes the front contract ($39.32) if you (or USO for you) is still holding it. 

Why would your future contract decrease in price at all? I don't get that. Isn't a future an agreement between you and the other party that you will get oil at a specific price in 2017? 

Even if you DIDNT want to hold that oil you can sell it on the market for whatever premium you will get over the spot price; no? Why would it decrease in price? It would only decrease in price if the underlying spot price turned out to be less than the futures contract price you agreed on, no?


&gt;If current price structure stays the same, then you've spent $45.55 today to get $39.32 a year from now -- a return of -13.6%.

Here's another one from SA

&gt;When markets are in contango, investors in futures or futures-based ETFs like the United States Oil Fund (NYSEARCA:USO) can lose money. It’s axiomatic, but we still get a surprising amount of e-mail from folks who simply think this is a myth. So let’s walk it through. Let’s suppose that you (or the fund you own, such as USO) is holding the March oil contract (the “front month,” in futures terminology). As the expiration date approaches, you have to sell that contract. If you don’t, you’ll have to take delivery of physical oil in Cushing, Okla.—and let’s be honest, no one wants to do that. So you sell the March contract and buy the April contract. This is called “rolling” the position, and it’s what most traditional commodity ETFs, including USO, do. Now suppose that “spot” oil is trading for $75/barrel.** As the March contract approaches expiration, its price will converge with the spot price.**

why would the March contract converge with the spot price??? By definition is a future is an agreement to deliver the commodity at a specific price in the future(now the present as time moves forward to March)


&gt;That’s the way the commodities market works. But if the markets are in contango, the April contract will cost more; say, $80/barrel. You don’t lose any money when you sell the March contract and buy the April contract; you simply own fewer contracts at a higher price. The trouble happens over the next month. **If the spot price of oil stays flat at $75/barrel, the value of that April contract will slowly decay from $80/barrel to $75/barrel.**

Why would it decay to $75? Let's say I'm an oil seller on the other end of the contract, as time approaches. According to the contract I am getting $5 extra over the spot price by forcing the other party to purchase it for $80. Making it worth $80 if I were to sell it on the market, no?

The person who purchased the contract would be losing money though.

16-02-08,44ro8v,Fiat Chrysler shares fall as safety investigation widens,"Shares of Fiat Chrysler fell more than 7% on Monday as an investigation into its vehicles widened.
The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) doubled its investigation to cover 856,000 Jeeps, but has not requested a recall.
The investigation focuses on the cars' electronic gear shift, which lights up when moved from one gear to another, rather than making a physical click.
Some say this means drivers cannot tell whether or not it is in drive mode.
A Fiat Chrysler spokesman said the company ""is cooperating fully"".
The investigation covers 2014 and 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokees and 2012 through 2014 Dodge Charger and Chrysler 300 sedans.
According to the NHTSA, drivers' inability to tell whether the car is in drive mode or not has allegedly led to 117 crashes.
The NHTSA is assessing ""the scope, frequency, and safety-related consequences of the alleged defect"".
Other concerns
In July, Fiat Chrysler was forced to recall 1.4 million Jeeps after it was revealed that the car's computer systems could be hacked. The company faced a record $105m (£72m) fine for failing to recall those cars from the road sooner.
The current investigation is not related to those issues, but has rattled investors.

16-02-09,44wbtl,Would Bernie Sanders Kill Trading As We Know It?,"Looking at Bernie's policies though, things like a financial transaction tax would kill day trading as trading commissions would increase ten fold. A futures contract with a face value of 100k per 1 lot (fairly typical) you be an additional $5-$10 a round turn. So around $12 a round turn for discounted professional traders. Probably $15-$18 for retail traders.

This would eliminate all forms of spread trading and intraday trading as a viable option. 

The lack of liquidity in the markets would be staggering. I won't go in to the damage this will cause to the US economy as a whole as institutions will find it far far harder to hedge exposure. Believe it or not.. futures markets arent just there as our play thing, they serve a vital hedging tool (over 98% of the largest 500 companies in the world use futures as a hedging tool) which will now lose all liquidity as short term traders find trading too expensive.

Then add in all the ""Wall Street Taxes"" and brokers and clearers will pass this on to investors. So not just day traders but fees will go up dramatically on your pension plans and mortgages and any other form of credit as hedging costs go through the roof. ",0

16-02-09,44u0fk,Guide to not being an options retard:,"Ok so a quick options guide, because since that high school kid had his run the level of options retardism has ~~gone through the roof~~ remained unchanged. So here is how to not blow up your account.

For Long Options (Just don’t bother shorting options if you're reading this). 
Just follow this guide to maybe not completely waste your money.

**Explanations:**

Note: If a contract has a price of ""$1.35"" you pay $135/contract.

Thing | Description | Guidance
---|---|----
Delta | Delta = 0.4 = For every $1 the underlying increases your options increases $0.4 = $40. Calls have (+) delta (increase in value when underlying goes up), puts have (-) delta (increase in price when underlying goes down) | Delta &amp;lt; 0.3, probably avoid
Theta | Theta = -0.15 = your option contract decreases $0.15 every day = $15 per contract. Theta increases the closer to expiration, so weeklies lose value fast. |
Implied Volatility (IV) | High IV = More Expensive option | Increases leading into earnings, drops after
Volatility Crush | IV Drops significantly after earnings making your options less valuable even if you guessed the direction right |
Bid-Ask Spread | Difference between bid price and ask price of the option | Large spread = bad
Expiry | The contract is exercised after market close on this date. Call = you have the right to buy 100 shares at the call's strike. Put you have the right to sell @ the strike. Exercising usually costs a decent amount of money (~$30). If you're on here you can't afford either of these so don't worry about that.  |


**Strategy Guide**

Strategy | Description  | Should I do it?
---|---|----
""Faggot's Delight"" | Weekly options (&amp;lt;5DTE) + Plan to hold a few nights + Out of the money (Delta &amp;lt;0.3) | no
Earnings Play | Buy weekly Option w/ Delta &gt; 0.45 the night of earnings | ok
Earnings Play | Buying a Weekly ATM straddle (1 Call + 1 Put) | No, you're not the first person to think of this. IV Crush will kill you
It's the middle of the day and SPY is down 1.5%+ | You want to buy a weekly put | No (99% of the time), The market will move against or stagnate and you will either sell at a loss or hold overnight and let theta get you.
Shorting Calls / Puts | - | If you're learning from this guide, no

**Pre Purchase Checklist:** 

If you check 2 or more things on this list, don't do it and save us the impending shitpost.

 | Checklist
---|---
Is it a weekly? (&amp;lt;5 Days to Expiry) |
Are Earnings this Week? |
Does it involve Oil? |
Is Delta &amp;lt;0.3 |
Is Implied Volatility &gt; 200? |
Is it what everyone else on WSB is doing? | 
Is the underlying &amp;lt;$20 |
Does it involve a short call/put? |
Is the bid-ask spread &gt; $0.15/contract |

Edit:

Some people have mentioned using vertical spreads. These are decent defined risk trades. The only issue with these are (without getting into the math) that you will often find that verticals don't become profitable until very close to the expiration date unless there is a huge move int eh underlying.",448
16-02-08,44smus,Advise on a 250k Cash Out Refinance,"I own a condo in LA that has more than doubled in value in the last three years with high potential to increase more in the coming years. It is currently being rented out but only making $300/month is profit. With interest rates so low I am thinking about taking a 250k cash out refinance. (Right now I am locked in at a 4% interest rate for the refinance, this is the same interest rate I have for the current mortgage of the place) 

My thoughts on this are: 
I get to free up equity that would be otherwise doing nothing by keeping the condo. I am siding with keeping the condo to see how high the prices will increase in the next few years and a part of me wants to see if I can keep it just in case I move back to LA (the condo is in a very ideal area). With only a 4% rate, I am going to spread the cash in rentals with a better rate of return (right now I am finding places in my area for 150k that will rent out for 1,500/month) and put some of it in stocks which should potentially average 7.5% in the long haul. 

My current situation: 
This is not my primary residence. I have a stable job (so far, never know) which can carry the cost of the refinance with still more to spare.  I also have a safety net of reserve cash currently in stocks and money market. This would be able to carry any cost if I lose my job or renter of the current place for multiple years (knock on wood, this will never happen) I am willing to risk this money for gain. 

With all this said, is this a good option? Am I missing anything? What would be the best way to extract the most from this investment?",3

This is a very interesting report on the financing arm of the automotive industry. What compelled me to post this report is the concern I've heard multiple times from different sources about the increase in sub-prime lending and increasing risk of default and/or delinquency in the automotive sector, which is their explanation of the low P/E ratios and declining share prices for such stocks as Ford (F), Toyota (T), and General Motors (GM) despite the (seemingly) good news &amp; earnings reports coming out.

Some interesting bits to take away:

* Page 18: As the housing bubble was popping (07-09), the average loan credit scores were reaching their peek, since then, they've declined steadily during the recovery. Credit scores of loans are now approximately what they were in 2007.

* Overall, Financing seems to be more popular as a method of paying for a car (pg. 29). People are willing to pay higher amounts per month than they were previously.

* Buy Here Pay Here (BHPH), where the local dealer themselves makes the loan to the customer, is becoming much less popular.

* Page 31 &amp; 33: Captive Auto Loans (made by the auto manufacturer themselves to the buyer, such as Ford and Toyota) have similar delinquency rates as banks. Financing companies have by far the highest delinquency rates, but the rate has come down significantly from 3Q-2014 to 3Q-2015

* Pages 32 &amp; 34: Maps of the united states with the 30 &amp; 60-day delinquency rates by state. The worst area: the entire Southeast region. The best areas: Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, and the mid-west.

Tesla continues to have high capex burn, has not demonstrated profitability and faces a myriad of problems.

One huge point that longs are missing is that because of Tesla's rapid share price decline, CEO Elon Musk may face several margin calls, which could precipitate even further declines.

With the market in freefall, the Tesla bubble will continue to burst.

She released the song on Saturday and then performed it during the the Super Bowl halftime show on Sunday.

Red Lobster says it trended on Twitter for the first time in history following the song's release. The brand was mentioned on Twitter about 300,000 times over the weekend, including 42,000 times in a single hour, according to the company.

16-02-09,44xbr6,[Q] Is 55yo too late to prep (rebound) for a retirement in 6years?,"... was hoping to retire in six years (deadline dictated by second child needing college support until 2020). 

At present I have approx $430K (dropped from $500K a year ago) in an old (ex-employer) 401K, with Fidelity (which was originally fairly well diversified - and - to give it credit - moved up from a $300K when I departed that org, ~2009, all the way up to $500K in 2015) and another $100K in an active 401K, having also registered a 5% loss since beginning of year (packaged as an offering called ""retirement 2020"", with a mixture of 40% bonds, 45% stocks and 15% inflationary).

Based on all of the above, what options/recommendations would you have, or what material (RTFM ;-)) would you recommend for my reading, that has an appropriate answer to the Q in the $subj?

16-02-09,44uk97,Buying Tesla?,"Hey all! I'm new to investing, but I can't help to notice the major fall of Tesla's stock this past week. Wouldn't it be a good idea to buy some stocks, since the model 3 is going to be unveiled and available to pre-order in march?

And in the long term, it is a company that i believe in. When oil prices (which logically drag Tesla down by being low at the moment) rise back up and they finally start producing cars in a few years, surely it will go up from now, no?

As I said, I'm new to investing, please advise me ;).

16-02-09,44xcpy,Buying only bonds in Roth IRA and balancing with stocks in a taxable account,"I have about $15k in a Roth account and 35k in a taxable account. In my Roth I just have Vanguard target retirement fund 2045. I also have the same fund in my 401k. Since I cannot put more money in Roth (I have already put $5500 for 2016) I was thinking of moving most of the funds from 2045 fund in the IRA to the bonds index it's comprised of, or even better, the admiral equivalents VBTLX and VTABX.

Then in the taxable account I can invest in VTSAX and VTIAX. This way I can have most of my money invested for retirement. The reason being bonds would be better in a tax efficient account. Only thing I can think of is that I'll have to balance in the future since I am not using a target retirement fund. 

Does this make sense to do? What am I overlooking if this is not a good idea? Any tax implications I am missing? I suppose if I decide to move funds from the taxable account to another index, that would create a tax event from selling. Do folks typically do this kind of thing? I.e, have bonds in IRA and stocks in a taxable account so as to put more money towards retirement?

Update: I came to the conclusion of ""bonds would be better in the Roth IRA"" after reading [this](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax-efficient_fund_placement) which categorized total-market bond funds (which I think VBTLX and VTABX are) as moderately tax inefficient. ",2

That's about 15% total. And I haven't really touched it. 

My assumption was that, being an amateur investor with little interest in trading, most trading is done by professionals or robots with far superior information. Therefore, I felt comfortable with the risks inherent in my ETFs and individual stock picks knowing that future risks were already factored into the current price of the stock. Things like the overall economic anxiety, China weakening, gas prices down etc. 

Yet it seems like I would have made a killing if I had bet on those things last month. At the beginning of the year I actually thought about selling a lot of my investments and going ""short,"" but I didn't only because I don't know how.

16-02-09,44y23l,[spec play] Bought some ATVI calls today,"While still at a PE of almost 20 and you know how I feel about high PE stocks right now (but 20 is nothing compared to FANG obviously) and this stock has been absolutely hammered for the last week. Its heading into earnings and I my gut tells me this is due for pop. Its overall direction will still be down like every thing else as it is over valued with respect to the macro environment but in the short term I'm making a bullish play on technicals, earnings and my gut. 

I picked up some May 20 $29 calls as I think stock will get 3%-5% bounce heading into and likely after earnings. I have no idea if they will beat but I think they will give positive forward guidance based on their acquisition of King Digital.. yes they over paid but right now I care more about positive guidance than i do earnings. I'm not expecting a huge bounce and I only picked up 5 calls just to dabble on this spec play and see what its like to take the other side of the trade as I usually only buy puts.

Good luck to anyone that decides to follow. This isn't like my AMZN trade. I make no promises with this one.

Edit: Also something I forgot to note was that it has a very high short interest at the moment and I believe a short squeeze could also send this higher in the near term.",9

I'm guessing that since interest rates were lowered to stimulate economic growth in the midst of the financial meltdown bonds did pretty good. Assuming we are entering another period of economic slow down/recession, or perhaps a significant correction/collapse, Europe and potentially Canada could lower interest rates in the next couple of years. What would this imply for bonds? Several advisors I've spoken to and several articles I've read have nothing good to say about buying bonds right now and I'm not entirely sure why. ",2

Now find out what's next, from the master himself.","Everyone knows I am one of the greatest oracles of the modern day.  How I have not been scooped up by some forward-thinking banking think-tank is a cosmic mystery.  
  
Consider I have given /r/investing such stocks as Netflix, Michael Kors, and 3D Systems before any of their monster runs back in 2012.  
  
Then, since early last year I've been warning that we have reached peak market conditions:  
  
https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2onv3v/and_then_the_tech_bubble_20_crashed/?  
  
https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/34axx6/today_a_coworker_struck_up_a_conversation_about/  
  
This subreddit scoffed and continues to scoff at my legendary prowess, but I don't mind.  In fact, last May I told you all that Bitcoin's return over the next 12 months would more than *double* the best performing Vanguard index fund, and **it certainly has**, soaring from $230 to $370.  
  
https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/34hxdn/the_pegasus_vanguard_vs_bitcoin_challenge_put/?  
  
If that's not enough, I also warned you about the continuing spread of negative interest rates, which are still getting worse by the day:  
  
https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3o3dun/three_month_treasury_yields_are_at_zero_percent/?  
  
-------  
  
So, many of you (including top investment professionals at major firms) are probably wondering: ""Pegasus, *wow*!  What's next?""  
  
Well, I'll tell you again, like I always do.  2016 is going to be a crazy year folks; you better buckle up.  
  
**This market isn't going back up until it goes down a lot more!**  
  
I'm calling for a major crash to really punctuate this recent spiral, and I mean something nasty.  I'm expecting a spring time frame, probably in March (yes, as in next month!)  
  
Oil isn't going anywhere.  Expect capitulation to occur as we finally hit $17 a barrel, and possibly lower.  Only then will we go back up, and even then it will take a while to recover.  Bottom line: people trying to catch the falling knife in oil are gonna get burned.  
  
I expect talk of QE4 to begin after the crash though, and it won't be able to come soon enough!  Without QE4 we may see a bottom of 1100 in the S&amp;P by this time next year.  With Q&amp;E?  Well I can't foresee how much magical pretend money the government will print into the stock market, but the reckoning we will face will be the same.     
   
It's simple math: hard assets are going to be precious luxuries soon.  The paper gold market is in for an upheaval as we collectively discover that paper gold is currently a major sham, but the world isn't going back to precious metals... No, the way forward isn't shiny rocks but decentralized digital networks.  
  
This R3 thing the banks are working on?  Because they have so fundamentally misunderstood what a decentralized blockchain is, it will falter and fail.  The banks will use it, of course, in order to try to justify the millions they will spend making it.  But they will eventually abandon it in favor of a true decentralized alternative.  
  
Speaking of which, for a year now I've been intrigued and 'infiltrating' the world of new *private* digital financial networks.  These use protocol level cryptography for financial privacy.  Along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, Monero and Aeon are likely to become very big deals in coming years (but I am invested in them, and represent them, so don't take my word for it - check out the cutting edge Cryptonote protocol they are based off of).   
  
The stock market isn't going to implode forever, and I expect a new mega bull run to kick off before 2020, but it's not going to start without some pain first.   
  
Money itself is going to experience it's 'uber moment' and we may even begin to see regulated crypto-securities.  If R3 ever finds a real world niche, it could potentially be here, but I still wouldn't bet on it.  
  
Anyhow, I wouldn't be fucking with anyone at the moment, especially not the 50 - 200 P/E companies that boast 'lots of users'.  You thought LinkedIn's mega crash was news?  More are coming.  
  
You'll know when this tech 2.0 bubble has fully crashed back to Earth because we will be considering the long term viability of even juggernauts like Facebook and Amazon.  And here's where you buy back in.  
  
It's easier said than done now, because when the time comes to buy back in we may truly be in the throes of a major economic crisis.  People will scoff at owning Facebook, Google, or Apple stock but that is where you must go.  
  
The big winners in the next bull run?  The sci-fi tech of tomorrow: virtual reality, self-driving cars, digital money, 3D printing, and AI.  
  
Anyway, I've said enough.  I'm happy to see this crash finally get underway because I know that on the other side of every crash lies opportunity - I just would caution against trying to catch this one on the way down.  You may say to ""buy fear"" but I would argue we haven't even seen fear yet - we're just getting started here.  
  
As always, note that this is all my own opinion and I am not an investment professional.  I am not licensed to give financial advice to anyone, and have no current market positions, long or short.  I only own 100% cryptocurrency at the moment, which I plan to hold for the foreseeable future, and partially diversify from once this market is much lower.  
  
Feel free to disagree with me and be on the wrong side of history yet again.

16-02-09,44yxoo,LinkedIn’s crash has many traders on high alert,"The crash in LinkedIn Corp's shares last week has many traders in the options market braced for an unusually violent reaction from Twitter Inc and Pandora Media Inc's shares after the companies report results this week.

LinkedIn shares dropped 44 percent on Friday, wiping out nearly $11 billion of market value, as investors balked at a disappointing revenue forecast.
""The release of LinkedIn earnings on Friday raised concerns about several social media companies,"" said Scott Fullman, chief strategist at Revere Securities LLC. Fullman cited the correlation between these stocks, which has increased since November, as one reason why LinkedIn's woes may have Twitter and Pandora investors worried.

16-02-09,44z19x,Should I move my Hargreaves Lansdown S+S ISA?,"Hi guys, 

I've had a HL S+S ISA since I was 18 (6 years) but only started investing about 3 years ago, starting off with a £1000 lump sum with an 80:20 split between Vanguard Lifestrategy 100/80. I've been drip feeding from £25-100 a month into each fund since, and chose the option to reinvest all dividends. With more disposable income, I'm planning to increase the amount I invest each month.

But as my portfolio has risen to over £10000, I believe HL's 0.45% annual fee is not capped for funds, which means I'll be paying &gt;£45 per year as well as £24 for Vanguard's fees, more than I had expected. 

Would it be worth paying the £50 stock transfer fee and £30 leaving fee now to move to another platform such as Cavendish who charge 0.25% annually or Halifax who have a £12.50 flat fee? Are there any benefits to staying with HL as my portfolio potentially grows to  50, 100k, 250k+?

Janet Yellen
Jonathan Ernst | Reuters
Janet Yellen
Tightening financial conditions driven by falling stock prices, uncertainty over China and a global reassessment of credit risk could throw the U.S. economy off track from an otherwise solid course, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said on Wednesday in prepared testimony to Congress.

In testimony that combined a steady-as-she-goes account of Fed policy with an acknowledgement of intensifying risks, Yellen said there are good reasons to believe the United States will stay on a path of moderate growth that will allow the Fed to pursue ""gradual"" adjustments to monetary policy.

Family incomes and wealth are rising, domestic spending ""has continued to advance,"" and business investment outside the oil sector accelerated in the second half of the year, she said. Yellen said she expects the labor market to continue to improve and inflation eventually rise toward the Fed's target despite a recent drop in inflation expectations cited by some policymakers as particularly unnerving.

But Yellen acknowledged that some of the weaknesses in the global economy have become self re-enforcing, with weak growth in major manufacturers like China and oversupply on commodity markets rattling the world's oil and mineral exporters. A broad sense of a world slowdown, in turn, and uncertainty about the depth of China's problems, has tightened financial conditions for U.S. businesses.
The Fed ""expects that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in coming years and that labor market indicators will continue to strengthen,"" Yellen said.

DIS in the mid 70s is a buy as is TWX in the mid 40s. 

There's obvious down-ward pressure on everything these days and I see no reason that's going to end anytime soon. I plan to start small positions once(not if) those reach that price range and buy more if they continue falling past that. ",3

16-02-10,451kqn,Why do ETFs trade at a discount?,"Better title: Why does *this* ETF trade at a discount?

I was looking at [VCV](http://www.morningstar.com/cefs/xnys/vcv/quote.html) which is trading at a ~7% discount for the last 3 years and ~4% currently.  

Initially I thought that it was because it's a long duration bond fund (WAM is 18.3 years) and everyone is bailing out of the fund but other funds with similar duration aren't trading at such a high discount.

Is it due to the fund is leveraged (Morningstar claims 35%) and the cost of borrowing will increase in the future, resulting in a double whammy?  FWIW, the fund has 179m (or 17% of total assets) in variable rate debt (@ ~1.6% if I'm calculating it right).

Or is it simply that it's a tiny ETF (~600m in assets) and no one gives a fuck about it?",2

16-02-10,45336n,"Oil - Why I believe this is the bottom, and if it doesn't bottom out within a day or two, then it will be $22 in a month on the dot and that's it. That's right, I'm calling it!","I made a post on another sub yesterday, but I'm copying it here for all of you guys. I'm an oil trader and I love doing serious oil analysis and would love to share my opinions with you guys over at /r/investing. Standard disclaimer stuff of course (invest at your own risk, not a broker, yada yada!)

To clarify what I consider a bottom is where the fall stops. Usually a fall happens in stages, then there's a little profit taking, and then either flat, reverse, or more falling from there. A bottom is *not* calling for bullish oil, this requires news of fundamental changes in the current environment. At these bottoms is where I'm covering my short and looking to trade the pop up long, then finding the right spot to get back in short. All those posts I have in another sub, but since self promotion is against the rules so I'm going to leave off the links. 

[This is the path to the bottom](http://i.imgur.com/yLlsfbD.png) to start my short near the $34.00's. Look at an hourly chart now and check out the consolidation at  the prices I showed a week in advance: 30.27, 29.40, 27.56. And even called out a ""likely a hiccup day"" on the Tuesday which all seemed to play out as anticipated. I use a mathematical model based on the a modified Cauchy equation (similar to Navier-Stokes) to predict the ebb and flow of price momentum decay and energy loss, the same way you can show water flowing through a bending pipe. And I have it all wrapped up into an algo that points out these targets. It's been spot on almost to the day and price as the chart shows.

Well I just cashed out yesterday. Now I'm using similar methods to attempt a long trade on the short term. If that fails I'm back to shorting and trying a new long near $22. [Bull and Bear case here](http://i.imgur.com/bLn7s7k.png)

Disclaimer number two: Now the way that TA works, is that in light of no major news these things hold. If some crazy news event or major liquidity event happens, you scrap the chart and make a new one based off the new sentiment. But you might go weeks without news from the Saudis or OPEC, so TA guides you in between these major events. 

Oil has fundamentals averaging it in around $32 right now and over the last week I've started to see the OVX lead the VIX, and accordingly the SPX lead WTI prices. Despite what CNBC or other talking heads are saying, oil to me is not dragging the markets down--the markets are instead dragging oil down.

The oversupply is practically the same via the IEA report, and world demand is set to grow over 2016 (bullish), although the rate of growth has been projected to decline from 1.6 to 1.2 mmbpd (bearish). In addition to this, the S&amp;P has downgraded the credit ratings of close to like 50 E&amp;P's today. Bearish outlook for them, but that also is based on the well valuations of oil at this price.

The latter bearish flags today has shot oil downward in the short term toward the 52-wk low, coupled with what is now the looming crisis: banking, credit and monetary policy (just like it was leading into the 2008 crash) things look very bad. According to the chart, $22 oil bad at minimum if the markets were to crash. That is the bear case. So my eyes will be on banking, especially with Japan over the next few days. If I am looking for longs now, and stop out, I'll be short for the ride down instead.

However... there is a silver lining. Things always look the absolute worst before the end of a trend or even a reversal. The sky is not just gray, it's dark black and raining fire and brimstone. With the SPX leading WTI prices in the ticks intraday, what I believe oil is now is a proxy bet on the overall state of the economy more so than a fundamental trade on supply and demand in this oversold short term. Which makes sense because by proxy people are betting on economical health leading to higher demands. 

So in light of the obvious bearish case, there is a chance for a correction. Firstly: the March contract is quickly expiring, and CL is trading to test the previous 52-wk low. It is the path of least resistance. However think of this... if it fails to fall significantly lower than that, and the SPX rallies and there is no market crash / bear market scenario, commerical producers who usually hold a net short position will need to actually be locking in low prices for actual delivery oil (a lot of these mini rallies we see on the way down this last year can be explained by this sort of activity). It leads to a classic W-shaped reversal and buying spree near or slightly after the expiration of the contract. With looming contango in prices and the economy starting to teeter on total collapse, producers are going to need to be pinching every penny they can get, so if there is just the slightest hint of covering, it will cover hard...

OVX at 74 and a bollinger band squeeze on the dailies, volatility is the new name of the game and any moves to the up or downside from here will be swift. ESPECIALLY to the upside!

Which of course we'd overshoot to the point oil fundamentals will take over to bring oil back down toward the $32 level until bullish news on the supply/demand side leaks...but that's next quarter's short trade, so we'll worry about that then :)

Until SPX fails 1830's, I'm looking for dips and pecking at the long bet personally. Have my stops set of course, so I'll lose little attempting and only miss out on short profits. But a lack of a loss is still a gain in my book and worth a shot-- that juicy OVX 74 and climbing--I wouldn't want to miss half of a 20-40% move in oil after all!
Best of luck everyone!

16-02-10,451zzs,Did the feds just pave a legal path for self-driving cars?,"While the letter is nether a formal policy ruling nor a recommendation, its tone suggests the agency is open to considering whether an artificial-intelligence system can be legally considered a driver.


In the letter, the NHTSA said that as “foundational starting point,” it “will interpret ‘driver’ in the context of Google’s described motor vehicle design as referring to the (self-driving system), and not to any of the vehicle occupants.”

“We agree with Google its (self-driving car) will not have a ‘driver’ in the traditional sense that vehicles have had drivers during the last more than one hundred years,” the NHTSA said. “If no human occupant of the vehicle can actually drive the vehicle, it is more reasonable to identify the driver as whatever (as opposed to whoever) is doing the driving.”

That possible interpretation of “driver” could have major implications in California, where Google has been testing autonomous cars for years, and which in December released draft rules that call for driverless cars, to, ironically enough, have a licensed driver. Those proposals caused dismay among driverless-car proponents; on Tuesday, a number of tech industry groups called on the state to rethink the driver requirement, saying it “misses the point” of the technology.

The NHTSA letter asks Google to answer a number of questions certifying the safety of its systems, and while numerous legal hurdles remain, the door to autonomous driving may have been pushed open.

16-02-10,453mru,My Gilead panic attack and discussion on uncertainty,"So I like GILD. It's raking in the dough and even if Merck has a cheaper/better product, I'd say Harvoni/Sovaldi have such a strong base and have been in the market long enough that doctors will be fairly reluctant to switch. I've bought every time it dipped below $100 last year and again last month at $95. Today I woke up, had a mild panic attack after realizing it is now 15% of my portfolio being little more than paperweight (that’s a lot for me). 

I used to believe that a good acquisition could be the catalyst that pushes Gilead up but now I’m starting to think that the valuation has been stagnant for such a long period of time that even an amazing acquisition won’t be enough. Everyone knows Gilead needs to diversify its pipeline and the targets Gilead hopes to acquire can play this to its advantage. Even if Gilead acquires a company that can diversify its pipeline incredibly, it will have to pay such a big premium for it that it will no longer provide the boost GILD needs until a couple quarters after closing after everything is over. The immediate boost that everyone (or at least that I) was hoping for will not happen and it will be more like the usual acquisitions where the buyer loses value and the seller gains.

After typing this I’m unsure what message I’m trying to convey. Maybe its wait until after an acquisition announcement to start a position/accumulate GILD. Or maybe I just need a place to vent to calm my nerves. Either way thanks for listening.

Closing questions: 

What do you guys think about the whole situation? 

Who do you guys think Gilead will buy and why? - Personally I’m hoping for $INCY or $CLVS for cancer but as a fan of diversification I wouldn’t mind them trying to branch out into the medical instruments/supplies like $BVX, $LAKE, or $MMSI though I haven’t done anywhere near enough research to know if those would even be viable targets.",3

It's been happening for a while, but at 25 bps it wasn't that much money and not many people noticed. Now that they have started to raise short term interest rates, by offering a higher rate on excess reserves... the amount they pay could start getting up into the tens of billions. I joked with a coworker a couple months ago about how politicians will love this, and sure enough in Yellen's testimony today we saw those pesky politicians start to grill her for it.

16-02-10,454ki9,Investing in stressed energy/oil companies for heightened dividend yields?,"Real quick thought I had today...

Obviously oil/ energy sector is getting killed lately. A handful of companies I follow are down 50, 60, 70% off their 1 year prices. Most of these companies traditionally paid a dividend that worked out to a little less than 2% annualized.

Well, since some of these companies are getting crushed, as long as they don't change their dividend, the yield becomes inversely proportionate to the price of stock. In some cases, I've got companies on my radar that have paid the same dividend for a decade, and I know it's a huge sign of weakness, but not unlikely.

One example: $TDW ... Dividend payout quarterly is $0.25. Currently trading under $5/ share. That means a quarterly distribution of about 5%, or 20% annualized. Obviously not sustainable for them, but even if they halved their dividend, we're still talking about 10% annualized. Seeing as I fully expect 2016 to crush my portfolio, this seems like an opportunity to get a moderate return for the risk of hoping this firm doesn't go under.

16-02-10,453umc,Why I like NVDA: the deep-learning cloud,"Went long NVDA at $26.  I don't particularly care about the 3D graphics market, one-chip-per-XBox doesn't get me excited.

What gets me excited is something that was figured out about 10 years ago: deep-learning neural net algorithms run about 100 to 200x faster on a graphics chip than on a regular CPU.  That's because, like 3D graphics rendering, neural nets are massively parallel computational tasks, so a high-end Intel Xeon chip with 16 complex cores has absolutely nothing on an equally priced NVDA GPU, with hundreds or thousands of simpler cores on the same amount of silicon.  It's not just 2 or 3x faster, it's 1-200x faster.

Every major tech company is pumping money into deep-learning servers running neural net software optimized to run on GPU farms.  Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, IBM, Apple, Alibaba, all are enabling deep learning ""smart"" services.

The commercial applications are huge, just consider what a deep-learning A.I. could do to relieve costs and complexity for companies with high-touch customer service.  No wait times, no frustrating phone menus, no slow-to-respond human chats.  A fast, human-like A.I..

I think NVDA is dominant enough in this space that it will continue to attract the top A.I. scientists, like Andrew Ng.  It's R&amp;D and manufacturing lead is probably insurmountable at this point, and no other company is squarely focused on GPU's (they should just put AMD out of its misery at this point by buying it).  If deep-learning services truly represent a new technology tipping point, I think we may see a world where Intel and Nvidia reverse positions, and servers will only need a single, low cost CPU to administer the real gems -- a bank of high end GPUs running neural nets.  At the moment, Intel is about 10x the size of Nvidia.",15

At first I was thinking theres no way this could be real, and I was very sceptical, but after doing a lot of research on them, speaking time and time again with their upper management, opening an account AND trading with several others who are using them, I've come to the conclusion that this is a great option for people looking to get away from greedy broker fees and actually KEEP more of your trading profits.
The way it works is if you add liquidity to the market in a trade, its FREE (they use EDGE X route to get a credit, but its free for your trade). If you remove liquidity, it costs 0.005/share.. For example, if I bid for 2000 shares of stock ABCD at $2 and get filled on the bid, and then offer the 2000 shares at $2.10 and get filled later, that trade is FREE and a $200 profit is made. Now lets say that instead of offering at $2.10 (adding liquidity), you remove the bid at $2.10 it would cost you $10 for the removing 2k shares and your profit would be $190 net.
This is VERY competitive when comparing to similar brokers, and so far they have been great as far as customer service and their commission structure is working exactly as promised.
Unfortunately, they do not service US clients, but anywhere else in the world you can use them. Im open for discussion if you have any questions about this broker, I can probably answer it for you, or direct you to the company director who can.",3

For example, in a hedge fund quarterly letter I recently read, they mentioned they had X% long exposure and Y% short exposure.

I'm going to run through an example, please let me know if my understanding is correct.

Let's say I start a hedge fund with $100M raised from initial investors.

(1) I decide to invest $50M long in companies I think are undervalued and then short $50M worth of stock in companies I think are overvalued.

Therefore, my gross exposure = 100% (50% long + 50% short) and my net exposure = 0% (50% long - 50% short), correct?

(2) Now same $100M initial portfolio, except say $100M in long positions and $50M in short positions. How would you calculate gross and net exposure for this example? Is gross exposure 150% since total assets will be $150M/100M? And net exposure is 100/150 - 50/150 = 33%?

(3) Same $100M initial portfolio, except $50M in long positions, $30M in short positions, and remaining $20M in cash. How to calculate gross and net exposure? Is it 80% gross exposure (50% long + 30% short) and net exposure of 20% (50% long - 30% short)?

Am I calculating this correctly?

16-02-10,454vpf,The Case for Buying BAC - Stock Analysis,"Hey r/Investing! I've been following BAC (Bank of America) for the past month or two trying to determine if it's worthy of going long in for at least a few years. After doing some reading and some personal analysis I've come to the conclusion that it is.

**NOTE: This isn't a post specifically telling you to buy BAC, but rather an exercise for myself in making well thought-out investment decisions.**

Continuing on, let's first look at the risk currently associated with buying banking stock:

 **1. BAC's exposure to oil.**  With the oil glut investors are scared about investing in bank stocks in general because they are worried about the associated risk of that bank having to deal with defaults on loans given to oil and natural gas ventures. If we take a look at BAC's loans (and the wider banking industry in general), this kind of debt only makes up roughly 3% of their loan portfolio, meaning exposure to this kind of risk is fairly minimal.

**2. BAC is a well capitalized bank.** This is an important factor when I consider both BAC's resistance to toxic debt and it's ability to continue capital disbursements^1. If we take a look at BAC's capital ratios we find that it beats every regulation placed upon it by at least a percentage point. To be defined as a well-capitalized bank it must have an asset-to-capital ratio of 10% of Tier 1 Common Capital (defined as common equity, retained earnings, goodwill, etc). It has 11.6%. Article 1 explains this concept further. This means that it can continue capital distributions (dividends, bonus pays, etc) and is not subject to additional restrictions by banking regulators.

**Aside:** While considering point number two under risk analysis we must consider the fact that having high capital-to-asset ratios also means that BAC has to operate with essentially less leverage which potentially harms it's long term earnings prospect.

Now let's talk about how BAC stock is currently deeply discounted compared to it's potential growth, keeping in mind that we are talking about a 2-3 year hold horizon at the minimum, current shares are trading at around 54% book value. Couple this with a P/E of 9.20 (roughly 1 less than the industry standard) and a PEG ratio .86 indicates that, fundamentally, BAC is a value buy^2.

Now we know that value traps are a thing to look out for. It's not enough for a stock to look under priced. It has to have a real, tangible, convincing probability of growth in the future that doesn't justify this low price. I think this probability exists when we consider that the economy is at full employment and real wages are finally start to see an increase (even if it's modest). BAC's primary earnings come from a strong domestic presence which means is stands to gain from improvements in the aforementioned metrics. Not only does high employment (currently pegged at around 4.6%) and higher wages mean more saving, but it also means more spending. In an economy such as this, people can justify car and home loans that they couldn't a mere five years ago. Furthermore, despite international turmoil, the Fed has indicated it's continuing it's plan to raise rates. This stands to improve BACs earnings even further.

All in all, this analysis, to me, justifies taking a long position in BAC. I myself am considering picking up 100 shares this week. (I have very little capital to work with currently, so I'd grab more if I could)

What are your thoughts? Are there things I have overlooked?

I read on a few threads here about XOP? I'm thinking about investing in one of those to get some good exposure/price sensitivity to crude oil (both up or down) that doesn't have all the decay/contango/roll yield issues that the futures-based ones have.

16-02-10,455b97,"Tread lightly. It's brutal out there.","I'm often the voice of caution around here and when I am I get a lot of dickhead comments, and that's totally fine because I love the humor of this sub.  But because not everyone plays in every stock, everyone needs to be aware of what's going on in the market right now that is going to make it difficult to be a winner even if your style of trading is outright directional YOLO.  When volatility is this high and there are so many macro questions without answers we end up with myriad results that make little sense.  If we happen to win or lose we can prented in hindsight to say ""oh that makes sense because ______"" but taken as a whole they really don't.  Recent examples:

1. LNKD drops 50% on best quarter ever but weak guidance - not 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% - half of its value gone
2. TSLA up 12% AH right now when most people were looking for further downside
3. TWTR traded way down on earnings AH today and then almost completely recovered.  If TWTR stays anywhere near its pre-earnings price options players are going to mostly get brutalized.  No one assumes a no move on Twitter earnings
4.  NFLX traded below $80. That's below the mini-flash crash we had a while back.
5. AMZN has lost 35% of its value from peak.  

To be clear, it's not about a market downturn being surprising, its about trades around earnings plays being screwy, I can't even list them all here.  Institutions are shifting capital allocations, everyone is running blind as to macro factors, etc.

So yes, you can certainly make money here and you may guess right in spite of all of this but just exercise some judgment.  Take a slightly smaller position maybe, there will always be another earnings release to profit on.

Seriously - TWTR is unmoved on earnings.  It's the Wild West out there",6

16-02-10,4549ua,"SPX - Not going to crash like 2007, but a 2-3 year bear market like 1999","Made [this graph](http://i.imgur.com/M2gBV4r.png) for our folks over at DTP last week. The SPX is playing out very closely to this and I happened to pick up some SPXL at the bottom so I'm sitting pretty in my trade so far. 

This in my opinion is not a case where the market flat out crashes. There are very technical supports that are holding strong, and resistances that the SPX is trading up to. 

Right now we have a very high probability of a 1985 to 2012 retrace in the SPX before any additional falling, and that is the normal cycling you would expect from a developing bear market. 

The Fed's moves, the low bond yields, and Yellen's general dovish stance on fiscal policy is going to be a weak trade for market bears in my opinion in the short term. Things will fall, but they need to rise first. So far this chart has held up for the last four days almost exactly.

16-02-11,459u1m,Gold Explodes Higher on Sweden Negative Rate Move,"*See us on the Fox Business channel today to discuss the currents markets today during the 5pm (ET) ""Risk and Reward"" show with Dierdre Bolton.*

**Equities:** The MAR16 SP500 is down 20 points to 1827.50, after spiking lower to 1802.50. The 2 major news points in the past 24 hours seem to be Janet Yellen’s testimony and Q&amp;A yesterday in front of Congress not inspiring confidence in the markets as well as the Swedish Central Bank bringing their rates further into negative territory. 1800 still seems to be a key support level, but 1760 looks like a more important support level. Technically, the market clearly seems to be downtrending.

**Bonds:** The MAR16 US bonds exploded higher overnight, hitting an intraday high of 170’26. Currently, the bonds are down 2 points from the high at 168’26. As we have been noting, it looks like we could be in a type of bond bubble.

**FX:** The MAR16 USD is down .3% today to 95.65. One would think if other central banks are lowering rates, the USD should rally. That is not actually happening though. This may be because the market may be starting to price in the Fed going into negative rate territory. The MAR16 Euro continues its rally above the 200 day moving average.

**Commodities:** MAR16 WTI is down another 2.7% to $26.70. There is seemingly no end in sight for this oil bear market. All major support levels over the past several months have been easily breached. The real big story of today’s commodity markets is gold. Gold continues its blistering rally, up $48 today to $1242. The negative interest rate policies of various central banks is really stoking demand for gold. $1220, once a key resistance level, may now be a key support level.

16-02-11,459wsd,[Serious] What does everyone think of the China panic?,"More specifically, how it will affect US markets?

Some people seem to think that the US market is in for a mediocre recession and China's market will correct without any major resetting, some people think it's only a fear driven rationale and the US markets will recover in a few months, and others seem to think we're in for a global recession unlike any we've seen before.

I'm torn, I do believe that fear is mostly driving the market. But then I read Kyle Bass' letter to his investors. (http://www.valuewalk.com/2016/02/kyle-bass-china/)

He's been right on some things like the 2008 crisis and wrong on calling other markets, but what I took from this letter was the graph of China's banking assets vs. GDP. China's banks have gone from $3T in assets to $30T+ in assets since 2004 while GDP is beginning to slump at 5T and still declining in growth. That seems terrifying to me that bank assets are skyrocketing at a 45 degree angle while GDP growth continues to decline.

16-02-11,459wto,"Great indicator/strategy: RSI and William's %R + SMAs","I'm very interested in technical analysis and researching better indicators. Yesterday, an experienced trader recommended William's %R so I did some research. This research led me to a youtube video of a trader explaining how she uses W%R in combination with RSI and SMMAs. [Here is that video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI95IPGvc7g)

Today, I used this technique today to find my clear entry and exit points on NUGT, which I know was going up based on the price of gold last night. I was able to make up for my losses the last week and a half.



**The Strategy:**

1. Buy when the 3-day SMA crosses above the 8-day SMA and the W%R is close to the RSI. The SMA crossing is the most important indicator here.

2. Hold as long as the 3-day SMA is above the 8-day SMA and watch for the RSI to rise up and touch the William's %R. Again, the SMAs are the most important indicator here. This will help you filter out false signals.

3. Sell when the 3-day SMA crosses the 9-day SMA. The W%R and RSI will give you a huge heads up for when this will happen by meeting above the RSI's normal range.

[Here is an example from today](http://i.imgur.com/djzyX99.png). I was in at 50 (bought too early at opening but averaged down &gt;.&lt;) and set a stop loss at 53.50 based on trendlines.


**DISCLAIMER:** Like all indicators, this does not always work. Use at your own risk. Draw trend lines and MAKE SURE TO USE A STOPLOSS!",7

16-02-11,459yoq,"[Discussion] Started with $11000 in 2012, went up to $145000 in 2014 and now it is $77000","I started investing in the summer 2012. Opened an account, put $11000 in it, and bought 5500 NOK for 1.92 and a month later I sold it for $4.00.  Bought back 16000 shares at 2.70 (with margin!) and a few months later I sold them for 4.20. Did a few other trades (on margin!!) with SNE, SFTBY and other stocks.

By September of 2014 I had a net liquidation value  $145000 and then it hit me. Holy shit, I made so much money! Too keep things in perspective. I live in a country where the average annual wage is $13.000 and $150.000 can buy you a decent 1300 ft2 apartment in a good neighborhood in a big city.

I considered selling it all and buying a house and even went looking at house. But I realized I could make more money doing what I do than I could make with a house. I assumed that I was very smart, but in reality I was a bit sharp, but mostly lucky with my risks. 

After that, I traded less and held on to the stocks I had as a long term investment. Ever since my portfolio value has been shrinking. A month ago it was still $115.000, but the market has gone down. One of the biggest parts of my portfolio is the stock it all started with, NOK! But NOK has been down much harder than the market. I was trading at $7.46 a month ago and $5.84 now.

Right now my balance is

* Net Liquidation Value = $77000

* Securities Gross Position Value = $146000

* Cash = $-69000

[Based on this this chart]( https://i.imgur.com/iMjfGf7.jpg) I am not sure if I am in the Fear, Capitulation or Despair fase.

The way I see it, the options are:

1. Sell it all and be happy with $77000. Going from $11000 to $77000 in less than 4 years is still a great return.

2. Do nothing and wait it out.

3. Sell $70000 worth of stock so I don’t have negative. Currently my leverage is 1.9 and I can go to 2.25 before I get a margin call. 

4. Other options?

16-02-11,458myg,A Bird in the Hand or Two in the Bush?,"I wrote a lengthy email to a friend, and I thought I would share it with reddit since it took so long to write. Please feel free to comment regarding any errors or disagreements. The initial purpose of this was to communicate my general concerns to her. The content reflects my opinions and should not be considered investment advice.

The basic concept is elementary. Are you familiar with the saying, ""A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush?"" Let's change the saying to ""A dollar in the hand is worth two tomorrow.""

Put it this way, if you had $1 today, how much would I have to pay you next year for you to lend me that $1? The price you name will (or at least SHOULD) include two variables. The interest you require should include compensation for waiting and for risk.

Let's say you were willing to charge me 2% for waiting (roughly the 10 year treasury yield) and 8% for risk (considered risk premium relative to treasury yield). So the following year I would pay you $1.10.

Let's go back to the analogy of the birds.

If you had a bird in your hand, and I had two birds in a bush in my back yard, would you give me your one bird for a chance to catch the two birds on my property?

This isn't a trick question. The answer requires an evaluation of risk, just like before.

The saying, ""A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush,"" assumes risk of roughly 50%. If you were an average bird hunter, and consistently captured 50% of the birds you attempted to catch, then any quantity in the bush is worth 50%. Therefor 50% of 2 = 1. Isn't that an exciting concept?! Haha hang in there. This is an important concept, and it might be priceless for you in the future.

Now let's say you were Tarzan, and you had a success rate of 80% when trying to capture any bird. The two birds in the bush would be worth roughly 80% of their value. Roughly 1.6 birds. Now, the birds in the bush are worth more than the single bird in your hand. In this case it would be wise for you to give me your one bird, so you could capture more than what you gave me.

The inverse is true. If you are a terrible bird catcher with a 20% (80% risk) success rate, the two birds in the bush are worth .4 birds (20% of 2). Now the bird in the hand is worth more than twice the birds in the bush.

The basic idea is that risk changes the value of the birds in the bush. Low risk favors the bush, and high risk favors the hand. A low risk economy favors future earnings and growth, and a high risk economy favors cash in the hand.

The problem with calculating risk is that we can be wrong or it can change once we have made our calculation. If you thought you were an awesome bird catcher, but you weren't, you might surrender your one bird and receive less than 1 back. Or let's say you surrender your one bird and trip on something and break your leg before you can catch the birds. Now risk has changed and your birds in the bush are worth 0.

Going back to the market. If investing in the economy becomes more risky after you've already invested your $1 in the hand, then the value of $2 next year goes down (This means that stock prices go down. Remember, buying stocks is buying the future earnings of those companies). If investing in the market becomes very risky, cash today becomes more valuable.

Interest rates and corporate bond yields reflect risk. That's why it's called ""risk premium."" So if corporate bonds or junk bonds or the bond market as a whole demand a higher risk premium due to high losses or uncertainty, the current price of stocks should go down.

Warren Buffett says that high interest rates makes stocks worthless. “If interest rates were 10 percent, all of our stocks would be worthless. Everything is a function of interest rates. Interest rates are like gravity.” Here's a link to the article if you're interested in that. http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20141007-warren-buffett-says-high-interest-rates-make-stocks-worthless.ece

It's important to make a distinction between waiting and risk. The US treasury sells 10 year securities, commonly called 10 year treasuries, and this is considered 0% risk. If an investment requires 0% risk, then the interest paid is considered payment for waiting. Now it's important to also subtract the 10 year treasury yield from any loan or corporate bond when calculating the risk premium. Remember, the risk premium is what you get paid for taking risk. The 10 year treasury yield is what you get paid for waiting just like in the example I gave earlier when I borrowed $1. So if your neighbor Joe borrows money at 10%, you subtract the 10 year treasury yield since it's the only risk free instrument.

The Federal Reserve has tried to suppress all bond yields (corporate, government, and other loans or bonds) artificially to promote investing in the economy. The problem with this is that risk has not really changed. Remember, interest rates should reflect two variables, time and risk. The Federal Reserve can't decrease risk to lower interest rates. But it can control treasury yields (through quantitative easing [QE] and .5% fed funds rate), the price for waiting.

If you wanted to invest with a goal of 10% a year for retirement or other purposes, different market conditions offer different options. If the price of waiting offered to you was high, let's say 8%, you would only need to adopt risk premium of 2% to achieve your goal. If the price of waiting was low, let's say 2%, you would need to adopt a risk premium of 8%. So, in effect, changing the price of time changes the risk implied by your goals. That's why stocks have done so well and lower risk bonds have yielded much lower than previous years.

So the market environment today is hungry for yield. This has pushed investors and companies to take on more risk. And I think that this risk is being underestimated. Remember, if risk is miscalculated, you can pay 1 bird and get less than one bird back.

We'll see how everything unfolds. Take care for now.",10

16-02-11,458ow5,[COMMENTARY][CITI IB] 50 Shades of Ugly,"Thursday, February 11, 2016 7:45 AM

Sorry to depress and I know no one wants to read about ugly, but we’ve got it in full force risk-off right now.  UST 10-year yield falls to 1.56%, S&amp;P futures are down 33, Xover +30, Main +7.

While credit is wider, the shock of new levels and shrinking liquidity has actually held back some trading and there was less changing hands overnight than one might think. UK traders say cash is outperforming the indices because accounts didn’t seem ready for the repricing, although a new wave of selling has just hit and bottom fishers are just starting to surface.

Even our Asia desk reported a move to the sidelines as soon as the widening began.

The European periphery weighs as sovereign Portuguese 10’s moved to more than 435bp over Germany  (+90bp wider). Portugal was 130bp over Germany less than a year ago.  Anything Portuguese in the credit space is something like 40-60bp wider.

The Hang Seng was the one Asian stock market opened last night and it fell nearly 4%.   Oil is down 4% to under $27.  Currency markets very volatile, USDJPY moved quickly from 111 to 113, with no explanation.

“Bids are way back, freefall,” adds the UK HY desk. High yield is down 1-2 points, miners are down 1 1/2 points, you get the picture.

“It really feels like we’re in the eye of the storm where everything is eerily quiet,” adds a UK trader.
NY just getting underway. The Yankee subs are quoted +25-40bp. TMT starts +4-8. It’s deadly quiet in here.
IG25 reaches 126 again, +5bp; HY25 is down 3/4 to 96.

Let's say I bought **one** stock of a company in 2005 for the price of $10. The value of the trade is $10.

In 2015, lets say the stock cost $100. The value of the position is $100.

Now that it is 2016, let's say hypothetically, the stock is trading for $105. The value of the position is now $105.

From 2015 to 2016, the stock increased by $5. We gained 5%, right? The price went from 100 to 105. **However, our initial investment was $10**. A $5 gain in 2016, compared to our initial investment, is a 50% increase in value compared to 2005.

Is there a flaw in my thinking? Does keeping an investment in the market for more and more time ""Magnify"" how much the value of the investment changes each day?

The reason I am having this thought is because if you bought stock when it cost $10 in 2005, and now in 2016 we can expect the price to increase from $105 to $110, to $100 all in the space of a few days (5% gain or lose in a week), that would have a HUGE impact on what value you capture if you decide to trade at $104 compared to $106, compared to $110.

16-02-12,45d49i,Returning value to shareholders via dividends vs. stock buybacks,"I was discussing with a friend about returning value to shareholders via dividends vs. stock buybacks. At first glance, it seems that either one would deliver value, but buybacks seem to be a strange and circuitous way of doing so. In the short-term, I can see how the buyback would increase share price enriching all shareholders, but is this a sustainable increase or is there some reversion-to-the-mean here? It seems that rational investors would sell then if the market price went above what was fundamentally justified (whatever that means to them), giving some boon to the most bearish of current market makers (those with the lowest ask price), eliminating some of the most bearish estimates of market value, which then biases the remaining tug-of-war market forces towards a higher price, thereby delivering some value (using the term loosely) to remaining shareholders.

But it's not as if the company is any better or worse off *because* of the decision to do the buyback, so it seems that whatever fundamental value the company has doesn't change, even if the market price does. So this seems distortionary on some level. Dividends seem much easier for me to wrap my head around and seem to have a predictable and uniform effect. Are there other advantages and disadvantages for either? How does one compare the intrinsic value of two companies that are alike in every way except that one company returns value via dividends and the other through buybacks? Are there tax incentives for a company to do one over the other? Why have companies shied away from dividends in recent years? Have there been instances of front-running during a buyback?

So its pretty funny that the Fed Bought all those zero value MBS and weird stuff at top dollar, rated AAA of course, then kept the payment on its own books and did not allow the Banks to withdraw that money, but paid an interest greater than its fund rate, and the banks got to declare that as reserves and pocket the interest, all going towards their so called Capital Adequacy Ratio . . .oh Yeah . .told you so :D

Pretty cool.

But I will bet the Fed has over leveraged that and wound it up a bit so that $2.3 trillion is appearing multiple times on various banks books and if you were to total the declared reserves of all the banks at the Fed, it would add up to  whole lot more than what the Fed is good for. ;D

Which is ok, so long as a single bank goes pop, but when another sector wide shock crystallizes, like oil or some goobly gook loans, thats when that leverage becomes a pretty big problem.

And now that a catalyst is in play, the FED testimony will soon look like this

(http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-02-11/jpm-ficc-head-people-have-more-confidence-gold-bank-deposits-or-paper-money)  
  
The world is waking up to the realization that nothing is sacred and all money is a set of convenient rules we have agreed on to transact with each other.  You could call it 'imaginary' but that wouldn't be totally accurate: it is the group belief in an asset that gives it power and authority.  
  
Until now we have relied on megabanks to set monetary policy for the world but there are signs that a titanic meltdown may be happening within that furnace.  Signs if this are everywhere, including conspiring to force the world to move to an all-digital financial ecosystem so dramatic negative rates can be imposed: http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-02-10/something-very-disturbing-spotted-morgan-stanley-presentation-slide.  I won't engage in any 'told you so' here; I simply want to urge you to get involved in cryptocurrency, even as a mental excursion.  
  
The IMF certainly is, and it is very likely that by the 2020s global finance will run on top of a combination of these new fangled 'blockchains'.  
  
You have many reputable projects to choose from, and a few other fringe ones if you want to get your feet wet with experimental cryptography.  
  
**Bitcoin**: the original implementation of decentralized digital money.  It is the largest and most well known Blockchain in the world.  It's use of a public ledger and necessary transition to a deflationary and fee-based economy has caused criticism, but there is likely a bright future ahead of it (cue the trolls badgering me about sidechains).  
  
**Ethereum**: a Blockchain purporting to use its tokens as programmable nodes in a cloud computer.  It's value has been on a tear lately, and despite having initially sold as an IPO (something many in the community find distasteful) it has been publicly supported by both Nick Szabo and Microsoft.  
  
**Monero**: The largest current Cryptonote implementation, it was the first major Blockchain to add privacy and anonymity into a decentralized and digital Blockchain.  It is tiny at the moment but arguably has the most advanced financial technology in the entire world.  
  
**[Tangle-based Ideas]**:  there are some new currencies that are aiming to work via a new method that doesn't use a Blockchain at all, but I have not fully reviewed them and they are very new concepts.  
  
**[Zerocash]**: the strongest form of cryptocurrency that we have ever invented is actually a little too strong as currency destroying bugs might be undetectable, a non-zero number of trusted parties is required at Genesis, and it is untested cryptography.  Nevertheless research into this continues.  
  
**[R3]**:  Blythe Masters, JP Morgan, and everyone else involved in this are attempting to take Bitcoin and turn it into a 'shared spreadsheet' which is a catastrophic waste of time and money.  A reversible Blockchain that uses trust is the same thing we have now, and defeats the entire point.  They are basically marveling at the Internet, and have decided to reinvent cable television based off of it.

16-02-11,45ayc6,The potential to capitalize on cheap oil.,"While cheap oil is wreaking havoc on the stock markets, it has dropped the price of gas to under $1.50 in many areas. Taking this with the fact that two-thirds of Americans are one $500 bill from financial ruin, one can theories that a large group (maybe 50%) of Americans have limited real exposer to the stock markets. If this is true the only impact that the low oil prices have is the savings that they see at the pump and in lower prices on general transportation costs.  In general these Americans are doing better today and have more money then they had a year ago.

Twitter's user base has essentially remained stagnant at 300 million in 2015, raising concerns about future revenue growth.
Twitter announced nearly 60 percent year-over-year revenue growth for 2015. For the fourth quarter, earnings came in 4 cents above expectations at 16 cents per share on $710 million in revenue, in line with consensus.
Twitter said Wednesday that it expects first-quarter revenue of between $595 million and $610 million, disappointing Wall Street, which had been expecting guidance of about $633 million, according to StreetAccount.
At the same time, the company is confident it will expand its fastest-growing business in direct response, or ""advertisers looking for clicks and conversions"" from their tweets.",1

Oil slumped to a 12-year low during trading on Thursday, but is up as much as 5% on Friday morning as the world's most important commodity bounces back.

Both major benchmarks, Brent crude, and West Texas Intermediate, surged back from big lows on Thursday. As of 10:30 a.m. GMT (5:30 a.m. ET) Brent is up by 5.1% to $31.59 per barrel, while WTI is up to $27.38, a gain of 4.5%.

The price of oil has been yoyo-ing massively over the past few weeks, with rises and falls of as much as 8% per day not uncommon. That volatility is reflected by the surge in the CBOE Oil Volatility Index, which has just passed its biggest peak since the 2008-09 financial crisis. The US based index jumped 7.3% on Thursday, and now stands at 77.79. Here's how that looks:

So first off full disclosure I may be slightly bias. I also own 8 shares, which equals 79% of holdings by North Polo Securities. 

[Some chick talked, sounds like she’s got 2 boobs]

[Guy talks, gives dislcosures] 

Vince, So.. market sucks dick, but it will pass… we hope. Arrowhead is open research so you’re on your own, they don’t need to report shit. 

Vince gets Chris Anzalone, CEO, out. He repeats the same fucking thing about being uncomfortable about the market not reflecting market. Basically both are like fuck… should have sold my shares at $7. End of the day he says 4 things 1) Tech works 2) Working real problems 3) Capital Now 4) Additional Capital (DONT YOU DARE DILUTE FUCKER)
[Continued]

Continue showing Arc-520 doing WORK. The next step, multiple dose phase 2 studies. Five different locations, 200 patients, Got hoez in different area codes. Good chance to see evidence THIS YEAR, the CEO of the company thinks the odds of this are really good, … shocking. All HBB proteins… RNAI, RECORDS. Then reminds of the monkeys 7 out of 9 cured, Saving STD’s in monkey communities, one monkey at a time. 

Confidence in functional duties. If they do see data in 2015, how soon until investors can be getting that dick wet? He’s going to tell us. Well it’s hard to decide… which could happen at any time… so “stay tuned.” Basically no answers, what a faggot. Competitors? Well there’s meaningful competitors and BIG PHARMA is getting in but we are way ahead and don’t need steroid treatment, if HBV treatment comes through in next 12 months they are the most likely bitches. Arc-521 could be good for some bitches and Arc-520 could be good for other bitches, EVERYONE CAN GET DAT HEP. 

End of 2nd Quarter, 2016 more studies. Arc-AET which helps with rare disease is starting to crank up. Orphan drug in Europe recently… not Ukraine Europe… more civilized esque. Been enrolling in Australia.. and Europe (cough, England) Complete enrollment and top data in 2016. Talks about how the disease grows, ALL I WANNA KNOW IS HOW TO GROW DAT GUAP, SCIENCE!!

Building on success…… Talking the science, clearly not the stock price. Company has expanded… headcount, equipment, facilities. We’re doing this because eventually we want a facility on the fucking moon. We’ve been pedal to the metal. We need capital though…. because we wanna keep going HAM we need to pull back on some other programs…. We’re going to take advantage of that.. some of the early stage programs are going to slow down. Sure can fund these by FRIENDLY SHAREHOLDER METHODS… Liquidity looks good for the next 12 months, so milestones by then full yolo. 


Bruce Givens get the fuck on the track!!!!!!! Bruce jumps in and shouts outs to all his baby mamas before moving into presentation mode. (For those that were curious there was 3 baby mama’s, 5 children.. this guy fucks) 

Guy can’t pronounce preliminary. It’s frustrating… fuck they are talking about the 7 monkeys again… One of the chimps had a major “flair” similar to Jennifer Anistons flair. Virus produces proteins… secretion … “secretion..” these all play a role in viral lifecycle. ARWR swoops in and says NOPPPPE GIMME DEM PROTEINS… Virus is like FUCK how do I do work with a tank when I aint got no gas (gas=proteins) 

Running through the science… nothing new. We get it.. the monkeys. Get some more monkeys. Do something new. Monarch Study is enrolling plus a bunch of other studies. Toleration is very good. (We knew this too) Worst thing seeing is respiratory issues (Lets check study I bet STD’s and Smoking is correlated.. just saying) and headaches. Planning for late 2016 submission time. Healthy volunteers and patients.. are in studies. N O T H I N G F U C K I N G N E W

Now Bruce passes off to Ken Myszkowski. He’s the CFO… doesn’t fuck.. no baby mama’s so just goes right in. Finances be fucked. Losing money. It’s a biotech… not surprised. Guy can’t talk either. Actually everyone is mumbling and shit this time (CONCERNING) 70.6 million cash vs. 90.8 million since September. 21.1 million in cash actives. Brief overview.. passing mic back FUCK HERE COMES THE DILUTION I HAVE A FEELING

Mad people will find Arrowhead attractive. best safety profile in the field. Capable of targets. So much excitement. expecting to go HAM… AND I QUOTE IN A BAD ASS LITTLE SMIRKISH (Im listening) RESPONSE HE SAYS…. I EXPECT TO SURPRISE A LOT OF PEOPLE THIS YEAR. 

QUESTTTIOOOOONSSSSS

[FIRST PLAID BOY] Hey love what you’re doing Chris, but what do you wanna see data wise because you’ve got sooooo much data. Also #2 but any interest in someone buying. #3 you said you burned 21 million… EXPLAIN DAT MATH WITH 70 MILLION LEFT… HOW YOU GONNA SURVIVE 12 MONTHS… OKKKKKKK GOOD FUCKING QUESTION PLAAIIDD

[Chris] Agrees… Patients being recruited. Rest assured, recruiting active as a whore with Hep. All E-positive showed signs, also E-negative.. everyone showing immunity UPPPP. 

[PLAID BOY INTERRUPTION] Criteria for an announcement? 

[Chris] I DON’T KNOW PLAID BOY STOP ASKING FUCKING BAD ASS QUESTIONS, STOP PUTTING ME ON THE SPOT YOU’RE FUCKING EMBARRASSING ME. So no.. and I quote… “can’t give a hard and fast rule” ;) Hard. Fast. 

So collaboration…. absolutely. As Bruce as mentioned in the past (Not me, but very well could be because qof my vast knowledge as well) But 520 is going to be a powerful drug, other experimental drugs talking about including but basically this is all about dat 520. Oral would be fine, talking to a company about Oral. J&amp;J… ??? WHAAAAT. FEEEEEEEELS GOOD ABOUT COLLABORATION THIS YEAR. AGREED HAS AN OPEN DIALOGUE WITH SUITORS AND FEELS SURE COLLABORATION THIS YEAR. 

Dat money… yes trend will be higher. But….. this is more an expensive quarter… 

[PLAID BOY] Says ok… doesn’t give a fuck all he hears is COLLABORATION. NOBODY CARES ANYMORE… ARWR IS DA FUTUREEEEEEE.

[Bruce] Bruce jumps in but was taking to idol_lies. 

[PLAID GIRL #1] SUPPPPEERRR ASIAN LADY ASKING QUESTION… TIME TO PUT LIFE SAVINGS IN (they are smart) 

In Multiple Phase studies… clearly showing promising results. It’s too early to talk about partnerships……………………………………………………………….WHAT. He wants dat loot, greedy mother fucker. 

[PLAID GIRL #2] Asks directly about J&amp;J. Is it not the right time because creating more value or DO YOU JUST NOT GOT THAT REAL INTEREST. 

#2 things. First thing is big pharma has woken up to this. It used to JUST BE USE. But now we made a Kate Upton and everrrryyyy mother fucker wants to come get a feel. I just think we are the closest thing at this point. If there will be a breakthrough this year by virtue of action and how deep we are in clinic (clinic = kate upton) there is sooooo much more room in value. Wants to get into 200 studies before shopping dat shit. 

[PLAID GIRL #2] Lady wants to know about dat capital. 

Yeah we have tons of access to capital. We have value. We have points where we could go BOOOOOOOOOOOOM. Moon dust all over you fairy faces. We have largely crossed and still are crossing that validation. We have access to that capital from partnerships. We have awful lot of progress. Lots of capital should be available. Doesn’t sound as strong as what he was saying earlier, definitely doesn’t sound like deal is right on the verge of happening.

[PLAID GUY #3] Bruce did you say registration for Arc-520 in 2018 timeframe?

HUHHHHH…. I NEVER FUCKING SAID THAT, WATCH YOUR FUCKING MOUTH TED. I DIDN’T EVEN SAY A TIME FRAME. YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP WHEN YOU TRY TO STIR UP SOME BULLSHITTTTT.

Timeframes…. we’ll let you know. We expect ARC-521 announces expectations EXPECTED RIGHT AROUND MID YEAR OR RIGHT BEFORE MID YEAR. HE SAID THAT. IM HOLDING. NEED TO BUY MORE OPTIONS. If we were sitting on a billion dollars of cash, nothing would change. Don’t be such a faggot Ted. 

[PLAID GUY #4] Must point out… James Gash…. guys name is James Gash. So you’re not only one going after HBV so how does 7 year exclusivity apply. 

GREAT QUESTION GASHY, CAN I CALL YOU GASHY? So hopefully we can have more then 7 year patent but… yeah we definitely hope to get dat. (this is Bruce, who fucks) Patent exclusivity should last over 7 years.

GASHY MUMBLED…. HES ADORABLE. 

No it’s not exclusivity to all of the RNAI.. NOW EUROPE YOU CAN. EUROPE ALSO GIVES YOU A CUT, BRUCE FUCKKKKKS. In both USA and Europe can get pediatric … first to market in Europe in orphan drugs… big. My favorite line… Bruce, “So Europe and the USA are different”

[PLAID GUY 5] TOTALLY MISSED THIS ONE.. FUCKING LADY IN MY OFFICE TALKING TO ME.. FUCK PAM!! SHUT THE FUCK UP IM TRYING TO GO YOLO SO I CAN FUCKING QUIT. 

Answer.. Milestones, Quite comfortable. Feel good.

16-02-12,45et3t,"[Discussion] W/ Autonomous driving goals, the hunt for the tech companies that will provide the hardware is on.","Note that all the below is my opinion and is open for discussion. Criticism is always welcome.

My current predictions are that Nvidea and Intel will be the first in the fight as massive players in autonomous driving hardware needs. Ford itself has overcome some large hurdles in the software development such as getting it to work on snowy roads and will seek to use either company as its hardware provider.

I also believe Tesla will have one of the first fully autonomous systems available on the market. Even with their push to make their cars more affordable, they won't be able to flood the market which won't have an initial big effect on the hardware providers, but it will initiate the push for large players like Google to set up driver-less taxi systems which will have a *much* greater impact on driving up value of companies such as NVDA and MSFT.

Does that mean that companies like NVDA, MSFT, and INTC are good buys at the moment?

I think it's safe to say NVDA will be a solid buy at -22.50. Regardless of autonomous driving in the far future, it has dropped from +33.75 in the past 3 months (a 33% drop) for no real reason other than market fears. I believe as the market continues to drop, so will NVDA. But I can only see 22.50 as its bottom.

MSFT and INTC I believe will hold true to their value with +/- 4% from current value until autonomous driving really does take off. Which I predict we'll see large scale use of these systems in 5 to 6 years.",6

Health care became GV’s largest investment category in 2014, topping consumer, data and artificial intelligence, enterprise and robotics. In 2013, only 6 percent of GV’s investments were in health care. That jumped to 34 percent in 2014 and 31 percent in 2015, and Maris may expand his team of five partners who cover the industry this year.

Volatility isn't going anywhere for a long time. You're not going to miss out on the gains that make you a billionaire. You can trade again on Tuesday and oil is still going to be historically low and there's still going to be volatility in currency and macro events causing swings in gold, etc. etc.

Trading in 3x levered ETFs IS YOLOing, which is fine

16-02-12,45c8e5,Investing vs Speculation,"I received a private message asking me to define an investment. I thought I'd share it with everyone to open it up for discussion. The following text reflects my opinions and shouldn't be considered investment advice.

&gt;As simple as it sounds, many people have different beliefs regarding the words investment and risk. These varying beliefs creates different strategies, the backbone for all their financial decisions.
&gt;
&gt;I view an investment as an opportunity that will allow me to forfeit value now to potentially receive more value later with a unique property of protecting the initial value.

&gt;That last part is extremely important because it's what differentiates buying a lottery ticket and investing in a business. Notice that I said, ""to potentially receive more value later."" The most important facet in an investment is its ability to protect the original value. An investment doesn't have to make money all the time, but it cannot lose any money ever. The downside is 0, or low, and the upside is unguaranteed. This is consistent with the idea of expecting the worst in all times and situations, and, if anything else happens, that's great! The concept can be summarized, ""Heads I win, and tails I don't lose much.""
&gt;
&gt;A new question arises. How can we measure risk? And what is risk? Some people measure risk by looking at how much the price of a stock likes to move. They believe that a volatile price indicates risk. But this is far from the truth. They are looking at the paper but not the business.
&gt;
&gt;The reality is that stock prices must eventually follow business performance. So it would make sense to associate risk with the underlying economics of the business. For example, what is the risk that Walmart will be swallowed by Amazon? Or what is the risk that an American manufacturer will be defeated by cheap Chinese imports?
&gt;
&gt;This concept asserts that price is not the same as value. Warren Buffett put it this way, ""Price is what you pay; value is what you get.""
&gt;
&gt;For example, a friend of mine bought a used car for about $2,000. But the Kelly Blue Book value was about $8,000. He paid a price of $2,000 and received a value of $8,000. He then totaled his car in an accident and MADE money [insurance paid him $8,000], about $6,000. We call this $6,000 a margin of safety. It is the gap between value and price.
&gt;
&gt;So using this concept we calculate the intrinsic business value (that's a whole different discussion for a later time) of a business. And then we pay less than that to acquire it. Now, if we crash the car, we'll at least break even.
&gt;
&gt;This is the art of business valuation and investing with a margin of safety.
&gt;
&gt;Don't confuse investing, which should require a margin of safety, with speculation. Speculators buy something and hope that someone else will pay them more for it. That's like buying a Pokemon card (or a house lol) and hoping someone else will want it more than you in the future. Investments rely on safety; speculation relies on hope. And ironically, most speculators think they are investors.
&gt;
&gt;There are countless securities. But they're essentially all pieces of paper that represent an economic interest in governments or companies. The most basic are bonds, which is debt, and stocks, which is equity or ownership. But when valuing these pieces of paper, one still looks at the underlying economic factors and risks.

16-02-12,45f8gl,How not to get fucked with options during earnings,"This is something I see is not well understood, so without further ado:

1. The price of options is related to 'implied volatility'. More IV = more chance of the option changing in value = higher option price.

2. When does a stock move the most? During earnings. When is IV high? Before earnings.

3. What happens after earnings? IV drops, lots.

Here's a nice graph of the IV of FB options.

http://i.imgur.com/DXvuZhS.png

I assume you can work out from this graph when earnings are.

Be guided accordingly.

Adding: To be a bit more helpful, that means if you want to play an earnings report with options, you want to be a net seller of option premium.

If you think it's going down, try a [bear credit call spread](http://www.theoptionsguide.com/bear-call-spread.aspx) (sell calls below the money, buy calls at the money). The value of the calls you sell below the money will be higher than the value of the calls you buy at the money, hence it's a net _credit_ spread - you get paid up front. Like a whore.

It did not specify when it bought the shares or what stake it had acquired in the firm, which has previously raised more than $5 billion in several financing rounds.

""We believe that Uber's highly talented management team possesses the necessary vision and skills to build the company into one of the world's preeminent technology businesses,"" Fridman, who is the chairman of LetterOne, said.

JPMorgan's stock is down 20 percent for the year.

Dimon already owns 6.2 million shares, but he has not been a big purchaser of stock, buying only twice in the last 12 years, once in January 2009 when he bought 500,000 shares, and again in July 2012 when he also bought 500,000 shares.

He's not the only one. Several bank insiders have bought stock in the past couple weeks.

Banks: Recent insider buying (source: InsiderScore)

Citigroup: CEO and chairman
Zions: CEO and CFO
Huntington Banc: CEO, CFO, and two others
KeyCorp: CEO and eight directors
Radian Group: CEO, CFO, and five others
These purchases have been significant. In the case of Citigroup, the CEO and Chairman bought $1 million each. Four insiders at Huntington Bancshares recently bought $1.3 million. Radian's CEO not only bought shares, but the bank initiated the first company buyback plan.

Not only are bank stock prices down 20 percent on average, but most of the big banks are trading at a substantial discount to tangible book value.

Banks: Tangible book value

Fifth Third: 0.92
SunTrust: 0.99
Goldman Sachs: 0.87
Regions Financial: 0.84
Comerica: 0.79
Morgan Stanley: 0.72
Bank of America: 0.72
Zions: 0.72
Citigroup: 0.58
JPMorgan is one of the few that trades above book value, at 1.1. Wells Fargo is another, at 1.62. But they are the exceptions.

With bank stocks down this much this year and most of the major banks trading at big discounts to book, look for more announcements of insider buying and buybacks.",13

&amp;nbsp;

GWR opened on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2010. The purpose of this corporation is to hold shares in GWRI, a corporation in Delaware, and it acquired a significant stake (48.1%). GWRI operates principally in Phoenix, and is focused on water resource management that owns and operates regulated water, wastewater and recycled water utilities in communities within Phoenix.

&amp;nbsp;

GWR very recently filed paperwork with the SEC to be co-listed on the NASDAQ, which, to my understanding, usually leads to a large jump in liquidity and price.

&amp;nbsp;

As to the financials, and here is the part that I'm trying to understand, they've gone from mediocre performance to pushing out a TTM FCF yield of nearly 20% (edit: much higher, as FCF is reported in USD), and prior to this initiated a very healthy dividend (not withstanding their special dividend). They don't appear to do anything other than hold their shares, so my question is: where did this jump in cashflow come from?",1

Let's say I have a unique investing strategy, and some friends and family want me to manage a bit of their money.

What are the tax implications for doing this? I'm specifically interested in these events:

1.) Friend/family member hands me a check to put into my investment account. 2.) Taxing realized gains/losses per year on this singular collective account. 3.) Cashing out a friend/family member's portion of the account if they want out.

On their own, each of the above events would constitute a ""tax"" on however money is changed hands. However I would think (or hope) that this is not the case, as you would get taxed so hard you'd have nothing left at the end of the day. So how do small time unlicensed managers do it? I know the following apply but I'm not sure how it works in this instance:

1.) You can receive/gift up to $12,500 per year without it being taxable 2.) I can legally manage up to 15 people's money before being required to seek licensing from the SEC.

16-02-12,45gbfp,SIEN,"Sientra sells breast implants in the US market. They have about 12% of the market and have been growing that share. Sientra is one of only three companies allowed to sell breast implants in the US, the other two being Allergan and Mentor, a J&amp;J division. Sientra is a relatively new company, composed of many former Mentor and Allergan execs and sales reps. Jeffrey Nugent, Sientra’s Chairman and new CEO, was previously the CEO and President of both Revlon and Neutrogena. Several members of their senior management team, including the CEO, have a history of completing acquisitions (both ways). 

In order to achieve the best surgical outcomes and a better quality perception, Sientra only sells their products to board certified plastic surgeons. Demand for breast implants, for both cosmetic and reconstructive reasons, is increasing every year. The gross margin of breast implants is very high.

I have been invested in Sientra stock since November when I posted it to /r/wallstreetbets [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3t4i4z/dd_sien/). I posted it there because it was wildly undervalued but had a fair amount of risk. However, it is no longer a risk play since this Monday, when Sientra stated that they are putting their implants back on the market starting on March 1st. (a particle confusion issue was the reason why the stock price fell from $26 to as low as $2.78) It's no longer a YOLO and I believe it is a great value play, especially given that it has fallen 20% since the [de-risking announcement](http://investors.sientra.com/news/news-details/2016/Sientra-Announces-Return-of-All-Products-to-US-Market/default.aspx). The book value is about $7.50 a share ($1.11 for one year's worth of inventory, the rest essentially cash) and the share price as I write this is approximately $8.00.

Sientra will likely leverage their cash position and loyal following to increase their sales presence in the US for breast implants, as well as expand into other high-margin markets (i.e. dermal fillers) that can be sold to board certified plastic surgeons. I believe that by expanding sales (which they have been doing until the end of Sept) and entering new markets, Sientra will have a strong quarterly profit by the end of the year. Currently, I calculate about 96% of the float as institutional-owned, with about 18% short interest as of late January (probably 30% right now though).",0

That’s what Citi Research oil and gas analyst Faisel Khan did Friday when he downgraded Linn Energy (LINE) and its sister firm LinnCo (LNCO) to Sell. The stocks are trading at 38 cents and 17 cents respectively on Friday. The company announced last week it is exploring “strategic alternatives related to its capital structure,” considered code language for likely bankruptcy.

“What is this, stomping on the grave?” tweeted Kevin Kaiser, energy analyst with Hedgeye Risk Management, a research boutique (Kaiser was recently profiled in Barron’s).

I want to ask some advice on a strategy on how to win(or do well) in a competition that I will explaim to you now. 



First off this competition is hosted by a very large investment company in South Africa. The competition has a prize of R100 000 (~$6200). I am currently a high-school student in South Africa and I am very interested in economics and the stock market and thus this competition sounds like a good challenge to me.



Now for the details/rules regarding the competition. There is a budget of R1 000 000( ~$62000) and the competition runs for three months from March. You can buy South African stocks and certain International stock (still to be confirmed). As far as I know there will not be any index/etf funds available to invest in and they do not allow shorting. The winner is the person with the highest percentage return.



Now this is where I need your advice, the competition runs on a very short time-scale. The usual 'buy-and-hold' won't work as well as this relies on total percentage returns thus my brain tells me one just 'yolo' and hope for the best. Any advice?

They have an earnings coming out later this month which I think will be shit as commodity prices have dropped, seasonal nat. gas demand has dropped with the mild US winter, and they've been dealing with extra costs due to the massive methane leak in Cali. On the topic of the leak, they have a fuck ton of lawsuits (over 65) and charges against them in the right now. I think they'll have to come to some sort of settlement soon which will likely be significant and drive value down further. They have insurance which should cover the projected settlement costs, but the PR and potential legal ramifications could be significant. 
One more potential 'out' related to the leak is that the fix they put on is only temporary, it may not even work... And once it's sealed they apparently have to abandon that well, so they'll either lose projected revenue and market share, or try to make up that production elsewhere which will increase forward costs.   

Regardless of the lawsuits, I think poor earnings due to increased costs and lower demand+prices will likely fuck them hard. If it doesn't happen this report, then probably the next one. Adding the potential recession, energy crisis, and lawsuit related shit, I think there're plenty of reasons to be bearish.

I've got, to make it easy, 2000 options that I can purchase at a dollar, these are estimated to be worth 400 each at the time of sale. Now I don't know what the terms of sale will be as of yet but I do have some question regarding the one time capital gain exemption and removing the limit and then having extra left over.
What I think I would like to do is take full advantage of the exemption and then roll over the other portion that is in investment into another investment, will this allow me to not pay all of the taxes right away? I want to roll it over into an investment property which will remove it from the grey market and into real estate. Does anyone have experience with this type of transaction or any idea of what kind of taxes I will still be liable for? I'd like to take my tax exemp money and buy a new primary residence.
Some additional information is that I work for this company currently as a contractor at a yearly rate and these options are only executable at the time of sale. Any advice with how to retain as much as this wind-fall in my hands would be much appreciated.

16-02-14,45p2mv,Best place to learn about the stock market?,"Hey,
I'm 17 and want to look into the stock market, I am keen to trade but obviously I need to educate myself first - so does anyone know where I should start?

I have looked around and so far I have found Wall Street Survivor which I like, or liked until the showed me the $200/annum membership. 

I am also keen to try virtual trading to learn about the market - I have found trading 212 which gave me £10k virtual to start with, it mostly a FOREX trading platform though and I'd like to start with shares -it does shares as well but doesn't have some (small-cap) companies.

Also, I'm keen on trading short to mid-term, over a few days, a month probably at most (depending), that sort of thing - is this a good idea, bad idea, where do I learn about people that do this?

Thanks in advance for any help :)",14
16-02-14,45p3s4,Bank of America (BAC) is trading well below book value.,"BAC looks too cheap to pass up. Here is some info:
 
 * Down 30% YTD
 * Trading at 0.75 Price/Book value
 * 1.67% yield
 * Forward expected 2016 PE is ~8
 * Has exposure to bad oil company loans but not a huge amount (estimates put oil exploration and services company loans at 1.5% of total commercial credit exposure). 

Anybody else interested? I think BAC is a mediocre company, is badly managed and is inefficient but it is looking very cheap fundamentally. Please discuss, or convince me this is too risky.

since marijuana is on the cusp of being legalized in Canada, I figured that the price of their medical marijuana stocks will literally explode once legalization occurs, as the licensed medical suppliers will be the ones most likely to offer recreational weed once it is legalized and regulated. it is projected to be a 5 billion a year industry in Canada.

I bought $29,000 worth of Canopy Growth Corp/Tweed (CGC.V) on Friday after I saw the snoop dogg deal... as tweed is the largest medical marijuana company by market cap, and I have read nothing but good things on how the company is run.

then to be even more speculative I bought $1000 of cannabix tech stock (CSE: BLO, US OTC: BLOZF), who are working on a pot breathalyzer for law enforcement. you can be sure that if they can make a product that works that police all over the world will buy it.

there is just so much room for this industry to grow that I really feel that I am investing on the ground floor. the market right now is an $80 mil a year industry with 30,000 patients enrolled in the health Canada medical marijuana program.

tweed seems like the best positioned company to take advantage of legalization, and at a current share price of $2.72 the increase from an $80 million a year industry to 5 billion would be an increase of 6300%... which would make this the best investment since Bitcoin as far as appreciation goes. so tweeds stock would be worth $174 assuming they had 100% market share... they currently have 25% market share, so that would be a share price of $43.... an increase of 1750%

keep in mind that regulation is happening in Canada, the new government has said that they plan on legalizing it soon, so it's really just a matter of when not if that this stock explodes.

C'mon reddit, help a guy out here.

Here is the definition of qualified replacement property for background as can be found in:https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1042

""(4)Qualified replacement property

(A)In generalThe term “qualified replacement property” means any security issued by a domestic operating corporation which—

(i)

did not, for the taxable year preceding the taxable year in which such security was purchased, have passive investment income (as defined in section 1362(d)(3)(C)) in excess of 25 percent of the gross receipts of such corporation for such preceding taxable year, and

(ii)

is not the corporation which issued the qualified securities which such security is replacing or a member of the same controlled group of corporations (within the meaning of section 1563(a)(1)) as such corporation.

For purposes of clause (i), income which is described in section 954(c)(3) (as in effect immediately before the Tax Reform Act of 1986) shall not be treated as passive investment income.

(B)Operating corporationFor purposes of this paragraph—

(i)In general

The term “operating corporation” means a corporation more than 50 percent of the assets of which were, at the time the security was purchased or before the close of the replacement period, used in the active conduct of the trade or business.

(ii)Financial institutions and insurance companiesThe term “operating corporation” shall include—

(I)

any financial institution described in section 581, and

(II)

an insurance company subject to tax under subchapter L.

(C)Controlling and controlled corporations treated as 1 corporation

(i)In generalFor purposes of applying this paragraph, if—

(I)

the corporation issuing the security owns stock representing control of 1 or more other corporations,

(II)

1 or more other corporations own stock representing control of the corporation issuing the security, or

(III)

both,

 then all such corporations shall be treated as 1 corporation.

(ii)Control

For purposes of clause (i), the term “control” has the meaning given such term by section 304(c). In determining control, there shall be disregarded any qualified replacement property of the taxpayer with respect to the section 1042 sale being tested.

(D)Security defined

For purposes of this paragraph, the term “security” has the meaning given such term by section 165(g)(2), except that such term shall not include any security issued by a government or political subdivision thereof.""",8

I'm not sure if it was an isolated incident with either the stock I owned (SQQQ) or the brokerage firm I belong to (Robin Hood)... 

I had a stop loss on my shares of SQQQ to protect myself from a loss greater than 5%. Immediately after the interest rates officially increased, there was something that I can't describe any better than a sharp downward spike in the share price, followed by a notification that my shares had all been sold (for a price below my stop-loss)...

This happened in a matter of seconds, and **when I refreshed the chart, the downward spike wasn't visible-** in fact, the shares were increasing.

How can a greater than 5% decrease in stocks happen but not even get recorded on the chart? I saw it on the chart in one second, and in the next it wasn't there...

As you can see by this chart ( http://i.imgur.com/BVBFmbZ.png ) I lost a sizeable return that I should have got but because of this glitch**?** my shares were forcibly sold because of my stop-loss.

Yes.. long term view, dollar cost average, index fund, all that.  I get it that you should only own stocks that you would buy more of if the price went down, but we aren't all Warren Buffett.

I bought Skyworks (SKWS) based on good fundamentals, attractive price etc.  I spent about a week researching it and took the plunge at like $85.  AAPL and the broader market took it down in short order.  I stopped out at around $75 because I use stops and don't totally trust this market (but lets save that for another discussion, I like stops but you don't have to like them or use them).

-It's the 2nd biggest service provider in the world and arguably has the best technology of anyone in the world other than its rival slb in which it is on a level playing field. 

-There's a lot of uncertainty with the merger between them and baker hughes which has caused the price to lower making it in theory a better deal.

-Its value closely follows the price of oil and oil is at an all time low.

-Oil price will most likely go up given that there is an oversupply right now. The only reason it hasn't corrected itself yet is because more time is needed for existing wells' production to slow and reinvestment in them to stop.

A tanker chartered by French energy giant Total SA is expected to sail with 2 million barrels on Monday, the officials said. Two others will carry 1 million barrels each for Spain's Compañía Española de Petróleos, or Cepsa, and Litasco, the trading arm of Russia's Lukoil, they said.

The ships are carrying a portion of a flood of new oil that Iran says it is producing since world powers agreed to lift Western sanctions related to the country's nuclear program. Those sanctions crippled Iran's oil industry, reducing its export capacity by more than 1 million barrels a day.

Just looking to put some money in a fund really.

I do have a few questions however.

I've noticed lower market cap leveraged inverse ETF's/stocks have larger positive swings when the market goes down.

As such I've seen when the S&amp;P goes down 2% - larger cap ETF's which are 3x inverse leveraged pop around 6% while the lower cap ETF's pop anywhere from 10-15%. Why is that, and which ETF would I have a better return on - assuming the market continues on a downward trend? Is the risk assumed both ways on larger/smaller market cap inverse ETFs? Would it go down the next day 10-15% (on the smaller cap) if the market reverses and the S&amp;P gains 2%? Would the gains (on the smaller cap) hold more than reverse assuming the markets stick with the current bearish sentiment? 

How does that equivalent exchange work? Why don't more people invest in the smaller cap ETF's with such a greater return? 

My overall thought is I'll probably spread a distributed amount of  cash towards some leveraged inverse ETF's (3x), (2x), (1x) and *possibly* invest in a little gold.

Can anyone recommend some good inverse ETF's and other stocks/commodities?

* Mathematical indications of potential financial distress found in financial statements

16-02-15,45vc6i,Need Broker Advice,"So this past 6 months I have been researching about investing and trading.  I think I have a pretty good plan for some initial investments. (Investing in a Vanguard Mutual Fund that tracks the S&amp;P 500, a crude oil ETF, and then a few small risky short term trades.)  My question is how the fuck do I actually get started??  In everything I read it doesn't talk about how the trades and investments actually get made by non-brokers.  Should I use an online broker? If so which one?  I just really need someone to point me in the right direction.  Thanks!!",1

I'd like to open a discussion about fundamental analysis. What are some of the red flags you all look for in terms of analyzing a company fundamentally when considering a **long term investment** (i.e. NOT a trade)? Specifically I am interested in:

* Mathematical/textual (e.g. in SEC filings) indications of potential fraudulent behavior and/or ""creative"" accounting

* Mathematical indications of potential financial distress found in financial statements

The stock didn't move that extremely so they must have some special rule when indexing that seriously discriminates against just Walmart. Does anyone have any insight into why this is.

By far the biggest change, at least as far as the impact on Tesla buyers goes, is the ban on transferring Tesla's extended warranty and prepaid service plans to a new owner when selling a used Tesla. Owners of those plans can cancel and get a pro-rated reimbursement when selling the car, but they can no longer transfer it when selling the car. Previously, transferring those warranty and service plans to a new owner cost $100.

16-02-15,45xas6,Can someone explain the math behind Puts in a simplified form?,"Can someone explain the math behind Puts in a simplified form?

My confusion lies in that it seems like a large risk for a relatively small reward for the writer of the Put, and a relatively small risk with potentially huge rewards for the buyer of the Put.

Am I correct in assuming that the pricing of the Put is factored in by the writer, thereby fluctuating with the odds of a stock dropping, so Puts near the current selling point cost more than Puts far away from the current selling point?

For a real world example, let's use Tesla (TSLA). It's currently trading at $151.04 and there is a current real world Put option for Feb 19 priced at $4.35 with a strike price of $150.00.

Let's say I'm bearish on TSLA and I buy that put, thinking the stock will tick down to $150 or lower tomorrow morning.

According to the options calculator, if it hits $150 today (assuming the markets were open) I would make an 11% profit. Tomorrow I would lose 0.7%, then 14% Wednesday, 30% Thursday, 50% Friday then finally 100% on Saturday.

So say the market opens and TSLA goes up. I want out because I do not think it will hit the $150 strike price this week.

What happens when I exit the Put early?

I am looking for a quantitative answer that tells me at which points I should be willing to invest money, by the way, not a qualitative one.

One thing that many calculators seem to neglect is that my risk preferences vary based on the current amount of money I have and the frequency with which bets are offered to me. I am not very willing to risk going into severe debt on a one time investment opportunity, for example, but if I were offered an infinite number of 100000:100001 odds on a coin flip then of course I would take that chance repeatedly.

Is it appropriate for me to do this calculation separate from a Kelly Criterion calculation, or should I be doing them simultaneously? Since both seem to rely on the current amount of money I have, it occurs to me that separating them might involve some misleading assumptions about the way I will use my money. I don't really know how to do the math on this issue, I only know that it's complicated enough that it needs to be done.

If there's a different subreddit where this question might better be asked, please let me know. I know this isn't the most technically inclined source of investing advice available online.

16-02-15,45ytd2,What is really going on in China,"China is on the edge of a currency crisis.

For the last year Chinese growth has been slowing. Confidence has been eroded with people starting to believe that the peoples republic has been falsifying economic data. Capital flight of Chinese citizens and business's are skyrocketing. The country is now burning through foriegn reserves at an unprecedented rate attempting to slow the downward pressure on the RMB. Another devaluation is a certainty.

Currently China is still reporting a economic growth rate of 6.9%. How accurate that is no one really knows. Some estimates have it as low as 3-4%. Meanwhile the money supply has grown by 14% in the same period. Over the last year Chinese business' and citizens have moved and estimated 1 trillion out of the country. Forcing them to burn through reserves to support the currency value. This is currently happening at a rate of about 100 billion per month.

Now China does still have a large current accounts surplus slowing the net outflow. Despite this surplus net capital outflow is still over  200 billion per quarter. At the same time they are slashing interest rates making it less appealing to keep savings in the country. Exports are currently down 11.2% while imports are down 18.8%. If this trend continues it will only accelerate the problem.

The biggest problem in this is China is attempting the ""Impossible Trinity"" of macroeconomics. Maintaining a fixed exchange rate, free flow of capital, and independent monetary policy together is not possible. This can't work it never has. The end result is almost always a full blown currency crisis.

It's not as if the purchasing power is much different; I blew through 30,000 yen in about the same time it would've taken me to spend the equivalent in USD (~$260).

I've heard explanations before but none really made it clear. Is it because the yen is the smallest denomination, while we have pennies and nickels, etc? In other words, is it like comparing a penny to a dollar?

I've also heard people say it's because of WW2, when the Japanese economy was totally devastated and the yen lost pretty much all of its value, and it's been working its way out of that hole, so to speak, for the past 70+ years. But this doesn't seem right to me considering Japan's economy recovered so quickly from the war and was for a time nearly the size of our own.

The tech giant, a prolific issuer in recent years as its overseas cash pile has grown, is looking to sell between $10 billion and $12 billion of new bonds to help pay for share buybacks and dividends, according to investors. Apple has been widely followed in the debt market since it sold $17 billion in 2013, which at the time ranked as the biggest corporate-bond sale on record.

16-02-16,461jzu,*BREAKING NEWS* - SUNE stock price turns negative. Unprecedented event.,"Reuters. February 16, 2016

Following a holiday long weekend in the U.S. and broad market volatility over the last few weeks, an unprecedented event has unfolded as SunEdison, trading on the NYSE under the ticker SUNE, has entered negative price territory for its common stock.

After sliding from a high of over $30 in the first half of 2015, SUNE closed at $1.42 on Friday, an all-time low for the stock. After markets closed Friday the stock hovered around the $1.40 price after-hours as traders closed out positions and left the office for the long weekend. But on Monday, a bank holiday in the U.S., someone began unloading the stock in droves outside of regular exchanges. Brian Lee, the research analyst from Goldman Sachs covering SUNE, was reached by satellite phone from his Yacht in the early hours of Tuesday morning.

“I can only say what I’ve seen come across Bloomberg and read online. There was a big seller in Europe on Monday - apparently someone didn’t realize it was a holiday in the U.S. - and they were trying to exit a very large position and kept cutting their price since nobody in the U.S. was bidding. Somehow, rather than have buyers pop up, we had at least three other large sellers start pushing orders out from desks in Asia and Australia. Rumor is that bankruptcy is in the cards and nobody wants to – and forgive my language but I’m quoting what I’ve read – “deal with the shit that keeps on shitting.” In any case, someone started putting out negative bids and they started getting filled. I’ve never seen anything like it.”

Reuters has learned, through complex internet backtracing, that the buyer of these trades was a previously unknown North American hedge fund operating as “WSB Yolo Delight LLC.”. While we have not been able to find information on the fund – almost no documentation exists and they’re not registered in any legal jurisdiction – we were able to get in touch with one of the senior fund managers. 

“Yeah, some retard didn’t realize the U.S. market was closed Monday and was trying to unload a lot of stock” said Dick “Chainsaw Vasectomy” Pound from Dildo, Newfoundland, Canada. “Some lads and I have talked about starting a long-only fund but our investors keep pulling their money out before we have a chance. They love weekly options. Anyway, I saw these offers for SUNE pop up Monday and with all this talk about negative interest rates, I thought what the hell, I’ll put out a negative bid. Next thing I know, we’re getting filled – literally being paid to receive SUNE stock.”

Mr. Pound said the trades will have to settle during market hours on Tuesday, but the fund is expecting to take on around 10 million shares of SUNE and receive approximately $16 million in cash. He also says they're happy to take more.

Mohamed A. El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at Allianz, tweeted on Monday night that “some shit was about to go down” and that “everyone should get the fuck out of the pool,” probably alluding to the trades happening over the course of the day. Reuters is working to determine if the NYSE, and indeed if even any bank systems, can handle negative quotes, but as of publishing has not been able to confirm.

“India is getting paid with oil to take oil. Japan and Europe are getting paid to borrow money. Why the fuck can’t we get paid to receive stock?” Mr. Pound said on a follow up call. When asked about WSB’s next move, he said that UWTI, a leveraged oil index fund, was about to go down on him. Elaborating, he said “Probably by the end of this week we’ll be primed to insert from the top and start bidding negative prices for UWTI. We know there’s a risk that other funds start trying to emulate us, but we're not worried. Traditional funds are twigs on the forest floor, while we are a mighty bundle of sticks.”

16-02-16,461tak,YOLOing Galena (GALE)?,"So last month, GALE shares were absolutely thrashed when the company announced a $20m secondary offering.  Went from 1.50 all the way down to .59 at one point.  The price was also driven down by the company divesting its commercial business, which they had made such effort to acquire over the past couple of years.

They now have all their eggs riding in their Neuvax basket and are devoting all of their resources on getting it to market.

What is Neuvax?  Well, those of you who are familiar with TPIV know what breast cancer vaccines are all about.  Only difference is while TPIV is theoretically working with better technology and launching P2 studies, GALE's vaccine is already halfway through Phase 3 and could be on the market for years without competition.

So what makes this a good point of entry?

Company watchers have pointed out the design of the P3 study - it's due to release interim results to the FDA when the 70th cancer recurrence occurs out of a pool of 758.  This covers both the experimental and control arm, and people have made statistical projections indicating that we're now at the point where there is effectively zero chance that the vaccine effectiveness will be &lt; the 30% required for FDA approval (a la herceptin).

See this article for detailed projections: http://seekingalpha.com/article/3837936-neuvax-vaccine-matter-signal-integrity-part-2

The stock, since being beaten down, has been quietly and steadily accumulating every day, with some massive, ie 300k share buys, right at the closing bell.  All without news. It seems that people are catching onto the fact that the longer the 70th is delayed, the better the results will be.  With the dilution and divestment, they have enough cash to last until mid-2017, so no immediate worries on that front.

So you're looking at two plays:

Short term - 70th recurrence announcement and submission of interim data to the FDA.  Unfortunately, this is blinded, so the results won't be public.  HOWEVER, all signs point towards a very-certain ""proceed to completion.""  In the best case scenario, the FDA might even order a halt for efficacy and put GALE on the fast track to commercialization.  Both cases will cause the stock to pop.  Expect the 70th announcement near the end of this quarter or the beginning of the next and the FDA ruling to come out a couple months after that.  There is also a P2 study due to be announced with the National Cancer Institute for Ductal Carcinoma, but I don't know too much about the design of the study (obviously, not announced yet).

Long term - Early 2018 is the P3's study's primary endpoint, and this is where commercialization happens if the FDA doesn't order an early halt for efficacy.  My gut says it can easily run up to $10-20/share as breast cancer is a HUGE market where they'll be first on the scene.

Disclosure, I've been long GALE since $0.66.  32k shares.  SP is currently $0.78",5

Bought 10K UWTI @1.53, nearly shat myself while I watched it go down to 1.17, but it came up today and I sold today  @1.65 ($1140 profit)

Bought 10K UWTI @1.60 because I think that oil will go up again. Bought it too soon as it is currently ~~@1.52~~. @1.45 and going down. 

**What I have learned**

* Decay of UWTI in 8 days has been -1.2%

* These extreme volatile cases or not something to think long about. I should have sold much sooner and bought much later and I would have had much more profit.

* If you see it go up, buy and sell. If you see it go down sell and get into DTWI or cash. It is better to loose 1% and watch it drop another 5%, than it is to wait till it goes down 6% and wait till it comes up again. Those are all wasted opportunities.


*This is what I have learned and what I would do different, not advice for you as your situation is different than mine*",8

16-02-16,462lth,Hedging an Oil-Heavy Portfolio,"I was doing research on industries with a low correlation to WTI, and came across [this paper](http://www.accessecon.com/Pubs/EB/2012/Volume32/EB-12-V32-I4-P267.pdf).

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;""It is finally worth noting that the weak values of the constant conditional correlations
(CCC) between oil and stock markets suggest potential diversification gains from adding the
oil asset into portfolios of stocks. Moreover, three CCC coefficients with oil market returns
are negative (Consumer Staples, Financials, and Telecom Services) and two coefficients are
not significant (Healthcare and Industrials sectors) suggesting higher diversification benefits
for these sectors.""

&amp;nbsp;

There is an ETN I found, CAPE, linked to the Shiller Barclays CAPETM US Core Sector Index. Basically, the ETN represents an investment in the four US Sectors which are deemed to be relatively undervalued. At this time, it is represented by an equal weighting in Consumer Staples, Healthcare, Industrials, and Technology. The ETN represents a 0.98 correlation to the S&amp;P 500, and has a MER of 0.45%.

However since i already hold PM and Mo im worried about too much exposure to the industry but i see RAI as a more short term (6 - 12 months) investment and for that duration only holding around 3% of my overall portfolio.

16-02-16,462rxb,Would removing the majority of cash from the US economy really have a large impact?,"There's been a recent spate of news about potentially removing a majority of the cash from the both the European and American economies. Some suspect that the main incentive the government has for eliminating cash is to allow them to implement NIRP (Negative Interest Rate Policy) without fear of a run on banks as everyone rushes to take their money out.

Theoretically, this makes sense to me. People don't want to see their saving decrease for no reason. But practically, would this actually work? Would even the slightest NIRP actually lead to a huge bank run? It seems a bit odd to actually prefer to have 5 figures+ in cash lying around that could easily be stolen. Not to mention, couldn't individuals put their money into other places like PayPal or Venmo (obviously not 7 figures worth of $, but still a substantial amount at least)? Or even BitCoin or an alternative crypto-currency (I understand that's technically an investment as well, but its still an alternative). Or am I missing something there. 

I'm no financial expert- this just seems like a lot of hand-wringing over the slow removal of physical cash when there are still digital alternatives, and when individuals might not all rush to grab as much cash as they can.",11

16-02-17,465mbz,The Ultimate Market Timing Feat,"I was a Morgan Stanley and then Wells Fargo stockbroker and PM.  We were told to tell clients constantly that they shouldn't time the market.  Because I was a contrarian and a risk-taker, of course I tried.  And I succeeded.  Wildly.  I mean, sometimes I wonder if I lived in New York I I'd be on CNBC all the time with my track record.  It always seems like common sense but of course I developed the skill over a lifetime and starting out I made terrible calls. Anyway, I could detail all of them in my career (and I do some on my blog) but I'll mention the ultimate: I SOLD MY BROKERAGE PRACTICE itself as the ultimate act of market timing.  Look at it this way...  I was with MS and they were squeezing brokers who weren't rainmakers.  I had told my clients to ""not buy"" starting in November 2007 into March of 2009.  March 10th of 2009 I told clients to buy.  Still, you obviously don't get sales telling clients to avoid buying your product (though it was the right call).  I start looking at my options and find MS won't let me sell my practice internally.  So went indie at WFC Finet and built my own practice and owned my own book.  Come 2014.  After five years of a Fed ginned-up rally, I decided... ""the pattern is: strong hands exit quietly.  We top out and tread sideways as this happens.  Finally, when strongs have turned over inventory to weaks, we'll get rising volatility and a bear market... until inventory turns again.""   So I sold my book to my partner and told my clients to expect a ""sideways market.""  I did it early enough that I was two years gone into the sideways market I expected before the drop happened.  So... wen your product doesn't sell itself and the robots are thinking they can beat you.  ALWAYS HAVE AN EXIT PAN FOR YOUR TRADE.  And thus the ultimate timing of the market for a smart broker is when HE exits the business.  Long story short, I cashed out and waited....  and now that we've had the drop I'm ready to ease back in on my equities allocation.  Last bit... my evidence is my kid's college accounts.  Those are the ultimate tests of the market timer because the rules were you could only change allocations ONCE A YEAR!  So when I went 70% cash in April 2008 and 100% equities in April 2009, and let that ride until going 100% cash/fixed at dow 16,500 in April 2014... and then finally going 40% back into equties on Jan 20th of this year at Dow 15,500... (reducing beta and increasing alpha all the while)... I often laugh at the simplicity of this game.  And that's how it's really done!

**Background**

In my country (Norway, though the same principles apply everywhere), there's a huge discrepancy between loans in terms of how much equity you need to put up when getting a housing mortgage.

Some of these private banks here are offering no-down mortgages, putting more and more buyers on the market, which seems to be artificially inflating housing prices. People are buying houses on interest-only loans, and re-selling for a profit when the loan is mature. Normally, I wouldn't think too much of this, but it seems to be becoming a trend.

I wouldn't call these loans subprime just yet though, because a steady income stream is pretty much mandatory, but I feel like tendencies are pointing to the idea that banks might start tapping into the subprime market sooner or later.

Investment banks enjoy these mortgages of course, because they set up mortgage-backed securities and earn tons from collateralized debt obligations, and the private banks earn fees from selling mortgages. I mean, it's only a matter of time before new bubbles arise right?

**Question**

If I personally start to fear that a bubble is arising and might burst, what's a good plan of action in order to secure myself financially? Are credit default swaps something to consider on a personal basis, given that you can buy CDSs on obligations you don't really have a stake in? Does anyone even sell CDSs to the average citizen?

Berkshire sold 12.7 million shares of AT&amp;T in the last three months of the year, putting its stake at $1.6 billion as of Dec. 31.

Berkshire also reported that it bought 26.5 million shares of Kinder Morgan, taking advantage of the 63% slide in the company’s stock price over the past 12 months. The Houston-based pipeline giant has been hurt by weakness in its carbon-dioxide segment and depressed commodities prices.

16-02-17,4667rw,Is now the time to invest in Sony?,"Looks like Sony plans to put out their VR headset very soon and I was wondering what yall think about the company at it's current price. P/E isn't unreasonable, they have a dividend, and have sold over 35 million PS4s (hardware ready). You look at companies like Nintendo where they thrived on hardware. I feel like that's what PS4 consumers are ready for come 2016.

http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/gaming/2016/02/16/gamestop-ceo-playstation-vr-launching-fall/80448444/


VR gaming should be a big hit. Looks like they are coming this fall:

Sony is a well known respectable brand. I take a look at their max chart and they're rock solid. If you take into account the dot com boom, financial crisis of 2008, Tsunami of 2011, they've been pretty rock solid in terms of shareholder performance. 

http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=SNE+Interactive#{""range"":""max"",""allowChartStacking"":true}

So with that being said, with VR on the horizon, would you say Sony could be a bargain right now at it's current price? You have Oculus which will either be over $500 and require a great CPU or the $1500 package which is pretty expensive right now given the state of the world economy. Gear VR has a controller but most of those games won't come close to what Sony has with the PS4.

From research online, it seems like the glory days of HFT was maybe early 2000s where a lot of money was to be made and it was still relatively new.  Nowadays, there is much more competition across multiple HFT firms and increasing government scrutiny on the practice, so the money is not as easy.  From what I can tell, the increased government scrutiny on the practice hasn't really materialized into anything concrete at the moment in terms of legislation or additional taxation, but who's to say future legislation would not cripple the industry.  ""Flash Boys"" brought HFT to light a couple of years ago, but I get the feeling it served more for entertainment rather than a rallying cry against HFTs.

Ethical arguments aside regarding HFT firms, or the effects of a new president (Bernie vs. Billary) could have on them, what is the opinion of the future of this industry?

16-02-17,4670pf,"You're trading wrong, and here's why.","I've seen a lot of talk lately about brokers, commissions, transaction taxes, and high frequency trading and such.  Generally topics that relate to order execution.  So I thought I'd share some tips.

Most of you probably only turn over your stock portfolio annually or even less, so this stuff isn't a huge deal to you, but shaving a few basis points of your transaction costs could mean a few extra dollars here and there and who doesn't like a few dollars?  If you do have high turnover or trade large volume this could be very valuable.

First off I'm a huge advocate of Interactive Brokers.  Their commission structure and execution tools are top notch, and I'm not aware of any other US broker that comes anywhere close to competing with them on those fronts.  I mention IB because a lot of the things I'm going to talk about are only available to non-professionals through them in the US as far as I know.

1) Algorithmic Order Execution.  Frankly, if you're not using algorithms to execute your orders you're behind the times and you're bleeding tiny amounts of money that you're unaware of.  Very few institutional traders/professionals these days are NOT using algos to make trades.

The idea of algorithmic execution is to break an order up into smaller component lots, usually of 100 shares, and fill the order over time and ideally at more favorable prices instead of in one bulk lot at a fixed price and point in time.  

This is most beneficial if you're submitting larger orders, because it masks your activity, which should reduce the impact your orders have upon the price of the stock.  It makes it impossible for any predatory HFTs out there to target your trades and steal your pennies (too complicated for this, but true).  Even for small orders there's just no downside.

[HERE](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/?f=%2Fen%2Ftrading%2Forders%2FvwapAlgo.php) is an example of a type of algo order called vwap, which is the most common algo order type and an effective choice in 99% of situations.

Most algos like this also have the advantage of spreading your order out over time, so you don't have to worry about picking the perfect moment to submit a trade.  By default an order like vwap will fill over the entire course of the day, but can of course be modified to the pace you desire.

2)  ""Flat Fee"" vs ""Per Share"" commissions.  I know it can be intimidating to try and figure out per share fee structures, but in almost all cases I've ever seen the per share fees will be lower.  This is especially true for very small orders, like I imagine many retail investors like yourselves are making.  There is absolutely no reason anyone should be repeatedly paying $10 (or even $5 really) to make small trades.

In addition to already probably being lower cost you can get creative and (at least through IB) select a fee structure which passes some exchange rebates back to you if your order ADDS liquidity.  I'll talk more about that in a moment, but it is possible to get some exceptionally low commissions by adding liquidity with your orders.

warning: **be aware of monthly minimums**.  If you hardly trade at all or have a very small account then you may be charged a monthly maintenance fee which negates any benefit of this.  I think the monthly minimum commissions that need to be generated to avoid a fee is $10, but look it up.

3) Marketable vs Non-Marketable orders.  At any point a stock will have a bid price and an ask.  The difference between those prices is called the spread.  

If you submit an order to buy at the ask or sell at the bid, then you are submitting a marketable order.  Your order will be matched with the already existing offer and the transaction will take place immediately.  Market orders and limit orders at or above the current price are marketable orders.  These are also called liquidity TAKING orders - they remove standing offers.

If you submit an order to buy below the current ask, or to sell above the current bid, then your order is non-marketable.  This is also called a liquidity ADDING order.  The order will sit at the exchange and fill only if another party out there decides to come to your desired price for the transaction.  Liquidity adding orders often generate rebates from exchanges.  IB offers the option to pass some of that rebate on to you as mentioned earlier.  Other brokers just pocket it.  Its small, but beneficial if you trade a lot.

Rebates aside you still don't want to be submitting marketable orders all the time regardless of order type or broker.  If you cross the spread frequently, meaning you buy at the ask and sell at the bid, then you are losing to the spread on your trades.  example:  The bid is $5, the ask is $5.02.  If you buy at the ask and later sell at the bid then you've lost $.02 on a trade where the price of the stock didn't move even a penny. That's a **-0.4%** loss just from lazy order execution, and in the event of larger spreads it can be much worse.

If you don't need to fill the order as quickly as possible then it is generally better to use an order type that floats on the favorable side of the spread and allows other market participants to come to you for their fills.  Sometimes you may feel like you got a worse price, sometimes better, but over the long run it is an advantage to add liquidity and be hesitant to cross the spread for fills.

____________

Those are my three big tips I guess.  Optimal order execution is a challenge that probably isn't worth the time or effort for most low-turnover retail investors, but you can definitely reduce your transaction costs by a substantial amount if you're diligent and willing to figure things out.

There's nothing terrible about using a conventional retail broker and paying the $5-$10 commissions if you trade very low turnover, or have a small account, or you get some additional benefits from the broker like banking services, research tools, etc.  But I suspect there are a LOT of people out there flushing away $100s or $1,000s every year by being lazy in their execution and/or brokerage selection.

We actually have the next major resistance level at 1990. This is about 3.5% above current levels. We would not be surprised to see that level approached within the next 2 months. One theme we have noted is that it looks like the market does NOT like Janet Yellen. She does not seem to inspire confidence in the markets. However, recent economic data has been consoling and Fed voter Dudley has dissauded the market that negative rates in the US are an imminent possibility. The market seems to like that. Negative rates are not good for banks.

**Bonds:** The MAR16 US bonds continue their slide from the 170’s, now down another 1.7 points to 164’03. 162’10 looks like the next key moving average support level. Once the stock market showed strength, the bonds really started to tumble!

**FX:** The MAR16 USD is down slightly, basically unchanged on the day. We believe the USD will continue to rally this year and ultimately breach new highs and stay in the 100’s. We believe the Fed will hike rates at least one more time this year. The MAR16 Pound came back slightly this morning after a big down day yesterday.

**Commodities:** MAR16 WTI is up 6.4% to $30.91. The high 28’s, as we noted just yesterday, was phenomenal support for this contract. $28.75 turned out to be a key barrier. APR16 gold is up $4 today to $1212. $1220 may be a good short term magnet for gold. MAY16 coffee is up slightly to $1.1725. We believe coffee’s volatility will increase over the next few months and we believe the price will move to the upside. $127.50 is the 200 day MA which could be good resistance. If coffee can stay above that level, we believe it is in store for a big sustained rally to at least $1.50.

Share on Twitter
Boeing Co. secured a $1.3 billion order for narrow-body planes from Okay Airways, with the Chinese regional carrier set to decide on its first wide-body order by the end of the year as it seeks to expand internationally.
Okay Air agreed to buy 12 single-aisle 737s, with an option to purchase eight more, Chicago-based Boeing said in a statement distributed at the Singapore Airshow Wednesday. The Chinese carrier, which is headquartered in Beijing and counts Tianjin as its hub, is purchasing eight 737Max-8, three 737MAX-9 and one 737 NG900-ER.
The purchase on the second day of the Singapore Airshow comes amid speculation that the heyday of big orders from India and Southeast Asia is ending, and that airlines in the region might have to delay delivery of planes as economic growth slows. Boeing expects China to overtake the U.S. as the world’s biggest aviation market in 20 years.
Okay Air Chairman Wang Shusheng told reporters Wednesday that the airline needs more planes with its load factor at 90 percent. The carrier plans to fly to Hawaii and Fiji using wide-body planes, and will decide between Airbus Group SE’s A350 and Boeing’s 787 by the end of the year, he said.

Most developing country currencies have also been hard hit, with the Russian ruble losing nearly 21% and Brazilian real losing 30%. Bitcoin, a borderless currency that is governed by mathematics, outperformed any other currency in 2015.

A study by Magister Advisors shows that Bitcoin could be the 6th largest currency by 2030 for volumes traded. Estimates show that banks and financial institutions are set to spend at least $1 billion in the cryptocurrency in its development and for its underlying technologies. Bitcoin is attracting the sharp attention span of Wall Street, and we can therefore conclude that bitcoin is undergoing substantial development and progress, and contrary to the recent media opinion, is quite definitely alive.

I’m up 71% with my portfolio and I feel that everything I trade turns into gold. While I’m having great success with my trades, I’m also having great success in real estate. I just successfully sold my house and I’m going to buy another one in November. Everything is going smoothly ;-D
But there is this stock: Northern Shield Resources (CVE: NRN). I’ve been making a few plays on it and making some really good profit. I’m well aware that it’s a speculative mining stock but until then I had made a lot of money on it. I actually bought my shares at $0.38 the first time and the stock went up to $1.40 a few months later. In August, I decided to use part of the down payment for my future house to average up and buy more stock at $1,00 or so. In September, I then had $15,000 invested in NRN with an average price of $0.76. I’m still making profit but holding my position as the company will announce results of their latest prospecting in a few weeks.
I already made plans as to how I will spend my extra profits. I truly believe the stock will rise to a few bucks (maybe $5 if I’m lucky!) and that I will have enough money to not only buy my house, but a BMW and a nice trip down south at the same time… my wife is going to be so proud of me!

Here are the most important numbers for each product as of the first week of December 2015:

Yahoo Mail: 56.9 million total daily active users or DAUs (down 11.5% from the first week of December 2014); 24.4 million mobile DAUs (down 2.9%); and 1.2 billion total minutes per day, or 20.8 minutes per user per day (down 31.6%)

Yahoo.com homepage: 52.6 million total DAUs (down 16.5%) 11.3 million mobile DAUs (down 0.8%); 471.3 million total minutes per day, or 9 minutes per user (down 28.5%)

Yahoo Search: 43.5 million total DAUs (down 8.8%); 13.7 million mobile DAUs (down 10.3%); 606.4 million total minutes per day, or 14 minutes per user (down 18.1%)

It wasn't all bad news — Tumblr, Yahoo Weather, and Yahoo Sports all had increases in daily users.

Yahoo has been under pressure to sell its core internet business, which includes properties like Yahoo Mail, the Yahoo.com homepage, and Yahoo Search, but the overall drop in active users could make it hard to find a buyer.",1

On Wednesday S&amp;P cut its rating on Saudi Arabia's debt to 'A-/A-2' from 'A+/A-1.' 

On October 30, S&amp;P cut Saudi Arabia's rating to 'A+/A-1' from 'AA-/A-1+.'

A debt downgrade makes it more expensive for sovereign issuers to borrow money. 
S&amp;P notes that Saudi Arabia is currently prepared for a deficit of 13% in 2016, but the firm believes the kingdom's budget assumptions are based on oil trading at $45 a barrel.

The ruling by Sheri Pym on Tuesday requires Apple to supply highly specialized software the FBI can load onto the phone to cripple a security encryption feature that erases data after too many unsuccessful unlocking attempts.

Federal prosecutors told the judge they can't access a county-owned work phone used by Syed Farook because they don't know his passcode.

By default, Apple has encrypted its iPhones to allow them only to be accessed using a passcode.

Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people in a Dec. 2 shooting at a holiday luncheon for Farook's co-workers. The couple later died in a police gun battle.",0

&gt; Saudi Arabia’s groundwater will run out in the next 13 years, according to a water expert at King Faisal University, reported the Saudi Gazette.
A faculty member at the university, Mohammed Al-Ghamdi, made the announcement following an issued report by the World Bank on global natural water scarcity.
“Official estimates have been disclosed showing an acute drop in water levels in agricultural areas, and that indicates the seriousness of the situation,” said Al-Ghamdi.
**The drop is largely due to agricultural consumption, which makes up 95 percent of total usage.** Industrial and human consumption make up the remaining 5 percent.

&gt; **Saudi Arabia relies mainly on its groundwater, which accounts for 98 percent of its total water sources**, and water from desalination plants.
According to Al-Ghamdi, the depletion causes a threat to main crops like wheat, barley, forage, and fruits, which use large amounts of water.
He said the only way to solve the problem is to renew groundwater.
Prince Faisal bin Bandar, governor of Riyadh, also called for the conservation of water as well as energy, another excessively used resource in the Kingdom.
“Water and electricity are very important to each and every one of us. Let’s conserve them and use them properly and wisely,” he said at the Saudi Forum on Water and Electricity on Sunday.
However, Saudi’s Water and Electricity minister said the country will need an investment of $133 billion (SR500 billion) for power projects over the next 10 years to cope with rising demand.

Starbucks and some other eateries are under fire from a health advocacy group over high sugar levels in their hot drinks.

U.K.-based Action on Sugar has released a report claiming that many commercial district hot drinks contain as much sugar as a can of cola.

Some of the hot drinks contained more than 20 teaspoons of sugars., it said.

It's ""yet again another example of scandalous amounts of sugar added to our food and drink,"" said Graham MacGregor, Action on Sugar chairman.

The top offender was Starbucks, which had seven of the 10 worst offenders. Its Venti Grape with Chai, Orange and Cinnamon Hot Mulled Fruit, contains a whopping 99 grams of sugar – the equivalent of 25 teaspoons — per serving, the group said.

Starbucks' Chai Latte Venti had 13 teaspoons, according to the group.

Action on Sugar says Starbucks promotes that drink as a healthy option.

16-02-17,46ajk4,"New in the game, but wanna yolo. I got questions and need inspiration!","I just started day trading a bit.
Got some money and set up an account with a CFD trader.

I have invested a fair bit of money before that in the last year (100x what I am daytrading) but it was not mine, i had to play conservative buy bonds and etfs or mutual funds, and i am doing really bad so far.

First week trading I have made 1k euros playing the market even though I don't think I am rly good at that shit..

I have many questions about how to play. I am not looking to time the market like a prophet but I follow the news and some info I have through the trader and made some good buys and shorts so far, even on the same stock to take advantage of volatility. 

My trader offers CFDs of shares from US and Europe, Forex trading, Commodities and Indices (snp500, nasdaq100, eurostoxx and an index for every european country and some emerging markets).

I have a different bid and ask price but no pay/trade. 
So far I am buying and selling stocks every hour following news and forecasts and made some good money.

I did some forex trades and made a quick buck but just folllowed info from the trader. I got no idea how they work or what my risk is exactly.

I bought some index and made most of my money off of it (nasdaq today long and last week short) but again i got no idea how i buy it and what my risk is or even if i buy an etf or another derivative.

What should I be trading apart from nasdaq and individual stocks of big companies? 

How much is the risk doing Forex?

I have been reading here about options and read on investopedia about the difference with CFD and I have come to the idea that since I am outside US I should just stick to CFDs.

I really enjoy this community, memes and all and really I have devoted this money to make yolo plays and buy a car or build an empire who knows  (it's not like my savings or anything just walking around money). ",5
16-02-17,46ajk9,Has there ever been another point in history where central bank policy had such direct consequences on the market?,"I'm not much of a history buff when it comes to the market so I was curious as to whether this is a mostly unprecedented circumstance or if it has been a common theme in the past. It seems as though asset prices are more correlated with Federal Reserve (and other central bank) policy stances than anything besides oil, and I'd argue that Fed policy disproportionately affects the price of oil as well.

It seems as though much of the immediate future of the market comes down not only to the macroeconomic conditions but also to central bank policy. Macroeconomic headwinds have worsened? Market better rally, that means central banks around the world may be pumping more money into assets via QE or reducing rates even further.

The Fed and other central banks appear to be more willing and eager to enact massive QE and ZIRP/NIRP than ever before, on a scale never seen before. Deflationary headwinds are obviously a concern in some parts of the world, but core CPI in the US is chugging along around the 2% pace. As oil recovers (even if that is only to $40/bbl) CPI is sure to return to a similar benchmark as well. Is this the new future of the market, where asset prices can be sustained and manipulated indefinitely by central bank policy? The reality is that the market and the economy as a whole are human constructs, and given that there is the political will (eg approval) the Fed and other central banks have the authority to print money to remove toxic assets from the real economy until their face turns blue.

Does anyone see the level of central bank interference in the market drawing down in the future, or is this merely the new normal that comes with Keynesian economics?

[Interesting Brad DeLong excerpt on the intent of Fed interest rate policy](https://youtu.be/8RrKScRg5KM?t=53m38s)

&gt;""But it leads to policy conclusions very much like those that the Obama adminsitration is trying now. That whenever you have a big set of fluctuations in financial market valuations that the government needs to step in. The government needs to step in and provide a Keynesian crutch. Not because we want to rescue the princes of Wall Street and the feckless investors that have lost money from their deserved bankruptcy, but because letting financial asset prices crash and overshoot on the downside and stay down that low on the downside puts the jobs on millions of Americans in danger and puts the jobs of tens of millions of people in Asia in even more danger. [...] So you have all kinds of crutches to try to keep the economy on an even keel even though financial markets are sending crazy and wildly erratic and volatile signals to the real economy about what the real economy should be doing. And that's what we're doing right now. That's why Ben Bernanke has done everything he can to drop the safe interest rate on the assets thought to be secure as close to zero as possible.""

From what I understand, Effective duration is an underestimate of the rate of change of price in a bond relative to a change in yield. Using a line tangent yield curve at price zero, you can then estimate the percentage changes based on the tangent line.

Say you are trying to estimate a price change from a 250bp shift, why can't you calculate the difference of smaller and smaller shifts to get a more accurate representation of where the price will be?

Lastly, we have the yield curve, we should know exactly how much a bond or bond portfolio will change based on the yield curve. Are we estimating duration simply because we can't account for changes in the yield curve?",1

16-02-17,46b589,Questions regarding The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional CEOs and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success,"The book proposes that unparalleled success has come from CEOs that defy conventional Wall Street wisdom. 
They disregard growth for growth's sake. These CEOs have taken their businesses and streamlined them by selling/spinning off non core and underperforming assets. When they made acquisitions, those acquisitions fit into a vision for the company's future. 

They placed a low priority on maximizing revenue and EPS. The rationale being that these incurred higher taxes. Instead they sought to increase cash flow and would use depreciation/amortization to offset taxes paid. 

Furthermore, speaking of taxes, they usually repurchased shares and eschewed dividends viewing buybacks as the tax-efficient means to return value to shareholders. Some CEOs when they thought their shares were overvalued, would use them almost as capital for acquisitions.

Next, they used debt/leverage in a pioneering way. I don't fully understand, but my understanding is that they first established stable/predictable revenue then used leverage to augment the company's returns. I imagine it is the same with Apple's decision to issue bonds even though they are sitting on &gt;200 billion cash reserves due to tax efficiency.

Last, they encouraged decentralization and eliminated middle men with the CEO not far removed from the actual business. They also gave their managers a lot of autonomy.

My questions are (1) How can I deduce these from financials/news and (2) Does CEO Ginni Rometty count as an outsider CEO?

Regarding (1) How do I know when a company is taking on debt and underreporting earnings that it is due to tax-efficiency rather than financial incompetence?  

Regarding (2) I often wondered why Buffett has kept his investment in IBM. Buffett mentored one of the CEOs mentioned in the book and it seems that he would then be familiar with the outsider CEO investment style. IBM has done a lot of divestitures and share buybacks. Revenue has decreased for the past couple years, but I imagine that is to be expected given all the divestitures. However, gross margin has increased indicating that they are employing cost-cutting measures and supporting the idea that they have jettisoned low-margin businesses. 

Regarding tax efficiency, their tax rate has been at or under 25 since 2010.

IBM tried decentralization under John Akers in the late 80s-90s, but the move did not prove successful.  I have so far been unsuccessful in finding out whether Rometty's plan to restructure and rebrand IBM includes decentralizing.",1

16-02-17,46bau1,Potbelly Sandwich Shop is not cheap but growth and profitability strong - can it make it to the big time?,"Potbelly Corp has just reported strong Q4 and full year results with full year revenues up 14% and adjusted EPS up 22% $0.22 to $0.29.
The company started in 1977 as a small antique store on Lincoln Avenue in Chicago. To boost sales, the original owner began offering warm sandwiches and homemade desserts to customers. A seccond shop opened in 1977 and today the company operates over 350 shops in the United States and franchisees operate over 30 shops domestically, in the Middle East and in the United Kingdom.
Selling toasty warm sandwiches, salads and hand-dipped milkshakes all made fresh-to-order - Potbelly has struck a chord with customers and is very much in a rapid expansion phase with 53 shops opened last year and revenue growth of 14%.  But more importantly comparable store sales were up 4.4%, profitability was up with shoplevel margin increasing from 18.3% to 19.8%, adjusted EBITDA increased 13.0% to $41.6 million from $36.8 million and the company had no debt as of September with a cash balance of $42 million.
The company issued bullish guidance yesterday  for 2016 with 55-65 new stores planned, comps expected to grow 3.5% to 4.5% and earnings expected to grow by a minimum 20% with EPS forecast in the range of $0.36 to $0.38.
The stock has jumped about 10% to $12.25 today and is trading on a TTM PE of about 42.4 and forward PE of c.34.  Its not cheap.  But with only 350 shops globally its doing alot right and with a strong balance sheet it could go along way.  Do you think its up to it?",1

16-02-17,46bdea,"I have 100K that I need to invest, because it's sitting in a savings account. Suggestions, please.","Hello.  

I am 37 years old and am looking for investment advice for 100K.  I sold my house and am moving overseas.  I will not need to access the money in the next 5 years.  I would like the money to be available, however, after 5 years in the event I decide to purchase a home.  

Background on me:  We have 300K invested between the following funds, 2 Vanguard Target retirement funds, VGENX, VBTLX, VTIAX and VWNEX.  At this time I feel like my retirement funds and allocation is solid.  I don't want to put any more money in to the market at this time.  I still invest monthly from my income.

I have an emergency fund that totals $50K.  

I don't want to invest the 100K in to real estate at this time because I won't be in the US to manage the property and I'm too OCD to let a management company do it.  Besides that, the housing market is in a major overpriced bubble in my area.

My idea is this:  My local credit union is offering 5 year rates of 2.25% on CDs.  I think that I would want to ladder the 100K over 5 years, making some of the investment available at maturation points if I needed it.  If not, I'll roll it over in to another CD.

I know this is probably an elementary question to be asking here, but I was just hoping for any feedback that would be appropriate for my situation.  

My risk tolerance for this money is low, because it's my oh-shit money if my career aspirations don't work out.

Thank you.  ",3

16-02-17,46bu69,LendingTree (Tree) ER Options Question/Idea,"I am strongly considering playing LendingTree's ER on 2/25/16 because I think the stock has been severely oversold/short sold.  The main reason for this sell off over the past 2 months was due to the fact that they announced an increase in Q4 2015 revenue but did not release increased guidance for 2016, from what I know.

So, my question is, if I buy 200 long call options (200 contracts for 100 shares each) half for the ""March 16th expiration"" strike price $70 and half for the ""March 16th expiration"" strike price $85 and hypothetically the stock price after earnings shoots from ~$62 to ~$90 in 3-4 days.  Does LendingTree have enough option volume for me to sell these options for the mega % profit they should be worth or would I most likely not be able to sell them due to the fact that the price change and lack of interest and just have to exercise the option to realize my profit?  If I am going to YOLO $25k+ then I want the chance for the big reward and not just the difference in the strike price vs share price.  I am new to option trading so I wanted to ask some other who may have more knowledge.  There is a link to the LendingTree options chain site below.  Lastly, am I picking the best options available if I believe we will see a 30-40%+ move up 2-5 days after earnings on 2/25/16? Thanks for your response and if I am overlooking something and you think this is a suicidal trade let me know as well, I welcome the thought.

So, what do we know about the parent of De Beers? 

1. It market value is at an all-time low. 

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/swpB6j8.jpg)

Anglo American’s current market value is 60% lower than the pre-commodities boom in the early 2000s. So, why has this company fallen from grace? 
Despite owning 85% of De Beers, it also owns a platinum division, copper division, coal division, and iron ore division. All this is due to falling commodities prices and a slowdown in demand from China.  

On the surface, Anglo American’s balance sheet isn’t so bad, as illustrated by the chart below:

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/E2u4weI.jpg)

Its equity is slightly lower than it was back in 2008 at $21bn, but this is much higher than the $13bn recorded in 2001. 

But deep down, Anglo American is deep in debt. 

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/fuKovM9.jpg)

So deep it surpassed the “$10bn” for the first time at the end of 2015. 
Anglo’s market capitalization has declined likewise. Even more disturbing is the company’s shrinking investment portfolio to an all-time low.

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/G691XTA.jpg)

A liquidity of its long-term investments has not stopped the company declining cash balance and since 2011, it saws its liquidity fell from $19.8bn to $9.5bn. 

And Anglo American’s financial position won’t improve because the company has dire earnings. 

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/mBaeqew.jpg)

It doesn’t look like the company is making a profit anytime soon, as it’s CEO stressed that asset-sale will be accelerated in 2016 to reduce net debt. 
The question on everyone lips are: “Who will be buying?”

16-02-18,46c3ho,SEC: Deutsche Bank Analyst Issued Stock Rating Inconsistent With Personal View,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2016-30
Washington D.C., Feb. 17, 2016 — The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former Deutsche Bank research analyst with certifying a rating on a stock that was inconsistent with his personal view.
An SEC investigation found that Charles P. Grom certified that his March 29, 2012 research report about discount retailer Big Lots accurately reflected his own beliefs about the company and its securities.  But in private communications with Deutsche Bank research and sales personnel, Grom indicated that he didn’t downgrade Big Lots from a “BUY” recommendation in his report because he wanted to maintain his relationship with Big Lots management. 

Grom agreed to settle the charges by paying a $100,000 penalty, and he will be suspended from the securities industry for a year.

“When research analysts tell clients to buy or sell a particular security, the rules require them to actually mean what they say.  Analysts simply cannot express one view publicly and the opposite view privately,” said Andrew J. Ceresney, Director of the SEC Enforcement Division.

According to the SEC’s order instituting a settled administrative proceeding:

Grom violated the analyst certification requirement of Regulation AC, which requires research analysts to include a certification that the views expressed in a research report accurately reflect their own beliefs about the company and its securities.
Grom and Deutsche Bank hosted Big Lots executives at a non-deal roadshow on March 28, 2012.  Grom became concerned by what he believed to be cautious comments by the Big Lots executives.
After the roadshow concluded, Grom communicated with a number of hedge fund clients about Big Lots.  Four of the hedge funds subsequently sold their entire positions in Big Lots stock.
The next day, Grom issued a research report on Big Lots in which he reiterated his BUY rating.  As required by Regulation AC, Grom signed an analyst certification included at the end of the report stating, “The views expressed in this report accurately reflect the personal views of the undersigned lead analyst(s) about the subject issuer and the securities of the issuer.”
During an internal conference call with Deutsche Bank’s research and sales personnel within hours after the publication of his report, Grom said, among other things, that he had maintained a BUY rating on Big Lots because “we just had them in town so it’s not kosher to downgrade on the heels of something like that.”
On April 24, 2012, during another conference call with Deutsche Bank research and sales personnel, Grom discussed disappointing first quarter sales figures at Big Lots and stated, “I think the writing was on the wall [that] we were getting concerned about it, but I was trying to maintain, you know, my relationship with them. So, that’s why we didn't downgrade it a couple of weeks back.”
Antonia Chion, Associate Director in the SEC Enforcement Division, said, “When research analysts employed by broker-dealers violate their legal duty to issue research reports that accurately reflect their personally-held views, they undermine public confidence in the integrity of the research and must be held accountable.”

Grom consented to the entry of the SEC’s order finding that he willfully violated the analyst certification requirement of Regulation AC of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Grom neither admitted nor denied the SEC’s findings.

The SEC’s continuing investigation is being conducted by Drew M. Dorman, Robert B. Hanson, Jason Litow, and Kevin Gershfeld.  The case is supervised by Yuri B. Zelinsky and Antonia Chion.  Kevin Lombardi and Cheryl Crumpton have assisted with the investigation.  The Enforcement Division has been assisted by Eugene Canjels, Samantha Grunberg, and Stuart Jackson in the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis.",10

Excluding a charge for store closings and other items, earnings of $1.49 per share exceeded the analysts' average estimate of $1.46, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Wal-Mart last month announced plans to close 269 stores globally, including 154 in the United States and 115 in Brazil and other Latin American markets.

Costs to boost employees' wages and renovate stores have weighed on profits. Wal-Mart has also been investing heavily to build out its e-commerce infrastructure as it grapples with fast-growing online rival Amazon.com, another factor pinching margins in recent months.

Wal-Mart said operating income fell 16 percent to $6.6 billion in the quarter.

16-02-18,46c90t,Portfolio Help: Lazy 2/3 ETF portfolio,"Hello savvy people of /r/investing!

I’m trying to build a simple 2 or 3 fund ETF portfolio as commonly recommended by [bogleheads]( https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Lazy_portfolios); (US Total Stock Market + International Total Stock Market + Bonds). However my 2/3 fund portfolio will be all equities because I already have a government enforced pension plan at 4% yield that I will regard as my bonds portion. 

The problem is that I’m investing from Singapore. I want to avoid US domiciled funds because of the 30% withholding tax. Ireland/Luxembourg domiciled are a good idea but the brokerage fees of London stock exchange ETFs are prohibitively high for me.  

There are however a small handful of Singapore listed Luxembourg domiciled ETFs by Deutsche available to me, and they all pay no dividends, so no worries about dividends withholding tax. 
My ideal asset allocation would have been 30% Singapore broad ETF, 40% US Total Stock Market, 30% International (as broad as possible).

However, the scant selections in Singapore leave me only with 2 US, 2 Europe, and 1 World ETF. 
Can you please help me decide what to pick from the following 5 ETFs for my 2/3 ETF portfolio? The Singapore ETF is a definite so it’s not in the list. Just need to decide if I should add 1 US + 1 Europe or just the 1 World (which has the highest expense ratio).


ETF|Market|Type|TER
:--|:--|:--|:--    
S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF 1C | USA | Synthetic, capitalizing, no dividends | 0.20%
MSCI USA Index UCITS ETF 1C | USA | Synthetic, capitalizing, no dividends | 0.30%
db x-trackers MSCI Europe Index UCITS ETF (DR) M | Europe | Physical, capitalizing, no dividends | 0.30%
db x-trackers Euro STOXX 50® UCITS ETF (DR) D  | Eurozone | Physical, capitalizing, no dividends | 0.09%
db x-trackers MSCI World Index UCITS ETF | World | Synthetic, capitalizing, no dividends | 0.45%


I like the MSCI World Index ETF but I keep feeling like 0.45% is way too high. 


Are there any good non-dividend paying, Ireland/Luxembourg domiciled ETFs that are listed on a USA stock exchange I can use instead?

GS, -0.49%   have been hit with more than $400 million in paper losses thanks to a plunge in the value of stock bonuses paid out early last year, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis.
J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM, -1.04%  , Bank of America Corp. BAC, -0.48%  , Citigroup Inc. C, -0.87%   and Morgan Stanley MS, +0.47%   haven’t yet reported how much stock they granted a year ago as part of employees’ bonuses, but the declines in banks’ share prices--based on their averages from January 2015--have been equally severe, ranging from a 32% drop at Morgan Stanley to a 17% decline at Goldman. (J.P. Morgan, an exception, is up 2%.)
Most big banks award restricted shares within the first few weeks of the year. The shares often don’t vest for several years, meaning the value of a bonus can surge or plummet over the course of the waiting period.

The value of bonus shares granted in early 2014 by J.P. Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley has declined by about $1.34 billion since the initial pay date, according to the Journal’s analysis, which took into account the number of shares granted and the change in share price from January 2014 to Wednesday’s close.",12

16-02-18,46cjqc,"Don't go long on S&amp;P500 until it gets above 2044 or so","There's been some recent noise about the S&amp;P500 possibly breaking through its 200 day moving average.  Pay no attention to this noise.

In fact, rigorous scientific testing has shown that the [300 day moving average is a more important indicator](http://dailyreckoning.com/a-better-way-than-buy-and-hold/).  

Using the 300 day moving average method, you would have sold the S&amp;P 500 on January 4 of this year at around 2040, and you would still be sitting in all cash.  Applying this method to last year, you would have cashed out on Aug 21 at around 2034, saving your bunghole from the ensuing flash crash on Aug 24.

For reference, the S&amp;P 500 is currently at 1928, and its 300 day moving average is 2044.  That's a SELL signal.

Note that the point of this method ISN'T to time the exact top or the exact bottom.  The point of this method is to BE IN CASH WHEN THE MARKET IS MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO CRASHING.

Link: https://www.ustocktrade.com/

Disclaimer (Personal opinion):

=
Ok before you big money stock option elite give me crap for posting something like this, this is NOT for you. Y'all good where you are. But I thought those who have a little fund, less than $5000, college students, folks with new experience, broke people, Robinhood users, Loyal3 retards, may be interested in this?

What is Ustocktrade?
=

It's some weird alternative trading system (ATS) created by Tony Weeresinghe who has been involved in the development and implementation of stock exchanges around the world. He has provided IT solutions to capital markets in more than 60 sites across 5 continents, including the one used today by the London Stock Exchange Group. London Stock Exchange so you know at least he knows his shit unlike the noobs at Robinhood. How an ATS works is it essentially tries to buy and sell stock not through a broker but directly from institutions. Yes, many of you probably didn't know this but there is a big market where people just exchange stocks directly and avoid the whole broker shit. It matches buyers and sellers directly.

My experience with it:

=
It feels exactly like any other broker except for one thing: An ATS does not have to follow the PDT rules set by the SEC, so your funds settled T-0 as often as you want to. You heard right, you can essentially yolo your whole cash fund in a single stock in the morning, pull out, yolo it somewhere else. As much as you like without being flagged for pattern day trading. So I've been using this for the past month or so and I want to share my pros and cons with those of you who are like me. You were probably on Robinhood and are now considering switching.

Pros:
=
-$1 commission for T-0 trading

-It fucking shows bid and ask!!! Unlike Robinhood you can now see the price at which buyers are willing to buy and sellers are willing to sell!

-No PDT rule applies

-Banking transfer in and out is free and takes 2 business days

-Supports all stocks traded on NASDAQ and NYSE

-Has a web platform + iPhone app (Android coming soon)

-No minimum balance

-They approve anyone within 24 hours. I told them I was a student they opened my account within hours.

-Free real time quotes and a little news

-The real time graph shows you were you bought and sold if you did at all. Something even ThinkorSwim only added recently.

-Has a little trade school where you  can basically paper trade.


Cons:
=
-NO ETFs, ETNs, OTC stock, or NYSEMARKET stocks are supported right now! So if you play stuff like NUGT, TVIX, UWTI, DWTI, SPY, etc you won't be able to trade it here.

-Bad account overview. Unlike Robinhood you won't see a graph of how your gains moved over the day which is straight up dumb. I tried to look everyone but I couldn't find anything so you really just have to remember with how much money you started with.

-Same applies to account statements which are not detailed at all and are posted in pdf the day after.... No way to see P/L in a single place. You will have to do the math yourself. Instead they give you a fucking pie chart like why would I even care.

-NO shorting, no stop limit, only stop loss called ""Get Out""!

-NO extended hours trading!!

-NO options/futures/forex trading either!!

-NO trading of stocks under $1. They will be displayed but you cannot trade them.

-No research tools, technical voodoo or any of that fancy stuff. You will have to find that yourself.

-Execution is not always shown instantly but it happens at the set price.

-Maximum buy execution cannot exceed $10,000. But, sell is unlimited. This was designed to keep institutions out. 

-It is unclear whether your funds are FDIC insured or SIPC or insured at all. It seems there is no requirement for this on alternative trading systems because they are dark money pools.

Neither Pro or Con
=

-[Customer service?](https://twitter.com/Ustocktrade) I don't even know they have anything like that. Honestly the only time I have ever called any customer service is to change my commission structure or an accidental short which should be a nonissue here. But you can always ask their Twitter account and they usually reply.

I expanded one tab on each of the tickers to show you what they look like. You can of course expand all the tabs at once.

=
**Price chart** shows you the real time, Day, Month or Year chart. 

=
**Strategy** is where you can see all the triggers you want to program, be it alerts or trigger stop loss or trigger order at a certain price. 

=
**Transactions** shows you pending orders as well as executed orders of the day.

=
**Corporate actions** I have never seen this thing do anything yet. But, my guess is this is where dividend announcements and reverse splits or dilutions show up.

=
**News Feed** just gives news from StockTwits and TheStreet related to the stock ticker. It's a new platform and I guess they will add more quality news in the future.

Conclusion
=

Who is this great for?

Anyone with a small yolo budget who really wouldn't see a big dent if they split up their funds. You can go $500 into one stock on one day, sell and then do the same thing somewhere else on the same day, multiple times, as long as you have money. If all you do is play stocks and specifically earnings, dividends etc, this is it. If you are the type who feels 100% confident that a stock will blow up tomorrow and you want to roll over your whole fund from one to another, this is the one. Ustocktrade's mission even says that it was designed for young adults who don't have the funds to get access to the way big traders trade.

=
Who is this not designed for?

Elite traders who rely on perfect execution, elite traders who need ETFs, ETNs, options, and forex, elite traders who buy and sell more than $10,000 worth of shares in a single transaction, elite traders who short, my message is: If you are already spoiled and don't mind paying $7-10 commission where you are, this is not worth it. But, if you are a Robinhood trader with a relatively small fund and you have other means to find DD, technicals, etc, this is better.

Do I recommend it? Fuck, I use it. It feels just like any broker. Switched from Robinhood to TDA margin to Robinhood and now Ustocktrade, and have been playing stocks with this ever since. I think the most important thing here is T-0 trading and the presence of bid and ask which already make this 5x better than Robinhood because you are not left in the cold about how big the spread between the two numbers is and you can pull out whenever you feel like it and re-enter at a lower point instead of averaging down like some fool. **I'm here to answer any questions I can answer about my experience**. I will be the Ustocktrade guy of wsb, just pm me or reply here if you want to switch. And no I didn't get paid for this. Could care less. I just think Robinhood users deserve more flexibility.

A: No, I cross checked with any broker I can find and they display the exact same prices at the exact same time. Bid and Ask. They say they show NBBO and it feels exactly like any other broker.

=
Q: Any hidden fees? Where's the catch?

A: No catch, the founder is some type of philanthropist who believes that college students could pay for college by stock trading (hey, why not?). The costs are covered by the $1 commission.

=
Q: Do I have to lie during sign up to be approved like the other brokerages?

A: Nope, like I said they encourage college students to sign up. Jut pick student and don't worry about the other income crap.

=
Q: What is PDT?

A: PDT or Pattern Day Trader rule is a rule set by the SEC that says any margin account (T-0 settlement) can only do 3 day trade round trips in 5 business days unless the account is more than $25,000. But, this rule only applies to the traditional definition of a brokerage. What this guy did here, because he's smart is design a brokerage that does not fall under the definition so you can yolo the crap out of it without getting in trouble.

=
Q: How does that affect taxes?

A: Hmm I honestly don't know. I would think no matter how you got the stocks you would still pay capital  gains and be eligible to write off losses.

=
Q: Should I use a more informative platform and DD along with this?

A: There is no other way to do it. This broker is barebones. You will have to find other ways to analyze the stock. This platform is just for buying, selling and keeping track where it is. Nothing else.

=
Q: Can I transfer my Robinhood shares to Ustocktrade?

A: That's called ACAT. Ustocktrade offers a free transfer in. However, Robinhood does not support any form of ACAT right now: https://support.robinhood.com/hc/en-us/articles/203583765-Broker-to-Broker-Transfers

=
Q: Are there other ATS's around or is Ustocktrade the only one?

A: Well, I am only familiar with Ustocktrade as the only one accessible to regular people, but here is a list of all the others, maybe you find something: https://www.sec.gov/foia/ats/atslist0116.pdf


**Edit 1:**

16-02-19,46iia6,(Hypothetical) Expected lifespan versus expected annual real return.,"This is a thought experiment I have pondered for a while and maybe someone else has some opinions to share :)

Let's say instead of the average person living for 80 years, the average person lives for 20 years or for 200 years.

If I was expected to die at the age of 20 I would not be stoked for 7% annual returns for ""the rest of my life"" because if I am lucky my investments would double once in my lifetime. (I assume people would go to school until the age of 6 and that the average person won't start aggressively saving for retirement until the age of 10... And that they retire at the age of 16 or 17). In this world investors would demand a much higher return than 7%.

In the case where I am expected to live until the age of 200, a 7% annual return would be great. You could save normally as most people do today and retire at 60 with enough investments to last a lifetime. 140 years without having to work and about 100 years in fairly good health. However, I believe that in this case real returns will drop to much lower than 7% otherwise the vast majority of people will be living off of the profits of a relatively few number of workers. An equilibrium with a lower expected real return should be found.

Is that the case then? The real return decreases the higher the species' lifespan... And the equilibrium is at some point... Such as where the median income earner investing a reasonable amount can be expected to be able to live off of their investments precisely when their body becomes to worn out to work? (Or some other constant income percentile and constant savings rate across all lifespans)

What happens if two different intelligent species live together but their lifespans vary dramatically?  Would the species with a lower lifespan even care to invest?

Of course this is all hypothetical, I don't think humans lifespan will increase enough for the effect to come into play and I do not expect to live with any other intelligent species in this lifetime.

16-02-19,46ir6v,[Theory] Why Saudis have no incentive to cut production... ever,"My theory is as follows:
At first, the Ay-rabs wanted to increase market share and kill competition, so they started pumping oil on all cylinders. 

However, as time went on, something unexpected happened...  Oil got to a point where it converged with  the stock market, almost perfectly.  Now all Alibaba has to do is go long on some shit, and say something along the lines of ""we are actively negotiating production cuts with Russia"" and boom stocks go up and Habib cashes out some sweet moola.  

The next day Muhammed goes short on a bunch of shit and says ""We're increasing production,"" boom stocks tank and Jaafar cashes out again.  

Abdullah realized he can make way more money playing the market than he ever could selling diarrhea water.  Hence, it makes sense for him to keep crude at this sweet spot between $40-20.

Hi all, so I have never properly introduced myself, till now..
To cut the story short though.. I started trading basically last week. Have been practicing on stock simulator's for over 2 years now.
Now back to this thread:
I have been following the CAS A.M. Castle stock for the past 2 months.
And here is the deal last Monday's closing I bought almost $8k worth of CAS stocks for $1.48 a share.
And I just sold all of my shares a couple of minutes ago for $1.93!
So yes, I bought the stock for 1.48 only to sell it for 1.93 barely a couple of days later. So I made almost $2,500 in like 3 days. Never have I ever earned this much in such a short period, more precise highest I earned was like $2000 in a month's time.. so you can imagine I am going a little nuts right now
I am going all nuts now lol, I tried renting a Ferrari for the weekend, but I am slowly finding comfort on reddit and I realised that's not the best way to spend my profit.

16-02-19,46m3t5,Trader who called for $26 oil now predicts this,"In mid-November, when crude was trading at $41 per barrel, technical analyst Todd Gordon predicted that the continuation of oil's decline would take the commodity all the way down to $26.

And that is precisely what happened. On Thursday, Feb. 11, oil traded as low as $26.05 — a level it has since bounced off of powerfully.
But before becoming convinced that $26 was indeed the bottom for crude, there is one more thing that Gordon needs to see.
Second, recent history shows that crude is capable of rallying as much as 50 percent in the midst of a larger downtrend, as it did in early 2015.
""What we need to see is a break above a 50 percent rally. Currently we're about halfway from the lows — so that points to about $38,"" he said.

This is a similar method to the one Gordon used to forecast $26.

His argument then was that history repeats — and just as oil fell 77 percent amid the financial crisis, it was doomed to drop 77 percent from its highs once again.",0

Negative interest rates was the last silver bullet the Federal Reserve had in its arsenal, after years of quantitative easing (printing money) and zero interest rate policy. Note: Japan has done it recently, so far without any benefit.

 

While the markets are not worried about it at this point (1 data point does not make a trend), it is likely any future inflation signals along with any weakening economic indicators will panic the market to the tune of a full 25-30% correction off of the all time highs on the S&amp;P 500.

Fresh, clean water cannot be taken for granted. And it is not — water is political, and litigious. Transporting water is impractical for both political and physical reasons, so buying up water rights did not make a lot of sense to me, unless I was pursuing a greater fool theory of investment — which was not my intention. What became clear to me is that food is the way to invest in water. That is, grow food in water-rich areas and transport it for sale in water-poor areas. This is the method for redistributing water that is least contentious, and ultimately it can be profitable, which will ensure that this redistribution is sustainable. A bottle of wine takes over 400 bottles of water to produce — the water embedded in food is what I found interesting.""

16-02-18,46g2o6,Question about Options Pricing,"So I understand the basics with options, Strike Price, Intrinsic Value, etc. However when I look at certain options I can't figure out the pricing on them. For example:

GOOG has a call option with a $540 strike price, Feb 26 expiration, and an ask price of $164.50. That means the contract is for $704.50 per share.

GOOG also has a call option with a $702.50 strike price, Feb 26 expiration, and an ask price of $12.70. That contract is for $715.20 per share. 

I am assuming that what happens is people are looking to short term sell the one with the strike price closer to the actual stock price and make a larger % gain on it then they would if they bought the super low strike price and just exercised the option. Is this correct? If an investor had full intention of exercising there would be no point in buying the higher strike price. Am I missing something? The expiration date is the same, and all things equal the first option is better. Just if the price of the stock swings one way or another the gain/loss % will be less.",2

16-02-19,46moc8,Managing a losing position using options(barring catastrophic failure),"Lets examine how we can use options to our benefit in managing a losing position.


When long the underlying and red, most people have a natural tendency to get longer lower in order to reduce their overall cost basis. To me, this is silly. If you are intending on getting longer lower, you should be getting paid to do so. By selling puts at your next entry target, you collect premium by allowing another user the opportunity to be short the underlying at that strike price. The market values this and pays you for providing the liquidity. You collect that and now have lowered(at worst) your true cost of ownership. If the put expires with price above your strike, you make 100% of the margin and can continue to sell puts at your intended entry point.

If you don't want to get any longer, you can instead sell calls at your intended exit from the stock anyway. Again, by selling the market pays you for providing liquidity and assuming risk. The difference in this situation between selling puts and calls, is that selling calls at a higher strike price does not affect your margin required for the trade. It's essentially a means for you to take profit/get out of the trade, but you get paid to do it.

Now, if you aren't in a position at all, but want to be long at a certain number, again i'm a believer in using options to get there. Sell puts at your intended entry, and get paid for waiting until you get put. 

I'm sure this has all been covered before, but just wanted to put it out there, because I get antsy when i trade, and since i trade futures(RIP account) i don't have the luxury of cheaply managing my risk.

......
&gt;CO Impact Days, March 3-4, is the brainchild for Stephanie Gripne, founder of the Impact Finance Center at the University of Denver's Daniels College of Business, and matchmaker between foundations, high net-worth investors and nonprofit and for profit organizations and businesses.

....
&gt;She estimates there are Colorado investors with more than $1 billion looking for investments. Her goal is to get $100 million of that in the next three years into companies, projects and funds with a social mission.

.....
&gt;Gripne believes in the idea so much that she sunk in $500,000 of her own money to host the event, hoping she gets it back in registration fees and sponsorships.
The real payoff, however, will be that 200 accredited investors get a chance to see 60 companies with a social mission. Eight companies will get a chance to make a five-minute pitch to a room of investors.
“This is the first time in the U.S. that 200 accredited impact investors will come together for a statewide marketplace, where they can connect with each other, learn, and have intimate access to social ventures representing projects, for profits, nonprofits, and funds at any stage of growth,"" Gripne said.

......

We extract trading rules in plain language, performance and risk characteristics and various descriptive characteristics (the instruments used for trading, markets traded, backtest period length etc.).

Box is a cloud storage provider. Its CEO, Aaron Levie, is wholeheartedly backing Apple. ""Companies choose to use their political capital when it is really important or relevant to them, he said, according to Reuters. ""If individually pressed you would see the same message from essentially any Internet or hardware or enterprise software CEO or company, and that's because the fundamental security model of our technology would break if you were to comply with this kind of order.""
He added: ""The whole grounds on which Apple is standing on are just super important.""

Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
The EFF is a civil-liberties advocacy group. Predictably, it is supporting Apple on this one. In a blog post, EFF's deputy executive director, Kurt Opsahl, explained why:
We are supporting Apple here because the government is doing more than simply asking for Apple's assistance. For the first time, the government is requesting Apple write brand new code that eliminates key features of iPhone security—security features that protect us all. Essentially, the government is asking Apple to create a master key so that it can open a single phone. And once that master key is created, we're certain that our government will ask for it again and again, for other phones, and turn this power against any software or device that has the audacity to offer strong security.

Facebook
In a statement released Thursday, Facebook expressed support for Apple. ""We condemn terrorism and have total solidarity with victims of terror. Those who seek to praise, promote, or plan terrorist acts have no place on our services,"" it said (via The Guardian.)
""However, we will continue to fight aggressively against requirements for companies to weaken the security of their systems. These demands would create a chilling precedent and obstruct companies’ efforts to secure their products.""
The social network is a member of industry body Reform Government Surveillance, which has released a statement that is below.

Google
Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, has spoken out on Twitter in support of Apple.
""Forcing companies to enable hacking could compromise users' privacy,"" he wrote.
He continued:
We know that law enforcement and intelligence agencies face significant challenges in protecting the public against crime and terrorism. We build secure products to keep your information safe and we give law enforcement access to data based on valid legal orders. But that's wholly different than requiring companies to enable hacking of customer devices &amp; data. Could be a troubling precedent.

Twitter
""We stand with @Tim_Cook and Apple (and thank him for his leadership!)"" Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted on Thursday, linking to Cook's open letter.
A company representative also previously directed Business Insider towards Twitter's previous support for Save Crypto, a petition to the White House arguing against any weakening of encryption, and towards Twitter's joint submission to Britain's proposed new spying law, the Investigatory Powers Bill.
It reads: ""We reject any proposals that would require companies to deliberately weaken the security of their products via backdoors, forced decryption, or any other means.""

Anyway, I was browsing The S&amp;P looking at oil companies and the majority of them have been dropping for a while now and it is hard to know if they have hit bottom. I use http://www.cnbc.com/us-market-movers/ to see big movers for the S&amp;P and Dow and it is really helpful. Today tons of oil companies have the largest losses. I was browsing them and found Valero Energy (VLO) I looked at the past 5 years and they are unlike any oil company I've ever seen and honestly it looks good. I was really surprised and am wondering what other people think. I may buy today and I'm willing to accept a large degree of risk.

16-02-20,46nx3f,"Acquiring international exposure: average in with ETF, transfer to fund?","The only international exposure I have in my portfolio comes from my target date retirement fund (VFIFX) having 36% total international stocks and 3.1% total international bonds. Thus I have about 4.5% of my portfolio indirectly allocated to Vanguard Total International Stock Market (VGTSX). My remaining portfolio is 50.5% domestic stocks, 21% bonds, and 24% money market.

I just started investing around December and have been slow to enter positions. Im working towards about a 70/30 stock/bond allocation and I think I should perhaps up my total international assets to around 10-15% (~10% stock ~5 bond).

Right now is obviously not a good time to plunge into the international market. So Im thinking about slowly buying in with VWO and/or VXUS over the next several months since I could average my cost without incurring any commission fees and set limits to try and capture the lowest prices in a sliding market. Once the asset value is high enough, I would transfer from the ETF to the fund version to minimize the expense ratio.

Intuitively, this seems like a good approach to me, but like I said, Im fairly new to investing and wanted to get input from you guys.

16-02-18,46h2kt,"Why invest in ""growth"" stocks/ stocks with no dividend?","What's the purpose of investing in stocks that don't pay a dividend?

I understand that the company can use the profits to help grow, but the only way you make money is if someone buys the stock from you at a higher price. In which case, they will only make money by doing the same thing.

Do companies that offer no dividends promise to offer dividends in the future, or how are the stocks really worth even a penny?

&amp;nbsp;


Update:
Thank you to everyone who responded, there was a lot of good information posted.

I guess what led me to ask this question was that I was always taught to keep emotion out of investing, and stocks that don't pay dividends require others to purchase your position for some emotional reason if you want to realize any profit. Growth stocks seems to be very volatile, which I guess would make them great for trading. But for buying and holding, it's more of a guessing game on how long the growth will continue.

I have DRIP's in KO and CRH plc, the reason I like those shares is because I still have tax benefits which help me compound my earning potential, and I accumulate more of the assets while maintaining a mostly stable share price.

I ask because if there are no real restrictions, couldn't you use non-standard bases to skirt around some gambling laws?

Like say I issue a bunch of small loans whose interest rates are determined by a sports team's performance. Then, you have a futures market where you are trading these interest rates, longing and shorting depending on whether you think the team will win or lose.

“I continue to monitor developments, but until I see further evidence to the contrary, my current expectation is that the U.S. economy will work through this episode of market turbulence and the soft patch of economic data to regain its footing for moderate growth, even as the energy and manufacturing sectors remain challenged,” Mester said in a speech to a meeting of the Global Interdepedence Center in Sarasota, Fla.

A more persistent drop in equity markets could spillover into the broader economy, “but so far we have not seen this,” Mester said.


January’s retail sales report suggests that consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of output, started the year on “a strong note,” Mester said. Consumer lending is also rising, an indication that Americans feel pretty positive about the outlook.

Just looking for feedback on something I see a lot when reading about picking a stock.  A lot of authors/posters put a lot of emphasis on conducting your own first hand evaluation of a company's financials to determine their fundamental strengths.   

I am having a hard time seeing the value in this.

16-02-20,46qokl,How to [and not to] ask questions / advice,"It seems this sub-reddit has a daily issue. It's fine to seek advice, but we see far too many posts that are not seeking advice at all, but simply want to be told where said person should put their money. This is not okay.  
  
Let me reiterate; This is not okay.  
  
I'm going to make a list of examples on what you ( people seeking advice ) SHOULD ask and what you shouldn't.  
  
**How NOT to ask for advice**  
- ""I am interested in the stock market. I know to buy low sell high. Can anyone suggest stocks for me to invest in?""  
- "" Recently decided to learn about investing. Can anyone point me in the right direction?""  
- ""Is it a good time to buy?""  
- ""Beginner wondering what all the terms mean""  
- ""The market is going down, should I sell all of my positions?!?""  
  
**Why the above is wrong**  
Never ask anyone where to put your money.( Less maybe your accountant or full-service broker if applicable). Especially don't ask strangers over the internet what you should do with your money. Do your Due Diligence.  
  
If you really were interested in learning about the stock market, you wouldn't post here and do nothing else. First of all you are not guaranteed a reply, and if you do get one, it could take hours or days. Just looking up the information yourself is a far better approach and really shows commitment and that you're serious.  
  
If you think it's a good time to buy, explain to us why you think that. Don't just ask us if it's a good time to buy, let's create a discussion.  
  
Don't know the terms? Look them up. Seriously, you'll get great answers ( and once again, likely much faster then waiting for replies all day ) if you just went to sites like investopedia, and then came to us with more specific questions.  
  
Lastly, if you think the market is going down even more so, don't just ask us if you should sell. Give us more details. MORE DETAILS. What's your avg? How long have you held? Etc.  
  
  
**How to ask for advice properly**  
  
- ""I have been interested in learning the stock market for awhile. I've done a lot of my own research but I don't understand how things like P/E, EBITA, etc, effect a stock price?""  
- "" I'm looking at 'x' stock. I think it's a good buy because of ""y and z"". What do you guys think?""  
  
- "" Beginner here. I'm trying to get the hang of technical analysis but I'm having trouble understanding what support and resistance is. Can someone please help me understand better?""  
  
- "" I currently have ""x"" and ""y"" company in my portfolio. I'm looking to add a company that has high dividends. Can anyone suggest some companies I can look at and do my due diligence to, to see if it's a fit?""  
  
Can you see the difference? All too often people come here looking to literally be spoon-fed answers on what to do. This won't help you make money on the stock market. If anything it's just going to hinder you. Beginners need to learn how to find information on their own, and then come here to ask us more specific questions. The other key difference in the DON'T and DO's is that the DO questions were , once again, specific. It shows you have taken your own time and done research, but still had trouble understanding some concepts. By all means, come post questions here if that's the case, and we'd all be more then happy to do our best to assist. However, if you come here and just straight up ask us what to do , and do literally no work on your own, that's the wrong road to be going down. ",15

16-02-20,46qw56,Trading options for noobs,"Easiest way I have learnt trading options is with the following steps:

1. Pick a stock with liquid options- For indexes SPY, IWM, QQQ and in general stock price &gt;50. 

2. Pick a direction- Long or short. 

3. Look at the IV rank- Volatility will help you decide strategy. If it's greater than 50% then sell options and vice versa. 

4. Risk assessment- this matters with more complex strategies, naked calls and puts are more risk but more reward and iron condors are less risk and less reward. Pick your poison. 

5. Picking a strike- If you are starting with trading options easiest way is to pick the strike 1sd away for indexes and 1.5sd away for stocks. The way to figure out 1sd strike is to add the ATM put and call price.  Then add/subtract that to the current price of the stock. That's your 1sd strikes. Why?  Because atm call and puts are 0.5 delta each. 

6. Managing winners- take profits in spreads at 50% max profit and condors with 75% max. You are taking more risk after you hit 50% profit. Your money would be better used in a new position. 

7. Managing losers- You have to ask yourself whether you still believe in the position or not. If you do then you roll the spread out. If you don't close it and take the loss.

16-02-20,46opj9,SPY - Writing Deep OTM Puts - Why is this a bad idea?,"Hey folks,

I'm new to trading options so I'm sorry if this is a dumb question. 

I have around $50,000 in cash that I'm looking to invest in the near future. That $50,000 was previously in SPY but I pulled everything a couple months ago based on market volatility and changing investor sentiment (and thankfully got out before the fall). 

Ideally I'd like to hold my money out of the stock market until things either bottom out or at least settle down more. My question to you guys is why would it be a bad idea to write a deep OTM put on the SPY with a strike of say 160 and an expiration of early 2017? The way I see it, if I was holding my money in cash I would likely enter the market at that strike anyway in a bargain-hunting effort. 

Since options are really a zero-sum game, I feel like I'm missing something obvious. Surely I couldn't get paid a premium to do what I'm assuming most people would do anyway (throw money into the bottoming market).

I see the obvious risk that SPY drops lower than my strike, but if my time horizon is 2-3 years, wouldn't I be fairly assured of a rebound past 160 by then? 

Edit: 160 is arbitrary - you can replace that with any deep OTM strike price. ",6

16-02-20,46r6xr,"BARRON'S: What Recession? GDP Set to Grow 3%","&gt; To begin with, while a 3% increase in gross domestic product might sound unduly ambitious, this reflects only the lowered ambitions of the current era. Every expansion since World War II has gone through intervals of slow growth. However, all have had years in which economic growth ran at 4% or better, including the 2002-07 expansion. If the economy rises by 3% this year, the current expansion will still retain the dubious honor of being the weakest on record (see chart above).

&gt; Growth of 4% seems unattainable due to the drag on exports from weak economies abroad, combined with a strong dollar that makes those exports more costly, plus below-par performance of the small-business sector and slowed expansion of the labor force, owing mainly to the retirement of baby boomers. But if the vicious cycle of recession is avoided, a virtuous cycle should ensue, as positive factors reinforce one another. 

&gt; Employment gains and the tight labor market are already driving up wages and salaries. That is boosting consumer spending, which is encouraging capital investment, which is causing businesses to hire, which, in turn, is driving employment gains. The virtuous cycle has also begun to include the housing sector. Employment gains make it possible for more people to form households, which spurs demand for apartment buildings and detached homes, which, in turn, leads to greater gains in employment.

&gt; With faster top-line growth, corporate profits can also rise. Profit increases typically slow long before an economic expansion runs out of steam. The pace of the bull market of the past few years has probably slowed, but stock prices can still reach new highs.

&gt; IF RECESSION IS AROUND the corner, it will turn history on its head. Take the impact of oil since the mid-1970s. As the chart below shows, each of the past six recessions has been preceded by a spike in crude prices, often called an “oil shock.” The logic is straightforward: Businesses and consumers suffer financial shock when this essential commodity suddenly becomes more costly.

&gt; The current collapse in petroleum prices has also been called an oil shock, even though plunging tabs for such items as gasoline, heating oil, diesel fuel, and jet fuel have enriched those same businesses and consumers. 

&gt; Of course, cheaper crude does hurt energy producers. But since most publicly traded companies are consumers of energy, it makes no sense for the broad stock indexes to track oil. The recent pattern in which the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index moves up and down in concert with crude seems to reflect equity traders’ belief that a low price for crude signals an economic slowdown. 

&gt; Hopefully, the market will soon break out of this circular-reasoning trap. If Barron’s is right that oil will rise to $55 a barrel by December, this pattern will be broken by events. Our Feb. 6 cover story, “Here Comes $20 Oil,” referred to the likely final leg of the energy bear market, which should end by April, before a rebound to $55 by December.

&gt; Defaults by the energy sector on loans are hurting U.S. banks. But according to estimates by economist Carsten Valgreen of Applied Global Macro Research, such loans account for no more than 4% of the banks’ total loan book. So even if losses on these loans run as high as one-half, this should hardly trigger a banking crisis.

&gt; As Valgreen also points out, in all three categories of bank lending—commercial and industrial, consumer, and residential real estate—conventionally calculated loss ratios are near historic lows. “Bank lending has been gathering steam,” observes Rennaissance Macro Research economics head Neil Dutta, noting that over the 13 weeks through Feb. 3, commercial bank lending accelerated across all categories. Valgreen, who helps run a hedge fund that trades on such insights, believes that the recent selloff in U.S. banking stocks offers a unique buying opportunity.

&gt; Another channel through which low energy prices supposedly threaten recession: weakness in developing lands that export oil. Making matters worse is slower economic expansion in China, Japan, and the euro zone. 

&gt; But while U.S. growth will certainly take a hit from lower exports to the global market, Michael Lewis, economics chief at Free Market, observes, “In the modern era, there is not a single recession that can be traced to foreign economic woes.” 

&gt; For example, the 1998 meltdown in the Asian economies that caused a brief selloff in the U.S. stock market didn’t trigger the recession that many expected at the time. Adds Lewis: “While a U.S. sneeze can give the rest of the world the proverbial flu, the reverse still does not happen.”

&gt; To be sure, the ultralow interest rates maintained by the Federal Reserve have created a breeding ground for financial excesses that, when painfully corrected, often bring recession. But so far, it appears that the Fed and the economy have been lucky. Major excesses are hard to find.

&gt; Even if stocks make new highs by the end of the year, standard price/earnings ratios will be noticeably below their peak of 2000, especially if earnings make modest gains. And the home-price bubble that started to burst in 2007 is a long way from forming again. The classic excess cited in the textbooks—the excessive buildup of inventories—is hardly present today, especially in light of the cuts to inventory investment in the second half of last year.

&gt; ONE INDICATION that the economy has found renewed strength: the labor force turnaround of prime-age workers 25 to 54. Much of the reason for slowed growth in the labor force has been demographic. The baby boomers are reaching retirement age, and they are merely following a predictable life cycle by leaving the workplace. But as Barron’s has pointed out (“Work’s for Squares,” Aug. 30, 2014), another, far more disconcerting trend was also evident: lower participation by prime-age workers.

&gt; This unanticipated trend is a key reason that forecasters have been surprised by how far the unemployment rate has fallen, despite modest growth. Skeptics have therefore dismissed the decline as bogus. Why place any value on a statistic that becomes more favorable as job seekers stop seeking jobs? But that is no longer true of prime-age workers, and the turnaround is due to the full-employment economy signaled by the jobless rate’s decline to 4.9%.

&gt; The prime-age labor force fell to a low of 100.6 million in second-quarter 2014 from its fourth-quarter 2007 peak of 104.4 million. Over the past six calendar quarters, however, it has rebounded by 1.3 million, to 101.9 million in January. The unemployment rate’s decline over this period, to 4.9% from 6.2%, has therefore been accompanied by more prime-age job-seekers rejoining the workforce.

&gt; THE RECENT TREND in the unemployment rate also tells us something about the diminished chances of recession. Evidence shows that increases in joblessness consistently lead economic turndowns. In the 12 months before all 11 recessions since World War II, the jobless rate rose on a three-month basis at least once, and usually several times, no doubt because it started to feel the tremors from reduced economic activity before the recession hit.

&gt; In the 12 months prior to the 2008-09 recession, the unemployment rate rose on a three-month basis no fewer than seven times. Before the previous recession, of 2001, it climbed five times, and before the 1990-91 recession, six times.

&gt;But over the past 12 months—in fact, over the past three years—the three-month change in the unemployment rate has generally been negative and occasionally flat; it hasn’t risen even once. The last three-month increase in joblessness occurred as of January 2013, when it hit 8%.

&gt; Further confirming the positive trend in the labor markets: the persistent decline in new claims for unemployment insurance. As Free Market’s Lewis points out, initial claims are “one of the most reliable leading indicators, typically giving ample warning of recessions.” But, he adds, there is “not even an inkling [of a rise] yet.” In the four weeks through Feb. 13, weekly claims averaged 273,000, one of the lowest figures in decades.

&gt; For real GDP to grow by 3% this year, real consumer spending must do its part, rising at an annualized 3% or more in each calendar quarter. So far, at least, consumption seems to be off to a good start. Based on the solid retail sales report for January, economist Neil Dutta is tracking 3.2% growth in the current quarter. If that persists, it will be noticeably higher than the lackluster performance of 2015, when real consumption for the full year rose by just 2.6%. Last year, the money generated by the boost to disposable personal income was mainly saved, rather than spent.

&gt; Applied Global Macro Research economist Jason Benderly predicts that consumption will rise by 3.4% this year. His forecast seems plausible if, as he expects, three factors that figured in 2015’s weak performance recede this year. 

&gt; The first factor, which weighed on consumer spending, was a fall in confidence. Benderly has found the best indicator of consumer confidence isn’t the standard surveys of confidence, but rather credit spreads. The spread between yields on Baa corporate bonds and 10-year Treasuries widened steadily over the course of last year and is now even wider. But as recession fears recede, this spread should start narrowing. That should signal a rise in confidence, he argues, accompanied by a rise in spending.

&gt; The second factor is, ironically, faster growth of wages and salaries. Benderly has found that consumer spending responds with a lag when wage-and-salary growth accelerates. That happened last year, with the extra income going into extra saving. This year, however, consumer spending should start to catch up with the increase in income.

&gt; THE FINAL FACTOR is also a lagged response, in this case, to lower energy prices. Benderly has found that when prices of necessities decline, consumers initially save much of the windfall, only to spend it later. So last year’s plunging energy costs went into savings, but much of it will be spent on consumption this year.

&gt; Another key component of economic output—investment in plant and equipment— was hurt by the severe cutbacks by the energy sector. But if the oil price rebounds to $55, as Barron’s expects, then key parts of energy investment will make a comeback before the year is out, says Citigroup senior energy analyst Anthony Yuen. And in general, Benderly anticipates a gradual rebound in U.S. manufacturing, as it responds with a normal lag to the pickup in retail sales.

&gt; The government portion of output, which began to make small contributions to growth in 2015, should pick up a bit this year, too, given the turnaround in state and local employment. 

&gt; Residential investment, which has been making steady contributions to GDP growth, should also climb a bit faster, as rising incomes spur greater household formation, in turn causing greater production and spurring greater employment and formation of households.  In short, the virtuous cycle should dominate. 

SOUNDS LIKE ITS TIME TO DUMP ALL THOSE BOND FUNDS AND GO 150% LONG EQUITIES!!!! I mean, there's no way BARRON'S editorials would be a poor forecasting cue, right? RIGHT?

I was pretty worried about $36 just being charged to me for a thing I had no idea about but I put in on me as my mistake for choosing a bad company. Now i plan to just have my money deposited there and not touch it until I have a greater sum that I can invest with. But I also dont want to get charged that reorganization fee on the two different companies I have stocks with even though one of them is almost close to zero. I need advice: should I now sell the stocks so I can avoid getting charged this extra money or should I just let them sit there until they reach zero value? I have no idea what to do. Can anyone help me?",1

The last few months I’ve been reading a lot about options and investing. I try to save as many links as I can when learning about something, so I thought I would put together a list of sources that have helped me ""understand"" all this craziness. I’m still very much a noob! Just thought this could help those that are also learning. This community is a lot of fun to follow, and I've learnt a lot from all of you.

This doesn’t go over the basics of options



* What Works on Wall Street - O’Shaughnessy
[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/What-Works-Street-Fourth-Edition/dp/0071625763)

This isn’t about options, but I was thinking the trending value stock screen can be used for options? Stocks can be screened using matlab to get O’Shaughnessy top 25.

16-02-20,46rrzz,Wall Street Analyst : Hillary Clinton would be the best president for healthcare investors,"In a report titled “Healthcare: Our 2016 Outlook,” S&amp;P Capital’s IQ Healthcare Equity Research’s Jeffrey Loo writes that Clinton should be the preferred choice for the industry in order to maintain high profits. She will preserve the Affordable Care Act and be unable to pass meaningful drug reform legislation

The report makes clear that it views the gridlock created by a Clinton administration paired with a GOP Congress as the rosiest picture healthcare investors.

&gt;Overall, we believe the best scenario for healthcare investors is a Democrat, presumably Hillary Clinton, winning the Presidency, as we anticipate the Republicans retaining control of Congress. In this scenario, in spite of Clinton’s numerous “threats” to rein in drug prices, allowing the re-importation of drugs, and allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, we believe it is highly unlikely Clinton will be able to pass these initiatives through a Republican controlled Congress. Conversely, the Republicans’ efforts to repeal Healthcare Reform, would be thwarted by a Clinton veto as we do not anticipate the Republican obtaining the 2/3 votes to override a veto.

Q1. For cross-listed companies are the same shares being traded (bought and sold) in each market? 

For example:
Anglo American is listed on the LSE and JSE (London and Johannesburg). 
There are 1.289 billion outstanding shares.
Am I right in thinking that some of those 1.289 billion shares are on the LSE and some are on the JSE? Or are all 1.289 billion shares on both exchanges? 

Q2. Is the share price of a cross-listed company in one country generally equal to whatever it is in the other country, adjusted for the exchange rate (I'm not asking whether market efficiency holds, but I guess more whether there is the same number of shares for the listed company in each market)

For example: Richemont is listed in Switzerland and has depository receipts in South Africa on the JSE. 
10 DRs equal one A share. 
Is this an unusual relationship (is it usually one for one)?

As I'm sure you can tell, I'm well past the point of confusion.

16-02-21,46w41i,DD: $CMRX,"Edit: 9 reasons to now buy CMRX, after a 40% crash based purely on panic and incorrect information:


1) As of the end of Q3 2015, the company had 378m in cash or cash-equivalent assets -- that is $8.20. Total assets equaled $391.5m.

2) With closure of two trials begun just a few months ago, cash burn now greatly reduced.

3) BARDA smallpox contract that can net up to 435 million over 5 years. Currently the contract is worth 100 million dollars for 60 months.

4) The drug works to prevent CMV infections, and with 92% confidence works against BK virus infections -- see page 38 of the Feb 22 slides.

5) There is no extreme diarrhea toxicity under lower doses: the P3 overall diarrhea incidence level is actually significantly smaller, on a per-week basis, than the P2 diarrhea incidence level. The amount of diarrhea is greatly reduced under the P3 versus the P2 when the patient is treated under the safety monitoring and management plan (SMMP).

6) The FDA will likely approve the drug for a subset of the population that had no confusion with GVHD versus diarrhea -- T-cell depleted transplant patients and higher-risk patients. There is no reason not to approve the drug.

7) In event of a sale, the company, as of the end of Q3 2015 has 301.6m in retained earning tax write-offs for the acquirer.

8) The earnings report and CC will clarify the path forward, which in my opinion is likely an NDA for a subset of the population, or a sale of the company/assets.

9) An open-label Phase III ADVISE adenovirus trial update is due during the CC/ER next Tuesday!

*An open-label phase III trial called ADVISE is under way for the treatment of adenovirus infection in pediatric and adult patients. CEO Berrey declined to provide updates on ADVISE during the call, saying that more is coming soon as part of Chimerix's earnings report. She reminded investors that ""we have the cash to enable us to carry forward these studies, as well as the patent runway through 2034.""*

----------------------------

CMRX presented detailed results today of brincidofovir, an antiviral drug, in its ability to stop CMV infections for recipients of stem cell transplants. This market according to an SA writer (http://seekingalpha.com/article/3813506-trading-near-cash-chimerix-upside) is $600m yearly.

[Link to presentation here](http://ir.chimerix.com/common/download/download.cfm?companyid=AMDA-1QNA05&amp;fileid=876238&amp;filekey=E6BF3107-8B16-487D-B5A7-ED4A905C54E6&amp;filename=Chimerix_BMT_Tandem_Meeting_Presentation_February_2016.pdf).

CMRX on Dec. 28 reported a failure of its primary endpoint, causing the stock to crash from $35 to $6. Friday, it was trading at $7.63 at the close. I should know because I bought a massive position.

The detailed results confirmed management's hypothesis in spades. Trial design, especially suspected GVHD protocol (and especially docs not following the protocol, administering corticosteroids even more wildly than called for), was to blame for missing the primary endpoint.

Management's hypothesis, based on preliminary analysis, is that diarrhea, as the main side effect of the drug (esp. since unlike p2, in p3 it was administered right after transplant), was confused with GVHD, or graft-versus-host disease. This led to large amounts of corticosteroid use which led to a drastically weakened immune system and more infections than would have occurred. (I personally understand this because I used corticosteroids for my skin and got infections many times)

Corticosteroid use was 8x that of placebo. Even with that, at week 14 (trial was 14 weeks on 10 weeks off), brinci reduced CMV infections by at least ~40%.

Management highlighted several subgroups, including subgroups that did not have T-cells in their transplants (no Gvhd) showing drug was effective in those subgroups without further analysis.

Importantly, company has IV formulation which will essentially bypass the diarrhea problems.

Company did cancel other P3 paused trials, but they were only getting started and they will turn into P2s essentially, I believe. I suspect management will rework protocol for those other indications in light of the diarrhea confusion with GVHD aspect.

There are no competitors in this space (CMV reactivation prevention in hematopoietic stem cells transplantation [HSCT] recipients). One potential competitor has extremely serious and multiple side effects, and their data isn't due until 2017.

Company is $20m below book. Drug was valued at less than 0. I see a huge move Monday.

Retirement [2035](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundIntExt=INT&amp;FundId=0305) (roughly 20 years away) is the farthest one that breaks this pattern, getting closer to ~20%.

Assuming a retirement age of 65, investors in the 2035 fund would be around 45, investors in the 2040 fund would be 40, etc.  Vanguard's timeline for reallocating more strongly into bonds breaks with both the ""Age in bonds"" and the more aggressive ""Age - 20 in bonds"" rules of thumb I've heard about.  What's the thinking here to waiting longer before moving into bonds?  Do these funds stay heavy-equities for too long?

In terms of my own desired allocation timeline, I understand I can pick whatever 20XX fund is best regardless of expected retirement date, and I can invest/rebalance on my own.  I'm curious about the thinking behind the funds' apparent allocation timelines.",9

16-02-22,470a9j,DD: Lara Exploration (LRA.V),"**Lara Exploration** (numbers in CAD)
LRA.V - trades on the venture exchange
Price: $0.375 MC: $11.7MM EV: $10.6MM Cash: $1.1MM 

**Investment thesis:** Shortage of Stock. Insider buying. Going concern. Nice resource portfolio. Management. PDAC bump. 

**Price Target:** $1.30 

**Summary:** Project generator based exclusively in South America, turning into a royalty company. Same core guys that made the Cukaru Peki discovery with Reservoir Minerals - world class discovery in Serbia (65 mt at 3.5% CuEq). Optionality on copper/gold without the downside of insolvency or delist that most junior mining pubcos are looking at on TSXV. 

Consistent insider buying that started in July and lasted into the end of January by the Chairman of the Board, Miles Thompson, and the Vice President Corporate Development, Christopher MacIntyre. Together, they have picked up $166,000 of Lara stock, with Miles Thompson making the lions share of purchases. Average insider purchase price: $0.27. 

Lara operates a ‘prospect generator’ model for exploration. Prospect generators identify areas of interest, and as opposed to raising money from investors for the expensive development work they instead partner with established mining companies that have deep pockets to fund the expensive exploration phases. Comps on this model: Altius, Reservoir, Mirasol, Virginia (acquired)

Quite simply, the objective is to reduce dilution to shareholders by diluting at the project level as opposed to the corporate level. Lara has a number of partners, most notably CODELCO, which is the state owned mine development company in Chile. 

The Liberdade project is copper, nice grades 0.7% from surface. This project will be a mine one day. Road access. One landowner. 
Partner, CODELCO is committed to expanding copper reserves. Engineering expertise through partner. Partner will fund exploration. 

PDAC - largest mining conference on planet - is two weeks from this past Saturday. Top end upside is an acquisition, far more likely is the seasonality bump related to publicity of event. 

**TL;DR** sexy jr resource pubco. trading at ~$10MM EV. Liberdade is worth $1 per share on its own in a shit commodity market. Shortage of stock will run it, especially if we continue the seasonality bump in precious metals.",4

The bank, which last week said it would keep its headquarters in London, said its fourth-quarter loss was US$1.33 billion, compared with a year-earlier profit of $511 million, dragged down by bad loans in North America and losses from hedging, according to a spokesman for the bank.

The bank also said it is the subject of an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission into its hiring practices. HSBC said the SEC is examining its hiring of candidates ""referred by or related to government officials or employees of state-owned enterprises"" in the Asia-Pacific region.

16-02-22,470sn6,Building a job out of investing?,"Hello everyone.

I've been reading several recommended blogs/websites/journals about several forms of investing, and I must say I never thought there were so many different ways. 

Now, I've seen that a lot of people do this as an additional form of income, but what I'd like to know, is if it's possible to start doing this as a job, having it as your main source of income.

I have around 3500£ in the bank and I currently don't have a job. I usually work in greenhouses, so it's a seasonal job, and once the sun goes away, there's too little to do. I'm 23, and I've always wanted to have my own things and not having someone to boss me around, but since I'm from Portugal, I must say that finding a job in there is pretty much impossible (they always want someone with 12 years of school, under 25, 5+ years of experience and pretty), and that's why I came to the UK 3 years ago.

So, I'd like to ask, where do you recommend that I start? I've started reading Benjamin Graham, but I think it's too hard to start, at least for someone that knows nothing about this. The faster I can start having this as a job, the better. Since I live with my parents, the minimum I would need to make would be around 350£ per month (rent, bills and food), and I would study harder to raise that money along time. 

Also, I thought about day trading, but apparently the transaction costs would eat my money. I'm really determined and tired of being dependent of the agency I work for, but I also don't want to just go out there spending like crazy, not knowing what to do.

And since I'm here, I have a stupid question. I have my money in £, so how do I do it? Do I just deposit it in the website where I'll do my buying/selling and it is converted to US$, and when I widraw the reverse would happen?

Thank you all in advance.


TL;DR: How do I make this into my daily job and where to start?

I think additions to the current moderating bots might be a potential answer to these complaints without discouraging new people from contributing and learning. This is just brainstorming so if you have your own solutions or comments on what I have suggested, please contribute. 

My ideas:  

- if a new post's subject contains the word ""should"" AND ""I"", then bot replies with a link to the Daily Advice thread and then locks the thread  
- if a new post's subject has a question mark or the word ""question"", then bot replies directing them to search prior posts and the FAQ for an answer and then encourages them to post in the Daily Advice thread if their question is not resolved   

This not only helps the mods with [enforcement of our current rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2tfb4l/big_rule_change_all_questions_asking_for_advice/), but also concentrates these questions in one place so we can increase the odds of new visitors seeing credible advice and avoids the blind leading the blind situations like what u/hydrocyanide and u/MasterCookSwag have [mentioned before](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3zvfff/meta_can_we_curb_the_amateur_hour_advice_on_how/cypcamz).

16-02-22,471bhb,Passive investing,"So, just a little background: 
I'm 20 years old, working full time 3rd shift, go to college full time, and I already live on my own. My parents are extremely poor(and just terrible with money all around), lazy, and just generally unmotivated people content with staying how they are and blaiming other people for their problems. I wouldn't say I resent them, but I do have a general distaste for how they live their lives. If I am to thank them for anything though, it's that seeing the state they are living in has gave me the drive and determination to make sure I don't end up like them, and to be successful.
I understand the importance of investing instead of letting it sit in a savings account, and I'd like investing to help on my goal of being ""successful"" (at least in the wealth part), Ive read multiple books etc on investing , but tbh the whole investing scene itself is just not something I'm passionate enough about to really fully go into (my passion lies in computer science). But seeing as how I know the importance of it I want to at least do something about it.

The background may have been more than necessary but oh well. Anyway, will just investing in multiple index funds  like the VFINX, VTSMX, some bonds etc be good enough or am I going to be forced to allocate more time into learning about individual investing? ( I know a decent amount, but not enough to be confident to attempt it on my own). I'm aware that I am not going to be the next Warren buffet just from investing in funds, but will they still help me out a lot in the long run?

Capital expenditure on global oil exploration and production is expected to fall 17% in 2016, following a 24% drop in 2015, according to the International Energy Agency's medium term outlook.
""It is easy for consumers to be lulled into complacency by ample stocks and low prices today, but they should heed the writing on the wall: the historic investment cuts we are seeing raise the odds of unpleasant oil-security surprises in the not too distant future,"" said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol on Monday.
Oil prices plunged more than 70% over the past 18 months but have steadied in recent days. U.S. oil futures climbed 5.7% on Monday to trade above $33 per barrel.
Freed from nuclear sanctions, Iran is expected to keep boosting production in the next five years, according to the agency's forecasts. The IEA sees Iran's output hitting 3.94 million barrels a day by 2021. The country pumped just under 3 million barrels a day in January.
As for demand, markets will continue to pivot towards Asia, the report said. Indian consumption is expected to grow in the next five years, as more motorists take to the roads. Meanwhile, Chinese demand growth will cool in tandem with the economy, the agency forecasts.

""Baker Hughes shareholders will receive $19 a share in cash and the remainder of the consideration in stock at fixed exchange ratio of 1.12 Halliburton shares, giving them 36% of the stock in the combined company.""

By my understanding, it's more like $20.59 billion now. I'm wanting to either invest in HAL or BHI but trying to decide, counting on the merger taking place, which stock would benefit the most from the trade.

How long would it take for the conversion of shares and cash payout take? I think buying BHI now before the merger is a good deal but I assume the news would have a large impact on both of their stock prices. It matters because of the stock ratio 1:1.12. For example, BHI stock goes down after the announcement and then gets converted to HAL which would be a worse deal or if the merger was approved, HAL goes up and then the trade occurs. I think I got that right but mainly I'm concerned about the timing of it. 

Buying a share of BHI now ($42.14) would get you $19 cash and .83 shares of HAL ($25.91) = $44.91",2

An OPEC production cut does not appear close at hand, but the cartel is seemingly eager to participate in an effort to bring up oil prices.

Non-OPEC Russia and Saudi Arabia agreed with Venezuela and Qatar to cut production, if other producers join in.
El-Badri made the comment as he left a panel discussion he was participating in at the IHS CERAWeek energy conference in Houston. To the gathering he said, ""Let's freeze production and if successful, take other steps in the future."" El-Badri said the proposed freeze should be evaluated after three to four months to see if it succeeds.

16-02-22,471q4d,Is the foreign income tax credit better in the long term than tax risk diversity?,"For optimum tax efficiency across taxable and tax-advantaged accounts, one common recommendation is to put all foreign equities into the taxable account.  The reason for this is that the investor can then take full advantage of the foreign tax credit to reduce their own tax bill.

However, doesn't this increase the tax risk of the entire portfolio?  All of the foreign assets are in the taxable account, and the tax-advantaged accounts have only US equities.  If you want to, say, retire early off of the assets in the taxable account, then you have to hope that your foreign equities are not in a downturn.  That's just an example; there are probably lots of scenarios in which the effective drop or gain of the asset class is affected by its tax status.  Also, tax laws could change in the future...

On the other end of the spectrum is having the same ratio of US/Foreign equities in each of the accounts.  The foreign equities in the taxable account could get the tax credit, but the ones in tax-advantaged accounts could not.  The advantage here is that any downswings in either foreign or US would affect all accounts approximately equally, so the investor can select the best account for their own tax situation at the time based on its tax status.

Is there a clear advantage in one case or the other that I'm missing?  Is the foreign tax credit only significant enough to matter for absolute portfolio optimization?  Am I making a mountain out of a molehill?",3

I have a feeling I'm misunderstanding some part of this. It can't really be this easy...is it?",0

GoPro's biggest problem? Whenever everyone has their GoPro, they have no reason to buy another one. Unless it can launch a new product - it can't - it's simply doomed. And don't tell me people upgrade their cameras: in 95%+ of cases, they don't for many many years.

According to a report from the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute (SWFI), SWFs — investors with more than *$7 trillion at work around the world who invest on behalf of governments — aren't going to keep all their money in this choppy market for much longer.
From the report (emphasis added):
If oil prices remain in the US$ 30 to US$ 40 per barrel range, we predict a withdrawal of US$ 404.3 billion ... from global listed equities, about twice the amount that left in 2015. We take into effect past behavior, government structure, the need for capital to lessen fiscal gaps and reporting lag times. Part of the estimate includes a prediction on how well assets will perform in 2016.
SWF equity holdings could fall to $2.64 trillion this year, the report goes on to say. That's down from about $3.04 trillion at the end of 2015.

I guess the question is,...structurally or safety-wise,...is there an advantage to directly owning shares of individual companies that comprise an ETF vs. simply purchasing the ETF itself?

Is it ""better"" to own shares directly vs. owning them by proxy via a gateway such as an ETF? If so, what are the advantages? Any disadvantages?

I ask this because brokers like Folio Investing make it easy and cost effective to hold portfolios of like 50 - 100 individual stocks and manage them effortlessly.

Fitbit reported its fourth-quarter earnings rose to $64.2 million, or 26 cents a share, from $39.2 million, or 19 cents a share, a year ago. On an adjusted basis, the San Francisco company would have earned 35 cents a share. Revenue nearly doubled to $711.6 million from $370.2 million.

Fitbit expects first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of break even to 2 cents in the current quarter and $1.08 to $1.20 for 2016. Analysts are projecting first-quarter EPS of 23 cents and full year EPS of $2.15. Fitbit also forecast first-quarter revenue in a range of $420 million to $440 million and $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion for the full year, compared with the Street's estimate of $484 million in the first quarter and $9.36 billion for 2016.

16-02-23,477fov,Four different ways of interpreting the gold price and why you should be a long-term bull,"A. If you want to know if gold beats US CPI (America’s version of the inflation index) covers the cost of living, then it does. 

For example, if it cost you a $1,000 in expenses to live your life back in 1850, these same expenses (hypothetically speaking) would cost you $31,519 today. 
Gold was priced at $20.57/oz. in 1850. Therefore, a $1,000 worth of gold back then would be valued $58,394 today. 


B. The two largest physical gold buyers are from India and China. They purchase 55% of all the world gold demand, up from 27% in 2003. 

One of the reasons for this robust demand is the increase in their per capita income. 

By combining both nations per capita, you can divide by the amount of gold purchased to get a factor. 

2003: $2,083 per capita equals 800 tonnes of gold purchase.
2014: $5,127 per capita equals 1,710 tonnes of gold purchase.

So, in 2003 the factor is: $2,073 divided by 800 = 2.6. 
By 2014, the factor is: $5,127 divided by 1,710 = 3. 
2025 (projection): $15,726 per capita equals 5,073 tonnes (assuming a factor of 3.1) of gold? 

P.S. The world produced 4,000 of gold last year. 
This is bullish for gold!

C. Gold, when measured in terms of the oil price should fetch $1,287/oz., assuming $32 per barrel oil. But if oil were at hundred bucks (it was two years ago) then gold should fetch over $4,000 per ounce. 
Since oil is the most used resource in the world, it very much ties in with the future of the gold price. 

D. Scarcity does not mean greater value attached. Platinum is the case in point, and despite being rarer than gold. Back in 1966, platinum was priced at $83.21 per ounce compared to $35 per ounce for gold. 
Now, platinum fetch $943 per ounce vs. gold’s $1,232 per ounce. The gold price in platinum terms would be $361.6 per ounce. 

If you are interested in the value of gold and where it stands as an investment then read my in-depth analysis of gold where I break down the driving factors affecting the gold price.

16-02-22,473j5p,"Management Guidance and Sector Popularity: Two things you're probably not looking at that greatly influence the future price of a stock","Hey guys,

I wanted to take a moment to talk about two things that (in my opinion), greatly influence the price of stocks that is often not discussed here: management guidance and sector popularity.

**Management Guidance:**

Most publicly traded company hold quarterly conference calls where the executives give forward looking statements about their company's financial health. Paying close attention to these statements is KEY! Nobody know a companies financial health better than it's executive team. Everything they say should be listened to closely and parsed out. Some companies are looser or more tight lipped than others, but you can usually get some idea about the amount of orders in the pipeline, the health of their sector, and next quarters expected EPS. Keep in mind that the stock market is all about looking forward. A company might have awful fundamentals today, but if their execs are vocally expecting great things next quarter (and there is reason to believe them), then you can be sure the stock is going higher. That's something you can't find on Yahoo Finance or FinViz.

**Sector Popularity**

Yes it's silly, but is many ways the stock market is a popularity contest not unlike high school. If one member of the clique is looking dorky, pretty soon the whole clique is looked at like a bunch of lame-o's. The market is no different, only this time financials are thrown into the mix.

For example: Let's say Intel gives weak guidance on their conference call. If that were to happen, you can be all but certain that the rest of the semi conductor stocks are likely going down. See you later Qualcomm, Qorvo and Skyworks. A scenario like this might not even be fair, as the other companies could have completely different customers and piplines, but still be caught in the whirlwind.  How about another scenario where pharma-turd Martin Shkreli makes an ass of himself regarding pharmaceutical profits. Guess what, now all the extra congressional attention on pharma profits has painted big fat targets on companies like Gilead and AbbVie. Other companies with more modest profit margins might be unfairly targeted here but it's likely that they're going down too.

My point here is to illustrate that even though a company might have glowing fundamentals, there are outside influences that greatly affect a stocks future price that won't be reflected in those numbers. I think that we would all do well to remember that. ",3

Would it be correct to say picking 2014, that the previous 5 years ending at 2014 have given a ~200% return (from 2009-2014)?

16-02-23,474ag6,"Angel investing and evaluating what ""fair"" means?","I've recently gotten into angel investing since I've come into some money and my first instinct was to help out friends and family that I know to have an entrepreneurial spirit. Keeping in mind that my first and foremost motivation was to enable others to succeed, I entered into talks with a friend about a possible venture. I won't go into detail but the deal was to essentially double my money over the course of 3 years such that the return was estimated to be about ~30% of the total profit in the same time frame. No equity, just a loan – this was all about helping people out, right?
 
Now, circumstances have changed and my friend wants to expand the initial operation. He is asking for more money but the offer remains the same and he will be doubling my money over the course of 3 years. However, based on my projections, the total return on my investment will now only be ~9% of the profit over the same time frame. Don't get me wrong, it is a great return on investment, but I can't help shake the feeling that this is deeply *unfair*. On one hand, I don’t want to free-ride on his venture but at the same time, I’m putting up 100% of the fiscal risk and the amount of profits does not exactly reflect all the “hard work” he will be putting in. Furthermore, this whole thing was supposed to be about helping people out so I don’t want to use my angel investment as leverage to get a better deal but I almost expect him to return that same courtesy. When we were beginning, we discussed operating under the principle of “friends first” so I guess I’m expecting him to share the projected profits in a more equitable fashion. Perhaps I am being naïve and he simply took advantage of my generosity, which deserves my ire, but I also can’t discount how good of a return on investment this is.

I guess what I’m trying to get at is that from the perspective of return on investment, this is a pretty good deal, but when looking at it more holistically, I’m think I’m getting screwed pretty hard. As you can probably tell, I feel pretty conflicted about this whole thing. I do plan to talk to him about it and get his perspective but I figured I would tap into this great community to get an outside perspective. Thoughts? Opinions? Discuss!",2

Secondly there seem to have been some issues about comments by Delta Air Lines that raised concerns about residual values of 10 year old aircraft, but these stories seem to have been refuted by several articles on seeking alpha.

16-02-23,479gww,A different take on Saudis and oil,"Most of what I read here and elsewhere indicates that the Saudis are pumping oil primarily in order to drive higher cost producers out of business, with retaining market share second, and putting pressure on geopolitical rivals third. 


What do people think about the possibility that the Saudis are trapped. The conventional wisdom says that they need to generate as much revenue as possible in the current environment, so like every other producer, simply have no room to cut – they need every dollar they can bring in, and can’t risk losing market share while other producers turn up the taps more if the price increases at all.


I suspect there is another reason why they are pumping pell-mell. That would be their concern that changes in energy policy and production, and CO2 regulatory processes will lead to oil being fairly uneconomical in the next few decades. Essentially they’re trying to pump everything they can while the price of oil remains above the price of production. They have enough oil in the ground that I believe they see they’ll have oil left long after it stops being a primary energy source.


I’m sure I’ll be shat on here, but I really think their need for money now and their desire not to have product left in the ground in the future is why they are not cutting production now. Any pain on higher cost producers is simply a small added bonus, but ultimately, of little account in their decision making.

California, particularly the northern area near Palo Alto and San Francisco has a high amount of investors seeking such companies, if that was ever something that interested me.

16-02-24,47c58n,"OPEC and non-OPEC must act together to halt the oil slump, Iraq official says","Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and producers outside the group should act promptly to rebalance crude oil markets or the damage could be deeper and take time to be fixed, Iraq’s governor to OPEC said Wednesday.

“OPEC has [been] recently focusing on market share rather than defending the price, and this gave the organization the big role in reshaping the structure of the global oil and gas industry,” Faleh al-Amri said at an energy conference in Abu Dhabi.

Amri, who is also the head of the State Oil Marketing Organization, said that sagging oil prices CLJ6, -3.04%  and recent volatility weren’t related to Iraq’s oil production, which has been growing at a steady pace and will continue to do so in the future.


“Our production does not have any serious effect on the price of oil. Demand on Iraqi oil is far more than Iraqi current production,” he said.

Iraq, however, is ready to cooperate in close consultation with all producers in OPEC and outside the group to maintain stability in the market and achieve a fair price, but the country will also try to maintain its share of global markets through “fair and reasonably flexible marketing policies,” Amri said.

“Iraq does not want to flood the market,” Amri said, adding that the country is still planning to increase its production to 6 million barrels a day by 2020 but will do it steadily.",1

16-02-24,47c6gi,What is the max contribution for married couples to 401k and Roth 401k? Am I investing too much?,"A quick google search tells me that the max contribution to a 401k is $18,000/yr, but I'm having a difficult time determining how that applies to married couples.

- I contribute to my Roth 401k with a company match
- My wife contributes to her standard 401k with a company match and also gets profit sharing bonuses
- We file our taxes as Married/Jointly.

Is the $18,000 per person? Are there some income limits?

In 2016, I've decided that we need to be investing more because we'd like to retire early. So I jumped the gun a little and just jacked up our deferral rates so more would be taken out of our checks. But I quickly realized that we might be contributing too much.

Current yearly contributions:

- Wife: ~$21,000 (This amount including profit sharing. Not sure if that still affects 401k max.)
- Me: ~$12,500

I also opened up a brokerage account so I could invest above and beyond our employers' retirement accounts. The current plan is to invest (safe, diversified) into that account so we can use those earnings as pre-retirement-age income and avoid early retirement penalties.

In summary:

- Is the 401k limit per person or per family?
- Is a Roth 401k treated differently?
- How, if at all, does yearly income affect the limits?

16-02-24,47frl0,A Case for Oil?,"Way back when, the men that pulled precious crude oil from the earth had a vision in their mind--lighting the lamps of the world. A huge untapped market. Oil was bullish, but as oil producers today still continue to do, there was no attempt innovation, only ambition to continue selling the commodity they extracted. Once the lightbulb was invented, lamps became obsolete. The oil industry never adapted.

Next, coal burning domestic central heating systems made the oil heaters obsolete. The oil industry never adapted... again. Luckily, the only thing to save their industry was the development of the revolutionary internal combustion engine (again created outside of the industry). Once this market started to level off in the 1920's, the World War's followed. Demand for aviation fuel was the thing that sent the industry up this time. Now the market is over-flooded with the commodity again.

Oil has never innovated themselves. It's a product consumers don't actually want. Think about it, when you go to the gas station to buy gas, do you really want the gas? No. You want to be able to drive you car. That's what you're paying for. Gasoline is simply the most efficient (capital wise) solution we have for that currently.

Without innovation of any kind, who's to say some other medium of energy, such as solar, won't take over the market?

Does oil have a chance? What will save it this time? Let me know what you think.

OPEC uses a basket of oil sources (shown on the link) - and it computes the daily composite basket price based on those sources...

The point of interest is ""we'll be fine with $20 oil"" - if you look on the chart, you'll see on January 20th, they hit 22.48... while our US low was around 26.05 ish... so clearly the blend is dragging the price down even further.

I'm fairly certain this is denominated in USD - I tried googling, it seems to be implied, but may wanna verify that.

So... if we get to WTI @ 20... their basket could be in the low teens :O",7

My first reaction as a newbie was to close my positions and not look at the market for a couple weeks, out of disgust. Eventually, I'd make my way back and start trading again. Then, the next no-way-this-shit-loses YOLO idea would present itself and I'd run that cycle again.

After 3-4 of these I moved all my money out of my brokerage account and into a robo account and left it there for a year (-1.7% return if you were wondering).

The robo broker's shit performance seemed to piss me off even more, so in DEC, I moved everything into an IB account with 6X margin and started trading options again. So far so good, until last week... How do you deal with YOLO fails?

16-02-25,47g329,How to win all of your stupid short term fake money trading games,"Every week there is somebody new posting about their high school/ college/ AP middle school ""investing"" competition. The winner is picked after some absurdly short period of time, after which everyone pats them on the back and the winner gets to feel like they must be an amazing financier destined to be the next hedge fund billionaire. The people who host and encourage these competitions don't seem to recognize they aren't actually teaching you anything about investing, and the winner is typically someone who made a concentrated bet on some risky position and got lucky. So with that in mind, and how bullshit these games are, here is your strategy to win your next trading game. It's completely stupid and manipulative, just like these games. Be advised, it requires the game to allow options, and you to be willing to part with a small portion of your real cash:

1. Find an insanely OTM option with literally zero open interest, zero volume, and just one existing ask for $0.01. I'm talking about the most illiquid, completely untraded, and obscure position you can find.
2. You take your fake investing account for this game and buy a shit ton of this position. Most of these games don't account for illiquidity. So you're going to load up on this practically worthless option.
3. Immediately turnaround and set a limit order to sell this worthless option at something like $0.05. Obviously the game wont let the order fill... Yet
4. In your real trading account, find that same illiquid option. You're going to place a real limit order to buy 2 contracts. That first one is going to get filled at the current ask of 0.01, but that second one is all of a sudden going to mean that there is a current bid of $0.05 for a moment before some algo goes ""who is this idiot"" and takes your $5. 
5. In that moment though, the game recognizes their is a bid for $0.05 and sells your fake contracts. Congrats, you just made 5x your fake money. Rinse and repeat until you win your trading game. ",33

http://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/tweed-partners-with-iconic-cannabis-connoisseur-snoop-dogg-568587511.html

Largest pharmacy network in canada is interested... if you read the article, that company interviewed (Peace Naturals) needed to turn down the offer because they could not handle such a massive supply. Biggest producer is CGC (tweed), you can bet they're talking to them. Shoppers drug mart (pharmaprix) is owned currently by Loblaws. Think how inclined they are to pursue this considering they needed to close down tons of loblaws because of walmart competition. However shoppers drugmart/pharmaprix is extremely profitable, they are gonna think about profits and how to please shareholders which means being the first ones to do it. ""Shoppers Drug Mart"" brand marijuana, tweed then becomes a wholesaler to the largest pharmacy network in canada. Trudeau would also be very inclined to helping this go smoothly since its one of his election promises. 
Think even, on the oddest chance that loblaws would be inclined to purchasing tweed. loblaws and pharmaprix are valued at 27billion$ and possibly looking to purchase largest producer in canada that is currently valued at 300million$ , seems extremely plausible, with loblaws more than able to pay a substantial premium on them too.

$CGC just signed a deal with snoop dogg last week, are about to report earnings tomorrow, and just got cleared today to sell cannabis oil from Health Canada. They are the largest legal supplier of MJ in Canada, they own 2 weed companies; Tweed Marijuana and Bedrocan. The opportunities are endless. Valued at currently 300Million$ serving approx 12,000 medical marijuana patients, imagine when they are able to serve 1-3 million canadians recreationally when the system is in place. Easily can 10x in market cap. ",0

16-02-25,47gfsp,529 College Savings Plan (x-post from /r/mommit),"We submitted this post to /r/Investing back in September, but we're still looking for more parents!

Hi /r/Investing,

This is Lauren Min and Lawrence Williams, two researchers at the University of Colorado at Boulder. We would like your help with a research study on college savings. For our research, we are recruiting people who are interested in opening a 529 College Savings Plan but have not done so yet. We will ask you a few questions, and ask you to visit the website of a well known financial institution to learn more about their 529 plan.

For participating in our research, you will be entered into a raffle for a $25 Amazon e-gift card. Our survey should take 5-10 minutes, plus any time you decide to spend on the external 529 website--how long you spend on that website will be up to you. The odds of winning will be 1 in 50, or better.

Unfortunately, our budget is not unlimited. Once we reach 300 started surveys, the survey link will deactivate. We will update this post to let you know when the study is dead. Winners will be notified within 24 hours after we close the study. At the end of the survey, we will redirect you to a different survey (to preserve anonymity) in which we will ask for your e-mail address. If you are a winner, we will e-mail you with details on redeeming your e-gift card.

We ask that you only take this survey if you meet the following criteria:

1. You are over the age of 18. 
2. You are a parent to a child 3 years old or younger. 
3. You have some interest in opening a 529 College Savings Plan but have not done so yet.

16-02-25,47gil1,Chesapeake Energy surged 23% today after saying it can pay off debt due next month. Time for buying puts?,"""Chesapeake Energy Corp. surged 23 percent after saying it will pay off the remainder of a half-billion dollar debt that’s coming due in three weeks with proceeds from asset sales that were twice as large as the company expected."" [source](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-24/chesapeake-asset-sales-increase-to-700-million-in-first-quarter)

Due to this very ridiculous increase in share price today, I started to research buying puts expiring March 16.

The [2016 guidance and FY15 financial report](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895126/000089512616000393/chk-ex_991x20151231x8kxpr.htm) shows several important points which influence my decision:

- Their total debt is still valued at over 50% of their total assets and their total debt is up 33% YOY  
- Total assets down over 50% YOY  
- 15Q4 lost 1B net cash from investing (acquisitions and drilling) and financing activities  
- 15Q4 EBITDA was -2.4B  
- Free cash flow of -160M  
- The 2016 outlook is poor, expecting production growth between -5% and 0%  
- Currently have almost 14K in written call options at $87.25 strike, indicating that they think oil is going to stay depressed and they will be punished by a significant bounce back in prices  
- Conference call was cut short at 30 minutes and no more questions were allowed   
- 2016 capital expenditures ""will be focused on shorter cash cycle projects"", most likely due to the tons of debt  
- **I am unsure about this part so please correct me if I am wrong**: Their conference call today mentioned they reduced debt by 2.1B from bond buybacks and debt restructuring since December. Their [8K](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895126/000119312515412911/d90939d8k.htm) filed Dec 23 says they issued 2.4B principal on their second lien in exchange for 3.9B in their new principal, the difference being 1.5B in debt reduction. This means they spent 600M in bond buyback, 240M of it on the March debt (according to Bloomberg).  

Accompanying press release:  

- Sold 700M in assets since Jan 1 and plan to sell off an additional 500M to 1B ""by year end"", totaling further asset decreases between 7% and 10%.  
- Produced 500M in net proceeds after selloff, but assets sold represented an estimated 4.5% of total production  
- They did not include information about short-term debt in the press release, but in 15Q3 it totaled 900M. Their long-term debt due in March was 500M  
- They have made zero progress on existing long-term debt, although they have started to repurchase their bonds  
- Last debt paid off was in June 2013  



**Analysis**: I think the guidance and financial report look very poor, and the press release on the same day announcing the sale of 700M assets so far this quarter is just a distraction. They are liquidating a lot of their assets and have not made any significant progress on long-debt in years. Yes, they raised 500M in proceeds so far this year, had 800M cash and cash equivalents at the start of the year, and bought back 240M of their March bond debt, but they have a negative FCF and 1.4B debt due on March 15. 

Short interest of 40% agrees with me, do you? Why am I wrong?",5

I'd like to have a career in the future becoming a fund manager and I think this is a good way to start. All of the information included was obtained from nasdaq.com and SEC filings from the from the company.

I am 16 years old and I am currently looking for strong long-term (10-15 years) investments. The following company is one that I'm interested in. Tell me what you think.

*Note: I do not own any shares of AmTrust. Please do the proper research before investing in any companies that I recommend.* 


**Company:** AmTrust Financial Services

Date: *2/24/2016*

**Stock Ticker**: AFSI

**Sector**: Financial

**Industry**: Property and Casualty Insurance

**Company Statistics vs Industry-Wide Stats**

AmTrust stock has a much better value than the average company stock in the property and casualty insurance industry based off of multiple factors 

First, its P/E ratio. Using data off of Yahoo Finance, AmTrust has a P/E ratio of 9.05 compared to the average P/E ratio of 19.1 for other stocks in the industry. Also attractive to the value investor is AmTrust's return on equity, which is 20.43% compared to the industry standard of 9.2%. 

AmTrust has a P/B value of 1.98, which is about par for property/casualty insurance companies which, on average, have a P/B ratio of 2. 

AmTrust also has strong profit and operating margins, 10.8% and 12.67% respectively, as well as a high quarterly year on year revenue growth of 15.40%. 

AmTrust has a dividend yield of 2.36% vs. the industry standard of 2.8%. However, I believe this small difference in price yield is more than made up for by the higher ROE and lower P/E ratio AmTrust has compared to other property/casualty insurance companies. 

**What exactly does AmTrust do?**

AmTrust underwrites and provides property and casualty insurance products such as workers' compensation, commercial automobile, general liability and extended service and warranty coverage, in the United States and internationally to niche customer groups that, generally, are underrepresented in the insurance market. 

The company strategy is to target niche, small and middle-sized customers using in the United States and Europe using a proprietary technology platform to efficiently manage the high volume of policies and claims that they receive. 

AmTrust approaches acquisitions conservatively by taking modest balance sheet risks, including acquiring companies, access to distribution networks, and hirings of established teams of insurance underwriters.

**Strengths and Future Opportunities**

A big strength of AmTrust is its key statistics compared to companies in the industry, indicating that the company stock is undervalued. 

Another big strength is the proprietary technology that AmTrust uses, which allows the company to ""appropriately price and structure policies, maintain lower levels of loss, enhance [their] ability to accurately predict losses, and maintain lower claims costs than the industry as a whole."" Wherever possible, AmTrust adjusts the terms, conditions, and exclusions of their coverage to manage their risk and increase their profitability. 

Another part of AmTrust's strength is the fact that the company targets niche customers where the market is not as competitive as the broader market and where AmTrust's level of expertise provides them with a distinct advantage over other competitors in the industry.

AmTrust and its principal insurance subsidiaries are rated ""Excellent"" by an independent organization, A.M. Best Company, an organization that analyzes insurance companies. ""Excellent"" is A.M. Best Company's third highest of 16 rating levels.

AmTrust's effective and robust policies are shown through the company's high retention rates for its insurance policies, with an average policy renewal rate of 86% for the years of 2014,2013, and 2012.

AmTrust has strong future earnings potential, with analysts predicting that over the next 5 years the company will grow earnings at an average annual rate of 11%. http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/afsi/earnings-growth



**Weaknesses and Risks**

AmTrust is currently involved in several class action lawsuits filed in February 2014 in the southern district of New York. According to their 10-K SEC filing, the company cannot reasonably estimate the potential range of loss. This lack of loss estimates suggests that perhaps there are potentially large losses at risk and that the company does not want to erode stakeholder confidence. That being said, I believe the claims made by litigators are unsubstantiated. The cases are currently in appeal, but judges have ruled in AmTrust's favor in the past. 

Volatile financial markets could adversely affect their business operations, financial positions, and liquidity. In the case of an economic downturn, lower levels of economic activity could negatively impact confidence in the company.

There are no policy limits on Amtrust's liability for worker's compensation claims unlike other forms of insurance. In the event of catastrophic losses or a force majeure, AmTrust could theoretically be forced to pay out significant amounts of money to the workers they insure.

A large amount of Amtrust's money (About $4.25 billion or 77% of their investment portfolio) is concentrated into fixed income securities. In general, the market value of fixed income securities decrease as interest rates rise. Conversely, when interest rates decrease the market value of the securities increase. According to their filing, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a $207.3 million decrease in Amtrust's investments. 

**Economic Moats**

What makes AmTrust much more effective at producing returns and reducing risks is through how its business is structured. AmTrust has three business segments: Small Commercial Business, Specialty and Extended Warranty Risk, and Specialty Program. AmTrust's moat comes in its small commercial business side of the company, with its small commercial business segment making up 49.3% of their gross written premium in 2014, 40.3% in 2013, and 34% in 2012. 

The small business segment for worker's comp, which continues to increasingly take up a majority of the companie's gross written premium, is less competitive for the large insurance market because of the lower average premium and smaller policy which do not fit the profitability criteria of their customers. This allows AmTrust to work in a niche market that allows them to make money consistently and obtain a portion of the market share that other insurance companies are restricted from.





**Analyst Ratings**

Although I take analyst ratings with a grain of salt, some people may find them to be insightful. To that end, all of the analyst ratings for AmTrust have been positive. According to: http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/afsi/recommendations  

Out of 5 analysts, 4 gave it a strong buy and 1 gave it a buy.

**Overall**

I give AmTrust Financial Services a BUY rating based off of several factors: its favorable P/E and ROE, its strong future earnings potential, and the unique way the business is structured to target niche clients in an underrepresented market. I believe the market is currently undervaluing AmTrust because of lower consumer confidence in the financial markets, and that the recent dip in its price is not based off of fundamentals.

16-02-25,47kfzq,Complicated back-door Roth conversion,"OK, I called my bank's ""financial advisors"" and asked about Back-Door Roth Conversion and he had no clue what that was.  So, I turn to Reddit.

History:
2010-2012, under limit, so I maxed my Roth Contribution.
2013, in the phase-out part of contribution, so my advisors took some of my contribution, after the fact, and placed it in a Traditional IRA.
2014, found out I surpassed the income limit so I had to place all of it in the same Traditional IRA.
2015, again, beyond the limit but now seeing if I have any options.

Recap- I have two accounts: 

1)After-tax Roth
2)After-tax Traditional

Question: Can I do a backdoor roth for 2015?  Do I need to consolidate all of my funds into the Roth first?  

This is all so confusing for me.  Thanks for your help.

I think all of us here at WSB (minus the 80% RH users) are sick enough in the head to just get that little extra bit of satisfaction from the short trades that go right. Nothing like riding a piggy into the ground and Left is is king of it. If you are long a stock and Citron writes an article about it, run for the hills because it's about to get crushed. He's the guy that did this to to [Valeant \(VRX\)](http://i.imgur.com/yQ50q59.png?1) and had [GoPro](http://citronresearch.com/gopro-to-30-within-12-months-the-comps-wall-street-isnt-talking-about/) as a $30 stock even at the peak of it's hype.  
The Left Playbook:

* Open a massive short position
* Post article as Citron Research 
* Get an interview on Bloomberg/CNBC
* Treat the anchors with utter contempt, basically flat-out accuse the company of fraud and[ just generally be a big, swinging dick](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-10-26/citron-s-left-what-valeant-s-doing-sounds-illegal-)
* Throw a couple of potshots at the company [CEO and Wall St. analysts](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2016-02-08/why-wayfair-s-business-model-isn-t-working)
* Toss a [tweet](https://twitter.com/CitronResearch/status/634428771127332864) out there
* ???
* Profit

Bonus Points: do it to enough Chinese companies that you are [wanted by the Chinese authorities](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2016-02-24/citron-s-left-free-speech-backs-hong-kong-case) for crushing their house-of-cards market.

The 60/40 stock-bond split has been largely recognized as the ""balanced"" portfolio, with the highest return for the least amount of std dev, hence this portfolio's 60/40 split.

16-02-25,47hjfd,"Invested more than someone in his company, both cash and labor. When is it mine?","An acquaintance let me reactivate his old Facebook page. It's a profitable business, but it needs a lot of taking care of and advertising investment.

Before I took over, this person hadn't invested more than a couple hundred dollars on Facebook ads and had only used the page for no more than a year. The page was abandoned for quite some time when I started managing it.

Ever since I took over, I've invested a couple thousand dollars on digital advertising of his Facebook page, and have been tending to it every day for several hours on end. The Facebook page grew from 2,000 to +7,000 likes in a little over a year, and the page's reputation is good enough that clients trust us now.

There was no contract, just a verbal agreement. This person is now wanting to take away 60% of all profits just because he noticed his page is taking up and now wants to get in on the profits. Yet he never puts in as much money or effort as me and the new team put in.

Would I get into a lot of trouble if I just kick him off the page as admin? I've invested hundreds of hours from my time and invested at least 1700% more than he has ever since he started with his Facebook page.

I wouldn't think of kicking him off the page if he wasn't such a bigot. I tried talking to him about a reasonable deal, having explained everything I just outlined, yet he simply refused to let go of more %. Apparently it doesn't matter that I invested more money that he's willing to put down for himself, and that his business grew to be both reputable and more profitable than he could have ever achieved.

Because he's a cheapskate, he wouldn't have invested more than a few hundred bucks on advertising, and would've used all the profits to buy booze or drugs. Whereas I've taken the risk of investing a significant sum to get this small online business/FB page to take off. I estimate I'll be investing at least 10 times more this year, and have a projected profit of at least %750 and could be hitting the jackpot if I manage this correctly.

Thoughts?

TL;DR I invested both a lot of my own time and money into an acquaintance's business. There was no contract, and now he wants a piece of the cake that took me so long and hard to build. I feel this business is now legitimately mine, but is it?

Edit: Someone correctly pointed out this is not a legitimate business or company, but a FB page. The guy never got a license and never intends to, but I want to as I would like to make this into an actual business.

16-02-24,47dtjc,RH account PDT questions.,"So I have a cash account with RH that is under 25k. So I was wondering if I be considered a PDT if I were to make more than 4 trades per day? I was given this link to find my answer.


http://www.finra.org/investors/day-trading-margin-requirements-know-rules

What the link says about cash accounts. 

Day trading in a cash account is generally prohibited. Day trades can occur in a cash account only to the extent the trades do not violate the free-riding prohibition of Federal Reserve Board's Regulation T. In general, failing to pay for a security before you sell the security in a cash account violates the free-riding prohibition. If you free-ride, your broker is required to place a 90-day freeze on the account.

So since it says day trading in cash accounts is generally prohibited, does that mean I shouldn't be allowed to day trade using RH?

How do I know if my trades violate the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation T? 

Also, why is it bad to be a PDT with under 25k? 

What does this mean for users that switch to RH instant?

- AMZN: Dominance in web services and online retail. Growing entertainment services. Growth potential from their R&amp;D for better delivery methods. Web services should continue to grow in importance too.
- GILD: Wanted to capture a little biotech. This is the only one on this list that I'm not well-educated on.
- GOOG: They own the most important platform in consumer computing: the browser. They dominate mobile, and they might come out dominating virtual reality and augmented reality too. They dominate AI research, which is my favorite field of growth in the next 10 years. Their robotics branch makes headlines occasionally, including just in this past week. Their services are ubiquitous, and their leadership is solid.
- LMT: They build the F-35. No division is more important for future combat than aerial attacks. They're heavily contracted for space enterprises. They're working on mobile fusion reactors. They have the famous Skunkworks division for R&amp;D. 
- MU: Great value at $10/share. DRAM is losing profit margin, but 3D NAND is next in line.
- NVDA: My favorite chip manufacturer because of the massive parallelism and its applications to AI, which again is the biggest growth opportunity in tech for the near future, that I see.
- RKDA: Low-priced firm that has tons of IP for agriculture. As water becomes more expensive, as farmland loses fertility, this is the kind of company that will reap the rewards. The IP appears to be consistently high-quality and thus is a major steal. 
- ROK: My best way to capture machine automation. When we talk about machines taking jobs, Rockwell is arguably the world leader for industrial applications. They do some specific AI-related things, but I think they also benefit from other companies pitching into AI growth, as their products will go with ROK's products.
- RTN: Aerial combat is the most powerful and easiest way to kill. Politicians get to keep their noses clean from maintaining presences in countries, and they get to do the dirty work. RTN supplies the missiles that help make this happen. They also make drones, and they do a million other things. All-around, diverse military contractor.",34

16-02-25,47ktq3,Self Directed Standard 401K - Performance,"I'm sharing to show that it is possible for people who are not with Wall St or have inside scoops to manage their own 401k. I'm just some average joe who has basic understanding of investing. This is not to say everyone should go out and start self directing their 401k. 

[Image](http://imgur.com/H6gDYmP)


Background: I got hired at my current job in November of 2010 and started contributing to my 401k. My employer contributes 3% regardless if employees contribute and if you contribute - they will match up to 5%. All funds from the employer is 100% vested right away - so no bullshit waiting period like some employers have.  Being 22 at the time I put all my money into the 2050 target date fund.  About two years go by and I notice that my performance is under whelming. So I elected to self direct my 401k. I've been self directing my 401k since 2012 and have had much better returns than my coworkers are getting with BlackRock  who manages the 2050 Target Date fund. 

Strategy: Since I'm limited to self directing 50% of my 401k (which I think is complete bullshit - its my money) I put the money in dividend yielding stocks that pay monthly to compound my return. I dont do ETF's or Index funds for my self directed account, I prefer to have dividend yields from select stocks and create my own ""fund"".  

 I leave the other 50% in the 2050 target date fund. 

I consider myself a high risk investor at this point in my life to try and get bigger returns for the risk. 

Long Term: I plan to do a direct rollover into a Roth 401k with Vanguard at some point to avoid taxes on withdrawls (once I retire) and the ongoing excessive fees from BlackRock.

Having downloaded the Robinhood app on my iPhone, allowing users to trade without having to pay commission, I noticed that Chipotle was taking the right steps necessary to clear itself from the E. coli issue it had been plagued with at the beginning of the year. On the day after Chipotle closed its restaurants to provide health education to its employees, February 9th, I put in an order to buy 2 shares @ $444.46, making up $888.92 of the $1k I dropped into my Robinhood account.

As I bought the stock, I began learning all about the tools stock people use to assess whether a current stock is over valued or under valued. I saw the stock rise steadily over the weeks. 

However, I began seeing a decrease in the growth in the past couple of days, which led me to investigate more about the company. I learned that Chipotle's P/E ratio is much higher than the industry average. Also, its not really expanding, according to its financials. Its net income is not incredibly stellar, and I came to the conclusion that Chipotle is more than likely still over valued... so I put in my sell order last night with the stock sitting around $525 a piece. By the time my stock sold in the morning, I was able to get $520.01 a piece before it fell even more (although the market is not closed today).

tl;dr

Bought 2 Chipotle stock @ $444 on Feb 9th. Sold them this morning @ $520 on Feb 24th. This was my very first stock trade, and with a mixture of scattered evidence, and a hell of a lot of luck, I bought at the bottom and sold at the top of the current short-term rally, earning $150, or 16.8% on $888. Not bad for my first time right??

Of course, I can't determine for sure whether I sold at the top or not...

I wanted to gauge your interest in a site that I'm currently developing.  The premise is presenting data, ratings, and other information regarding stocks and ETFs scraped from investment advising sites such as Zacks, The Street, Motley Fool and several others.  It would provide some neat visualizations and dynamic aggregate views.  I was wondering if you might consider this a valuable tool for your investment decisions.  Many of these sites, such as Zacks and The Street boast claims of consistently beating various market indices for years (although, a cursory glance of the data would suggest otherwise).  I've put up some screenshots where you can see ratings as a function of time as well as a table with scores taken from some of these sites.  All ratings in the screenshots have been scaled from 0 to 100 with 100=Strong Buy, 50=Hold, and 0=Strong Sell.

Keep in mind, this site is still very much in development and I plan on adding a lot more stuff.  Currently all the data is locked away on a private dev server, but I expect to be releasing a beta version in the coming months.  The plan is to allow anyone to access any of this data at anytime for free, no registration, no credit card, no bullshit.  All associated costs would be funded by advertisting revenue and donations.

16-02-24,47ep5m,Tax consequences of YOLOing - ridiculous schedule D,"So I just had to do all the tax inputs for my first year of YOLOing and my tax form looks [absolutely ridiculous](http://imgur.com/AnNntMG).

Not only is the dollar amount huge relative the capital I was using (started the year with 75k, ran it up to 175, lost 70 back and ended around 105k).  So my total sales were more than 100x my capital which is already silly, but the way the sales get reported it makes it look like I lost 6.5 million.  

I don't fully understand what it's doing with the wash sales, but it is really screwed up when you trade the same stock back and forth.  It's like it has you pay tax on a trade whenever you have a gain but doesn't let you take any of your losses until you sell the stock and don't touch it for a month afterward.

Anyway, this got me thinking.  Who here has a more ridiculous statement?  Things like

A higher ratio of sales to capital

Larger adjustments needed for wash sales

More digits in the total column (anyone in 9 or 10 figures)?

- thirdly if my option expires ITM and I take no actions, do I still profit off this? Or does it become null and i lose my initial cost i paid for these options aka just my debit i paid?

16-02-25,47iy84,Has anyone used suretraders or Ustocktrade? Both firms that circumvent the pattern day trading rule.,"I ran across these two firms. One is an ATS(dark pool) that provides $1 trading fee and $1 monthly fee. Here's the WSB [faq about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/46ii5o/for_the_noobs_switch_from_robinhood_to_ustocktrade/?)

&gt;It's some weird alternative trading system (ATS) created by Tony Weeresinghe who has been involved in the development and implementation of stock exchanges around the world. He has provided IT solutions to capital markets in more than 60 sites across 5 continents, including the one used today by the London Stock Exchange Group. London Stock Exchange so you know at least he knows his shit unlike the noobs at Robinhood. How an ATS works is it essentially tries to buy and sell stock not through a broker but directly from institutions. Yes, many of you probably didn't know this but there is a big market where people just exchange stocks directly and avoid the whole broker shit. It matches buyers and sellers directly.


The other one is called [suretrader,](https://suretrader.com/support/frequently-asked-questions/#faq-foreign-broker-dealer-vs-sec-registered-broker-dealer) a foreign brokerage entity that circumvents the PDT rule and has low fees and very lucrative margins.


Does anyone have any personal experience with these or know how they work?


The ATS works as a dark pool, I'm guessing this may have liquidity issues. The other is a foreign brokerage which means you have to do various forums and register them with the IRS/SEC. I found a few info on suretrader and it looks legitimate, nothing on the other one.

16-02-25,47jgpw,"Hello, reddit. Where do I freaking start?","I've been in the business of educating myself about investing, business, market and so on. I'ts not an easy task, theres a lot of lingo and concepts that I've been trying to wrap my head around, but I'm enjoying it. I'm sure some people can identify. A couple of days ago I tought ""I should go to the good people of the internet for some guidance"". I got the idea that I could pick some stocks, predict if they would go up or down in value, then in a month or so, see where I got it right and where I got it wrong, in hope that it would help me understand how things work. I soon realized I wasn't even sure where to go to do that, so here I am, looking for some guidance. 
Bottom line is, where do I even start, in order to understand what I'm getting myself into? Wheres the first go-to place? I think I'm in the right path, learning and all, but I'm all by myself here.",0

They may, for example, exclude the cost of laying off workers on grounds this won’t recur"". Skeptics tend to call pro forma figures EBBS, or earnings before bad stuff.

I am pretty new to investing, but have spent a considerable amount of time learning about various economic theories, trends, even some of the finer mechanics of investing and specific investment vehicles.   I am very passionate about learning about how to maximize my investments (ie, MAKING MONEY) and figuring out a sustainable long-term strategy for financial security (who doesn't..)

I also am a very serious supporter of Bernie Sanders. I personally support a lot of his arguments for regulation and restriction of some of the things that make certain markets so profitable, and I hope he becomes President. I realize that my financial goals are (in some respects) at odds with my political leanings, so I've been wondering what effect a potential Sanders presidency would have on the markets. 

I know a great deal of the responses will be speculative, but I would appreciate the opinions of people on what they think could happen for the individual investor, what the market might do, or ways that one might prepare for such a scenario.

Thanks, and happy investing!",3

Tradingadvantage.com

You sign up and there is 2 to 4 months of practice trading.  You get lessons, info, and all of your practice trades are monitored and critiqued by a professional.  

If you can turn 10k of fake money into 12,500 with in 3 months then they give you 10k of actual cash to trade with.  

So you can trade on an account with $10,000 of real cash, but here are the stipulations.  You only get to keep 60% of all the profits, they keep the rest.  No pattern day trader rules since you are trading on their account.  
If at any point the account drops under $8400 then it's all over and they cut you off.  



The catch is, in order to participate they want $2500 up front to get into the program.  

If you call under $8400 after you get real money you can pay another $1,000 to get refunded for 10k and it starts over etc...

16-02-26,47n5c0,Stupid question please answer without judging. New to investing,". I want to make another hypothetical situation. Let's now say I have 100K invested on a S&amp;P 500 index ETF with a 10% return annually. So to realize the 10% return, I cash it out by selling my initial shares I bought last year. so after this year, if I keep on cashing out my 10% return or whatever return I will make in the future, Does this mean eventually my shares will be all sold and have nothing left ?",0

I put together an Iron Condor on $SPY, and for shits and giggles I made the expiration today.  To my surprise, with a fairly wide b194.5 s195 P / s197 b197.5 C expiring 2/26/2016.... I have a $13/$37 Reward/Risk.

I must be missing some crucial element here, because that doesnt seem right. There is no time left, and that is (at a glance) an ok risk/reward. Unless something crazy happens by the end of the day.

What am I missing?

Currently the only drug able to treat hyperkalemia. Most effective in over 40 years I believe. Furthermore, the company just released its [4th quarter and 2015 financial results](http://investor.relypsa.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=956935) yesterday. In the first 10 days in February they had as many prescriptions as in the entire month of January. 

The stock plummeted with this news yesterday, even though it is promising for the drug. 

The only competitor is ZS-9, which seems to be sodium heavy and may not even pass FDA regulations. In any case, this will not be until towards the end of 2016. 

Am I missing something here? This drug should do very well in the 1st quarter this year right? and maybe we see some value returned to share price. ",13

Prior to the buyout talks making the news, $ADT was on a downwards trajectory hitting ~$24 at their lowest.

http://i.imgur.com/bYfHtuj.png

If you want to capitalize on the buyout talks, now it’s a bit too late for that. But there’s still gambling to be had. IF the acquisition, which is set to complete in June or so, falls through, we’ll see a quick drop in price. And that can be capitalized on. Optionality is great here.

16-02-26,47rp4u,Advice for my portfolio,"Hello all,

I am a 21 year old college student and I started investing around August of last year. Great time to start, lol. 

I wanted to see what advice fellow redditors could offer me regarding my young portfolio. I used Robinhood because I'm a student who likes free shit and my strategy is to become as diversified as possible for now, and years down the road start focusing on building up the specific areas that I want to focus on in my portfolio. I'd say my risk tolerance right now is moderately high mainly due to my age and time horizon. All of my investments have been bought with a long mindset.

Keep in mind my account is less than $2000 so nothing is weighted very heavily in my portfolio. Here it is:

ETF's:
Small, Mid, and Large Cap growth

Small, Mid, and Large cap value

Short term corporate bonds

Long term corporate bonds

Dividend equity

Individual stocks:
Coca cola, Pfizer, Merck, JPMorgan, AbbVie, ABM Industries, Occidental Petro, and a couple other smaller companies.

My plan with my next investments is to get some Government bond etfs, possible go international, or more ETFs that pay out decent dividends/coupons.

Tell me what you think so far. Thank you!",0

Mayer has apparently taken a more ""defensive stance"" to the idea of selling Yahoo's core product, while pitching her grand plan to turn around Yahoo with her earlier mobile-focused initiatives. Convincing large shareholders of her original turnaround plan would let Mayer keep her job without having to deal with a proxy fight.

At the same time, some sources told the Post that she's planning to lead the buyout process on her own, with the help of private-equity firms, reflecting a clear rift between Mayer and the rest of the board, which recently formed an independent committee to start the sales process.
It's all part of the big layoffs Yahoo announced earlier this month, which it said would represent 15% of its workforce, or roughly 1,600 jobs. The company said it would shut down some of its content verticals last week, while pulling the plug on its research center, Yahoo Labs.

* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)
* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
* Any big debts?
* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.

IMDrunkO, there was put buying in expectation of market weakness before next Fed meeting, but overall the GDP numbers, in addition to the inflation numbers, justify the Fed's early interest hike and give Janet much needed credibility. I think there will indeed be volatility in the day(s) before the Fed mtg., but regardless of the decision markets will have enough confidence in Janet that they will rise regardless (even if they hike, that will signal that Janet-the-genius can foresee inflation before the numbers appear).

In preparation, I think there is a fair chance that algos lose their shit--I will be setting very wide bid/ask prices on my trades in the days leading up hoping for this.

16-02-27,47stzu,Question on margin accounts and settlement times.,"So, if you sign up with a broker and want to buy and sell stocks, you can buy a stock on day 1, sell it later on day 1, but then you dont see your money until 3 days later as you wait for it to settle, this I know.

If you sign up with a margin account (usually a minimum of $2,000) I understand that you can get around the settlement times.  I also believe that you can set up a margin account, but still continue to use only cash on it without borrowing any money. Now, is the reason you can get around these settlement times because they no longer apply to you, or is it that the broker is now letting you borrow their money to invest because you set up a margin account?

In other words, I have $2,000 in my account, and on day 1 buy $2,000 worth of shares of a stock. On day 2 I sell all the shares for $2,500.  I have a margin account, so I am allowed to buy more stock on day 3 even though it hasn't been 3 days since day 1.  When I buy that stock on day 3 and spend $2,500, is that MY cash that I am spending, or is the broker saying ""I know he has 2,500 coming soon so I will give him 2,500 to spend"" and I am using lent cash at that point?

I heard that you can use margin accounts with only your own cash and not borrowing anything, is that a way that I could do that?  Or would I still have to wait T+3 in order to have actual cash again and not loans?

After more research about investing and learning about options, I wanted to switch to TD Ameritrade for their cheaper commissions and to use their Think or Swim platform so I opened an account with them at the end of January. I completed the dough options course for the certificate to use, and transferred some money to start off the account. Everything was going smoothly and I started using their paper trading on TOS to practice learning their platform while I was waiting for them to approve me for options trading then one day I tried logging in and it was saying that my login was incorrect, which it wasn't. I called them and they told me that my account was frozen and they were not able to give me any information on the phone and that I would be receiving information in the mail. They told me it was sent out on February 2nd and I still have not received any letter about what to do. To add insult to injury, I have received several things from them welcoming me to TD Ameritrade including a stuffed monkey, a letter saying I've been approved for different types of options and also options trading manuals and information/magazines. This is making me very stressed out because I have no idea wtf is going on. They won't tell me anything over the phone and I don't have access to the funds that I transferred. I don't know if I'm being impatient or being the worry-wart than I am but I feel like 24 days is plenty of time for me to receive the mail considering I have received everything else they sent me and I had just opened the account a few days before it was frozen so I was wondering if anyone has some advice or insight on what I can do to calm my nerves.

16-02-27,47x9v3,Berkshire Hathaway releases annual letter to shareholders for FY2015,"http://berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2015ltr.pdf

Key points:

* BNSF greatly improved service after 2014 by investing nearly $6B in capital projects, restoring customers' faith

* Precision Castparts Corp., acquired in 2015, will be another key component of Berkshire's earnings; they make aerospace components

* Insurance division continues to provide tons of float, more stable than it was a few decades ago since catastrophic coverage has been deemphasized

* Buffett is optimistic about America's future; our current GDP growth rates ultimately translate into a 34.4% increase in real GDP per capita for the next generation

* Decreases in insurance float would be to the tune of 3% in any given year, due to how BH's insurance companies write their contracts

* Calls for robust safety nets to take care of people who lose jobs due to productivity improvements, saying ""the price of achieving ever-increasing prosperity for the great majority of Americans should not be penury for the unfortunate""

* Addresses risks: BNSF losing significant coal volume; GEICO's premium volume shrinking due to driverless cars, along with dealerships; BHE at risk if electricity storage improves; online retailing threatening brick-and-mortar retail

* States biggest risk is a successful cyber, biological, nuclear, etc attack on the US which would probably affect more than just BH

* Climate change not a big risk to insurance companies since the contracts are typically renewed each year to factor in changes in underwriting estimates",37

16-02-27,47xlnh,Options trading for noobs:part2,"Since I have some time on the weekend I wanted to give out some examples of options trades based on [part1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/46qw56/trading_options_for_noobs/) of this series.

An example is a SPY trade. 

**Direction**- The bull run SPY has had in the past few weeks has burnt a lot of people with naked shorts on this sub. I think most of the movement in the past week was short covering purely based on the choppiness day to day. Look at the chart with some [TA](http://imgur.com/fgFkVOm). There is a 61.8% fib coming up at $201 level. That point would be perfect for a short IMO. 


**Look at the IV rank**- In the same chart you can look at the IV rank which is 28% currently. This means that volatility is low and it is better to buy options rather than selling them. Selling them would get you very low premium and hence high risk for low reward.


**Risk assessment**- As we want to buy options, you have two options here really:-

**Buying a put**- Although I don't advocate buying naked puts because of higher risk but lets discuss the possibilities. Lets say I buy a put which will break-even in the case SPY goes down 1% or to $193 (current price of SPY=$195). Looking at options prices for April expiration (48 days) seems like $203 strike put costing $10.15 would be perfect. The risk of this trade is $1015 which is the maximum you can lose and reward is unlimited if SPY falls below $193. Of course you won't hold this option till expiry and would like to close it around 20-30% profit. You can read more about this strategy [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haLytDhpnEA).

**Buying a put spread**- The second strategy hedges your bearish position as you sell a deeper ITM put against buying an ITM put hence paying the difference in premium. 


**Picking a strike** 1sd for April expiration is approx. =$10 ($195 puts are $5.60 and calls are $4.50, adding them gives 1sd). Since we are buying a put spread we would like our break-even to be $205. Lets look at some options here:

**Buying $205/208 put spread**- Cost=$2.59, max profit= $0.41, max loss=$2.59 with probability of profit=78%. This is close to 1:0.15 risk reward. If you do make $41 from this trade that would be 15% profit. And since we generally want to close at 50% max profit, that would be 7.5% profit. 

**Buying a $201/204 put spread**- Cost=$2.15, max profit=$0.85, max loss=$2.15 with probability of profit=70%. I wanted to show this trade as well since TA presents a strong resistance at $201 level. So a break-even around $201 would be a good bet. Here the risk reward is slightly better at 1:0.39 or 40% profit, 50% of that would be 20% profit.

**Buying naked $203 put**- Cost=$10.15, max profit unlimited, max loss=$10.15 with probability of profit=46%. 


**Managing winners**- As mentioned earlier take the spreads off when you reach 50% max profit. For the naked put I would take profits at 30% or do as the link mentioned before.


**Managing losers**- Sell or roll the put spreads when your break-even is breached. For rolling the position, if your sentiment is still bearish you might close this trade and open a similar one for May, if you want to roll for the same strikes you might have to pay additional, or you could do it for no money by adjusting the strikes. 

For the naked puts, take it off at 20% loss.

Stay safe and happy trading.

16-02-27,47xwbb,Are You Cut Out For Trading Penny Stocks?,"Not everyone is cut out to be a trader. The main reason I say this is because the most difficult part of becoming a successful at trading is that you have to learn to take complete control of your emotions. Some people are very disciplined and can learn to do this fairly easily, whereas most people lack discipline and these people have a much lower chance of succeeding. The latter group are also usually lazy who are not willing to put in the time and effort that is required to stay in the trading game long enough to get over the learning curve. 

People who are extremely risk averse usually struggle with learning to trade because they either want to cut off a trade the second it goes against them, or they are afraid to take a loss and get paralyzed by fear. Cutting off a trade too early results in you getting chopped up by ""market noise"" which has been put in place to scare you out of your money by the trading machines. Being too fearful to press the trigger and enter the market, will also cause a person to miss trades and inevitably lead to their demise, because the big home run trades are how traders grow their accounts to the tune of 100-300% per year!

At the other end of the spectrum, people that like to go to casino's and get a rush from gambling, are also more likely to fail because they are eager to take on too much risk too early. If you have an all or nothing mentality and are in the trading game to hit a home run every time  and get rich quick, you are misinformed and will suffer some serious pain. Luckily when i started out in trading I was somewhere in the middle which is exactly what  I needed to learn to trade. 

Trading successfully requires more than finding a system which defines when you buy and sell and how much of your trading capital you risk on each trade. While this is certainly important since you could go years spinning your wheels without this, you can have a very profitable trading system, but without understanding the emotional aspects of trading, you will never make it. The only way you will be able to tell if you are cut out for trading is get a few notches under your belt in the ""emotional capital"" department. I am referring to getting started and actually trading with real money. While paper trading certainly is something that every new trader needs to spend some time on, it is not going to help a person grasp the emotional side of trading. None the less, before a person should worry about this, they must first understand the structure of the market and how traders operate. To do this requires studying what is going on behind the scenes, and then practicing on a simulator and getting comfortable with a trading system and trading plan. 

The fact is if you can't make money while paper trading when emotions are taken out of the equation, you certainly are not going to make money when you start to trade with real money. So if you are anxious to get involved in trading I highly advise you to rethink the situation. First you should educate yourself for at least several months until you are comfortable you have a solid grasp of how trading penny stocks works, and only then should get involved trading with real money...",0

16-02-27,47y438,Warren Buffett shreds the most popular idea in economics,"The economics world is obsessed with ""secular stagnation"" right now. 

In short, this idea — which was resurfaced by Larry Summers in 2013 — says that there isn't enough demand in the US and world economies to create economic growth above 2%. 

Over the last 40 or so years, the US often enjoyed growth rates far in excess of that number. 

But Warren Buffett thinks concerns about what this 2% growth path means for the future of the US economy are far overplayed. In fact, he thinks the idea that this is bad news at all is just wrong.

In his 2015 letter to shareholders, Buffett writes, ""Some commentators bemoan our current 2% per year growth in real GDP – and, yes, we would all like to see a higher rate. But let’s do some simple math using the much-lamented 2% figure. That rate, we will see, delivers astounding gains.""

Here's Buffett working out the whole problem. (TL;DR, it's gonna be great either way)

Alright, so basically, I want to make a decision based on the ROR or GROR (This cash flow is actually the subtracted cash flow of two revenue streams), I'm deciding between going with 1 choice or the other, so I'm doing incremental analysis.

Basically, I already know my choice due to a + NPV and + PVR ratio.

However, when I do the ROR analysis, the ROR is negative. While GROR is +.

The ROR contradicts the NPV choice, while the GROR doesn't.

My reasoning to throw out the ROR calculation is: Cash flow changes from positive to negative, throwing off ROR.

While I know frm the equation of GROR, it differentiates between + cash flow and - cash flow, so it would be the ""true"" yardstick here.",0

16-02-28,47zl3z,$CMG DD - please criticize me,"Many other restaurants have had EColi outbreaks, Chipotle is not the first. 


McDonalds ($MCD) experienced an EColi Outbreak beginning in February 1982 (February through March and May through June 1982).  47 people in Oregon and Michigan were effected. The MCD outbreak does not seem to be comparable to CMG as McDonalds experienced only slight dips in stock price during this period and ended the year up.


Burger King - (1997), recalled over 25 million pounds of meat that made 16 people ill in Colorado because of food contamination. (650 restaurants in 28 states, or one out of four Burger Kings, had to take burgers off the menu.) Yum! Brands experienced an EColi outbreak with KFC in '99 and Taco bell in 2006. 


JACK seems to be the example that mirror's Chipotle best. 
Jack in the Box ($JACK) had a much worse EColi outbreak in mid January, 1993. The outbreak involved 73 Jack in the Box restaurants in California, Idaho, Washington and Nevada and has been described as ""far and away the most infamous food poison outbreak in contemporary history.""
-171 people required hospitalization
-4 children died:

Analysis
When the outbreak began (Jan '93) the stock was trading between $6.50-7.00 per share. It fell to $4.75 (down over 30%), rallied slightly, ultimately falling to a low of 3.87 on 2/22 and reaching 3.87 again on 3/5. It reached its next high for the year of around $6.15 on 5/24/93.
At this point it may have seemed like consumers had forgiven Jack in the Box and the stock had returned to it's previous level. However, in 1994 it was entirely down again and '95 it plunged below the $2.00 mark. It did not get back above $5.00 until October of '96, over 2 and a half years after the initial outbreak. In Feb '97 (over 4 years after), it briefly rose above $6.00, and was finally trading over $10 by Sept. of '97.

[Charts comparison](http://imgur.com/QmIfohk)

Chipotle is not a unique example of EColi outbreaks in restaurants. McDonalds, Burger King, Taco Bell, KFC, and Jack in the Box all experienced EColi outbreaks at some time in their history, from which all of them recovered. ​For these reasons, I'm short term bearish long term bullish on CMG (slow but steady rise to former levels). I expect recovery a little faster than Jack in the Box, even, as the outbreak did not result in deaths. Chipotle has started a huge marketing push to get back in consumer's good graces, including giving away a lot of free food. I have no position but I am considering initiating a bull calendar spread on $CMG with the long term call at least a year out.

I still have some confusion on the laws regulating pattern day trading. I understand that day trading is buying and selling a stock in the same day, and pattern day trading is having 4 day trades in 5 rolling business days. I saw another source that said you can buy a trade on one day, and sell it the next day, an unlimited number of times in a week with a margin account;. So for example----
starting out with 0 shares.
Monday: Buy and then Sell 100 Shares AAA
Tuesday: Buy 100 shares of BBB
Wednesday: Sell 100 Shares BBB; Buy and Sell 100 shares AAA
Thursday: Buy 100 shares CCC, Buy 50 Shares CCC (2nd trade) 
Friday: Sell 150 shares of CCC, Buy and sell 100 shares of AAA

The fear of a spike in interest rates is implausible. Lock in relatively high interest rates in advanced countries where they can still be found""

George Soros, Who is shorting the S&amp;P and bullish on the dollar, just bought this iShares high-yield corporate bond ETF:

https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239565/ishares-iboxx-high-yield-corporate-bond-etf

Mostly bonds from BB rated companies like Sprint and T-mobile. Average coupon of 6.39%, distribution yield of 5.89% after they take out their management fee. The yield is as high as it is because it's done poorly recently, down from to $79 from $91 a year ago. 

Given the (still) relatively high price of shares and the dim prospects for interest rates over the next five years, this is looking pretty good to me. I predict low growth over that time period, but the fears of a big downturn seem overblown. The spread between corporate bond interest rates and treasury bills is very high right now, but recent indicators show the economy actually isn't doing all that badly, and the odds of a recession in the next year are still pretty low. [This very good article, which shows that the correlation between the proportion of equity investors hold and subsequent average 10-year returns is 0.91](http://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/2013/12/the-single-greatest-predictor-of-future-stock-market-returns/), predicts stocks bought now will see returns somewhere between 5-6% annually over the next decade. Indicators based on PE ratios say something similar. That's no better than these bonds anyway.

Don't expect the yen to get much stronger than now in the decades to come, because even if things work out for Japan they'll keep it low to protect their exports. Have a lot of equities and other stuff in USD, GBP and CAD and make the buys when the yen gets stronger, which has worked out pretty well so far. But aside from the USD buys I don't have a clear theory on which currencies I should put things in, in what proportions or why.

I'm considering investing in Croda vs. other stocks in the specialty chemicals space. However, my attempt to assess Croda has been stymied by difficulty assessing its operating profit. Croda reports extremely low (~10% of sales) operating expenses, but I've read analysts reports suggesting the company is very sales and markeitng intensive and wages make up 20% of sales. I was trying to read their accounting to determine what they report as operating expenses, to determine how both those facts could be true; but I haven't been able to find any explanation on how they calculate op expense which would allow me to compare Croda to other companies. (Probably because its a British company outside of SEC). 

So, 1) does anyone have any insight on Croda and its op expense calculation; and 2) does anyone have any idea how to find out more about this?

16-02-28,483xg6,Explaining Margin accounts,"I have been trading options using a strategy where I sell cash secured puts and then if assigned, turn around and sell covered calls in a cash account for about a year now.  I have a 90,000 USD cash account.  I am trying to understand that if I open up a margin account, when is that margin calculated.  Lets take my 90k portfolio as an example.  I am currently with optionshouse and I assume different brokerages may vary but I am looking for a basic information.  With 90k cash, that means my account value in 90k, my cash buying power is 90k and my margin buying power would be 180k.

Lets say I sell the following puts (I'm using the google options chain right now which on a Sunday will not be accurate but this is just for example purposes) All MARCH 4 expiration:

2 CVX 81.50 strike puts collecting 100 dollars in premium
1 AMZN 505 strike put collecting 75 dollars in premium
2 TWX 64.50 strike puts collecting 90 dollars in premium
2 YUM 68.50 strike puts collecting 72 dollars in premium

16-02-29,488o16,"Question about Croda (Specialty chem stock, xpost with r/investing)","Hello all,
I'm considering investing in Croda International, a specialty chemicals company, and comparing it vs. other stocks in the specialty chemicals space. However, my attempt to assess Croda has been stymied by difficulty assessing its operating profit. Croda reports extremely low (~10% of sales) operating expenses, but I've read analysts reports suggesting the company is very sales and markeitng intensive and wages make up 20% of sales. I was trying to read their accounting to determine what they report as operating expenses, to determine how both those facts could be true; but I haven't been able to find any explanation on how they calculate op expense which would allow me to compare Croda to other companies. (Probably because its a British company outside of SEC).

So, 1) does anyone have any insight on Croda and its op expense calculation; and 2) does anyone have any idea how to find out more about this?

Here's a link to their annual report. http://www.croda.com/home.aspx?s=1&amp;r=1172&amp;p=8173

16-02-29,488rkn,Why forex markets is better than domestic markets”,"Many a person wonders why organizations, companies or even countries prefer to trade in the foreign exchange markets rather than its own domestic market. To understand this choice of trading and its reasoning better, let’s start with a simple description of both the domestic as well as the foreign exchange markets.
Domestic market is an internal market of a single country wherein trading is based on the demand and supply of goods, services and securities of that country. Foreign exchange markets, commonly termed as “Forex markets” allow an entity to trade in other countries utilizing the currencies of the countries.   Imagine an American tourist traveling to India, he or she will have to pay for the food in a local stall in Indian rupees not in US dollars, for which the tourist must convert US dollars to Indian rupees for the services rendered in India. If this was not possible, would the tourist be able to travel to India! This is a simple example of currency conversion. Companies, organizations, even countries trade in currencies to meet their requirements, making forex markets the largest financial market in the world.   The entities gain based on the movement of prices either upward or downward. In cases, when buying takes places, and the prices are moving upward, profits are made. This is termed as go LONG.  In cases, when selling is taking place and the price is moving downwards, profits are made again. This is termed as go SHORT.
Domestic market is confined to a particular country, thus limiting the chances of investment. It has a limited market size.  Forex market allows investments in other countries, bringing in expansions, exposure to other work cultures, increase in the market reach, and thus inevitably brings internal growth. The Forex market is also flexible in the size of the deals, based on the capability and capacity of the trader. It could be standard, mini or even micro making it a comfortable form of trading even for a small trader.
Another important aspect is that a trader only needs to lock 0.2% of his trading volume at any point of time for margins With 1:500 leverage. This locked trading volume is termed as the good faith deposit and it is on a temporary basis. In trading with a standard lot volume of say $100,000 the actual locked amount is only $200 (0.2% of $100,000)
One of most significant aspect of the Forex market is that an individual can directly trade online without the requirement of middleman. Usually no trading fee or commission is collected when trading is done online. The brokers take advantage of the spread i.e. the bid price or the ask price, the traders buying or selling prices to or from the brokerage thus earning their compensations.
Demo Accounts can always be created for practice before venturing into the real trading world. 
The Forex market works continuously, even if the market is closed in one part of the globe, it is working in the other part. It utilizes the time difference between countries to ensure, that trading happens 24 X 5 .The only exceptions would be weekends, making it possible to trade anytime anywhere.
The Forex market is completely decentralized; there is no “one office” or “one location” thus helping in increasing the work power, improving the work culture, improving the skill set in each country to standardize to a global level. It also helps in amalgamating individual trends, cultures, predictions of each country into a large overall view of all the countries in the world.
The Forex markets help countries in taking immediate steps to mitigate financial issues by utilizing the help offered by other countries or agencies either through purchase or credit.
The domestic market has the disadvantage of limited resources, while the forex market gives the advantage of utilizing the resources of the entire world, of course based on the purchasing power as well as the credit capacity of the entity. It is the most liquid market.
In this era, communication is a strength, which the forex market utilizes, all decision can be taken over the counter electronically, and it removes the limitations set by culture and language. Easy communications, decisions and overall improvements in inter relations between countries is a byproduct of this kind of marketing.
    
What makes forex market important and much better than the domestic market is its ability to adapt, absorb and evolve keeping the whole world in view, as a single entity with unlimited opportunities for improvements, growth, expansions and thus create one large global family!

Valeant Pharmaceuticals International
The Saga Continues
What's new? Mike Pearson returning; 2016 guidance withdrawn
Valeant announced that Mike Pearson is returning as CEO, effective immediately.
Given the timing of the return, Valeant will reschedule its previously announced 4Q15
earnings call for tomorrow. It's also withdrawing its prior 2016 guidance and will
update its 2016 guidance in the near term. Valeant also indicated that going forward
the roles of Chairman of the Board and CEO have been separated, and Robert Ingram
has been appointed Chairman of the Board. The press release also confirmed that
Allergan has filed an ANDA containing a P-IV certification for a generic Xifaxan 550 mg.
Our takeaway: Good news, bad news
We are not surprised that Mike Pearson is returning as CEO, but given our many
discussions with investors, it seemed that the investment community was about 50\50,
so many will be surprised. We view this news as a positive for the long-term prospects
for the company, as we think Mr Pearson is the strategic visionary and ""out of the box""
thinker that is needed to pursue this business model. The bad news is that the company
needs to further delay reporting numbers and is pulling guidance, which we have to
assume means numbers are coming down. With that said, we think investors have
been very skeptical of the numbers anyway, so we don't believe this news will really be
that surprising to many. Regarding the P-IV filing on Xifaxan, this is really not that
surprising as many branded drugs get P-IV certifications. Importantly, we would remind
investors that several companies have vetted the product's IP, including at least
Allergan, Endo, and Valeant, so we think investors should not be so quick to assume
the negative scenario.
Thoughts on the stock: Probably trades down but very hard to determine
While many investors will probably agree with us and view Mike Pearson's return as a
positive for the long term, we think most will be more disappointed that numbers are
still uncertain and this may pressure the stock in the near term. Given the current
valuation, we think patient investors will be rewarded.

Valuation: We maintain our Buy rating and PT of $213
Our price target is based on a P/E of ~14x our 2017 EPS estimate of $15.20.

So, thank you for taking the time to read this.
 
&amp;nbsp;


**What I want**

I want to become involved with financial markets, I'd love to do equity research and eventually I want to move to funds/portfolio management.

&amp;nbsp;

**Here is my story**

(*Just to be clear, I take full responsibility for my poor decisions, lack of effort and general apathetic lifestyle.*)

I finished highschool with top 10% grade but didn't want to do anything.

Took a gap year, played video games, hung out with friends and accomplished nothing.

I then spent a year at Uni studying physiotherapy, it wasn't for me so I stopped.

Unsure of what to do with no goals or ambition I took another year off study and worked for 2 companies full-time.

After that year, Uni was back on the table and and I stuck it out this time (thank god) graduating 3.5 years later.

So then I had a Business degree majoring in Finance, no internships of work experience and a 4.25 GPA ( 4.25 is about 55% for people out side of Australia).

I spent the next 6 months not being able to get a job in the investment sector, got a job in a call center for few months, then finally got a job in a retail bank as a personal banker (in hopes to gain access to internal transfers/jobs).

&amp;nbsp;


**So here I am today**  
Sad, defeated, regretful and full of questions I don't have the answers to.

Also, no relevant work experience, low GPA and a limited network.

&amp;nbsp;

**My current network**

Through uni I was paired up with a portfolio manager who I have coffee with once every few months. He is really helpful, through him I met a man that owns a funds management firm that may have an opening (I'm meeting him this week).
I've cold called a lot of companies and also just shown up and dropped off a resume looking for work experience. These efforts have probably netted me 8 or 9 coffees with people that help me with information but no work opportunities.

&amp;nbsp;


**What I've been doing now that I truly appreciated the depth of how fucked I am**

1.  I've been studying 3-5 hours a day and 5-10 hours on weekends for my CFA level 1 I sit this June
2. I spend between 30-45 minutes a day reading financial reviews, investing blogs and related investing content.
3. I have a long list of books I'm going to read once I've finished my CFA level 1 exam.
4. I already have been but I'm trying to network as much as I can, less so now that I work and CFA preparation.
5. I'm involved with the ASX trading game to try and get a deeper understanding of trading.
6. I have a portfolio of two stocks

&amp;nbsp;

**My Plan**

Stay at current role until June, talk with my manager about my goals and ask for her support to move internally to a more suited position. 

While doing this apply aggressively to roles that I previously was out competed for (having passed CFA level 1 should open doors to a few more interviews) 

Come September move to Sydney as there is more potential and more networking opportunities if I still haven't found a role related to investing.

Failing any progression towards equities research or a junior financial analyst position I am contemplating doing my masters in applied finance, in hopes to network, gain access to IB graduate programs and increase my skills and GPA.

&amp;nbsp;


**My Dilemma**

First of all, because I never tried at university I've essentially spent last 5 years of my life struggling, feeling like a failure. After that, finishing uni and getting knocked back from everywhere crushed what little spirit I had left. I don't think I have let myself feel truly happy or appreciate much in the last year. I don't think I have depression or anything of that nature, I think I'm sad because I grasp the depth of how fucked I am, of how behind I am and how near impossible my position is. I just become so overwhelmed being able to see so clearly all the mistakes I've made and the horrid position I am in today because of those decisions. **HOW DO I GET PAST THIS MENTALLY AND EMOTIONALLY?** 

Second, I just don't know what else to do. I don't know if there is anyway I can undue my low GPA bar committing 2 years to a masters degree.

I'm terrified that my life is decided, that my track record on my resume depicts the person that I was in place the committed student to investing that I'm becoming. 

&amp;nbsp;

**What else can I do?**

What excel skills should I be developing?

Which programs that analysts regularly use can I become accustom with from home?

Can you offer any advice or guidance or at least brighten my bleak outlook on where I am?

If you are an analyst or a portfolio manager or anyone in this field with experience, could you set me a task? Say, review this stock and report back to me your findings, then critique my report?

If you are in the investing field, would you mind sending me your email in a message so that I can ask you a question from time to time, or hear your own personal struggles and triumphs?

I'm literally open to anything and everything.

Thank you for taking the time to read this

so to shorten the questions up:
1) with $500 and good amount of beginners knowledge, do you think i would be ok to hop in?
2) what brokers do you prefer and why?",8

I am wondering if anyone can point me in the direction of a good starting point for me to read up on before I begin seriously starting to build a portfolio.

A little background info on me. I own a bit of silver, and have bought stocks in Canopy Growth Corp. (A Canadian venture marijuana stock if memory serves.)

So a couple of questions.

1.) What is a good source of concise information for someone with only a small bit of knowledge. If there is a reddit post, can you link to that? I apologize in advance if there is a post that exists and this is redundant.

2.) What is the point of building a portfolio? 
My understanding is as follows: you invest money hoping that your $100 invested today will turn into $150 down the road.

3.) When it comes to buying stocks through a bank is it good practice to purchase only when you are ready to buy a lump sum seeing as there are fees(?), or are microtransactions advisable if you are not sure.

3b.) Is it advisable to manage your own portfolio, or get a person from the bank to do it until one is comfortable navigating themselves.

Thanks in advance everyone, I will respond with followup questions, and praise!",7
