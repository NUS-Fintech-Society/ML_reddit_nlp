16-03-01,48e4n3,"I'm the guy that worked at that trading shop in NYC. Here's my story and other stories.","Hey guys, I posted a bunch of comments [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/480qjf/have_you_ever_met_a_successful_day_trader/d0gvccr). I will try not to re-write stuff, so I will just link to the comment where I discussed that topic. That top link has a bunch of links, and if you read through I posted a few more minor answers. Thanks for all the support and PMs, feel free to PM me. I still trade, I still follow the market, I still love talking and discussing this stuff. I'm mostly a lurker here, but when someone asked about profitable day traders, I decided to poke my head in. TLDR, I worked at an interesting shop, with interesting personalities. In the end I went out in a flame of glory (not really, I was having a bad year, but wound up getting a pretty good job based on what I learned trading) 

English is my second language, so if I don't make sense its because I've only been in this country for 25 years. 

**People asked how I got into it:**

I've always been into tech. I've always been into logic games / chess / mastering some sort of game/system. I've wanted to trade stocks since high school. I remember this vaguely, but we played a fantasy basketball game, called SmallWorld (I think) where you would buy a player, then each week his value went up or down, and you got that value to shop for next week (it was a really good idea, I dunno why it died out... who wants to remake it with me?). Over the course of the season, if you picked the right players your account went up and you could dominate more and more. I was fascinated by that concept. After a few years of that, fantasy sports changed to exclude financial concepts. Somehow my friends and I progressed to following stocks because they were easily accessible from the library online. My first trade involved me badgering my dad to buy into Google's IPO. He bought 10 shares for ~$1000 to appease me. We never sold those shares (or at least he denies selling them to me. He claims to still have them in his account, but I don't believe him, he probably sold them in 2008 when the world was ending puss).

I did OK in high school, went to a PA State school, majored in finance. I had a mediocre GPA, but had a very good major GPA and did great in equities/derivatives/analysis type classes. In my last year, I tried REALLY HARD to get into some GS / BSC / LEH / JPM / WFC type job. No offers. I wasn't a standout student, I wasn't at a standout school, and the jobs they recruited for at our school were mostly tax/accounting type jobs.  Anyway, I got a job in the Capital One management track type program. It was a GREAT job straight out of college, $60k + bonus. The only problem was that Capital One's campus was in Bumfuck (read McLean, VA) and I was reallllllllllly hesitant to give up the NYC dream for McLean, VA (no offense people, OK). Either way, I said yes to Capital One. Then I took the $5k signing bonus they gave me (to move to VA) and dumped it in a currency trading account. Over the course of the next 3 months, I turned it into ~$17k. All the while I was mentally uncommitted to Capital One, I kept trying to interview for something else at job fairs. 

One of these companies was a shady type trading firm, saying something like ""NYC trading job, no experience required, no money required, will train, weekly draw."" I was all in immediately. I went to the interview, but was already going to be working there whether they hired me or not. I felt like I prepared for this interview my whole life. Hit it off immediately and got the offer. $500 a week to live in NYC, LOL. But none of my own money down, and I was going to learn from PROS!! I didn't care if I had to live on the streets. Luckily, even though my parents were kind of skeptical, but REALLLLY didn't want me moving to VA, so they agreed to help me with my first year in NYC so I could do what I always wanted to do (at this point I told my dad that those Google shares would be my rent for the first year). So I returned Capital One's $5k and moved to NYC. 

Learning was weird. From the moment you got there, it was sink or swim. I think it could have been a better/smarter experience. They almost had a draft for the new hires, with the exception of the [weird guy's test](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/480qjf/have_you_ever_met_a_successful_day_trader/d0hbtia), it was almost like a NFL draft but with no combine. They drafted us based on look and 1-2 mins of conversation. I would have done some personality matching, but whatever. I got paired with the [animal described here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/480qjf/have_you_ever_met_a_successful_day_trader/d0gvccr). To summarize, he traded the ""feel"" of the market by looking at just the level two quotes. He only traded 4 stocks, but mostly Google, because it was an expensive stock that traded thinly enough to move a few dollars up or down like its nothing, but with enough volume that you didn't get stuck in your position. He used no type of analysis that I was used to. No charts, no news, no market, no analysis, nothing. Level two bid and ask, that's it. This was VERY odd to me. I spent the last 4 years learning how to analyze stocks, and here's this guy essentially saying fuck all that, this is what you do. It took a while for me to wrap my head around what was going on. I kept wanting to analyze what the stock was about, what the company did. I kept wanting to hold companies because I thought they were good. I kept losing money. It was almost worse for my learning curve that I had this other experience. I was being UNTRAINED. I had lots of ""bad habits."" 

This is mostly why I thought this was a bad way to pick your trainees. There were guys that were more in line with my mental outlook on life. I envied the fact that their trainees could talk what's up what's down, discuss different industries, batches of stocks, outperformers, look at charts, etc. I got over it though. 

In the beginning, I had a very bad month because I kept trying to be long stocks. Me and my trainer got in a fight because he was basically like, ""look, you're not picking up what I'm putting down and it doesn't even seem like you're trying to. Do you want someone else to train you.""  Truth was, I did. But I watched this guy make ~$100k a month for three months straight. Maybe before I give up, I'll try to learn what he's teaching. So I said, ""fuck no. I want to learn."" For the next month, my punishment was that I wasn't allowed to trade. All I was doing was watching level two quotes for Google, ALL DAY. No charts. I was allowed yesterday's high/low, the week high/low, and the month high/low.  Between 9:30 and 4, I could get up from my desk for lunch, and to go to the bathroom. That's it. Even if they left to the bar / golf course when they made enough money for the day, I had to stay there and watch. They disconnected my keyboard. This probably was the best thing that could have ever happened to me for my trading career and market understanding. 

At first, I would sit there and call out trades, buy here, sell here, after the second day. One time I yelled, ""YO GUYS, CHECK OUT GOOGLE, ITS EITHER GONNA GO UP OR DOWN FROM HERE."" Yea, I said that. Whole trading floor dying. It stuck with me. ""Yo @discountphilly, what you think of ____. Is it gonna go up... or down from here?"" So after the first couple days, I had to sit in silence. On Friday of the second week my trainer told me. ""You have 1 trade today, 100 shares, in and out, use it wisely."" I sat and sat and sat and sat, finally when Google lined up in a way that I'd seen 10 times already in the past week, I bought 100 shares. I made $3.50 in a quick jump and cashed out. The next week I had 1 trade a day. I did pretty well, only had 1 loosing day out of 5. Not huge days, but I was getting the idea. The goal wasn't to get to know and coddle a stock, it wasn't to get emotionally involved.... The goal was to sit in the brush, a quarter mile away, line up the perfect trade in your scope, then HEADSHOT. That's it. Get out. Find your next trade. 

After the 3rd week I got 5 trades a day. It wasn't until my 5th month there that I got to trade how many ever shares I wanted. This time gave me the ultimate deep (aliens guy) appreciation for the market. Almost like it ruined Santa Claus for me. Its not about companies, and its not about profits and not about management. Its about buyers and sellers. RIGHT NOW, are there more buyers, or are there more sellers. That's it. Its much more a game of psychology and thinking about ""What is the market (read buyers and sellers) showing me, what does it want me to do, what should I be doing?"" We were swing trading, very short term. Either we were riding the momentum, or we were waiting for stocks to get overextended in one direction, then bet against the trend. The way we read this, was by getting a feel for the level two quotes. Understanding where the levels are, where they buyers are, who is selling where relative to those levels and watching the prints go down in real time. That's it. In my experience, over the years, computers have really taken this strategy away, for the most part. There is too much hidden action and too many false positives. But the guy that trained me is unfazed (or at least last I heard). I can discuss that later.  

____________________________

Guys I'm getting tired. Ask me questions. Sorry if you didn't want to hear about me. I was going to talk about the strategies I picked up, how computers impact things, and I can tell you about personalities more later. I will absolutely talk about losers, losing months, losing several months in a row, being done... coming back... being done again... 

I'll come back later this week. **Please feel free to ask specific questions.** I dunno what you want to hear about. Not anything personally identifiable, like who these people are and where I worked. Prop shop in NYC, there were at least 6-7 small ones that I knew of and 3 big ones, lets say one of those 10.

16-03-01,48dxty,"A note on corporate cost cutting and ""restructuring"" plans","When large corporations start to stagnate, lose profits, not grow anymore, etc. so called 're-structuring' plans are introduced.  What these plans usually do?
- Cut workforce, mostly lower, yet directly involved in manufacturing, levels
- Cut investments on research and development
- Sell parts of business
- Freeze salaries
- Freeze hiring
- Spend money and time on new plans and strategies

The management thinks of improving the business fast by doing all these. However, the real outcome is, sometimes, very different. Losing experienced lower level, employees cause irrecoverable slow down of certain functions, such as manufacturing.  The employees those who stay would have double or tripled workloads which lead to poor quality outcomes. Hiring freeze would make this situation even worse. Despite all that, you will have so many new plans and strategies but no one capable of executing them.

Examples:
Yahoo (YHOO), IBM, Boeing (BA), ConAgra Foods (CAG), Twitter (TWTR), Weight Watchers (WTW), HP (HPQ), Sears (SHLD), AMD, Radio Shack, Blackberry, NetApp, Texton/Bell Helicopter (TXT), and so on. 

The biggest thing almost all corporations do not understand is the business failure is primarily caused by management ineffectiveness. Investors thinking that a business would turn around with the same old management, with a new restructuring/cost cutting plan, is far from reality.",2

16-03-01,48hz7g,"Wouldn't it be really easy to make money day trading if you had a lot of money to invest?","Go look at GOOGL stock for the last five days, there are positive fluctuations in price over a course of several minutes all throughout the day of anywhere between $0-$15.

Now lets say you studied and studied this stock and we'll STILL assume a conservative situation where you were able to buy and sell shares to net +$2 a share each day only once a day. Not be able to net $5 a couple times a day or something crazy, just $2/share on one trade each day.

If you started with $100,000 and bought all the shares you could at $735 (what it currently is as as I write this) you would have 136 shares, and if you conservatively netted +$2 a share, you would have made $272 in a day, multiplied by 250 trading days a year, $68,000 in a year.

That in itself is a very nice salary to live each year on, and thats without assuming you reinvested your gains and were able to buy more shares a day.

The only problem I could see is if the stock continued to go down throughout the day to which I would argue that you have google stock, that stock has intrinsic value, its VERY likely that google will continue to grow throughout the coming years, so you could hold for a couple days until you see your $2 gap and sell.

Even if you had to wait 3 days in order to find that $2 gap, and you had to do that each time for the full year, that would still be 62.5 days you can trade a year, which would net you $17,000 or 17% of your initial investment which beats the average market return twofold.


So I've given you one of the low end situations. What if you were actually really good at this and could make $4/share twice a day? I don't even want to do the math on that.

Whats wrong with this strategy assuming you bought, held, and waited for the price to go up $2, studied your stock, picked a good stock that has intrinsic worth so even if you didn't see many gains, you wouldn't see many losses and could hold long term if you had to, and assuming you had $100,000 that you could dedicate fully to investing? I mean I see it not working on smaller scales because if you only have $1000 to invest you could only buy and sell one share, netting you two dollars and costing you ten to perform the transaction, but how does my large scale strategy not work?",0

16-03-01,48i9ak,Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.,"Summary

Terraform Global has dropped from an IPO of $15/share to as low as $2.11/share. The Yieldco has dropped largely due to liquidity concerns at sponsor SunEdison.

As of the third quarter 10-Q, the company's net asset value per share was about $8, thus current purchasers are getting the stock at a 60% discount to NAV.

The company has just confirmed their quarterly dividend of $.275, or $1.10 annualized. At current prices, this equates to an annual yield of 35%.

Certain agreements with SunEdison create a situation where the minimum dividend is almost certain to be paid for the next nine quarters, and likely longer, unless SunEdison declares bankruptcy.

Even if SunEdison does declare bankruptcy, the Yieldco would still be able to maintain a reduced dividend.

After researching I decided to invest in ETFs or FUNDs tracking the market (S&amp;P500 or similar). Now, my problem is I believe we are approaching a bear market, so I don't think that investing in ETFs is a good idea, since I expect the market to go more or less downwards for the next 2 years, and start recovering after that.

My question is, where can I invest my money safely for these 2 years?
I am not sure about bonds, if they are traded in the secondary market, this doesn't make them safer than stocks, or am I wrong?

If UWTI is designed to amplify daily moves in oil 3x then why when we see oil start to rise would this ETN somehow produce negative returns? 

For example if I buy 1 share at $2 and hold it for x period of time I still own 1 share regardless of what happens over period x. If the ETN is designed to amplify daily moves why can I not Expect UWTI to move to $4/share (made up number) when oil starts to rebound? At the end of the day I purchase 1 share at $2 and I sell 1 share at $4 

$2 to $4 is a 100% return and because this is leveraged oil would only need to move 33%.

I understand UWTI is an ETN not an ETF 
I understand UWTI has a 1.35% expense ratio 
I understand timing the oil rebound would be extremely difficult, but in my opinion 
       1) Oil is suffering from a manipulation of supply 
       2) Demand for oil is still growing although maybe at a slower rate than before

Its simple supply and demand isn't it? There are estimates of oil drying up in 2050, and even if it was later, the point is that there is a finite amount of oil, a fossil fuel that takes millions of years to produce. Over time the supply will be drying up but the demand will be increasing as more people are born, therefore the pricer per barrel, for example, would go up.",0

Every week or so I make a couple of trades on this stock to flip down my average cost down a few cents - it nets me several hundred a week pretty consistently.  Today, I was prepared to exit and scalp 10 cents on the second leg, but one look at that EXTREME narrowing of the bollinger bands, together with the positive market direction today, I got back in almost immediately.  On level 2s, there were 5x as many on the ask, but the price was simply not moving.

16-03-02,48jk01,Thoughts on Individual Savings Bonds? Specifically Series EE and Series I Bonds?,"Does anyone here have experiences with Series EE and/or Series I Bonds? I'm 29 and definitely looking at least 30 years into the future, and these bonds look a lot better to me than any other bonds or Bond ETFs out there. If you hold Series EE bonds for 20 years, for instance, [you get basically 3.5%](http://www.forbes.com/sites/marcprosser/2012/03/22/how-to-earn-3-5-on-a-us-savings-bond-2/#471ec4677416). While you only get 1.64% with Series I Bonds, I like that they're inflation protected and more flexible than Series EE bonds if I need to sell them without taking too much of a haircut.  

For some more context at how I'm thinking of using them. I've got most of my investments in retirement accounts with broadly diversified low cost stock and bond ETFs through betterment (90% stocks / 10% bonds). 

I've started trying my hand independently of that with individual stocks on Loyal3 and Robinhood. I'm not doing poorly with those, but I'm not doing great either. While I'm only investing a small portion of what I have total in individual stocks, I'm starting to feel like I should balance out my purchases of individual stocks with bond purchases as well, maybe at an 75%/25% ratio in part because individual stocks are more risky. 

Since I'm in all of this long-term, I don't see any better options than Series EE and Series I Bonds and am thinking of splitting purchases between them. Researching them more, they almost seem better for the long-term than a the Bond ETFs I'm invested in. Is there something I'm missing?",3

&gt; When a dead retailer walking like Macy’s, which is seeing it’s sales fall and profits crater by 30%, announces a $1.5 billion stock buyback when it already is weighed down with $7 billion in debt, you realize the men running these companies have no common sense or concern for the long-term viability of their companies.

and then TSLA: http://seekingalpha.com/article/3896346-real-story-behind-tesla-became-cash-flow-positive

&gt; Management reported a non-GAAP metric called ""core operational cash flow,"" which is a new term. It is neither FCF (free cash flow) by definition or GAAP cash flow from operations. This core operational cash flow includes both cash loss from operations and cash from collateralized borrowings. This term also excludes capex. I have not seen any other company present such a metric. So let's better understand it.

.

&gt; Free cash flow is the concept financial analysts use to estimate the long-term value of a common stock. The free cash flow computation takes into consideration the cash operating income (after-tax) and needed cash outflows to make working capital investments and capital expenditures (or capex). The new metric presented by Tesla as ""core operational cash flow"" does not consider capex. Since Tesla is building the Gigafactory and expanding aggressively, the automaker's capex is very high. Therefore, the ""core operational cash flow"" overstates the cash generating ability of Tesla compared to the traditional free cash flow metric.

.

&gt; Tesla's capex was $1,673 million in FY 2015, up from $990 million in 2014. That takes free cash flow to the red ink zone by far more than $1 billion. Therefore, Tesla is far from being free cash flow positive.

.

&gt; I too have a new definition of ""core cash flow"" for my personal life, and that's ""Salary minus food."" After all, things such as clothing and a warm home are optional, especially in milder geographies. It's a little bit like being an Uber driver and and not counting vehicle maintenance, repairs or depreciation as a cost of doing business.

I hope there will be humble redditors here, that will share names that have ""gray"" cash flow and balances sheet statement. I hope you will be mature enough to not downvote this thing if you are bullish on those names, because actually, here it is where the alpha lay, where you make the big bucks when everything rolls over..",0

16-03-02,48mozc,Help with limit/stop orders while living abroad?,"I'm somewhat of a digital nomad. I've been traveling full time for the past year and a half and plan to continue for another two years. So far, I've been living on savings while finding ways to travel inexpensively (couch surfing, workaways, etc.) But I'm wanting to generate a little income now and I feel like swing trading fits my skill set and knowledge base really well. But here is my question:

I'm 13 hours ahead of EST and thus cannot trade during market hours. So my main strategy while swing trading is setting limit and/or stop orders before the market opens for the day. However, after doing some paper trading practice with ToS, I've discovered a problem: The market is so volatile with bid/asks at the opening bell. If I set a pre-market stop loss to preserve profit that I've made on a position, it is almost immediately filled at 9:30am; even though the current price hasn't even come close to my stop loss. 

For example: I buy ABC at 10.45. On Monday, it goes to 11.15. On Monday night, I set a stop loss at 11.00 to preserve my profit in case it drops. Tuesday morning ABC begins trading at 11.20, but my stop loss triggers at 11.00. I'm assuming it is triggered as the bid/ask spread closes in towards 11.20 after being so far apart pre-market. But I'm not sure. Either way, ABC goes up to 11.40 and I miss out on all those gains.

Is there anything that I can do to set a limit or stop order to begin later in the day? Are there any good strategies that you guys implement in terms of setting pre/post market limit or stop orders? 

Thanks for any help you can provide!",4

16-03-02,48mu0u,Seems so simple but I can’t seem to find an answer: HOW do I contribute to the Traditional IRA I just opened at my bank? Make cash deposits? Transfer from my checking? Have my employer put part of my paycheck in it?,"If this question doesn't fit in the sub, or if it belongs only in the Moronic Monday thread, please let me know and I'll remove it. 

I have a 401(k) and Roth IRA through my employer, with a large pension investment firm. But I decided to open a Traditional IRA though my bank. So now it’s open and has a small amount of money in it that I added when I started it… but how do I contribute more regularly? I think Traditional IRAs are supposed to be pre-tax  - would my employer be the one to set up the pre-tax contributions, if I give them the IRA account number? That doesn’t seem likely to me, I've never heard from them that they would do that for us.

I apologize profusely for this newbie question, it seems so easy but as I said, I can’t seem to find the answer anywhere. Thanks in advance.

I've been currently doing some reading on understanding investing, i.e. bonds, stocks, index funds, ETFs,  and mutual funds. 

Currently I want to invest about 10K in ETFs with this allocation

* 20% VCN - Vanguard Canadian All Cap
* 40% VUN - Vanguard American All Cap
* 10% VRE - Vanguard Canadian REIT
* 20% XEF - iShares International ETF
* 10% VAB - Vanguard Canadian Bonds


With the other 10K I want to invest in individual stocks, but need some recommendations on the ones I've selected.

PSX - Phillips 66, has a 10 P/E, posts good profit margins, with a good dividend. Doesn't look like it'll slow down any soon.

WDC - Western Digital, has a 10 P/E, fairly low for a tech company but I feel it's a good buy low opportunity. The stock has decreased from $120 to $40 even though it's profits have slightly decreased. Could be good buy low.

NVDA - Nvidia has a good 30 P/E ratio for a tech company, has a good chance to grow i believe with its foot entrenched in ton of markets (mobile, desktop, robotics, automation etc).  Sales have also increased yearly.

CHD - Church and Dwight fought right through the recession in 2008 and have posted great profits for years. Could be a good company to just keep for a long time? 

Lastly, I'm looking to either use Questrade or Virtual Brokers. Does anyone have a recommendation of which would be better with just 20K?

Anyways, I'm looking for recommendations as well as critiques for this portfolio. I know people would say that the max you should put into stocks is around 10 percent, but I'm looking to also have more risk for more reward. I'm fairly young at 24 and losing some of this money in the end wouldn't be the worst as at my age I feel it'll be a good learning experience!

So I got a form from her asking me to fill out for her, and it seems like her company is partnering with some investing firm to handle their employees 401k money

But here is what she told me, judging from the reports that her colleagues received from the firm, it looks like they are not very good aka always losing money

So what my mom wants to do is do 401k for the duration of my sister university and then take the money out for 20% penalty (besides letting some stranger handle her money and losing them she also afraid that the age you can be able to use the fund will increase)

Now, it just so that I also buy stocks, but I don't know much about 401k, if I want to handle her funds for her what kind of processes have to go through with her company, and whatever report I might need to handle with the government etc?

Secondly, I know I can just buy index funds and let it sit for years, but before she reach the age to be able to use the fund, it is still 20+ more years, so in the end it would cost me a lot of time to manage?

What are other options she has in this case?

http://i.imgur.com/xfPyakZ.png

I've never seen bollinger bands that tight on a stock I own.

Traded like it was fucking stopped from between 12 to 1:30, and then at 2 pm, a thunderous rally to end the day at .939

I originally gave DD on this stock back when it was at .78, though my average cost of entry was well under that.  I just hope some of you came along for the ride.  Best news is that the major announcements - VADIS trial start, Neuvax P3 Interim report, partnerships - haven't hit yet.  If it consolidates at this range and pushes over $1, not only will it negate the 30-day deficiency notice but there'll be institutional money flying in.  I think that is doable with the near-term catalysts.

Basically in lockstep. While the dollar rises. Oh, look, they all happen to be bottoming at once. This is not a fucking coincidence! Is everyone afraid of talking about macro currency issues, for fear of sounding like a gold bug?

We are seeing a possible long-term dollar reversal right now. Even if it is not a secular trend, it will still cause gold, oil, fertilizer, etc, etc to rise significantly. Yes, oil oversupply helped cause this, **but so did the whole world being in the shitter compared to the US**. Even if oil inventories stay high, as long as they don't continue to rise significantly, the US market decline, and therefore dollar decline, should keep pushing commodities up. The US market uptrend strengthening the dollar, China slowing down purchases, AND shitloads of oil coming online AT THE SAME TIME were what pushed ALL commodities down. US market reversal, China currency decoupling*, oil companies finally going bankrupt, and oversold conditions means there is a strong undercurrent pushing commodities companies up over the medium term. Maybe people aren't talking about this because it seems impossible given a rising rate environment, but I think the general multi-year trend reversing can overcome even modest rate increases.

At least, this is what I hope is happening b/c I own a shitload of commodities stocks. So hopefully I'm not just rationalizing all of this. But I think we're seeing at least a one or two year volatile increase for them. I've got like 20 limit orders set to buy on dips ATM.

16-03-03,48rbcq,DD: Actinium Pharmaceuticals (ATNM),"I originally found out about ATNM from this sub, but it hasn't been talked about in a while, so I'd take the opportunity to DD it.

Actinium had an impressive run up to $3+ bucks a share last December, but the recent bio sector panic knocked them down hard.  It closed yesterday at $2.05.

Disclosure:  I originally got in close to $2, rode the wave to 3, bought more, and got stuck bagholding when it got kicked back to where it started.  However, I remain thoroughly bullish on this stock.  Allow me to explain why.

ATNM is entering into what I call the doldrums phase where there's very little news coming out since everyone is waiting on the results of Phase 3 before commercialization.  It's a perfect time for retail investors to get jittery and vacate their holdings.  The company, though, has no major financial issues at the moment (no debt and enough cash to be fine to mid-2017), and they've just started recruiting for their Phase 3 Iomab-B trials, which is likely to be filled by Q3 of this year.  Unlike other cancer trials, though, we can expect a fairly quick readout of results in 2017, and, if everything goes well, a BLA filing / partnership / buyout by then.

What is Iomab-B and why am I so confident in its success?  Iomab-B is a targeted radiotherapy that uses monoclonal antibodies to deliver a tiny bit of actinium-225 to target cells, frying them but keeping non-target cells safe.  This can be considered a breakthrough for what Iomab is trying to treat - acute myeloid leukemia.  Standard treatment protocol for AML calls for a bone marrow transplant, but in order to get a marrow transplant, the diseased, cancerous bone marrow has to be destroyed first.  Usually this is done with whole-body radiation, and yes this is as terrible as it sounds.  Many patients who are older with other existing medical conditions do not meet the health criteria for whole-body radiation are SOL.

Until Iomab, which targets bone marrow and keeps collateral damage to a minimum.  Iomab offers a whole category of patients an opportunity to get a life-saving bone marrow transplant whereas before they had nothing.  It's the choice between treatment and no treatment.  Even if Iomab demonstrates flaws and lower than expected effectivenss, it is still going to be guaranteed to be more effective than sitting around and waiting to die.  Actinium's current trial will have nearly all the cards stacked in its favor.

Phase 2 results histogram:
http://www.actiniumpharma.com/wp-content/uploads/iomabbgraphnew.gif
2-year survival of 19% w/Iomab vs 0% w/standard chemo in patients over 50.  What % improvement is that?  Oh yeah, CANNOT DIVIDE BY ZERO.

The play here is a long one, obviously, but there are a few near-term catalysts to watch out for.  First is the possibility of orphan drug designation by the FDA, which, if it comes, will land this month or next month.  Treating a hitherto untreatable group of patients that is a segment of a much larger population of patients seems like the kind of thing the FDA's orphan drug program is meant to speed through.

Another catalyst to watch out for in the upcoming months is the initiation of the phase 2 study for Actimab-A, which is ATNM's first line therapy candidate for ATNM.  This will also be likely to be stacked in ATNM's favor - in an initial Phase 1 study, they tested a cohort of 14 patients who were over 60 and were too sick to receive even standard chemotherapy.  4 of the 14 patients managed to achieve remission after one cycle.  Actimab has been designated an orphan drug by the FDA.

16-03-03,48s0sa,Yahoo - Bill Ackman is getting obliterated,"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/bill-ackman-getting-obliterated-234544424.html

Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, founder of $13 billion Pershing Square Capital, is having another devastating year.

Pershing Square Holdings, his fund's publicly traded vehicle, has fallen 19.9% through the end of February, according to a performance update.

Ackman, a well-known activist investor, makes large, concentrated bets in a handful of companies. This year, the majority of his long positions have collapsed, while his only short bet has surged.

His returns in February were largely dragged down by Valeant Pharmaceuticals' massive decline and Herbalife's big spike on Friday.

On February 29, the last trading day of the month, Valeant confirmed that its part in several ongoing investigations, including ones by the US Attorney's Offices for Massachusetts and the Southern District of New York and the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

The stock collapsed 18.44%, or $14.87, to close at $65.78 per share on Monday.

Pershing Square is the largest hedge fund shareholder of Valeant, with more than 21.5 million shares. Since taking a position in the first quarter of 2015, the fund has lost more than $2 billion — on paper — on its position.

In contrast, Herbalife, the fund's only short bet, surged in February. The stock gained more than 18% over the month. On Friday, the company said in a filing that it's in talks with the Federal Trade Commission.

For more than three years, Ackman has been crusading against Herbalife, a multilevel marketer that sells nutritional shakes and weight-loss products. In late December 2012, Ackman publicly declared that he was short $1 billion worth of Herbalife.

He believes that the company is operating as a ""pyramid scheme"" that targets poor people. It's his contention that regulators, specifically the FTC, will shut the company down. In March 2014, the FTC opened an investigation into the company. Herbalife has always denied Ackman's allegations.

In his fourth-quarter investment letter that he published in late January, Ackman intimated that he would be sticking by his positions. Here's a rundown of how they have performed this year/last month:

Valeant (VRX): -35.27% YTD / -27% MTD
Platform (PAH): -44.74% YTD / -7% MTD
Fannie Mae (FNMA): +4.88% YTD /  +29% MTD
Freddie Mac (FMCC): +2.47% YTD / +26% MTD
Canadian Pacific (CP): -5.02% YTD / +1.22% MTD
Howard Hughes (HHC): -18% YTD / -2.36% MTD
Restaurant Brands International (QSR): -8.25% YTD / +0.36% MTD
Air Products &amp; Chemicals (APD): +1.81% YTD / +4.55% MTD
Zoetis (ZTS): -14.32% YTD / -4.62% MTD
Mondelez (MDLZ): -9.61% YTD / -o.56% MTD
Last year, Pershing Square suffered its worst year in its history, losing 20.5%.

16-03-03,48sx4f,Interesting Stock of the Day: HRTG,"I've screened out a stock that I might purchase a few shares of before the day's out. It's a property &amp; casualty insurance company with a market cap of ~$600 Million. According to Finviz, it's ttm P/E ratio is ~6.5 and it's 1-Year-Forward P/E is ~6.2. The company evidently has ZERO debt, and even a dividend to boot, although it's only about a ~1% yield. 

What brought it to my attention is all of the positive characteristics described above as well as it's over-selling of about -10% today alone due to an earnings report coming out today. The stock price currently sits at about $17.80/share, and although several insiders have sold relatively recently, they all sold north of $22/share.

I'm thinking of buying a few shares now, buying more if it goes further down, and selling at about $20/share. Thoughts?

I'm using this market drop as an opportunity to start building a position in SunTrust, and I think others should do the same.

The company has a large base of assets (98% of which aren't in the energy space), and these assets are being used highly efficiently to generate returns for investors. Management has reacted well to control risky energy loans on its balance sheet, and is focused on improving efficiency even further.

With ties to the Fed, a strong geographic presence in the Southeast, and prices that trade below the value of its assets, I'm finding STI to be more attractive as the market selloff continues each day. Q4 earnings came out before the market opened on January 22nd, and the company reported a beat on both the top and bottom line.

16-03-03,48timb,What is the long term situation of a 3x ETF?,"I know these securities are inherently unstable and if the price drops they will keep splitting shares and re balancing so you lose even more money. 

But then I saw this:  http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=TQQQ+Interactive#{""range"":""max"",""allowChartStacking"":true}

And realized that if someone bought TQQQ in 2010 they could have made up to 900% by now.

16-03-03,48u83a,Thoughts on Oil,"Personally I think it will dip very low again, perhaps below 30. Production needs to decrease and for that to happen the price has to be low enough for long enough that some players fold. This is a dead cat bounce and /CL is struggling to break 35 despite very large players bailing it out whenever it dips low. I've been seeing the gigantic orders that came in like clockwork to pump the price up from 34.30 and I'm skeptical how much longer that can continue. There is massive downward pressure on oil despite this(these?) very large pumper buying up cheap contracts. 

Just today when WTI was slipping to 34.20 and below a massive buyorder pumped it back up, then another pumped it further, then more later in the day.

At the end of the day there were a number of gigantic buy order spikes that were clearly meant to bring it above 35 to keep the bulls roaring. Those were all beaten back by almost equivalent sell order pressure when the price spiked.

Oil seemed to be rising slightly with SPX but when SPX dipped low, oil dipped even lower and when SPX rose, oil didn't rise as much. The end result is that WTI barely stayed stable despite some very clear attempts to pump the price up. I'm betting on another huge drop by next friday, I just don't know when so I'm more than happy bagholding DWTI so I don't miss the train.",1

Read over it, thought it was interesting so I figured I'd share, also first post so give me tips/pointers if you have any.
Highlights I found interesting:

""now with quantitative easing and negative interest rates, the concept of nurturing credit seems to have morphed into something destructive as opposed to growth enhancing. Our global, credit based economic system appears to be in the process of devolving from a production oriented model to one which recycles finance for the benefit of financiers. Making money on money seems to be the system’s flickering objective. Our global financed-based economy is becoming increasingly dormant, not because people don’t want to work or technology isn’t producing better things, but because finance itself is burning out."" 
(1st paragraph)

""Private sector savers are growing leery of debt piled upon debt and government regulators have begun to build fences against further rampant creation. In addition, the return offered on savings/investment whether it be on deposit at a bank, in Treasuries/ Bunds, or at extremely low equity risk premiums, is inadequate relative to historical as well as mathematically defined durational risk."" 
(2nd paragraph)

""The recent collapse in worldwide bank stock prices can be explained not so much by potential defaults in the energy/commodity complex, as by investor recognition that banks are now not only being more tightly regulated, but that future ROE’s will be much akin to a utility stock."" 
(3rd paragraph)

""Puerto Rico follows Detroit not just because of overpromised benefits but because they cannot earn enough on their investment portfolios to cover the promises."" 
(4th paragraph)

""government policymakers seem to be setting up future roadblocks for savers. There is a somewhat suspicious uniform attack on high denomination bills of global currencies. Noted economists such as Larry Summers; respected journalists such as the FT’s Gillian Tett, central bankers such as Mario Draghi – all seem suddenly concerned that 500 Euro or 10,000 Yen Notes are facilitating drug dealers and terrorists"" 
(5th paragraph)

""And that’s not the end of it. If negative interest rates fail to generate acceptable nominal growth, then the Milton Friedman/Ben Bernanke concept of helicopter money may be employed. How that could equitably be distributed nationally or worldwide I have no idea"" 
(6th paragraph)

""The secret in a negative interest rate world that poses extraordinary duration risk for AAA sovereign bonds is to (1) keep bond maturities short and (2) borrow at those attractive yields in a mildly levered form that provides a yield (and expected return) of 5-6%"" 
(2nd to last paragraph)

""no guarantees""

16-03-04,48w0wo,HRTX - Make $450 per month with no money down,"What! $450 per month? How?

HRTX is waiting for FDA review on Sustol. Latest news today suggests that it will be early - mid April before news.

There is very limited risk that this won't be approved, but the market doesn't like uncertainty so the stock price is getting beaten down.

HRTX was trading at $30 in Dec,and is now around $17.50.Remember this number.

The review date for SUSTOL has been delayed several times, and there has been a couple of news items in the last 2 weeks, each time he SP has fallen from 18 ish to 16, and back to 18 the same day.

Yeah, but what is this $450.

So, with limited risk,it is a very good time to SELL PUTS.
A 17.50 strike in April nets $450 per contract. Which is a very good premium. (If you know of better premiums, please let me know!) As the April date gets closer, I'm confident that the stock will rise and either you can buy back your PUT for a lower cost, or ride it out and likely collect the full premium.

I have done this for March - Sold Put @ $400 per contact, I can now buy it back for around $175, but I'm going to ride it out.

I have also sold several PUT contracts for April, which I may buy back, or ride out.

I'm happy to buy this stock if I do get exercised, I was considering buying when it was $16 last week, but by selling PUTS, if I was exercised, I'd be paying around $13 per share.

16-03-03,48txn3,Thoughts on $WEN?,"After reading their 10K today, I enjoy the way the direction that the company is going. My biggest take aways from this are...

1. Reducing the amount of company stores and increasing franchised stores. McDonalds definitely jumped on this boat a lot faster than other restaurants did, and now look at their stock. Looking at Wendy's 10K, it seemed interesting that even though their sales dropped (1.61B -&gt; 1.44B), their profits increased (121M -&gt;161M). Franchising seems to work well in general.

2. Making international Wendy's franchise more luxurious than a simple fast food restaurant. You guys will  probably grill me for this, but this is coming from personal experience. I go back to China to visit my relatives and when I see all the fast food restaurants there (Pizza Hut,  KFC, McDonalds), they're a lot nicer than the ones in the US... and the lines are literally out the door every day. Part of selling American food in foreign countries is to make it American more appealing than it actually is.

* **Here's how YOUR company is making money right now:**
* Last 12 months sales = about $17.8 Billion
* Profit margin = 20.6%
* Profit from last 12 months = $3.7 Billion (pretty awesome!)


* So you paid $312 Billion for a company that made you $3.7 Billion last year.
* It'll take you about 89 years to earn your investment price back, which means 89 years to double your investment since you'll have the company AND 89 years of profit. 
* That's about 0.8% annual return for 89 years to double your investment -- awesome!
* BUT if Facebook revenue totally doubles in the next 12 months, it'll only take you 44.5 years to double your investment (for a 1.6% annual return).
* And if FB's revenue doubles twice in the next 24 months, it'll only take you 22.25 years to double your investment (for a whopping 3.2% annual return).
* If FB's revenue doubles three times in next 36 months, your investment will double in a mere 11 or 12 years (for a stellar 6.4% annual rate of return)


* Is FB's revenue going to double in next 12 months to $35.6 Billion (and about $7.12 Billion profit)?
* Will it double again after that to $71.2 Billion (and about $14.2 Billion profit) in the next year?
* Then will it double again for the third consecutive year to $142.4 Billion (and about $28.5 Billion profit)?


If it does this, your purchase price of $312 Billion for all the stock today will double in about 11 years for a annualized return of about 6.4%.


=====


Contrast Facebook's market price today (the price of owning all the shares at today's closing price) with another high flying tech company, such as Apple:


* Apple's market price for owning all the stock today: $562.8 Billion
* Apple's last 12 months of sales (revenue): $236 Billion (vs FB's $17.8 Billion)
* Apple's profit margin: 22.9% ($54 Billion Profit each year)
* Years to double your investment with the current revenue level (without having to double revenue): about 10.4 years 


===


CONCLUSION


Facebook's upside is better because it'll take 3 consecutive annual doublings of revenue just to make it reasonable to double your investment within 11 or 12 years. (FB's revenue just increased 50% instead of 100% last year, so it only fell short by 50% of that goal). It's a great deal to spend $312 Billion for a company that's already been around over 10 years and currently earns a whopping $3.7 Billion a year in profit. Just the other day I spent $312,000 for local restaurant that's be around 10 years and made a whopping $3,700 in profit last year -- I'm psyched! They have the best french fries and ketchup (fresh frozen!). I just have to sit back and watch my $312,000 make me $3,700 each year! It doesn't get any better than that.


GrandmaBook, I mean Facebook, is a growing awesome brand that pulled in a whopping $3.7 Billion profit in the last 12 months, haters. There's really no price too high to buy such a great company. No other conclusion can be reached (unless you grasp basic arithmetic, then the fair price for owning Facebook is between $30-$36 per share, about a third of its current price; and even then it wouldn't compare favorably with some other tech high flyers; so really $15-$20 a share is a solid price for a *stagnant* FB). Basic arithmetic is for losers, anyway! Did you ever see a lottery winner worry about math? And each each year a few  winners make hundreds of millions each. Facebook all the way, baby. Start Facebook parties to get your friends and family to  buy Facebook, then get their other friends and family to buy, and so on. (Then sell while that's going on.)

Facebook Target price by 2017: $1,456/share.

*Level 1: Buy Stock, Covered Calls, Protected Puts, Cash Covered Puts, Purchase Options, European Cash Settled Spreads

*Level 3: Debit and Credit Spreads (American style)

*Level 6: Uncovered Options ($4k account balance also).

&amp;nbsp;

They told me to send an email to the customer service email address requesting an options trade level up if I wanted to up my level, so I did. And of course being the nice person I am, I answered all of the questions truthfully. Needless to say I never recieved an email back and after I searched around about what people have done to up their options level I highly doubt OptionsHouse will approve me for at least level 3 trading.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm looking at opening up a TD Ameritrade account (mostly because of the ToS platform) via Dough (for those low commissions) with $10k. I'm not looking to short stock, write uncovered options, or do anything where the potential loss is more than my account. I just want to be able to buy and sell spreads.

&amp;nbsp;

My questions are: 

*what's the consequences if they find out you lied about your net worth, liquid assets, annual income, and options experience (concerned mostly because they can look at my employers info and my age and make a safe bet im not bringing in $100k+ a year)? 

*On the Dough site it says they offer the ""Doughjo"" classes and you can use the certificate to possibly get approved for ""basic permissions to trade options."" What's this get you? Does it even work?",1

16-03-04,48wjot,[OPINION] What will happen if/when Trump becomes president,"After about 7 beers, I came up with this idea like 10 minutes ago. Here's my idea:

Trump says he doesn't have all the corporations in his pocket, but he does have this one big investment buddy-friend, known by some as Carl Icahn. We know Carl and him have been chatting. We know this because a month or two ago, he name dropped Carl after saying something like ""I don't wanna be president when this economic bubble pops. It's going to happen because my homeboi Carl Icahn told me about it."" Carl has also endorsed Trump for president.


Now lets look at Carl. Carl Icahns garbage piece of shit stock ""Icahn Enterprises LP"" $IEP has been floating around in the toilet bowl the last year because Carl thought it was a good idea to invest in everything the retards on WSB have been investing in: Chesapeake, falling knives, energy stocks, etc. This has costed Icahn a yachts worth of money and made him look like a village idiot. Carl needs a rebound.

But Carl knows how to play. He's got the trump card in his pocket, and he's still a billionaire. This will allow him to shovel some cash into The Don pockets. But how will Trump help out Icahn?  I don't know, but maybe by cutting it off from the rest of the oil producing world, or bombing the fuck out of something, going to war, etc, thereby fixing Americas energy sector n shit. This is a win-win for both, because fixing the energy sector will ""make America great again!""

16-03-04,48wjy8,Yahoo plans to sell $1 to $3 billion of its noncore assets,"Speaking at Morgan Stanley's Technology, Media and Telecom conference, Yahoo CFO Ken Goldman says aside from a spinoff of its core Internet business, the company's looking at selling ""non-core assets"" for $1B-$3B.

Those assets include patents and property, and a committee formed to explore alternatives to the spinoff is considering some quick sales of the non-core assets. The company's sold or licensed more than $600M in patents over the past three years.

Yahoo has launched a relatively formal auction process for its search business, with telecoms including Verizon AT&amp;T and Comcast emerging as likely favorites alongside other companies (like longshot Time Inc.) and private equity.

16-03-03,48uogx,3x YOLO 31% leveraged dividend payed monthly.,"**Just when I didn't think the ETF industry could get more any more retarded... It got more retarded.**

&amp;nbsp;

Say hello to MORL. A double leveraged ETF that tracks the MREIT industry. These are mortgage backed securities companies (who buy a fuckton of mortgages on credit and underwrite the risk) that are given a tax status allowing them to operate tax free so long as they distribute 90% of their income in dividends. While this 30% dividend is high, it is not as crazy as you think seeing as 7, 8 and even 10% are not unheard in the MREIT industry. 

If you are uncomfortable with the weirdness of a 30% dividend say hello to CEFL which is a 2x ETF that pays a respectable 17.8%

**And this one is old white man approved so clearly the risk is low ammarite?**

http://seekingalpha.com/article/2115093-17_8-percent-yielding-cefl-diversification-on-top-of-diversification-or-fees-on-top-of-fees

High dividends can also be enjoyed without leverage (this is what I recommend if you actually want to buy something) via business development companies:

TICC 21% 

PSEC 13% (I own this one)

TCAP 15% 

**Note for serious investors**

Because Mreits, BDCs and Reits operate on colossal amounts of leverage the market has decided that they are at risk of losing their profits and becoming unable to pay their dividends when the fed increases the federal funds rate. Some of them also cut dividends when the % of share price gets too high or when earnings are less than expected. 2x investments like MORL take this leverage and magnify it by 2 while also carrying the risk of the SEC shutting them down or being liquidated. 

They also risk slow decline in value.

That being said, dividend yields this sexy will not last forever. The second these securities become safe old white dudes from seeking alpha will buy them (for retirement income) until the yield is like 3% and they cease to be an interesting option for people who actually want to make money. 

Where there is risk there is reward, chose wisely.",51

But the fact that Snapchat wasn't able to get a higher valuation for the company with the sale of these shares is likely to fan worries that the once red-hot period of growth for internet companies is coming to an end.

Ever since then he has been distant. Not only that but it seems like he is into drugs? It seems like he sells quite a lot of them, and he just seems dangerous.

He takes phone calls that he won't tell me about, talks to strange people online, etc. I'm pretty sure he hired a prostitute, I mean we never talked about being exclusive but I think he is cheating on me.

His friend group also changed. I'm not racist, but he has started hanging out with really scary black people. He listens to a lot of rap music, drinks more, uses ""thug"" language, and even bought a gun. 

I guess what I'm asking for is some guidance from people that have been here before. I'd break up but he always says sweet things like ""you're worth ~~750%~~ 5000% more than you think"". It makes me blush.

Strong employment gains were recorded in health care, retail trade, and restaurants.

Meanwhile, manufacturing jobs fell more than expected (-16,000), suggesting that the sector's slowdown is not over. Mining jobs also tumbled.

I would have expected them to simply delay vesting rather than release to keep taxation simple.

Two questions i'd love some advice on. 

1)Does my situation pose tax implications. I'm assuming that my tax basis is based on vest, but then if when they are finally released, the stock is lower, i'll effectively have overpaid tax and need to reclaim it next april. Am i right.

2) Once stock vests, is it mine even though it hasn't been released? Would my company be obliged to release the vested shares should i leave my job?

16-03-04,48yt81,"[RESEARCH] Global oil markets may be beginning to tighten, but US inventories likely continue to rise through 1H’16","#US EIA Petroleum Statistics

##Global oil markets may be beginning to tighten, but US inventories likely continue to rise through 1H’16

**US crude oil production is indeed declining, but inventories may still be building to high levels throughout 1H’16, especially with strong imports in the near-term.** Monthly EIA oil data showed that US crude output fell in December, down 170-k b/d y/y to 9.26-m b/d, and a sharper 350-k b/d y/y decline if not including rising offshore Gulf of Mexico production (see Energy Weekly). This is down 0.4-m b/d since the recent peak of 9.7-m b/d in April 2015.


**Crude oil inventories surged 10.4-m bbls (over Bloomberg survey expectations of a 2.5-m bbl build) to a record high 518-m bbls even as refinery runs picked up, due to an uptick in crude imports, particularly on the West Coast.** However, the adjustment factor also swung 0.7-m b/d in the bearish  direction. This has been particularly choppy on a week-to-week basis, but averaging close to zero since December 2015. The weekly choppiness may now be a feature going forward, implying some sort of logistical froth – backed-up tankers in the Gulf of Mexico? Uneven pipeline flows? Export cargoes? – which might be driving odd timing for data reporting, where numbers for one week might be slipping into the next EIA weekly report. A monthly look at balances may be more helpful for discerning fundamental trends, and weekly numbers are noisy.

**Cushing crude oil inventories rose 1.1-m bbls to another record high of 66.3-m bbls; with some 64.5-m bbls in tanks, this is 88% of working storage capacity of 73-m bbls.** With very high inventory levels in Cushing, outflows to the Gulf Coast are now rising, helping to drive PADD III crude inventories to surge 8.8- m bbls w/w to a record 264-m bbls, though here again, this is hard to explain with EIA data, given that PADD III refinery runs rose 0.2-m b/d w/w to 8.3-m b/d, while imports fell 23-k b/d w/w but remained relatively high at 3.1-m b/d. Given the high number of cargoes headed to the Gulf Coast over the last weeks, it could be that some of these cargoes have been backed-up and are hitting storage tanks in a deferred manner, and/or that data reporting on these imports have somehow been delayed. Meanwhile, Saudi April Official Selling Prices (OSPs) for its crude to the US have been adjusted down, with Arab Light at its lowest since 2012.

**Gasoline demand has rebounded from weaker readings seen earlier this year.** Gasoline inventories fell 1.5-m bbls (close to survey expectations of a 1.1-m bbl draw) as improving demand since the snowstorms has stayed ahead of supply. 4WMA gasoline demand stands at 9.26-m b/d, up a robust 0.6-m b/d y/y.

**But other products aren’t keeping up.** Diesel inventories rose 2.9-m bbls (against survey expectations of a 1-m bbl draw) reversing from the prior week’s draw as refinery supply picked up while apparent domestic demand dropped. 4WMA diesel demand stands at 3.43-m b/d, down 0.78-m b/d y/y. And total crude and product inventories, including the SPR, rose 10-m bbls to a record 2,041-m bbls.

I'm trading short-term positions of $2,000 to $5,000 at a time without any real reason or discipline. I think I just up the ante when I have losses to make up for. Shitty mentality, I know it, I know exactly why it's a gambler's fallacy and yet I keep doing it just because I think I'm really in the right trade this time around.

I never cut my losses quick enough. I go from ""it's just normal fluctuation"" to ""there's support, don't lock in a loss"" without realizing it and the mentality gets stronger the more I keep getting fucked over. I don't have a clear limit most of the time and when I do, I ignore it because ""this time's different.""

Example, today. I grabbed 60 NUGT before yesterday close, 15@61.48. Rolled out of bed late, it was up 13%, Awesome. Let it slip to 11% and sold. Good trade. Now it's a couple hours into trading so I go looking for top movers &amp; solid trends.

LNCO blowing up, I've been watching, saw it hit 1.00 and pull back so I get in 1000@0.8498 based just on momentum and FSTO crossover. Averaging down I take 1000 more at 0.8375 - plan is just to be in and out real quick, close to 0.87ish - didn't go that way so stop loss sold off half at 0.795 and sat on the other half til 0.850. Not horrible, whatever. 

Then I start fucking around trying to get a piece of SDRL when it was teleporting from $4 to $7 midday. In 400@6.48, out 400@6.75. Cool. But shit's still blowing up. Should've pumped in more, should've waited, etc. etc. So right at the FUCKING top I buy 500@7.10 all my STO/RSI/everything is broke as fuck anyway because I figured it's a one-off event and I'd get back in on it. Well at about 5.35 I realized how fucking badly I missed the boat there and jumped out. The whole time I'm thinking because it's so volatile I'll wait for the right exit point to conserve capital, I've accepted a loss at this point but trying to mitigate it. Too greedy.

Not wanting to give up, I pick up 750@5.56 on FSTO/SSTO crossover, EMA crossover, RSI crossover and watch it plummet I think as low as 4.70 - same fucked up mentality, I just kept expecting momentum to build, waiting for short covers. This time it worked in my favor and I sold at 6.30.

Then, since I'm a fucking idiot, I picked back up at 6.55 and sold 6.02.

Anyway I'm just down $1,000 but my trades were fucking awful and even writing this out is cringey. Plus taxes/wash sales gonna hit me too. This was some of my worst fear &amp; greed trading of all time. So what do you do when you know you're fucking up so badly but there's that little voice going ""hey fuck it, it's already screwed to hell, let's wait."" Especially when the voice turns out to be right sometimes. 

Once or twice, it wouldn't bother me. I get it, day trading is volatile. I can stomach losses like these. But they are becoming a regular thing as I get bolder with my trades and I'm not seeing too many trades where it's equally to my advantage. I'm supposed to be getting better, not worse. Any tips? Should I just grow a pair and start trading options so I can lose it all and get it the fuck over with?",20

16-03-05,490b2s,Current market discussion involving the energy sector. SDRL - CHK,"Hi,

I'm rather new to this, and for the first time today figured out what a short squeeze was. In some kind of odd stroke of luck, I've manage to turn $15,000 into $38,000 in about two weeks. Today, i finally got scared and sold everything. I've never invested before and I don't even know what half the things mean on the trading platform.

I guess my question is... how do you feel about the current market? I like I said am new to this, but I keep seeing stocks rise without any real good news. Like SDRL - CHK - OAS - WLL. Yet that didn't stop SDRL from going from $1.80 to $7.40 in just three days. 

I personally felt although the oil production growth was halted by some major open members, there has not been a significant amount of up tick in the actual commodity, or down tick in the supply. To warrant any of this. 

I think CHK will personally be bankrupt before too long, or it would be nice for some type of buyout/merger. 

SDRL - not sure how a person not allowed to buy any more company stock, is expected to bail out a company he started?

WLL -  I really really want to believe in this as I bought in the $3 area... however. I sold this today too.


Is this upswing here to stay? Should i have held on to at least WLL?",3

16-03-05,493066,Basics of ER betting,"Only play ERs on companies you can bet long.

[Companies and analysts revise forecasts throughout the year to make themselves look better] (http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21601290-profits-america-may-have-peaked-cycle-sound-retreat).

Even during this shitty ER season, most companies have ""beat"" [their estimates] (http://lipperalpha.financial.thomsonreuters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/25th-feb.jpg).

For most ER seasons, 60-65% of companies beat their ERs, so if you only try to find companies that you can bet long on, even if your are shitty, you should be averaging nearly 2:1 correct. 

ERs also come with financial updates, which immediately make a company more valuable --&gt; greater clarity = less risk. This is asymmetric information, it cannot be priced in before ER. This is party why micro cap companies with little analyst coverage and little news often have SP drift between ERs--the longer since last ER, the less up-to-date your info. 

Finally, find friendly terrain. Bet on companies that operate in countries/regions that are doing well, in sectors that are doing well, in currency environments that are positive. These factors will give you better odds of having your bae give positive guidance. 

ERs are absolute gambles but you have a lot of factors you can tweak to give yourself better than 50/50 odds. ",51

I deposited $2200 into my account, and took a position with max risk of $1500 (sold a 3 contract call spread, 5p spread). I expected the resulting buying power to be at least $700 (my cash minus risk), possibly more since a credit was taken in when the trade was filled. 

But instead I find my options buying power at zero. Why?",1

16-03-06,49563y,Discussion: Best Fund for each Bond Type,"Hi guys! I wanted to start a thread to discuss good ""non-diversified"" Bond funds. Here's why.

* 1. I'm a believer that efficient frontier/portfolios should be learned by  everyone (not just investors). But as a professional data scientist and modeling hobbiest I also think efficient frontier, markowitz optimization, etc, etc are very misleading and not actually that great.

 * 1.a MVO and risk metrics have weird assumptions, too many parameters to overfit and I feel like there is a lot cherry picking and fooling ourselves. I really don't care what the average correlation of two assets are. I care what their combined performance is during crisis or what their rebalancing opportunities are during low volatility times.

 * 2. I'm a huge hater of market cap weighting. Look at HYG, look at S&amp;P 500 during tech bubble and financial crisis, look at APPL one of my least favorite companies being like 4% of SPY. There are other marketing and low fee tricks that are of a similar vein.
 * 3. if all bonds had a constant negative correlation to stocks we'd all be rich because trading would be stupid easy. However there might be an opportunity to generate rebalancing opportunities in a a portfolio by owning several different bond sectors instead of just owning BND or similar.  Some bonds have a negative correlation to stocks under low volatility like BFK muni. Some have great correlations like TLT but high interest rate risk. Short duration investment grade are good but pretty much require leverage or must be used as purely trading vehicles. I'm hoping we can build a list of lots of sectors and flavours of bonds and rank by fees and ask/bid spreads and other factors. I will definitely be contributing my own lists and I will post some backtesting and results if I find anything good. both ETFs and CEFs are welcome. Happy Discussing/Researching!",11

There seems like a lot of indicators that point to a stock crash/correction, but in the last 100+ years that's never happened with the fed interest rates as low as they are now (not even close).  
http://snbchf.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Longterm-US-Treasuries.jpg

What would prompt a crash if you can't earn money in government bonds? And if there is a crash what's the fed going to do? more QEing, driving up fed assets even higher than they are now? If there is not a crash, correction, I could see sideways trading for many years. Don't see how the market can go up much (any time soon) based on historical valuations and current economic realities.

16-03-06,496qm2,Will Priceline ($PCLN) Bounce Back,"Priceline’s main competition is Expedia ($EXPE).

Priceline is used more for traveling abroad, with 88% of its revenue coming internationally.

Expedia is used more for domestic travel with only 38% of the revenue coming from international travel. This plays an advantage to Priceline in the long term as the world becomes more globalized, and it will give the company more global recognition. 

Europe is a popular travel destination, and emerging markets in the world will only benefit Priceline. One reason why some analysts may favor Expedia is that the U.S. dollar is getting stronger. However, this should be relatively short-lived as currency exchange rates are often cyclical.

My brother and uncle just started an LLC., have bought property and are in the final stages of drafting plans/permitting. They plan on building a structure to house their main business they share (general contractor) plus 6 rental units. I've gone over the numbers on projected rents, vacancy rates, etc. and think they are sound. A realtor also thinks they are sound. The monthly cashflow for the first 10 years is roughly 400/month, at which point the loan is paid off. then it goes to roughly 40K/year per partner (currently there are 2- just my brother and uncle). I need someone here to tell me taking 35K out of my retirement to invest in this is a horrible idea. I know that they will be giving their main business a break in terms of monthly rent, but i see that as the price i pay for security ( I am across the country, and they are all carpenters should something break)


Me:

* 28 year old, stashing away 2.5K/month

* $40K in an IRA retirement fund

* $11K in a brokerage

* 5K in cash reserve account (I dont consider this savings, i just consider it a black hole i cant ever touch)

* No kids, single

* Very little savings (about 2K....i just moved across the country and am just getting on my feet, but the 2.5K/month will be helping very soon).


All i can think about is how i dont need the retirement now and cashing in 35K to get in on this now will pay off in the future. I'm justifying it in my head by saying ""at the rate i can save for retirement, i can have this back to where it was by the time I'm 31 PLUS I'll have rental income"".

16-03-06,498chi,On the Importance of seeing for yourself,"In last weeks Barron's, [they ran a column which highlighted 5 ""defensive"" dividend payers that they thought ""are expected to cover their robust dividends.""](http://www.barrons.com/articles/the-dividend-defense-1456549337?tesla=y&amp;mod=BOL_archive_twm_mw) Decided to check them out. As expected, not exactly as ""robust"" as one would imagine.

As dividends (and buybacks) are cash expenses, they should be paid out from operating free cash flow. For this purpose, I'll define OFCF as:

- Net Income 
- + Depreciation and Amortization
- + Non-recurring Special charges
- - CapEx &amp; Acquisitions

(Yes, I don't account for working capital changes) Thus for a company to maintain its dividend, one would like to see the Payout ratio (Dividends/OFCF) at around 50%, give or take. I also looked at their Total Payout Ratio (Dividends + NET Buybacks/OFCF), as buybacks are another way of returning cash to shareholders. Finally, I checked out an Augmented Payout Ratio (Dividends + Net Buybacks + NET debt retirement/OFCF), as this seems to be the best indicator regarding shareholder return.

The first number is the current dividend YIELD, followed by dividend payout, total payout, and augmented payout ratios:

- LVS: 6.1, 145%/153%/194%
- IP: 5.1, 28%/53%/65%
- WDC: 4.6, 34%/60%/50%
- AES: 4.4, 128%/267%/157%
- EMR: 3.9, 29%/85%/80%
- AAPL: 1.87, 22%/90%/46%

Clearly LVS and AES aren't exactly ""robust,"" whereas the other 3 have more room to maneuver. And before someone points out that a company could be issuing debt to pay for its shareholder return policy, I've included AAPL's numbers as a comparison.

TL;DR: At least check the numbers yourself.

16-03-07,499wo1,Vanguard strategy: indexed mutual funds vs life strategy funds,"Hi,

Following Bogleheads, I have been buying VTI (50%) and VEU (50%) with my savings for past few years. I am too tired of doing this manually on a daily basis. Now, I am thinking of investing further in mutual funds instead. I have enough bond holdings and personal savings in FDIC-insured accounts that I don't really need a bond component. 

1. Invest in VTSMX and VGTSX 50:50. So, say, buy 100$ worth of each every day, this ensures ~50, 000$ invested every year in my taxable accounts.

2. The other strategy is to buy a life strategy fund line 2050 or 2055 retirement fund (I am young). They might be tax inefficient but it is passive and adjusts for my age over time.

Any thoughts on 1 vs 2?

The Yolo Play:
REFR is suing E-Ink over Patent Nos. 6,606,185 and 5,463,491. Suit began over two years ago, and no news except that E-Ink's first attempt to swat the suit [failed] (http://www.natlawreview.com/article/e-ink-corporation-v-research-frontiers-incorporated-decision-denying-institution-ipr). 

Full disclosure, I don't know shit about patent law. Like, not even a little. My only reason to think resolution of lawsuit maybe around the corner is [this] (http://www.inventionstatistics.com/Duration_of_Patent_Lawsuits_Litigation_Length.html) which states:

&gt;2 - 3 years.  Length of time it takes for the average patent case to be litigated.  “An average patent case will cost between $3 million and $10 million, and take two to three years to litigate.” Average duration of patent litigation.  (Sylvia Hsieh, “More patent cases are being taken on contingency fee basis,” Lawyers USA, August 14, 2006)


The [fun part] (http://www.smartglass.com/news/research-frontiers-files-patent-infringement-lawsuit-against-amazon-barnes-noble-e-ink-and-sony/) about the law suit though is:

&gt;Research Frontiers does not expect its share of the costs associated with this litigation to be material to its overall operations because it has entered into a contingency agreement with Niro, Haller &amp; Niro which greatly reduces its exposure to the costs associated with the prosecution of this litigation.

$REFR has is claiming $90 million in development costs alone in the suit--I cannot find a firm number for the total amount they are suing for. However, even if they only get a fraction, its going to be very meaningful for a company with a mkt. cap of ~100m.

I realize that the Ex-Dividend date is 3/9/2016. Dividend payouts decrease the stock value (mostly) and ideally I probably won't benefit at all from buying the stock before the date. However, would after the ex-dividend date be a good idea? ",9

The company, London-based AlgoDynamix Ltd., has attracted both investors and customers since its founding on 2013 on the strength of its potential and its technology, which seeks “clusters” of telling market activity and alerts clients when it’s found them.

The claim is dramatic — what investor wouldn’t want to foresee the worst downward moves? It’s also one other companies have struggled to back up, with many market experts saying reliably anticipating big market movements is difficult if not impossible.

But the company touts recent successes, including alerts in December and January that preceded slumps.

16-03-07,49b4j2,Thoughts on these portfolios?,"I'm researching portfolio breakdowns and was wondering about /r/investing critique on these.

#1 Swenson's Lazy Portfolio (70/30)


30% US Stock Market

20% Reits

15% International Developed

5% Emerging Markets

15% TIPS

15% 5-Year T-Bills

#2 3 fund (60/40) small cap/ emerging tilt

30% Small Cap Value

30% Emerging Markets

40% Long-term Government bonds


As an experiment, I threw together a couple funds that combines some of the ideas of these two.

#3 emerging/small cap tilt mix

20% small cap value

20% emerging markets

20% REIT

40% Bonds

#4 somewhat more diverse

15% small cap value

15-20% total stock market

15% emerging markets

10-15% REIT

40-45% bonds

The performance seems fairly strong, but I was wondering what the caveats of these strategies are. The small/emerging tilt seems beneficial in most time periods, and there is the french/fama research giving it some credibility. Adding a bit of total market as in number 4 seems to drop the SD without affecting the return too much. Thanks for your thoughts

16-03-07,49d8ro,Can robo advisers replace human financial advisers?,"Do investors need people anymore?

The past few years have seen the rise of robo advisers, a category that includes not only fully automated investment services and advice but also “hybrids” that pair computerized services with hand-holding from human advisers. The firms generally offer passive investments, as opposed to the active management that a human adviser can provide, but they charge much slimmer fees.

Robo advisers have been making aggressive moves lately, slashing the minimum balance required for an account; some have eliminated minimums entirely. Meanwhile, some big investment firms have begun offering hybrid services or are experimenting with fully automated offerings.

16-03-07,49e7x5,How to retire early off an oil recovery.,"**Introducing the MLP (master limited partnership)**

MLPs are companies that are allowed to operate tax free provided they distribute 90% of their income as dividends to shareholders.  MLPs are the BDCs/REITs of the oil space and as you can imagine they are getting butt-blasted by the falling oil prices. This has annihilated their share prices and pushed their yields into erection causing territory. 

**how to get this action**

First, your fundamentals. Do you believe that oil will recover (to around $60-80?) If not, leave this page, if yes keep reading: 50,000K in a robinhood account becomes 100,000k with margin. Invest this 100k into an oil MLP. 

**Examples**

&amp;nbsp;

BBEP: 80%  (stock jumped 70% today)

&amp;nbsp;

AHgP: 20% 

&amp;nbsp;

CEQP: 67.99%  

&amp;nbsp;

GEL: 10% (recommended. 11 years of consecutive uninterrupted dividend growth, unheard of for such a high yield) http://www.dividend.com/dividend-stocks/basic-materials/oil-and-gas-pipelines/gel-genesis-energy-lp/

&amp;nbsp;


**Results**

For the short term, assuming your yolo is correct and oil prices return to a sustainable level you will reap massive capital appreciation upwards of 500% as these penny stocks surge to their book value prices.  For the long term you will literally receive up to 80%+ of what you put in (160% if you used margin) for the rest of your life.

Stay thirsty my friends. 

http://www.dividend.com/dividend-stocks/mlp-dividend-stocks.php

**Note**
These are not leveraged securities, these are real stocks and they do not degenerate. I am not yet long any of these positions because I do not think oil is recovering in the next 2 years. Probably will invest after the 2016 recession.

Pearson's a smart fellow and I'm glad to see him coming back. I think the lions share of negativity surrounding Canada's largest company has been overblown, and the stock is quite sold-off at these levels. Revenues and earnings are not likely to be drastically decreased this year, and with so much institutional money (and now, very high short interest) this is just a short-squeeze bomb waiting to explode. The double bottom from $59.xx yesterday bounced hard on volume confirming a short-term end to the down trend. At a minimum, expect this to trade sideways (if not up) from here until earnings. Share price was at $80 before they announced delayed earnings, and today when earnings date was announced it only gained to about 65. With so much negativity, the earnings report is going to have to miss heavily for this *not* to surge back in to the 100's. I'm positioned heavily to take advantage of this moving forward. No stop on my calls, but my shares have a stop just below the recent double bottom (which also happens to be 52wk low).",4

As the S&amp;P crept up this morning I opened a very bold 10 Mar 17 199/202 bear call spread for $1.50.  That means I have a $1,500 potential gain and loss, depending on direction.


Other spread users - what are your strategies during the holding period?  Do you set a sort of cut-off for the underlying to salvage a position prior to expiration?  I was looking at NFLX, and if it continues it's rocket decline off of a gay anal(yst) note I might try closing the short position then trading the long PUTs to my advantage.

16-03-08,49hzz1,"Probability of a US recession in 2016 &gt; 60%","There is a significant and reasonable debate over the possibility that the US economy could enter a recession in 2016. It is certainly not very frequent to see such a negative start to the year in equity markets in the midst of a bull market and a growing economy. However between the bearish warnings of Jim Rogers, who recently claimed that the probability of a recession within the next 12 months was 100% and the ""nothing to see here, everything is fine"" of official spokesmen there is a great deal of latitude for reasonable interpretation.

The base probability of a US economy being in a recession (2 consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth) is 20% (11 recessions from 1950-2010). However the probability is significantly higher after 6 consecutive years of growth. US GDP has been growing since Q3 2009 so a slowdown is more likely in 2016 than it was in the past few years. The quarterly slowdown in GDP growth since Q2 2015 (+3.9% annualised growth) to Q4 2015 (+1%) also combines with plunging commodity prices and other negative signals. These factors combined probably raise the chances of a recession in 2016 to 40-50%.

For a recession to happen in 2016 we would need to see negative growth at the latest in Q3 2016 and very low growth in Q2. Early indicators of this would be slowing Industrial Production and Factory orders in the first few months of the year. Lower equity markets are also usually a leading indicator. A slowdown in the services sector should also start to appear. 

A stronger US Dollar is sometimes a confusing indicator as it can indicate weakness elsewhere and relative US economic growth, however it does also almost always coincide with a weaker economy as funds flow from equities and risk assets to the relative safe haven of fixed income and money market funds. Rising interest rates are also very often a precursor to a recession, although lag can vary from a couple of quarters to over a year.

The Conference Board LEI (leading indicators index) declined in January 2016 after many months of growth.

All these numbers would suggest the beginning of a slowdown and a probability of US recession in 2016 higher than 60%. Q1 2016 GDP and Industrial production numbers, should they show accelerating economic weakness, would raise this probability to 70%. Industrial Production numbers for February (out on March 16th) will give more advanced warning: a YoY number worse than -1.0% would signal a very high probability of recession.

After the February equity rally the opportunity to open shorts with tight stop-loss levels and a significant downside is clear. The first positions should be opened this week and exposure increased if next weeks data points reinforce the hypothesis. As usual when trying to anticipate the market, stop-loss discipline is a must.

My first clue came in the second verse: 

&gt; ""There’s a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure"" 

This clearly represents the importance of technical analysis with a cautious eye to fundamental and macroeconomic variables.

And in the fourth verse:
&gt; ""And a new day will dawn for those who **stand long**""

This is obviously referencing the 6.5% equity risk premium empirically observed post-WWII and the supremacy of equity bulls in the long run.

&gt; ""Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but **in the long run**,
There’s still time to change the road you’re on."" 

The symbolism of the two directions (long/short) is undeniable. Not content with index fund returns, Heroin Capital's Chief Research Analyst Jimmy Page reaffirms the ultimate superiority of active management over a passive three-fund portfolio.

This leads me to a couple questions:
1: Is it reasonable to compare the expense ratio of an ETF to an Index Fund?

2: How can I better understand the strategy of these two funds to assert they both would be suitable for accomplishing long term growth.

16-03-08,49gryb,I fucked up. Need help with vanguard funds,"so I invested all my savings in a Vanguard VIMAX last summer at peak of market. then after waiting it out till a month ago right before it started to recover I sold and went into VFITX (current value $14000). :/ I also have around $10K in Vanguard Wellington Fund Investor Shares that I havent touched. I always told myself I was just going to leave that money there forever and not touch it, but all this talk about the market a couple months ago freaked me out and made me sell. so what is done is done. loss of around $3000. My question is what funds do you guys recommend for a long term investment? I am usually not very risk averse, but what happened in the last year just fucked with me. I am thinking about putting everything in VTSAX or some target fund and not touching it this time. any advice

Edit: ok. I did make a mistake I know that. I have actually made worse mistakes. Years ago I invested into an international fund when the Greek fiasco started unraveling. Then it kinda coincided with the Japanese earthquake. I rode those loses and after months of loses I still made money after some time by reinvesting the dividends and not selling for some time. I went against my plan this time. I really think it was because of reading too many posts and being pissed about my horrible market timing. I ended up putting it in the vanguard  health care fund. I figure even it it drops it still had a high dividend pay out and over time I ll be fine. I thought about increasing my tsp contribution until I max but that would mean I would have to live off my savings. My income is kinda low. Although I try my best to save a good portion. ",12

The finance industry is a crucial component of the state’s annual tax revenue, contributing about 17.5 percent of the total last year. Wall Street’s health reverberates throughout the city and state economies; profits are on the line for luxury retailers, restaurants, real estate firms and even auto dealers.

I already have a roth 401k but have decided to open up a separate roth IRA as well. I am looking forward to having a more hands on approach with my Roth IRA.

But now what?

As far as trading experience, in college in 2008 I bought stocks that had tanked (oil and banks) and sold for a profit. But aside from that I am an amateur. 

Should I lean towards finding some solid ETFs in sectors I like (water, oil, renewables, biotech, tech) or companies with dividends in each space?

Any thoughts are appreciated!

But I'm not sure how long a separate exchange for weed would last once legalization at the Federal level is implemented - at that point just easier to put it on the NYMEX, CBOT, or the CME.

16-03-08,49l559,Any good tools out there to find penny stocks by criteria?/any stock recommendations based on my theory?,"So i'm investing in a pretty low risk way for the most part, but separately, as a hobby, i have decided to once a month start messing with penny stocks. The idea is that i'm looking for companies in a relevant industry that have been around for a while (10-15 years) that are currently below 4 dollars a share, that have at one point been above 40 dollars a share. I'm also looking for this stock to have been trending up for about a month, even if it is slight. my theory is that big companies sometimes go through dramatic ups and downs and if i can identify and invest minimally in these stocks when they are down, and just leave my money be, i could make a huge return. 

i have tried using some different tools to find this type of stock, but either the tools i have used don't have these criteria, or i dont understand the jargon-y names of the search functions enough to use them correctly. can someone either explain the necessary functions to me, or share with me a tool that can find stocks based on the criteria i have outlined? 

an example of the type of stock i was looking at was Chesapeake energy. It was at 2.86 when i located it, it had been above 66 dollars, and it was trending up. i would have bought it but my robinhood account didnt get approved in time. if you guys have any stocks i should look at that fit in with my criteria, please let me know! thanks in advance!",2

Looking into swing trading since I can't stare at a screen all day. 

Questions for all you swing traders out there:

When setting up a swing trade, what do you guys look for? What indicators give you the feel for the direction of a stock?

For example, looking at AAPL:
The stock has been on a steady rally since 2/24, but has kinda gassed out the last couple of days. Fibonacci levels on a 6 month chart shows resistance at ~$104.50, which we didn't reach. The RSI and momentum is heading downwards. And the next support level, according to the 6mon fib chart, is at ~$100. 

Am I right to assume that APPL is somewhat likely go trend down? 

What else do you guys look at when you're setting up a swing trade? Thanks

16-03-09,49lvqs,Thoughts on Tootsie Roll (TR)?,"I bought into TR on 2/22/16 @ 33.19

Food &amp; candy are some of those industries that will do well no matter what (within reason). This protected me from both the naysayers calling for a total economic collapse as well as insulating me with like-minded individuals who may just be diversifying for a bit of a bear market. The company has a beta of .4, and is on an uptrend. I feel safe in the sector. But I am not buying long term. This is a relatively short term (my initial thought was a month or so) play.

I bought in for a combination of two reasons:

**Short Interest**

Take a look at the amount of [shares shorted](http://i.imgur.com/wPeY2F4.png). Finviz shows that 20% of shares float are shorted. 33M shares outstanding, and an average daily volume of 66,694.

Now, look at the image specifically from April until now. Some ~700,000 stocks have been shorted since then. I say April, because on the [price chart](http://i.imgur.com/w7A5530.png), this is the last time we have seen prices this high. Now, every single one of those shares is losing money. In fact, this is the highest the price has ever been. Every single share shorted is losing money. No way around it. A low daily volume &amp; shares shorted means buying back will cause a comparatively high increase in demand. Maybe the shorts are there for technical reasons, I don't know. The fundamentals seem fine, as revenue is growing. The point is, many shares are shorted and they are being hurt. 

**Breakout**

As we've all heard before, when a company finally hits through some resistance, it has momentum. This was the first time since April the stock closed above 33 dollars, but more importantly it powered through a resistance that had developed since then at around 31.8. The thing had some power. This, combined with the short interest, showed demand is high (and increasing) and supply is probably low (who wants to sell a stock that's making them gains?). 

**Where I sit now**

At the current price of 33.94, and my buying at 33.19, I have made some petty capital gains of about 2%. The company also just passed its ex-dividend date. In addition to a cash dividend of $.09 a share, they gave a 3% stock dividend of TR. This puts me (and other investors) at about 5% gain since the time of my buying. What's really interesting, though, is that the stock did not fall with the dividend (as they are usually priced in). It actually rose. I would hopefully assume this is due to my correct analysis on other factors. But now I am at a cross roads. When do I sell? Will it continue to rise, or should I believe its had its time? 

If I had seen these gains with a complete cash-dividend equivalent, I would have no doubts in my mind and stick to my plan (stay in for another couple of weeks). What I am fearing is that with new shares being added to the market, supply is increased. The dividend is payable 3/29/16, and I am sure there will be a dip (big or small) that day. But what about before? Investors anticipating this new influx of supply and selling off? Investors anticipating this anticipation and selling off even earlier? Etc. I am certainly long on it given a long-enough time period, but there is opportunity cost. I believe I can make more money elsewhere rather than waiting around after a given dip in the stock. Then again, maybe I should stick to my original plan (which, admittedly, did not forecast the stock dividend.) The month time frame was developed by comparing shares shorted to average daily volume.

Any and all help, or feedback in general, would be appreciated.

16-03-08,49k33g,Placing bets on oil going lower.,"I don't really like making threads with any analysis but so far my oil trades are doing well (cashed out my USO calls and opened both chk &amp; USO puts yesterday) so I'll just jot down my opinions. You faggots can check my wsb posts and see my track record with crude lately if you want.

This is my daily chart (continuous) on crude and my standard chart

http://tos.mx/Ksav2o

http://invst.ly/1ao17

- There was a long term down trend resistance that was not broken and bounced off. On charts that apply fake price movements in rollovers (aka the type of chart most you faggots use), the long term downtrend line was broken resulting in a confirmed double bottom.

- If you look at both the continuous and non-continuous daily chart, both indicate overbought levels on both 14 RSI and stoch.

- For the past year, when the spot blows above the 50dma, it has only managed to top it by ~10-12% once (15%) before getting shut down because crude is fundamentally in a bear market.

- There is a tough resistance line in the 38 -38.50 level. Naturally, wallstreet brought the max pain to scare away weak shorts but it still held.

- How the market reacts to EIA reports, specifically when the report is very bearish (like last week) but the market rallies anyways. This has happened 3 times in the past months, and everytime the market ignores a very bearish EIA report, the rally caps out at around 12-15~ before giving it all away.

- Now on to fundamentals that support the short bet. One of the reasons why oil was up was because some of the Iraqi and Nigerian output was offline due to random shit and that canceled out Iranian output. The Iraqi-turkey pipe is coming back online very soon and the Iranian output will obviously continue to rise (especially when the suez canal is open to usage again). The Nigerian output will also come back since I'm pretty sure they like money.

- American shale. They implied that 40 is the ""magic"" number in which production is back on. This is counter productive to what saudi wanted to achieve with the freeze, they want marketshare and can/will borrow enough money to obtain it.

I think oil is going back to the low 30's relatively soon and i'd short oil even if API and EIA reports are bullish. I posted a while back that people are not comfortable shorting at below 27, I feel the same way about going long near 40.

****EDIT: Stop up-voting my thread you faggots, it's seriously making me uncomfortable and rethinking my position.",53

Today I learnt about a forex arbitrage strategy in which you go from USD -&gt; EUR -&gt; GBP -&gt; USD. By doing this trade you can actually make a very small amount of money, but there is no risk involved. 

Someone told me that you can go about making this trade through something like Barclays. But I was wondering if it is possible to make these kinds of trades through something like Bank of America or TDAmeritrade. I have tried to make the trade through TDAmeritrade paper money but they do not seem to have the right conversion from EUR-&gt;GBP in order to make the cycle complete.

From the lovely men that brought you $FATE and the terrible idea of $CPXX (still ongoing, get back to me when I lose 40%), I bring you DVAX. Yes none of you have EVER heard of this stock before and if you have go fuck yourself I called it first.

Here's what the article outlines:

•The company passed a phase 3 trial in January. Yup. Passed it. Stock surged from ~20 to 26 and *lost it all in 7 days*.

•The company amended a collaboration with big-balls AstraZeneca so that $AZN could ACCELERATE it, bypassing a Phase Ib trial (cuz results were gucci) and taking it on financially fully for itself (DVAX still gets money tho, chill, fam) this caused the stock to drop *AGAIN* after being up 25% on the news.

•Points 1 + 1 = 0! The stock is sitting near 52-fucking-week-lows.

So. I did the math. 1+1 = 2, not 0. And transforming those numbers to relevance to the stock (this is a certified 100% legit math equation): 52-week low + $5 for p3 results + $2 for astrazeneca slobbering all over this company's drug = $22

Considering that some fairly significant value businesses are already set or are aggressively moving in the ""software"" direction (see all the unicorns and - at an extreme transformational example - GE), how much of your investment strategy takes positively into account the CIO/CTO and her teams' publicly declared strategies for IT, and/or their actions in this regard (e.g. by monitoring their participation in software and IT technology transformational online forums)? Or - at the opposite end - how much such drastic change in IT directions, probably in association with the type of business making such attempts, make you ""drop and run""? 

EX: looking at an example in the finance industry: on one hand you hear that some IT leadership coming to ALL from PYPL, accompanied by technology &amp; cultural push from the newcomers, could be indicative of a promising future for the former, whereas on the other hand there are opinions of the kind ""runaways from PYPL IT could only destroy a business (ALL), way too traditional to sustain aggressive or misguided IT (software) transformations"". Which way is an ALL investor to go? Or how are such moves reflected on PYPL, from an investment perspective?

Yes, this stock was identified by JBEM many months ago, and yes, in 2016 this stock has been anally penetrated harder than my childhood. Within the past 3 weeks, the company booted their CFO, announced the failure of a phase 2 proof-of-concept trial, and reported a Q4 loss.

Blegh…what a load of trash, am I right? Who’s dumb enough to invest in this filth?

Me. And I’m about to tell your YOLO ass why.

If you step back and look at the company’s fundamentals, you’ll notice not much has changed. Most of what JBEM discovered in his due diligence remains true, and can be found here:

https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!category-topic/jbem777/past-due-diligence-posts/-v2va3-VBOk

I think the market vastly overreacted to the bad news so far this year while forgetting about what’s to come in this company’s small, but very competitive drug pipeline. Combine that with the dismal performance of the entire bio sector in 2016, and you’re left with one hell of a beat up stock. Yesterday marks the company’s 52-week low, and I believe that the opportunity for upside at this point far outweighs the risk of further bad news. The failed P2 trial wasn’t even for one of their flagship drugs, but rather just a compound they were testing in development to see if it warranted more spend. There are some very powerful people invested in this stock, and some exciting trial results that await us in Q2 &amp; Q3: PTSD and Fibromyalgia data, baby.

As for my credibility, I’m just another pleb looking to join the sacred WSB small penis yacht club someday. I try to specialize in stock entry points and identifying companies with strong fundamentals that have been raped unnecessarily (as I can relate). I don’t post regularly, but my track record is respectable. I created a thread 7 months ago called “The time for AVXL is NOW”, and shortly afterwards the stock shot up over 800%.

16-03-09,49ofyl,"Need help picking an REIT, and relevant details","  I have a bit of cash saved up, and I want to invest in something that pays a lot in dividends. REITs seem to be a very stable, very good dividend-paying option. I've narrowed my choices down to STWD and TWO, paying 10% and 13% respectively. 


  STWD has a yearly low of 16.69, yearly high of 24.79, and currently sits at 18.13. Pre-2012, it has been at a lower price. I like STWD because I've read that it's holdings are ""Diversified,"" which is usually a good thing, and it has payed the same dividend for a few years in a row, and I think it's ripe for long-term growth. On the other hand, it has been shown that it can drop lower in price. 

  For TWO, I like this stock because it has 13% dividends, a yearly high of 11.00 and a yearly low of 6.91, where it currently sits at 7.88. This price range is somewhat stable for its dividend payouts, and it's also at its lowest price in the trust's history, leading me to think this is a good time to buy. On  the other hand, it isn't diversified like STWD.

Beside choosing the two stocks, I also don't know which ones require the dreaded ""K-1"" tax form, or what the ""catch"" is. I know I need to pay the taxes on dividends equivalent to my income tax bracket, but that's all I know. Any relevant details like such would be much appreciated!",2

It would basically consist of each month buying a few shares in a dividend aristocrat (a company that's been consistently increasing their dividend for 25+ years). Then each month picking a different one in a different sector, eventually having stocks in some 40ish companies, collecting the dividends and reinvesting them whilst continuing to contribute let's say 1000$ each month as well.
I'm only 23 so aiming for early retirement around mid-50's, can anybody see any flaws in my idea ? Thanks a lot",7

While it is unknown if the biscuit and sausage were simply warmed up, the point had to made that compared to a McDonald's breakfast biscuit, the quality in the wendys was much more. Also, the potato wedges that come with breakfast at Wendy's are very delicious. I prefer McDonalds hash browns but the Wendy's potato wedges were not a weak point in the meal.

Example: Let's say next week UVXY hits like 29, I'd want to get like 31 strike May or June calls or something like that. Would I end up getting fucked by that? Or is that a good safe play so that I can yolo with my other moneys and profits from this?",3

This is all multiple times per day. I am always planning my next move. 

I constantly get the urge to invest more and more, even though I know I shouldnt. I want to watch the portfolio grow, but I cant wait. I even get anxiety when I have to wait a business day for money to transfer in from my bank account.

16-03-09,49pi38,Professional Stock Trader: Ask Me Anything (AMA) About Trading Penny Stocks,"I have been trading for a living since 2002 and have been consistently profitable since 2004. I trade stocks of any price but generally focus on ones in the $1 to $100 price range. I prefer small cap stocks in the $2-20 range but will trade anything that is liquid and has the volume that is needed to really move. I generally don't trade stocks under .50 unless they have a specific catalyst. The reason for this is the SEC started cracking down on pump and dumps in October 2014 and began halting OTCBB and Pink Sheet stocks. Pump and dumps were the only penny stocks that were liquid enough to trade. There are 8000 OTCBB and Pink Sheet penny stocks out there but a majority of them are highly manipulated and illiquid. A lot of people are interested in these kind of stocks but I can assure you that you no longer have an edge and are near guaranteed to lose money due to them being illiquid. The absolute worst of these are the sub penny stocks trading below $.01 per share. These stocks are often compared to gambling in a casino and you have very little chance to profit in them.


Most of the world is completely clueless about the stock market and especially what goes on behind the scenes in penny stocks. I am sure that as you read all the question and my comments below you will see many of these people posting and taking offense to what I say about the reality of the penny stock market. I feel it is finally time to show what it really takes to be a successful stock trader. Please understand that I am talking about trading (day trading, swing trading) and not investing. Trading (short to medium term) and investing (long term buy and hold) are completely different. I focus on technical analysis/ and statistics. Low priced stocks have no fundamentals so fundamental analysis is generally irrelevant especially for companies that do not earn a profit, and very few if any penny stocks earn a profit. Even for a high priced stock if you are a day trader the fundamentals are basically irrelevant except on the day earnings are released, but that only occurs 4 times per year and there are 246 other trading days in the year so it makes sense to ignore the fundamentals for the most part in short term trading.


I will be happy to answer people's questions. Please refrain from asking questions about whether you should buy XYZ stock as I am not a registered investment adviser and I am not legally able to provide this sort of advise.

16-03-09,49qovd,"XSP, SPX, SPXPM, SPY: Seeking Opinions on the Options on S&amp;P500 Options","For those who don't know what I'm talking about:

* SPX is the S&amp;P 500 index. This seems to be the biggest by volume and most well traded of the various options, but its massive size and AM settlement bother me slightly. All options contracts ""control"" 100 of the underlying, and SPX currently is 1990. If you purchased a ""virtual share"" (buy a call and sell a put, two contracts of SPX), it'd behave like a $199,000 security, risks and all. Lots of leverage here, and huge trades with few commissions, I can see why wall-street firms use SPX but I can't imagine myself (a personal trader) ever using SPX as a hedge. It just commands too much money, the ""hedge"" would dwarf the rest of my account.

* SPXPM -- PM Settlement is more in-line with the rest of the options market. SPXPM is still European style and cash-settled, but like SPX it commands far too much money for me to consider using for personal hedging purposes.

* SPY -- SPY is the popular SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF, one of the most popular ETFs on the market with a thriving options market. SPY is currently 199.38, and options are American-style and physical ETF settled. I am currently most inclined to use SPY Options because not only do I own SPY shares (which means my sold calls will be covered by physical shares in my account), but also because the contracts are far smaller and more manageable. 

If I sell a SPY put option as an entry point into SPY (say... at $200 strike), I'm only going to have to front $20,000 to make a cash-secured put. This is still a lot of money for me, but I can at least imagine doing it. Similarly, if I decide to sell SPY call options to collect some premiums / income generation, I do have the 100 SPY available in my account to actually cover a call-gone-bad scenario.

It does seem less efficient however. A lot of brokers charge per-contract and per trade, so having more contracts that command less money will naturally cost me more money in commissions in the long run.

* XSP -- PM-settled, European Cash-settled. With 1/10th the size of SPX, the prices and risks associated with XSP are closer to the SPY options. The primary difference seems to be European style and Cash-settled, which should simplify the analysis a bit. (SPY has dividends, and those tend to complicate things IMO. XSP is just the index however).

----------

Now that's what I do know. For the more experienced options traders out there, I'd like to know...

1. I've only recently discovered XSP. What are the main advantages to it? SPY seems to have much more volume and  open interest. What would the primary benefit to XSP be? Aside from cash-settlement of course.

2. With regards to cash-settled options: what situations would I prefer cash-settlement over physical settlement? [I am aware of ""pin-risk""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_risk_%28options%29), and it does seem like that's mitigated strongly with cash-settlement. Are there any other obscure risks to know about?

3. How are cash-settled options ""covered calls"" handled? Logic dictates that only a margin account can cover this in practice, am I right with this assumption? Do you typically need a margin account to sell calls? I mean... selling calls with cash-only settlement seems to be the only position with potentially infinite downside (if SPX grows to 2100 and you sold a call at 2000 strike, you owe $10,000. If it grows to 2200, you owe $20,000, etc. etc.)

4. If anyone has experience with the various S&amp;P 500 options, can you discuss your experiences? Thanks.

5. It would seem that due to the large size of SPX and SPXPM, the only realistic way for me to trade these would be very conservative strategies: Iron Condors, Bull Spreads, Bear Spreads. These strategies that limit gains / losses to relatively small amounts. Does that sound about right? 

In particular, Iron Condors / Bull Spreads / Bear Spreads are very conservative strategies that almost demands more contracts.

If I buy the 1990 call (currently $21) and sell the 2010 call ($11.50) for March 18th on SPX (bull spread), it will cost me $950, and the most I can make is $2000 (SPX hits 2010 or above on March 18th morning), for a profit of $1050. And the most I can lose is $950 (the premium I paid into the trade overall). + the commissions / exercise fee ($5 per trade, $0.50 per contract at Options house, $5 per assignment. So total of $11 to $21 commissions, depending on where the SPX index ends up)

In contrast, doing the same with SPY or XSP will cost me $95 and make me $105 maximum profit... with $11 to $21 in fees / commissions to Optionshouse. Commissions definitely start to eat into your profits in this case since the underlying bet is so conservative.",2

16-03-09,49qtkh,I spy seven days of greed...,"CNN Money’s Fear-and-Greed Index is, simply put, one of the most useful market-timing tools there is.

For example, this most recent rally, using the index as a trigger, bought the market on the open of February 16 (see the green vertical line on the chart below), a swing that has carried SPY, the SPX ETF, from 188 to 199 today, a gain of 5.3%, but more notably it has so far racked up gains for the 3x-leverage ETF of 17.4% in UPRO, 15.9% in the Nasdaq’s TQQQ, and a whopping 29.5% for TNA, the Russell fund.

That buy signal, now 18 trading days old, is still on and counting but …

But the Fear-and-Greed Index has now registered greed for seven days.  Call it lucky or unlucky depending on one’s bullish or bearish point-of-view but seven days of greed is often all she writes on an upside swing (see the chart) before a sudden sell-down.

As they say, it could be different this time but…

But it seldom ever is.

* Oil cannot trade significantly below its average production cost for an extended amount of time
* Oil was trading far, far too low
* Oil was in ""mass panic"" mode
* Any kind of bounce would wipe out DWTI

Of course, this is *precisely* what happened. Oil barely jumped from $27 to $34, a niggardly $7 jump, and DWTI fell from $450 to $150. I won't try to say that I called the bottom on oil as my average short price is $346 and not $450. But let me tell you that my general idea was right.

The swings were horrible. On some days, I made or lost $50,000+. I would never do this again. But when you believe in something, you have to stick with it. There was no way oil was going to remain below $30 for a significant amount of time.

I am not covering right now because:

* DWTI decays by 15-20% per year, i.e. just by maintaining this position open, I am making a 15-20% return per year (less borrowing fee). See my full article [http://www.fscomeau.com/studying-dwti-decay/](http://www.fscomeau.com/studying-dwti-decay/).
* Even if oil was to fall to, let's say, $30, DWTI would barely jump to $225, far below my price.
* I believe oil will keep going up and will hit $40 shortly;
* I believe oil is on a slow recovery path here.

I believe that within 2-3 years, DWTI will fall below $10. Then there will be a 10:1 reverse split and I won't be shorting 800 shares anymore, but 80. When that happens, I will be ""safe"" to withdraw around $100,000 and just enjoy life with it. Until then, I act as if my gains ""didn't happen"" yet.

Thank you to everyone who supported me, encouraged me, sent me positive vibes and so on. Thank you to everyone on this subreddit who has been there for me. Thank you to everyone who believed in me. Thank you for your continued support and understanding. But after a very wild month, that followed a very wild year, I feel it is better for me to retire from trading and daytrading in general. I am getting too old for this and I have had heart problems in the past year. This has opened my eyes on, without going into any clichés, my own mortality. A serious illness has made me realize I could basically die at any time and I don't plan on spending the little time I have left in this world on trading, no matter how much I love it. I believe I should use my time to concentrate on my family, my hobbies and other personal projects. Finally, I can relax, and I am leaving the world of trading with my head high.

One final advice to you, perhaps as a parting gift? Well, if I were to trade now, I'd short VXX. It's still too high and should fall below $18 within 3 months. Not as exciting as this trade, but far less risky IMHO.

My final advice to you younglings who are perhaps just starting is: whatever you do, don't buy Vanguard ETFs. I'd rather lose 100% of my money on oil than buy one of those boring, useless, ""get in the mould"" funds. Do you want to be another pawn in the line? I thought so.

Have a nice life and thank you again,

My Native American tribe now has cash assets of exactly $100,026 today. We need to grow this money and then be able to support our various programs from the interest monies alone without eroding the principal.

My brother will be entrusted with this task of investing the money and generating interest income from the $100,026. He has a BS degree in Business.

On March 8, the company did a 1-for-70 reverse split . I went on to my online trading portfolio where it shows the price quote of $0.0027 and the market value of $27.00.

When I clicked on the stock symbol that goes to the Stock Research page that shows the charts, company information etc., the price per share is now at $0.16 and the stock symbol changed from VPCO to VPCOD. It also says I don't own any shares

When I went the Portfolio Analysis, it show that the value of my stocks in this company are valued at $1,600.00.

Onto the questions,

What will happen with the shares I already own?

Will they convert over to the new stock symbol so I can monitor and sell when the price is good?

Did the reverse split cause the value of my shares go up to $1,600?

The European Central Bank (ECB) delivered a surprise package of measures to kickstart Europe's economy on Thursday, cutting its main interest rates and expanding its massive bond-buying program.

The bank's president, Mario Draghi, said the outlook for economic growth in the euro zone had been revised slightly down — mainly reflecting the weakened outlook for the world economy — but added that he did not anticipate needing to reduce rates further.

Draghi's comments sent the euro bouncing back off its session lows and yields on US Treasurys rising.

The euro zone's 19 countries are now seen posting average growth of 1.4 percent in 2016, rather than the 1.7 percent forecast in December.

HICP inflation in the euro zone is now seen averaging 0.1 percent in 2016.

16-03-09,49qbp5,Has anyone every been contacted by Mizuho Corporate Global by telephone for an investment opportunity?,"Two weeks back I was contacted by a lady from London that sounded asian  claiming she worked for The Wall Street Journal. She asked if I wanted to participate in a worldwide survey, where I was randomly selected as a participant. I agreed to participate in the survey unless the information was used anonymously. During survey she questioned my age, social position, income (roughly) and some more of those standard questions of which I can not remember the fine details.

Fast forward to this week. Yesterday I was contacted by a someone from Japan working for Mizuho Corporate Global a Japanese investment broker. Stating that they use the Wall Street Journal as a recruitment agency for acquiring new customers. Apparently the survey was not so anonymous after all...

Anyway he had an interesting proposition surrounding a major acquisition by a large firm of which I'm not disclosing any details for god knows what kind of confidentiality level it has. Even though all my alarm bells are ringing DEFCON-1, it sounds like a very plausible hypothesis of what might unfold the coming days/weeks. They requested me to do my own research and provided information by email about Mizuho and the analyst report on the firm.

Today I was called again and denoted that I did my research but not wanted to follow up on the opportunity. I do have some spare coins; however I am not in a position (or willing to) to invest a sum of money in some random stock via a company I do not know. But as all sales people do he tried to convince me otherwise for the next 30 minutes. Rounding up the call by pre-reserving some of the stock option of the concerning firm and stating that he would be calling me back tomorrow for my final answer.

Has anyone every experienced a similar situation or has traded before with Mizuho Corporate Global? And alternatively what would be a good advice to follow in order proceed with this in a very cautious way?

""Twitter Inc. is sweetening its employee compensation packages to stem a talent drain, a pressing move that may be followed by other tech companies with sinking stock prices.

Over the past month, the social media company has been offering additional restricted stock to employees companywide, extending from the upper ranks to junior-level employees, people familiar with the matter said.

In an unusual move, Twitter has granted varying amounts of restricted stock depending on when the employees started working, intending to make up for the value they lost since joining the company, these people said.

Since the fall, the company has also been doling out cash bonuses to some employees ranging from $50,000 to $200,000 as an incentive to keep employees around for another six months to a year, according to other people close to the company.""

""Still, it is a risky move, especially considering Twitter’s already unusually high stock-based compensation costs. Of the 172 U.S. tech companies with at least $1 billion in revenue last year, Twitter had the highest stock-based compensation costs as a percentage of its revenue at 30.8%, according to data provided by S&amp;P Capital IQ. That is nearly double Facebook’s 16.6% and four times Google parent Alphabet Inc.’s 7%.""

The main risk is if some bill gets through congress to block it the deal.

1 share of Allergan will convert to 11.3 shares of Pfizer. As of market close today that is a 15.9% spread with fairly low risk of the deal not going through. Chris DeMeuth Jr. has written about it on Seeking Alpha and has a podcast discussing this trade.

When i was a teen i started to do marketing with Facebook pages, in 2010-2011 it was really easy to get massive traffic from these to landing pages, so with AdSense and CPA i was able to generate a cashflow of ~$0.6-0.8m per year.

16-03-10,49rkjl,Investing within your Health Savings Account (HSA),"So first off for people not sure what a health savings account is - it's an account that accompanies a high deductible health plan (for which you pay higher premiums) in where you and your employer contribute money on a monthly basis in order to cover future healthcare related expenses. Here is a link to the Health Equity (my employer HSA provider) website explaining them in further detail: http://healthequity.com/learn/how-an-hsa-works

So now within these accounts you can invest your money into different funds (once you reach a minimum balance) just like in a IRA or 401(k) and all gains are tax free if used for healthcare expenses. I have not invested my money into any funds yet since I am weary about doing this with money that could possibly be needed in the future in case of a medical emergency. 

I was just wondering what peoples fund allocations were within HSA's and if some people didn't invest this money at all? Do you go with a similar allocation that one would find in a IRA or 401(k) i.e. 80% equities / 20% bonds? 

I was thinking if I did invest this money within one of the mutual/index funds it would be a total bond fund (US or Global) in order to reduce volatility and be more conservative. 

Thanks in advance for any information!

So I wanted to create something that would make options easy to understand (and hopefully fun) by using playful examples and cool things such as superheroes. 

Yes I'm a total geek ;)

I'm also hoping I can get some feedback! This is the link to the first lesson I've created:

http://stockoptionsuperheroes.com/lesson1calloption/

1) How do you feel about mixing money, something serious, with superheroes, which is really not serious at all? Would you read something like that, and would you take it seriously?

2) Any cool ideas you'd like to see me incorporate? I.e, story telling? I'm trying to maintain a balance of fun stuff that's also educational and useful.

Mohammad Nahavandian, President Hassan Rouhani's chief of staff, told the Financial Times that the lifting of sanctions was a ""win-win"" situation for Iran and the west and that it wanted ""constructive interaction"" with the outside world. ""We have to think about the future, and co-operation between the Iranian economy and the outside world would be beneficial to us all,"" he said.

Iran's oil ministry cancelled a long-awaited conference to publicise a new contract for international oil companies in London last month after it was attacked by Mr Rouhani's opponents as an attempt by international oil companies to loot Iran's natural resources.

Mr Nahavandian said that the Rouhani administration was working with its critics to resolve the issue. ""The government has decided to go ahead with the expansion of the oil industry and foreign investment is required for this. We have revised the framework of the [oil] contracts,"" he told the FT.

He added: ""It is not finalised yet; it is open for comments. You cannot call it opposition but there are differing opinions and the government would like to incorporate all these views.""

The valuation was confirmed by a source with knowledge of the deal. Hony Capital and its parent company, Legend Holdings, led the round. Neither have been involved in previous WeWork funding rounds. Hony will help with WeWork's China launch, according to this source.

""Not only does WeWork have one of the largest addressable markets I have ever seen, but the quality of its execution and fit for the Chinese culture is unparalleled,"" Hony Capital CEO John Zhao said in a WeWork blog post about the funding.

Expectations for today:

&gt; Economists are predicting a significant move on Thursday that includes €10 billion to €15 billion per month of additional bond purchases and at least a 0.1 percentage-point cut to its deposit rate—charged to banks for storing money with the central bank. That currently stands at minus 0.3%. Many economists also expect a six-month extension of QE, to September 2017, and possibly more three- and four-year loans for banks.

Live webcast can be viewed [**here**](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html), starting at 14.30 CET. 

Current [Euro area yield curve](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/money/yc/html/index.en.html). Currently, AAA-rated government bonds with a maturity up to 7 years and 2 months have *negative yields*. Let us see what it looks like after the webcast. ",17

16-03-11,4a08l3,Virtual Reality seems too hard to invest in right now,"Hey guys. Just wanted to get your thoughts on something...

I've been thinking about the uptick in interest surrounding virtual reality, and how most of the major headset launches are this year. With all the development going on, it seems like investing in a major VR platform is a good movie in the long run. M&amp;M says it'll be $16bn by 2020. Goldman Sachs says industry will be worth $150bn by 2025.But...

All the major VR platforms are tied into major corporations, and I'm not so sure my confidence in virtual reality outweighs the risk of some of the firms.

Take HTC – the HTC Vive headset looks set to be really strong. But HTC shares were trading at 1300TWD in 2011, and now they're trading at just 105TWD. HTC's mobile division sucks, and there's limited hope for future. Same with Sony. PlayStation is strong, but Sony Mobile sucks – so is PlayStation VR enough to warrant a Sony investment?

Then there's Gear VR, which is Samsung (can it maintain success going forward?), and Oculus, which is Facebook-owned. I'm not sure whether probable success of Oculus is worth the risk of limited growth/struggle to monetise of Facebook.

On top of all this, it's early days and even analysts and journalists seem unsure which VR headset will win out with consumers.

Basically, what do you guys think about investing in VR and the challenges it poses?",2

I have a 2nd OptionsHouse account with about $2-$3k in it. I decided I would toss $20k into it and see what I can turn it into in 1 year. I have $20k pending in my US Bank account and that $20k will be ready to trade come Monday morning.

I want to post daily threads where you guys can comment and share what you think I should put the money towards, but this isn't paper, it's my real money, so I will have final say obviously. (For example, I will only scalp SUNE, I will not hold that fucking timebomb overnight)

So if there is interest, I can start this experiment, if not, then oh well.

Obligatory, go fuck yourselves.

* The IEA, which coordinates energy policies of industrialized nations, said it now believed non-OPEC output would fall by 750,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2016 compared to its previous estimate of 600,000 bpd.

* Iran’s return to the market has been less dramatic than the Iranians said it would be; in February we believe that production increased by 220,000 bpd

* The IEA said it nevertheless saw global oil and product stocks rising heavily in the first half of 2016 in the area of 1.5-1.9 million bpd but slowing to just 0.2 million bpd in the second half, versus estimates of a build of 0.3 million bpd in its previous report.

[**Here is more information**](https://www.iea.org/oilmarketreport/omrpublic/)

1Q2016 demand is expected to be 94.66 mb/d and February supply was 96.5 mb/d. A smaller different in demand and supply compared to 4Q2015 when the difference was 2 mb/d.

For 2016 they are a bit worried about demand staying flat in the US and declining in China.

Oil is already trading at $38.90 hitting a new 3 month record high. Yesterday bad news could not keep oil under $38 for long.

It discusses whether market forces change when the majority adopt a passive investment strategy. 

In this sub the common wisdom is that you're better off investing in index funds than trying to choose individual stocks, which I agree with for the most part.

The article makes the point that the underlying logic that makes passive index investment  work might break if everyone is doing it, as more and more money just pours into the stocks with the largest existing market cap independent of their performance or prospects as individual companies. 

It makes the second point that shared ownership of multiple companies in an industry by these huge index funds acts as an incentive for monopolistic behavior. ",9

Oil is somehow having a small rally , yet stockpiles are at historic levels and OPEC hasn't even agreed to FREEZE production.  If they cant agree to a freeze, how will they ever agree to a CUT?

Gold has been rallying for 13 months now. But they say we are still in a bull market.  But besides that, why is gold still going up when the US economy seems to be slowly on the way up

Today futures are up over triple digits in good response to the ECB, when I read the stimulus yesterday it seemed like an absolute last ditch effort to prop up an economy destined for collapse

Add in a possible greece debt crisis which seems to have been forgotten, China has to breakdown at some point (atleast thats the conclusion I have come to), massive refugees are bound to hurt European economies, Oil companies dropping like flies at this rate which is destined to hurt bank profits when they default on massive loans, China slowling demand on construction which should hypothetically hurt US steel/oil markets.

* The population is incredibly large and continuously growing.
* The IQ of the population is the largest in the world.
* Comparatively to the US there's a lot of room for growth

While risky, I think Africa may be good due to a combination of the following:

* By a lot of metrics Africa has grown exponentially over time - this includes education, corruption, sanitation, and healthcare,
* The population is forecast to grow at an exponential rate to be on par with Asia - Cities are forecast to become more urbanized
* Life expectancy has grown and is again forecast to grow.

I'm aware that the book gets a fair amount of hate on here, but I'm comfortable in taking the plunge given my other retirement investments and savings.

I used about 5 different screeners and sites to compile a list of 50 stocks I was interested in. I used a minimum of 50 million for the market cap. I then did my own math on them all because different sources tended to have similar but not the exactly same numbers. I also had to dig through a lot of value trap stocks. I narrowed the field down to 10 stocks using his valuation principles. I spent a little over 10k on my picks:

AAPL
ENTA
TSRA
RPXC
CALM
BKE
VDSI
GILD
RHI
GD

I used robinhood to save on fees. The problem with that is obviously they have no tools, DRIP, etc. So I'm tracking these with another investment account while doing my plays with RH.

I will be following his magic formula plan, and will update everyone yearly on the performance vs the market. I have no issues with losses and will play the long game with this. My retirement investments are halfway to my age 30 goal of 100k, so I have no problem taking a gamble here (I'm 28 and gross over 100k yearly).

In late January, when markets were tanking, she steadfastly argued that the markets were overreacting to China’s malaise, the Fed’s 0.25-point rate increase, and oil’s rapid decline. None of those issues were serious roadblocks for slow and steady growth in the U.S. and the globe, argued Nixon, who used her down-home way of explaining complex economic issues to talk clients out of cutting and running to safety. 

&gt; Quite the opposite. Instead, Nixon urged them to use the rout to buy riskier assets. One Northern Trust client with more than $15 million did just that. Initially rattled when his portfolio fell hard in the first six weeks of 2016, he took advantage of the overreaction by investing 30% of his cash reserves in a number of risk assets, including high-yield investments, which have jumped 7.1% since Feb. 11.....

&gt; [Nixon recommends **adding positions in U.S. stocks, real estate, hedge funds, private equity, and high-yield bonds.** A model portfolio for the long term, she says, should comprise 35% in U.S. investment-grade bonds, 20% in U.S. stocks, 11% in alternatives, 6% in emerging-market stocks, and 5% in U.S. high-yield bonds.](http://www.barrons.com/articles/get-ready-for-two-more-rate-hikes-this-year-1457759937)

&gt; [The Fraser Institute’s economic freedom index for the U.S. has had a similar trajectory. The index—which tracks the degree to which free-market capitalism is allowed to operate—rose every decade from 1970 to 2000, which coincided with the extended period of relatively strong growth. Since 2000, however, the index has fallen, coinciding with the period of relatively weak growth.](http://www.barrons.com/articles/the-real-reason-behind-slowing-u-s-growth-1457760081)

16-03-13,4a771n,"Bernie Sanders' Proposed ""Tax on Wall Street Speculation""","Bernie Sanders has proposed a ""Tax on Wall Street Speculation"" as a method of achieving free college for everyone in America.
http://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/ftt/Pollin--Heintz--Memo_on_FTT_Rates_and_Revenue_Potential_w_references----6-9-12.pdf

This was taken straight off of Bernie Sanders' website: 
https://berniesanders.com/issues/how-bernie-pays-for-his-proposals/

While Bernie believes the tax will cut the volume of US markets in half, in reality the tax will likely  eradicate upwards of 95% of US trading volume. HFT firms, who account for upwards of 60% of all trading volume in the United States would all go bankrupt. Much of the remaining volume would also be unprofitable with an 0.5% tax on each and every trade. There would be a tiny fraction of the liquidity we have today in the market.

Three things become very clear:

1) This isn't a tax on Wall Street speculation. It's a tax on each and every trade: it is a tax on liquidity. Most of all it's a death sentence to HFT firms (who provide liquidity), who make money by buying and selling for tiny, tiny, amounts of money thousands of times a second, not by ""speculation"". However, it's important to remember this will hurt firms of all shapes and sizes: even those that can still scrape a profit with the tax.

2) The revenue generated would be nowhere near $352 billion. As the tax (which is 0.5% for stocks per trade) would make many firms and trades unprofitable, there would be no trades to profit from. The tax plan assumes that everyone would continue trading at least half as much, and it is clear that the reduction in volume would be far, far greater. Firms would either go out of business or move their business to the Toronto Stock Exchange. 

The same tax was employed in Sweden (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_financial_transaction_tax), and resulted in almost all of trading volume moving to the London Stock Exchange.

&gt;In January 1984, Sweden introduced a 0.5% tax on the purchase or sale of an equity security.

&gt;Even though the tax on fixed-income securities was much lower than that on equities, the impact on market trading was much more dramatic. During the first week of the tax, the volume of bond trading fell by 85%, even though the tax rate on five-year bonds was only 0.003%. The volume of futures trading fell by 98% and the options trading market disappeared.[1] 60% of the trading volume of the eleven most actively traded Swedish share classes moved to the UK after the announcement in 1986 that the tax rate would double. 30% of all Swedish equity trading moved offshore. By 1990, more than 50% of all Swedish trading had moved to London. Foreign investors reacted to the tax by moving their trading offshore while domestic investors reacted by reducing the number of their equity trades.

&gt;As a result, revenues from these taxes were disappointing. For example, revenues from the tax on fixed-income securities were initially expected to amount to 1,500 million Swedish kronor per year. They did not amount to more than 80 million Swedish kronor in any year and the average was closer to 50 million.[3] In addition, as taxable trading volumes fell, so did revenues from capital gains taxes, entirely offsetting revenues from the equity transactions tax that had grown to 4,000 million Swedish kronor by 1988.[4]

As high frequency trading is a development of the 21st century, the effects of the same tax today would have even worse implications on trading volume and the economy. Taking into account the expected revenues of the Swedish tax in comparison to the actual revenues, if we apply it to the expected value of the Sanders tax, the Sanders tax is likely to only generate a measly 10 billion instead of 352 billion dollars. And at an enormous cost.

3) The tax would destroy the US market and be an enormous detriment to the US economy. As evidenced, the tax would put much of the financial industry out of business. However, the tax, which, luckily, is unlikely to pass congress, would be extremely beneficial to the Canadian economy as much of the trading volume would move to the Toronto Stock Exchange. 

Thus begs the question. Does Sanders honestly believe his tax will work? Or is it just a reason to claim he can give everyone free college?

Please keep this an intellectual discussion. I am interested to hear any rebuttals. ",64

I've only been dealing with stocks since January, but I've already made (IMO) a couple good trades and haven't had a loss ... yet :)

So, I bought into $FCX at $3.83 (my first trade so only 4 shares because I didn't know what I was doing at all), then I bought another 16 shares at $7.15, and finally another 10 shares at $8.95 - I just had a good feeling about this company and own some physical PMs so I liked mining companies and bought into a few and a couple ETFs.

Anyway, I now have 30 shares of $FCX at a cost basis of $8.16 (including Fidelity's fees). The closing price Friday was $9.55 - I'm up 16.95% (+$41.53).

I was just reading this article on Seeking Alpha and it got me thinking - should I hold or should I take the gains and get out - or should I buy some more shares?

http://seekingalpha.com/article/3957956-move-freeport-mcmoran?app=1&amp;auth_param=1bc52i:1be8jqs:83aaf75e5c92920d83f85d18d3fb8c67&amp;uprof=45&amp;dr=1#alt1

I would appreciate any opinions on this, I know they still have a lot of debt, the price of copper is really low, etc., etc., but like I said - I just had a really good gut feeling about this company and after looking into it I bought.

So should I stay or should I go? :)

Thanks!

16-03-13,4a7g6l,How is expense ratio of an ETF collected?,"I'm new to investing and am considering purchasing some ETFs. They make good sense to me, but one thing I don't understand is how their expense ratio is typically collected. Consider the following example:

Ticker: EXMPL
Expense ratio: x%
Other ETF fees: 0

Note that EXMPL is a very run of the mill ETF and asses its expense ratio in a typical (possibly standardized?) way.

My questions are as follows:

1) If I were to invest in EXMPL and pull out the next day, would I face a x% hit on whatever I invested due to the ER (on top of taxes, brokerage fees, etc)? Or would it be x/365 % or x/252 %, or some other percentage?

2) While my money is in EXMPL, is the expense ratio deducted from my assets or from the price of the ETF? In the former case, is this done on a daily basis, reducing asset value by the percentage from (1)? In the later case, is the ER automatically built into historical pricing data? And if so, for the purpose of historical calculations, may the ER be safely ignored?",21

- Low interest rates long term  
- Negative interest rates short term of the table (but remain an option on the longer term)  
- High quality corporate bond added to purchase programme

Dividends can be subject to withholding tax, or capital gains taxes whenever they are issued but with a buyback, the increase in the share price following it can be utilized by the shareholder whenever they want to sell allowing them more freedom on how they will be taxed for this.

One argument I've heard agaisnt buybacks, is that if a company is overvalued, buying their own stock is a bad value so getting the cash from the dividend is a better deal; but if you're presupposing the company is over valued, wouldn't the dividend have to be comparably small making its payout relatively worthless?",9

Account review/recommendation - 1 hour (30 minutes F2F, followed by 30 minute review/question answer session)

Portfolio review/recommendation - 2 hours

16-03-13,4a8nhm,Question on long-term holding of ETNs (UWTI/DWTI),"So this post isn't what you think.  First let me say that I am debt free and have other savings and investings, and so anything I end up doing is just extra don't care money.  I know about fees and contango.

Alright /r/investing, so here's the question... generally we are told not to hold instruments like DWTI long-term because they are crafted to to return 3x daily, which may equal 0x long term.  Generally we are told to watch out for contango and fees which can gobble up all profits.

But you know, looking at the charts for DWTI this past year, if someone had invested at pretty much any part of 2014, they would have paid $20 or 30 bucks a position.  If someone did a lot of that and held, convinced the price was going to tumble, then a year later they probably sold for something in the $150 - $300 a position range.

By my math that is anywhere from 7x to 15x.

Looking at the prospectus I think DWTI fees are around 1.35% if you hold it for a year.  

Yes market timing and all that, and yes huge pile-on effect undoubtedly, but in this case I feel like it was kind of obvious what was happening.  I got into the game late, but I did call the DWTI top and got out just hours before the new contracts were announced that day.  So it is possible.

So the question is... am I reading everything correctly... if someone had invested $100k in DWTI back when it was 20 or 30 bucks, and they sold early this year, they would have probably made $1.5 million and only paid fees of about $20k.  Is that right?

I've analyzed everything and don't see any issues with emotional trading. I recently (two weeks) started using Ichimoku. I'm seeing a slight improvement, but the market is such a mess right now its hard to tell. There is a lot of chop, which messes up Ichimoku. I haven't been using Ichimoku long enough yet. 

My question is: do retail traders ever really make money long term or am I better off investing my money? Everybody I speak to in the financial world tells me trading is a waste of time. I'm considering dropping trading options and investing in ETF's. Maybe focus more on dollar cost averaging. 

Trading is time consuming, but I enjoy it. Its difficult because I've put in 110% and am not seen any results.

Oh, I've also been through all the TastyTrade stuff and haven't found much success there either.

Any thoughts? Thanks.",2

16-03-14,4ae25z,Frequency of Trading,"I have a Schwab account that was started by my parents way back when (lucky guy, I know). Almost all of it (~80%) is invested in BMY, which has generally performed very well over last few years. 

There is enough invested in BMY that on a good the day the value of my shares may go up $300 or $400 and down by the same amount on a bad day.  The overall trend has been upward recently. 

My question is: does it make sense to sell some shares on a particularly good day and then wait for a dip in prices to buy more? There is a commission of $8.95 per trade, so each transaction has to be profitable by at least $18. Are there reasons other than the obvious transactions fees that make this a bad idea? Tax issues or anything?

**Info**

* I am 23 years old and make $60K a year. 
* I have a 401K through Fidelity.
* I might start a Roth IRA with Vanguard if possible.

**Questions**

* I’d like to keep a high risk profile since I’m young and have a while until retirement. What would be an appropriate amount of bonds among [my options](https://hellomoney.co/portfolio/2752fc-my-companies-401k-fund-options)?
* I don’t want to lose money but guess I’m okay when my losses are on paper. What I don’t get is the concept of reviewing your asset allocation. If a 2008-like crash were to happen again, what should I do (for my portfolio, and my nerves!)?
* I also don’t quite get rebalancing. Is there a general rule of thumb for rebalancing when you get older?
* My time horizon is 30+ years and I believe that this will let me save enough to live comfortably in retirement. But what if something happens, like I get laid off and need this money before I hit 50?

Once I’m set up with my 401K, ideally I can easily stay the course, and stop worrying about my investments/retirement. I just want to be careful I’m not screwing myself and my future. How can I be sure I’m on the right track?",8

The falling apart of the SUNE/VIVINT deal means that SUNE is going to be liable for a huge fee for not following through with the transaction.  This is because tight covenants of a deal were made even tighter when SUNE went to raise more capital to close the deal halfway through.  These ""even tighter"" deal covenants were rock solid, stipulating that SUNE either had to buy the company or pay enormous damage fees.  It is these fees alone that will bankrupt the company once announced, because either SUNE can issue a shitload of equity, or just declare bankruptcy and litigate in Chapter 11, essentially taking the ended settlement as an interest rate-free loan for a few years.

16-03-13,4a98hh,DCA or Lump Move when Restructuring Portfolio,"I know various forms of this question have been asked and answered but I am struggling with a decision and would appreciate some guidance.

I am working to simplify my portfolio a bit. I have a large stake in three investments. Vanguard SP500 Index, Fidelity Contrafund, Fidelity Balanced. My goal is to get out of Contra and Balanced. The reasons for leaving these are: 1) Expense Ratio; 2) I want to streamline the portfolio. I am moving funds from Contra and Balanced into SP500 Index and Vanguard Total Bond Index.
So my question......My original plan has been to move the funds over the span of a year in order to DCA. As both Balanced and Contra are fairly well correlated to the performance of SP500 does it make any sense to DCA or should I just do a lump move out of Contra and Balanced into SP500 and Total Bond ?

GM declined to comment on how much it paid.

Cruise had raised $20 million from various investors. The startup was a product of the Y Combinator accelerator program.

16-03-13,4a9lzs,Lucrative investment idea for this week,"**Summary**
So the other day I was reading up on sick equity strats, but then noticed [something peculiar](https://gyazo.com/8db62096457358f77174d2d4cc0f87cc).


Indeed, Howard Marks was trying to tell me something.  In this industry, you got to know how to jack this shit and play it rough.  Green, get the money, dollar dollar bill y'all.


**Screening Process**
I took it as a sign to engage in a volatile, risk-on highly aggressive growth strategy and prompty ran an according screen.  I looked for companies with good growth potential, valuation, management, cash flow, balance sheet, competitive advantage, technicals, oh and trading at a steep discount to intrinsic value.


**Company Overview**
I came upon Puring Tarmaceuticals, a biopharmatech company that trades like a staples company, but the market is unaware that Puring Tarma is an energy-tech industrilumminications GICS sector-hybrid, which should warrant a higher multiple.


**Financials**
Trading at only .69 backward-looking inflation [adjusted](https://gyazo.com/8adbf771394caf7ad8bed244313332ff) ttm rolling forward TEV/EBITDARAXWSB, and with 13.37% QoY growth in their 3D-printed cloud security drone-delivered cocaine drug segment (Yttrium Osmium Lithium Oxide), it is clear the market values this company less than I value my time writing this retarded post.  And by that I mean this shit is cheap.


The company should see strong top line revenue growth due to spiking sizes in their end markets, particularly yacht owners (I predict this will occur due to higher discretionary income for the demographic due to an elephant bull pattern I have appropriately identified [here](https://gyazo.com/aacd6177fba203102d4ff5fe8570e63d)).


Additionally, the company was recently upgraded by [Wu Tang Financial](https://gyazo.com/bbee960f3e22f99bab453cdf378ce41e) (their research franchise is a powerhouse).


I utilized a [discounted cash flow model](https://gyazo.com/9b8b75dbed5b9d0f26ec7bcc2e7e0146) and [other sophisticated valuation methodologies](https://gyazo.com/48cd4998f0dca5c7a70896ce3690d5e5) which showed this company is dirt cheap.  Also I have provided financial forecasts:


[Revenue](https://gyazo.com/cc3c4d2d2f24cc600b46bd1d41ccba31)

[Costs](https://gyazo.com/6e652d917e97882922bfa169b6f7841e)

16-03-14,4aeyce,Who likes $GIG updates?,"Fuck you, I do.

They finally released their [10K] (http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1432150/000114036116057556/form10k.htm) over a month after they released their ER. No idea why it took them so long, definitely seems shady. Having read over it I haven't found anything unexpected. 

Anyway, this should remove some of the uncertainty surrounding the stock. The only big worry left is that Nokia, having merged with Alcatel-Lucent, still hasn't signed a new deal with $GIG. On the one hand, $GIG doesn't do too many long-term deals and could be servicing orders on a needs basis, but that would still be a problem if $NOK does not feel it needs to secure this supply line. There is of course always the possibility that NOK is intent on discontinuing that business line altogether or even worse, competing. Before the merger Alcatel accounted for ~25% of GIG's sales. 

Basically, it's a complete mystery why a new deal hasn't been signed. Lot's of bad scenarios, as always, are possible, but it's also very possible that because NOK is fucking huge it's restructuring efforts have not filtered down to updating relatively minute $10-20mil contracts with suppliers. 

On the positive side, institutional investors did indeed pile in during Q4, doubling in number and buying [6x more shares than selling] (http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/gig/institutional-holdings).

* Corporate buybacks poised to surpass the all-time high in 2007

* Contrast to fund outflows running at almost fastest rate ever

&gt;Companies executing repurchases through Bank of America Corp. have bought about $9 billion of shares in 2016, the second-busiest start to a year since the bull market began in 2009, the bank said in a research note last week. Other trading clients have been net sellers, with hedge funds leading the pack, dumping $3.5 billion.

I suppose the good news is that there's additional upside potential if outflows reverse. Bad news is that debt fueled buybacks will become less appealing in the event that rates continue to rise. Continued decline of profits could also have a tangible impact on buybacks.

16-03-14,4acppz,Which exchange should I buy Starbucks in to play their expansion into Italy?,"Opinions are divided about Starbucks' attempt to expand into Italy. Personally I think it'll work, for a range of reasons, but I don't want to discuss that here. My question is about exchanges: Starbucks trades on lots of stock exchanges in various countries, but I don't think they are publicly traded in Italy.

I could just buy their Nasdaq stock, but I wonder how long it would take for any profits from their Italian venture to make their way back to the mothership, and as such whether US SBUX stock would feel much effect from what goes on in Europe.

I realise this is controversial and many still believe SBUX is over-valued, and many can't see this working in Italy, but for somebody like me who believes the stock has some steam in it still (bearing in mind Starbucks has done well in previous international expansions after some delay at launch), how could I best play this particular move?

Thanks!

16-03-15,4afw1c,Small (tiny) Trust-Building Partnership,"(I'm copying this intro from another post I made almost a year ago): 

&amp;nbsp;


I'm 18, and I've been reading and learning about investing for around 3 years. For some context as to what I'm talking about, I've read and taken pretty extensive notes on the following books:

&amp;nbsp;


-The Intelligent Investor

-Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits

-Paths To Wealth Through Common Stocks

-The Essays of Warren Buffett

-Security Analysis (almost done)

-One Up Wall Street (not there yet)

-You Can Be a Stock Market Genius

-various research papers and studies

-lots and lots of online reading and researching

&amp;nbsp;


Now that I've established some sort of credibility, I'll cut to the chase: a culmination of both my recent reading, and really almost everything I've learned, has lead me to believe that the simplest, most surefire way to achieve excess returns is through a mechanical strategy utilizing some valuation metric like earnings yield or fcf yield, COMBINED with a momentum component. I'll talk about what lead me to come to this conclusion in an edit if you want. 

&amp;nbsp;


But so basically, I want to be allocating capital for a living when I graduate college (not right after, but within 5 years maybe? Time frames aren't too important right now). Obviously, I can't start then. I've got to work up a client base, I've got to get a lot of people to trust me, and I've got a lot of time to do that so I think it's best to start small. 

&amp;nbsp;


So here's the plan: I ask friends and relatives for any SURPLUS money (over $500? 1000?) they have that they definitely wont need for 3 years (I will also make clear to them that there is a chance they may lose their investment). I'd explain my strategy, show them the data, etc. I'm 100% sure I'd get over $10,000, which, sure, is nothing in the long run. Remember, this is a 3 year trust building exercise! I wouldn't be taking any profits, and all capital would be returned to the clients. But the question is: 

&amp;nbsp;


Is there an easy way to do this legally? Is it possible at all? Is it even my best move? If you are questioning the strategy, I'd be happy to explain in an edit.


&amp;nbsp;


I'd appreciate thoughts, concerns, etc. 


Thanks, Jake

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


**EDIT**: I actually might as well explain the strategy now, it'll help me get my thoughts out anyways. You've probably all heard of Joel Greenblatt and John Bogle (didn't really even need to mention him lol). You may or may not have heard of Tobias Carslile. Those are the three guys I'll be talking about mostly, and they all say pretty similar things. 

&amp;nbsp;


Let's start with Bogle. All I have to say about his influence is that almost all mutual funds under perform. Let's move on. 

&amp;nbsp;


Greenblatt: Guy's a legend. One of the best performances of all time. How? He stayed (relatively) tiny, and totally niche. He grew out of that zone, and is now running the Gotham funds, which are a collection of pretty cool (and a little crazy) mechanical investing funds. He came up with the [Magic Formula](https://www.magicformulainvesting.com/), which said that Earnings Yield and ROIC combined give investors the best of both worlds: value and growth. The Magic Formula is a mechanical investment strategy, and it has [been proven to work](http://www.oldschoolvalue.com/blog/investing-strategy/the-magic-formula-investing/). But it could be better. This is where Carslile comes in.

&amp;nbsp;


Besides writing two books ([Deep Value](http://www.amazon.com/Deep-Value-Investors-Contrarians-Corporations/dp/1118747968), and [Quantitative Value](http://www.amazon.com/Quantitative-Value-Web-Site-Practitioners/dp/1118328078), both of which I've heard are great, although I think I've gotten a pretty good feel for them after listening to all of the interviews and talks by this guy), he hasn't done much in the real market from what I can see. What he HAS done is a lot of research and a lot of analysis. He found that Earnings yield alone does better then Earnings Yield + ROIC from the Magic Formula. And he found that the reason for this was due to reversion to the mean. 

&amp;nbsp;


[Earnings yield](http://greenbackd.com/tag/ebitdatev/) has been proven in [study](http://blog.alphaarchitect.com/2014/10/20/value-investing-backtests-our-analysis-of-13-aaii-value-strategies/#gs.k83POJg) after [study](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r1vJZ80Z7I) to be a metric that produces out-sized returns. So where does momentum come in? Simple. [Even Damordan's research](http://greenbackd.com/2012/04/25/value-investing-works-so-why-do-value-investors-underperform-the-contrarian-value-investors/) has shown that price momentum works well in the short run (periods &lt;1 year). There are a ridiculous amount of [studies](http://blog.alphaarchitect.com/2014/07/16/momentum-investing-ride-winners-and-cut-losers-period/#gs.nm8aXO4) that show simple metrics such as best 6 months return can generate outstanding performance. 

&amp;nbsp;


Well what happens when you combine value and momentum? The results blow up. [One study in particular](https://www.valuesignals.com/Content/Documents/Quantitative_Value_Investing_In_Europe.pdf) (which was the inspiration for this strategy) showed the returns during a 10 year flat market to be in excess of 1000%. 

&amp;nbsp;


SO how would I act on all of this information? Simple. I do (roughly) what Greenblatt and Carslile recommend, supplemented by the study: Sort first by best 6 month performance, then sort by Earnings Yield. Take the top 20, hold for a year, sell, repeat. Simple. Only 2 metrics, and the evidence for them to work is overwhelming. 

&amp;nbsp;


I'm not trying to value companies. I'm not trying to play the market. I have a strategy that I am sure will work, and I am confident that I will be able to stomach any drops and follow it in full for all 3 years. ",1

TRTC is the best 2016 play on the OTC Market for making money off of the 14 more states go up for marijuana legalization in the 2016 election. California and Nevada are also up and are highly likely to pass. TRTC's main operations are in those 2 States.

Reasons why its the best play

1: Its a vertically integrated company that:

* Sells the grow op materials. (Super efficient too and environmentally friendly brooo)
* Grows the weed.
* Brands the weed. IVXX (420? Get it? They're fucking clever as shit)
* Sells the weed through stores. Fancy ass shit like this:
http://imgur.com/heG3VLx (Shit is like Starbucks and Sharper Image for nug bro)
* As well, they use a third-party distributor that also sells some GMO Greenpeace Love vegetables at 1800 vendors. (Entry into the state)

2: The Management Team.

* CEO was a former SVP at Morgan Stanely. Oversaw assets of 100 Mil. Has been using the holding company to pursue an agressive M&amp;A strategy to further the business.

* Other dope ass management with serious business experience.

3: OTCQX.

* Means this company actually reports well and is a decent enough company, unlike PHOT(#negativemarginsforthegainz) this stock actually has the shot of getting up-listed in the future. 

* Mark my words, by 2020, TRTC will have been on the Nasdaq at one point of its existence. Set a remind me please, so I can laugh at you while I'm killing it on my yacht cause of the fat gainz I'm going to get.

Going to be a huge trade in 2016. Enjoy.

I made the same call with CGC.V before the election. 

Do your own due dilligence. You'll figure it out yourself.

We know many american companies setup companies in Ireland to avoid taxes, but if they bring that money back to the US, they are taxed on it. But can they invest in US markets?

My argument was that a company can setup a company in Ireland, tax the low tax and with that money, reinvest it into US markets without having to pay the repatriation of that money.

Is that true? can companies earn money, stash it abroad, then invest it into markets without paying the countries tax? ",8

The Canadian drugmaker, which is under scrutiny for its business and accounting practices, said on Tuesday that total 2016 revenue was expected to be $11 billion to $11.2 billion, down from its previous estimate of $12.5 billion to $12.7 billion.

16-03-15,4agvlg,MTNB...some OTC small cap bio,"Looking for some feedback here. I've been looking through some small cap bio in the last view days and found Matinas BioPharma Holdings. Their clinical stage drugs focus on life threatening bacterial and fungal infections. These two main players are used as a near last resort for patients struggling to defeat these infections. At the forefront...MAT2203 is the furthest along in clinical trials that began on 2/8/16. MAT 2203 is the the anti fungal component of their company which is currently in phase 2a trials. The first article I read was from seeking alphas 6 for '16 small cap bios, and this one caught my eye for a few reasons:
- The stock gained nearly 80% in a one week period which I believe was due to attaining FDA orphan drug designation for there 2nd player MAT2501 for bacterial infections 
- Tomorrow 3/15 they will be announcing an update for the MAT 2203 phase2a trials at the ROTH conference.
After looking around a bit more I could not find any SEC filings into any insider buying or selling aside from recently appointing a new president. Does this update tomorrow mean Anything... I don't know, all I have to go off is this section from there press release on the conference announcement: 

The Phase 2a study is being conducted at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD, under the direction of Principal Investigator Alexandra Freeman, M.D., of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Laboratory of Clinical Infectious Diseases. The open-label, dose-titration study is designed to assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of MAT2203 in hereditary immuno-deficient patients with a recurrent or chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis infection (esophageal, oropharyngeal, vaginal) that is refractory to standard or tolerated non-intravenous therapies. The study will enroll up to 16 patients, and include 14-day dosing and evaluation periods. Depending on clinical response during each treatment period, investigators will have the ability to continue the effective dose for 28 total days or increase the dose of MAT2203 up to two times and extend treatment to a maximum of 54 days.

For the record I'm a daily lurker who doesn't post much but I really thought this might be of interest to certain WSB goers... Take a look into the company if you like... The stock fell from .80 to .67 in a few days after there MAT2501 spike, but I believe there may be some potential here going forward aside from the conference tomorrow.

My stock analysis is not great, I try to look more into the company and the current state of the market as well while trying to improve my financial analysis.

Video games play more of a role in our lives today than they 
have in the years past.  Ten years ago we would sit glued to our TV’s or computer screens for hours on end gaming until we could no longer keep our eyes open.  Today, while it feels different, we still do something similar. Games are now played on our phones during our commute, while in the bathroom, or when just lounging around watching TV.  Our generation has become masters of multiple screens.  These games are cheaper as well, so companies who are creating these games are trying to find new and creative ways to monetize them.

Electronic Arts has a strong collection on both console games along with mobile.  Console franchises which include, Madden, Fifa, Star Wars, Battlefield, and The Sims, and a mobile lineup which includes Plants vs. Zombies and Bejeweled.  While not the strongest mobile offering of the publishers, EA finds a way to connect to a variety of gamers.

**EA Data Points**

**P/E:** 33.01 (Financial Sector Avg: 20.40)

**EPS:** 1.95

**Beta:** 0.68

**Market Cap:** 47.66B

**Net Profit Margin:** -4.21% (Tech Avg: 19.12%)

**52w Low/High:** 53.01 – 76.92

Why does EA have a negative profit margin?  That first data point quickly jumps out at you and requires additional investigation.  When reported in Dec 2015, the company had lower sales than the same time in 2014, and there were investments in certain games (Star Wars for one) that did not yet pan out.  As mentioned above, mobile has been a tough market for EA to get into and the market notices these things.

Two-year trend lines are on a slight decline after almost two years of active growth.  I think again; this has to do with the markets fear in what will EA do next?  I believe we will see a big name mobile acquisition sometime this year.  Depending on how much they spend on this company and how well they are doing will be a big game changer.

Financials aside, EA has been on quite a consumer journey over the past few years.  About three years ago they were one of the most hated companies in the United States with a reputation of unfinished or poorly updated games, as well as killing some fan favorite companies (RIP Maxis) they could not win over gamers.  Even won worst company in America two years in a row (2012/2013).

New management came in and started fixing all the leaks within the EA.  Today we sit here discussing a business that fans now believe and trust as one of the top-tier gaming companies.  The last step for EA is to create a new premium mobile franchise to escalate their portfolio.  Below you can see the profits of gaming companies, and while EA has a slim lead, however, VentureBeat predicts that by 2018 the mobile gaming market will hit $45B and surpass console gaming.

**Conclusion**

EA is one of the largest gaming companies in the world falling slightly behind Activision.  It would be hard to sit here and not recommend buying them, however even with such recognizable franchise names; this has not translated well into mobile yet.  It is strange when you think about games like The Sims which would be a perfect mobile game not yet existing (it probably exists but did not do well enough to stand out).  If EA wants to keep its position near the top, mobile is KEY, and while they’ve purchased big names such as Popcap, it seems we haven’t seen many mobile games from them recently.",10

I'm reiterating my stance on oil going lower in the near future. Things have obviously developed both technically and fundamentally.

http://invst.ly/1b-rf

From a technical standpoint

- Parabolic SAR (the blue cross things) turned bearish, since there was no considerable price movements past $40, which IMO longs really needed that to happen, the bullish momentum died out thus reversing.

- daily uptrend support was broken. and we are currently testing a strong area of support at 36.4

- 5 hour bearish divergence is in play and will confirm if crude breaks 36.15

- with additional downward pressure, Macd is going to turn.

fundamentals

- Nigerian government starting to invest more into preventing attacks on their pipes (which caused a outage)

- Iraqi-Kurdish pipe is back online

- Iran (everyone should have saw this coming in addition to the fact that a ""freeze"" near maximum output means nothing)

- Recent price action in gold makes me believe we see an increase in dollar",4

16-03-15,4ahm14,My company has been approached by a bigger player in our market to buy 50% of the shares. I suspect they are planning an IPO and want our company to have a geographic presence beforehand. How do we position ourselves?,"Started a company 5 years ago with a former colleague (IT related). We did this with the backing of a bigger player who owns 60% of our company. They are now closing business and 100% ownership is transfered to my partner and myself. We are dependant on a bigger partner to make things go around and have been looking for another partner to move forward. 

Suddenly one of the biggest players (let's call them ""EU IT"") in Europe (where we're situated) reached out after they heard our partner closed business. EU IT have a presence in most European countries but have never been able to penetrate our country. They see us as a possibility to do just that. 

Yesterday we found out they are in talks with an investment bank focusing on the tech sector. I have seen this before and it usually means they are looking for external investors to help further growth and then do an IPO in a few years time. 

EU IT wants to do a buy-in with us for 50%. Our company really isn't worth much as it's mostly our customers and employees (and whatever cash we have) that makes up any values; we do not produce any products or develop software. We believe EU IT wants to tick off the box that says ""Presence in country X"" to show they have a good standing in most European countries if/when doing an IPO. This means we can suddenly have a value we never thought of which gives us some worth. 

Last night they sent a draft working as basis for further discussions. They confirmed they were preparing an offer for 50% of our shares but - get this - they write:

*We have the intent to buy a minimum 50% of the shares of [our company] initially, with the desire to have a  first right to buy the remaining shares after X years for a fixed valuation*

First of all we need to clarify what they mean by ""fixed valuation"". No one in their right mind would set a price to sell the company at a fixed price in X years without any further information of what dictates this price. Is it a target turnover, gross profit, market share etc.? We are awaiting a clarification on this. However, this strenghten my suspicions that they plan doing an IPO in a few years time. They probably want to secure the rest of the shares for a good price and then profit when selling down during an IPO.

Now, I understand and respect this way of thinking; it's just business afterall. But the question is: how do we position ourselves so we can max out our values? We're having a conference call with a lawyer later today but thought I'd check to see if someone here has experience in M&amp;A's etc. that could lend an advice or two on how to tackle this.

Thanks in advance!

**EDIT**: OK, so one of our customers went through this exact same thing a couple of years back. I called him up and talked for a good hour. He gave some invaluable advice and put me in touch with the firm they used during this process that specializes in M&amp;A's within the IT sector. We are meeting them already tomorrow. Right off the bat he said that a fixed valuation at time X was not a good idea for us as this would be a call option without a put option - in other words they can exercise their right to BUY but we can't exercise a right to SELL. Equally important was how to set this price. Instead of saying $XX he said we needed to focus on **EBITDA x Enterprise Value** (whatever EV might be for a company like us.) Also, he stressed the importance of defining what is actually included in the EBITDA. Basically he said, define shit and get it in writing in an LOI.",15

Something to keep in mind when you're valuing a company and assuming a high rate of revenue growth for a long while. It also shows why companies that can grow revenues above the norm (Google, Apple, Amazon, Visa, Starbucks etc) are as richly valued as they always are. They are rare birds. 

[Year on Year Revenue Growth by Age of Company](http://i.imgur.com/wZW4tfi.png?1)

What you are seeing is:

X Axis - Years since the first SEC 10-K filing for companies with Revenues greater than $1 Million

Left Y Axis - **Median** % change in revenue year on year (fiscal)

Right Y Axis - Spread of median growth rate (maximum - minimum)

About the database:

- includes all currently active companies (on US exchanges) that have more than $1 Million in revenue in that fiscal
- The dataset starts in 1950 so the oldest companies are 65 years old (at least)
- The data comprises of 6,000+ companies across all non-financial firms

- 12% of companies never make it to Year 2
- By year 12, revenues reach their long term average of 7.5%
- 50% of companies never make it past year 30. This doesn't mean they went bust, just that they are active anymore (could be acquired, merged, gone private etc)",13

Tuesday's disclosure came in a 13G filing, required whenever an investor takes a stake in a company equal to more than 5% of a company. Investors have a 10 day period from the time of purchase to disclose this position.

Based on Tuesday's trading, Cohen's stake increased in value by about $20.7 million from Monday to Tuesday's close. Tuesday's filing doesn't say what Cohen's cost-basis for the stake is.

What I want to track is every ticker that I'm long in so I can see my overall performance, including cost of commissions. I make investments weekly, so what I'm hoping for is the ability to punch in ""purchased 10 shares of VPAIX at 11$ commission of 0$"" or ""purchased 5 shares of CMCSA at 60$ with a commission of 4.95$"", and have it record that lot, and track my overall cost basis.

Bonus points if it can track dividend payouts per broker (one of the brokers doesn't support dividend reinvestment).

16-03-17,4aqk84,"OK, a better $CBAY play","CBAY is about to release phase II clinical data on a drug that activates lipid oxidation.

The importance of the drug:
It's important for many health reasons, namely heart diseases and artery-clogging shit. It makes people more healthy _via_ changing cholesterol from bad to good. BUT IT DOESN'T EFFECT WEIGHT GAIN. Contrary to what you might think, this is a benefit for the drug. Although in some cases, these patients would want to lose weight, not all of them do. Thus the drug can be used by itself without weight loss. _This actually increases the applicable market_.

What you need to know:
The phase 2 is extremely unlikely to fail. Their primary end point has been beaten to death, and to really explain my take on the situation, the company only has to do phase 2 for formality reasons of the FDA. The safety was well tolerated in p1 and other p2 trials (that had a larger/broader patient pool), but now the company needs to focus it for _a specific indication_ .

I don't want to say it _CAN'T_ fail, but how the fuck could it?

They are basically retesting it.. again.

What it means to you:
I don't know the upside, since the stock rose 20% today. But Mr. YOLO Cohen currently owns a cool million shares of the company, bought in December (RIP January). Because of his affiliation with CPXX's explosion, I believe people back tracked him to CBAY, and when word gets around that ""YES. MR COHEN OWNS CBAY"" this may have waaaaay too much momentum, as CPXX did.

May the YOLOs be with you.",11

MannKind was founded by Alfred Mann, a rich Jew doctor who got a ton of pussy and started a bunch of companies that went on to be extremely successful.

For reasons elaborated below, Afrezza wasn’t the breakout success it was made out to be and Sanofi ceased marketing the drug. MannKind tanked, Alfred stepped down and then died in February, shit went sour.


We are in a time of transition. On April 5, Sanofi will hand back over 100% of the rights to Afrezza to MannKind. They have reduced R&amp;D expenses by 65% to focus almost entirely on marketing its sole drug, Afrezza. This is the basis for the company’s future.


I'll cover some common bearish sentiments first.

**1. Pfizer already tried inhalable insulin, and it failed miserably**


It's true, they did. Pfizer used to market a product called [Exubera](http://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/167864/5519.jpeg). Take a look at it. Why do you think that bathmate penis pump bong didn't take off? I fucking wonder why. The two aren't comparable. [Afrezza is the size of your little sisters rape whistle.]( http://www.diabetesnet.com/images/afrezza.jpg)

**2. If Sanofi failed at marketing Afrezza, why would MannKind be any different?**


Good question. Full disclosure, the answer to this is conjecture and circumstantial evidence. Believe what you want. What do I believe? Sanofi sabotaged Afrezza. Why do I believe that? Great question. [They've done it before](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-09/sanofi-sued-over-development-of-multiple-sclerosis-drug).


From Reuters: “The trustee further claims that even after Lemtrada was finally approved in November 2014, Sanofi skimped on marketing it, while actively promoting a different multiple sclerosis drug, Aubagio. As a result, the lawsuit says, Lemtrada has failed to meet any of the sales benchmarks.” 


*Sound familiar?*


Long story short, Sanofi is crooked as fuck. Sanofi has been sued and had to pay judgements in multiple countries because of regulatory violations and criminal wrongdoing. Sanofi has been accused by insiders of destroying documents related to these cases and covering up evidence. And while Sanofi was supposed to be marketing Afrezza, they half assed it while pushing their own two proprietary insulin drugs. No split profits on those babies. Sanofi makes shitty deals with companies that make drugs they think are a threat, and tanks them. That's big pharma for you.


**3. They don’t have the cash**


Maybe. They started the year with 60 million on hand. They have access to a 30 million dollar credit line from the Mann group, yet to be tapped. When asked on earnings call if they expected to, the CEO laughed and said no, but it’s nice to know it’s there. I don’t know, but I think they’ve got what they need.


**AND**


Sanofi may settle. MNKD is arguing that Sanofi did not terminate the agreement in good faith. It may be a few million, it may be a few hundred million. It may be nothing, but I believe MannKind is going to see some cash from Sanofi real soon.


**AND**


Al Mann's will may have some money for MNKD. Afrezza was his baby and his life's work.


Why you should buy:


**1. MannKind just hired a new CCO to assist in marketing who is a complete badass**


VP of Amgen and supervised 9 insulin related drugs for 3 years. Prior to that he was executive director of Bristol-Meyers Squibbs, prior to that VP and division head for biopharmaceuticals at Sandoz (Novartis), prior to that worked at Merck, Serono, Pharmasset, and DuPont. Sounds like a guy who would join a company facing imminent bankruptcy and marketing a failed drug, right?


**2. MannKind’s agreement with Receptor Life Sciences**


Under the agreement, the companies would be responsible for the development of multiple inhaled therapies for the treatment of chronic pain, neurological diseases, and inflammatory disorders. **Receptor Life Sciences will bear all the development costs.** Mannkind will share technology with Receptor, which will manufacture and commercialize the inhaled drugs. MannKind will collect royalties of an undetermined amount on successful drugs.


**3. MannKind only has 5 million in short term debt**


**4. As a small company with only one drug on the market, they are lean and can focus their entire efforts on making Afrezza a success**


**5. If you had diabetes, would you rather inject insulin, or use a product like Afrezza?**


It’s small, it’s discrete, it’s not sticking a needle in your arm. Huge QOL improvement.


**So whats the bottom line?**


MNKD has an FDA approved drug that works. I believe in it, so I am long MNKD.


Looking past Afrezza, MannKind’s inhaler technology and their agreement with RLS could pave the way for some major future moneymakers.

**Why do I give this much of a shit?**

I believe in this drug. I believe it can help people. You need only to search around for patient reviews to see how it can change lives. I am investing in a product that I believe in. If mannkind can get insurance companies and doctors on board with this, this changes diabetes management worldwide.

Long story short; I am almost 25 and work in private equity.  I'm currently liquid for right around $100K, of which 90% I want to invest in an aggressive, diversified portfolio. 


Being in private equity, I have access to investing in merchant cash advances (MCA) and working capital loans.  For those unfamiliar, these are basically payday loans for small businesses that destroy their cash flow but earn 4-12% simple interest monthly (i.e. 35-50% over 4-6 months).
I am wondering if any has any industry data, or experience working with these types of loans.  I know that Prosper, Lending Club, and others offer personal term loans, which are significantly more conservative than the loans that I'm describing. 


Ideally my portfolio would look something like...
40% Working Capital Loans / MCAs
30% Growth Stocks
20% Dividend Stocks / BDC Stocks
10% Cash / Emergency Fund / Spending $$$


I would like some criticism on my portfolio and suggestions, advice, anything at all.

16-03-16,4aofx0,Activision - Company Analysis,"Today is day two of our four-day stock analysis of video game companies.  Yesterday we explored Electronic Arts and today we tackle the largest video game company in the world, Activision.

Activision has made significant moves over the past decade to ensure their top spot including a merger with Blizzard (known for WarCraft, StartCraft, Diablo), annual releases of Call of Duty, purchasing King (Candy Crush) to become a force in mobile and even more.  With an impressive IP lineup including Guitar Hero, Call of Duty, Destiny, Skylanders, and the Blizzard collection, it is a strong hand that Activision can play.

To remain on top, Activision needs to continue to innovate and while we see that with new franchises, you have to wonder if the company can build off of these new IPs and if the company can produce something more than Candy Crush on the mobile side.

**Activision Data Points**

**P/E:** 26.49 (Financial Sector Avg: 20.40)

**EPS:** 1.19

**Beta:** 1.22

**Market Cap:** 23.75B

**Net Profit Margin:** 11.75% (Tech Avg: 19.12%)

**52w Low/High:** 22.28 – 39.93

The income statement looks fine with normal growth however on the balance sheet; in 2015, they are holding  $3B less in cash, which is now in “other assets”.  This may be due to their acquisition of King, and looking into the cash flow expenditure of $3.6B, I’m thinking that may be correct.

Looking at the Activision 2 year stock chart and after recommended reading of stage analysis, it seems like we are approaching stage 4 meaning the decline may be beginning.


**Conclusion**

With one of, if not the strongest lineup of games from any publisher, Activision looks to remain on top with their current offering as taking shots with their new franchises.  The company is also friendlier with PC games which is positive.  With that, I’m still not sold investing in Activision.  While they are taking some new shots this year, I don’t see this being an above average year for games; along with a weak mobile lineup outside of Candy Crush.  I would wait until the stock gets closer to its 52w low before jumping in.",1

16-03-16,4aogjt,"What's the possible reasoning behind the drop in rates for Certificates in recent years?","I was looking into different certificate rates and I noticed that no more than 6 years ago you could find Certificates that would be above 5% APY.  Let is be known that those were 7 year Certificates, but still some of the shorter Certificates offered rates above 3% on 3 year terms. Compared to now, when looking at a different certificates offered at different banks its almost impossible to find any deals that come close to then. As of right now I can find a 7 year certificate that only offers 2.35%. Sometimes specials come up and you can find a great deal, but that's besides the point.

So I was wondering if anybody had a solid explanation on the drastic decrease in Certificate rates in the recent years. Only thing I could possibly think of is possibly due to the crash of 2008, banks were offering better rates so they could get a hold of money they desperately needed to borrow.  That's my guess, maybe someone else has a better answer.

First time stock market investor here. I have been following this forum and doing research for a few months before I mustered the courage to deposit some money and try my strategy. 

I deposited 1,000 with tradeking. 

Went YOLO on LNCO at price point of .40 /share.
Currently the stock is trading at .66 / share.
Over 50% gain. 

Clearly, I should cash out and  perhaps re-buy if I see another dip.


My question though. My biggest struggle so far is trying to find out how news affects a stock. Such as earning reports, volume, good news, bad news, ect. Perhaps it boils down to speculation..I dunno.

Can someone ELI5 why LNCO's price is changing so much on apparently bad news ( bankruptcy)? After waking up this morning and seeing the news, I anticipated a large loss. I am playing the dips on this stock, and seem to be doing okay. Unfortunately, I can't sell and get my 50%+ gains because of the regulation T rule.

Edit: Is it true I can break the Regulation T rule 3 times before punishment?

16-03-16,4aop9h,Any broker that has dynamic linked trailing stop limit orders like ThinkOrSwim?,"asked this in r/options with no success.  just to clarify, i am NOT looking for regular trailing stop MARKET orders.

for example, a trailing stop sell order for 50cents on the ""ask"" price of an option, with the limit order being dynamically set as 10cents under the ""mark"" price (price between the bid and the ask) ? if the trailing price gets activated, a limit order is submitted for 10 cents below the bid/ask spread

that ability has been invaluable as both a way to limit losses and lock in profits without having to stare at tickers all day. i feel like the usual trailing stop market orders - ESPECIALLY for options, leave a lot of money on the table. could easily lose out on hundreds or even thousands of dollars with a market order instead of a dynamically set limit order on options with a large bid/ask spread

i'm just wondering if other (hopefully with cheaper commissions) platforms have the same ability. i haven't found any yet. i downloaded the IB client and did not see this function

someone mentioned tradeking  but i spoke with them and they only offer regular trailing stop (MARKET) orders. after the price trails below whatever the current/new activation price, it would submit a market order

what i want is for when the price triails X amount below the activation price, it submits a LIMIT order, not for a specific amount, but dynamically for whatever criteria i want (IE X amount below the bid/ask spread)

&gt; Divestment movements are evolving from a simple form of protest, to a proactive strategy to de-fund short sighted businesses and reallocate our financial resources.                       

This really got me thinking. Certainly there are some companies I wouldn’t want to support, like those that are gun-friendly. I also like the idea of making a positive impact and leaving the world in a better place if I can. Alternative energy, cleaner transportation, better infrastructure, healthier food; these sorts of industries are interesting to that end for me. 

If I take a long view though, gun companies (and their stocks) will probably go up in value over the long term, so when it comes to pure investing, the choice seems pretty simple: low cost index funds that contain fewer ethical investments, or high cost actively managed funds that perhaps are more ethical? Is there much of a choice there?

Quote 2&gt; 
&gt;If some tenets of “long term” and “value based” investing are extended to include the environmental and social ramifications of corporate activity, the result can be better financial performance, rather than returns that are “nearly as good” or “worth it when you think of the social benefits.”

Quote 3&gt;
&gt;Aligning your ethical and financial gains will become the mainstream behavior.

Quote 4&gt; 
&gt;In the coming decade where long-term outlook and a concern for the collective sustainability is ever more emphasized, more of us will realize that we can profit by allocating our investments in pro-social enterprises.

I’m not really willing to sacrifice gains for something that I can’t measure, like being more “socially responsible.” Still, I like the idea. If I could have the best of both worlds? Awesome! The author claims that it doesn’t necessarily pay off in the short term, but in the long term it does. 

I’d love to hear from /r/investing here! I guess my question is really this: can divesting from stuff that’s not ethically ideal for me, and investing in more socially responsible companies, possibly compete with simply investing to get the best return? Is it realistic at all? Any tips for getting the best of both worlds? Does anyone have experience with this?

Due to the shear volume of options that exist for each stock, it's important for the high frequency trading programs to focus on the short term options before they focus on the long term options. The short term options tend to have higher volatility and higher return, so the programs trade those options throughout the beginning and middle of the day. Since the long term contracts don't tend to move as much, they scoop up undervalued options at the end of the day. For instance, if gold moves up significantly for the day, the long term options won't move very much even after the move. **You can actually watch what happens to the price of a share and then buy the long term contracts, and then sell them at the end of the day when the high frequency trading programs get around to them.**

16-03-17,4atro1,Fuck Hype: MannKind Due Diligence and Analysis (xpost from WSB),"(This post was made yesterday when the stock was at 1.50. My first post was after ER when it was at 1.20. At the time of this post it is at 1.75. I wanted to share it here as well)

Yesterday I made a post about MNKD that wasn't received well, namely because I didn't provide shit for reasons. Fuck you, I respect that, even though if you would have bought when I said buy you'd have made 22% on the day (and another 5% so far today). But that's neither here nor there. I’m going to DD the fuck out of this stock for you faggots, and if you still have shit to talk you’re not allowed anywhere near my yacht. So let’s get started with a brief history:


MannKind was founded by Alfred Mann, a rich Jew doctor who got a ton of pussy and started a bunch of companies that went on to be extremely successful. He dumped a billion into getting this drug to market. Yadda yadda, they invented Afrezza, an inhalable insulin, it got FDA approval in 2014 and they immediately licensed it to Sanofi for 150 mill and a 65% (Sanofi) and 35% (MannKind) split of the profits. For reasons elaborated below, Afrezza wasn’t the breakout success it was made out to be and Sanofi ceased marketing the drug. MannKind tanked, Alfred stepped down and then died in February, shit went sour.


We are in a time of transition. On April 5, Sanofi will hand back over 100% of the rights to Afrezza to MannKind. They have reduced R&amp;D expenses by 65% to focus almost entirely on marketing its sole drug, Afrezza. This is the basis for the company’s future.


I'll cover some common bearish sentiments first.

**1. Pfizer already tried inhalable insulin, and it failed miserably**


It's true, they did. Pfizer used to market a product called [Exubera](http://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/167864/5519.jpeg). Take a look at it. Why do you think that bathmate penis pump bong didn't take off? I fucking wonder why. The two aren't comparable. [Afrezza is the size of your little sisters rape whistle.]( http://www.diabetesnet.com/images/afrezza.jpg)

**2. If Sanofi failed at marketing Afrezza, why would MannKind be any different?**


Good question. Full disclosure, the answer to this is conjecture and circumstantial evidence. Believe what you want. What do I believe? Sanofi sabotaged Afrezza. Why do I believe that? Great question. [They've done it before](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-09/sanofi-sued-over-development-of-multiple-sclerosis-drug).


From Reuters: “The trustee further claims that even after Lemtrada was finally approved in November 2014, Sanofi skimped on marketing it, while actively promoting a different multiple sclerosis drug, Aubagio. As a result, the lawsuit says, Lemtrada has failed to meet any of the sales benchmarks.” 


*Sound familiar?*


Long story short, Sanofi is crooked as fuck. Sanofi has been sued and had to pay judgements in multiple countries because of regulatory violations and criminal wrongdoing. Sanofi has been accused by insiders of destroying documents related to these cases and covering up evidence. And while Sanofi was supposed to be marketing Afrezza, they half assed it while pushing their own two proprietary insulin drugs. No split profits on those babies. Sanofi makes shitty deals with companies that make drugs they think are a threat, and tanks them. That's big pharma for you.


**3. They don’t have the cash**


Maybe. They started the year with 60 million on hand. They have access to a 30 million dollar credit line from the Mann group, yet to be tapped. When asked on earnings call if they expected to, the CEO laughed and said no, but it’s nice to know it’s there. I don’t know, but I think they’ve got what they need.


**AND**


Sanofi may settle. MNKD is arguing that Sanofi did not terminate the agreement in good faith. It may be a few million, it may be a few hundred million. It may be nothing, but I believe MannKind is going to see some cash from Sanofi real soon.


**AND**


Al Mann's will may have some money for MNKD. Afrezza was his baby and his life's work.


Why you should buy:


**1. MannKind just hired a new CCO to assist in marketing who is a complete badass**


VP of Amgen and supervised 9 insulin related drugs for 3 years. Prior to that he was executive director of Bristol-Meyers Squibbs, prior to that VP and division head for biopharmaceuticals at Sandoz (Novartis), prior to that worked at Merck, Serono, Pharmasset, and DuPont. Sounds like a guy who would join a company facing imminent bankruptcy and marketing a failed drug, right?


**2. MannKind’s agreement with Receptor Life Sciences**


Under the agreement, the companies would be responsible for the development of multiple inhaled therapies for the treatment of chronic pain, neurological diseases, and inflammatory disorders. **Receptor Life Sciences will bear all the development costs.** Mannkind will share technology with Receptor, which will manufacture and commercialize the inhaled drugs. MannKind will collect royalties of an undetermined amount on successful drugs.


**3. MannKind only has 5 million in short term debt**


**4. As a small company with only one drug on the market, they are lean and can focus their entire efforts on making Afrezza a success**


**5. If you had diabetes, would you rather inject insulin, or use a product like Afrezza?**


It’s small, it’s discrete, it’s not sticking a needle in your arm. Huge QOL improvement.


**So whats the bottom line?**


MNKD has an FDA approved drug that works. I believe in it, so I am long MNKD.


Looking past Afrezza, MannKind’s inhaler technology and their agreement with RLS could pave the way for some major future moneymakers.

**Why do I give this much of a shit?**

I believe in this drug. I believe it can help people. You need only to search around for patient reviews to see how it can change lives. I am investing in a product that I believe in. If mannkind can get insurance companies and doctors on board with this, this changes diabetes management worldwide.",37

Apparently a shitty pennystock newsletter was sent out saying that a rise in this stock's price will correlate with the return of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior, or some shit, so a bunch of people are all ""PILE ABOARD THE GAIN TRAIN! CHOO CHOO MOTHER MARY!"" But as we all know, the Gain Train can quickly derail and become the Pain Train. So why will it fail?

For starters, this company has no fundamentals and only has like $3,000 worth of Monopoly money in the bank, which means that some of you merry men in tights even have more capital than this. LAFFO.

Also, its name is an anagram of ""BROK(e)"". Nuff said.

So here's the plan, dumbasses, cause you need it spelled out for you:

It's down in after-hours, it's going to be down in pre-market. It's going to start low and quickly ramp the hell up. Buy it while it's low. Then set your stops.

When you feel it's peaked, sell your jazz and short the shit out of this loose bumhole of a stock. If it continues to rise after you've sold short, do NOT be a tallywhacker and close your position in the negatives. This go-nowhere, do-nothing stock isn't worth dick. You're buying and selling pure emotion and speculation, not something you can put on your kids' plates at the dinner table.

16-03-17,4atytz,Rates and forex. USD.GBP,"Need someone to explain some questions to me as I was looking at investing in a GBP vanguard etf on the LSE. 

Yesterday the fed kept rates the same. My understanding is that this tells the market the U.S. Economy is not as strong as previously expected earlier in the year. This would cause USD to drop and it did. 

This morning Bank of England also chose to keep rates the same. This would mean that the UK economy is not stengthening also. This should cause the GBP to drop. However it has risen today. 

These two no changes of rates should cancel each other out however the GBP has risen. 

I am newer to investing and was hoping to pick up a UK GBP etf as a long term play in hopes that the GBP will appreciate and inhance my returns.   I would then sell and switch to a similar USD etf. 

Obviously I should not go through with this plan now as the two announcements have made this a play I do not understand.

I will put 1000 USD into whatever stock you guys think is a good idea. Preferably high risk stocks that will have an upcoming big swing... maybe they are waiting for news, maybe they are releasing results, earnings whatever.

If it works out, we take that money and yolo it on another stock. Rinse and repeat til we buy a yacht, or we lose it.

16-03-17,4av79v,"FASB's proposed changes to the GAAP leasing model and it's impact to the financial markets","http://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Page/BridgePage&amp;cid=1351027207574


First off, I'm not saying this will have an impact, but I think its worth discussing since it is basically going to change the GAAP accounting treatment of operating leases. As you may know, operating leases currently do not have an impact on the balance sheet of the lessee. Under the proposed ASU, operating leases would now be recorded similar to capital leases where the lessee would record a depreciable asset and a liability that is amortized with each payment. 

I know GAAP measurements are not very useful indicators for valuation, however I'm wondering if there is a big shake up for some companies who's business models are very dependent on the benefits of operating leases over capital leases. i.e airlines, airplane leasing companies, construction equipment companies, rail-car manufacturers and railways etc. 

I believe the disruption would occur heaviest in an industry with long leasing terms, high market price for new asset and comparatively low cost in the secondary-used market

That's **an all time high** and an increase of about 3 million shares shorted between $140 and $190.  That means millions of bears got greedy and are already 20-60% underwater in a matter of weeks.
* The evidence shows that there hasn't been any significant covering since that time, and shorts are getting deeper and deeper underwater as share price creeps up on low volume.

What's the evidence?

* Both of my brokers report zero shares available to borrow at this time.  Prior to this, I was seeing hard-to-borrow messages with estimated borrow rates up to 7%.  Other investors I have spoken with report zero shares to borrow and have reported borrow rates as high as 12%
* Put/Call open interest is at the [98th percentile](http://www.schaeffersresearch.com/content/options/2016/03/16/interest-on-tesla-motors-inc-tsla-options-hits-fever-pitch?utm_source=SR&amp;utm_medium=Link&amp;utm_campaign=Recap) which means intransigent bears are just digging themselves deeper
* Put-Call parity has completely broken down.  Jan 17 $230 calls are trading at $31 while the puts at this strike are $45.  If there were any shares available to short, an investor would have an arbitrage opportunity here and would be able to guarantee themselves a risk-free 6% upon expiration.  Breakdown of Put-Call parity is evidence that short interest is still completely pegged.

So what does it all mean?  Short interest is at an all-time high, millions of those shares are already underwater, a reveal event in two weeks that's been anticipated for years and a Q1 delivery announcement just a few days afterward.  I think this is an obvious set up for a hell of a short squeeze that might propel this stock to all time highs.  The dip to the $140's last month may have been the mother of all bear traps.  ",45

Another thing to notice is how the market responds after it's been below the ZERO line for some time. I call it ""one last kiss goodbye"", some people call it a ""bull trap"". It will attempt to find buyers at higher prices... and fail.

[Most of you probably read my DD post on the 16th.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/4ao6y6/fuck_hype_mnkd_due_diligence_and_analysis/)

Since then we’ve climbed from 1.19 to ~~1.86~~ / ~~2.00~~ / 2.18 a share.


I’m probably going to alienate a lot of you with this post, probably most of you. But I want to put all my cards on the table. Full disclosure: this post contains a conspiracy theory. I don’t necessarily believe all of this, I don’t necessarily believe any of this. [I fully realize this is how I sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nTpsv9PNqo). 


It deserves to be posted. You can do what the fuck you want with it.


There will be two parts, these will be labeled for you. They are **FACTS** and **CONJECTURE**


This is going to center around one thing: **Receptor Life Sciences.**


Let’s get started, shall we?


**FACTS.**


On January 22, 2016, MannKind announced a collaboration and license agreement with a company called Receptor Life Sciences “to develop multiple inhaled medications for conditions such as chronic pain, neurological diseases, and inflammatory disorders.”


From Zacks: “As per terms of the agreement, MannKind will work with Receptor to develop inhaled formulations of certain undisclosed compounds and will perform initial formulation studies. On the other hand, Receptor will be responsible for manufacturing and commercialization. The companies will collaborate on the development of the products, with development costs being financed by Receptor”


All of this begs the question: Who the **FUCK** is Receptor Life Sciences?


On Jan 21, 2016, Mat Pfeffer (CEO) tweeted:  “Receptor Life Sciences is a completely independent entity from MannKind Corporation."" #technosphere #MNKD2


According to MannKind’s website: “Receptor Life Sciences, Inc. is a pharmaceutical development company based in Seattle, Washington.  Receptor is quietly laying the foundation for groundbreaking new products in the specialty pharmaceutical market.”


[How about we visit their website, that should give us some idea.](http://www.receptorlife.com)


Nope.


Don’t bother filling out the form, I’ve done it for you. Here’s what you’ll get


*Thank you for your interest in Receptor Life Sciences. We are pleased to be partnering with MannKind to deliver inhaled therapeutics utilizing their innovative platform. Our work is proceeding rapidly and we will look forward to sharing more exciting news with you as our activities become public.
Thank you again, The Receptor Team*


Checking business records, RLS’s director is a lawyer, Gregory Wesner, an attorney with the Seattle law firm Lane Powell. The address is a residential house in northwestern Seattle. **Traci Carman** is listed as the Receptor Life president, secretary, treasurer and director. Remember her name, we’ll cover it later.


Something else we have to go on is an [FAQ published on MannKinds website](http://www.mannkindcorp.com/Collateral/Documents/English-US/TS%20licensing%20FAQ.pdf)
Read through it. It’s important.


Something may have stood out to you when you read that document. Probably this:


*“The licensing agreement is between MannKind and Receptor Life Sciences, Inc., an independent company, not affiliated with MannKind. The company is private and newly formed under this name. We can confirm that the company is funded by an important investor group, supported by prominent business leaders in the Seattle area. Alfred Mann is not an investor or in any way affiliated with Receptor. MannKind did significant diligence in regards to Receptor and its financial backers, and came away quite impressed. But the underlying investors, for good reasons of their own, need not and choose not to disclose their involvement at this time.”*


All we know for certain is that Receptor Life Sciences, for now, is a private shadow corporation backed by big money in Seattle.


Let’s switch gears for a minute, because I want to tell you a different story.


The Mintaka Foundation is a little organization founded in 2005. Their stated mission is to “find simple health solutions for developing countries using advanced technology”. The Mintaka foundation, funny enough, has [worked with MannKind](http://www.mintakafoundation.org/our-projects/maternal-health/)  on their main project, prevention of maternal death in childbirth. From the site: “Many deaths could be prevented by an immediate intravenous injection of the drug oxytocin. However, it is unstable in warm climates and trained staff is not always available to give injections. Along with MannKind, (we) have developed oxytocin in a dry, stabilized for that can be loaded into a very inexpensive disposable inhaler.”


But who’s behind Mintaka? 3 people. Oliver Hartley, Amos Bairoch, and **Robin Offord.**


On a *totally* unrelated note, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation fucking love helping the Third World. Bill scores a grand slam and probably has a full body orgasm when he can help women and children in the Third World. Anyway, the Gates’ have this neat thing they support called “Grand Challenges”. Basically tree hugging, world improving goals that they award grants for. One of these “Grand Challenges” is called [“Saving Lives at Birth”](http://gcgh.grandchallenges.org/challenge/saving-lives-birth-round-6). One of our friends we’ve met earlier in our story actually was awarded the grant for round 5, **Mister Robin fucking Offord.** [Guess what won it for him?](http://gcgh.grandchallenges.org/grant/reduction-maternal-death-through-postpartum-hemorrhage-highly-heat-resistant-form-oxytocin). The date round 6 was opened was January 12, 2016. It was closed on February 29, 2016. Weird timing, right?


Don’t worry. It gets weirder.


There’s this other guy who lives up in Seattle, sort of a famous dude. His name is [Paul Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen). Co-founder of Microsoft along with Bill Gates, current founder and chairman of a company called Vulcan, Inc. Vulcan invests in companies at various stages of their development through four dedicated groups. We’re only interested in one of them: Venture/Seed Capital. From Vulcan’s website: “The Venture Capital team invests into promising, early-stage companies across the technology, **life sciences** and alternative energy sectors”.
 Paul’s pretty interested in the life science part of this. In addition to half a million in a project for Alzheimers, [he gave 20 million to a company called Omeros back in 2010.](http://investor.omeros.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=219263&amp;p=irol-newsArticle_print&amp;ID=1486345). There’s a bunch more to the partnership, but I’m running out of room and I want to get to the point, because we’re almost there baby, but you’ll definitely want to check out that link. 


Quoted, verbatim, from that press release: “Omeros is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to discovering, developing and commercializing products focused on inflammation and disorders of the central nervous system.” That might sound super familiar, and that’s because the direct quote from MannKind’s press release at the beginning of my post, was that they were partnering with “Receptor Life Sciences, Inc. to develop multiple inhaled therapeutic products for conditions that like chronic pain, neurologic diseases, and inflammatory disorders.”


Oh, by the way. Paul does some other bullshit to. He started a museum, Experience Music Project Museum, a Seattle museum focused on music, science fiction and popular culture. The chief financial officer of Experience Music Project, as of 2012, was a certain [**Traci Carman.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gkiuVz-Ryo)


The facts end here. I’ll keep the next part brief.


**CONJECTURE.**


If you were a billionaire philanthropist (Al Mann), and your billionaire philanthropist friends saw what big pharma did to your project, would your billionaire friends start a private company that couldn't be shorted into near oblivion?

 
**Yes.**


Do we know of any billionaires who already worked with Al Mann on inhaled oxytocin?


 **Yes.**


Are one or more of those Seattle-based billionaires currently involved in innovative healthcare initiatives? 


**Yes.**


**Are Paul Allen and/or the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates foundation bankrolling MannKind’s R&amp;D through Receptor Life Sciences?**

16-03-19,4b1hkh,Exposure to commodities?,"Hi I am rather new to investing and am trying to take a passive approach and am looking for long term goals. I was wondering about commodity ETF's (which tend to have a higher expense ratio) are worthwhile for further diversification. Here is my current portfolio

SCHC (US Aggregate Bond ETF) ~8%
SCHD (US Dividend Equity ETF) ~8%
SCHA (US Small Cap ETF) ~8%
SCHX (US Large Cap ETF) ~8%
SCHH (US REIT ETF) ~8%
SCHF (International Equity ETF) ~18%
SCHC (International Small Cap ETF) ~8%
SCHE (International Emerging Markets ETF) ~8%
SCHB (US Broad Market ETF) ~17%
Cash ~8%

I believe my portfolio is diversified enough, except I do not have exposure to global real estate or other real assets such as commodities. Would it make sense to invest in ETF's in commodities, as I don't feel qualified enough to pick a specific commodity to invest in such as gold or oil. Thanks in advance.

I recently got approved in RobinHood and decided to try investing a small bit of money to try to see how things go. It's my first time buying and would appreciate some feedback on my decision. I have until the market opens to cancel my order, so if I did something dumb let me know.

I split my money roughly 4 ways between these stocks

1. NFLX - I believe in the vision of their founder and I think in the next year or so they aren't going anywhere and will probably expand a ton due to their decision to go international

2. AMRN - They won a recent lawsuit against the FDA and their price hasn't gone up drastically, so seems like a good time to buy.

3. AMGN - On the recommendation of someone with a lot of pharma-specific knowledge

4. MA - Seemed like a pretty safe bet, in case the other ones mess up. 

Plan to sell in the next 6-12 months. If I'm able to get decent returns I plan to invest more with time. ",0

16-03-19,4b1j0e,Question on exercising options to close...,"Hi,

now I know you fuckers love questions. This question might depend on the broker so I'll say that I have TradeKing and yeah I could have asked them but hey maybe I ask the question here so some people get learnt.

Say I only have like $1000 in my account but I bought 3 SPY calls. SPY blows up, my options are in the money, it's a great day. Can I actually get more out of exercising the call and instantly sell the stock than to just sell the call? 

That wasn't even my question. My real question is, if I have a cash account, can I even exercise to close as in exercising the option to buy the stock and immediately sell the stock all in one sweep to get the profit without actually having the funds to pay for 300 SPY ETFs? I know OptionsExpress offers this as ""Exercise and close"" and it doesn't require that you have those funds unless you choose to just ""Exercise and Hold'. But TradeKing is on my type of neolithical shit requiring phone calls. Before I would do something that stupid, I thought I ask. Maybe someone here can talk experience.",14

1. Some of the AH tanking was stupid people with stupid stop losses/circuit breakers.

2. This shit happens all the time and recovery is not impossible, [$PIR for example](https://i.imgur.com/77jhyH8.png).

3. Unlikely to go bankrupt, [the debt](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/aro/financials?query=balance-sheet) is hardly anything for this to become an issue. More likely to be bought over.

4. As stated in their press release, the dispute with MGF slowed down supply which inevitably affected sales. They've got Stifel (firm) in to try and sort some of this mess out and this might mean a buyout could be an option.

5. Worried they might be delisted? Reverse split plzthx.

6. They've extended their licensing agreement with Liverpool ([mid-to-high end retailer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_%28store%29))  in Mexico until 2023. 
&gt;Liverpool will open up to an additional 150 locations under this license extension.  Aéropostale currently has 322 international locations, including 227 locations in Mexico through its partnership with Liverpool.

7. Expanding in [India](http://www.fibre2fashion.com/news/fashion-news/a-ropostale-opens-first-store-in-india-175794-newsdetails.htm) and [Indonesia](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=131103&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=2064438) since 2015. 
&gt; India is expected to become the world’s youngest emerging economy by 2020, with around 64 per cent of its population in the working age group. Having understood this, we are glad to add power players like Aéropostale as additions to our already fast growing fashion portfolio.

8. High open interest and okish volume for Jan 2017 calls. Hoping we won't have to wait that long but a bit of reassurance I guess.

9. Those bashing their stuff, when was the last time you actually looked at their [line](https://www.instagram.com/aeropostale/?hl=en)? Have you seen any [jeans stretchier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGeCBAuUZOA) - my main reason for the yolo.

16-03-18,4ayqnk,A Newbies Diary,"This is my story. I am not here asking for advice. I know that what I am doing is probably stupid but I lack the knowledge to make educated buys/sells however my desire to participate in the market is stronger than my fear of losing money. I have decided that I will get my education in the process of making/losing money as I go.

 

I am new to trading stocks so I did not know anything about it. Absolutely nothing. My early lessons were lessons I felt I should have already known about or considered before making my first purchases, yet I did not hesitate and just went bravely into the darkness with my embarrassingly small amount of money.  
  
  
I opened an account at Ameritrade with $1,000 with the idea that if I lose it I wouldnt suffer from it. I decided I would spread it out a bit because I hear people use the word diversify quite liberally. Well, when you have a small amount of money that didnt work out very well. Making 5% on $400 just seemed so pointless. So I decided to craft my own little strategy to see how I could do with rapid turnaround trading. Here is what I did.  
  
  
Step 1: Sell all of my stocks regardless of gains or losses and work with my entire cash fund as my weapon.
  
  
Step 2: Create a watch list of large companies that have been around for a long time and were established. I felt this would insulate me from losing my money to bankruptcy or just closing the doors for financial reasons. I ended up with a list compiled of companies like Intel, Microsoft, General Electric, Amazon, Qualcomm and well, you get the idea.  
  
  
Step 3: Watch the stocks for a couple of weeks and get a feel for where the stocks seemed to hover so that I could recognize the ups and downs to help me determine if it was a target for recovery.  
  
  
Step 4: Wait for a stock to lose more than 5% of it value in 1 day due to bad news or no reason at all. Once one was identified, I would look for news that might explain the loss in value. If it didn't look catastrophic, I would buy it and sit and wait for recovery. My goal was to make 5% on each trade and get out after. I figured if I can make 5% on every trade my money would grow rather quickly if I was trading several times per week.  
  
  
I had some great luck with this but 5% of $1000 wasn't enough, so I moved another $2000 into the account and started trading with a larger cash base.  
  
  
I started doing this 6 weeks ago, and have now turned my 3K into 4k rather easily. Each time I do this, the profits are bigger because my initial buy in is bigger. I have done this with Twitter, Wal Mart, Bank Americorp, Intel and other stocks of similar size and value.  
  
  
To trade stocks this way, I had to apply for margin tradin with Ameritrade so that I could repurchase stocks immediately after selling. Waiting 3 business days for my trade to finalize was killing me. As long as I do not use more money than my previous trade was worth, I pay 0 interest.  
  
  
I do know that I am only getting lucky because my strategy is that of a moron, but I am having a blast. I wanted to trade stocks but had no knowledge of it, and this is my 6 week success story. Stay tuned for my future post of how I lost it all :)

16-03-18,4aw723,"Anatomy of a Bull Market (VIDEO!) - Today In Trading 3-17-2016. You won't want to miss this....","Hello!

I hope you guys are doing well in your trading. In case you remember I was the guy who made that post over a month ago right at the $26.20 oil bottom calling it the bottom. Thanks for all the commentary and discussion in that thread... it was awesome!

I have another one for you guys. Today's writeup comes in video form [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS5JZDeMk0Q). It's 10 minutes long, and it will in detail go over some of the psychology and possible moves in the market moving forward. EDIT: (I am a bear and am not a bull in this market, this is a video to show you that it's NOT a bull market just because of this recent rally) 

So the major question is...is this the beginning of a bull market, or the start of a bear market? Either case surprisingly starts off exactly the same as what we saw over the last 6 months. It's possible that it will not be clear that it's a bull market until later this year (could be as late as August)... and it will not be clear it's a bear market until likely the summer as well.

So if you plan to trade this year hopefully this can help get you out of a jam... or at least give you some insight into timing your trades and not being the last person in on the trade. 

Choppy waters ahead... Thanks everyone!

Let me introduce myself. I'm a professional day trader of eight years experience. I also have an algorithmic trading platform which I programmed myself. Market and fundamentals are my life--but also so are technical's. 

I made [this post here on /r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/45336n/oil_why_i_believe_this_is_the_bottom_and_if_it/) calling out the oil bottom a day ahead of that bottom ;) so I'm now coming back with my second prediction. This market is going to fall. Or maybe not, what do I know. I'm just some guy from the Internet. 

[Video here](http://youtu.be/IS5JZDeMk0Q) I called it ""The Anatomy of a Bull Market"" to show that in my opinion what's setting up now **isn't** a bull market. There are not only key fundamental bearish notes spread along the entire spectrum (bad debt, chapter 11's, credit downgrades, junk bond selloffs), but the technical's are showing that people don't trust this uptrend either as we're finding lower lows in the SPX and less higher highs over the last year.

The video compares a previous bull market setup with today's market setup and highlights the major differences. Let me know what you guys think, agree or disagree? Tell me why! Let's discuss.

Connecticut state and local governments are all about riding $FCEL's dick. A favorable subsidy outlook, growth with a main customer in South Korea and a huge proposed domestic fuel cell plant called Beacon Falls is driving this stock upwards, after a correction for a shitty ER last quarter. Shitty ERs are par for the course with all renewable companies, but profitability is finally a possibility this decade for $FCEL unlike 99% of the sector. Equipment sales + service revenues for Beacon Falls are estimated at $270-$485m. Profitability is pegged at a 90MW output and FCEL is increasing production to 200MW. Backlog is $400m.

The company is expanding its production capabilities, with carbon capture from coal plants in the pipeline (the U.S. still produces a ton of energy from coal, with a 30% share of total U.S. electric generation in April 2015). It also produces fuel cells for use in fuel cell power plants. These FC plants are ideal for high-density, eastern U.S. municipalities, as these plants generate zero pollution and next-to-no noise.

16-03-18,4azb01,Bear case versus Bull case,"Back when we started to rally strongly from 1830 I [**said**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/497xjw/place_your_bets_weeks_upcoming_economic_data/d0pzrdg) I thought we'd go back up to 2050-2085 before coming back to 1700.  Obviously we've reached that level - but now I'm not so sure that we're headed back down.  Here's my reasoning, what do you degenerates think?

&amp;nbsp;

**Bear:** We rallied too quickly.  
**Bull:** It was a bit slower and more stable than the October 2015 rally  

&amp;nbsp;

**Bear:** The rally was initiated by weak rumors, not hitting bottom or good data  
**Bull:** The market was just oversold and wanted to return to a fair value  

&amp;nbsp;

**Bear:** We have strong resistance 50 points off at 2100  
**Bull:** We traded sideways at that level for all of 2015, doesn't mean we're going back down  

&amp;nbsp;

**Bear:** VIX is hitting [**bear market lows**](https://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=0&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=maximized&amp;chdeh=0&amp;chfdeh=0&amp;chdet=1458332160000&amp;chddm=25234&amp;chls=IntervalBasedLine&amp;q=INDEXCBOE:VIX&amp;ntsp=1), time for a retrace  
**Bull:** VIX is going back to bull market norms, and SKEW has [**clearly deviated**](https://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=0&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=maximized&amp;chdeh=0&amp;chfdeh=0&amp;chdet=1458321107916&amp;chddm=97229&amp;chls=IntervalBasedLine&amp;q=INDEXCBOE:SKEW&amp;ntsp=1) from the high volatility pattern we've seen the past few months

&amp;nbsp;

**Bear:** Oil has skyrocketed on weak rumors, it will drag the market back down when it falls  
**Bull:** Oil was oversold, and even if it goes back down the correlation to stock prices is much weaker than a month ago  

&amp;nbsp;

**Bear:** The weakening global economy will cause the US to look stronger in comparison, reducing corporate profits  
**Bull:** Fed is causing the [**dollar to drop**](https://www.google.com/finance?q=CURRENCY%3AUSDeur), which is driving the market upward and increasing profits for overseas sectors

So I bought the APR 16 230 Call (28 DTE currently) and to reduce my cost basis I sold the weekly MAR4 230 Call (6 DTE currently). About a 200 debit. My goal with the trade was to own a call at 230 (just prior to the event), so I was going to let the short call expire worthless and then be left with a long call. But now Tesla is going crazy and I can currently sell the calendar for about 7.87. This position currently has negative delta because of the higher negative delta of the short option. Would you close for a profit, or swing for the fences and hope that Tesla drops next week and the short option can be closed for minimal amount and then hold just the long 230 Call?

16-03-18,4azx3k,The Options Market and effect on predicting Short Squeezes,"So a lot of talk about ""short squeezes"" is happening on this subreddit lately, but I was wondering how the options market can screw up any predictions.

For those who don't know: a short squeeze is when a large number of people short a stock, and then the stock goes up in price anyway. As the stock goes up, the margin accounts of the short traders gets screwed, so they get margin calls and are forced to buy the stock. That causes the stock to rise in price, and then causes even **more** margin calls, and all in all, the stock price skyrockets.

But shorting a stock is only one potential strategy! The Options market seems to be getting more and more popular recently, and a more sophisticated trader may cover the worst-case scenario with a cheap, deep OOM call option.

By [call-put parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Put%E2%80%93call_parity), we can realize that Call - Stock == Put. So it still seems odd that a whole slew of hypothetical short-sellers would purchase a bunch of call options to take on a complicated position... when they can instead just buy put options and take on the same position with fewer trades.

But what if puts cost significantly more than calls? A market maker would sell puts and then buy ""virtual puts"" by shorting a stock and buying calls.

In this case, ""short interest"" would increase (due to the market maker taking advantage of a risk-free arbitrage opportunity), but the underlying short-interest would have been driven by put-options (which is indeed a short-position, but a far less risky one)... not by masses of people shorting the stock.

I would **imagine** (I'm not an expert however), that when the hypothetical short squeeze happens, the market makers will simply take advantage of their call options to some degree... (maybe even the banks will never make a margin call in an extreme case: because an in-the-money call option is as good as an actual stock). IE: The Short Squeeze will never happen, because all of the short-interest is covered by call options from market makers who have taken on a literally risk-free position... despite a huge amount of ""short interest"".

To the more experienced members of /r/investing out there: does this logic make sense? If not, please discuss your opinion. Thank you for your time :-)

If the above logic is correct, then how does one tell if ""short interest"" is driven by short-selling or if it is driven by puts (and then is a side-effect of market-maker arbitrage) ?",1

16-03-19,4b2u5t,Broke (mostly) college student with 2500$ to invest for 1800$.,"EDIT: wrong title I mean't 2500$ for 18 months :)

I'm a relatively broke college student mostly running on subsistence mode. 

I recently made 2500$ in excess cash from a few gigs I did. Now, I initially just thought of leaving this in my current account in anticipation of some large expenditures I foresee 18-20 months down the road.

I realized that it might be better to invest somewhere to 1- possibly accrue some profit and 2- to at least keep ahead of inflation.

The most obvious option is obviously a saving account but in my country that will barely keep ahead of inflation (I'm somewhere in Europe).

16-03-18,4b0ask,College Student Seeking Advice on Treasuries,"Hi everyone, I am currently a college student and I seek to invest in some U.S Treasuries. My reasoning behind this is that although I study finance and investing in school, I do not have the knowledge or funds to begin investing in equities.
With that being said my money sits in a savings account at a local bank with an APY of 0.150% .... which is absolutely nothing. Obviously treasury yields have incredibly low rates as well (I am looking at 2 year notes with roughly 0.87% interest that pays semi-annually), but I am a humble guy and if I am willing to make a little extra money safely even if its a couple bucks than I will.
So if that means in a 2 year span I could make 30 cents on $100 in a savings account (assuming that the interest rate is constant, which it is subject to change) or $3.48 over two years for a $100 treasury note, I will take the treasury.
My question(s) for whoever reads this is am I missing anything here? Will this not be worth it since I will be taxed at the federal level for this so called ""income""? How much would I be taxed? Would it be better to go with a bill, note, or bond and at what length? Are there any better options that I haven't considered?
Once again I am a broke college student that wants to save up some money, and I figure why not make a few extra dollars on my savings. Any information, articles, links, or videos that you could provide me with would be so greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!",7

16-03-18,4b0kx8,How do Private Lenders Raise Capital,"Sorry of this is in the wrong sub.

I was talking to a buddy of mine and we got onto the subject of Private Lending. The conversation revolved around real estate hard money loans. We were breaking down the process and got hung up on how do Private Lenders raise their capital to lend out. I'm sure a good amount of lenders have internal capital they use, but there has to be a market to raise money to then invest in real estate loans.

So my question (and a few hours of googling left me with more questions than answers) is can Private Lenders issue debt to individuals at let's say a 6% rate and then take that money they raised and lend it out at 10%? I know there is a ton of steps in the middle, but is there a way to issue debt like that?

Also, would the lender be issuing the debt that would Fund the business and then the business could use that money to invest in real estate loans. So the investors would have a claim against the business who then has a claim against properties?

16-03-19,4b3fy3,New to penny stocks. Can anyone show me the ropes and how to get started?,"Hey guys! 

So, I've been reading about penny stocks lately, and eventually came across this subreddit. I was actually inspired to get into this after I saw Timothy Sykes on Instagram, but has since learned that he's not as big a trader as he claims to be - that's what I've been picking up here, anyway. 

I'm very new to trading, but I realize that there is a great deal of economical risk in trading penny stocks, and I'm okay with that. I want this to be a hobby and maybe a secondary income. 

I've been reading some of the top posts, but there are still a couple of things I am unsure of:

* ""Where"" do I buy and sell stocks? Are there a website for that, or how does it work?

* Do I have to be a member of a certain community or website?

* How fast does it work? Like, if I see a stock called ABCD at $1.02 and I want to buy it, how long till it's in my ""account""? Do I have an account with my stocks somewhere, or where do I see my portfolio online? 

* Same question goes for selling the stock - i.e. I see a stock I own is at a higher price level than I bought it at, so I want to sell. Are there any regulations on how fast I can sell a stock after I bought it, and how fast will I have the money in my (bank??) account?

* Are there any books or articles I could and should read before starting, and also while I'm doing it? Any helpful websites any of you have had a positive experience with?


If I have left out any important information or questions I should be asking, please let me know! Also, if this is not the correct place for this post, I am very sorry and please let me know.

Thank you in advance!",9

16-03-20,4b69xa,"Visualization of $SUNE's growing insolvency","$SUNE had to [delay the filing of their 2015 financial reports](http://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/SunEdison+(SUNE\)+Will+Delay+10-K+Filing+Beyond+Extension+Date/11424064.html) twice now due to some accounting issues. However, the sentiment on this company's performance is [surprisingly positive](http://stocktwits.com/symbol/SUNE). So while they're being audited, I thought it would be a good time to do a quick review of their financials.

This is a history of [SunEdison's current ratio](http://i.imgur.com/AeLFtvT.png), using Rubicon Technology and Enphase Energy as benchmarks. This ratio is a measurement of a company's ability to pay off its short-term debt obligations using its ""current assets,"" or assets that can easily be converted to cash within a year (i.e., marketable securities, inventory, accounts receivable, or cash itself).

In their fiscal year of 2014, their current ratio dropped below one. Losing the ability to pay off debts is generally regarded as a red flag to institutions that have a stake in the said company.

This is a history of [SunEdision's debt to equity ratio](http://i.imgur.com/G2LoYc2.png), again using Rubicon Technology and Enphase Energy as benchmarks. This ratio is a measurement of how dependent a company is on loans. The higher the number, the more the company depends on loans relative to capital provided by investors. When this number reaches too higher, lenders become increasingly uncomfortable with extending the company's line of credit.

Take note that the chart is scaled logarithmically. It's also worth considering how much financing it will take for $SUNE to continue operating at their present capacity (that is, if they were to do no further cost-cutting or downsizing).

Financing long term projects is a problem that the renewable energy sector faces in general. SolarCity, for instance, [made only 38 cents on every dollar in operating expenses in 2015](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:SCTY&amp;fstype=ii).

This is just a heads up for those who think solar power is the next big thing on the stock market. Do your own due diligence before making the assumption that solar power is going to take off. Don't be a sheep.",28

16-03-20,4b6ena,Advice on FISV,"Hello All!

A few years ago, through an EPP, I bought into my previous company's stock at a 15% discount (I thought that was gravy) with an average cost of $60. The stock soon split, 2:1, after it hit about $80ish dollars and went to $40 (first time I learned what a split was).

After a few ups and downs (lots of downs) the stock is up above $100 and my returns have been 167% over the past 3 years. I'm trying to figure out when it is good to pull out, if ever. I know of people that have cashed out of situations like this and been happy, some that have regretted, and some that have held and lost significant money after the stock tanks (it can only be so good for so long).

Anyways, I'm hoping that it is not at the apex and that FISV will continue to grow.

They pay these foreigners in fiat currency while receiving tangible goods in return.

I have looked into prosper.com...but chickened out (I don't know the risks well). 

Edit #1: great responses, thank you - very helpful information. A few clarifications based on comments/questions: the person is not asking to be paid, the family member helps others (for gain) and would want to help me without fee (says this is something they enjoy doing). I am not comfortable with not paying of course (however unsure what the right % or amount is). The person is not pushy (currently). The focus of the investment is low cost foreclosures in non-affluent neighborhoods (and therefore, low cost rentals). Based on the comments below, this seems like a recipe for more work and/or bad tenants. My income/tax rate is high - which some have pointed to below as being an advantage for rentals vs. traded products in terms of the tax efficiency.

16-03-19,4b4yda,"Remember this post when you start spewing shit like ""Oil is trading irrationally, market manipulation :C""","Although the market is being over-saturated with oil, it's important to remember that oil is a giant cost for almost every industry. It's single-handedly the most important finite natural resource we have. It's what transports everything everywhere, from businesses to workers,  it's what runs the machines in businesses, from agriculture, tobacco, forestry, and plenty of other industries. Corn productions number one most important resource isn't water, it's oil: it's what runs the machines that harvests the corn, cuts the plants, etc, etc, etc. To reap consistent profits for shareholders, a lot of these big companies use ETFs to counteract the variable price of crude oil. They do this, so if oil were to suddenly go straight to 150, the price of purchasing oil would remain about the same. tl;dr Big companies like Kellogg's, Big Tobacco, etc, generally don't buy oil at the same price you see at the pump.


So when oil prices go up for no apparent reason, think about these huge companies who desperately need cheap oil, cutting deals now for the long term with oil companies, planning to purchase oil in massive quantities, causing the current day price to go up.

Also, in the very long term, oil is seen as finite as a natural resource. So rationally, the price of oil will go up if you follow the little phrase I see being tossed around here all the time: ""buy the hype sell the news"".

**tl;dr There's a whole lot of shit going on that you guys probably don't consider that causes the market to fluctuate. It's not just solely some bullshit market manipulation from some guy in Saudi with a twitter account, or solely algo trading robots designed to push DWTI down.**",12

16-03-21,4baalz,Effect of rig count on domestic upstream oil producers.,"Another shitty oil post.

Rig counts are a big ticket item when it comes to determining consumer sentiment on oil and any goodwill that the market has left. According to bloomberg, there was a slight uptick on US rigs (1 more), and canadian rig counts are falling.

We are coming into the migratory bird window, and there will be very little drilling between now and May/June when things get ramped up again.

In a normal year, this would be status quo, but I'm anticipating market panic with falling rig counts this year. Markets may be rational, but most people are fucking stupid. Look for fire sales on your favourite oil stocks (BTE, VET, TOU, CPG) in the next month as rig counts bottom out, followed by swelling growth in June/July.

Data included below:

http://boereport.com/canada-rig-count/

Alternatively, macroeconomic trends could prevail, and the reduced rig count (combined with rumoured production cuts from OPEC members) could send oil (and these companies) skyrocketing.

I appreciate your comments. Yes, even you.

Snippets:

March 16, 2016 ($33.63 intraday) Update

Thesis:

We have owned this at an average cost of around $102.60. We had a smallish position for us of just under 2.50% allocation. With deterioration, we are now at about a 1% position. I would consider owning Valeant at these prices for portfolios that can tolerate the very high risk. There is not enough data, nor management trust to believe the numbers, and the chance of implosion is quite real. Yet, the potential for reward is there, and Valeant should have revenues well in excess of $10B in Fiscal 2016. In any case, any position we had would be &lt;3% (probably well less) of anyone’s portfolio. My gut tells me that we will just stay status quo, but as days and months go on, that could change.

Observations:

The risks to Valeant are numerous and material, yet we will continue to hold Valeant, perhaps to its death star. Of course I see some type of possible positive outcome, or I would just sell the shares.

Valeant held a conference call yesterday discussing current events, expected 2015 numbers, and guidance for 2016. The market destroyed the stock by a 51.5% drop.

William Ackman wrote to investors yesterday, “We continue to believe the value of the underlying business franchises that comprise Valeant are worth multiples of the current market price.” 

Pearson is claimed to have said, “Our business is not operating on all cylinders, but we are committed to getting it back on track.”

Analysts have been discussing that lenders very possibly will not force a default, since cash flow is being presented and guided in a positive light. The clock is ticking, loudly.
The company is being accused of accounting irregularities and federal fraud violations. It is possible, that if so, a death spiral could or would quickly occur. Perhaps value would occur for bond holders, if equity holders were wiped out.

Valeant released an 8-K yesterday. Here are some notes I gathered from the release:

1. “Preliminary unaudited fourth quarter results were impacted by softer-than-expected sales of the gastrointestinal business, as compared to previous guidance issued in December, driven by reductions in the wholesale and retail channel in reaction to Valeant’s announcement of an agreement with Walgreens.”

2. 2016 Total First Quarter Revenue expected to be $2.3 - $2.4B, prior guidance was $2.8 - $3.1B. Total 2016 Revenue is projected to be $11.0 - $11.2B, prior guidance was $12.5 - $12.7B.

3. 2016 non-GAAP eps is expected to be $9.50 - $10.50, prior guidance was $13.25 - $13.75B.

4. “In discussion with the Board, we have assumed lower growth in our U.S. dermatology, gastrointestinal, and woman’s health portfolios, as well as certain geographies like Western Europe, while keeping our expenses largely unchanged. We plan to work hard to improve these metrics by delivering higher revenues and reducing our costs and, if successful, we hope to beat this guidance in the quarters to come. In the meantime, we are comfortable with our current liquidity position and cash flow generation for the rest of the year, and remain well positioned to meet our obligations.” Michael Pearson CEO

5. “On the revolver, we ended the year with $250 million drawn on the revolver and we're now at $1.45 billion. We obviously are generating cash in the first quarter. We did have, however, some large payments in the first quarter that we discussed. $500 million for Sprout that we talked about.” Linda LaGorga, Treasurer



The risks include:

1. A formal investigation by the U.S. federal prosecutors for overly aggressive pricing and potential insurance fraud.

2. Drug price policy reform by the U.S. government. This would be a concern for most of the specialty pharmaceutical industry.

3. Excessive debt levels, which could become difficult or impossible to maintain. Valeant mentioned they will be able to meet debt levels, but of course that can be taken with a grain of salt.

4. Default risk with delays of releasing its annual statements (10-K). Valeant claims they are negotiating with lenders to cure the late filing default provisions. It is my understanding that if this is allowed; it will often come with a cost, which could be 1% of the technical defaulted obligations.

5. The presentation of Non- GAAP numbers are concerning, primarily because management has given us no reason to trust them. The non-GAAP looks to eliminate all the bad stuff such as stock compensation, various asset step ups because of business combinations, acquisition related costs, impairment charges, restructurings, amortizations and foreign exchange. All a bunch of crap, especially from a company who doesn’t seem to know its ass from its head.

6. Potential exodus of employees departing in mass.

7. Lack of liquidity exaggerated by inability to divest non-core businesses.

Valeant has some meaningful institutional ownership: 

Graphic not included, but you know the players, ValueAct, Ackman, Paulson and Lou Simpson, etc.

 Bonds

The credit default swaps are not deteriorating as much as the stock is. Yet, an article in the Wall Street Journal today stated: “The cost to insure Valeant bonds against default using Credit Default Swaps spiked.” This contradicts the chart below. Keep in mind, I am hardly an expert on Credit Default Swaps, and could in theory be using faulty data.

Bonds are showing deterioration, but not death star (yet):

Bonds 2020 – 2025 seem to be trading (bidding) at the 10% to 11.5% range. Pricing ranges from 75bps to 85bps. Bonds at this point do not appear to be showing imminent death.

 Morningstar wrote today

“As long as the company can stabilize performance and address near-term volatility from the discontinued Philidor relationship, we currently envision Valeant can produce sufficient cash to pay its $1.6 billion cash interest payments in 2016 with some leftover to help pay management’s target debt reduction of nearly $1.7 billion. At the end of the year, Valeant’s senior secured leverage ratio of 2.1 came in under the 2.5 debt covenant, and EBITDA interest coverage of 3.3 similarly surpassed the 3 times covenant requirement. However, the company’s delayed 10-K will remain a concern as management attempts to negotiate with lenders on a cross-default risk by missing its financial reporting covenant. As long as Valeant can file its 10-K by the end of April, we anticipate the company is likely to avoid a technical default with lenders.”  Morningstar 3/15/16 ",29

16-03-20,4b956n,Dropping my current mutual fund. Need advice please.,"I'm 32, and have invested in a fund 8-9 years ago. At the time I had not a clue about any of this, only that retirement savings is important. So when it was time to enroll at work I did and continued to invest direct deposit every check. A couple years ago I finally took the time to educated myself on the meanings of all the lingo on my monthly report my broker sent out. Then educate myself little by little on the investment lingo. I've come to the conclusion that my current mutual fund is a stinker, and needed dropped. 

I called my broker after a little bit of research and named a possible fund. My current one had a awful performance and fees up the ass. I told my broker this and that I wanted   a cheaper fund and vwinx looked attractive to me with the low fees and a long track record of performance. He seemed pretty quick to blow that off and counter with aivsx. Its cheaper than my current but lower than the one I mentioned to him. VWINX is considered a conservative fund while AIVSX is aggressive. Being 32, I have plenty of time to be aggressive I understand. But the conservative fund has just as good long term life performance as the aggressive and lower fees. If I were to pick from one of the two, which should I go with?

16-03-20,4b9ijg,Yet Another MNKD Shitpost - Medical Edition,"So MannKind corp is selling their inhaled insulin (Afreeza) beginning April 5th or so, after Sanofi or whoever terminated their agreement after poor sales. Many would argue that Sanofi mismanaged it at best or sabotaged it at worst. I honestly don't care, but as someone with Asthma and with family that works in asthma care, and with friends who are diabetic, I as curious as to a) the efficacy compared to subcutaneous insulin, b) the ease of use compared to subcutaneous insulin, and c) short/long term effects on pulmonary function.

Since you're all retards I'll define some terms here:

subcutaneous - Below the skin. Typical insulin injections are not the same as your average vaccine or other shot, which are applied much deeper; insulin shots are applied directly under the skin and are thus much easier. There's already a number of automated systems for this.

Pulmonary function - lung function, as it relates to breathing and ability to cycle blood to the heart. Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) are the primary way of testing for asthma, and hopefully any drug that involves inhaling powder would have similar testing done at least in the short term.

Some studies for you to not read:

Many of these relate to Exubera, Pfizer's failed inhaled insulin product, which was similar (albeit in a much larger form).

Pfizer's commissioned study about efficacy and ease of use of Exubera: http://www.sugarnancy.com/articles/ART0021.pdf

Relevant to this is one paragraph in their conclusion:

&gt;In conclusion, the results from this 24-week study suggest that inhaled insulin is effective and well tolerated in patients with type 1 diabetes. Combined with a single nighttime injection of longacting insulin, preprandial inhaled insulin provided glycemic control comparable to that with a conventional subcutaneous insulin regimen with improved postprandial control. Thus, the use of inhaled insulin allowed the number of insulin injections to be minimized to just a single daily injection without compromising glycemic control, while adding increased flexibility of meal-related dosing. As a consequence, inhaled insulin was associated with improved patient satisfaction and quality of life—this may have important implications for therapeutic strategies aimed at increasing acceptance of intensive insulin regimens. Inhaled insulin may, therefore, be a valuable noninvasive component of therapy for patients with type 1 diabetes.

Sounds awesome. It apparently leads to a higher quality of life, and with just one nighttime injection, you have the same level of glycemic control as if you had been shooting up all day.

Effect on pulmonary function on people with mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) of Afreeza's brand of inhaled insulin (rather than Exubera): http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20804443

The conclusion of this is that there wasn't a short term effect, but that longer term studies were needed in order to actually draw some kind of conclusion. I couldn't find any.

So, why did it fail? Relevant article from the NIH: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2769732/

I encourage everyone long or short MNKD to give this a read,  as it portrays the lessons from the failures of Exubera from a number of perspectives. I'll summarize the important ones since none of you are going to read this:

Patients: Wanted something that is discreet (as needles aren't), Exubera failed as it's pretty large. Pfizer should have had more targeted advertising (e.g. in elderly patients where dosing issues aren't as much of a problem, or obese type-2 diabetics where subcutaneous injections take longer to work). 

Untalked about here (as it had not been invented yet) was the automatic insulin pump, which attaches to your body and automatically injects insulin, which meets the discretion need at least. I'm not going to touch marketing as that's a tossup (and I don't know if it's more effective than injections for the markets discussed here).

Diabetologists: Had concerns if this product was better than injections or just a ""toy"". Interesting point about the studies (e.g. the one previously linked) brought up as well:

&gt;While all these efforts helped fulfill the requirements of the approval procedure, many diabetologists were not happy with these studies. Without going too much into detail, the point was raised if the RCTs performed were adequate tools to evaluate the medical benefit of Exubera when it came to its usage in daily practice. For RCTs, patients are selected according to strict inclusion and exclusion criteria and such studies are usually performed by highly motivated and trained centers. Thereby, the patients recruited for RCTs quite often do not mirror the patients that are treated in daily practice. Attempts were made to set up adequately designed studies addressing these aspects in the format of so-called “real world studies.” However, it turned out to be difficult to design such studies in a manner that brought reality into the format of a clinical study while still fulfilling the expectations raised correctly by evidence-based medicine toward the data quality and robustness of the outcomes of such studies.

tl;dr: The studies had a selection bias towards people who would not have issues complying with regimens, and therefore isn't the reality, and additionally studies that attempted to alleviate this were difficult to design.

Pharm industry: Cost was a big reason Exubera failed. In addition to R&amp;D, the low bioavailability of inhaled insulin led to the need for roughly 5x more to be inhaled, which led to increased costs. I personally don't know if Afreeza's brand of insulin is better about this (and by how much), but I can't imagine it being as effective as shots, and therefore a similar issue may be lurking (and Sanofi may have seen this coming).

Politicians: Interesting note from the article

&gt;In view of the unbelievable amount of money that is spent for diabetes therapy each and every year worldwide—currently it was reported that the costs for diabetes therapy were already drastically higher in the United States than anticipated until recently—one should not only try to cut down the costs for diagnostic and therapeutic measures in a more reflex wise manner, but to analyze adequately which measures are the best to counteract the incredible economical burden. However, one should not be surprised if measures such as lifestyle interventions instead of a novel insulin formulation have a more positive outcome in such calculations.

tl;dr: politicians care about costs (even moreso now than in 2008 when this was published), and though the cost of diabetic treatment is insanely high, lifestyle changes are much more cost effective and likely to get support vs. novel (and more expensive) drugs.

The article additionally in its conclusion discusses forward looking thoughts about what would become Afreeza, with hope about it's ability to act faster. This was eventually found to be true, and the major advantage over Exubera (it's also smaller, but I'd argue that's not a big deal).

I've written a lot at this point, mostly because I'm bored and waiting for St. Joe's to play tonight, but my perspective is this: Exubera had a lot of issues for a lot of reasons, and I'm not convinced that MannKind has solved all of these problems. Additionally, since Exubera failed, there's been a lot of other developments in insulin application, and more backlash against higher cost treatments. 

We don't know what Sanofi did for Afreeza, whether it failed to market it properly or even sandbagged it, that will come out in the coming months, and we don't know whether or not patients will like inhaled insulin better the second time around, or if Afreeza's marketing campaign will be better. 

The company is worth just south of a billion with a finished product, and I'll let the finance nerds figure out what kind of revenues they'd need in order to be successful. I'm highly skeptical at this point, however, given what I've found researching this.",21

16-03-21,4bf09q,My post from /r/stocks the other night on SUNE,"SUNE (SunEdison) has been a popular ticker discussion on r/stocks as a sort of novelty stock. Some may consider it to be unworthy of legitimate consideration due to its high volatility and arguably dubious management activity. In this post, I offer no counterpoints to those claims, however instead, I would like the members of this sub to help me consider a trade strategy that may limit risk while increasing potential reward. My idea is as follows and I make absolutely no claims about the integrity of the idea:

The idea: Buy shares of SUNE at current market prices (2500 shares, for example at $2.10-$2.15 = $5250-$5375). At the same time, buy 25-30 July $1 puts at ~$0.34 = ~ $850-$1020. Perhaps even buy more so that you are even more hedged.

Pros: If the company files for bankruptcy or some form of restructuring whereby the common shareholders are wiped out, the puts allow you to recover most of your losses or potentially profit. If the company reports decent results in their upcoming 10K, then the stock appreciates and the company is likely to survive, thus more than likely exposing the investor to substantial upside.

Cons: The stock may stay sideways for more than a few months, rendering the put options worthless if they are not sold sometime before expiry for a significant loss. Worse yet, the stock may stay sideways until the puts expire, and then the company may file for bankruptcy, thus resulting in a total loss of principal investment.

Further discussion: I think this is a decent strategy to consider because the company is being audited and has delayed releasing their latest financial results twice as of now. They also have pending litigation due to a failed merger with VSLR and an ongoing legal dispute with HECO that is expected to be resolved in the near term. It is speculated that they will have a liquidity crunch, forcing a bankruptcy. All of these factors, and perhaps a few others (such as past insiders raising red flags about the company's accounting practices) have caused the stock to depreciate by over 90% within the last 52 weeks. It is my contention that if they are to file for bankruptcy protection, it will happen before July 15th as they will have had to release their earnings well before then, and the audit committee should, in my opinion, have concluded their evaluation by then. Conversely, if the company is even in poor, but manageable shape, I believe the price per share will at least double, as the company is purported to have around 21b in assets and while debt may be around 17b (don't quote me on that figure), the book value of the company is still around 4b+. This means that the market cap is trading well below 20% of book value likely as a result of all of the aforementioned concerns (note that these figures may change materially when their 10k is released). Thus, if one is to make a fully hedged investment using put options for downside protection, it is my contention that now may be a good time to do so as the company appears to either be in its death throes or on the verge of some type of recovery.

I would greatly appreciate any thoughts and critiques on this proposed trading idea. Please note that nothing mentioned in this post is meant to be considered trading advice in any way. It is merely a hypothetical trading strategy that I would like to discuss.

16-03-21,4bcdac,"What are the challenges, rights and obligations when investing small-scale in the US as an European/Swiss?","Hello friends

Since years I regard trading as my biggest hobby. I'm rather conservative with my investments and so far I've exclusively traded Stocks and ETFs on my ""home"" market, the Swiss exchange. 
I've had pretty decent results in the past years, but recently I'm getting a bit stressed. Since half a year we are very bearish and it takes me more and more effort to find opportunities to compensate for the decline of my Swiss Market Index ETFs and maintain an upwards trend.
I've looked into our neighbours' markets in Europe, but I have trouble getting into that. I can't really put my finger on it but I don't find anything ""sympathetic"". 
Plus I'm very Eurosceptic. I'm pessimistic towards the future of the EU and generally europe as we know it – hence expecting a smaller crash at some point, (Brexit, Migrants selling their stocks en masse to finance their trip back etc….) I rather wait until after that before investing.
On the other hand I love the US market. So many opportunities, such diversity and moderately independent from the european cesspit.

However it's also so complicated. It's hard to find reliable info at my Bank because after the US went berserk at our banks, they essentially told everything to do with US to f* off. I can trade at the US stock exchanges, but I basically have to sign a contract resigning from all my rights in terms of privacy and secrecy. This makes me rather uncomfortable.

So I wanted to ask, what else do I have to take into account when investing in the US? How does the Tax system work? Is it even worth it? Right now it seems to me like it's too much hassle with all the paperwork involved. Although I don't even really know what paperwork is involved. My friends and even professionals I know in finance here just laugh at the idea describing the US as a hyperbureaucratic North Korea of finance.
So I figured I would come here for some advice.
Anyone of you invests ""normal"" (&lt;$250'000) amounts in the US without living there? How is your experience overall? Is it really such a difference to European markets? 

The investment volume I'm considering  would be somewhere between $50-100k for the start.",1

16-03-21,4bcdzg,"Nintendo stock: smart, dumb or meh?","I just bought Nintendo stock. I always knew this day would come once I started investing two years ago, because it's been my favorite company for as long as I can remember. 

I realize investing with your heart over your head in a bad idea, but I tried to use both in this case. Here's why I'd argue NTDOY is a good move right now:

* It's entering the app market this year. It's [first offering](http://www.gsmarena.com/nintendos_miitomo_tops_ios_charts_hits_1_million_users_milestone_in_just_3_days-blog-17329.php) (more social media than an actual game) climbed to the top of the Japanese app market within a day when it launched last week. They've announced the next release will be an actual game featuring a familiar character; one or two hits could add huge value to the company (Activision-Blizzard essentially paid $6 billion for Candy Crush).

* Children of the 80s who grew up with NES and SNES are starting to have kids of their own. When their kids reached video-game age, won't Mario and Zelda hold more nostalgic appeal than COD or Halo? (plus, Nintendo systems tend to be less expensive than their counterparts and I hear kids are expensive).

* Gaming in general seems to be experiencing healthy growth. Look at ATVI or EA over the last several years.

* Japan is planning new [stimulus measures](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/03/19/business/economy-business/japan-plans-economic-stimulus-measures/#.Vu__QuIrKUk), which could possibly help.

*Things that could go wrong:*

* Their upcoming console - code name NX - could be a Wii U-caliber flop.

* Their mobile apps could cannibalize their handheld platforms to the point where it doesn't really move their balance sheet.

Anyway, I was interested in hearing other opinions.",1

16-03-22,4bf386,Mutual fund capital gains distributions?,"I always wondered how a mutual fund deals with capital gains from buying and selling stocks. 

Suppose a fund buys one share of company FOO for $50. One month later, FOO is worth $60/share. The fund managers sells its FOO share for $60 in order to buy BAR stock. Does the mutual fund have to distribute the $10 capital gain to fund holders by the end of the year? Can it reinvest the $10 gain and pay it out at the end of the year, or does the fund typically set capital gains aside as cash?

If so, why does the gain have to be distributed? Wouldn't the gain be paid by fund holders when they sell fund shares that increase in value?

16-03-22,4bf3z7,The Anatomy of a Bull/Bear Market - B-Resistance in the SPX - Today in Trading 3-21-2016,"Let me know what you guys think about the market... bearish or bullish, and why. Let's discuss!

Last week I made an on the fly single take video called [""The Anatomy of a Bull Market""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS5JZDeMk0Q) to sort of settle the question most had in relation to their trust in the latest bull run lasting. I heard many call it ""a bull market"" without knowing what that actually means. So hopefully this post can help clarify this. Well in the video we called for a ""b"" resistance move for the SPX to move right up to a certain spot... and today that was achieved, to the penny. When there is no news and volume is light, algorithms sweep prices of equities around looking for buyers and sellers, so technicals take over. So what do we do about this market from here? Is it a bear market? Or is it a bull market? You tell me...

Per Investopedia, the definition of a Bull Market I can agree with. It's - ""Bull markets are characterized by optimism, investor confidence and expectations that strong results will continue."" Well right there, the doubt people have in it being a bull market is sort of counter-intuitive to the very definition of a ""Bull"" market which is pinged with words like *confidence* and *expectations* not... fear and doubt.

So trust me when I say that this isn't a bull market...at all. It's maybe a bullish run, but there will be many months of psychology that has to play out for that confidence and higher 52-wk highs in the SPX... if it even were to happen. So to reiterate, this is *not* a bull market whatsoever. And if there was one that was to emerge from this--we won't know until later this year when it takes that long to even get to new highs. 

Now I'm still highly bearish on the market, and technically I believe we are in the start of a bear market...which is characterized by ""widespread pessimism,"" which all this doubt people have in prices now lead me to believe. A bull market you will know it's bullish...that video will show you how you know. And until we know it's bullish, it's bearish.

So let's look at the tickers, shall we? [SPX today](http://imgur.com/5ENt64w) traded right up to that ""B-resistance"" in the video just as we predicted it would days before. And then it stopped. The [VIX](http://imgur.com/J7lrJOv) fell to new seven month lows as volatility continued to decline in this low volume creep up to that pre-determined resistance. Here's another way to see it in the [SPY](http://imgur.com/yrxFVtm) itself.


Now to compare with previous bull markets, here's the chart from the video. [Historic bull markets](http://imgur.com/otEGTFS) take a long time to break out of the bearish resistances, ""c"" first, ""b"" second, then finally ""a"" to reach the previous 52-week high for that one final test. So right now, we are at the ""b"" resistance. The path to A could be months even if it happened. The plateaued low-volume SPX and the lowering VIX tells me that trading has all but dried up and people are just waiting nervously for that first person to sell off in a panic. The mutual waiting however might end up being the lubricant for the SPX to slide up even higher in the next day or two before that inevitable correction happens to retrace this last leg up--1980 then 1925 I'd say before a second attempt to ride up to try to break B for good. As in... it's going to be chop for a while so don't expect a raging bull move or bear move to just emerge overnight. The deciding factor will come somewhere like...

[here--Scribble Chart Junior.](http://i.imgur.com/ItxAqzO.png) showing the psychology of where that decision will actually be made. There will be a downward move in the SPX within the month, that's inevitable and just how trading is. This move up from 1800 will have some selling. Where that selling stops the market will start to battle over the question ""is this the final 1850's-ish dip I should buy at for the long bull ride up?"" or ""Time to be the first to GTFO so I'm not bag holding for 3 years waiting to get back to 1850's-ish""

Here are some fundamental drivers and to me the two main fundamental drivers of this latest bull run. Corporate junk bond buying and [HYG short covering](http://imgur.com/P91dH55) and the seasonal bullishness in [WTI Crude](http://imgur.com/ClhR3l7) which should be rounding off and turning bearish again before June/July (as long as no OPEC production cuts are announced). I'm actually thinking oil might take a quick knee-jerk downward within the next two weeks before attempting to retest these low $40's levels, flattening off, then falling for good again in July. 

Oil's bullishness is all things seasonal, as OPEC is only spinning rhetoric--nobody is cutting or adding to production with words like ""freezes"" and ""ceiling changes,"" things are just staying the same--which for years we've all agreed is bad. The US is looking to revive the shale game and Iran is gunning to produce 1 mmbbl/day more, so the glut isn't going away any time soon. And on the junk crisis, as soon as the first few debt-burdened companies / small caps has their credit deteriorate or a few Chapter 11's are announced in the news...all it takes is that one catalyst to confirm everyone's fears that this in fact was never a bull market, and you were right all along.

Things need to fall before they rise, it's the cardinal rule of trading. Buuuut... they also need to rise before they fall. So a few really green SPX days to puncture that B-resistance before a reversal might just be the case--just like we saw in early 2011.

Cash might not be a bad idea right now until all of this chop plays out. Trade well, trade safe, and as always--stay liquid my friends.",1

If you make under $100,000 a year you can invest up to $2,000 or 5% of your income a year, whichever is larger.

If you make over $100,000 a year you can invest up to 10% of your income per year.

In 2 months an entire new field of investing will open up for the masses. $2,000 in the VC space can yield incredible amounts if the company is bought out (more likely) or successful to IPO (less likely). The downside is limited to losing the relatively small sum your allowed to invest every year.",109

**PKAY**
These sex store guys got a good penetration (heh) on the west coast market. Nice mix of brick and mortar and online presence. IPO price of $1. Throw some money and fund these guys upgrades to their truck stop signs or whatever.

**PRGN** (ADR)
Yeah, yeah transportation related. So blow me. These bastards are down 97% from a year ago. More a long term thing, but they've got three new Kamsarmax vessels on the way (really big ships that transport a shitload of dry bulk and still fit in the Panama Canal). At least you fucks learned something about ships today.

**AMD**
Ok, I'll be honest I could give a shit about VR but this is where entertainment company execs want their consumer to go. So why not make a bet on the company that has the market cornered? Lots of excitement about these guys with the Intel deal, but looks like VR might be the ""new"" 3-D. Who knows, maybe this will stick along longer this time and move away from the dusty corner of your 90's mall memories.

**MNKD**
Yeah, I bought into /u/xBonerDetective so grab your tinfoil hat and sit the fuck down. Not much to add to this conspiracy theory, looks solid for maybe a month long thing.

**ABGB** (ADR)
Big alternate energy pricks with a foot across a few marginally related industries. Also, they're Spanish as in Spain (not Mexico you sonofabitch). Long story, short: more a long term thing. Down 92% from last year and just got the attention of those private equity bitches to keep them running. 

**GOGL** (ADR)
Yeah, you got me there's a dry bulk shipping theme. You win the prize, now shut the fuck up and listen about the Chinese. Iron ore is big there and they are shutting down plants. Good news is they will need imports, actually either way China comes into play for these guys. Down 87% from last year. 

**MBT** (ADR)
Wildcard. Big Russian phone company and I'm sure those Siberian banished citizens need something to do besides shovel snow. If those sanctions get rolled back, Russia might be a big one to watch and not just for what I'm assuming is a shitty phone service. In Soviet Russia, phone calls you.

**VZIO**
Yeah, I get it, the IPO debut has been delayed. Apparently they spy on their customers. My stake in this is that I like to buy their cheap tv's and pass it off as high end. It works. Maybe the stock will do the same thing.

16-03-22,4bg3xm,DD: Alimentation Couche-Tard [TSE: ATD.B] (Toronto Stock Exchange),"Here's my little DD Alimentation Couche-Tard 

So what is Couche-Tard? It's a 24 hour depanneur (corner store for you Americans out there), that started in Laval, Quebec. It sells gas, candy, beer, etc and is open late. 

Now here's the good news: it's so far only really located in Quebec, with a few expansions elsewhere, but in the last 10 years, they've popped up everywhere, increasing their share-price tenfold. 


It's only gone up 20% since last year, one of it's worse years yet, but there's good news down the line. After reading their quarterly statements, they're planning to take over ESSO gas stations throughout Ontario. Essos in Ontario frequently contain Tim Hortons, Canada's iconic national brand of Coffee. So soon, Couche-Tard, and Tim Hortons and Esso will be striking a deal, coming this summer. ESSO, Tim Hortons and Couche-Tard are all on board, however they're waiting on the provinces to give the go-ahead.

Couche-Tard trades at a PE ratio of 22. QSR, the company that owns Burger King and Tim Hortons, trades at a PE ratio of 78. With a deal going through with Couche-Tard and Tim Hortons, Couche-Tard might receive a good boost to share price to liken it to QSR. That being said, I feel QSR is still quite overvalued, however people are still buying it. 


Finally, with marijuana being legalized some point in Canada, and the immense popularity of Corner-Stores in Quebec, Couche-Tard might even rake in more. Finally, depending on how marijuana is legalized, it might be sold at corner stores, alongside cigarettes. Also when people are high, they eat food from the corner store. This might be a minor influence, however I think it's win-win. Regardless, they have a proven track record of knowing how to turn a corner store into a profit. The food their is slightly overpriced, but it caters to a late night audience.

They consistently beat earnings, almost quarter after quarter. After doing a lot of DD on TSX stocks, and out of the bunch, Couche-Tard seems like a real winner. The only real downside is they have a really small dividend, but I see it more as a growth stock. I put 3k into it this morning, my first position in it. 


TL;DR, if you're a Canadian and have long term money to invest, it's probably still a good idea to invest in Couche-Tard.

Cabelas (CAB), their main competition,  beat expectations by [3.28% last quarter] (http://m.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/cab) and had a nice run following that report. 

Unlike boring old CAB, SPWH is a new and exciting company that only had its IPO two years ago! Look at today's chart to see how excited folks are. Up 4%! Also unlike CAB, they have a great history of beating expectations.

I just started trading using Robin Hood and have about $2,000 in stocks. There's a disclosure form to fill out on my company's website, but it seems very limited and outdated - Robin Hood is not on the list of brokers they provide and I wasn't able to fill out most of the fields, as they're attributed to conventional brokerages. I called HR and they didn't have a clear answer beyond telling me to submit that form. Additionally, the department I work for is unrelated to securities and would not provide me with any insider knowledge - I don't see a conflict of interest here and I'm not sure if the disclosure of personal accounts applies more to the investment bank side of the company.

As soon as this trade goes through, set a trailing stop for $2.00.

Set a limit order to sell at $x.xx (amount needed to buy a yacht, or a gain that you're content with)

Continuing to do this strategy will keep me from losing money, as well as give me mad gainz.

16-03-21,4bea86,Compounding .2% Gains,"I was thinking earlier today about an investing strategy of earning .2% for the day and then selling. It would work something like this:

Have an account set up with ~$20,000 in it, and trades for $8/trade. If I use the full value of the account I would accrue $40, pay $16, and profit $24. That would give me an effective return of .12%, which would increase over time as the $16 cost ate less into my margin.

If I do this 200 days a year, my return would be 27.1% before taxes. After taxes, 16.3%. It seems feasible to earn this every day by watching charts and buying at the right time. 

What are the factors that I might be naive about here? It seems this would be a good strategy to consistently beat the market.

16-03-22,4bgzql,Why Contemporary Art Is Proving a Safe Haven For investors,"With the current state of the financial market causing massive unrest, investors are looking at alternative investments that they think might be a safer option than stocks and shares.  As it stands, events and rumours in China have caused the FTSE 100 to lose billions in recent months. Developed stock markets across the world are also losing money whilst 2015 was a poor year for equities.

What this means for investors is that luxury assets such as gold, contemporary art, vintage wines and even diamonds are becoming increasingly viable options due to people looking to invest their money in something more tangible.  This month it was revealed that gold futures have hit their highest price in over a year, jumping a massive $50 dollars an ounce. This is doubly alarming when you consider the gold market has been rather stagnant for a long time and is a definite indicator of market unrest. Fine art has also seen a recent rise in popularity and has been experiencing a mini boom of late.

Below is a graph showing the steady rise of Post-War and Contemporary fine art prices at Christie’s / Sotheby’s auctions over the last few years.

Dealer Kenny Schachter, who writes for artnet.com spoke out recently on the current furore surrounding the art world, highlighting the fascination with celebrity art as one of the key reasons in its rise.

“Art has become an international global lifestyle,” he said. “At Art Basel Miami, there were 10 celebrity one-person shows, none of which were anything to speak of.  Art has grown beyond art itself and everyone wants to be part of it.

I’m 35 years old and haven’t invested a lick towards retirement to this point (I know, I know).  However, I am more than ready to now.  That being said, a very good and close friend of mine keeps telling me to hang onto my money because he keeps hearing and reading about a looming market correction.  I keep asking for how long do I hold out?  What happens if this correction doesn’t occur for a few years?  He keeps telling me “do the math” or “it’s simple math” to find out how I’d lose if I got in now and a correction occurred.

I know and have read all of the pitfalls of trying to time the market.  At 35, I don’t think I can sit on the sidelines anymore.  I’ve told him that the market will more than likely go up and down a few times over the next 30 years but I feel like I need to get in and get in now.  I can’t put this off any longer.

Petróleo Brasileiro SA, as the company at the epicenter of Brazil's massive corruption scandal is commonly known, had a consolidated net loss of 36.9 billion reais ($10.2 billion) in the fourth quarter, according to a securities filing.

The bigger-than-expected shortfall was 48 percent larger than the 26.6 billion-real loss a year earlier, the previous record. It also turned the company's full-year 2015 result, which was positive through September, into a full-year loss.

I'm only 18 so I don't know a lot about investing, but I'm eager to learn.

Dr. David Fujii has written a new article on the prospects for Galena's lead vaccine candidate, Nevax, which is currently midway through phase 3 trials.  The bottom line summary:

&gt;A 70th breast cancer recurrence event in late March 2016 thus predicts (1) no possibility of NeuVax efficacy equaling 30% or less (the minimum Special Protocol Assessment threshold required for approval by the FDA), (2) no possibility of NeuVax efficacy equaling 50% or less, (3) a 21% chance of NeuVax efficacy between 51% and 78%, and (4) a 79% chance of NeuVax efficacy greater than 78%. This indeed is still a strong and highly encouraging signal!

16-03-23,4bnmhm,"% Total Revenue from Wal-Mart, when it is the Largest Single Customer","Playing around with my database, I got curious to see how much of a firm's sales were coming from Wal-Mart. 

Generally, a company will disclose the % of sales to its largest customer (or group of customers) in the risk disclosures portion of the 10-K and in some other spots as well.

Some standouts to me:

- Greendot (issues debit cards) is effectively a play on wal-mart since 54% of its revenues come from Wal-Mart. 
- Berkshire gets +6% from wally world. 90% of this is from McLeans, BRK's wholesale food division with Apparel making up the rest (fruit of the loom)
- The largest players, who you might think are more diversified (Kelloggs, P&amp;G, Kraft, Clorox and more), have WMT as their largest customer which doesn't bode well for their ability to increase profitability via price increases and really kills bargaining power at annual negotiations

There is more insight when one looks at the trend over time, but the biggest one to me was the fact that sales at WMT are 'sticky'. Basically, if your sales are falling, the sales through wal-mart will fall at a slower pace if at all. And, it is very rare to see an increase in overall sales when your wal-mart are declining. Together, this tells me that wal-mart's portion of your sales is a good indicator for gains or losses in market share and for forecasting sales over the next few years for any business.

But I'm a numbers guy. After someone pointed out the Wolfram Alpha financials, my programmer ears perked and I'm planning on making a little automated application to scrape balance sheet data and throw the numbers into some formulas and shit for some low effort fast analysis. The goal would be to find some undervalued stocks, digest entire balance sheets on earnings reports and scrape off the important info to buy high and sell low and lose my money. There are obviously factors that aren't in the reportings that affect a stock, such as future outlook, emotions, rumors and news (but apparently not an assembly line worker recording himself pulling out his jimmy and giving your Rice Krispies a golden shower). I'm sure some of your fancy broker applications do this shit already, but like a proper noob, I use Robinhood, so fuck you.

So to my original question, discuss which of these metrics or others not listed matter in your opinion when figuring out if a stock is under/over valued?

16-03-23,4bnx9b,"Interesting financial debate concerning the lottery that I had with my younger cousin, input from actual investors to determine who is correct would be much appreciated.","###Backstory:

I'm going to attempt to be as brief as possible. My cousin and I recently bought some lottery tickets for fun, and we each bought 5 tickets/wagers for I believe $10. Now this was all well and good, but on the way home we were discussing the prizes and what we would both do if we won, baring in mind I'm 23 and my cousin is 20. 

&amp;nbsp;

He stated that it would be more intelligent and beneficial to take the top prize at a lump sum and normally I would agree. However here is where the problem lies, you see this lottery is a bit different in the sense that they offer to pay you for the ""rest of you life"" at a minimum of 25 years I believe, but they will pay you for as long as you're alive according to the fine print, unless you take the lump sum. I've read numerous articles and basically everyone agrees that the lump sum is usually the way to go, however this lotteries top prize is only around $5,000,000 or so. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now I'm assuming due to the taxes where I live(45.6% total with state and federal combined) would take a large bite out of your lump sum and leave you with only $3,128,000, or about $120,000 a year in interest earned before taxes, unless the interest isn't taxed? You could live off of the $120,000 for sure depending on your budget, he agreed about this, but when I mentioned that if you didn't take the lump sum you would get $7,000 a week, which is about $364,000(52 weeks) before taxes. This would leave you with $222,040 a year AFTER taxes(0.39% lower bracket than lump sum) which I calculated using the combined federal and state for our location. 

&amp;nbsp;

So it would be $222,040 per year (after taxes) vs $120,000 per year (before taxes, IF the interest is taxed)

*****

My question for you all is if given the choice between $7,000 a week for the rest of your life, OR a lump sum of $5,750,000 which would you choose?

&amp;nbsp;

Who won me or my cousin?

&amp;nbsp;

How would he be able to make more money than me?

Sprint gets bought by Softbank (they own 80-85% or something like that) in order to tank it.  At its cheapest, they get completely bought out (which would delist it).  It went from $4.86 when Softbank went to 80% ownership last August to a little over $3.18 today.  The new owners will restructure it and turn it into a cash cow, competing with Verizon and AT&amp;T.  And then they can sell back shares of the company to get it listed again (dropping their ownership back to at most 85%, though I think they will sell  a lot more than that once they get it where they want it).

Now let’s look at the oil situation and how it is playing out similarly: 

Oil is running out (an estimated 50 years before it is tapped out, though with the nonstop production, that estimate may have dropped significantly).  The companies that are pumping it out without restraint know this.  They are not stupid.  But they don’t want competitors to know they have a plan.

They make oil worthless (it went from a high of over $120/barrel to below $20 at its biggest dip, and barely holding steady around the $40 mark as the world waits for the production to freeze), and in the background, while the competitors are falling, they build up other energy supplies (solar, natural gas, etc.).  

When they get to the negotiating table to discuss the oil freeze to stabilize things, they are not going to.  They have a plan in their back pocket they don’t want anyone to know about.  So they come in making everyone think they are going to help get oil stabilized and help get profitability back into play.  But they won’t, they have no plans to.  This revelation will drive prices down even further, making the final fatal blow to many of the oil companies that depended on the freeze to save them.

These companies that refuse to freeze production will at some point begin rolling out their new business structure, which will be extremely cheap to do because of the lowered costs to buy out other energy companies and use their resources.  

Think about it.  No matter how far out there it sounds, isn’t it possible?  The oil companies that control the production and the negotiating power at the meetings are the same companies that will come out with a new energy source and have the upper hand in control and production of it, and none of the other companies will have the funds or resources to get in on the action.  

It’s like drug companies that invent diseases to make the cure and sell it at a high cost due to demand.  The disease is oil running out, and their cure is a new energy product or at least, a large control of the production of an alternative energy source to oil.

For that reason, I am not investing in any oil companies or any companies related to its production, distribution, refining, etc.  I am going in on solar companies, geothermal, and other renewable resources.  More specifically, I will be finding solar companies that make the products we can use in our own homes (panels, conversion kits, storage batteries, etc.).

http://seekingalpha.com/article/3960359-bear-creek-mining-silver-bear-starting-wake?page=2

Copy and pasted for those who are not seeking alpha members(you won't get the graphs and charts):

Bear Creek Mining is a strong silver play that features: high-quality assets, 290 million ounces of reserves, $20 million of cash in the bank, and no debt.

Leverage to an advancing silver price is strong; arbitration award for Santa Ana could be ~$200 million.

Shares are up 125% YTD.

With the recent strong performance from gold and gold mining shares, one might want to ponder and ask, ""How is gold's little brother silver doing?""

As of the time of this writing, the spot price of silver is trading at $15.83/oz, up 15% YTD.

So, pretty good... relatively speaking. Silver is starting to climb out of its hole (thanks partially to a dovish Fed), and these strong gains have also translated their way over to silver stocks as well.

One particular exploration company, Bear Creek Mining (OTCPK:BCEKF), has so far flown under most everyone's radar, but if the recent surge in silver is a sign of more things to come in the future, this slumbering bear will be sleeping no more...

Bear Creek Mining

Bear Creek Mining controls two noteworthy silver assets, Corani and Santa Ana, both located in Peru. With 290 million ounces of proven and probable reserves between the two projects, it's safe to say that this company is well endowed with plenty of silver. And in a rising silver price environment, leverage is key to unlocking upside potential, so the more ounces you control, the better; Bear Creek thus holds immense appeal in this regard.

Let's now examine each of the company's core assets.

Corani

The Corani silver-lead-zinc deposit is 100% owned by Bear Creek, and its flagship project. Corani is one of the world's largest, undeveloped primary silver deposits. It features a life-of-mine (LOM) of 18 years, with annual silver production projected to be 13.4 million oz/year (years 1-5), or 8.4 million oz/year (LOM).

Proven and probable mineral reserves include 228 million ounces of silver, 2.8 billion pounds of lead, and 1.8 billion pounds of zinc.

A Feasibility Study was first performed in 2011, with an updated Final Optimized Feasibility Study completed in July 2015, which shows improved economics (a reduction of CapEx by $54 million to $664 million total capital expenditure), mostly due to the switch to dry-stacking of concentrator tailings, along with other optimizations.

The following slide highlights the Key Economic Parameters:



(1) 5% discount rate, after tax, at base case metal prices ($20/oz silver, $0.95/lb lead and $1.00/lb zinc)

(2) 5% discount rate, after tax, at recent metal prices ($15/oz silver, $0.75/lb lead and $0.75/lb zinc)

Source: Bear Creek Mining

At $15/oz silver, the Net Present Value of Corani is only $52 million, with an IRR of only 6.7%. Quite simply, the project just does not work at these low metal prices.

At $20/oz silver, the NPV jumps to $643 million, with a much more attractive IRR of 20.6%.

According to the company:

""Corani NPV increases approximately $120 million for every $1 increase in silver price (with proportional increases in lead and zinc prices).""

At the time of writing, the spot price of lead was $0.83/lb, and the spot price of zinc was also $0.83/lb. Like silver, the base metals have also been showing signs of a moderate recovery over the last few weeks.

Although, clearly, there needs to be a far more brisk rebound in overall metal prices before Corani can become economically viable. With that said, the company currently has no plans to optimize Corani any further; there will not be another Feasibility Study performed.

From the latest corporate presentation, the project is more or less ""shovel ready"", pending final permits.

Santa Ana

Bear Creek's secondary project, Santa Ana, is the most interesting one. Compared to Corani, Santa Ana is much smaller in scale (CapEx of just $70.8 million), but also more economical at today's low silver price environment, with average cash costs of $8.72/oz.

The Santa Ana project features a LOM of 11 years, with annual silver production projected to be 5.0 million oz/year (years 1-6), or 4.3 million oz/year (LOM).

Proven and probable mineral reserves include 63.2 million ounces of silver.

The following slide shows the highlights from the 2010 Feasibility Study:


Source: Bear Creek Mining Corporate Presentation

Although the economics for Santa Ana appear to work at this time, the problem with getting the mine into construction/production over the last few years actually has nothing to do with dollar figures at all; there's more to the story than just that.

The Santa Ana deposit is unique in the sense that it is located within a 50 km border zone in Peru that requires a foreign entity to obtain a Supreme Decree N° 032-2011-EM for operations.

In May of 2011:

""The Peruvian government agreed to put an end to a private mining project in Puno, following the deaths of five protesters in clashes with police on Friday.

The decision followed more than 10 hours of talks between government ministers and indigenous Aymara leaders as the two sides tried to put an end to an indefinite strike that has gripped Puno for a month. The protests are against mining and drilling concessions in the region.

On Saturday, a repeal of a 2007 decree that gave permission for the silver mine in Puno was officially repealed.

As a result, operations at the Santa Ana mine, owned by the Canadian Bear Creek Mining Corporation, were canceled. Also, the deal gives local indigenous communities the power to approve or deny any mining or drilling operations in the area. 'If the communities don't want mining, it can't be forced,' said Fernando Gala, vice minister of mines.""

This began a very lengthy battle, as the company worked to regain its lost operating permits at Santa Ana. In August 2014, a formal notice of Arbitration Action was initiated by the company, which is expected to drag on for the duration of 2016 and into 2017.


Source: Bear Creek Mining Corporate Presentation

Peruvian courts have already ruled in Bear Creek's favor on key issues.
Arbitration process concludes in 2016; ruling and damages award judgment anticipated within the second half of 2017.
Arbitration does not preclude Bear Creek and the Peruvian government from pursuing a settlement of the dispute.
In a most recent presentation in September 2015, Bear Creek Mining CEO Andrew Swarthout expressed confidence that the company would be able to obtain an award settlement with the Peruvian government to end the Santa Ana dispute. Requested damages are $525 million, which represent the value of the Santa Ana asset in 2011 at the time of the incident. According to Mr. Swarthout, the company would expect an arbitration award to fall in between 40% and 60% of the requested damages numbers, based off of previous award history data for mining assets. This would provide the company at a minimum of ~$200 million, which would presumably be used to help partially fund the construction of Corani.

Jurisdiction Risks

Although Bear Creek Mining has faced its share of issues and challenges with the Santa Ana project, as a whole, the country of Peru is generally regarded as a safe, hospitable region for mining. Granted, Peru will never be confused with first world jurisdictions such as Ontario or Quebec, but it does rank in the upper quartile globally. 


Source: Behre Dolbear 2015 Ranking of Countries for Mining Investment

Among many mineral deposits, Peru is home to the following: Antamina's (strategic partnership between BHP Billiton (NYSE:BBL) - 33.75%; Glencore (OTCPK:GLNCY) - 33.75%; Teck Resources (NYSE:TCK) - 22.5%; and Mitsubishi Corporation (OTCPK:MSBHY) - 10%) massive copper and zinc mine, Freeport-McMoRan's (NYSE:FCX) Cerro Verde copper and molybdenum mine, Hudbay's (NYSE:HBM) Constancia copper mine, and Southern Copper's (NYSE:SCCO) Toquepala copper mine, etc.

Peru is currently the sixth largest gold producing country in the world; it ranks third for both copper and zinc.

Balance Sheet Position

In a recent corporate presentation from September 2015, the company highlighted the following as a bullet (selling) point:

""4+ years working capital cash on hand (USD $26.5 M at Q2 2015) and no debt; G&amp;A cost-cutting ongoing to extend longevity.""

From the latest January 27, 2016, press release:

""General and administrative expenses are being lowered as much as possible, staffing levels are being reduced to core functions only, and the Company is preparing to replace a significant percentage of the cash component of director and management compensation with non-cash alternatives.""

The most recent February 2016 corporate slides now show $20 million of cash and no debt as of Q4 2015.

Upside Potential

The spot price of silver has performed admirably so far this year, up about 15% YTD. However, this does not tell the full story. Silver is often classified as a hybrid metal, part industrial (like copper), and part monetary (like gold). When push comes to shove, the most important question investors will want answered is ""Which direction will silver follow?""

To find out, let's chart the performance of the following holdings from January 04 up to February 11: the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:GLD), the iShares Silver Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:SLV), and the Global X Copper Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:COPX), along with BCEKF and base metal peers: BHP Billiton, and First Quantum Minerals (FM.TO) (OTCPK:FQVLF).


Here is what we find:

GLD up 17.35%
SLV up 13.33%
COPX down -17.19%
BCEKF up 30.57%
BBL down -17.78%
FM.TO down -43.24%
Since the major indices have all rallied hard these past few weeks, I selected a cut-off date of February 11, earlier this year, when the ""fear trade"" was more intense and base metal commodities were tanking. As can be clearly seen above, in the event of a market sell-off (when the ""fear trade"" is running rampant), silver and silver stocks will follow more the path of gold and perform like a monetary metal as opposed to that of an industrial metal like copper.

YTD, the performance of various silver stocks has been staggering: BCEKF, First Majestic Silver (NYSE:AG), Pan American Silver (NASDAQ:PAAS), Endeavour Silver (NYSE:EXK), and Alexco Resource (NYSEMKT:AXU).



BCEKF up 125%
AG up 105%
PAAS up 65%
EXK up 85%
AXU up 153%
They say that mining stocks lead the way of the physical metals when coming out of a bear market; if this is indeed the case, these silver stocks could be foreshadowing a more explosive move to the upside for the spot price of silver in the near future.

Downside Risks

As mentioned earlier, the company's core asset Corani is not currently economical at today's low metal prices. If this mini-rally in both silver and base metals starts to fade, shares of BCEKF could be under pressure again, potentially giving up some significant gains, which is what happened when the stock fell from $0.70/share to $0.34/share from October 14, 2015, to January 19, 2016.

Further, although the Santa Ana asset is currently in arbitration and the company feels confident that either the courts will rule in its favor or that a fair and just settlement with the Peruvian government can be reached in advance, there are no guarantees of either outcome.

With no other prospective exploration projects currently under development, and very limited capital available for funding (without further share dilution), the company's near-term success hinges heavily on events that are very much outside its own control.

These are some risks investors will need to carefully consider as they form their own investment thesis.

The Right Timing

At first glance, BCEKF may look like your typical start-up exploration stock, but Bear Creek Mining has actually been around for over a decade; this company (and its projects) is quite mature at this stage of the game. As such, shares have experienced their fair share of volatility - rising from infancy to a pre-subprime apex, to hitting rock bottom like every other stock post-Lehman in 2008, to surging back to another peak, riding the commodities bull into 2011, to finally dropping off a cliff again and hitting a nadir of $0.34/share earlier this past January.

What a rollercoaster ride, indeed...

Luckily, for any prospective shareholder who is just getting interested in the Bear Creek story today, shares are currently far closer to the bottom than any conceivable top (if we use history as a guide); this is most evident by not only revisiting the company's share price history, but also by looking into past press releases and observing the fact that the last financing deal was closed in 2010, when the company issued 17,650,000 common shares (the ""Common Shares"") at a price of $6.40 per common share for gross proceeds of $112,960,000.

Shares of BCEKF are currently trading for $0.949/share. While the stock has already doubled so far this year, with a current market capitalization of only $84 million and an enterprise value of $57 million, there is clearly still plenty of room to the upside for this stock with a rising silver price.

A benefit for anyone buying ""late"" into this story is that you'll be able to do so for ""pennies on the dollar."" Capital structure is tight, with only 93.1 million shares issued and outstanding and 101 million shares fully diluted. As mentioned above, the last financing in 2010 alone raised more capital than the entire company is worth today.

Past performance is not indicative of future success, but not too long ago, BCEKF was trading at over $11/share in 2011. Interestingly enough, it is worth noting that exploration/development-stage companies like Bear Creek Mining have led the way in 2016 and outperformed the mid-tier silver producers thus far YTD.

Doing Next to Nothing

Bear Creek Mining is a company that is flying under most everyone's radar right now. With metal prices having been caught in a perpetual slump since 2011, the company has more or less gone into full-blown ""hibernation mode."" For instance, in the case of Corani, now that the resource has been refined by the way of the latest July 2015 Final Optimized Feasibility Study, no further work is currently pending (outside of obtaining final permits); the ounces in the ground aren't going anywhere, so it makes sense as to why the company has decided to continue doing exactly what it has been doing over the last six months... as little as possible.

In a brutal downmarket, doing ""next to nothing"" is probably the right thing to do; it makes little sense to dilute your shareholders by attempting to raise more funds at a time when the markets won't be rewarding you for any additional work you undertake on your projects. But unlike a producer that has to service debt and pay for mine operating costs constantly, an exploration company like Bear Creek (with an advanced-stage deposit defined but not in construction) has the ""luxury"" of being able to essentially close up shop until better days return.

Conclusion

Although it would be easy to do so, investors should not lose track of the Bear Creek Mining story. Now that the spot price of silver is starting to move in the positive direction again, silver stocks have started to follow, and BCEKF is no exception.

With a market cap of only $81 million, decent cash in the bank, no debt, 228 million ounces of silver reserves held at Corani, a potential ~$200 million award awaiting Santa Ana, etc., Bear Creek Mining provides tremendous leverage to the upside for anyone hoping to capitalize on an advancing silver price.

Yes, it is true that this bear has been in a deep slumber these past few years, but that time may be fast approaching an end; Bear Creek Mining is just starting to wake up again, and thus shares of BCEKF may be ready to roar.

Among many mineral deposits, Peru is home to the following: Antamina's (strategic partnership between BHP Billiton (NYSE:BBL) - 33.75%; Glencore (OTCPK:GLNCY) - 33.75%; Teck Resources (NYSE:TCK) - 22.5%; and Mitsubishi Corporation (OTCPK:MSBHY) - 10%) massive copper and zinc mine, Freeport-McMoRan's (NYSE:FCX) Cerro Verde copper and molybdenum mine, Hudbay's (NYSE:HBM) Constancia copper mine, and Southern Copper's (NYSE:SCCO) Toquepala copper mine, etc.
Peru is currently the sixth largest gold producing country in the world; it ranks third for both copper and zinc.
Balance Sheet Position
In a recent corporate presentation from September 2015, the company highlighted the following as a bullet (selling) point:
""4+ years working capital cash on hand (USD $26.5 M at Q2 2015) and no debt; G&amp;A cost-cutting ongoing to extend longevity.""
From the latest January 27, 2016, press release:
""General and administrative expenses are being lowered as much as possible, staffing levels are being reduced to core functions only, and the Company is preparing to replace a significant percentage of the cash component of director and management compensation with non-cash alternatives.""
The most recent February 2016 corporate slides now show $20 million of cash and no debt as of Q4 2015.
Upside Potential
The spot price of silver has performed admirably so far this year, up about 15% YTD. However, this does not tell the full story. Silver is often classified as a hybrid metal, part industrial (like copper), and part monetary (like gold). When push comes to shove, the most important question investors will want answered is ""Which direction will silver follow?""
To find out, let's chart the performance of the following holdings from January 04 up to February 11: the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:GLD), the iShares Silver Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:SLV), and the Global X Copper Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:COPX), along with BCEKF and base metal peers: BHP Billiton, and First Quantum Minerals (FM.TO) (OTCPK:FQVLF).
Here is what we find:
GLD up 17.35% SLV up 13.33% COPX down -17.19% BCEKF up 30.57% BBL down -17.78% FM.TO down -43.24% Since the major indices have all rallied hard these past few weeks, I selected a cut-off date of February 11, earlier this year, when the ""fear trade"" was more intense and base metal commodities were tanking. As can be clearly seen above, in the event of a market sell-off (when the ""fear trade"" is running rampant), silver and silver stocks will follow more the path of gold and perform like a monetary metal as opposed to that of an industrial metal like copper.
YTD, the performance of various silver stocks has been staggering: BCEKF, First Majestic Silver (NYSE:AG), Pan American Silver (NASDAQ:PAAS), Endeavour Silver (NYSE:EXK), and Alexco Resource (NYSEMKT:AXU).
BCEKF up 125% AG up 105% PAAS up 65% EXK up 85% AXU up 153% They say that mining stocks lead the way of the physical metals when coming out of a bear market; if this is indeed the case, these silver stocks could be foreshadowing a more explosive move to the upside for the spot price of silver in the near future.
Downside Risks
As mentioned earlier, the company's core asset Corani is not currently economical at today's low metal prices. If this mini-rally in both silver and base metals starts to fade, shares of BCEKF could be under pressure again, potentially giving up some significant gains, which is what happened when the stock fell from $0.70/share to $0.34/share from October 14, 2015, to January 19, 2016.
Further, although the Santa Ana asset is currently in arbitration and the company feels confident that either the courts will rule in its favor or that a fair and just settlement with the Peruvian government can be reached in advance, there are no guarantees of either outcome.
With no other prospective exploration projects currently under development, and very limited capital available for funding (without further share dilution), the company's near-term success hinges heavily on events that are very much outside its own control.
These are some risks investors will need to carefully consider as they form their own investment thesis.
The Right Timing
At first glance, BCEKF may look like your typical start-up exploration stock, but Bear Creek Mining has actually been around for over a decade; this company (and its projects) is quite mature at this stage of the game. As such, shares have experienced their fair share of volatility - rising from infancy to a pre-subprime apex, to hitting rock bottom like every other stock post-Lehman in 2008, to surging back to another peak, riding the commodities bull into 2011, to finally dropping off a cliff again and hitting a nadir of $0.34/share earlier this past January.
What a rollercoaster ride, indeed...
Luckily, for any prospective shareholder who is just getting interested in the Bear Creek story today, shares are currently far closer to the bottom than any conceivable top (if we use history as a guide); this is most evident by not only revisiting the company's share price history, but also by looking into past press releases and observing the fact that the last financing deal was closed in 2010, when the company issued 17,650,000 common shares (the ""Common Shares"") at a price of $6.40 per common share for gross proceeds of $112,960,000.
Shares of BCEKF are currently trading for $0.949/share. While the stock has already doubled so far this year, with a current market capitalization of only $84 million and an enterprise value of $57 million, there is clearly still plenty of room to the upside for this stock with a rising silver price.
A benefit for anyone buying ""late"" into this story is that you'll be able to do so for ""pennies on the dollar."" Capital structure is tight, with only 93.1 million shares issued and outstanding and 101 million shares fully diluted. As mentioned above, the last financing in 2010 alone raised more capital than the entire company is worth today.
Past performance is not indicative of future success, but not too long ago, BCEKF was trading at over $11/share in 2011. Interestingly enough, it is worth noting that exploration/development-stage companies like Bear Creek Mining have led the way in 2016 and outperformed the mid-tier silver producers thus far YTD.
Doing Next to Nothing
Bear Creek Mining is a company that is flying under most everyone's radar right now. With metal prices having been caught in a perpetual slump since 2011, the company has more or less gone into full-blown ""hibernation mode."" For instance, in the case of Corani, now that the resource has been refined by the way of the latest July 2015 Final Optimized Feasibility Study, no further work is currently pending (outside of obtaining final permits); the ounces in the ground aren't going anywhere, so it makes sense as to why the company has decided to continue doing exactly what it has been doing over the last six months... as little as possible.
In a brutal downmarket, doing ""next to nothing"" is probably the right thing to do; it makes little sense to dilute your shareholders by attempting to raise more funds at a time when the markets won't be rewarding you for any additional work you undertake on your projects. But unlike a producer that has to service debt and pay for mine operating costs constantly, an exploration company like Bear Creek (with an advanced-stage deposit defined but not in construction) has the ""luxury"" of being able to essentially close up shop until better days return.
Conclusion
Although it would be easy to do so, investors should not lose track of the Bear Creek Mining story. Now that the spot price of silver is starting to move in the positive direction again, silver stocks have started to follow, and BCEKF is no exception.
With a market cap of only $81 million, decent cash in the bank, no debt, 228 million ounces of silver reserves held at Corani, a potential ~$200 million award awaiting Santa Ana, etc., Bear Creek Mining provides tremendous leverage to the upside for anyone hoping to capitalize on an advancing silver price.
Yes, it is true that this bear has been in a deep slumber these past few years, but that time may be fast approaching an end; Bear Creek Mining is just starting to wake up again, and thus shares of BCEKF may be ready to roar.

16-03-22,4bibc9,Update: Equities Lab Black Box Investing,"Hey everyone,

so a couple months ago I posted a thread asking if anyone knew of a place that I could purchase black box strategies, or really strategies that I had help building from people who actually know what they are doing quantitatively, and you guys were really helpful. I then posted that a company named Equities Lab had reached out to me and informed me that they offered such a service. It was a little pricey (roughly $300/month) but it's still cheaper than if I hired a phd student to do the work. 

We've volleyed multiple phone calls back and forth in terms of building strategies and they've been super helpful. I did some research on them and they are a super small company(I only ever talked to two people - the founder Henry, and their head of marketing Tyler) Henry is far more quantitative than Tyler but Tyler did offer ideas that neither Henry or I had thought of. 

So after all of these calls we have finally finished a couple of different strategies that I'll be implementing into few of my clients portfolios to continue testing them out. Both of the strategies that I'm implementing have worked for 20 years so the probability of a strategy completely blowing up is extremely slim. And even when they do blow up... because everything blows up, I'll just give them a call again and we will make more. As an example I'm posting the results of my favorite of the two strategies. 

Strategy - Results from 1995:

*Over 100 results from the screen

*10.74% annualized return

*2.66% average monthly standard deviation


http://puu.sh/nPVOO/2b5f62e01a.png


Anyway, I just wanted to give an update on what's been happening these past couple of months. Have a good day everyone. 

I got a couple messages about the landing page for the strategies. They aren't currently selling to just anyone so they told me to post this link for people. https://www.equitieslab.com/black-box-qualification/ Pretty much, give them a call if you're interested and they will decide whether to sign you up at that level.

Who in 2016 still buys video games at a fucking store where the games go for $60, when you can buy them online for a fraction, or wait for Steam sale, and you often find yourself pre-ordering from said store just to see your pre-order being cancelled? Fuck Gamestop.

=
EPS forecast for the quarter is $2.25

=
Ok let's look at their quarterly earnings:


http://investor.gamestop.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=130125&amp;p=quarterlyearnings

Shit is dropping left and right. The general trend is downward if you compare year to year quarterly results EXCEPT for Q1 of course... But we are talking Q4, and shit don't look good. A beautiful downwards trend (see Q4 results pg 32).

Surprise history tends to be[ low for winterish quarters](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/gme) so you know you get ready for that disappointment.

HOWEVER!!! Fucking annual results tell a different story. Now there is no pattern and it seems Gamestop has been fluctuating around certain values. Revenue is always around $9 billion +/- $500 million in the past 5 years, net profit around $3 +/- .50 per share. That makes things interesting. If the EPS forecast ($2.25) is a severe underestimation of Gamestop, we could see that shit explode dramatically going back to the low $40s. If it's not, we could see see Gamestop tank like nothing before.


=
My recommendation: Unless you know more info, get a cheap strangle or for you poor people, buy some GME Apr 01 2016 33.5 Calls (IV=70) and GME Apr 01 2016 27.50 Puts (IV=72). Both cost around $.33 right now. If shit goes up, your put is worthless, but the gains from the  calls should make up for it. If shit goes down, your puts will pay for your calls. Well that's the theory at least. In both cases, your maximum loss is 100%, but if your options reach ITM status, your minimum gain is at least 300%. This is assuming the stock will gain or lose 10% in response to the ER, naively ignoring the potentially massive IV crush that happens by holding your fucking options over the extended weekend. My personal sentiment is towards an ER disappointment due to 3 things:

1. I think they will show bad sales as people are moving towards digital sales and purchases that out-compete them.

2. Even if they do well, this ER may already be priced in, triggering a selloff rather than a buying spree aka good news = sell off, bad news = sell off.

3. Last quarter was pretty slow for video games. No major releases should have a negative effect on Gamestop sales. Their biggest years were during the time when PS4 and Xbone were released.

But, with my luck the exact opposite will happen so you might just want to go ahead and buy calls for shits and giggles and love to do the exact opposite of what wsb do if you can't afford to buy both. 

=
Disclaimers:

REMEMBER ER is AH Thursday and there is no trading on Friday so buying this week's weeklies thinking that you can ride them into Friday or something would be a hilariously retarded thing to do. Please don't.

Also beware of the volume of those options. Seems kinda dry there and if the stock doesn't violently move either way, it could get even drier. Bid and ask spread is very bad too unless you're willing to wait for someone to pick up your shares.

Also again reminding that the IV crush over an extended weekend is a REAL thing. Don't misunderestimate it. Good luck.",6

Recently I made a tool that analyzes a certain stock and return its f-score (http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/piotroski-score.asp). I've come to realize that this tool is very helpful in picking out good stocks or even just getting a value for a stock you've been thinking about investing at.

Anyhow, what I had in mind is creating a tool that analyzes stocks and performs different proven strategies (such as the f-score, altman Z etc) to value a stock, or even just return its value by these strategies alone. Here are a few proven ones that I've been looking into: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XUv2yEWrcJM_w0JM4cOyrZxiv19CGbVVw1h5J-0pZwk/pub?single=true&amp;gid=0&amp;output=html.

This was at best incompetence and at worst shady reporting practices. It dropped that day and I figured it would be in for more trouble, but ever since it has increased by 20% the past few weeks. These are pretty big mistakes in growth numbers, a key argument of Ackman is that it is a pyramid scheme and eventually new member growth will dry up.

http://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/displayfilinginfo.aspx?filingid=11229862&amp;tabindex=2&amp;type=html

Extract for those who don't want to read it.  

&gt;We are currently finalizing our financial results for the quarter and year ended January 30, 2016. Complete financial information is not available and will not be final until we complete our financial closing procedures. Based on information currently available, and in light of this offering, we are providing the preliminary estimates for the quarter and year ended January 30, 2016:

&gt;•  Total net sales for the fourth quarter are expected to be approximately $3.5 billion to $3.55 billion, which would reflect growth of 0.7% to 2.1% compared to the $3.48 billion in net sales in the fourth quarter of the prior year (4.5% to 6.0% in constant currency). Net sales in the quarter reflected 32 Video Game Brands stores opened (with 73 closed) and 213 Technology Brands stores opened or acquired (with 11 closed) and an expected 3.1% increase in comparable store sales.

&gt;•  Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately the same or slightly higher than $434 million from the fourth quarter of 2014.

&gt;•  Earnings per share are expected to exceed the previously disclosed range of $2.19 to $2.25 per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, based on a diluted share count of approximately 105.0 million weighted average common shares outstanding. These results compared to earnings per share of $2.23 in the fourth quarter of the prior year, which included an $0.08 per share net benefit related to the closure of our operations in Spain and store impairments.

&gt;•  We had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL facility and we estimate that we had cash and cash equivalents of $450.0 million at period end.

&gt;These expected ranges are preliminary and may change. We have not finalized our normal quarterly and annual closing and review procedures for the quarter and year ending January 30, 2016, and there can be no assurance that final results for our fourth quarter or annual period will not differ from our expected results due to the completion of our final closing procedures, audit adjustments and other developments that may arise between the date of this offering memorandum and the time of completion of our financial results. These expected results could change materially and are not necessarily indicative of the results to be achieved for our fourth quarter or any future period.

This is the same filing in which they announced their intention to go $475M into debt to purchase between 450-500 AT&amp;T stores.  That number of stores would increase their footprint by 7%.

So, to sum up, they are going to beat their current earnings estimate, as described in Yahoo Finance of 2.25/sh.  For forward guidance, I believe they will announce between 4-11% growth based on the 7% increase in the number of store fronts and their normal 2-4% growth.  

If that isn't enough to get investors excited to price this stock at greater than a P/E ratio of 8 that it currently sits at, I don't know what would.  At their current P/E ratio the stock price should be around $32/sh.  If the earnings get investors excited enough about GME’s growth that they go back to the PE of 12 from last summer, it could hit $48/share.

That won’t happen quickly, so buy options with expirations as late as you can stand.  Don’t let Thurston Howell the Third at Goldman Sacks pull a “Square” on you and start buying the date after the standard expiration of options.

Because I wear an aluminum foil hat and am afraid of Thurston, I will share my trades after I sell.  (He’ll still know based on the computer algorithm he’s used in the past to thwart my brilliant set ups in the past, but at least I won’t be telling him directly).

Going in with no puts.  YOLO… ish, since I really won’t be going all in.

As a sidenote…  I know there is some resistance to investing in companies with an actual storefront, and for those thinking that everybody is going digital, I have one question, why do book stores still exist today?  It may be going out of style, but for the next 5+ years, there will still be brick and mortar.
And, when this trade goes sour, I will leave this post here for others to mock and hopefully learn from.

Fuck you very much.

Edit:  Also forgot to mention the amount of short interest in this stock.  When it beats on earnings and forward guidance, the shorts (which stands at about 44% of float) will be forced to cover, forcing this stock even higher.  Thanks to /u/badvices7 for mentioning it in another post.",5

Here is some DD:
You remember $EDIT and CRISPR? how it was going to change the world through gene editing? And how they climbed 3x after IPO? While $Edit is correct when it comes to academic lab research, when it comes to clinical products, all they have is a patent war and competition with two already existing technologies, zinc finger nucleases (ZFN, $SGMO) and TALEN ($CLLS). Yet wall street and retail have collectively creamed their pants over it. 

When it comes to clinical products, none of the advantages of CRISPR tech (how fast you can design a CRISPR, how many genes you can target simultaneously) actually matter currently. Any gene editing therapy in the pipeline now and in the foreseeable futute goes through a long dev process to validate safety and targets a single gene. 

SGMO currently has multiple products in the pipeline, several in phase I and one in phase II with multiple IND apps to FDA (that means more phase I trials to start soon) due this year. There are multiple data releases this year as well. In all, this is SGMO's biggest year in its existence so far and its trading near all-time lows. 

SGMO has 200m in cash and projects to end this year with approximately 150m. 

Im in since 5.08, current price 5.96. Will be riding this train all the way to 9 like i did back in nov.

Short-term: good YOLO

Medium-term: risky YOLO - depends on data

Long-term: potentially yacht-level YOLO (first company to have true gene editing product to clinic will win big, SGMO is closest and has the largest pipeline)",1

16-03-23,4bm79u,Help understanding Australian takeover of UK-listed stock,"Hi all,

I own shares in Amara Mining, listed in London, UK. They're subject to a takeover/merger with Australian-based Perseus Mining. I understood that the outcome of this is 0.68 New Perseus share and 0.34 New warrant per share of Amara held. Today I received a communication from Lloyds Bank Direct Investments, the relevant part of which I quote below. I don't fully understand it, and can't find much about ""Depositary Interest"" other than it being a way for UK traders to hold foreign shares. Will be effectively unable to sell my ""New Perseus"" shares, or is this just a formality? I'm inclined to try and exit my position in advance of this happening at the minute, because I don't fully understand what it means!

Thanks, and apologies if this is the wrong place to ask this.

&gt; Prior to the Scheme becoming effective, an application will be made to the London Stock Exchange for the cancellation of listing of the Amara shares on the Alternative Investment Market. Subsequently, the cancellation of admission to trading is expected to become effective within 5 days of the Scheme Hearing Date with the last day in dealings expected to be on the same date as the Court Hearing.
&gt; The Scheme Proceeds are expected to be credited to your account approximately 15 days following the Court Hearing Date. You will, however, be notified.
&gt; Unless you hold your shares in a ShareBuilder account, no fractions of New Perseus shares will be issued. Any resulting cash entitlements will be dealt with in accordance with our Terms &amp; Conditions.
&gt; The warrants will provide for eligible shareholders to subscribe for New Perseus shares at AUD0.44 for up to 36 months after the date of issue of such warrant. The warrants will not be quoted on any financial market but may be transferable.
&gt; Please be aware that, unlike the Amara shares, the New Perseus shares are not capable of being registered, transferred or settled directly through the UK settlement system.
&gt; A Depositary Interest (DIs) arrangement will therefore be established to overcome this.
&gt; The DIs will only be admitted to trading on the Australian Stock Exchange until such time that the Company endeavours to seek a listing on the London Stock Exchange's Official List. There can, however, be no guarantee of this being successful and could take up to 12 months to obtain if so.
&gt; As a result, it is likely that there will be a significant period of time for which we will be unable to facilitate any trading in the Perseus shares via our sharedealing facility.",8

16-03-24,4bpjmf,$ZFGN to get BTFO?,"Zafagen is pretty much exclusively working on Beloranib, a MetAP2 antagonist and angiogenesis inhibitor, which means they're treating fat people like they pretty much have cancer. The idea is that MetAP2 is an angiogenic factor, Beloranib inhibits angiogenesis, and that somehow kills fat cells. I spent a good 2 hours looking at the review paper before throwing up my hands since they give no reasonable explanation to the mechanisms. The only real research ever given out touts the amazing weight-loss effects of Beloranib in mouse models and recently human clinical trials. 

Here's a paper I will keep talking about: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3944999/

Here's the kicker, we have no real idea where the fat is going. My idea is that reducing angiogenesis starves the fat cells and they blow up, releasing triglycerides into the bloodstream. I really hope that's not the case because those triglycerides would get stored in the liver and pancreas and directly result in or worsen diabetes. The paper claims people just burn them off and piss them out, there's a very big problem with that assumption though: the human body really does not have fat excretion pathways (since our ancestors really needed every calorie they could get) any angiogenesis inhibitor is going to prevent any number of ways people can burn shit off. The paper mentions that Beloranib treatment reduces vascularization of brown adipose tissue, an organ that literally uptakes glucose and triglycerides from the bloodstream to burn off as heat (for a number of physiological reasons). While the paper claims that brown adipose tissue is irrelevant, there's quite a bit of evidence showing that adults have quite a bit of functional brown adipose tissue, and that it's presence is inversely correlated with body weight, and that people who don't have it leads to glucose intolerance. Meanwhile, reduced angiogenesis means that exercise will be miserable, since tissue repair and feeding muscles with blood is inhibited. I would predict that anyone on Beloranib will feel miserable lazy and shitty. Finally, reduced angiogenesis straight up is harmful to the heart. I'm amazed that these papers can claim that cardiovascular indications improve because the peripheral resistance against blood flow (and blood pressure) should go past the moon. That's an even worse problem in obese patients, whose hearts are usually pretty fucked to begin with. 

There's also two dead people. Mind you, they had Willie-Prader syndrome which is pretty dangerous to begin with, but these patients died from pulmonary embolism. Worst case scenario, this drug is flooding the bloodstream with floating free-fatty-acids, and they clog up the arteries, go to the lungs, and bang. Don't forget that since this drug inhibits angiogenesis you are already more vulnerable to this sort of shit. FDA has put the whole study on hold, and if the drug is directly linked to the deaths, I can't see any more studies going forward. 

What do we have in the end? A drug company with a drug that makes no sense, two dead patients, and an FDA hold. I'm betting that next week's results will be mediocre at best, damning at worst. ",17

The only variables based on assumptions are Growth (e.g. Revenue growth CAGR 5yr or something modified) and the Market Hurdle Rate, which is probably something like GDP growth + historic stock market return of around 6%. I think with this way one can quickly see priced-in-growth rates. An alternative for the market hurdle rate would be GDP+Market E/P. Does anyone use this valuation method and if so, does anyone have a good alternative of the Perpetual Growth rate? Or are there any recommendations? (I do not want to use the standard DCF as it just to unstable given any slight errors.)

After my beating on VRX earnings last week I'm slowly crawling out of the emotional ""negativity hole"" and trying to remain positive and look for opportunities again. I've had my eye on LCI for quite some time, and fundamentally they're starting to look like a fantastic play.

Stock is down today due to some projects being pushed back to 2017 and some downward revised estimates for 2016 (edit: forgot a few analyst downgrades, too). Stock dropped 20% a while back when these revisions were announced, so I am kind of shocked to see it react so strongly today. EPS, P/E, Net Income, Debt... everything about this stock looks good... except the stock price. Some dislike the CEO because they had a botched integration and a loss of a large customer from an acquisition (Kremers Pharm) over the last year and that's driven a lot of the decline, but sell-off's in pharm in general have produced a hit. I've seen LCI around here a few times, but not very frequently. If anyone else follows this stock and can provide their own take, I'm happy to hear other sides to this story as well. Anyone like to have a conversation about LCI or other generic pharm manufacturers in general?

I bought a *small* amount at $22 and change to dip my toes in the water while I researched the stock and it's financial position a bit more. They're well capitalized and have plenty of liquidity, no risk of financial troubles, just some intermediate hiccups (which may present a buying opportunity) from all I can tell.

Now, if you had better market timing, you could have made a 30%+ profit in under a month... but you also could have had worse timing.  And it's very difficult/unlikely to pick the exact bottom.

Say I invested into a MF for $10,000 for 100 shares at $100 per share. 

Grows over time, reinvest dividends. 

2 years later, total earnings drop from $10,000 to $9,000, but I now have 110 shares (because of reinvesting dividends) but at $81.81 per share now because of drop. 

Because of the additional shares that I now own (110), doesn't the share price only have to return to $90, as opposed to the original $100 per share, for me to break even and not lose money?

110 shares, multiplied by the new goal share price of $90 = $10,000. I essentially lost no money. Is this thinking correct?

**Asset Allocation:**

More information about me: I'm 19 years old, graduating from community college, going to start a 4 year degree next year at a well known, expensive university. I already own my car outright and live at my parents house with around 200-250 a month in expenses. **My biggest holdings are as follows:**

16-03-24,4bqmps,[Conspiracy Theory] Credit Suisse,"I just ran across this today, and who knows if it's true, but I like the idea.

Remember [**this chart**](http://i.imgur.com/smqREcM.jpg)?  The obvious question is: What caused SKEW to fall off a cliff all of a sudden?  VIX didn't die down till a month later, about the same time that the S&amp;P started its huge rally.

&amp;nbsp;

In case you haven't heard, Credit Suisse has to reduce their leverage from the current level of $380 billion, down to $290 billion by end of 2016, according to Bloomberg.

Then there's [**this Bloomberg**](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-23/credit-suisse-ceo-blindsided-as-bank-added-to-risky-positions) article about Credit Suisse having huge, risky, highly leveraged positions, though they only mention other asset types like bonds, swaps, and MBS.

This was the quote that caught my eye:
&gt;Trading revenue may drop 40 percent to 45 percent in the first quarter, the bank said. The drop could have been worse, as [CEO] Thiam said he found out about the positions in **January** and *moved to limit the damage.*

&amp;nbsp;

If he ""moved to limit the damage"" in **mid**-January that would be a nice coincidence.  Is it possible that part of reducing their leverage was selling off equities?  Another theory might be that the US equity side was a hedge against either big commodity trades, or foreign equities.  

*It sounds like no one even knows what categories their distressed and overleveraged assets belong to right now, and obviously this has a slim likelyhood of being true - but I enjoyed the idea.*  

There have been quite a few high-profile stories about traders making ever riskier and larger bets to cover positions gone wrong, and it's easy to believe that a rogue trader or department could cause huge waves of market volatility.  Then it would suddenly stop when they were caught by their boss and told to deleverage or liquidate the positions.

&amp;nbsp;

Even if the theory has no basis though, there's a possibility that 2016 could get pretty rocky if Credit Suisse tries to dump illiquid positions and can't find buyers at normal prices. A problem like that in bonds or MBS could easily cascade into the equity markets.",14

Although I wouldn't necessarily change anything I wrote about the growth of the solar industry, nor about the prospects for SCTY, I did start looking at other companies that offer PV solutions.

What I don't understand is why a company like First Solar trades at 2X revenue, when it's already profitable, and hardly has any profit. It also currently earns around 10X the revenue of SolarCity. SCTY, on the other hand trades at 10X revenue today, it's debt/assets is closer to 40%.

16-03-23,4bnh8y,[repost] Why I bought SCTY at $20,"I had to repost this since the last one got blocked for some reason. Initially submitted 1 month ago.

* Solar City is the most vertically integrated solar company in the world. They're cutting out all the middle men from the sales, engineering, financing, and installation of their solar panels. This will allow them to offer the cheapest cost/Watt of any of the solar companies. If anyone will become profitable in this space in the long-run, it's them.
* It's already the leading solar company in the US, with 36% of the residential market share, 8% of the commercial market share. SCTY's fist-mover advantage positions them well in this growing market for the foreseeable future, even if growth is slowing.
* Their business model makes sense for the consumer since there's literally 0 risk for them. Reduce your energy bill over 30 years, without the expensive down payment of the panels. The economics of their business model has been debated on this forum and in many articles. I think it's similar to when Paypal was paying people to sign up and use their service.
* Still a HUGE growth potential. only 1% of the houses in the US have solar panels. 2015 saw the fastest growth of solar electricity in the US, and it doesn't look like it's slowing.
* Their price / book is the lowest it's ever been (hovering around 3 right now). Maybe it will go lower, to me, this seems to be low for this type of company.
* Their installations were a bit lower than expected, almost entirely due to Nevada legislation. And they didn't even miss by that much. Revenue is slightly up, operating costs were lower than expected, and their 2016 guidance has not changed.

The big IF is whether they can transition to a sustainable business model, which needs to happen in 2016, while management says it's a priority. There are a lot of risks for this company. SCTY will have difficulties raising more debt. It can either issue more shares, or write more solar bonds, but the current market conditions for both options look bad. The tax incentives are also going to dry up, putting pressure on their margins. There is also the risk that large Utilities invest heavily in the renewable energy space.

I reckon this investment is not for the faint of heart. The price swings a lot, and it may take years until the company becomes a home-run. I guess it all depends on what you think about how management is faring given the circumstances they are in.",1

DD:

TA, Travelcenters of America is in the glamorous cutting-edge business of operating truckstops, convenience stores, and quick service restaurants.  Their stock has been beaten up badly lately as they have ""missed"" on earnings 4 quarters in a row.  Management doesn’t give guidance so the misses I think are just poorly formed analyst expectations.  To be surprised by any of the quarterly results must mean completely ignoring what's happening in oil prices and what management says their intentions are on the conference calls.  With this being such a small company it's not surprising analysts don't spend much time on it.

With their primary product line being fuel their gross revenue is tied to the price of gasoline.  Even though they sold more gallons of gas than last year their top line revenue figures are way down because those are based solely on the current gas price.  Also, they got ridiculously good margins in 2014 when oil prices crashed quickly.  They lower prices in response to crude oil drops more slowly than they would raise prices when oil goes up.  In Q4 2014 they had gross margins of 28 cents per gallon, vs. 15-17 cents like it usually is.  

No matter what they were going to miss in comparison to 2014, but 2015 Q4 actually showed a net loss which may have been a little shocking.  However, they had much higher expenses related to the purchase of hundreds of convenience stores that happened in the last four months of the year.  There were a lot of both site-level and overhead expenses associated with those purchases and it will take a few quarters before they start really throwing off cash.  So I would continue to expect poor near term results and longer-term outperformance.

The stock trades more erratically than I think the option pricing gives it credit for.  It started the year near 10, dropped to 6.41, rallied to 9.50, and now has dropped back to 6.50 again earnings.  I'm biased because I think it's worth a solid 15 a share anyway, but I think it's reasonably likely it could randomly find its way back over 9 in the next three weeks even without a clear catalyst.  I paid 15 cents a contract, but you can pick them up for 10 cents now.  If it can get to 9 my options would be worth 10x what I paid, or 15x what they are worth now.

You should also be aware there are lots of related party transactions that many find suspicious for good reason.  You can find a recent article on seeking alpha that addresses these, although I don't fully agree with the author's conclusions.  In any case, I wouldn't get married to the stock, but I like the call options for their asymmetric risk.  Buying options further away from expiration may be the wiser play at this point, but with how negatively the price has responded to earnings reports I'm probably just stick with the monthlies for now.

16-03-25,4bx2e9,Contributing to a 2015 Roth IRA via Vanguard,"Reddit team,

Before April 15, I'd like to invest $5,500 to a Roth IRA for 2015. I use Vanguard via everyone's recommendation about low fees, etc. I have two questions I was hoping you all could help me with:

1. I'm looking to dump the funds into my account today. I don't want to immediately invest it into a fund as I want time to research what options I have and might be interested in this year. I'm not seeing the option to simply transfer funds into my Roth IRA account... aka just put the cash in without fees or anything. I only see the option to 'Buy' into funds. Is there no way to simply get the cash in and I can invest it later? The default option is called 'Prime Money Market'... I had my cash in this for a year and it did nothing, so I'm wondering if that's where they let cash just sit? Point is, I'd like to put my $5,500 in, but not invest it into something until I know exactly where I want it, and therefore avoid transaction fees from switching later on after research.

2. In previous years, I've put everything in this account into a 'Target Retirement 2050' account. I'm wondering if this is a good option? If I should diversify a bit, maybe I should put this past year's $5,500 elsewhere? Anyone have any specific funds they're liking and could explain it to me please? I'm fairly new at all of this. Any tips / advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you so much and invest on! ",1

16-03-24,4btowv,(SIAF) Selling well below bankruptcy value.,"It's market value is 199 million according to stock price. However it has 532,687,000 in total assets, 70,459,000 in total liabilities. Which means if they went bankrupt today their share price would go up! and they would be valued for 263,228,000 million more than they are today.


Their accounts receivable is high, but even if you discount it to 0 the total assets - total liabilities is greater than the enterprise value.


So the only reason I can think of for the price being so low is that people are worried about the chines economy or the accounting practices. The company main source of income is sea food and cattle, so the rising middle class will probably still be buying. For the accounting practices they had to file with the SEC and they have been audited in 2013 and 2104.

The delta's are absolutely insane. .18 delta for a $2 contract on Friday or $.1 delta for a $2 contract on Thursday. A $10 move on SPX gives a 200% return, and so on.

Company Info:
--
Iconix is a brand managment company behind pretty much all the no-brand clothes you find at Walmart, Burlington Coat Factory, JC-Penneys, Macy's, Target, those Chinese/Korean outlets in the middle of a mall in the ghetto. Pretty much anything that is not a major brand is under the wing of this conglomerate.

Products:
--
Textiles, Apparel &amp; Luxury Goods such as fragrances and mobile games and apps, in other words anything related to fashion that goes with or can be put on fabrics, that's their field. The brands that Iconix owns include: Joe Boxer, Rocawear, Candie's, Bongos, Material Girl, Peanuts, Mark Ecko, Zoo York, Lee Cooper, Strawberry Shortcake. The brand logos can be found on their website ([check it out](http://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_45112813.png)). I challenge you to check your wardrobe against these and you probably have bought one of these non-brands for yourself or your kids or a significant other. On top of that they make ridiculous money just licensing those brands for things like apps, especially games. Needless to say, they are here to stay as long as we maintain a culture in which nudity is frowned upon.

Past Events:

Nov 6, 2015

Now here is where it gets fun. 

1. Following an accounting review by a special committee of the company's board of directors, Iconix announced that it would need to restate some of its financial results from fiscal 2013, 2014, and the first two quarters of 2015 in order to correct accounting errors (oh-oh). What followed was the obvious crash that made this stock plummet from its [usual $16 range to $6.90](https://www.google.com/finance?cid=361840) (AH) or -57%. Because seriously, lying about financial is like the ultimate sin at the stock market and there is little mercy.


2. Inconix also provided preliminary results for the third quarter, which will include three special items: It will take a $12.2 million charge to increase reserves related to its accounts receivables. A $3.8 million tax-related charge will be taken to correct an error in the company's 2014 federal tax return.  The company will take $7.1 million in charges related to the accounting review, correspondence with the SEC, and severance costs related to the transition of the company's management.


3. Lastly, Iconix slashed its guidance for the full year. Licensing revenue is expected to be between $370 million and $380 million, down from a previous range of $410 million to $425 million. 

4. Nonetheless the CEO is all like: Look, at least we came out. The cat is out of the sack, there you go. It's not like we gonna go away. We will recover from that. Obviously he didn't literally say that, but read between the lines

Fast forward to 2016



Since then, they have done some major rebranding (new website), changed their business strategy and cleaned up their financials, and restructured their boards ([Source](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9NTk4ODkzfENoaWxkSUQ9MzA5NDcwfFR5cGU9MQ==&amp;t=1)).

My opinion:
--
We have seen how Aeropostale ($ARO) and Nike ($NKE) have taken a shit already so it's easy to be cynical that they probably also shat the bed last year and last quarter. But unlike Aeropostale, they don't have stores to maintain and employ that drain them out and unlike Nike, ICON is not a blue chip with ultra high expectations. At a market cap of $390 million and a worst case scenario of expected revenues of $370-380 million, can this really get any lower? The general sentiment is neither buying nor selling the stock, but rather just holding. But, I think it might be worth getting a position into this company because other than the accounting errors, they make consistent gains, they did get their shit together, and now that they are branching out into mobile apps with their tiny microtransactions that rake in millions, and sold some brands, I'm bullish. If you don't want to take the risk, at least buy some far in the future OTM calls after the ER. Whether the ER is great or not, this will go back north of $10 this year.


Edit ER:

1. MU's Forward Price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is 7.42
This means that within roughly 7.4 earnings periods based on future projections, Micron's current price of $10.65 will have 'earned' its keep. Other tech companies have MUCH more EXPENSIVE valuations (see: Amazon, Though it has a steady growth rate, AMZN has a P/E of 455.9!)

2. USE The PEG ratio. It's used to determine a stock's value while taking the earnings growth into account. Per investopedia, The PEG ratio is used to evaluate stocks to determine whether or not the stock is under-priced. Therefore, a PEG ratio less than 1 is more desirable. Here, MU's PEG ratio is 0.65...
From a value investor's prospective, and with long term growth in mind, THAT is a huge plus.

2. MU's Price-to-Book Ratio P/B is 0.96
This means that for every 96 cents per dollar you invest, you would receive $1's worth of assets from company's books should the firm be liquidated. That's a 4.17% potential gain right there.

Please let me know what you think as I would appreciate your feedback.

*****

Trade the financial markets, specifically Forex trading. It's a fkin trillion dollar industry! There are a plethora of businesses online that sell software to meet the trading/investment needs of various demanding clients.

Just look up online EAs (Expert Advisor, which is automated/algorithmic trading, for Meta Trader 4), verify results using the myfxbook website (i.e. a reputable independent third-party website that certifies and tracks the record/performance of various trading strategies/systems, including commercial EAs), purchase the EA, verify results again by running/performing both a backtest and a forward test (i.e. paper trading on a demo account), and then, and only then can/should you use the EA with real money trading on a live/real account.

You can verify the EA's reliability by performing a backtest for a ""significant"" time period (for example 5-10 years; or depending on the ""frequency"" of trades placed from the EA) coupled with 2-3 months of forward testing (i.e. paper trading on a demo account) and if the results are ""consistently"" profitable (i.e. ""overall consistent"" ""monthly"" profits from both backtesting and forward testing) with drawdowns being not ""too much/high/extreme"" AND not ""too frequent"", then you can go live and trade using real money.

It's okay to expect a particular trading strategy/system to expire (i.e. lose its edge, or for profits to weaken/deteriorate/diminish). When that time comes, simply go onto the next “hot/trendy” EA or if you were fortunate enough to accumulate significant profits, you can store those profits in an interest-savings account and receive periodic income that way.

The purpose of backtesting and forward testing is to ensure drawdowns are not ""too much/high/extreme"" AND not ""too frequent"", AND that there is proper risk management ""embedded within the EA"", thus minimizing/avoiding the risk of ""extreme"" drawdown or ""extreme"" losses when using real money.

Note: The switch to ""another"" hot/trendy EA should be made when the profits earned from the ""current"" EA have reached a point/level where it no longer appeals to the individual's interest/preference. However, if there is an ""unusual/unexpected/unanticipated"" ""significant"" drawdown (according to the performed backtest and forward test), then that would unfortunately represent an actual/real risk/loss incurred by the individual (and would still require a switch to another hot/trendy EA). This risk can be ""mitigated/minimized"" by performing a backtest ""AND"" a forward test (both for a ""significant"" time period, i.e. depending on the ""frequency"" of trades placed from the EA), AND by conducting a proper psychological evaluation of the EA seller (as an ""individual"" entity), i.e. evaluating their reliability, logic, and confidence when it comes to addressing/answering relevant/crucial questions pertaining to Forex/Finance/Trading/Investing (rather than asking for or needing specific details regarding their intellectual property or proprietary strategy/system/software, i.e. their source code or trading methodology).

Ultimately, it comes down to “risk tolerance” while taking into account the results obtained from backtesting and forward testing, as well as the level of confidence and trust you impart/place on the person/group selling/distributing the EA.

Note: refer to the Investopedia website for definitions on the following terminology/vocabulary: backtesting, forward testing (i.e. paper trading on a demo account), drawdown (DD), maximum drawdown (MDD or MaxDD), and monthly/annual ROI (return on investment, as a percentage).

Also, note: ""focus"" on testing for maximum drawdown (MDD or MaxDD) (making sure drawdowns are not ""too much/high/extreme"" AND not ""too frequent""; for example, not greater than 30%-50%, depending on your risk tolerance or preference) and looking for a ""track-record"" of ""overall consistent"" ""monthly"" profits from both backtesting and forward testing, i.e. paper trading on a demo account (both for a ""significant"" time period, depending on the ""frequency"" of trades placed from the EA). This ""track-record"" can be ""verified"" either through the ""myfxbook"" website or through the combined use of backtesting and forward testing.

Each and every year, students graduate from college and university. How is it ""economically feasible"" to provide jobs for all or most of these people? My understanding is that people need to display a good understanding of the psychology of first impression, which includes genuine/authentic personality, trustworthiness, and competency (reflected in education); in other words, honest, reliable, and competent in relevant matters, or integrity, energy, and intelligence. 

Problem: The individual's attainment of their “desired dream/career job"", which is their ultimate purpose for pursuing ""rigorous"" higher education (i.e. college or university) or ""rigorous"" professional education (i.e. apprenticeship or trades).

I believe that a lot of people attend college and university with the hope that they will obtain a job after they graduate, a job that will support them financially. If money is the primary reason for their pursuing higher/professional education, shouldn't they be ""informed"" (as part of a global/collective civic/social responsibility) that there are alternative ways of making money (personally, namely, trading the financial markets), ones that will actually lead them to, or at least have a higher probability of leading them to, financial independence/prosperity, since the chances of them achieving such goal upon graduation from college/university is realistically slim – if not the problem of difficulty finding employment related to their “desired career/dream job”, then the problem of a dead-end mediocre job with a “fixed” “small” salary?

Should we, as a society, steer people away from college/university, often temporarily, since, let's be honest, our society is currently producing ""a lot"" of ""mediocre"" individuals with no real chance of obtaining a job that they were initially in pursuit of? Can we, as a society, do a better job of ""realizing"" and ""maximizing"" the talents/skills of these ""mediocre"" individuals, i.e. individuals who have no real chance of obtaining a job which they had been (or currently are) pursuing/studying rigorously for?

After going through a proper evaluation of current circumstances and current options, I've realized that people need to get certain things in their life straight ""before"" working on pursuing higher/professional education – i.e. Health &gt; Wealth &gt; Education/”Prestige”. 

The mass of people who pursue college and university because their program is in high demand are ones that are studying the program not for its unique intricacies, but rather only for graduation with the expectation that they ""deserve"" to be rewarded a job. As opposed to, respect and appreciation to the language their subject takes on (whether that be Accounting language or Computer Programming language, etc.). Respect and appreciation for a subject or field is displayed when the person engages with the subject or field with a “critical thinking” mindset, with the main purpose/goal of analyzing and critiquing thoroughly the accuracy of any statement presented to them that is related to their chosen subject or field, i.e. effectively utilizing journaling and documentation (see relevant section below, point #1 of 2 under “ESSENTIAL/CRUCIAL” for more details); this main purpose/goal is often rooted from a genuine desire/interest/passion for pursuing/studying their chosen subject or field.

The simple fact remains that it is simply not economically feasible to provide jobs to meet the constant influx of supply being produced by colleges and universities, ""each"" and ""every"" year. As a result, why are people making the foolish decision to incur immense amount of “DEBT” (keyword) while pursuing higher/professional education when the economic reality simply does not provide enough jobs for society, i.e. jobs that are specifically expected of from college and university graduates?

Quoted from someone else: ""Our societies have for so long told us that education can and should equate to professional success, which should equate to economic success, yet we are entering a period where that simply can't occur. The foundation that those notions were created upon doesn't exist any longer, given how we have evolved and grown as a species, and we have yet to make the transition to a new set of notions.""

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some ESSENTIAL/CRUCIAL characteristics of an individual who exhibits genuine desire/interest/passion for pursuing/studying their chosen subject/field (especially at the higher education or professional education level) are as follows:

1) Effective ""Information Management"" strategy (utilizing journaling and documentation). The individual had made it a priority to create and compile personal notes or online documents for the purpose of future-reference and documentation – for potential revision, self-reflection, self-correction, or discovery, as this is crucial for knowledge retrieval, knowledge retention, as well as knowledge synthesis and creating/generating new knowledge. Note: information becomes knowledge when you regard the information as valuable and when you make the conscious decision to keep it as part of your notes with the expectation/option of using it in the future; knowledge is information in action, so actually using the information, instead of dismissing it as irrelevant. 

--&gt;Response from another individual/writer:

* I don't mean that all information has to be kept as notes, nor that other strategies/tactics of finding/retrieving information aren't valuable. I don't even mean that it's impossible for someone to exist/operate without ever taking any notes. Most saliently, I'm more saying that to categorically omit note-taking from one's information management capabilities/strategy is to invite unnecessary trouble, likely to the point of dysfunction, unless one happens to never be doing anything that involves any significantly elusive information to begin with.

* My bias toward this assessment is reinforced by 25+ years of highly-technical work that has resulted in literally thousands (or tens-of-thousands) of pieces of information, extremely valuable to me, that can't be readily found anywhere but in my notes.

* Some of it is information specifically originating with myself – there's no one or nowhere else from which it can be gotten. Some of it is information that took me immense amounts of time, thought, and effort to find/acquire, and I would never want to have to try to find it again. Most of these things are in my notes because they have either already disappeared, or are likely to disappear, off of the internet, or don't lend themselves well to simple bookmark-able reference.

* Another way of saying this is that personally-kept notes are a reflection of the time/effort/insight one has had to put into acquiring the information, combined with the value of retrieval efficiency (organized for one's own retrieval needs). To subject yourself to relying on reproduction of that time/effort and self-organization is to either admit that the time/effort isn't significant (i.e. the information is rather trivial or ubiquitous in nature), or that your own time/effort spent isn't worth much (if you're willing to repeat it).

* Also, if one assumes that the information is always going to be right where you can easily find it, or even right where you found it before, that's actually just naive.

* While its true you still need to expend time/effort into locating the info, it has been organized specifically how YOU determine it should be, and thus truncates any actual ""overhead"" involved in the typical ""location"" process, not to mention the guarantee that it's actually there to find. Note: overhead expense refers to an ongoing expense of operating a business; it is also known as an ""operating expense"".

* As a simple/clear example: if you've never spent hours sifting through the deluge from the Google sewer pipe flooding into your browser, just to find anything remotely relevant to the fairly elusive technical scenario you're trying to resolve, then you're probably not acquainted with really anything I'm talking about, and your dismissal would then represent simply being unaware.

2) The individual is ASSERTIVE and NOT PASSIVE towards the subject they are studying. They are WILLING to articulate and share important ideas and concepts from the subject they are studying. The individual is not seen as someone who is under the spell/act (i.e. false and disingenuous impression of superior intelligence) of mindless regurgitation but rather, the individual is able to offer their OWN UNIQUE interpretation on the subject they are studying, while also citing important concepts or ideas where citation is necessary. In other words, the individual demonstrates ""individual competency"" THROUGH the subject they are studying and are ultimately/inherently passionate about. The individual's competency (i.e. his/her opinion or interpretation of what is relevant or accurate information) is demonstrated through the individual's pattern of logical and coherent thinking, as well as through the individual's writing style (which displays ""CONFIDENCE"" in what the individual is presenting as relevant or accurate information).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Relevant response from another individual:

Decide where you fall on the self-directed spectrum.

Highly self-directed: technical books and MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses)

Average: an online community + curriculum like Free Code Camp or theodinproject.com

Not very self-directed: An in-person coding boot camp like Hack Reactor or App Academy; similar to “subpar/mediocre” college/university “classroom” learning.

There are only so many ways of acquiring wealth (with only some methods actually leading to long-term/sustainable financial independence/prosperity):

1) Real Estate

2) Owning a business; being an entrepreneur

3) Career Job requiring higher education (i.e. college or university) or professional education (i.e. apprenticeship or trades) 

4) Minimum Wage Jobs

5) Trading the financial markets; making financial “investments” (stocks, forex, futures, options, equities, commodities, etc.)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pseudo-Intellectual versus Intellectual (the following is a response from another individual/writer):

An intellectual follows the values and attitudes of Critical Thinking, and exercises good thinking habits. Their interest lies in discovery and self-correction. 

The traits of a true intellectual are as follows:

* intellectual humility – recognizing the limits and sensitivities of one's experience.

* intellectual courage – ability to examine things and/or state results or potentialities, even if it may be costly/risky to your personal beliefs, or social acceptance, established norms or theories. The ability to put things at risk. Even if they are your own cherished ideas or beliefs that you are putting at risk.

* intellectual empathy – knowing that you have to imaginatively put yourself in the place of others in order to understand them.

* intellectual autonomy – being able to think independently, to carry through without constant guidance from others, and sometimes even to come to different conclusions.

* intellectual integrity – holding yourself to the same standards you hold others, and holding all beliefs to the same standards.

* intellectual honesty – being willing to admit discrepancies and avoid overlooking exceptions, even to oneself.

* intellectual perseverance – having the patience to struggle through difficult or complex problems.

* confidence in reason – willingness to follow the logic where-ever it leads.

* fair-mindedness – avoiding making unjustified special exceptions or privileges. Holding all viewpoints to the same standards. This does not mean that all views are equal; it means they all are held to the same universal standards. They might end up meeting those standards very unequally. For instance: the theory of evolution vs the fable of creation, or climate change vs science denialism.

A pseudo-intellectual does not do these things. Their interest lies not in discovery and self-correction, but in confirmation of what is already believed. Confirmation Bias. Their ""thinking"" style is characterized by cognitive biases, a lack of self-reflection/self-correction, a lack of rigor and completeness, and applying woefully different standards to beliefs/ideas that they cherish, and any information that calls them into question.

16-03-25,4by0l9,Looking for information on equity dilution,"Hello, I used the search function but could not find anything pertaining to my direct question.

I am new to this investing/financial world. I am obsessed with learning as much as I can.

There is one thing that I am having trouble finding an answer for or understanding.

I am wondering about stock/equity dilution.

When I buy a single stock in a billion dollar company, I understand that: 

- it is overall just a drop in the bucket and really does not have any impact on the majority shareholders or value of the stock/company.
- When I give GE $31 for their stock that is also 31$ in revenue (I am not sure this is the right term) but it adds 31$ to their value
- majority of the owners have X amount of shares equally an X% in the ownership of the company.

What I do not understand is how with these direct stock purchase plans that big companies have, how do the large majority owners keep their actual PERCENTAGE of the company?

Take GE for example, they have 9 billion ""shares"" outstanding (288 billion market cap, with a $31 share price) and their direct investment plan says their is a max of $40,000 investment. What is stopping a big hedge fund from getting 720,000 of their clients to do a ""max buy"" and owning over 9 billion shares in GE? that would double their equity but the ownership would be 50% with this crazy theoretical hedge fund. And they would represent the majority of voting rights. This crazy hedge fund would TAKE OVER! 

In more real terms, companies that just offer stocks to buy directly from the company, wouldn't their majority shareholders slowly have a decreased ownership in the company?

What rules are in place to prevent this?
Do companies put freezes on the direct purchase plans?

Is there a big piece of info/knowledge I am missing??  ",3

Parents just found out about a chunk of retirement savings they had somehow (?) forgotten about.  They had an FA or accountant point it out a few months ago.  They know I have some experience in investing (managed a small Scottrade account since I was 10, had about an 8% CAGR), as well as a wide range of knowledge and several years' hands-on experience in angel investing, real estate, U.S. equity investing/portfolio management, and some IG credit research.  They basically called me up and said ""Hey we're basically considering this free money.  Would you like to manage it?""

I'm tempted to, because they have assured me there is no pressure to perform incredibly well, I think I could do a pretty good job at it, and it would be even more experience than I've had to-date.  My questions are:

1. What kind of questions, ground rules, policies should I be thinking about here?  Obviously I want to get their specific goals, performance measures, risk tolerance, liquidity needs understood and on paper.  What else?
2. Is there a benefit to me setting up an LLC for this?  For liability purposes, for a very modest incentive structure (like 0.25% AUM), for proving it was legitimate if I want to talk about it to a future employer?

16-03-25,4bv39z,I want to talk about SeaWorld. Get in here to talk about SEAS,"I do not own, and have never owned, SEAS shares.


SeaWorld has recently announced that they will no longer breed orca whales, no doubt bowing to the pressure of animal rights activists. Since SeaWorld became public I have been fascinated with their stock sheets. Their greatest ""asset"", outside of maybe land property, is their livestock. Their business model is based around maintaining and entertaining with sea life, absolutely crazy that this stock is publicly traded. 

Since announcing they will no longer breed orca whales and begin phasing out their orca shows, the stock has jumped 15%. How is this even possible? They are giving up their greatest asset - setting all moral beliefs aside because of course we are greedy, selfish, money crazy investors (sarcasm). I have zero understanding as to how the outlook of SEAS is greater now that they have finally given up to Blackfish (CNN Documentary). How is the stock up? The orca show is their biggest act, and the orcas themselves the company's greatest asset. They just gave up both of those revenue streams - with absolutely no replacement for lost revenue. I honestly don't even think this is over with orca whales, I think animal rights activists will pressure them even further now that they actually won a battle. How does SEAS even make a case to stay public? They are essentially committing to be a non-profit organization saying they are going to focus on the sustainability of orca whales in the wild. There is no profit in that. ",1

You want to make money playing the oil game? Get out of those disgusting ETNs and buy some real companies. I like small cap E&amp;Ps. When oil rises they respond pretty similarly to UWTI, but you're not going to get fucked by decay.

Okay, yacht time:

**What to look for in a E&amp;P for survival?**

**1) Debt.** Debt is killer in a downturn like this one. Debt to asset ratio is pretty much meaningless because nobody is going to buy a rig from your company so you can pay down your shitty debt. Try debt to cash-on-hand to get a good gauge of the financial health of the company. (If it doesn't have cash, then I use debt to EBITDA)

EX: Seadrill

* Cash: 1,044
* Short Term Investments: 96
* Total cash and equivalents (because fuck acct receivables): 1,140

But you have:

* CPLTD: 1,489
* Long Term Debt: 9,054
* Total debt: 10,543 (That's 10 billion dollars in bloody debt, on a $1.53B market cap)

Verdict: 9.25x debt to cash on hand, aka pretty fucked.


**2) Profit/Loss per barrel.** Literally how much does it cost to take a barrel of the good stuff out of the ground. In Saudi Arabia it could be as cheap as a long straw, and for some shale producers its upwards of $70/bbl. You want to aim for producers that can break even at no more than $50/bbl.

EX: Gran Tierra Energy (Read a 10k for this info)

* Oil Produced: 6058
* Net income: (3.61)
* Loss per barrel: Negligible 
* Average sale price: $42.3

Verdict: $42.3/barrel needed to take it from the ground to the customer

I don't really care about the rest of the bullshit or what the company says it breaks even at. This is a simple, back of the napkin calculation of how good the company is at making money.

**3) Net Change in Cash.** Aka how long can this E&amp;P bleed money without needing to beg Goldman Sachs for more money to bleed.

EX: EOG Resources

* Net Change in Cash: (1,368.71)
* Cash-on-hand: 718.51

Verdict: Stop bleeding money! (They paid a ton of deferred taxes in 2015 so it's not really fair to them. Great company!)

**4) Company Specific Risks.** There is no point looking at industry risks because you're already dead set on YOLOing your life's savings on oil. Oil will go up or it will go down come monday, who the hell cares? It's not like everyone will be riding electric segways in 2017, so oil isn't going away any time soon. 

EX: Bankers Petroleum

* Major risk: Corrupt as fuck Albanian government and their tax dispute
* Minor risk: Liquidity risk, hard for a small company to raise capital


**What to look for in a E&amp;P for takeover target?**

1) Clean books and clean stock structure

2) Tons of reserves but not enough $$$ to take it out of the ground

3) Management team that's not entirely stupid

4) Strategic for the big integrated players

5) Undervalued (Don't use BV, BV is BS -- use EV/EBITDA)

--

I've been typing this for half an hour now and I'm tired. Here's my oil yolo portfolio. I'll justify each choice if this post gets some attention:

* Whitecap Resources (20%)
* Ithaca Energy (20%) (A real YOLO)
* Bankers Petroleum (10%)
* Crescent Point Energy (10%)",237

One final thought, BK works IF YOUR LIABILITIES OUTWEIGH YOUR ASSETS, this is NOT the case with SUNE.

16-03-25,4bz19l,Stock Journal Template?,"I am a new trader that wants to keep track of all my trades and important information surrounding those trades.

Does anyone have a simple but detailed stock journal template that they would like to share? I don't care about your trades, but just would like an outline of what variables you keep track of. 

Oh, and I would like to thank you in advance with this kind gesture..... Fuck you peasants. ",8
16-03-26,4c26v5,The Variability Of Trading Profit In Penny Stocks,"The variability of trading profits in penny stocks (or the financial markets as a whole for that matter) are difficult for most new traders to fully comprehend. The reason for this is pretty clear once you think about all of the potential outcomes of any trading decision that you make. For example you can make a good decision and be rewarded with a positive outcome resulting in a profit. You can also make a good decision and end up with a negative outcome which results in a loss. This is where trading defers from most other businesses because good behavior can be punished..

On the other side of the spectrum, you can make a bad decision and naturally end up with a negative outcome and therefore experience a loss. You also could make a bad decision and end up with a positive outcome experiencing a profit. Again bad decisions in trading are sometimes rewarded and this is where you can get in a lot of trouble if you don’t know what to watch out for.

What’s very important to understand is that chance plays a small part in every trade that you make and especially in the beginning of your journey to consistent profitability, you need to make sure that you don’t let these outcomes control your psychology. This is why it is so essential for you to utilize a trading plan which ultimately incorporates a great majority of the potential outcomes and issues you may face, so that you can follow a frame work for making proper trading decisions. By keeping your emotions out of the decision making process you will increase your chance of success ten fold…

Without a plan new traders may become overconfident in their abilities when for example they put on a trade with no reason and it ends up going in their favor. Maybe this happens several times in a row and then because of this a person decides they have figured out the market and therefore choose to increase their position sizes substantially. Because of this impulse decision they end up increasing their risk level and exposing themselves to the risk of ruin. Alternatively maybe a new trader lose several times in a row and decides to give up or decides to reduce their trading position. Consequently, on the next several their trades the stock ends up going in their favor and then their profit ends up only being a fraction of what it should have been.

Earning consistent profits requires having an edge. Now contrary to what most would be traders think and edge does not have to be large. Instead it just requires taking small to mid size profits, a few unexpected large winners and predetermined and manageable loses. Unfortunately for uninformed traders emotions shapes their trading decisions and this usually means a few small profitable trades and one or two huge loses which inevitably wipes them out before they have ever had a chance to develop their trading skills.

What a new trader should instead do is be completely aware of the info mentioned above so that they can avoid becoming overconfident, and at the same time protect their capital with proper money and risk management at all costs. By doing this they will greatly improve their odds of success by insuring that they stay in the game long enough to beat the learning curve.",3
16-03-26,4bz3v1,Assets all over the place - need help re-distributing wisely,"
Long time reader, first time poster here. I  feel like I've gotten to the point with my finances where all of my investments are fractured and I'd love some help trying to streamline everything. Specifically, I'm looking for some logistical tips for how you guys consolidate all of your finances - I feel like I have too many accounts, too many credit cards, etc. Would also love some advice on the individual investments themselves - am I taking too much risk? Basically, if you were dropped into my life and had all of the below assets, how would you go about handling them? Some more info about my personal situation:

* Income: $94K in NYC 
* Location: Hoboken, NJ
* Rent: $1100/month
* Utilities: $60/month (heat, electricity, internet - yay for roommates!)
* Food: $500/month
* Drinks: $400/month
* Basic Transportation: $89/month
* Uber: $200/month
* Health Insurance: $150/month

* No Car
* No CC Debt
* Just finished paying off student loans

**Distributions:**
* 10% to 401(k) + 5% employer match
* $5,500 to ROTH IRA/yr (first year last year)

**Credit Cards:**
* Amex Premier Rewards Gold ($190/yr)
* Amex EveryDay (No Fee)
* Chase Sapphire Preferred ($95/yr)
* Chase United ($95/yr - I never use this)
* Amazon Visa (No Fee)
* Macy's (they got me with the one time 20% discount)

**Assets &amp; Distributions.** This is where I could really use some help. Am I keeping too much in cash?

* Chase Savings: $10,050 (I consider this the emergency fund)
* Chase Checking: $7,085
* BofA Savings: $218
* BofA Checking: $5,085
* **Total Cash: $19K**

**Investments:**
401(k) - Wells Fargo - $13,300.  Negative 10% 1 year return
Distribution (should I consolidate all of this??):

* The Diversified Bond Index Fund $674.89 
* The International Equity Index Fund $704.60 
* The U.S. Large Cap Equity Index Fund $2,173.88 
* The U.S. Small/Mid Cap Equity Index Fund $2,723.32 
* The 2050 Retirement Fund $6,693.52


**Roth IRA** $6,000 ($5,500 contributed)
* All in 2 stocks: NRG &amp; USO

My rationale for taking the high risk in Roth is that the gains won't be taxed....so shoot for the stars. Long term I'm thinking about putting the $5,500 into a vanguard fund per year, and then investing any gains into higher risk options.

**Robinhood** - $5,743
* Stocks: TWOU, BABA, NRG

**Motif**- $4,000
* Stocks: NFLX, TSLA, TWOU

**Bitcoin** - 9BTC n ($3.7K)

Again, any help would be greatly appreciated. My primary goals are to simplify my finances, reduce the stress of thinking about so many different accounts, and of course to grow wealth.

Thanks!

16-03-26,4bzao1,Firm Restrictions,"So I work as a broker at one of the large firms. They are pretty strict about external accounts and require approval to open them or maintain them. There's a particular security I want to buy and because of a subjective policy the firm has I'm not allowed to purchase within my personal accounts at the firm. My initial thought was to get permission to open a Scottrade or Etrade account and then purchase the security. As long as I reported the account/holdings/values I figured all would be ok. I called our compliance office to check and make sure and they were very confident in telling me that they have full authority to tell me I can't buy the security; whether in internal accounts or one held externally. Through all of my licensing I never saw a single rule through FINRA/SEC that says a firm can tell me I can't buy something because of a subjective firm policy. Should I be running this up the ladder?

Now I've been hearing MSNBC prattling for months about McDonald's all day breakfast, and how apparently the McGriddle was the top seller...this is probably what triggered my craving.

Long story short, I went to five locations in Los Angeles, and NONE of them serve anything breakfasty aside from Muffins. One location had muffins and pancakes. Every location treated me like I just arrived from mars asking for breakfast after 11am.

I called my cousins in Georgia, New York, and Texas and had them check a McDonald's. SAME THING. 

What the hell is going on here. Is this stock manipulation? The stock is up in recent weeks, and like I said MSNBC babbles away about how popular their new 'ALL DAY BREAKFAST"" has been.

16-03-26,4c31xv,New to stock trading. Just trying to figure out what stocks to consider for long-term investment (buy and hold for 5-30 years),"https://imgur.com/ZAs7yki

The photo I uploaded are the groups of stocks that I'm considering investing in, using Google Financial to organize the stocks and Robinhood to buy/sell (RH has no built-in feature to organize the stocks). My current portfolio has over 60 stocks in a variety of industries, including three ETFs (VOO, VYM, VGK). All of those stocks have a dividend similar or above the ETFs. A few of them are potential high risk without even having to look at their financial reports (and one of them apparently has more long-term debt than cash and assets combined, when I did look into its finances...).

I am a college student who will be graduating sometime soon. I did not have to take out any loans for tuition, and I have a few thousand dollars to invest. I don't have the interest or the time to do the rapid buying/selling.

I have done some brief research into the companies, but not very in-depth regarding their financials. I've read that it's extremely important to do in-depth research about stocks before buying them, which is something I did not do very well given my lack of experience and time. Should I be concerned with my attempts at diversification without fully understanding the companies' financial performances?

I can upload an image of lists of the exact stocks that I am considering to buy.
......................................................................................................................

EDIT: After reading your responses, I scrapped my original plan. I decided that VOO and VYM should form about 95% of my stocks portfolio. The remaining ~5% would be 4 stocks (3 that have significant investment from Warren Buffet), Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners LP, Coca Cola, Kraft-Heniz and Wells Fargo.

I'll need to do more research on those four stocks, though I've glanced through Brookfield's financial statements. Almost all of its assets are wind turbines and hydroelectric dams in Canada, US, and Brazil, and it appears the company is in the process of building two more wind turbine farms and another hydroelectric dam. It already built two projects last year in 2015. I'll need to find where they list their total debts and assets though.

(I'm probably going to scale the VOO/VYM to 97% when I buy more stocks down the road)

On a side note, I've done a lot of research into VOO and VYM. Both are S&amp;P500 ETFs, but the VYM has a focus on higher dividends, and has a slightly higher expense ratio (0.05% vs 0.09%). VOO uses some stocks that pay low dividends, or none at all, such as Apple. Vanguard reported that the two ETFs' average returns after 5 years only had a difference of about 0.5% before taxes.

I can't seem to decide which ETF would have greater benefits 5-30 years down the road.

FB is currently extremely shorted, over 56 million shares. Once everyone sees the big boys aren't dumping this winner, people will panic to cover their shorts, including you.

http://www.moneysmartsblog.com/canadian-online-discount-stock-brokerage-comparison/

This site makes [Questrade](http://www.questrade.com/) seem like a great option for me. (I am Canadian)

The site says stuff like:

     ""Online trade commissions

    $19.00 – If household assets are less than $50,000 and less than 30 trades per quarter
    $9.95 – If household assets are greater than $50,000 or 30-149 trades per quarter
    $7.00 – If 150 trades or more per quarter""

What does per quarter mean? Quarter of a year? So a season?(summer winter autumn spring?)

I could go through my bank,(investor's Edge CIBC) but I'm pretty sure I pay less fees for long term investments with this the other option I'm considering.

Are there other options that you think I should be looking at? What disadvantages do you see with any of these?



Edit: I tried opening an account, but it's more difficult than people make it out to be. There are so many word used that I don't know the meaning to. Looking them all up is going to take a while because with each new definition come new words within it. The whole thing feels overwhelming, and I don't understand why they need my employer's information. Is my employer going to be contacted? What if I quit the next day, would I have to update my account? I'd like to sit down with someone. I'd like to make a bank appointment, but I am avoiding their broker account(CIBC Investor's Edge) so I assume they will mislead me. Also, lots of the terms I look up seem to be specific to questrade(maybe not) but it's very difficult to understand where my money is going, how long it has to be locked away/when I can withdraw all of it if I'm wanting out, or how much anything will cost once the account is made. I was going to open an ""individual RRSP"" that's one of the selections, and they have 'options' and ntalk about calls and puts. I think I will leave this for another day.

16-03-27,4c4eth,Where you guys thinking oil is going?,"I was heavily invested in Jan 2017 calls for USO, OIL, and PBR. Made over 300% on some of the USO in two weeks. Then this last week oil has been plummeting. I lost some before I got smart and ran with the profits. Was wondering if you guys think oil is gonna keep falling or continue itself up to a resistance of $50.


I just can't get a good read on it with Iran wanting to double/triple production (lower prices). Saudi's wanting the price at $40 or lower (good for Saudi's bad for American frackers). The Opec meeting on the 16th to determine production limits (higher prices).


Also, when I sold all the calls, I bought a PBR $3 put and it went up 20% in 3 days. Currently have a trailing stop on that to lock in the profits as well. Don't know if I should double up on some more of those for USO and OIL as well or if I should pick up the calls as they continue to drop.


Anyone have any ideas?",0

16-03-27,4c5dsz,Construction Loan Equity,"I have been approved and will be building a home this summer. I am interested in getting involved in investing in real estate.

My loan and draws will be more than I need to build.  This ""extra"" cash will sit in my account till I finish the build.  I can use it to pay down the total loan and reduce my mortgage, or I can keep it albeit with a higher loan amount and mortgage.  

This money could then be invested.  Am I missing something here?  It's seems feasible and could work easier than the equity line of credit.  Are there financial ramifications that I need to be aware of?

This option would involve the construction of a new factory to manufacture electric vehicles, buying back and scrapping affected diesel cars and purchasing nitrogen emissions rights. This would be a payment for thousands of tonnes of nitrogen oxide the diesel cars emitted above their allowed limits.

The amount of excess nitrogen oxide that was emitted and the sum to be paid are still to be determined.

Company sources said the only thing that was certain was: “It will be really expensive.””

My question is what is the **best** way to make that purchase?  Things that are important to me are:

* Low cost (I know some trades are done for less than $10)
* Easy (I am not interesting in investing - just buying the stock)
* Longevity (I want to be able to login and sell just as easy a few years from now if the company discontinues the fringe benefits)

I'm currently contributing 3% with employee match, along with my IRA account w/ Vanguard at $5,500 a year. I plan on saving another 20-30k this year, but I am unsure if I should bump my 401k contributions to 20-25% and pay ridiculous expense ratio, or place additional money in a Vanguard brokerage account with a much wider range of ETF / fund options.

I've read it may be better to contribute to a taxable account if I plan on staying with my existing company for more than 20+ years, and in all likelihood there's a good chance I may.

- identify the type of investor you are;
- figure out if your strategy matches who you claim to be as an investor.

I used this test multiple times for my students in class. Hopefully it can help you guys as well.

Why? Most investors do not know what they aim for. They miss strategy and have no guidance at all when things turn for the worse.

16-03-28,4ccmag,"DIS.. my take, am I wrong?","So... Feb 9 they announced 1.63EPS over estimated 1.45, and the crowd did not go wild, since then it has been a slight climb but nothing like returning it to its previous trajectory that it has been on for years.  So here's how I see it.. tell me where I am wrong.  Short answer:  Parks / Merchandise / Studio are all blowing up like crazy, however Networks is the only one anyone cares about but I think that is short sighted as I think Disney will keep revenues up even in network turmoil.

Longer version:
	
Obviously Studio will be killing it for years to come because each year they will release:  1 Star Wars movie, 3 Marvel movies, 1-2 Pixar movies, a live action disney classic or 2, and a slew of other stuff (including a new Indy) for years to come.  They are the king of the movie hill with nothing but upside.

Parks are having a field day off of the new content to use, with expansions being planned left and right.  2 new Cruise ships (to add to their current 4).  Expanding Star Wars parks in Florida/California + some lost park?  A new park in Shanghai that opens this summer.   I can’t even keep track of all the stuff they are expanding, needless to say.. parks continue to grow and make tons of money.

Merch – obviously with the growth of the size and number of parks and more content with Star Wars / Marvel, the consumer products portion will continue to grow as well.

Networks.. apparently the only one anyone cares about.  ESPN and the loss of subscribers.  Disney has branched into other forms of delivery, they own part of Hulu, have made ‘skinny ESPN’ packages to allow for a cheap lineup and still get their channels or offering them online etc etc.  Not to mention, the content delivery systems that are taking subscribers from the networks will and do offer stuff made by Disney.. like Daredevil, Jessica Jones (Luke Cage / Iron Fist to come), and all their syndicated shows that Netflix picks up, so I see them as making money off the new content delivery systems as well.

Basically, I am still a believer, while the model might be changing, I fully expect Disney will come out ahead.  Which is why I am sitting on a whole mess of stock and plan to for a good long while even though it feels like uncertain waters now.  So, why am I wrong / why should I get out now or.. am I right and should I double down considering where it's currently at.",30

16-03-28,4ccnhy,Where is the catch with high yield ETFs?,"If we take some high yield (HY) ETF based on S&amp;P 500 or any other major index, shouldn't we expect a very similar growth over long term AND have a steady income from the dividends? Sounds too simple to be true, so, where's the catch?

**Edit**: guys, sorry if my question wasn't clear enough.

* I never claimed to have found a magical way to beat the market and outsmart the smartest people (how could you misinterpret my question that hard?)
* I never asked if my gains will be *exactly the same* or even *better* than with an S&amp;P index fund. I said **similar**. What I meant was: 6% vs 7%. Or 19% vs. 20%. Or -2% vs -4%. Similar to some degree. Without further specifications.
* I understand that I get in dividends what would otherwise (probably) become growth
* I was interested in your opinion whether or not it makes sense to consider a HY ETF some kind of ""1% cash + 99% equities portfolio"" with free (one way) re-balancing. This way, the expected growth of the equities is *close* to that of the index, but shifting some of the gains into cash (i.e. getting dividends) provides a steady access to the gains *now* (as opposed to *""later""*, although later they would probably be somewhat bigger). Think of this as of a ""X bucks now, or Y bucks in a year?""-kind of dilemma.
* I also would like to know if the equities in the HY funds are really that much riskier than the average stock in the index, since the ETF's rules for including the companies are pretty demanding (""having not cut"" or even ""having increased ... for .. straight years""). Also, doesn't the fact that a company is included in a big index like S&amp;P500 alone prove that the company is not a one-day-bubble?
* What is your opinion on the correlation of HY funds with the total index? I'd expect it to be so strong that its volatility should be similar to that of the underlying index.
* Also, does the size of a HY ETF matter? If a single company in S&amp;P500 defaults, it will affect a small portion of the overall index, but if my HY ETF only holds ""10 so-and-so best"" stocks, it will destroy like 10% of the HY ETF, am I right?",28

**Quarterly Earnings (Q1)**: Comparing 2015 vs 2014. While revenue has dropped ($2,632m vs $ 2,727m), net income went up ($49m vs $20m), short term debt increased ($874 vs $666), while long term debt decreased ($6,944 vs $7,363). Ok, a weird win or fail... let's move on to annual earnings.

**Annual Earnings (pg 3)**: http://i.imgur.com/bV19a1k.png

Ok... revenue and net income was up in 2011, then dropped by 2013 and has since increased back up.

**Debt (pg 23)**: http://i.imgur.com/HfzgajL.png

**Consensus EPS vs Actual EPS:**
http://i.imgur.com/s4oVe6f.png

See, just looking at the financials I would say this is just a boring stock that will fluctuate here and there within a range of $46 to $55. But, what's nice about this one is that the EPS has always been underestimated in the past, regardless of the performance of Carnival meaning people always expected them to fair worse than they actually did.

Technicals
--
The company has a 50-day moving average of $46.90 and a 200-day moving average of $50.19. Carnival Corp has a 12 month low of $40.52 and a 12 month high of $55.77. 

My opinion
--
Yes, I was the one who said that $ICON would beat earnings  (fun fact: wanted to write this before ICON actually) so you might as well do the exact opposite of whatever I'm about to say and get rich. But, resorts, hotels etc have been doing very very well recently. Look at things like $WYNN. Cruise ships should fall in the same category and I think Carnival is and was able to do very well. Unlike $ICON, general sentiment for CCL is a buy so I think many are expecting them to beat earnings and I think that is also why Carnival has the balls to put their ER at 10am on a Wednesday while the markets are still open. They must be confident af. My prediction is they can beat the consensus EPS of $0.31. However, what I don't know is how the market will react to it. We have seen a lot of blue chips  posting amazing earnings just to see the biggest slump in weeks right after ER. So I have two ways you should play this:

1. Play the anticipation. Ride this thing up until ER. You have until Wednesday 9:55am.  If you look at chart during their last earnings (12/18/2015), the stock did go up after beating ER, but you really would have made far more money riding the anticipation up. It's all about the tease not full on nudity.

2. Buy after the positive ER, wait for the sell off and pick it up. The fundamentals are strong and it will bounce back up. and just scalp what you can. You can see something like this in stock like $GME today. ER slighly missed EPS, but the fundamentals were so strong that that shit ripped through the stratosphere.

ER being in the middle of the trading session means you don't have to commit to shit or hold any bag overnight. Of course if you do those two strategies you run at risk that you don't get the full jackpot. But you also avoid the pain. Fuck I don't have to explain this to you. You should know all of that by now. OP is saying, don't hold through ER no matter how optimistic it is.

Q/A:
--

Q: Do I have a position in this?

A: OP has a position in Carnival in the form of a humble 7 stocks at $49.23 each (I know, fml). 

Q: Why so little, are you poor? 

A: Yes, but also cause my account blew up. So fu this is all I got.

Q: What strategy will you pursue? 1, 2 or something else?

A: I will do option 1, since I already own the stock I will sell the anticipation somewhere around 3pm EST Tuesday at a humble profit. Then after that, if the stock drops despite good ER, I will buy back in at a lower point. If Option 1 fails and the stock drops before ER I will hold through ER, yolo!

Q: Can I buy this at Robinhood or Ustocktrade?

A: Tss... yes. You can even buy it off the fucking London Stock Exchange (ticker: CCL)

Q: Are there options for CCL?

A: Yes. Low volume tho and not as many choices in terms of exp dates and strike price. No weeklies.

Q: There is another Carnival ticker called CUK. Why not yolo this?

A: CUK is an ADS? To be honest not sure wtf it does. Just know that it tends to move in the same pattern as CCL except a little more dramatic. Good ER should have a  positive effect on both tickers. But, since this ER is specifically for CCL, and CUK has much lower volume I would only focus on CCL.

Q: You full of shit, that's what your flair says. Imma short you.

A: Please do! I'm happy for anyone who can make money off this info, no matter which way.

happy easter

id post in a more appropriate sub but those guys are fooking prawns so id rather ask here.

ive been investing on and off in my free time past 5 or 6 years with etrade. i have some long positions that im happy with, but i have become more and more unhappy with the platform. it lacks certain technical charts and has high options fees. ive been learning about how to trade options for the past 5 months through many of the guides mentioned here and stuff i know from my accounting background. i have been making my first calls the past few weeks and i think i want to add an OH account as a secondary and options platform.  dem fees 2 dam high.

i still like alot of etrade and think i will keep my long stocks in there. a major chunk of my portfolio is BAC. i have 420 shares 8-)

im in at around roughly 15 unfortunately and have built it over the years, but i have have expectations of a solid rebound this year.

now if i need $5000 deposit i believe to open an OH account and get the free trade deal. is this the best way to open an account with them? are there any other deals that i should be aware of? 
im only workin with &lt;25k so i am not super flexible/liquid with cash, ive dumped everything into my etrade account and only have 2k in cash atm.  now i can off the BAC shares for a 10$ fee (its 60 to transfer brokers i think) and its worth something like 5.5-6k. enough to cover my transfer and fund the account.

is this likely the best way to move some money into a second account for me? most of my other positions are between 500-1.5k so i would have to sell multiple things.  

and as a side note BAC calls out 6 months for $15 strike are super cheap and i see a rebound when the fed stops being pussies. would a solid strategy be to maybe convert some of my BAC investment into calls, retain less shares (currently $20/3mo dividends), and use the spare change to have some more long term options on things i will think will rebound. more money for other investments, ive been more active latly.  decent play or a quick way to fuck myself?

16-03-28,4c9x5l,Anyone playing the Acadia (ACAD) Advisory Committee meeting this week?,"Acadia is trying to gain FDA approval for their drug, NUPLAZID. It is a selective inverse agonist of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A (5-HT2A) receptor, with potential therapeutic uses in the treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis. It is the first compound submitted for this indication and has been granted breakthrough designation and priority review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (not that this necessarily means too much).

On Tuesday, a panel of outside experts selected by the FDA will meet to discuss Nuplazid. At the end the day-long meeting, the experts will be asked to vote, yes or no, whether Nuplazid should be approved for the treatment of psychosis in Parkinson's patients.

You can read the FDA review of Nuplazaid [here](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/PsychopharmacologicDrugsAdvisoryCommittee/UCM492452.pdf) (PDF).

EDIT: My personal opinion is that approval with a black box label (pending further pharmacovigilance) is the likely outcome for Nuplazid. I estimate this sends the short-term pps for ACAD to $30-$35. A negative vote tomorrow would be devastating for the company (the pipeline is essentially this drug for other neurological conditions with a risk of psychosis, i.e. Alzheimer's) and pps would drop to the single digits.",10

16-03-28,4ca1vl,[Question] on the historic (and maybe future) return on stocks,"Hey there,

1) I've been watching some of Martin Shkreli's finance videos to get another view on investing. While I think he is a genius in many aspects during his lessons I do not agree with one statement that he makes: He says that the stock market does not rise in the long term, inflation based there was literally 0% return in the past.

I've seen many other statistics with ~7% historic avg. return and I'm therefore kind of confused by his claim. 

2) However I have one concern about the calculation of the 7%. The calculation is always index based (mostly S&amp;P500). I feel like by the automatic change of the companies which are included in the index, it's always the most successful (highest MC) companies that are used for the calculation and therefore the result is higher. This is just my minor concern though, mostly I’m wondering about the historic return on stocks.

Thanks in advance

16-03-29,4ce570,A different $CMG than the one you are used to (a quick DD),"I want to introduce you faggots to a different $CMG. No, not the e-coli infested piece of crap on the NYSE. I'm talking about [Computer Modelling Group](http://www.cmgl.ca), listed on the TSX.

CMG is a nice, clean (aka no e-coli induced death) long stock that has really nice potential. Lets start with the business itself:

* CMG provides reservoir simulation software to large E&amp;P companies and integrated oil companies. This includes black oil, unconventional reservoir, thermal reservoir, advanced process, and production system simulations.
* They specialize in heavy oil simulations, and all the top 20 Canadian heavy oil producers use CMG software.
* Their software suite is unparalleled with few competitors, the major competition comes from the big engineering companies like Baker Hughs' JewelSuite or Schlumberger's uncreatively named simulation software. 
* CMG has a fast growing client list of 580 clients in 61 countries - most of them pay perpetuities to the company to use their software, in addition to software support.

Onto the financial statements, this is where everyone starts to become super excited:

* Year over year revenue growth over the past 3 years is 12%, and it did not slow down in 2015
* It maintains 50% operating margins and ~30% profit margins 
* Zero debt (its not a cash intensive business so it doesn't need to go into debt to grow)
* A small (but not too shitty) 3% dividend.

And onto the bad parts:

* its priced like a growth stock, which means its stupidly overpriced. At a EV/EBITDA of 17 and P/E of 29, this stock is bloody expensive
* illiquid as fuck. On a good day you'll see 60,000 shares traded of this stock
* growth is limited by the fact everyone in heavy oil is bleeding from the asshole (supposedly, 2015 had record revenues for CMG)
* a buyout is unlikely. Not only is CMG relatively expensive, it is also the big guy in the its own specialized field

My two cents:

* CMG should be fairly valued right now, with plenty of room to grow. If you faggots are willing to buy into overpriced shit like TSLA or AMZN, then a YOLO on CMG shouldn't be a stretch.
* Its got good potential for a sustained rise if we see market euphoria around oil prices


This ain't your regular biotech yolo (in fact some may not consider it a yolo) - this is yet another oil pick because that's all I know how to research.

Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 amounted to approximately 10.2%, compared to approximately 2.2% for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase is attributed to improved margins from Edible Garden and the sales generated from IVXX from the sale of its cannabis products.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 amounted to approximately $9.83 million, a decrease of approximately 46.4% compared to approximately $18.34 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.
The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately $9.23 million or ($0.04) per share compared to a loss of approximately $21.89 million or ($0.13) per share for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of approximately $12.66 million. 

The improvement in net loss is primarily attributable to an increase in revenue, a decrease in cost of goods sold, and a decrease in expenses.

Stockholders' equity for the year ended December 31, 2015 amounted to approximately $6.34 million, an increase of approximately $5.06 million compared to approximately $1.28 million as of December 31, 2014.

Debt as of December 31, 2015 amounted to approximately $917,000, a decrease of approximately $3.7 million compared to approximately $4.62 million as of December 31, 2014.
Operational Highlights for Full Year 2015

Edible Garden Updates:

Increased number of Edible Garden retailers from 1,200 on December 31, 2014 to 1,800 on December 31 2015;
Received a Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) certification for Edible Garden's flagship New Jersey hydroponic farm;
Completed Edible Garden's new greenhouse facility with high-tech Dutch movable table hydroponic equipment, leading to improved margins at Edible Garden;
Awarded a cash grant of $300,000 from New Jersey's Clean Energy Pay for Performance Program;

Cannabis Segment Updates:

Introduced IVXX, the Company's proprietary brand of premium cannabis products, to 60 medical cannabis collectives located in Orange and San Bernardino Counties, California, as well as seven additional medical cannabis collectives located in and around Los Angeles, North Hollywood, Studio City and Sacramento, California, making Terra Tech one of the largest medical cannabis suppliers within the state.

Signed an exclusive agreement with a large distributor based in Southern California that specializes in the placement of medical cannabis infused products and concentrates, expanding IVXX's distribution reach.

Received approvals from the State of Nevada for four dispensary provisional certificates, two cultivation provisional certificates and two production provisional certificates spanning both Northern and Southern Nevada.

Subsequent event: on January 12, 2016, Terra Tech Corp. announced a definitive merger agreement under which Terra Tech will acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of Black Oak Gallery, DBA: Blum Oakland, an established retail medical cannabis dispensary in Oakland, CA.


Miscellaneous Operational Updates:
Strengthened its corporate governance program through the establishment of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Governance and Nominating Committee.
""After a year of progress in the cannabis industry, including the implementation of California's Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act, we entered 2016 with continued optimism about what the future holds for Terra Tech,"" commented Derek Peterson, CEO of Terra Tech Corp. ""During 2015 we took a number of important steps to position the Company for growth as the industry continues to reduce barriers to the supply of medical cannabis. In particular, we launched IVXX, our proprietary medical cannabis brand, which positions Terra Tech as a leading provider of high quality cannabis products and propelled us to the forefront of innovation in the industry. The launch of IVXX is particularly exciting for the Company given the rate of growth that we are seeing in the medical cannabis markets and the rapidly evolving regulatory landscape, which is becoming increasingly friendly to patients looking to alleviate their symptoms with responsible use of medical cannabis products. Although we are in the early days of marketing IVXX products, we are encouraged by the traction generated to date and are pleased to report that IVXX-branded products are now being sold in approximately 200 dispensaries across California and Nevada.""

""We also recently announced the pending acquisition of Blum Oakland, a medical cannabis dispensary in California, which will expand our reach into retail. Now that we touch every phase in the cannabis life cycle we are confident that we have a strong platform to rapidly expand our commercialization efforts and establish the IVXX brand as a market leader. As part of our strategy to expand our retail presence, in 2015 we secured eight permits to open Blum cannabis dispensaries in Nevada, the first of which is due to open next month. By expanding into Nevada we are opening up our total addressable market significantly as Nevada is the only state to recognize the patient-status of non-residents.""

""Edible Garden also saw improved results and its organic products are now sold in 1800 retailers across 18 states. We worked to expand our selection of organic produce during the year and to gain recognition as providers of high quality produce. We have been granted the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) certification, among other certifications, as evidence of the quality of our products. Our initiatives to grow the Edible Garden business led to a 30% increase in sales in this segment, year over year.""

""We intend to continue reinvesting in our business throughout 2016 to build out our retail presence and expand our proprietary line of cannabis products. We ended the year on with a strong financial position as revenues grew 41% year over year, driven by successes in both our Edible Garden and Cannabis Products segments. SG&amp;A fell significantly compared to 2014 as we streamlined costs and improved efficiencies. Furthermore, our short-term debt fell significantly, from approximately $4.6 million at the end of 2014 to $917,000 on December 31, 2015. We are greatly encouraged by the achievements of 2015 which we believe provide a solid foundation from which to fuel future growth,"" concluded Mr. Peterson.

2016 Guidance

Revenue guidance for the full year 2016 is $20 - $22 million. The predicted increase in year-over-year revenue is expected to be driven largely by sales from the Company's pending acquisition, Blum Oakland, an established retail medical cannabis dispensary in Oakland, CA, as well as continued growth of the IVXX brand throughout the California and Nevada markets.",17

16-03-28,4cbd7q,"Guys, I have a plan for the ultimate Yolo.","(shameless plug) I recently made a post on seeking alpha about a covered call ETF. If you don't understand what that is check it out here:

But while that post was more intended for reasonable investors I have come up with an idea that can appeal to those of us who are a little more retarded. 

**The Ultimate Yolo**

1. First I need one of you to help me find a broker that lets you trade options on weird derivatives. Like 3x etns etc. My current broker doesn't let you do this 

2. Get a personal loan from SOFI for 50,000 dollars, add that to my own savings for a total of 100,000 dollars. Invest this 100,000 dollars into the covered call ETF: QYLD.

3. Use Margin to double my position from $100,000 to $200,000. Now I am collecting 18% (9% x2 ) per year in monthly dividends. 

4. **Sell** even more covered call options on the covered call ETF for another 18,000 dollars per year. This is virtually guaranteed money because the covered call ETF doesn't grow . 

5. Collect 36,000 dollars per year and reinvest it into more shares of the ETF. 

6. After 10 years of compounding interest this bad boy would be worth over $7,899,815. And that is assuming I don't reinvest the dividends with margin (which I would). Remember that $7,899,815 is cash. If I used margin on that sum (and I would) It has a purchasing power of 2x or $15,799,630 Giving me over $200,000 per month. 

It isn't only the covered call ETF that lets you do these massive leverage plays. 2x ETNs with yields over 15% like CEFL, MORL, BDCL etc, offer similar opportunities. In fact the yields on some of these are so high that you can get over 40% with margin without the need to sell options.  KCAP (a non leveraged BDC) yields 18% (with a sub 100% payout ratio) and actually has an options chain with my broker.

16-03-29,4chtb1,High yield bonds as value investment,"GMO has a new article (*Giving a little credit to high yield*) on high yield: 

[http://www.gmo.com/docs/default-source/public-commentary/gmo-quarterly-letter.pdf](https://www.gmo.com/docs/default-source/public-commentary/gmo-quarterly-letter.pdf)

The summary:

*At current spreads, high yield seems to be no worse than fair value and probably better than that, even if we assume (as we do) that we are entering a fourth default cycle. In today’s environment, that makes it one of the best available risk assets for investors. But the nature of the high yield market suggests it is a good candidate for overshooting fair value to the downside whenever defaults begin to rise in earnest. Our response for BFAS at current levels is to continue to search for credit securities offering a superior combination of expected returns and downside protection while augmenting this at the margin with more index-like credit exposure. This has been a slow process, but we have been able to steadily add to our credit exposure over the last 12 months or so and we expect to continue to build our holdings over the coming months.*

*It would be lovely to claim we will be able to time the bottom for credit precisely. We will not, and unlike with equities, even if we did know the timing perfectly, getting material exposure to the asset class quickly would be extremely difficult. This leaves us with the hunch we are probably getting in a little early, the fear that we might not get all the exposure we would like before spreads move to less attractive levels, and the sure knowledge we won’t get the bragging rights of having called the turn. In other words, it seems to be an utterly classic value investing opportunity.*

 - It is in the lower part of its 52 week range.  REITs are not typically known for growth, but I feel that there is potential.  
 - The Beta is 1.63.
 - Dividend rate is 0.48 cents per share, or a 8.28% yield.
 - P/E ratio is 3.01, and EPS is 1.92
 - Currently trading at 5.78 per share.

My question is what happens to people that, say, buy the stock before April 7th, but after yesterday, the 28th?

I don't have a lot of money often, but I'd like to start investing in something that can offer some return 20 to 30 years down the line.

I'm trying to avoid any fee's or minimums as I'd like to go keep funding at my pace.

16-03-29,4chyib,Buying UA before Class C shares Released?,"Hello!


For those of you unaware, on April 7th UA is releasing a new, non-voting share class (similar to a 2 for 1 split) where shareholders as of Mar 28th will get one Class C share for every share they have.

My question is what happens to people that, say, buy the stock before April 7th, but after yesterday, the 28th? Like, if I bought X number of shares tomorrow, would I have X shares but at half the price on the 7th (thereby losing 50%)? Or would you still get the 2 for 1 shares? I am just curious - not looking at buying it right now.

Or is the stock price not going to change at all and you will have full price Class A shares but just no Class C ones?

[Have a look at this chart.](http://imgur.com/6Z6Cyym)

The horizontal rainbow lines are fib levels from the high before the New Years' Crash to the bottom of that correction (yes, super gay). The red trend line on the right is my bullish assumption if SPY bounces off our current level (it did). Below you have MACD, MFI (volume + RSI), and Universal Oscillator (signal filtered oscillator). 

So the key thing is that when the MFI and UO diverge, you're likely to see a trend change. Our prior trend was flat-towards-down, and Yellen just fucked that right in the pussy by implying she won't do the market dirty (raise rates) if market fundamentals go south. 

I have a good feeling that SPY hits 208 before it considers going back down. Trade accordingly, and remember, I could very well be wrong and can go fuck myself.",32

1) Where do you think fixed income, as an asset class, is headed in the next 10 years? Given the monster ""rally"", much higher annual returns than the average annual return fixed income has ever experienced, from 1980 to today, should fixed income be more than 20% (for stability's stake and to optimize the level of portfolio volatility) of any portfolio with an expected 1st withdrawal 10 years from now or more?

2) Should fixed income, given the information above, be only limited to short term (below 5 years) US government paper?

I'm currently looking at this bond: http://www.oslobors.no/ob_eng/markedsaktivitet/#/details/MORG29.OSE/data

The bond is listed with a coupon rate of 11,70NOK, and with the bond closing at 123,63 that should equal a return of 9,46% annually, correct?

This seems insane to me, and I'm assuming that I'm reading this wrong.

Also the bond extends to year 3999 which means a 500,000NOK investment would yield like a gazillion million moneys.

I'm probably being stupid and reading this wrong. Please let me know how.

Also, fuck you.

Edit: I just realized this yields a fixed coupon rate of 11,7% on the initial investment (right?), so there's no accumulative/compound interest type of effect in play here. investing 500,000NOK should then yield a yearly rate of 58500, which after 10 years would adjust for a NPV of 573,248.03NOK given a 2,5% inflation rate.

What does this term really mean? However more importantly how is this ""priced in"" factor determined. Ex. How do we know market has priced in a 51% chance of an October rate hike, etc...Just by looking at future contracts?

The term when taken by its face value makes sense. If the market is pricing in a 80% chance for an announcement during and event, and the announcement takes place, the market will move to accommodate the other 20%. On the other hand if the announcement does not happen, the market will react the other way.

16-03-29,4cf2mr,International index funds - do you feel that the inclusion of a large number of different countries with opposite stock performances is negatively impacting returns?,"I've had some international index funds in my retirement savings accounts since I started saving - 7 years or so. While my domestic stocks have done pretty well, the international stocks are relatively unchanged after 7 years. I was looking at the country by country breakdown of the fund (the funds in my roth and 401k are pretty wide - they include just about every country) and I was wondering if any of you think that the inability for an investor to ""internally"" re-balance with respect to  country stock weighting hampers returns. In other words, when the Euro stocks are way up, the Chinese stocks are way down, and when the Chinese are up, the Euro stocks are back down. Then there's the sometimes inverse relationship between emerging and developed countries. Within my portfolio, I'm able to rebalance between under and overperforming funds, but I obviously can't do that within a fund with different countries. 

After seven years of saving in these international funds, I feel like I have only a little more than what I started with, and I feel like its because different countries/regions are cancelling out the performance of others.

Deshpande said the rally had been driven by both institutional and retail investors and that ""we are still seeing increased positions week on week and that seems to still support oil prices.""
Technical analysts were bearish about the outlook for oil, with Barclays analysts also issuing a note on Monday warning that ""investor liquidation of long positions being built up in recent weeks"" had the potential to cause oil prices to drop 20-20 percent, meaning oil prices could fall to the low $30s.

I've been building some data analysis tools and produced this table as an exercise. The table represents the number of days per month where a given stock trading above $10, gained more than 10% at some point in the day. I limited this post to the top 20 stocks. So for example in Jan 2015, there were 8 days where CBMG gained more than 10%. The $10 part is an arbitrary share minimum that I picked to prevent the list from being polluted by penny stocks with radical gains percentages.

&amp;nbsp;

By simply glancing at the list you can immediately see that pharma/bio/therapy stocks make up almost all of the list. Why is this industry so prone to volatility?

16-03-30,4cm21i,KBR and Haliburton may be involved in another FCPA case.,"So, you guys remember in 2009 when KBR got nailed in that Nigerian bribery scandal?   Turns out that directly after their plea deal settled they may have started another round of bribery with Kazhakastan.  The news just came out this morning from a HuffPo article.  

A few points to take from this (if it's true).  First, this will still effect Haliburton because the alleged bribery was taking place during the time they still owned KBR (iirc).  Second, as part of their plea deal they basically got put on ""double secret probation"".  If they got hit with another bribery deal the punishment would escalate dramatically.  The allegations currently suggest that this round of bribery was happening while the plea deal was actually being put together, which is even worse.  From my (limited/IANAL) reading of the plea deal this could completely void that deal.   

The last round of fines came in around 600 million or so.  If guilty it is possible it could be the same or higher.  This represents almost 25% of KBRs market cap.   Of course they would share the pain with Haliburton as well, and this is a more absorbable hot for them.  But both companies are oilfield services firms that are already getting hammered hard by the downturn in the oil market. 

Should be an interesting year.

Also, here's the article I got the info from (it's part of a much larger series):

16-03-30,4cjl4b,Help understanding USDINR exchange rates,"I realize this is a US focused sub, but hopefully someone who is experienced in this area can enlighten me. 

I want to start trading in currency derivatives on the NSE (India's National Stock Exchange). To that end I'd like to get a sound understanding of the factors influencing the exchange rates (US Dollar and the Indian Rupee). So far I'm trying to follow the economic indicator news on places like *investing.com* or *tradingeconomics*, but the way USD relates to INR as opposed to the way it reacts to other major currencies like CAD, JPY, GBP completely befuddles me.


For example:
last month, some non-voting FOMC members came out and said stuff which went against the statement released earlier. Why does this impact the currencies so strongly when these guys didn't have a vote?


Towards the end of last month, I observed USD gaining on INR but losing against other major currencies. Why was this?

Even right now, after the chairperson said she'll stick to the course laid out in the earlier FOMC statement, USDINR is going up rather than down, as seen [here](http://imgur.com/Afitawn)

I realize some of my doubts could be because of momentary observations which went the other way when I wasn't looking or maybe I'm just looking at the data wrong. 

Any insight in this subject, or even text/literature recommendations would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks.

Would the difference (the money I gained) between my new account value (as a result of the sell-off) and the amount of money I pumped into the stock be classified as “unsettled funds,” or would my entire account become classified as “unsettled funds,” including the $25,000 portion I put into the account myself, not just the money I gained from the sell-off, because I pumped my entire account into that one stock?

**In other words, do I have this right?** Can I continue trading the same day using the $25,000 (original account value) I started off with that day to buy and sell more stocks the same day, I just cannot use the unsettled funds I gain from selling those stocks to buy then sell other stocks until the T+3 time frame has passed?

**If you need further clarity as to what I am asking,** if I invest all of the account money that is not classified as ""unsettled funds"" at the start of the day into a single stock and I sell it the same day, will all of the funds in my account be classified as unsettled funds, or just the money that I made from the sell-off allowing me to continue using the money I started off with that day to buy and sell more stocks that same day?

16-03-30,4cjsfb,Trading volume and commissions?,"Hello,

I'm a beginner trader and something that's really bothering me is the fees. On one hand I read that you should not risk more than 1-2% of your total account's value on a trade and in addition to that, you should split the trade. But on the other hand, the cheapest non-US brokerage charge you a $5 fee (so a total of $10 per trade).

So basically people are paying about %1 of the trade to fees on average trades? Let's say you're looking to invest $5,000 and split it to 5, %1 would be lost to fees.

How would a beginner trader go about start trading without losing at least 1% of the trade's volume to fees? Is there something I'm missing here?

-""Please be aware that certain trading activity could result in your account being classified as a Pattern Day Trading account. There are two important points to understand with regard to pattern day trading:
How you might become labeled a PDT
What it means to be labeled a PDT
 
Your account will be labeled PDT if you execute 4 (or more) round-trip day trades within 5 business days provided the number of day trades is more than 6% of your total trades in that account for that same five-day period. You need only meet this criteria one time  to become designated a PDT.
 
Once your account is labeled PDT, you are subject to different requirements and restrictions than a non-pattern day trader. The most significant of these requirements is that your account must maintain at least $25,000 worth of equity.
If you do not meet this minimum, you will receive a margin call to meet the minimum equity requirement, which you must meet within 5 business days. Otherwise, the account's day trading buying power will be frozen for 90 days or until the margin call is met.""-

 I believe this means that I can buy and sell the same stock (roundtrip) 3 times a week and not be labeled a PDT. I know this post sounds dumb but I just want to make sure that I do not get this label.

16-03-30,4ck0l5,How do people manage to predict the market using candlesticks?,"I've been reading couple of articles lately about candlesticks analysis. Hammers, falling stars, all this sounds logical until I try to get how they are used for predicting future moves. For example, some articles claim that a hammer after a downtrend signals about a potential earning surprise. But from what I see in different charts, this is true for like half of the time, 50/50. Others say I should combine candlesticks with other signals, like oscillators, but this also doesn't seem solid to me.

16-03-30,4cmnm2,Thoughts on CMG,"So CMG got hit pretty hard and then the usual bounce... but going into summer, I'm thinking that the combination of:
1) lower SSS and higher expenses (food DNA testing etc) 
2) running lower on funds via the massive stock buyback that's almost over, and may end up underwater
3) loss of customer confidence (stores in multiple states getting hit with norovirus/e-coli even though food is supposed to be 'locally sourced', nobody still knows the cause, etc)
4) SSS numbers had decelerated a good chunk BEFORE the ecoli thing.
and 5) mutual funds won't be happy to have this on their books with Q1 losses when the overall market is doing better and there are other fish in the sea
..all make for a pretty grim picture of things.  Looking at how all this info sinks into the market mind going into summer, it's going to take a big positive surprise to not hit lows. 

This is all very bearish of course, and there is always another side to things.  I'm curious to know sentiment on bull case right now.  I'm generally bullish at CMG's long term prospects, but few players are truly long term in the markets anymore.  ",2

Pfizer has announced that it will merge with Allergan in a reverse buyout all stock transaction.

At the buyout, Pfizer holders will receive one share of the new Pfizer company and Allergan holders will receive 11.3 shares.

The new Pfizer will have its tax home in Ireland thus gain a significantly lower corporate tax burden.

The buyout will also create significant savings through combining the two companies.

This article presents a couple of options for investors to profit from the buyout.

My biggest question is: What will the process be for the conversion of one's AGN stock into 11.3 worth of PFE shares? Will my online stock broker do this automatically once the merger is finalized?

16-03-29,4cgdrn,A Case for Citigroup (C),"I have been looking at getting into a megacap financial services company for a few months now and am very intrigued by Citigroup. This company is cheapest among its closest competitors (BAC, JPM) based on forward P/E and has been beat up of late due to a balance sheet full of energy loans and European exposure. While we can agree that oil is not going to bounce back to $100 a barrel, I do not believe OPEC can afford to keep up the current price for crude for an extended period of time. Even if prices stay low, the most recent reports have stated that Citigroup is working towards limiting their exposure in energy. With regard to Europe, your guess is as good as mine. But with these risks considered, C still posted ~$17 bil net earnings in 2015, making it their best year in almost a decade. 

With that said, haven't many if not all of the blemishes on Citigroup's balance sheet been priced into this stock? Is C a good long term play with an entry point around $41?",7

16-03-30,4ckau0,Time to buy $VXX again?,"Alright fuckers, here's my first WSB contribution. Trying to start an actual convo instead of a shit post about SUNE or some other cancer.

We've had a rally, Yellen stroked the market yesterday with her dovish talk. She was dovish b/c the economy is doing so shit. So, bad economy = no higher interest rates = yay buy stocks. Somehow, a bad economy != sell off. 

DJIA has gone from 15,800 to 17,600 the last 4-6 weeks. The question is, has the market topped? Well, 10-day RSI for the the S&amp;P 500 has been between 60-65 the entire month of March. As RSI above 50 indicates an overbought market. The Fed Speak is done, so now some rationality can return to the market for a bit. I keep seeing people cry about losing money on Faggot's Delight SPY puts and ask ""OMG y r the market keep going up??"" 

Well, I think it's overbought and it's time for a correction. $VXX is currently around $17.50 pre-market. I'm going to get in today, average down over the next couple of days if it keeps going down, and enjoy my gains if the market dips again. I'm seeing an easy gain of 15-20% (buy @ 17.50ish, sell at $20 to 21) or higher if you've got some balls and think there's gonna be a bigger correction. Back in September and January VXX went from around $16-17 up to $30, so there's potential for 60-70% gainz if we see a substantial correction.

You could probably make more with SPY puts, but VXX is so low right now anyways you can just hold it for a bit and won't lose all your money on expiring contracts.

Thoughts? Comments? Lube recommendations for fucking myself?

I believe it is important to have a big picture to give context to what is going on in the market and I am interested in your take, here's a short summary of mine.

For me, employment seems to be on the rise, parts of the economy show signs of growth, rates are still low providing liquidity and suppressing an overly strong dollar (helping earnings of international companies)

With a few of these positives &amp; others I believe the US economy is close to entering a full fledged growth period with a full fledged bull market.  However, I fear one more market-wide correction before this happens, with multi-year S&amp;P 500 &amp; DJI plateauing.

However, I am wondering if there are any obvious catalysts?  A fresh drop in oil prices?  Continued QE &amp; loosening in EU/Asia?  A lackluster earnings season?

&gt;&gt; For example, let’s say you purchased a bond for $1,000 with an 8 percent coupon (it pays $80 annually per $1,000 of face value). If interest rates drop below 8 percent, the bond is worth more than $1,000 because investors will pay more to receive the higher interest payments. On the other hand, if interest rates rise, your bond will be worth less than $1,000 because it is less attractive to buyers, who won’t pay face value for a bond that pays less than the current interest rate.

If the interest rates increase, wouldn't I get more return on my bond? ",5

16-03-31,4craeq,$MLBY Hype/Shitpost,"You have two hours to hop on the Mobileye train. It just hit a reversal. Buy under $37 now.

Mobileye builds camera-based Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. Their full hardware and software package can cost less than $1,000. Tesla and GM are both customers. Autonomous driving technology will play an increasing role in all cars manufactured over the next 15+ years. Growth will be astronomical. http://www.cmlviz.com/cmld3b/images/selfdriving.png

That said. Level 4 (completely autonomous driving) is still decades away. Getting 99% there is easy, getting 99.99999% there is incredibly fucking difficult. Even the most advanced cameras and AI can't deal with terrible weather and other edge cases. One possible solution is installing magnets/sensors along major roadways which is a massive public works undertaking that won't happen overnight. So for now we are stuck with cameras.

A few weeks ago Musk paid Mobileye a visit. He was three weeks away from one of the biggest consumer product launches in history (that's tonight at 8:30pm PT. tune in). It's my completely uneducated and technically unsound purely speculative opinion that the Model 3 will offer (as an optional $1,000+ addon) Level 3 limited self-driving automation - and $MBLY tech will play a crucial role. 

This may be the ""part 2"" of the Model 3 announcement that Elon alluded to on Twitter. Tonight I am predicting - based on absolutely no technical analysis, under one year of trading experience, and under one hour of research - an explicit or implicit shout-out to $MBLY that pops the company to fucking Mars.

Let's say MBLY gets no love by name. That's still fine. I can't imagine a Model 3 announcement that doesn't include at least a passing reference to the inevitable autonomous car future. Whatever it is, that pull quote will be plastered in major newspapers across the globe and revitalize interest instantly in ADAS and its proxies. Rising tide lifts all boats.

Killing its own jobs, to be specific. 

&gt;BlackRock has been tremendously successful with its empire of exchange-traded funds. That may be great news for its business, but perhaps not so much for its workforce.


&gt;BlackRock, which is credited with the first fixed-income ETF, has clearly been a leader in this realm, with almost $1.1 trillion under management in its iShares business, up from $914.4 billion in 2013. ETFs were BlackRock’s top asset gatherer globally last year, according to the firm’s annual financial statement filed last month.

&gt;But BlackRock’s success may also lead it to rely less on people in relation to its assets. The firm, which has more than $4 trillion under management, is planning to cut about 400 of its employees in what may be its largest round of cuts ever, Bloomberg News reporters Sabrina Willmer and Kiel Porter wrote in an article on Wednesday. While the layoffs aren’t monumental, equal to about 3 percent of the firm’s staff, and don't preclude hiring in certain areas later in the year, they mark a slowdown from BlackRock’s rapid growth over the past decade.

&gt;[the ETFs themselves] are tremendously popular among individuals as well as hedge funds and other institutions. They attracted $347 billion of new money last year, breaking the previous year’s record.

&gt;But here’s the catch from a profitability standpoint: They generally track indexes and usually don’t require much (or any) specific security analysis. They also carry lower fees than average actively managed funds. These two factors together add up to lower demand for people and less money relative to assets to pay them.

&gt;The lower cost is attractive to investors who have witnessed active funds post disappointing returns relative to their benchmark indexes

&gt;The low fees are getting even lower as the biggest fund managers battle for market share. This price war prompted BlackRock to cut fees on seven funds last year.

&gt;BlackRock shook up the asset-management world with ETFs and will most likely continue to dominate the field. It just will need fewer people to keep its colossus moving forward.",1

16-03-30,4cl82b,Long $CTRV ContraVir Pharma @**$1.24** - Advice on trading equity issues,"Just went long **$CTRV** after they announced an equity issue of stock and warrants, for a dilution of **%18.5** from the stock issue and combined **%27** including the warrants.

What's interesting is that the equity issue was announced at **$1.48**, a discount to where the stock closed at **$1.68** yesterday, but now a massive premium to the current price of **$1.26**. 

So my question is what happens when a stock plunges below the price of an announced equity issue? Do they drop the price of the equity issue or cancel it? 

The warrants can be exercised at **$1.70**, so they way i see it, they're not really that bad of a dilution as if the stock goes above $1.70 and they become in the money and dilute, I've made enough profit anyway.

This is the a stock that went up ~70% yesterday on the back of good results of a Hep B trial, and i thought that this drop is unjustified, especially considering that the equity issue gives them more cash on the balance sheet to put to work.

Anyone have experience trading in stocks that announced equity issues? Any thoughts on how to play this? I see this as an overreaction that could be reversed in due course.

Questions:
-What does this reverse stock split really mean? 
-Why would they do it if the value of the company doesn't really change? 
-Was my original investment a good trade? 

My assumption is that this is a good thing for the company because it allows them to stay publicly traded and possibly give the company more exposure.

16-03-30,4clei7,A Guide To Shorting Leveraged ETFs,"This post documents some of my research in creating a trading strategy centered around shorting leveraged exchange-traded funds (ETFs). I present the following thought experiment to motivate readers:

* Suppose an underlying instrument increases by 25% on day 1 and decreases by 20% on day 2. The return of the underlying instrument is (1 + 0.25) * (1 – 0.20) – 1 = 0%.

* Now suppose I construct a leveraged ETF designed to track 3x the daily return of the underlying instrument. The return of the leveraged ETF is (1 + 0.75) * (1 – 0.60) – 1 = -30%. 

The intuition here is that in flat but volatile markets, leveraged ETFs exhibit price decay due to the effect that volatility has on cumulative returns.

16-03-31,4co00s,Great Basin Announces Effectiveness of Reverse Stock Split of Common Stock," Great Basin Scientific, Inc. (NASDAQ:GBSN), a molecular diagnostics company, announced today that it has effected a 1-for-35 reverse split of its common stock. The Company has issued no additional shares since announcing its intent to effect the reverse split, and therefore its common stock will open for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on Thursday, March 31, 2016 on a post-split basis, with 3.265 million shares outstanding. The common stock will have a par value of $0.0001.

Proportional adjustments have also been made to the Company's outstanding preferred shares, senior secured convertible notes, stock options, warrants, and equity incentive plan. The number of authorized shares of the Company's common stock remains unchanged.

“Great Basin faced two challenges in maintaining its continuing listing on Nasdaq; this reverse split resolves the first of those challenges by allowing us to meet the minimum bid price requirement,” said Ryan Ashton, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Great Basin Scientific. “We want to assure shareholders that we are committed to doing all we can to bring the Company back into compliance with the Market Value of Listed Securities (MVLS) requirement outlined in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b). While the Nasdaq staff cannot grant an additional 180 days for Great Basin to come into compliance with the MVLS requirement, the Company can and will request a hearing, which will stay our delisting. At that hearing we intend to present a plan for coming into compliance, and the Hearing Panel has the discretion to grant us up to an additional 180 days from the date of the relevant delisting letter to regain compliance. To that end, we are working with our institutional shareholders to reduce the derivative liability caused by certain of our outstanding securities, and we are working closely with our financial advisors, including our Nasdaq consultant, to prepare a complete plan for coming into continued-listing compliance that we will present to Nasdaq at the appropriate time.”

About Great Basin Scientific

Great Basin Scientific is a molecular diagnostics company that commercializes breakthrough chip-based technologies. The Company is dedicated to the development of simple, yet powerful, sample-to-result technology and products that provide fast, multiple-pathogen diagnoses of infectious diseases. The Company's vision is to make molecular diagnostic testing so simple and cost-effective that every patient will be tested for every serious infection, reducing misdiagnoses and significantly limiting the spread of infectious disease.

16-03-31,4crzrd,$AAPL ER play,"Thought I'd give a heads up for a possible upcoming (2-3 week hold time) ER play opportunity. 

AAPL ER 25th April after market close. 

**DD:** I checked back to Jan 2014 and they to beat EPS on all of their past ERs, but not always on revenue. 

In 2015 the stock consistently ran up prior to the ER date. Not always a 2-3 week run up, but significant gains approximately a week before the ER. It didn't in Jan though. I think that was probably because of market conditions at the time. With rate hikes now not likely in April, I feel like AAPL could run up prior to their ER again. Also, IV has begun its climb. 

**Play:** Considering 06May16 calls to ride the ER hype.

EDIT: I WOULD NOT recommend that people hold their call contracts through the ER since AAPL's x-div dates are usually 1 - 1.5 weeks after their ER dates. Because of this I'm considering the 29Apr06 calls rather than the 06May16 ones.",22

16-03-31,4cs0ex,Biotechs with serotonin-receptor antagonists,"So you want to YOLO biotechs that make Serotonin (5-HT) receptor antagonists. Why would you want to do that? Because the Acadia pharma hype train chugga-chugged this stock from less than $20 to $28 in less than a month before the [FDA panel, which turned out favorably for the company.](http://ir.acadia-pharm.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=125180&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=2151571)

Acadia makes 5HT2A receptor antagonists to combat Parkinson's disease psychosis. It's essentially the opposite of hallucinogens, which are 5-HT2A agonists. 

The kicker is the serotonin receptor antagonists have applications in depression too. While any medication that inhibits 5-HT2A receptors will treat Parkinson's psychosis, there's a whole cohort of 5-HT receptor varieties with different responses to agonists and antagonists. While the status quo of using SSRI's makes it seem counterintuitive to treat depression with a 5-HT receptor antagonist, SSRI's actually reduce 5-HT receptor expression in the long term, and this is why SSRI's take a while to work. Some of these 5-HT antagonists also work as SSRI's as they also block the 5-HTT (serotonin reuptake channel), which adds an interesting dimension and I'm still trying to understand what the implications will be. 

Companies with stuff in the pipeline on 5-HT antagonists for Parkinson's psychosis, depression, bipolar, schizophrenia, and the like are:

16-03-30,4clswd,My first trade,"It was the second semester of 8th grade,2009.It was the second day of school,my history teacher showed us this video called ""The Crisis of Credit Visualized"".I didn't know jack shit about stocks or any kind of financial derivatives.I had always heard about stocks from my father but it never really connected to me but that video gave me an idea.All i knew was that the stock prices were going to shit and i had a hunch that the decay didn't justify the low prices for some really good stocks.I wanted to invest but didn't know where to commit until i discovered Chipotle.

I went to a Chipotle store once and it was quite a distance from my house and it was during a field trip in middleschool. Six months later when i tried going back we found three new locations had opened up.A 35 minute trip was condensed into 5 minutes.I was a fan of Chipotle when people barely knew what it was and i had reasoned that the rapid introduction of new stores was a good sign.Another thing i liked about Chipotle was the simplicity of it's menu,Few products with many different combos.I liked it so much that i took all the money i know i had (From piggy bank's to robbing my mom's purse)bought 14 shares of Chipotle in February back in 09' through one of my friends father who was a trader.

It roughly came to 700 bucks(The 250 from the amount came from him for free).I sat on it and forgot about it,literally.From then on through high school i would dab in other small companies and had a grasp of how financial securities and i would daytrade hear and there. Last year January i get a call from my friends dad.He tells me to go to his place and asked for my permission to sell the stocks i had.He tells me the 700 i had turned into $9856,each share at 704 closing.I sold it and went and opened my first saving account.",0

This company is a huge huge marketing success and that's it,but as GPRO taught us a lesson - you can't be stable in a long term if you have only powerful marketing, and your products have no real use in life.

Basic description of their products:

* Track steps - seriously? how can you benefit from tracking steps? Ok it might be good for runners, but you don't have to buy $100 watch to track your distance - you can use your phone for that.
* Alarms - come on, just learn about sleep cycles, you actually don't need this thing to sleep better.
* Watch - no comments, it's just a watch, not a high-status watch.
* Earn badges - no comments.

So, my point here is that soon people will recover from ""marketing magic"", and will forget about it like they forgot about GoPro. That's when the stock will slump.",0

I am just curious if anyone is either running a concentrated portfolio (5-10 max) and how investment decisions are made (buy, sell, rebalance). My main concern right now is diversifying for the sake of it, giving away opportunity for the relative safety of diversification. Now I am not talking about doubling down on speculative stocks like SUNE; I mostly buy some of the more boring GM, WFC, ABBV, GE and other value companies. 

One of the ideas that I struggle with is finding an attractive business and not going in with a significant amount of money because I might be wrong; also I do not want to end up following 80 companies like some of the bloggers I have seen (at what point is just better to put it on a mutual fund?).

16-03-31,4cs9s6,$BGMD deregistering all common stock. Game Over.,"Given the significant cost and resource demands of being a public company, on March 25, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company decided to voluntarily deregister the Company’s common stock under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and become a non-reporting company. In connection therewith, the Board of Directors approved the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission of a Form 15 to voluntarily deregister its securities under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and suspend its reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The Company expects to file the Form 15 in April 2016. The Company expects that its obligations to file periodic reports, such as Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, will be suspended immediately upon the filing of the Form 15 with the SEC, and its proxy statement, Section 16 and other Section 12(g) reporting responsibilities will terminate effective 90 days after the filing of the Form 15. The Company is eligible to deregister its common stock under the Exchange Act because its common stock is held by fewer than 300 stockholders of record. Following deregistration, the Company does not expect to publish periodic financial information or furnish such information to its stockholders except as may be required by applicable laws. As a result of the foregoing factors, deregistration will result in less disclosure about the Company and may negatively affect its ability to raise additional funds, the ability of its stockholders to sell its securities and the liquidity and trading prices of its common stock.",11

16-03-31,4coqv0,"Correlation Between Inflation, Interest Rates, and the Reserve Ratio","Alright so I have read quite a few investment books and listen to a couple investing podcasts. However, I still have a ways to go. One of the topics that was brought up was the correlation between the money supply, interest rates and inflation. However, I cannot seem to grasp the concept of how they are correlated. I am hoping someone can help explain this to me a little better. So I understand the fed will increase and decrease the reserve ratio in order to promote more lending on behalf of the banks or decrease the amount of lending that is occurring. As a result interest rates will be lower, since there is an increase in the supply of money, this would also cause economic inflation, which is part of the cycles we go through. From that more people would be willing to take out loans, and therefore spend more/ invest more. All of which increase the amount of money in circulation, therefore causing inflation. In order to stop a rapid amount of inflation, the fed would increase interest rates making it more costly to take out loans therefore decreasing the amount of spending and causing a recession.

 Now here is where I am confused. If you look at a chart that reflects the history of the money supply (Reserve Ratio) from 1940-1985, the money supply increases from 4.5 in 1940 to 12.1 in 1985. Now at this same time Interest rates increase from roughly 2% in 1940 to roughly 14% in 1981. Inflation on the under hand has its ups and downs however in 1980 it was close to 15%. 

How can all interest rates, inflation, and the money supply all be at high levels at the same time? If the money supply was constantly increasing, how come interest rates were as well? If interest rates were so high how come inflation was also super high? I was under the impression that when inflation is high, the fed would then raise rates causing a decrease in spending.

16-03-31,4codqi,Thoughts on Republic Airlines (RJETQ),"Hey Everyone,
I am an individual involved very closely with pilots coming out of college and moving onto regional airlines.  So a collegue mentioned the fact that Republic Airlines filed for Chapter 11 a couple weeks ago.  A main reason was the shortage of pilots and high aircraft lease expenses.  Republic airlines is one of the few airlines making a direct pathway for university educated pilots.  Many have stated that they would likely end up at Republic due to this pathway.  So I invested in Republic about a week ago @ $1.30, thinking the only other expense would be aircraft leases.  With that settled after chapter 11, what is everyones opinion on what the future holds for Republic (RJETQ)? They have doubled in stock price the past few days.  Is this a good one to take the profit and run, or let it ride back to where they were before $$$  ",3

16-03-31,4cot7v,$CLVS,"Company use to be worth 5x as much (~$100) back in November 2015. Then the FDA extended their PDUFA date by 3 months. People panicked and now the stock is trading around $20. Despite this, there has been more SC 13G and SC 13G/A filings this quarter than any other quarter.

There are even class-action law suits filed against this company claiming that they withheld information during a quarterly conference call. It seems as though a bunch of people got hyped into thinking that this company was going to take off and send them into retirement. When faced with a bit of bad news, people panicked and began to sell. 

The PDUFA date is June 28, 2016. However, the company is having an advisory committee meeting on April 12, 2016. If the board likes the drug, then hype picks up and we get a little rally/pump and dump going on. If the committee does not like the drug, then the price will drop, but not tank (I suspect) . Remember, the thing that matters most is the June 28 PDUFA date. The losses should not be much and the stock will recover.

The drugs seem a little promising but I ain't no fucking doctor. All three of their drugs are meant to treat cancer. None are in production although their main drug (Rociletinib) is suppose to be released later this year if approved by FDA. All three drugs are partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies. Two of the drugs have competitors in the market already, but CLVS drugs could topple them. Their lease developed drug (Lucitanib) is the most promising. Tests have proven to be effective. Now, CLVS is not paying for the development of this drug currently. Server, another pharmaceutical company, will pay the first 80 million euros for R&amp;D. The 420 pot infused brain management team in Colorado know how to deal like Trump. the fucking wall

Strategy is to wait until the current drop brings the price to $17 - $18. Buy it then and bag hold until April 12. 

Summary: You lazy motherfucker. I see undervalued company that has potential for hype/value. 

Throw me some criticisms. I need to know if this makes sense or if I need to take stop wasting my time.

&gt;On February 25, 2016, Eagle's CEO stated, regarding the pending New Drug Application (""NDA"") for the Company's anticoagulant drug KANGIO(TM), ""We have been interacting with FDA and we are preparing for launch, everything seems to be on track for a March 19 approval, and we anticipate shipping in late Q1 or early Q2."" However, on March 18, 2016, Eagle announced that it had received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA stating that the FDA ""cannot approve the application in its present form and requested additional information"" regarding the substances used in KANGIO(TM).

Would you be able to resell them back to the market? Assuming they are not expired.  I figured you can but I've tried searching a bunch and I can't get a solid answer to this. 

Also, does anyone have any experience with selling options before they have hit their strike price, but have moved much closer to the final strike price. Do they increase in value even if they aren't within the strike? Can you resell them for a gain?

The only problem is that, this being the Canadian market and therefore highly undiversified, add in an out-of-control housing bull market fraught with the risk of at least a slow, long decline, and with banks as 40% of the holdings of this ETF, I'm certainly highly motivated to lower volatility.

Now, being on the sell side, the only things I care about is how much (in percentage terms) out-of-the-money this option is and days-to-expiration. How should I get started? I have the idea of having options that expire in a month and doing it every month because of the rapid decay of such options. The most difficult part is how I should decide how much out-of-the-money I could relatively safely assume that the option won't be exercised, without sacrificing too much of the premium. Obviously, I don't want to sell it too soon, but have something else in mind--DRIP to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging and using call option premium earned to buy put options against the very same banks I'm afraid will plummet.",1

16-03-31,4csqzq,Hedging Covered Calls,"New to options trading but I have been immersed in learning and understanding the trade for a few months now and my portfolio has been doing very well on SCTY (Puts, then Calls), TSLA (calls), SQ (calls), and AMBA (calls- biggest return so far).

I want to sell covered calls on my SCTY shares but I'm nervous about losing the stock value because I'm extremely bullish and long on the stock. I have a scenario that I'm looking at trading tomorrow and I'm wondering 1. if there is a name for this and 2. is this a bad idea and i'm missing something?

So today I Sold 2 covered CALL for Apr 1 SCTY 23.5 at 1.34 with 8.45 in broker charges (259.55 in proceeds).

Because I'm long, my fear is that the stock jumps and I lose out on the gains. 

If I bought 2 Calls for Apr 1 SCTY 25 at .35 cents with 8.45 in broker fees, it would cost me 61.55 total. 

If the stock keeps soaring tomorrow (or at least breaks over 23.5+1.34), and the person who purchased my covered calls exercises the contract, I would be able to get right back in at 25. I would, however, lose the value of owning 200 shares from 23.5 to 25 (300), plus the cost of the call 61.55, but because of the premium I received from the covered call, I would only be down 102 in opportunity cost 259.99-(300+61.55).

If the stock stays around the same or drops and the contract is not executed, I can let my calls expire and my profit would be the premium received from the covered call minus the premium cost of the call (259.55-61.55) = $198.

So, I'm hedging the risk of my covered call at a maximum loss of $102, with a maximum upside of $198.

Is this a dumb strategy? Am I missing something? I would love to hear from someone else since all of my options experience has been me by myself. Thank you in advance.

16-03-31,4cq4oy,What does P/B actually mean?,"I've been reading about P/B ratios lately. What I can't wrap my head around is what do the various numbers actually mean? 

Some sources I read claimed that if we calculate a P/B ratio of 2.73 (for example), this means that under existing conditions, any accretion to equity will generate an additional market value equal to the P/B multiple of 2.73. So basically, the higher the P/B ratio, the higher is the earning power of equity.

So a high P/B ratio seems to often be a sign that a business has rosier future prospects that its past performance. When a share price is high relative to book value because investors have bid up the share price based on expectations of better earnings and/or cash flow ahead. 

And a low P/B ratio can reveal an undervalued stock but it can also indicate a company with serious underlying problems.  

I'm confused. If a company has a P/B ratio of 2 is that good? If a company has a P/B ratio of 35 is that a lot better? Is there a point of diminishing returns with P/B ratios?",7

Expecting it to briefly touch $35 by early June.

Stop loss set at -15% of my cost basis.

**Reasons to be long:**

* GE appears to have gone ahead with the major portion of its buyback. Outstanding shares are currently sitting at 9.29B, down from around 10.11B a couple weeks ago. The media has not really brought this up yet... and that is almost a 10% decrease in shares outstanding.

* Last night GE applied to lose it's SIFI designation. Met-Life is the only other company to ever to go through this process and it took around 2 months for approval.

* GE's Digital (Industrial Internet) play is now in effect. 

* Most of GE's divisions seem to be expected to post solid numbers.

* Any positive mentioning of the dividend could inspire more buying

**Things to watch out for:**

* GE is around #10 on the ""most shorted stocks"" list

* The Oil &amp; Gas division is still likely to be shaky for obvious reasons.

* The Healthcare division may be shaky as well (Obamacare effects are finally starting to take its toll on the healthcare industry).

However, when you do a history check of stock prices, it shows the highest Apple value at 132 in May 2015. I understand they did a split, but why isn't the 700ish high show up in the history?

16-03-31,4cr6ov,Confusion about Pattern Day Trader,"I have a bit of confusion about day trading.  Unknown to me were separate rules for [Pattern Day Traders](http://www.finra.org/investors/day-trading-margin-requirements-know-rules).  I am fairly new to trading and don't plan to day trade for a while, if ever, but wanted to make sure that I'm understanding this classification correctly.  Here are some questions and example scenarios:

* I didn't see any mention of extra fees (other than broker) if you are considered a Pattern Day Trader.  Is this correct also?  The only requirement I noticed was that you must maintain $25,000 in your account.

* Is the number of trades per day limited?  Could I buy and sell 100 times in one day and be safe?  It sounds like 4 out of 5 days is the key requirement.

* Maybe a dumb scenario, but if I day trade Mon-Wed and do nothing Thurs-Friday, that's OK right since it's 3 out of 5 days?

Thanks for any clarification!
