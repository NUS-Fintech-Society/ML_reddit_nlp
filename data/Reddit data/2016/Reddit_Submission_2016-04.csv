I guess I'll switch to limit orders and avoid this funny business. I don't like limit orders since they don't always fill. Is there some way to tell the order to fill at market price whatever that is BUT if a few shares are a very different price than the opening price don't bother? ",0

I am considering focusing on Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND) in the future, especially after watching most of the market plunge today. I have heard of the economic slowdown in Asia and South America, and some of the debt issues in the EU that still need to be resolved.

I intend on buying and holding BND until during the worst of the next recession, and then sell the holdings to reinvest in other stocks while they're at their lowest price (as long as the company doesn't have too much debt or other warning signs of bankruptcy).

Also, I invested a fair amount into Wells Fargo after reading that Warren Buffet is also increasing his stake in it. Some of the stocks in my portfolio are there because his company had a significant stock holding in them.

EDIT: I want to avoid stocks with K-1 dividends, because I've read that doing tax returns with Schedule K-1s (Form 1065) is a pain in the rear end.

EDIT2: I originally planned on buying more of the individual stocks instead of the ETFs, but now I'm having second thoughts and maybe I should buy bonds instead.",1

Were there any common mistaken assumptions among top managers? If so, what can we learn from them?","Reading the book Hedge Fund Wizards right now. First chapter is an interview with Colm O'Shea. He seems like a really bright guy who I mostly agree with philosophically, and at the time of writing he had never had a money losing year in his career, and even profited during the financial crisis.  He had a reputation for playing it safe and not making any rash bets that could cost him all of his money if he was wrong. 

And yet a Google search reveals that even his fund lost money and closed over the past year. In fact many well-known investors who called the crisis have been badly underperforming the market.  Makes me wonder: if even these guys can't seem to make a return in this environment, what chance does a guy like me have?

Abiomed is a mid cap medical technology company that supplies circulatory support devices. 

""We are a leading provider of temporary percutaneous mechanical circulatory support devices and we offer a continuum of care to heart failure patients. We develop, manufacture and market proprietary products that are designed to enable the heart to rest, heal and recover by improving blood flow to the coronary arteries and end-organs and/or temporarily performing the pumping function of the heart. Our products are used in the cath lab by interventional cardiologists, the electrophysiology lab, the hybrid lab and in the heart surgery suite by heart surgeons. A physician may use our devices for patients who are in need of hemodynamic support before, during or after angioplasty or heart surgery procedures. We believe heart recovery is the optimal clinical outcome for patients experiencing heart failure because it enables patients to go home with their own native heart and restores their quality of life. In addition, we believe that for the care of such patients, heart recovery is the most cost-effective solution for the healthcare system."" - ABMD annual report.

According to the AHA, Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics 2014 Update Report, coronary heart disease, or CHD, causes approximately one of every seven deaths in the United States. Coronary heart disease is a condition of the coronary arteries that causes reduced blood flow and insufficient oxygen delivery to the affected portion of the heart. Coronary heart disease leads to AMI, commonly known as a heart attack, which may lead to heart failure, a condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to the body’s major organs. In 2011, CHD mortality was 375,295. Each year, an estimated 635,000 Americans have a new coronary attack (defined as first hospitalized myocardial infarction or coronary heart disease death) and approximately 300,000 have a recurrent attack. It is estimated that an additional 155,000 “silent” first myocardial infarctions occur each year

ABMD's revenue (TTM) has risen for more than five consecutive quarters. One year ago the firm reported $210 million in revenue. For the most recent year it reported $303 million (a 44.0% one-year rise). Two-years ago the firm reported annual revenue of $177 million (up 71.4%). The company has steadily been increasing revenue every year since 2004, from under $50 million to over $300 million today. The company became profitable in 2012 and net income has surged from $18 million in the 4th quarter of 2014 to $126 million in the 4th quarter of 2015. Net Income (after tax profit) over the trailing twelve months (TTM) for ABMD is rising. For the most recent trailing-twelve-months (TTM) the company reported net income of $126 (million). That's an increase in the most recent year from $18 (million) or a 583.57% change.

Most of the revenue generated comes from its Impella line of products which the company plans to continue focusing on in the future. The Impella product portfolio, which includes the Impella 2.5, Impella CP, Impella RP, Impella LD and Impella 5.0, has supported over 25,000 patients in the U.S. In July of 2014 they purchased ECP for $13 million. ECP, based in Berlin, Germany, is engaged in research, development, prototyping and the pre-serial production of a percutaneous expandable catheter pump which increases blood circulation from the heart with an external drive shaft.

Fiscal third quarter 2016 worldwide Impella® heart pump revenue totaled $81.0 million, an increase of 41% compared to revenue of $57.4 million during the same period of the prior fiscal year. U.S. Impella heart pump revenue grew 45% to $75.0 million from $51.9 million in the prior fiscal year with U.S. patient usage of the Impella heart pumps up 45%

The company has steadily increased operating margins since 2002 but is down from a year ago. 1.27 compared to 1.30. Gross margins have consistently remained around 80% over the past few years. Revenue per employee is below peer group average at $391,000 compared to WCG with a revenue per employee of 2 million. Capital Expenditures (TTM US$ Millions) in the most recent quarter for ABMD was $11 million. CapEx is rising (304.49%) from last year's value of $3 million. Further, we can see that CapEx today relative to two-years ago is increasing (255.27%) from last year's value of $3 million. Net cash balances were $60 million in 2011 to today at $146 million. 

""Impella product revenues for fiscal 2015 increased by $45.7 million, or 27%, to $212.7 million from $167.0 million for fiscal 2014. Most of our increase in Impella revenue was from disposable catheter sales in the U.S., as we focus on increasing utilization of our disposable catheter products through continued investment in our field organization and physician training programs. Impella product revenues outside the US increased by $6.2 million, or 41%, during fiscal 2015. Most of this increase was due to Impella product sales in Europe, primarily Germany, as we continue to expand our commercial infrastructure there. We expect Impella revenues to continue to increase with our recent PMA approval in the U.S. and as we add new customer sites, increase utilization at existing customer sites, continue our commercial launch of Impella CP, begin our introduction of Impella RP to the market and expand our efforts in Europe."" - ABMD annual report

Since 2002 the company has steadily increased gross margins from 60% to over 80%. Meanwhile they have been able to lower their SGA margins from a 80% high in 2008 to todays margin of below 50%. The company has steadily increased revenue per employee is 2002 from below $100 thousand to over $300 thousand today. The company continues to spend on research and development along with increasing earnings. 

ABMD holds no debt and generated $20.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, totaling $196.2 million as of December 31, 2015, compared to $175.5 million at September 30, 2015. This is a company that has grown into a very financially sound medical company. 

Here are some potential problems: ""On October 26, 2012, we were informed that the Department of Justice, United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia was conducting an investigation, or the “Marketing and Labeling Investigation” focused on our marketing and labeling of the Impella 2.5. On October 31, 2012, we accepted service of a subpoena related to this investigation seeking documents related to the Impella 2.5. We believe that we have substantially complied with the subpoena and have submitted the requested documents to the United States Attorney’s Office. On September 13, 2013, we entered into a tolling agreement with the United States Attorney’s Office, pursuant to which we and the United States Attorney’s Office mutually agreed to toll the applicable statutes of limitations for all criminal, civil and administrative offenses and violations that could be charged or claimed against us as of that date.

On May 27, 2014 and January 30, 2015, we executed extensions of the tolling agreement. These extensions expired on March 2, 2015. The investigation is ongoing and we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome or determine whether a liability has been incurred or make an estimate of the reasonably possible liability, if any, that could result from any unfavorable outcome associated with this investigation. We have incurred significant expenses related to this investigation and we could continue to incur additional expenses in the future related to this action. On April 25, 2014, we received a subpoena from the Boston regional office of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, Office of Inspector General requesting materials relevant to our reimbursement of expenses and remuneration to healthcare providers for a six month period from July 2012 through December 2012 in connection with a civil investigation under the False Claims Act (the “FCA Investigation” and, together with the Marketing and Labeling Investigation, the “DOJ Investigations”).

We submitted the requested documents to HHS and believe that we have substantially complied with the subpoena. On November 6, 2014, we received notice from the Department of Justice, United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts in the form of a Civil Investigative Demand (“CID”) requesting additional materials relating to this matter for the time period of January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2013. We are currently in the process of responding to the additional requests for information contained in the CID and intend to continue to cooperate with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in connection with the FCA investigation."" - Annual report.

""The Company is increasing its fiscal year 2016 guidance for total revenue to be approximately $326 million, indicating a growth rate greater than 41% over the prior year. Previous guidance was in the range of $305 million to $315 million, which had indicated an increase of 32% to 37% from the prior year. This guidance projects revenue to be approximately $90 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The Company is increasing its fiscal year 2016 guidance for GAAP operating margin to greater than 17%, updated from the previous guidance range of 15% to 17%. "" - ABMD annual report

Another thing to note is that the company's net income of $117 million up from $7 million in 2014 is primarily from an income tax benefit of $84.9 million 

http://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/abiomed%20inc/815094/

From a technical perspective the company looks great. ABMD is up +0.3% over the last three months and up +4.6% over the last six months. The stock price is up +32.4% over the last year. In 2014 the stock traded in the $24 range and has since exploded over $100. Today the price currently sits at $93.11 which is above both the 200 and 50 day moving averages and has seemed to break through a consolidation the stock experienced during the summer volatility. I believe the stock is set to test all time highs of $110.68 again. ",2

16-04-01,4cu9r5,"The ""affordable"" Tesla - long term math","Good bantz today on the topic.  Wanted to bring this up for everyone. For the record I am very long TSLA but personally would not get in at today's valuation.

Model 3 costs $35k.  The average new car in the US costs $33.5k [Link](http://mediaroom.kbb.com/new-car-transaction-prices-jump-august-2015) That average of course is brought up by all luxury cars, big trucks and SUVs, etc.

Even at $33.5k, Americans can't actually afford new cars [Link](http://www.autoblog.com/2014/03/12/who-can-afford-the-average-car-price-only-folks-in-washington/)

That link is a little old but basically like in all things we're all idiots buying shit we can't afford because credit is cheap.  

Tesla says it already has 115k orders.  And won't START producing until the end of 2017.  Its factory can produce 500k cars a year (of all models) at PEAK.  That requires the Gigafactory online which is a couple years away at least and moving all the way up the learning curve.  You're looking at at least 2020 to get to that rate.  

So even these first pre-orders in a perfect world are going to be delivered through 2018.  The way the current tax credits work when Tesla delivers 200k cars, 6 months after that there are no more tax credits to reduce the net price of the car.  (I may have some of the details of that off there's been a lot of debate on the subject today) but in any case - the subsidy goes away before Tesla really sells a material amount of Model 3.  So you can't just say ""oh but net of the tax credit it's cheaper.""  Obviously the law may change.

So out of these 115,000 people - two+ years from now you have to go to them and each of them has to come up with, instead of a $1,000 deposit, the down payment for a $35,000 car and the ability to finance the rest.  

Of course interest rates will have risen by a percent or two by then.

And of course $35k is just for the base model.

A $35,000 car that's available no earlier than 2 years from now is not an iPhone available next week.  Tesla has yet to deliver on an ENTIRE OTHER model of vehicle that people are waiting on before it even gets around to this thing.

Google wants its self driving car on the road by 2020. Obviously Tesla will have a role in the self driving future but the window to outright sell cars to individuals is also very thin if experts and the major companies throwing billions are to be believed - so there's that to be considered too, Tesla is evidently going to invest huge into locations and chargers and etc. - all at cost to them. If their focus is too heavily on just how to make a car while other, better capitalized rivals go out and change what a car is they might always be a step behind.

That's my take.

EDIT: BTW, hoping that at least one discussion on TSLA can be with adults that know something so I'll add that - TSLA trades at 7.4x sales.  That means that even if they actually sold a car to every single person mentioned in the preorder, and it cost them zero dollars to make any of those cars and paid no one at the company, and then they took all that money and directly returned it to shareholders - shareholders would still need them to do that 6.4 more times to justify the current valuation.  So please don't fucking come in here with math about how the huge amount of pre-orders directly justifies anything.  It's an interesting data point but it has no frame of reference and this is a $30 billion market cap company that trades in the stratosphere. ",32

Right now, some of my holdings are Costco, Southwest Airlines, Chipotle, Honda and Merck.

A little background, just bought a house at 300K with 20% down, now trying to do the right thing with my portfolio - go ahead and beat me up like a punching bag.  I'm prepared to work until I'm 65.  This isn't a lot of money, but one day I'm sure it will be. I'm nearing my 3.5 year anniversary mark at my first job out of college.

* *4.08%* - 3 year return

Roth IRA - **$6,000**

* 90% VTI - 0.05% Expense Ratio
* *10%* - 3 year return

* *-1.59%* - 3 year return

Should I add some bonds here?  Do I need to diversify myself more?  Shouldn't I be allocating stock to my Roth IRA because if I make the most gains in there, it's already taxed so it puts me at an advantage?

16-04-01,4cwkki,The Big Short Explained Again,"[Liberty Street Economics did a great post](http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2016/04/hey-economist-what-did-you-make-of-the-big-short.html#.Vv6MfvkrJph) about their thoughts on *The Big Short*.  There was a lot of misinformation in [this thread the other day](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/4ckpi4/the_big_short_explained/), so I thought I would post something from actual economists who understood better and have taken the time to answer some more popular questions about the crisis.

There were a couple of things from the video that could have been misleading, and I included my extra (way too long) explanations in footnotes to keep it somewhat coherent:

* Michael Burry did not short mortgage backed securities.  Borrow in these bonds was virtually non existent, and still is today.  He shorted CDOs, or collateralized debt obligations.  Specifically, he shorted synthetic CDOs.  What is a synthetic CDO, you might ask? (footnote 1).  The creation of these synthetic CDOs was actually pretty complicated, but most were pools of credit default swaps on underlying mortgage backed security tranches.  So to create one of these, a bank would issue or find a bunch of credit default swaps, package them together into a CDO, and sell the risk to opposing parties who wanted to bet for or against the housing market.  The guys who were ""long"" the CDO would technically be the ones selling the CDS (footnote 2), and the guys who were ""short"" the CDO would be the ones buying CDS.  Burry also presumably bought CDS.

* CDS do not have to bought from an insurance company.  A bunch of counterparties trade CDS, and even though they are very ""insurance-like"", they trade just like regular over-the-counter financial instruments.  So for example, let's say I have a CDO tranche that's trading at par (par == 100 cents on the dollar), but I am worried that it's possible I will receive less than par in the near future.  I can find a counterparty to buy CDS on this tranche from, and then I will be made whole in the case of a default.  What constitutes a default? (footnote 3).

If you would like to read some short but good explanations for the financial crisis (note they don't all agree), I would recommend the following:

* [Turing Finance: Recipe for the Financial Crisis](http://www.turingfinance.com/recipe-for-the-financial-crisis/)
* [Yes, the Fed's Errors Made Recession Worse](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2016-02-08/our-critics-are-wrong-the-fed-erred-in-2008)
* [Turns Out the Housing Crisis Wasn't All About Subprime](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-09-14/turns-out-the-housing-crisis-wasn-t-all-about-subprime)
* [Confusion About the Financial Crisis Won't Die](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2016-01-28/confusion-about-the-financial-crisis-won-t-die)

I can also answer any other questions or try and point people in the right direction.

Footnotes:

1. Well, it's anything.  I can take anything with value (art, real estate, stocks, bonds, loans, you name it) and create a CDO.  The objective of CDOs are to change the risk profile of an investment for investors with different tastes in risk.  Generally speaking, there was (and still is) a lot of demand for high quality risky securities, and less demand for lower quality risky securities.  However, in the real world, there are more lower quality risky assets than there are higher quality ones.  CDOs are inventive way of bridging this gap; it takes a pool of risky securities, and realigns that risk for investors.  Let's say I have a $1 million pool of 100 loans, each with exactly a 50% chance of paying off.  If I tried to sell the loans individually, they would all be pretty damn risky.  However, if I pool them together and sell individual risk tranches, then I can create much safer securities (and much riskier ones).  So let's say I split the entire pool of loans into ten tranches, where the lowest tranche (we'll call it tranche J) is the first tranche to take any losses, and the highest tranche (called tranch A) will be the last to take any losses.  So the breakdown is as follows:

* Tranche A - 10%
* Tranche B - 10%
* Tranche C - 10%
* Tranche D - 10%
* Tranche E - 10%
* Tranche F - 10%
* Tranche G - 10%
* Tranche H - 10%
* Tranche I - 10%
* Tranche J - 10%

So, as you can see, Tranche A is a pretty damn safe bet.  Tranches B through J have to be completely wiped out in order for an investor in Tranche A to lose a single dollar.  This cushion is called ""credit enhancement"", and is an important part of securitized products.  Tranche J, on the other hand, looks really risky.  The lower tranches in a stack are usually referred to as the equity or mezzanine tranches, since they carry the most risk, but also the most reward.  Though this is an unrealistic example, you can imagine that an investor in Tranche J would probably demand several times the amount of interest that an investor in Tranche A might.  It is in this way that we have taken a large pool of very risky loans, and created a much less risky product for some investors.

2. If you are ""selling"" a CDS, it means you are ""long risk"".  Or, in other words, you're the one selling insurance to the party who wants to buy it.  The party buying CDS, also known as ""selling risk"", is the one who is buying insurance and is hoping for the underlying security to fail.  The easiest way to think about this is that selling CDS == long, buying CDS == short.

3. Even guys with law degrees from Harvard debate that.  [ISDA](http://www2.isda.org/) is the organization that generally makes the final decision, but each contract has its own definition of ""default"", and even each counterparty has their own interpretation of what that contract means when it says ""default"".  Now you know why lawyers at investment banks make the big bucks; winning lawsuits in these disputes can mean hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars one way or the other.  The payout on CDS is also not binary in the sense that it's either activated or it's not.  When ISDA has determined that a ""default event"" has occurred, owners of CDS are ""made whole"" on their investment, which requires an auction on the underlying security in order to determine the market price of the now-defaulted bonds.  Let's say investors determine that the defaulted bonds are now worth 30 cents on the dollar (i.e., a restructuring or liquidation would result in them getting paid about that much).  ISDA would determine that owners of the CDS on those bonds are entitled to 70% of the face value of their CDS.  The scary part is, that's just for the more common forms of CDS; the market has come a long way in homogenizing these securities, but there are still a ton of forms CDS can take since they are traded over the counter.  Or in other words, two counterparties can agree to create a contract for just about anything they want as long as they find a price they can agree on.  The end result is pretty much just more money for good lawyers.",27

16-04-01,4cxc9c,"I have an idea, please poke holes in it","I won't go into immense detail with specific statistics, rates, numbers etc. as I am not even quite sure if the moral/ethical aspect of this hypothesis is appropriate. But anyway, here goes nothing:

Many of you might be aware of SLABS (student loan asset backed securities) and the parallels they draw with the securitized mortgages that ultimately led to the 2008 financial crisis. Much like the MBS's, SLABS are divided into tranches and treated similarly to any other security; however, unlike MBS's, student loans are not distributed on the basis of the student's future employment, meaning that if families X and Y make the same amount of money and have virtually identical lifestyles, but their children major in finance and English lit., they will both receive the same amount of student loans, be it from P2P, government, or private distributors. You can already see how this might be a problem: the English lit. major, under 99% of all circumstances, will make less money than the finance major throughout their career and therefore pay-off their student loans at a much slower rate.

Governmental student loans, while smaller (and shrinking in size every year), have lower interest rates than their P2P and private counter parts. As such, the current trend is to pay off loans from P2P's and banks first and then the government loans, a trend that is making it more difficult for the government to distribute loans in the future, as the returns are being realized in smaller amounts and over longer periods of time.

So it begs the question: why do students with vastly differing future income prospects receive the same amount of student aid? This is where ethics comes in: it is every American's right to receive an education. Yet, with the cyclical trend of delinquent students choosing unprofitable majors and not paying off their loans in a timely manner, they are inhibiting future students' access to loans, which in itself is an ethical dilemma: should you choose a major that can ultimately bar a future student from receiving a loan? Of course that's an extreme way of thinking, but you get the picture. 

This is a proposed solution that I've been mulling. Now, toss your moral compass out the window and keep in mind that I am not discrediting or shaming any ""unprofitable"" major or area of expertise. Basically, there are quite a few statistics on employment and majors tied with employment (i.e. X% of Y majors end up in XX sector and so on and so forth), including average salaries right out of college. I propose that as opposed to unilaterally distributing loans on the basis of the student's family income, loans should be distributed (including interest rates, loan gross amount) as a function of future employment and salary. For instance, if 95% of English majors end up unemployed or employed in a irrelevant sector, they simply shouldn't be given the same amount of money as a student who goes into, say, computer science or engineering. You might ask, well won't that discourage English as a major? Well yes, that's the point. There is clearly low demand for people with that major and, as more and more people choose not to major in English, the hope is that rates will normalize over the long-run and people who major in English will not find it as competitive of a field as previously thought. 

Of course, this will need yearly or semi-annual adjustments according to more recent census data and, while this may initially bare expenses of their own, the decrease in delinquency rates may encourage the government to subsidize some of these costs. After all, the goal of the program wouldn't be to increase profitability, it would be to tackle a nation-wide unemployment issue, in addition to circumventing a potential bubble in SLABS. 

Tell me what you think, ask any questions and I'll clarify. ",1

16-04-01,4cw97k,General/Theoretical question about stocks and price changes after hourse,"Hi all,

I was just looking at the Tesla stock and I was wondering about how the market 'moves' at night?

I noticed that the market jumped 15 points (from about 230 to 245) but then within the first hour dropped to about 240.

My question is what determines how stocks move when the market is closed? Is it just that there were trades placed during the night and then they all bought right when the market opened increasing the price? at which point people then sold decreasing it?

And if I placed a trade at night would I get the stock at the closing price? or at the opening price?

Thanks for the help.

I wanted to post about this since the news broke, but I've been swamped with interviews, calls, ongoing research, and of course, the occasional cigarette. 


Upon further research, I sold UWTI at a 10% gain and shorted that bitch down to the Earth's core. Those mother fuckers down at marketwatch wrote like I moved from my mansion to the streets to make a quick buck. Jokes on them! 


I skipped my yacht purchase since there won't be any point for me to be on the water. In a few months, I am taking my newly purchased rocket ship and traveling around space to reward myself for not being a money losing faggot. The moon and Mars will be my first destinations and I hope to enter Uranus's atmosphere, but I'm not sure my busy schedule will allow for it.


If you read my [original post,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3vwcls/we_are_bringing_oil_to_the_moon_with_us/) Randy is now behind bars for stealing a prosthetic hand to replace the 3 fingers he lost as a punishment for his male stripper business. I took a trip down to the Bahamas to see him and he's in good spirits, but misses the group of strippers he was able to give careers to. Don't tell anyone, but I'm the one that set that bitch up in the first place to get myself a pretty penny for it hehehe.


I don't know what trade is next for me, but I do know it's going to be a winner. I'll let my wallstreetbets fam and the new fools from marketwatch who stumbled into this place know so you all might be able to take a trip to the moon someday.

16-04-01,4cwwry,Is this a normal policy for a broker (commission on partially filled orders)?,"I've been using TD Direct and am mostly happy with it. However, the other day I noticed that this scenario occurs:

• I create a purchase order for 100 shares until cancel.

• 90 shares are purchased, fulfilling 90% of my order. $9.99 is charged for commission.

• Later that day, 10 more shares are purchased. ANOTHER $9.99 is charged for commission even though I only opened a single purchase order.
 
This is especially aggravating because there is no ""all or none"" option on the TSX as far as I can tell, and I am also completely unaware of this happening unless I am constantly monitoring my order status and cancelling when they are partially fulfilled, otherwise I may be charged commission half a dozen times before my order is completely filled. I have no problem paying the standard commission but this seems completely unfair to me as an investor. It creates risk on opening an order (beyond the obvious risks) because my order may be 20% filled, leaving me stuck between a wall and a hard place, as my options at that point are to either leave it open and potentially be charged commission over and over again, or cancel it and make the original purchase virtually pointless.

Obviously this is mostly a problem when trading stocks that are not always liquid, but that happens to be one of the main types of trades that I make. Is this just something everyone has to deal with, or am I getting shafted by TD?",2

16-04-02,4czhq8,[Rant] VIX is deeply oversold,"Noob here, but I think we all know what happened to the VIX and the S&amp;P 500. Namely, the S&amp;P 500 went from 2050 to 1810 and then back to 2070 within 3 months; for VIX, during the same period, it went from 15.6 to 28.1 and back to 13.1. Because of the speed and range of this move, I believe that the VIX is, for now, very deeply oversold. Unless earnings continue to grow, I don't believe that the S&amp;P 500 will set a new record very far above its last one for a while. In fact, You see, with all this stuff happening around us (the Fed jawboning about another rate hike, oil volatility [not over yet], terrorist attacks, Brexit threat, Chinese economic slowdown, etc...), this is probably going down (i.e. correction) in the near term...

Anyone else that thinks buying VIX when the cash settlement value is at 13.1 and front month future is 15.43? I think that unless something terribly wrong occurs (think bubble), taking a 5-10% profit in a month doesn't seem too outlandish to me.",1

Well. After about a collective of 24 hours of research on prader-willi syndrome (pws), pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and general obesity, we've reasoned that 1) the amount of people that died was completely in the realm of possibility (without the drug) and 2) the amount of pulmonary embolism and events were also accounted for in these populations.

I'm going to get blasted for this, but you can wait until we publish the final draft, but... The placebo arm was extremely lucky (and thus zfgns stock price wasn't).

16-04-02,4d0f9e,"If you wish to become truly wealthy, you must take risks. The game you play as a small fish is very different than that of a whale.","Everyone needs to play a little game called http://agar.io.  It is a microcosm of every competitive system, including the stock market.  
  
The whales in the investing world don't care to have more competition at their level.  This is why they encourage small investors to simply hand over their ammo to *them* so they can generate reasonable returns with it (while themselves getting substantially richer in the process).  They want to keep the peasants as small and humble bubbles, or at worst let them grow to become medium-sized allies.  
  
But this is a quiet surrender for the new player.  This is admitting defeat early.  And what usually happens to the 'good little bubbles' in such a game?  That's right - they play along like they're supposed to, generating value for the big guys... right up until one of the rival whales decides to include them in their lunch.  We see this metaphor take form as major market crashes and swings, when a whale decides that there are just a few too many minnows swimming in a region and opens his jaws to consume the lot.  
  
The stock market is a vicious ocean.  Those with great capital are protected from its dog-eat-dog reality by being able to somewhat defend themselves.  They have the luxury of having more chips in the game to throw around, and usually the wisdom to understand how to manage such a stack.  This lets them increase the size of their 'medium bubbles' in a responsible way while warding off any hungry whales that begin pushing them around.  
  
But the true little guy?  The individual investor?  Forget about it!  They are an invisible speck in this giant warzone, and their future is bleak.  For many who don't have the stomach to get gobbled up and lose everything there really is no other solution - they must throw their army in with any medium-sized bubble that will have them and let someone else play this awful game.  
  
*But for some of us, that isn't good enough*.  We don't want to feed a medium bubble and share in their scraps - **we want to get on that leaderboard ourselves**.  We want to be a big fish.  We want to be the commander of our own financial destiny.  
  
And this part is scary.  This is dangerous.  This can incur severe losses, especially when you take the proper risks necessary to attempt to advance up the ladder.  
  
You can work your 9 to 5 grind, shove your money into funds and indices that will return 3% to 10% a year, and yes - maybe shortly before you die you'll have a nice million dollar nest egg to pass down to your offspring (*so they can waste it, because what isn't earned usually isn't appreciated*).  
  
Or if you are young, you can do what it takes to try to become one of those truly big bubbles - **you can dare to fail**.  And fail you will: picking individual assets is a ridiculously hard game where the odds are against you, and you may try your entire life and still die broken and penniless.  It's up to you to decide whether that's preferable to being a good little bubble and earning your fair share through decades of slow expansion.  
  
Make no mistake, the moment the larger players sense you are stepping out of line and picking individual stocks or assets they will be ruthless: How *dare* you think you can compete on their level!  Get back into your hole, and don't you dare try to rise above your preordained tax bracket again!  
  
They will insult you and tear at you mercilessly, because the scariest thing for them is not that you might lose your money; it's that you might actually be right.  Even if you do win, no one will be waiting to pat you on the back to congratulate you.  Your victory fanfare will be the cold slow claps of your enemies as they rethink their strategy and wonder how to take back your new fortune.  Life is not comfortable once you leave the soft and safe lands of the little bubbles.  A general can never truly relax, and your assets will eventually form a mighty army if you win enough.  
  
But it's worth it.  It's worth it to live your own life and not be a slave to a larger system.  Its worth it to be a real player, and take your own risks.  You must be comfortable being wrong, as making money is a miserable affair: you will be buying terror and will likely feel awful about it.  On the other side of the trade you will be the miserly wretch selling at maximum euphoria, raining down on the parades of others.  
  
This is the path of profits though, and each has to decide on the life they want to live: will you spend your days as a comfortable little bubble beholden to a kind master, or dare to become a truly free agent with all the power, prestige, and risk that comes along with that declaration?.  ",0

I make 5% a month (for the past 18 months) with a $10,000 investment, trading around 20 times a month. 

I'm making 60% + a year. But the issue that I'm having is that I'm also spending $3360 a year.

Wouldn't it be better for me to just open a index fund and invest around $500 a month with a 10k initial investment?

I found an interesting app called Acorn, seems fairly cheap and since I am a student it would be free for me to use until I'm 24.

16-04-02,4d3su2,"Can you predict when the Sneaker ""bubble"" will burst?","So I read an article on yahoo about people making quite a bit of money speculating on sneakers. They buy shoes with a low supply that you think will be in high demand using bots to place orders, and then resell them immediately for large markups or wait to see if the price goes up even more over time.

To me this sounds just like Beanie Babies; the difference is that the supply of Beanie Babies was increased dramatically and marketed as a long term investment, where this kind of marketing will not happen for sneakers.

So anyway, in 10, 20 years will we be hearing about people who have thousands of pairs of brand new sneakers in pristine condition in their basement that are all worthless? Or will they go up in price, stay about the same?

They do have more of an intrinsic value than Beanie Babies because people need shoes... but they could fall in price to be worth the same as any old cheap pair of shoes worth $20, or at the least, lose all of the speculative component to their price.

What do you guys think? Just trying to expand everyones mind.",1

Let's say 250k people preorder at 1000 dollars that's an investment of .25bn dollars. Would this cause the stock value to go up and therefore have a sizeable effect on the market cap (increase greater than 0.25bn). What is to stop people with a vested interest in the Tesla shares (people with a big exposure to the market value) just fake preordering (I mean they can cancel later anyway) to simulate massive interest and watch the share prices go up tremendously, then sell off the shares (profit), then cancel their preorders? Are there any institutions with large enough exposure to Tesla and enough liquidity to pull off something like this?",1

16-04-03,4d62zn,Ethanol Short Term DD,"There’s been a tremendous acceleration in the adoption of ethanol for the past few years. For the first time, Ethanol will make up more than 10% of U.S. gasoline, breaking through so-called blend wall. If you want more details read [this](http://goo.gl/XjE2tc).  

 
Moving on, for the last decade or so, % of corn (which is used to make Ethanol) used to make ethanol has been stagnant due to this blend wall. [See charts](https://imgur.com/a/Jlkxc).
Now that we can finally move past this 10% mark + more vehicles accepting ethanol blend + US wanting to become energy independent, we can expect more corns being planted. And that’s exactly what’s happening right now, see [USDA 2016 Prospective Plantings](http://goo.gl/ezMoGu).  

The corn market reacted to the unexpected supply pretty violently but movement in Ethanol is subdued w/ low volume. There’s a very good chance Ethanol will follow corn lower in the coming week. [See chart](https://imgur.com/R4dPsfO).

16-04-03,4d7ava,US dollar: what is next?,"We’re still in favour to US dollar buy. Here is our key talking points.

- US Economy is strengthening
- US dollar currencies have moved above its “crisis period”
- US dollar weakening is limited
- We are favour on buying US dollar

Last Friday, April 1 2016, right on the April Fool Day, we saw “unconvincing” US economic data. While Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) that shows monthly additional employment rose, overall employment figure said there were some crunches in the labor market. The impact, US dollar jumped for a while and incrementally slower toward the end of trading day.

Just view days before NFP data, we heard The Fed Governor, Yellen, said that the US economy should be warned of global slowdown and therefore, took a way to accommodate it. Market saw that statement as “dovish” and resulted the lower US dollar.

Now we raised the questions. What is actually happening with US economy? And furthermore, how we trade US dollar? The questions is simple. US economy is doing fine. And we are still in favour buying US dollar currencies.

However, still, cautious always there. US economy is not great yet – as what Donald Trump wants to ‘harshly’ go. But it is not that bad. We see some halts, but not really matters expect to keep it in pre-emptive mode. Shortly speaking, The Fed is “playing small” in keeping up US dollar.

Now talking to strategy. Baseline view is, US dollar has been moving away from its “global crisis” level in 2006 – 2010. It has broken the resistance and stepped on consolidation phase. While US dollar in sideways, one to see is how global economy will be doing as we have founded that Yellen move has been allegedly caused by China over-hyped economy.

By saying that, we believe US are playing smart here. US dollar is good, but it shouldn’t be that good to hamper US business and trade balance. Because, there is no point of keeping good while you can’t sell your products abroad.

Cynically, US want to be able to do export again. And to do so, they need to “help” China. It simply an “I make you rich so you can buy mine” rule.

16-04-03,4d8j3u,[Discussion] Which Broker is your favorite and why?,"Hello,

As the title states I was wondering who your broker of choice is and why? The reason I'm asking this questions mainly is because I want to hear your opinions on which broker you chose and why. I would like to open an investment account sometime this summer with a few grand and start actually trading stocks, but I haven't completely decided on a broker. However, I have looked at a lot of the other threads, FAQ's and sidebar Info.

Currently my Top Choices would have to be Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade or Fidelity.

Edit: I have a good amount of experience with stocks, although I personally haven't traded it much. I am a portfolio analyst for the Student Managed Investment Portfolio club at my school.

16-04-03,4d8lvq,What are some more examples of stock hedging?,"A couple months ago, I heard about a specific type of investment hedging, which I can't remember the name of--hence the vague title (sorry).


Basically, instead of investing in different classes of assets, one invests in a pair of stocks whose performances contrast regarding the economic climate and financial health of the country.


Here's the example I heard: If one is going to invest in retail, buy similarly weighted positions in JC Penney and Michael Kors. If economic climate improves, say unemployment decreases and consumer spending increases, all else held constant the Michael Kors stock will increase because people are willing to spend more money, so they will gravitate towards more expensive brands. Therefore, JC Penney stock would theoretically decrease. 


If unemployment increases and consumer spending decreases, all else held constant the JC Penney stock will increase because consumers gravitate towards cheaper products during economic downturns. Therefore, the Michael Kors stock will decrease.


This investing theory seems intriguing and I want to hear some other examples. Plus learning its actual name would be nice too.",10

For some time now I've been educating and readying myself to start a portfolio based on the Bogle principle. I've read 'The Bogleheads guide to investing' and 'The Global Expatriate's Guide to investing' and think I have a grasp on it or at least where to look for further details.
 
One area however I'm still struggling with is in relation to taxes. I am a UK citizen who has lived/worked in Germany for many years with no plan to go back to the UK. For the last 7 years I am on assignment in a 3rd country. I submit tax forms in both countries and my tax is equalized.
 
Most investment advice is tailored towards the US and hence there are many discussions about tax sheltered accounts (IRA's) however there doesn't ever seem to be any mention for non-Americans. Is this simply due to the fact that Americans are US-taxed on non-US earnings? The rest of us are not taxed this way and therefore we don't need this type of account?
 
My understanding right now is that I could open a brokerage account with Saxo in HK (for example) and I don't pay any tax on capital gains but I DO on dividends to the country where the fund is managed. So I don't pay any tax to my home country, Germany...right?",2

The stock is so low because their biggest collaborator has pulled away from the company. They are still required to fund the clinical trials, but ONTX is hurting from this retraction. They will require additional funding or partnership to continue. Investing in this stock is a bet that this will happen - it will *have* to happen.

The question then becomes, how likely is it to occur?

Well, so far everything I've looked at has pointed to the company's lead candidate being exceptionally good. Its for people with hematological malignancies such as MDS that need blood transfusions.

The company's drug targets people who aren't responding to other therapies (Hypomethylating agents or HMAs). In a small study, 64% of patients that *DIDN'T RESPOND TO HMAs (the standard of care for them)* responded to ONTX's drug.

Additionally, ONTX's drug had a *HIGHER RESPONSE RATE* than the standard of care.

16-04-04,4da90w,$OLED Super HD porn all day niggah!,"What are your thoughts on OLED? 

Its forming a triple top so looking for a strong breakout and breakdown. Strong relative strength and momentum. 

The stock tends to follow AAPL's stock. But they have a technology that could be a dominant form of lighting and display in all sorts of items. Licensing revenue model.

Strong revenue and cash flows over past 3 years. Increasing margins. Royalties account for 40% of revenue. 

The company has over 3,500 issued and pending patents worldwide covering OLED technologies, materials and processes. 

OLED stands for organic light-emitting diode. Very simply put, an OLED is made with organic compounds that light up when fed electricity. That may not seem like a huge difference when compared to LED, but OLEDs can be made to be extremely thin, small and remarkably flexible. On an OLED TV, each pixel lights itself up independently of the others.

So when I move I'm wondering if I should stretch the budget and buy a bigger house or move somewhere a bit more modest. The obvious decision would be to go for the smaller place, smaller mortgage and lower monthly payments.

However, where it gets a bit more complicated is that house prices are shooting up at the moment. If I invested more money into a property, I would likely see larger returns. By that I mean, if property goes up on average 6%, a more expensive house would net greater returns in real terms.

16-04-04,4dd9y8,Slight Windfall and Delegation Advice,"Firstly, I apologize if this post is scatterbrained, but i'll certainly do my best.

I recently got $18,000 deposited in my savings from grandma. Based on my current figures, it's looking like i'll be at around $16,000 in subsidized loans and $8,000 in unsubsidized loans by the time i'm done with school.

Now, the question: What would be the smartest thing to do with this chunk of money in terms of delegating between saving/investing (mutual fund/IRA), and paying off current debt?

In seeking guidance, I've had Roth IRA and VTSMX thrown my way in terms of places to put this money rather than just letting it rot at 0.01% in my savings, but my concern is that it would be nearly pointless to put this money away in an account like that for 2-3 years before I will probably need it to pay off my loans.
My current thought is that I can pay off my current unsub'd loans and accrued interest ($4,170), and then possibly put the rest in that Vanguard mutual fund until I need it? (I am uneducated about this fund, and have been unsuccessful in finding out about penalties for withdrawing, and other need-to-know parameters).
Would there be a better short-term fund to use? Would it be worth it to divide the remaining money to set up an IRA, and then put the rest in some fund? Or would that be splitting the money too thin making it pointless?

Possibly better to just put all of it away in the VTSMX until im done with school?

Any guidance is appreciated, also sorry about another student loan post, but I couldn't find any other posts close enough in similarity.",5

16-04-04,4ddcp7,Keep $NVRO on watch in the coming weeks -," Nevro $NVRO is Medical Device company ( Senza spinal cord stimulation ) that IPO'd 18 months ago - product received FDA approval and superiority labeling in 2Q 2015. Nevro ($NVRO ) has beat earnings estimates and raised guidance every single quarter, and also raised guidance outside of an earnings report in January(so 7 guidance raises in 18 months).

This is one of the best growth stories i have seen - 114% top line growth in 2015 and will be 142%+ in 2016(before any more guidance raises). Also one of the few stories out there where the US is the major growth area &amp; emerging market, Nevro has been successful in Europe and Australia already.

Stock has started to move up with the sector ( ISRG and others) yet is still down 7% on the year. The kicker with NVRO is someone is betting big on downside, with the short interest nearly doubling in the past two months to 5.6 million shares which is now 22% of the floating shares.

Either one big bettor is right on growth slowing, or they are going to get fried and create a #YOLO squeeze. I hold May $70 calls @ $1.90 average and will be looking for more positions in the next few days.",24

16-04-04,4db8bv,Investing in an ESA,"Hey all,

New to investing and I have a question about putting money away for my 5 year old's college fund.

I can't really afford to sock away large chunks of money at a time. So, something I've been doing is putting monthly deposits into an ESA that I created on the Capital One Investing Site. I now have almost $500 in there, but the problem is, it's not invested, so it's just kind of sitting there not making money.

I want to know if anyone can recommend a good investment strategy for someone like me. I'll probably keep adding what I can, and then try to invest in something once I get $100-$200 in there, rat here than putting in a bunch of money at once.

I also have a Michigan 529 plan that I contribute to when I can, but I'm mostly concerned with the ESA, since I have to choose the funding source myself.

Any suggestions would be helpful.",1

16-04-04,4dcgfu,[Discussion] Which Broker is your favorite and why?,"Hello,

As the title states I was wondering who your broker of choice is and why? The reason I'm asking this questions mainly is because I want to hear your opinions on which broker you chose and why. I would like to open an investment account sometime this summer with a few grand and start actually trading stocks, but I haven't completely decided on a broker. However, I have looked at a lot of the other threads and looked around and gotten an overall consensus, but I wanted to know how you chose to day trade and why?

Currently my Top Choices would have to be Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade or Fidelity.


Also, I have a good amount of experience with stocks, although I personally haven't traded it much. I am a portfolio analyst for the Student Managed Investment Portfolio club at my school.

There is no single answer to this question, but we will also need A LOT MORE information if we are to give some sort of answer

* How old are you?
* Are you employed/making income? How much?
* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)
* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)
* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
* Any big debts?
* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.

16-04-05,4dhe72,The Panama Papers: A bullish case for decentralized financial networks.,"You probably already know about the Panama Papers: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/05/world/panama-papers-explainer.html?_r=0  
  
But if you want to make money, you need to look a few steps ahead: the concept of the off-shore bank account is going away, ladies and gentlemen.  The traditional idea of financial privacy is being demolished by cooperative governments seeking to shine light on any who would hide any part of their assets.  
  
Now I am not hawking decentralized financial networks solely as a means to store wealth privately, but the fact remains - they are very good at that, among other things.  
  
Most have become so blinded to the truth of what money is they think it *must* come from the Federal Reserve or be printed on strips of paper.  They don't realize that money is a language like any other, and thanks to new technology we are now learning to speak 'money' on a level never before possible.  
  
We have, for the first time in human history, private and untraceable money that can be sent across the planet instantly, nearly for free, and without anyone's approval whatsoever.  *This has never happened before in the history of Earth.*  I can't emphasize that enough.  It also does other things well, like enable an individual to save wealth in a way that can only be seen if the individual permits it, and allows people to make unique contracts that can't be backed out of (but also that others don't have to know about).  
  
If you are not up to speed on the latest developments in blockchain technology, you are sorely behind in the field of money.  People will use this technology for many things, and it will succeed as a result of these synergistic network effects.

TBH, I barely know what I'm doing. This will be my first time trading short term and I wanted to practice on something small and make some mistakes early on. I found some stocks that are low and are bouncing along a resistance (I better have used this word correctly) that seemed safe to bet on once they reach their low point.

This is purely for fun/practice with around $800 I have sitting in my RH account that I'd like to throw at something I speculate will rise.

I plan to sell once they rise back to a recent peak.

16-04-05,4dgjc5,[News via Barclays] Wider US trade deficit clouds Q1 growth picture further,"The nominal monthly trade deficit widened to $47.1bn in February, more than the $46.2bn we and the consensus had expected. About half of this wider-than-expected deficit was driven by a $575mn upward revision to the monthly trade deficit in goods that was first estimated in last week’s advance report. Additionally, the trade surplus in services narrowed by about $300mn in February and the total trade deficit in January was revised up $200mn to $45.9bn. On net, this morning’s report indicates a larger drag on Q1 GDP growth from net exports. 


Total exports rose 1.0% m/m in nominal terms (previous: -2.2%), driven by a 1.6% rebound in goods exports (previous: -3.4%). After adjusting for changes in export prices, real goods exports were up 2.2% on the month (previous: -2.2%). Nominal imports grew 1.3% m/m (previous: -1.3%) and goods imports increased 1.5% m/m (previous: -1.6%). Real goods imports rose sharply by 2.3% m/m (previous: -0.5%). Similar to the advance trade report last week, the rebound in trade flows was driven by food and beverages and consumer goods. Elsewhere, auto exports rose 2.8% m/m and capital goods imports increased 2.1% m/m; both of these outturns look to be consistent with some stabilization in the manufacturing sector. These changes led the real goods deficit to widen to $63.3bn in February (previous: $61.8bn), with the real nonpetroleum goods deficit driving that change ($60.2bn, previous: $58.4bn). The quarter-to-date average of the real goods deficit is now at $62.6bn, versus $60.9bn in Q4. On balance, we view the February trade results as consistent with weak growth abroad providing a headwind to US growth and domestic demand that continues to outperform globally. 


Revisions to the trade deficit in goods through February, as well as a narrower-than-expected trade surplus in services on the month, suggest a wider trade deficit in Q1. We now expect net trade to subtract 0.9pp from real GDP growth in Q1, up from 0.6pp previously. Our Q1 GDP tracking estimate fell three-tenths to 0.4% as a result.

Please add more! please add associated stocks and reasoning also:

3D printing-  A wide variety of materials have been made to be printable.  When the technology becomes quick enough for mass production... watch out.

FinTech- Financial Technology companies IMO will outperform the market.  Square, Paypal, AliPay, ApplePay, etc.  There is a lot of competition that may hurt the industry in the short run, but I have a CRAZY hypothesis that these companies may cause many regional and national banks to close.  Companies like Apple, Alibaba, and Samsung have enough free cash flow to provide credit to small business owners and individuals a like.  They take any payment method.  They provide instant access to funds and credit, they provide detailed analysis about the company, and provide excellent B2B relationships.

Green Energy- Wind and Solar especially will continue to advance.  Even with the low cost of oil, I believe that these energies are well positioned for the future.

Robotics- Robots will take over the world

Exoskeleton suits-  great technology for the handicapped, however i see the biggest growth in this segment coming from military and police outfits.

About two days ago, I shorted $HSBC. I cashed out, and frankly, I honestly have no fuckin idea what I'm doing. I'm just throwing cash around. Anyways, after cashing out on $HSBC, because it fucking plummeted and reached a new low, I'm thinking about just buying it and holding, because it has to go up in the long term, right?

16-04-05,4di8jk,"$CTLT won't release FDA Form 483 information about $OPK drug delay. Some DD about DD.","I just got off the phone with the PR guy from Catalent.

He stated that Catalent has no plan to publicly address the Form 483 observations of the St. Petersburg plant that delayed $OPK Rayaldee's approval.

I mentioned that just last year, their Morrisville plant had a Form 483 and Catalent had made a public statement about it:

http://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Contract-Manufacturing/Catalent-hit-with-FDA-Form-483-at-North-Carolina-plant

**Catalent spokesman Chris Halling told us, ""I can confirm that on March 20, 2015, following a routine inspection of Catalent’s Morrisville, NC facility, the US FDA made six 483 observations. Catalent responded by immediately effecting measures to resolve the observations. The FDA later recommended approval of the Morrisville facility for the manufacturing and testing of the products concerned.""**

He then told me [that information was released by the FDA themselves](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofGlobalRegulatoryOperationsandPolicy/ORA/ORAElectronicReadingRoom/UCM453951.pdf) and if they receive enough FOIA requests, they will make the 483 observations public.

So, if you are in $OPK or are planning to get in, this is a way to get information about the exact reasons Catalent was hit with 483 observations, and, perhaps more importantly, the severity of those observations and how long it will take to rectify them.

If it's Class 1, it's a 2-month delay. If it's Class 2, it's a 6-month delay.

Right now, only Catalent, Opko and the FDA know the answer to that.

But I'm confused about this:

With the above equation, we get

1) Monthly ARPU * Margin / LTV = Monthly Churn

2) Annual ARPU * Margin / LTV = Annual Churn

But with some substitutions, that means that Annual Churn = 12 * Monthly Churn, which is not right.

Because Annual Churn = 1- (1 - Monthly Churn)^12

16-04-06,4dje80,4 Promising Lithium Mining Companies and Evaluating Stocks in a Bull Run.,"So I've been watching a number of Lithium companies this past while and the four I've been watching have seen phenomenal gains since December.  Now I've become decent at evaluating the stability of a company regarding it's debt and cash flow and while none of these companies are ones I would endorse based on the balance sheet alone all four do have potentially lucrative projects in the works in an industry that is seeing high demand and low supply.  Any sound methods used to judge the fair price of a stock would be appreciated.  The companies themselves are ORL, LIX, LAC, and NMX.  




ORL is currently producing and is working on increasing production to break even numbers and has increased a 100% in price since December. 




 LIX is fairly new with a number of assets that need to be further explored and has seen its stock price increase 300% (almost indefinitely overvalued). 




LAC is another lithium mining play ,which I don't know a ton about, that is projecting high production and has a number of proven assets in Argentina and has seen its share price increase 100% since December.



NMX is a Canadian based company sitting on one of the largest 2P reserves in the world and is currently working on getting all the pieces in place to eventually start production.  They also have some proprietary methods for processing the product via electrolysis cutting soda ash out of the cost equation.  They also have strong support from both the federal and provincial government in Quebec which is very rare.  This is another company with share price that had went up 100% since December and in this case and 364% in the last year.

Now I honestly am not as educated as I will be if I do initiate a position on any of these stocks but the big caveat before I even consider investing is how to decide what a fair price is when these stocks have been seeing massive gains.  Trying to judge when the bull run will end is impossible so the next question to ask is how to  accurately judge where to enter when most of these stocks have very little revenue currently but still have high potential to be large parts of the lithium industry (I suppose what I'm asking is how to evaluate based on potential growth).  I hope I've made my quandary as clear as possible and any insight will be appreciated.",29

16-04-05,4dgyol,CPXX DD,"Been meaning to write a DD on CPXX but of all biopharms this motherfucker still has significant potential if you're willing to hold intermediate term. Their product vyexos is nearly a grandslam. Benefit on all parameters vs the standard of care for high risk AML. That makes this the new standard of care for a large population of patients with recurrent and high risk AML. Not a second in line cocksucker. First line, replacing the standard of care.

The success of the drug is based on improving delivery at appropriate ratios liposomally which is an otherwise difficult thing to control. The success tells me that standard chemo delivery is not optimized and that this can have an impact on solid cancers as well. Indeed it is being tested in rectal cancer and a few other cases. When someone is diagnosed with cancer they have local and metastatic disease. We often can't see the metastatic disease bc there are too few for our thresholds. But we know it is there (micrometastatic). Improvement in survival comes from killing that disease which is what chemo does, not necessarily the primary disease which is what surgery and radiation do. Survival is the key term that oncologists get a hard on for. If we can't control our ratio of chemo delivery then the chemo doesn't work as well and celator is solving that. In some ways this is the strategy that J&amp;J used with drug eluting stents. Improve what we know already works. The CEO addressed the issue of length of FDA approval by people were concerned about that given they use the same drugs. Approval will be 7 years not the 3 that critics claimed according to discussion with FDA. 

How high can the stock go? I don't know, but if it improves solid disease survival/control parameters the sky is the limit or someone will be looking hard at buying.",6

16-04-05,4dh5wh,A question about proxy voting and the mining industry.,"[The Goldcorp Challenge](http://www.infomine.com/index/pr/Pa065434.PDF) was when a Canadian gold mining company decided to upload all their proprietary geological data to the Internet for all to see. The idea was that open-sourcing the interpretation of their geological data would lead to novel theories on where to drill next. The experiment was a major success for the company and is a really interesting story.
  
The mining industry is very conservative and very secretive. Despite the success of the open source model, it has failed to take root in the industry. Perhaps the change will come from shareholders pushing for management to open source the company data? I think that if this model were implemented widely, it would cut costs dramatically in the industry, which is in the depths of a cyclical bear market.  
  
I don't know much about proxy voting, so I have to ask: could investors bundle together their votes to encourage management to open source their geological data? I know how difficult it might be to get enough shareholders to *make* management do anything, but if enough shareholders were involved, it would still send a message and give management the courage to put their necks on the line.",1

First Full Disclosure:
-Unfortunately at the time of writing this post I am not drunk.
-I semi-frequently hold positions in NBR and WLL (currently in WLL)

I'd like to start a thread about playing stocks related to the drilling and exploration of oil. In my experience these stocks are relatively secure to bankruptcy (the larger ones) and are pretty easy to buy and sell at a profit because of the volatility surrounding oil. Everyone knows that someday oil is going to go back up, it is just a matter of when. Timing as always is a big deal, but it is really really easy to log onto marketwatch and see what oil is doing on any particular day. These stocks mostly follow the trend of the price per barrel and the demand for oil.

ITT: 
-What do you know about buying and selling drilling and exploration companies?
-What sources do you use to monitor international conflict and other factors of infulence?
-Shit like that.

&gt;* Jack Lew, the United States Secretary Of The Treasury, called Pfizer’s bluff, instituting new rules to make the move as difficult as possible. The punch hit, and investors are reeling.

&gt;* “Tax avoidance is a big, global problem,” President Obama said on Tuesday, invoking the release of the Panama Papers, which revealed offshore accounts and tax avoidance schemes connected with Iceland Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson, Argentinian President Mauricio Macri, associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and others. “A lot of it is legal, but that’s exactly the problem,” Obama said.

&gt;* “When politicians perpetuate a system that favors the wealthy,” he said, “it’s not surprising that people feel they can’t get ahead. It’s not surprising that that may produce politics” where people feel frustrated.

&gt;* After Obama spoke, Hillary Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, and her rival, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, released statements applauding the Treasury action and vowing to press Congress to enact comprehensive legislation to put an end to the practice if elected. 

&gt;* Four of the US’s largest hedge funds saw as much as $900m knocked off the value of their holdings in Allergan when new tax rules helped wipe 15 per cent off the pharmaceutical group’s share price.

16-04-06,4dlqsj,The Pfizer / Allergan deal illustrates something important...,"In the last few months, I've seen this question pop up in this sub several times: ""if the share is trading less for the acquisition price, why not buy and take the profit?"" An acquisition happens, company A buys company B, and a per share price gets announced for the acquisition.

Let's say that the buyout price for B is $90 per share, and it pops to around $85 per share. Many people look at this situation and think that there's an easy $5 gap to be reaped, pending the acquisition going through.

That last part is the kicker. When acquisitions fall through, so does the share price.

Let's use Allergan as an example:

**October 2015:** AGN trading in the $250 - $280 range with quite a bit of volatility

**November 2015:** Deal announced with an acquisition price of $363, AGN pops to as high as $323

*Now at this point, I want to note that the $40 gap here between the stock price and the acquisition price is one of the widest I've seen. I think this is indicative that the smart money knew this deal wasn't likely to go through.*

**April 6, 2016:** Deal falls through. AGN just opened at $236 after being $277 at the close of business Monday.

Think of it this way: if you're buying a share that's pending being acquired, the gap between your price and the announced acquisition price represents the risk of the deal falling through. It might seem like easy arbitrage, but be careful out there.

16-04-06,4dlshq,Discussion: at what point does holding bonds become speculation?,"In Europe, we have a continuous decline in bond yields. Currently, investment grade goverment bonds owith maturities under 8 years have [negative yields](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/money/yc/html/index.en.html). 

Bonds are a vital component in a, and I would say any, portfolio. When markets panic, i.e. shit hits the proverbial fan, investors run to safe havens like government bonds, and, also not uncommonly, gold. 

It is argued that bonds, even despite low or even negative yields, are a good investment. The rationale behind this is, when markets tumble, investors sell their shares and buy bonds, and in this respect lower the yields even further into negative territory, which comes to be benefit of existing bondholders. 

I am perfectly capable of following this line of reasoning, and I do agree with it to some extent. However, it also has bit of a 'greater fool' feel. Economically speaking, for the individual investor, it makes little sense in terms of yield to buy these bonds while you can get 2% in a high yield savings account. And yes, that would cause an individual investor to miss out on a run on bonds sparked by market distress. However, would this not be quite an expensive source of insurance? Moreover, and perhaps more importantly, is buying bonds for a potential 'flight to safety' not more akin to speculation rather than investing? As you are, in essence, holding buying assets with an expected negative return, hoping that the expected negative return increases. 

I'd gladly hear your opinion on this.

16-04-05,4dj7vs,$CRZO DD,"Carrizo Oil and Gas is an independent Exploration &amp; Production company that operates in multiple basins throughout the United States. The company’s most valuable assets lie within the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford Shale where operational breakevens are relatively more attractive due to access to rich hydrocarbons at multiple levels of the acreage. The producer projects that it has at least 15 years of sustainable inventory in the Eagle Ford region alone.
  
**Trading at a Discount to Similar Producers:** Permian E&amp;Ps have become the safe haven for many investors who have re-allocated their energy exposure after the collapse in commodities. For this reason, names like CRZO have been oversold especially due to the fact that the company’s asset base in the Eagle Ford and Delaware basins are of the same quality as its Permian peers. Thus, CRZO is a strong value play that offers notable upside compared to producers with similar assets. CRZO’s marginally higher financial leverage and diversified asset base does not warrant a 7.48x (EV/EBITDA) discount when Carrizo has strong levels of liquidity and the ability to deliver reasonable levels of revenue during the downturn. However, it is worth noting that the firm’s stock has a beta of 1.81 which is higher than the peer average. On the other hand, this is reasonable for the volatile oil and gas industry and may even act as a driving force that allows CRZO to achieve comparatively higher returns during a resurgence of commodity values.
  
**Tactical Hedging and Manageable Leverage:** Carrizo Oil and Gas’ valuation has fallen about 44% since 2014 as investors have penalized the company for its higher relative leverage of 4.25x EBITDA and diversified asset portfolio. While the market may view the company’s financial leverage as a headwind, it can be an attractive opportunity to reap higher returns on a commodity price rebound. Some will argue that this may also spell lower comparative returns if prices continue to weaken, but this notion is offset by the firm’s prudent hedge book which has 60% of its production receiving prices between $50 to $70 for all of 2016 and 50% of 2017 production hedged over $50/bbl. In addition to its hedging profile, CRZO does not have any debt maturing until 2018 which provides the company with an ample time horizon to either de-leverage its balance sheet and build cash from higher commodity prices or plan to obtain additional financing in preparation for an abnormally long downturn.

**Production Cuts by the Majors &amp; Accelerating Decline Rates:** The world’s largest integrated oil companies account for about 20% of global output and have cut CAPEX guidance notably for 2016. We have yet to receive guidance on how these cuts will translate into production guidance, but a mere 5% drop in production from the top 15 producers would drastically narrow the supply and demand gap by about 0.95 mmbpd. This would almost completely eliminate the 1-1.5mmbpd supply and demand imbalance estimated by the EIA. Additionally, well decline rates alone of 5-7% for the year could magnify the amount of oil coming offline as producers scale back production and look to operate within free cash flow.
  
**NAV Valuation**
  
* Determined the total value of CRZO’s proved and undeveloped asset base by assuming that the firm will produce its reserves until they are completely exhausted and obtain cash flows based on various commodity assumptions and maintaining current cost structure
* Take the NPV of these cash flows at a 10% discount rate and add them to the prevailing value of undeveloped acreage based on historical transactions in order to obtain a total Enterprise Value ($3.52 Bn for Base Case)
* Add back Cash ($2 mm) and subtract all outstanding debt ($1.24 Bn) to obtain an Implied Equity Value ($2.28 Bn) which is divided amongst total outstanding shares (57.4 mm) for a PT of $39.78
 
*Sources: Factset, Bloomberg, not being an idiot*
  
*Disclaimer: I do not have a position in CRZO, I opened a position in late feb that I closed out after a significant rally. This DD is slightly dates, so some numbers may be slightly off, but the thesis is still valid and the numbers haven't changed dramatically.*",8

16-04-06,4dlapy,Due diligence: $TGT,"I ended up just feeling in the mood to look through some 10-K's so here we go:

1. Target is experiencing a decrease in earnings by 12.14% over the last five years, yet the share price is up almost 65% in the same period (though it has leveled off over the past 1.5 years)

2. COGS rose by $419m from 2013 to 2014 which, along with their advertising budget growing by $16m last year, could indicate executive action taken to increase customer-base

3. Value of unsold inventory (regardless of quantity) rose by 16% ($512m) last year while cash assets rose by 329% ($670m to $2.21b). There has also been a steady (P-value of 0.08) decrease in the balance of several high-IR liabilities accounts, but the past two years saw a 32% increase (both years) in try to pay these off; they may be paying off debt while they have the cash on hand in preparation for an expected drop in sales.

4. The delta yearly-average share price grew at a slope of 1.02x but fell in 2012 with a slope of 1.19x

Other: Target is in a prime position for a partnership (think $ALK and $VA) and I wouldn't be surprised if such talks with a store like BB&amp;B or Best Buy occurred in the coming months. I plan on long-shorting once it climbs back up above $83 for around 15 and look to sell once it bottoms at $50. What do y'all think?",11

Divorce can take a toll, do you think this will this affect his mind or ability to lead TSLA? As noted in the article:

""In a Harvard Business School report on the impact of CEO divorces on shareholders, the authors point out that a divorce could impact a company in three ways:

1. Loss of control or influence: ""A CEO with a significant ownership stake in a company might be forced to sell or transfer a portion of this stake to satisfy the terms of a divorce settlement.""

2. ""Divorce can affect the productivity, concentration, and energy levels of the CEO.""

3. ""Divorce can influence a CEO's attitude toward risk, depending on how the divorce settlement is financed.""

Also in the article:
&gt;""This is a California divorce,"" says attorney Robert Stephan Cohen, whom the New York Times dubbed ""one of the most powerful matrimonial lawyers in the country."" ""They have community property in California, which means all the money that was made during the marriage and the appreciation of property he already had"" is shared between the couple.",9

Sorry to burst your bubble. Most of my diabetic patients are more interested in painless monitoring methods over administration. Administration needles for the most part are so finely gauged they are painless. The digital lances are the inconvenience. Most all of my diabetic patients that fall out of compliance do so for pain of the finger stick, yet the same people comment how their pen is relatively painless. 

Also, new medications have a very difficult time making a name for themselves. Especially due to cost disparity when they drop into the market with tons of R&amp;D and marketing overhead. Now imagine an insurance company willing to cover a more expensive reinvention of the wheel. Sorry, even my nurse aids could tell you that. Keep your money and speculation in sectors you know and understand intimately.

Edit: my reply below to bonerdetective has been censored as my colleague states he can only see the patent comment.. mod conspiracy?

It's a poor product. I'm sorry if you've sunk your teeth into it. Maybe it will succeed when insulin pumps are cheap and ubiquitous. Even until then it will be 10 years until an affordable generic market opens up. It will face problems with improper inhalation use. (We still can't get our respiratory population to use their steroid/adrenergic inhalers correctly).  I'm sure it will have absorption maladies with inflammatory conditions, lung volumes, and mucosal variations just as we see with inhaled versions of fentanyl and nalaxone. Even if these factors can somehow be corrected by the time the product goes to an affordable generic, pancreatic stem cell therapy will most likely be center stage. I really don't care what your local investment physician, or wealthy sponsored study participants say about the drug. As an investment opportunity it's terrible.  I'm not insulting your intelligence. I just don't understand your personal emotional endowments against my rational explanation as to why this drug will fail. Lots of miracle drugs and good ideas have mysteriously failed in big pharma. The only way I'm putting money in biotech is with bona fide inside trading information. Also, I never claimed to be a physician. I know many physicians who are complete idiots, and many who sold themselves short by becoming one. I'm just trying to put this out there to save people money and trouble. I'm not trying to attack the ones who bit. So here's where I turn the other cheek. Best of luck.

So I am saving up to put a deposit down on a house. I dont have much right now in Liquid assets (£9k in savings, 1k in shares). I also get the Armed Forces Help to Buy scheme.

Realistically, I dont think I will actually be in a position to purchase a property until December, and the interest i make in my measly savings is hardly worth the effort.

So I was thinking about Premium Bonds. Yes, there is a slim chance of a massive return, but I am dealing with such small amounts that interest earnings aren't going to be significant and it will be for a long enough period of time that my chances of winning something may make it worthwhile without inflation eroding it all.

What do you guys think?

16-04-07,4doopp,An Open Letter from a PutleGroup Employee,"Finding Value in PulteGroup


PulteGroup Employee
Home Office
Atlanta, GA

April 6,  2016

Mr. Bill Pulte and PulteGroup board of directors: 

The events of the last few days have been tolling on my colleagues and I. The media frenzy and lack of internal communication has been exasperating. While the value of what a lower level employee has to say may not bear much weight, perhaps I have your attention.

On my first day of working for PulteGroup, I received a book entitled “Building a Legacy, The Bill Pulte Story”. As I learned the history and core values of the company, I found myself grateful to have found an amazing company with such vision: Faith, Family, and the Pulte Family were the values that the company was built on. In my own life I value God, my family, and the community before myself so I was ecstatic to find such a culture.

As I continued through the training program, I became confused as to what the values of the company actually were. I was presented with what the company calls “critical priorities” that seem to have replaced the original values of the company as a part of this value creation strategy. The four priorities are: Consumer Focus, Capital Productivity, Operating Margin and an Engaged Culture. 

When seeking information regarding where we are excelling versus mediocre, I was surprised at where we stand. I can see clearly now that we, as a company, have been focusing on short term profits while sacrificing the legacy that our homes were meant to build. Our focus has been creating individual wealth and value for our current executives instead of creating a lasting product for the consumer and valuing the current employees.

When I first saw “Engaged Culture” on the critical priorities I imagined this to be a synonym to “Pulte Family”. However, when looking on the company's website under “Engaged Culture” I found charities and the “Built to Honor” program. This led me to think that “Engaged Culture” might be equivalent “Faith”. What I have learned from working at this company is that charitable giving appears to be less of a desire to give and more of a public relations and marketing minded decision. I have to believe that even if you do not have a specific faith, the definition of “good faith” should still be adhered to in a value based company. This “good faith” is honesty and a sincere intention to deal fairly with others. 

The company has been working on product development as a way of being “Consumer Inspired”, another variation of the critical priority “Consumer Focused”. Unfortunately, there are many consumer complaints online that are concerning to say the least. In September 2015, a consumer stated “Please beware as your financial plans can be destroyed by these greedy creatures”. In December 2015 it was said that a “consumer relations person told me flat out that corporate WILL NOT get involved”. In February of this year, one consumer said “It’s upsetting they needed bad publicity to properly act on their failed management” in regards to an incident where their new home was trashed with alcohol bottles and vomit prior to their arrival. The same month an 81 year old disabled woman was said to have been “charged obscene daily rates” as she struggled to get money from her trust. An internal email from the CEO revealed lack of ownership regarding publicized complaints from consumers. It was indicated that PulteGroup was not to blame when writing: “with just a few minutes of work an unhappy homeowner or supportive attorney can splash negative comments across one or multiple social channels.  Then, for a few hundred dollars, they can market their site to our consumers, our investors and our employees.” We as a company are failing our consumers. Have we become so immersed into corporate America that the lives and families of a few hundred people means so little?

Glenn Llopis wrote in his contribution to Forbes that in order to have a great family culture at work there must be a “sense of ownership”, you must “lead with kindness and intention” and “instill values to enable a trusted culture”. There are culture inspiring things that are provided at home office such as bagels and doughnuts on Friday mornings and birthday celebrations. Employees still lack trust in their employer due to several major reasons. First, it is difficult to trust someone who uses company-wide emails to support personal endeavors and to instill confusion and fear to their employees. Second, realizing that everyone in their position gets paid according to what they asked for upon hire, causes devaluing and contention amongst employees. While a difference in pay according to merit or prior experience would be understandable or even admirable, the company places little value on many of my colleagues’ experience outside of PulteGroup. The result of this is disgruntled employees with an average turnover rate of almost 25%. Lastly, employees feel devalued when working overtime and are asked to leave through the back entrance due to the CEO having a private event on the terrace.

I urge the Pulte family as the majority shareholder and the members of the board to return to the core values that this company flourished under for so long. Please do not leave dissension and the pressure to take sides amongst your employees. Do not leave us wondering if we need to find new jobs. I am petitioning you to end this war so that the company can rise from the ashes stronger than before.


Sincerely,

A humble PulteGroup Employee.

""I’d be a little wary, too, if the information Yahoo has been doling out continues, which it signaled in its recent results. In one slide showing expected results from 2016, Yahoo is estimating that revenue is dropping close to 15 percent and earnings by over 20 percent. Those revenues, backing out traffic acquisition costs (TAC), are expected to decline from $4.4 billion in 2014 and $4.1 billion in 2015 — already down from previous years — to $3.5 billion in 2016; meanwhile, earnings before depreciation, taxes and amortization are moving from $1.4 billion in 2014 and just below $1 billion in 2015 to $750 million in 2016.""

16-04-06,4dnjnk,AMRN DD,"After reading the MNKD post, I decided to write a post for AMRN.  
  
**Amarin:**  A biopharmaceutical company focused on the commercialization and development of therapeutics to improve cardiovascular health.  
  
**Product:** [Vascepa](http://www.vascepa.com/) - An ultra-pure, EPA-only omega-3 fatty acid product available by prescription. Amarin has completed two phase 3 studies; 60% done with their third study (Reduce-IT). Vascepa is already a FDA approved drug.  
  

**Potential:** Reduce-IT study is currently ongoing. This is a massive 7,900 patient study which tests the effectiveness of Vascepa combined with statins. There is an interim look, where the study can be stopped due to overwhelming efficacy. If the study is not stopped at Interim, the study will continue until 2017, with a readout in early 2018. [The company just announced the completion of enrollment for the study and that the 60%/967th event has occurred.](http://investor.amarincorp.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=962859) They estimate that it will take 6 months for the DMC to gather and review the data. So sometime before September.  
  
**From the last CC:**  “We reiterate that we anticipate 2016 revenue of between $105 million and $120 million. We believe that our revenue growth together with our continued commitment to controlling expenses, will result in our commercial operations entering 2017 cash flow positive, excluding R&amp;D costs which are mostly related to REDUCE-IT.”  

“We envision Vascepa as being the ideal add-on therapy to statin, especially with its favorable safety profile and believe that is an opportunity that should be measured in billions of dollars.”  
  
**Recent events:**  
[Amarin and FDA have settled a 1st Amendment Litigation. Amarin is able to promote truthful information off-label.](http://investor.amarincorp.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=959511) This is starting to show an increase in weekly prescription numbers.  
[Last summer, Amarin won a suit against FDA for exclusivity. The judge ordered FDA to recognize five-year, NCE marketing exclusivity.](http://investor.amarincorp.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=915375) On top of this NCE exclusivity, Amarin also holds a [shit ton of tested patents.](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/docs/patexclnew.cfm?Appl_No=202057&amp;Product_No=001&amp;table1=OB_Rx)


**Things to note:** 
Company has $107 million on hand (as reported at the last CC), if Reduce-It is not stopped at Interim It is likely they will need to find a partner or dilute. 
There are not a ton of trials done with drugs that are already approved, which is why I have a good feeling about the Interim results. This being said… I am long until the study is completed.

**Conclusion:** Reduce-IT is the Holy Grail. I personally believe there will be a major run-up as we get closer to September. Major meaning over 100% increase in current share price before announcement of interim results. With a successful R-IT, this stock will easily be in the double digits.

When I rolled it over, I opened a Roth and a 401K rollover account at Vanguard. I must have gave them the wrong account number because they transferred all $15,000 into the Roth instead of into split accounts.

What are my options? Paying taxes on the $11k? Would that affect 2015 or 2016 taxes?

Vanguard also said I could do a recharacterization. Is there any downside to doing this, besides apparently having to amend my 2015 tax return?

16-04-07,4dpe6k,[DD] DD - DuPont,"here's my DD on DD.

DD (aka DuPont) is some company that's been around for a long time and is probably a great long term hold. I say this because it's ticker is $DD, so my analysis is that other people probably have done a lot of DD on DD because the name simply implies due diligence, and it should remind investors to do due diligence on the stock before investing in it.


If you went to a place called 'big burger' you'd expect a big burger, right? So if you invest in DD, you can expect that due diligence has already been done, thus it's a great long term hold that probably wont fuck you. I realize this is probably better suited for /r/investing, but I can add some spice to my post and tell people do buy long term calls because as time goes on, companies get bigger and as we all know bigger company= higher share price.

To make matters worse, it doesn't even look like I can buy any share/fund listed on Japanese exchanges, just the ones they white list. I thought it might be because there are restrictions on what you can put in a NISA account, but that stuff doesn't seem to be available even outside of it.

So I will like to hear what do you think about binary options, I can tell you not that I'm working I don't have time to play poker, because I'm a tournament player – and a tournament is taking about an hour (those that I like to play) , so in binary options I just enter a site check newspapers and  economic calendar and writing some options, in the morning I check how it did.

16-04-07,4dsxl5,Where and how to invest 500k,"Hello,
Sorry this is a throwaway account as I'm sharing my entire life's financial summary and don't want it to be tied back to me. So this is not your typical what to do with money question? In the sense, I already have several investments but I'm wondering what to do with a surplus deposit. Let me explain.

- I'm in my early 40s in fairly good health. Wife is a stay at home mom. I also have a steady job that pays me about 250k in salary and bonus. I live in CA to give some context.

- I have real estate in CA (primary home and rental properties have about 2.5 million in equity). I get about 6K every month in net rental income after all expenses (mortgage, property taxes, etc). 

I have about 1.5 million in California tax free muni ETfs which are about 15% up since I bought them. I get about 6% tax free dividend on that which I reinvest in the same ETFs. I'm happy with this portfolio and have no plans to move it around because I don't have much downward risk and the 6% tax free yield is all I care about (about 7k to 8k in after tax money). I don't worry about the ups and downs and with the recent uptick, I have about 15% buffer  before I worry so this stays.

I have another 700k in 401k that I invested in taxable munis that are yielding me about 8%. Again, I'm reinvesting the dividends and the current price is about 10% more than what I paid on an average. Don't want to dump this either. I get about 4k in dividends and I add another 3.7k every month from my 401k deductions and company match. So that's another ~8k before tax money every month into 401k going in.


Now I'm getting about 500k from a property sale (which isn't included in the real estate above to keep matters simple) after taxes. I would like to invest this money into some stocks but I'm worried that I may be entering the market at a wrong time and I may just be throwing the money down the pipe. Now I'm not worried about dollar cost averaging investments like the dividend reinvestments I'm doing in my brokerage account and 401k account. But I'm worried about this 500k investing since it is lumpsum. My own expectation is the market is at its peak or near it so I may have only one way to go - down.
- I have a certified financial planner (for fee) that is rated extremely well on Yelp. I'm not following his advice on this, which is to diversify the two main accounts (brokerage and 401k). I may revisit his advice at a later time but for now, I'm comfortable with the concentration and feel there is enough buffer if things start going down. 

With the above context, here are my questions.

- where should I invest this 500k money in?
- if growth is my objective (since I can take some risk with this money) but I think the market is at peak, what would you suggest in my portfolio? 

- I'm open to invest into stocks slowly over a period of time (one to two years) gradually (say, 10k to 15k every month) but want to find some other investment to hold the money that can generate decent returns with limited downside (say 3 to 5% is fine).

Sorry for the random structure of giving the context and asking questions. Will try to edit based on questions if there is any confusion. Thanks a lot for reading through this and willing to help.",0

16-04-07,4drwgv,"Why I believe Warren Buffet is a big ole' hypocrite","I'll make this short and sweet, as I'm positive I'll be downvoted into oblivion. Also, will preface by saying I vote conservative.

Warren Buffet is an advocate for higher taxation on cap gains. He is seen as a selfless visionary by the masses for speaking out against the ultra wealthy(himself) and condemning Congress for protecting them. To the naked eye, this is an incredibly noble thing. To me, it's hilariously hypocritical.

The first documented time I found Warren Buffet speaking out against lower tax rates for the wealthy was in 2007. He was 77 years old and worth 52B at the time(source for age Wikipedia, source for wealth 2007 Forbes). By most standards, he was considered extremely senior in his age, therefore he was looking towards his legacy. I believe it was also around that time that he pledged his fortune to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Why is it hypocritical? To speak out with conviction against policy that you have benefited from for the better part of 60 years is tremendously devious in my opinion. If he had come out in the 70's, 80's, or even 90's I would have respected the opinion and called it genuine.

16-04-08,4dvgrb,"Advice please: Age 27, 15k Inheritance, no IRA option","Hi everyone! Long time lurker, first time poster looking for advice. 

I am inheriting 15k and I assume the best thing to do normally would be to try and annually stash 5.5k of it away in a Roth IRA, however I can't do that.   Long story short, due to teaching English abroad and living in Europe, I haven't filed a tax return in the US since I was a teenager.  And It's my understanding that earned income is essential for opening up a IRA.  So I think I am stuck with only being able to open up a taxable account, at the moment, is that right? .... Unless I go down to Panama that is... haha

Also, I plan on returning to the US this year to start my 'adult' career in the states, so some of this money may find it's way being eventually put into a IRA in a few years or it could maybe go to a house deposit at some point in the ~5 year range.  Who knows.  Here is my plan at the moment and I was hoping I could get some feedback :)

Option 1: 
Open up a taxable account with Vanguard and essentially mimic the target retirement 2055 fund with 13k out of the 15k. I like having the opportunity to rebalance or tweak it a bit. 

I enjoy having a mildly active role in my finances.  That is also why I'd like to take the other 2k and add it to my ScottTrade account for midterm investing &amp; stock trading purposes.  I already have ~3.5k there invested in some stocks I've picked out.  The idea is that Vanguard would be my retirement account where my IRA will eventually also be housed and ScottTrade would be my more ""fun"" active investment portfolio for midterm investments and maybe even some actual stock trading and shorting later on. 

Option 2: Ignore the target retirement fund and pick out 3-4 other index funds or etfs from Vanguard, e.g., VOO, and invest in those with ~75% of the money and use the rest for a CD / bond ladder and / or funding my side investing account as described in the paragraph directly above.

Option 3:  I am missing a huge opportunity elsewhere that I can't see and should do something different.

1) Looking at past trends (over 5 years), each year has seen one big up trend and one big down trend.  Right now they seem to be hitting their downtrend of the year around $2.90.

2) They hit a high last year I believe when announcing the development of a drug called Plecanatide.  Now it is currently undergoing FDA approval after three stages of development.

This enough has me wondering... but I want to see if anyone else is following this or has any other insight as to whether this is a decent position or not.  I am not an experienced trader by any means but I have been on the lookout for a nice position for a few months now.

Either way it seems to be the beginning of a general uptrend (albeit not very volatile...).

Currently I am waiting for the price to get down to about $2.80 before entry.  This seems to be the floor for this stock and has been for years, so either way I see that as a token in the risk management area.  



*edit*  I should mention that in my head this strategy should be played a little long over a few months, and my initial investment will at least double in value.  After all, it really is banking on FDA approval.",19

16-04-08,4dvqyx,Would love feedback from /r/investing on a private investment fund.,"Hello /r/investing, 

**Edit: I also wanted to add before you go any further - this is NOT a solicit for anyone's money here, at all. I am simply trying to receive some feedback on my idea for future conversations. Please don't think that is why I am here.**

First of all - thank you for taking the time to read my post. What I am hoping to accomplish by posting my idea here is to receive some feedback/constructive criticism or skepticism to help me better prepare answers as I begin trying to raise money to open a private investment fund. 

I have for the better part of 3 years spent my time in the bitcoin/alternate coin world researching, investing and day trading coins for the goal of capital appreciation. Over those 3 years I've had success and have also helped some family and friends be successful as well. For some time now I have wanted to take what I would call a skill (which is investing in digital currencies) and turn it into a true business - which would be opening a private investment fund. 

What I am trying to avoid is turning this post into a 5 page story (although it will probably end up being a good page or so) but I want to try and provide as much information as possible, without rambling too much - to say I would be saying to potential investors. 

Now I myself have a background in finance. My dad, who just retired was a stock broker for 39 years. He got me into stocks at a young age. I got my series 7, series 66, worked at one of the big 4 wirehouses for awhile after college, which is what actually introduced me to bitcoin in early 2013. As someone who also has a strong tech background, as soon as I read up on bitcoin - I was hooked. Really I have been more passionate about bitcoin for the last 3 years than anything else I've ever worked on. I've spoken at large events on the subject, smaller investment clubs, met with the Secretary of State (in my home state) to discuss the topic - really it's the first thing I read in the morning and the last thing I read before I go to bed. Most people can tell by my body language as soon as I get going on the subject - it's something that I'm truly passionate about. 

So you get the picture - I'm really into bitcoin. But as much as I love the technology, I've equally enjoyed learning how the investing/trading markets function in this micro-economic system and that is where I spend most of my time during the day. After spending all this time reading, researching, learning, understanding - I've become quite good at trading this market. Like anyone I don't always make the prefect moves but I certainly make more good moves than bad. So while nothing is guaranteed I at least feel confident enough to sell myself as a skilled trader in this market. 

Right now the entire ""digital currency"" market is still pretty small - about $8 billion market cap in all. That's the size of a large mid cap stock or boarder line a small large cap stock - so not a large market at all. Daily volume fluctuates but it hangs around $75 million on an average day so you can be trading a decent amount of cash and still have liquidity. The markets are extremely volatile, I often say it's on par with trading derivatives. When you're right - you're right big and when you're wrong - you're wrong big. 

I use a mix of both fundamental and technical analysis. You might be asking yourself what the hell fundamentals do you use on bitcoin and alternate coins? Well unlike a stock that would have earnings, cash/dept ratio, PEG, the management team, etc. these coins have things strategic partnerships, development progression, the development team, the marketing team. There are a lot of different ""fundamentals"" if you will that you can use to predict market movement. The TA side is the same as any other asset class and while I use my fundamentals to pick and choose which coins to invest in, I use TA to dictate when to buy &amp; sell. Overall it's seem to be a good strategy - it has at least worked for me. 

So what I am looking for? Well because this is a fairly small market, I'm not looking for a large amount of cash. Ideally I'm planning to raise between $1-2 million to open the fund and the fund itself would have a 1% management fee with a 20% incentive fee on profits. There would not be any lock-up period, however investors would have a 15 day holding period prior to liquidation. This fund is clearly a speculative investment with the goal of higher than normal returns. 

I will stop there for now, if you're still with me I greatly appreciate you taking the time to read this all regardless of if you leave a comment or not. I would however appreciate any/all feedback even if it's just pure skepticism and you want to tell me it's a stupid idea. Thank you.

16-04-07,4dtnuo,$CTLT replied to my question about their FDA 483 observations that delayed $OPK Rayaldee approval.,"I emailed their PR guy directly and an exec replied. While not willing to tell me details, he was kind enough to take time to reply.

In short, here is the summary of the response:

- Form 483 observations are considered routine and they are not concerned by the ones found at the St. Petersburg plant

- They still expect to respond to the FDA by April 15

- (this is the part that sucks) They, nor the FDA, will publish the original Form 483 observations. The only way to get this is to request it directly from the FDA as part of the FOIA.

So, I imagine Opko already knows the answers, but Catalent nor the FDA will disclose the information short of an official FOIA request (which I've already done).

The bad news is, we don't know if it's a Class 1 or Class 2 response. Class 1 is up to 2 months. Class 2 is up to 6 months.

Opko expects a Class 1 and is still preparing to launch Rayaldee in Q2. Of course, they also expected to get approved on the first attempt, and that didn't happen.

The good news is Catalent is a multi-billion dollar company and has the resources to address these observations quickly. They had a 483 at their Morrisville plant last year and they addressed all the 483 observations in 4 months.

Without knowing the number or severity of the observations at the St. Petersburg plant, it's impossible to estimate how long it will take to rectify.

When/if I get a response to my FOIA request I will post here.

16-04-08,4dvwcm,Sourcing Investment Ideas: Supply Chain Map,"This is a personal favorite of mine since it's easy, it's obvious, yet nobody takes the time to really do it. Along with a colleague, we've become enamored with our own version of what we call ""vertical stripping,"" the process of simply mapping out, in as much detail as possible, the value chain of an industry from the most basic supplier to the end user, in order to identify all the companies along the way, with the objective of - in the case of looking for long investments - finding where all the margin is going.

Our favorite example is the airline industry: it's been around forever yet is known as being a terribly competitive and unreliable business... despite the fact that we continue to pay higher and higher airfare for basically the exact same service! So where's all the margin going? [If I could upload a picture of a napkin drawing, this would be the place I do it] Well, at the top there's the aircraft OEMs (BA, EADSY) operating a duopoly, and even above them the engine manufacturers who are highly consolidated with only 3 major players (GE, UTX, RR) and a duopoly above that in investment castings (AA, PCP). Most of these businesses earn very strong returns on capital, and we've already found a decent number of advantaged businesses worth learning about. Moving below the plane makers we have to start thinking about how aircraft are bought and placed among the airlines. Are there wholesalers, brokers, or what? Well there actually is something similar to a wholesaler... another strange business that doesn't get a whole lot of attention - aircraft leasing (AL, FLY, AER).

Moving on... Once the airlines actually have the planes, there's other ancillary businesses to consider - things like fueling (INT) and even infotainment (WIFI). You could spend a lot of time mapping out ancillaries, but in terms of major rungs on the ladder, the next one down would be the distribution network through which customers find their desired routes and make a purchase. This includes travel agencies, particularly online (EXPE, OWW), and the intermediaries between the TAs and airlines: the relatively obscure Global Distribution Systems (AMADY, Travelport). These businesses have absurd returns on capital and until recently, free cash yields in the mid-teens. At the travel agency level we can finish the exercise by including some ancillary businesses surrounding the actual reasons for travel, including hotel accommodation vendors (PCLN) and review sites (TRIP), not to mention things like rental cars (HTZ, CAR) and the actual hotels themselves (HOT, MAR). I bet a portfolio of all these tickers would look pretty impressive over the past 5 years, but hindsight is 20/20.",34

If we get 7%, aren't people underpricing stock, in other words, the average ""time value of money"" to investors is a 7% per year discount?","I really hope I conveyed my thought correctly in that title.

Clarifications:
I am proposing the time value of money is 7% (or the average return of the S&amp;P, to be exact), when affected by the risk and volitility of stocks. For a less risky less volatile asset like a tresury bond assume the time value of money is much lower, because people are more assured it will keep it's value.

I'm proposing that the profitability of companies has little to do with long term S&amp;P return, because profits are estimated and priced into what you're charged for stocks from the beginning, yet it's historically shown that stocks are ""underpriced"" around 7% per year because the average investor gets that return. I am proposing the 7% average return is not due to average company profits, but due to human lifespans and psychological reasons. People value money now more than they value money put at risk in a zero-sum game a year from now. That discount being equal to the average S&amp;P return.

16-04-08,4dw3p9,Transition to the Capital Class with ETFs,"**Why save &amp; invest?**

Saving and investing are important. I have said this before, and I will say it again. There are two classes in society, labour and capital. Unless you are a creditor or owner of a company, you are in the labour class. Means your wealth depends solely on the result of your time invested at work.

Saving and investing in bonds (creditor) and equity (shareholder), puts you in the capital class. This transition between labour class to capital class is probably more important to us, now than ever, since the gap between both classes are widening at a quick pace, (read: Thomas Piketty) and its expected to worsen.
**
Basics of Buying ETFs**

Its painfully simple. Exchange traded funds should be in your saving portfolio, because it’s easy to manage, provides instant diversification, and is difficult to screw up.

**What are ETFs?**

ETF is a big shopping bag of financial stuffs. The stuff in question can be stocks/bonds/derivatives/other ETFs. Anything with a cash flow and is actively traded in the financial markets can be put in this shopping bag. ETFs usually follow some pre-defined rules in terms of what to put in that bag. It could be stocks only from Russia (RSX), or only gold mining firms (GDX), or only bonds (MINT) etc. The funky letters in the parenthesis tells you the identifying ticker name for these ETFs, in case you are interested in doing some homework before investing. Google the tickers + etf. ETFdb is an ok website to use.


**Investment motive**

The first thing I would do is to examine my motives for investing. Are you investing because you want to finance a home in 10 years, or build a retirement nest egg? Maybe even just to try it out and find out why everyone is talking about it. Or perhaps you want to have the thrill of making money speculatively, in pyjamas on a Wednesday afternoon, scratching your balls in your chair? Whatever your motive could be, I shall show you in this article how ETFs can help you achieve your goals and not burn half your money, unlike your divorce.

**Financing big purchases**

First, I would set a target date, for when the expected withdrawal needs to happen. Then I would go make myself a cup of tea, because we are in this for the long game. Might as well take a chill pill. Usually, depending on the target date in mind, its good to start off aggressive and slowly tone it down as we get closer to the target date.

**Retirement income**

Well, you need a target date again, which will be your target retirement date. As you draw closer to the target date, keep to less volatile holdings and go into capital preservation mode. Its OK to lose half your money when you are 27, not so cool to lose half your money when you’re 72.

You know that jumpy financial advisor in that ugly glazed double-breasted gray suit, calling you every other week to recommend you some top-of-the-line investment product when you are in your golden years. Ignore him. He does not have your well-being at heart, he only cares about the commission he will earn from you. Don’t make any exotic, opaque, risky investments in your silver and golden years. If necessary, take the money out from a trading account, and in to a savings or fixed deposit account.

**Trying it out**

ETFs are the best for beginners. It’s really hard to lose all your money with ETFs. If you follow the rules below, you’d be fine.

**Speculation**

ETFs are not for you. Stop reading and go to the casino.

**Risk appetite**

Asking for your risk appetite is a polite way for those pesky financial advisors to ask you, “how much money can you lose before you shit your pants?”. The problem is, those guys asking you the questions don’t manage your money, and those guys managing your money have no clue who you are. The slimy guys at your banks probably direct your money to one of the low cost ETFs, and pocket the difference in commission anyway. Some banks charge a lot for fees, to do something so simple! Investing through your bank increases the risks too, since usually there are two counterparties instead of one. Investing is not rocket science, you can do it yourself. If you want to pay someone to do it, get an actively managed ETF then.

If you hate taking risks, that’s fine. Me too. Nothing wrong. All the better. Start constructing a portfolio with a conservative philosophy. If you are a risk taker, that’s fine too. It’s entirely up to you if you choose not to rubber up, when things get hot and heavy with the person you just met at the swingers’ club. Same for how you build a portfolio. At the end of the day, build a portfolio that doesn’t keep you up at night.
Remember, we are in for the long game, ain’t nobody gonna be checking the portfolio every 5 minutes. The whole point of investing is to put the money to work, while you work too. Its counter-productive if you have to manage your portfolio and a job. That’s why we define a time-frame, philosophy, strategy and stick to it.

**Rules**

There are some rules that are good to follow, since we’re talking about your hard-earned money.

**Expense ratios and sales charges**

Keep these as low as you can. Expense ratio is the cost to YOU for owning the ETF. There is strong correlation between low gross expense charges and good long term performance. Most big ETFs from Vanguard &amp; Blackrock have an expense ratio below 0.3%. That means you get charged $30 for every $10,000 invested. Pretty reasonable. Anything more than 0.99% is too much, in my opinion.

Some good looking sales bro will call you ever so often and tout that his firm has unlocked the secret to long lasting excess alpha returns, through smart beta, and adhering to some modified, multifactorial index, yada yada yada. The first question you have to ask him is how did he get your phone number. The second is can you take me off your phone list. And lastly, what’s the expense ratio? These are 3 questions which he will try his best to avoid answering.

**Volume**

Buy ETFs that are traded. Volume should be 6 digits. Anything less, you’re asking for liquidity troubles. Imagine when the shit hits the fan and you can’t sell your stuff or when you are making sick bucks and you can’t sell your stuff.
A good indicator is to glance at the trading volume column. Be sure to check it during trading hours. Another less reliable method is to check the assets under management (AUM). Anything with more than $1 billion is usually traded frequently.

**Diversify, diversify, diversify**

This is so important, it has to be said thrice. Your risk appetite will define the way you diversify. You ought to diversify over the following: asset type, geography, size, equity type.

**Asset type**

There are ETF for bonds, equities, commodities, derivatives, other ETFs.
If you are conservative, put 60–70% of your money in bond ETFs, and the rest in anything that catches your eye; as long as you follow the rules. If you are aggressive, put 60–70% of your money in equities ETFs, and the rest preferably in some bonds ETF; rules apply too. Any allocation in between conservative and aggressive are acceptable too. If you’re interested, go google Asset Allocation

**Bonds**

Buying bonds makes you a lender. The borrower is up to you to choose from, it could be a government, a municipality or corporates. Its healthy to have a good mix between the different entities you lend to. You can only lose what you put in.

Bonds are safer than equities simply because there is less uncertainty in cash flows. The bonds dictate how much has to be paid out, and the borrowers usually repay it. 

Especially for governments, since governments usually prefer to print money to repay the bonds than to default and be blocked off the capital markets (Argentine-style!). Do take note that interest rates and exchange rates will affect the valuation of your bonds and cash flow. However, if you cast your net wide enough, and have a long enough investment horizon, there is nothing much to worry about.

I recommend governmental bonds and corporate grade bonds. Municipal bonds are tricky. Town councils like to default. Municipal governments can’t print money too. I avoid them.

There are different classes of government bonds. Usually they are split between developed economies (AGG, BND) and developing economies (EMB). BND for example, holds 17,301 different bonds in 1 basket. That is more than enough diversification. EMB top 10 holdings includes lending money to Russia, Argentina, Hungary, Poland, Peru, Uruguay. Since holding emerging economies bonds are more dicey than developed markets, they pay more to you for interest. Another cool thing about owning bonds is that you can go to their citizens and say, your country owes me money. Absolutely true!

**Bonds Duration**

Bonds are separated through the duration. As usual, when in doubt, diversify through the distinctions. Google “Bond duration” if interested.

**Equities**

Means you are a part owner of the company. You can earn money in 2 ways, the value of your stock goes up, or they send money to you in the mail (dividends). Again, you can only lose what you put in. Taxes apply.

**Geography**

You want to spread out your purchases across continents and nations. This insulates you from country-specific events. A good rule of thumb is not to have more than 40% of your portfolio based in one continent. North America is an exception.

Remember to diversify based on your needs. For example, if your primary residence is in the US, your job pays in USD, and your job is based in USA, then you have more than enough exposure to the United States of America. It would be very pointless in the view of diversification, to invest your savings in Singapore. I act on this. My portfolio has no positions in my employing company, nor in the country where my livelihood is based on.
If you are aggressive, go for emerging markets (VWO, EEM, IEMG) and frontier markets (FRN) ETF. These usually experience more volatility. Meaning that the value of your portfolio jumps around a lot, and there is a stronger chance for higher returns.
If conservative, go for the developed markets like North America (VTI, SCHB) and Developed Europe (VGK).

The mentioned VTI and SCHB have 3723 and 2054 holdings respectively. Meaning to say that by buying VTI, you are purchasing 3723 companies in 1 go. This is recommended because you have instant diversification. Assuming equal weights, if 30 companies go bankrupt, you would have lost less than 1% of your money invested in VTI. Its much better than buying individual stocks. Take note that VTI and SCHB both have very low expense ratios too. You pay $3 for every $10,000 invested, and you gain from such diversification.

**Size**

Equities come in more or less three sizes. Large cap, mid cap, small cap. Cap is capitalization, not the thing that cool kids buy to hide their freckled, stunted foreheads. Conservative investors should stick to large cap. Large companies usually have everything in order, have strong market share, good cash flow, and make money in general. There are less surprises with these boys. The more aggressive you are, the more you should include mid and small cap in your portfolio. Note that in a recession, smaller cap companies suffer a lot. Smaller cap companies also experience great jumps and drops in prices.

**Equity type**

Other than by size, equities are also split by type: Value, Core, Growth. It’s good to diversify across the 3 types as well, and I feel it’s OK to have a preference if one wishes.

**Value** are stocks that are comparably cheap, considering their earnings. This can be due to their industry, which has little growth prospects, or perhaps the company is domiciled in a country with short-term turmoil, hence a lower price due to the uncertainty.

**Core** stocks are the backbones of the economy, whose stocks are a best representation of the domestic economy. These are usually well known companies and have a strong brand value. IVV which represents the core of the US economy, includes Apple, Microsoft, Exxon, J&amp;J, GE, Berkshire Hathaway, Facebook, Amazon etc. It’s usually good to have some global core in your portfolio.

**Growth** are stocks that are usually comparatively expensive, considering their earnings. This is due to their growth prospect, and the promise of better returns in the future. Typical industries that have growth classification is Tech and Healthcare. In my opinion, the most bubbly valuations can be found here, as it’s hard to quantify future earnings accurately. Personally, I don’t hold too many growth ETFs if I can help it.

I understand that managing by geography, size and type can be too troublesome for the retail investors. There are tools like Morningstar X-ray out there, where you can key in your holdings and this pops out.

http://imgur.com/4bS59l6  My ETF holdings some time ago (Produced with Morningstar)

As you can see, my holdings are mostly in large caps, because I am pretty conservative when it comes to investing. I try to stay away from small cap because those guys are too volatile for me. I have strong preference for value stocks too, which I will explain later why. For now just try to keep the stock style matrix well spread out or top heavy and you will be OK.

**Sectors**
Different sectors behave differently, and you will have to diversify likewise accordingly.

If you are more conservative, go for utilities, telcos, consumer staples and consumer discretionary. Materials and Industrials somewhat applies too.
If you are more aggressive, then hold healthcare, energy and IT stocks. Try not to have more than 20% of your portfolio in one sector, as sector valuations commonly move together.

**Fund houses**

Vanguard, Blackrock, Guggenheim, Credit Suisse etc. These are fund houses. You should try to diversify your holdings across fund houses because funds from the same house can have a selection bias. The selection bias may lead to a concentration in your holdings. We want diversification, not concentration.

**Leveraged ETFs**

Avoid them. The roll costs are usually too painful. Owning leveraged ETFs is like owning a pet crocodile. It’s all fun and dandy at the start, but if you keep them for too long, it will return to bite you in the ass. Time horizon for keeping leveraged ETFs should be max. a few months.

**Inverse ETFs**

Avoid them. Roll costs again. Betting against the market long term, correlates with negative returns.

**Investment Strategies**

Here, we shall discuss some of the investment strategies prevalent in today’s markets.
Buy and hold

Personally, I like to buy and hold. Less transaction charges, which correlates strongly with better long term performance. Set aside some money from your income every month, and put them in pre-defined ETFs. Then just hold them all the way till you need the money or you are convinced your holdings are too overvalued. (For valuation, google either: PE, Shiller PE/CAPE, PB)

I believe the market is cyclical. Like the oft quoted phrase, the stock markets short term is a voting machine, and long term a weighing machine. What I do is when I am drinking coffee in the morning and reading the news, I keep an eye out for turmoil. Usually everyone is selling &amp; dumping when turmoil hits, so you just wait and watch the discount grow while the fear mounts. After some time, I invest in that country or sector. Then I forget about it. Since my investment horizon is a few decades, I have time to spare till that sector or country picks up again.

**Case**: At time of writing,

1. Russia is placed under sanctions and experiencing weak oil prices.

2. Brazil has political turmoil through a corruption scandal of Rousseff

3. Malaysia political class is facing corruption allegations, suffering oil prices

4. Energy sector getting destroyed through low oil prices

5. Financial sector battered through low interest rates

These are stuff you see on the news all the time. For point 1,2 &amp; 3, you can purchase Russian (RSX), Brazilian (EWZ) or Malaysian (EWM) stocks or their bonds (ELD, EMSH), or both. Usually they are at a discount when crisis hits.

For point 3 &amp; 4, you can purchase sector specific ETFs. Energy (VDE, XLE) and financial (VFH, FNCL, XLF)sectors are relatively cheap compared to before.

You can make proxy bets too. Ask yourself. If oil is cheap, which countries or sectors would benefit the most? Countries like India (INDA, EPI) and Philippines (EPHE) import a lot of oil as a percentage of GDP. Airlines (JETS, ITA) and transportation (IYT) companies spend the majority of costs on fuel. Cheap oil bodes well for all of them, so you can expect their business outlooks to improve and that they will provide good returns.

My strategy is basically bargain hunting. I wait outside the supermarket till something goes on discount, then I saunter in and pick it up. Buy low, sell high, remember? Unfortunately, this strategy is not for everyone. You need to have patience to ride out the market turmoil and cycles. You also have to keep your hands away from the trading platform, which is harder than expected. No matter what, remember to keep your investments diversified.

I shall include the other strategies here for discussion sake. I do not necessarily think these are good ideas.

**Smart Beta**

Smart beta is the new game in town. Personally I think it’s stupid. Even sad to a point. The idea is so dumb, they put the word Smart in front of it. Its like naming your son Smart, hoping that it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Smart beta is the desperate way asset managers try to remain relevant today. The sorry sad fact is, most asset managers suck sweaty balls. When they outperform, they can’t repeat the fluke. You are better off just indexing. Asset managers realized that, and try to reduce a winning strategy to beat the index, by making an index with simple rules, then following it blindly.

The rules are anomalies identified from academic literature. They back-test (also known as lying to themselves) it, then fiddle around to find a formula to deliver the best result they were looking at. The problem is, once an anomaly is discovered in the market, it cannot continue. People will arbitrage the profits away. Well, at least most of these funds are kind of diversified.

**Momentum**
These ETFs seek out stocks or sectors that are gaining momentum. They are usually an ETF of ETFs, which results in higher expense ratios. Momentum ETF usually have 
different geographical focuses. Expect the global ones to incur more expense charges. The high fees are why I avoid them.

The most held momentum ETF is First Trust Dorsey Wright Focus 5 ETF (FV), which as of the time of writing includes:

First Trust Utilities (FXU)

First Trust Consumer discretion (FXD)

First Trust Internet (FDN)

First Trust Consumer Staples (FXG)

First Trust Energy (FXN)

This ETF holds 5 different ETFs of the 5 sectors that have the most momentum in trading. Sly mofos double-charging their expense ratios too. One thing to take note is that because the ETF changes its holdings drastically, it could create unexpected concentration risk in your holdings.

**Long Short**

Long short can have long and short positions in different assets. Long means you own the stock. Short means you sell a stock you do not currently own, in the hopes that the price drops and so you can conduct the cancelling trade and profit. There may be an underlying objective, where the ETF claims it will be 130/30 for example. This means its 130% long and 30% short. I avoid long shorts because their expense ratio is high, averaging near 1%.

**Volatility Hedged**

These ETFs invest in equities and volatilities derivatives. In English, it means that they buy insurance against wild swings in prices. The good thing is the downside is supposedly hedged. The bad thing is that you have to pay for this protection, meaning that the hedge hinders performance. I have not tried their services, and hence can’t recommend them.

**Merger arbitrage**
This one is cool. I am not sure though if this strategy provides long term returns. When a company buys another company, the buyer usually has to pay more for the target. Merger arbitrage funds (MNA) will check out the M&amp;A scene and hold positions in the target companies, to earn this premium. Problem is, an ETF like this typically holds only a few stock. Since mergers and acquisitions typically happen in only a few industries where scale pays off, your holdings in a fund like this would be concentrated too. Thirdly, you are not protected against a market sell-off. Worse still, in the event that there is a sell off, the merger would probably not take place and you would not have earned the premium.

Momentum, Long-short, Volatility Hedged, Merger arbitrage ETFs are usually actively managed. Means more fees to pay.

**Conclusion**
ETFs are really simple to get started, and to put your investments in your hands. Through ETFs, its easy to gain diversification. Decide if you are a risk-taker or risk-averse, define an investment philosophy and hone a strategy, then cast a wide net across geographical, asset types, asset sizes, sectors and fund houses, forget about your investments, until the day you need money to cure the cancer you got from midnight binge on dank memes. Good luck.

16-04-08,4dwgq6,Looking for advice or European partner for lucrative business,"Hope this is ok for this sub. Couldn't find a better fitted one because this is geared at someone who likes to make a good return.

I'm currently living in Tanzania where the exchange rate is approximately 1 EURO = 2300 Tanzanian Shillings(fluctuates around 2300-2400).

As a tourist town, people are generally tipping with their 1EURO/2EURO coins. They also spend their coins on small purchases.

The exchange rate on coins that the locals get for these coins is 1500 shillings for every 1 coin.

If we come in an offer 1600-1700, we could get a lot of euro coins. I have already amassed about 2000 Euro coins over the years without trying and was looking for a way to get rid of them and thought it might be a good idea to make a business out of it.

I currently deal with USD/EUR/TSH so this works if I am able to find someone in Europe(or elsewhere) that could help come up with some ideas.

I see the initial upside being around 20-30%. The biggest issue is the weight on these but it's something to consider and factor into the margins. Even if we end up with a few % it's a viable business.

I am looking for a triple-leveraged ETF that follows the the VIX, but also has options trading.  $UVXY is the closest that I can come, but that is only double-leveraged.  Of course there are a number of 3x's which have option trading, but most following either commodities, indices, or market sectors--none of which have the volatility of the VIX.  If any of you know if this particular product exists, I'd be thankful for the tip.  And afterwards, in true yolo fashion, you can go fuck yourself.

Thanks.  -Mr. B",0

I'm just getting my investing feet wet (college student, been investing for a little over a year) and I was interested in perhaps buying shares in foreign companies. Nothing particular yet because I haven't done thorough research yet, but probably Japanese or Chinese companies. 

Does anyone have tips/advice/concerns about purchasing foreign equities? As far as I know, you have to be careful about the exchange rate because it might go up in Yen but if the Yen depreciates then you're running a net loss. Anything else I should keep in mind?

16-04-08,4dutp5,Dow Index vs. Dow ETF opening price discrepancy?,"Take today (April 7) for example. The same thing also happened April 5th. If you look at the Dow historical prices, the open price of 17,687.28 is the same as the high for the day, meaning it was only down from that point the whole day. It closed at 17,541.96. If you shorted at the open, you wouldn't have had a losing position all day. But if you actually wanted to trade this, and if you like the ultrapro ETFs like I do, you'd probably use SDOW, which had an opening price of 16.06, but a low of 15.98, and closed at 16.21. Remember, even though it's like shorting, you are still going long, so the comparison to the index is a little counterintuitive. The question I have is, if the index itself never ran above the opening price, why would the ETF dip below it's opening price? It seems the quoted open price for the index itself is also never actually where the ticker starts for the day. What causes this? How is the opening price for the index determined? Why isn't the ETF tracking directly with the index?",1

16-04-08,4duv45,Copper price about to plunge?,"""China may be about to shock the global copper market by unleashing some of its stockpiles of the metal, which are near record highs, onto the global market.

Four traders of copper, including two from state-owned Chinese smelters, said they expect China to raise its copper exports - which are usually tiny - in the next few months. China's refined copper exports averaged less than 10,000 tonnes a month in the first two months of 2016, and around 17,000 a month in 2015.

If higher exports materialize, they will be a major jolt to producers and investors in the metal across the world - in particular because it would come during what is traditionally the strongest period of demand for copper from China, the world's largest consumer of the metal.

It will also be a further sign that the Chinese economy is still struggling against headwinds. Some sectors that buy copper - such as construction and manufacturing - have been hit especially hard in the past couple of years. ""

1) I was trying to identify stocks trading below their cash value. Is this the same as the FinViz Price/Cash below 1? This is defined as Price per share/ Cash Per share.

2) It looks like in Martin Shkreli's videos he is taking the forecasted Net Income, discounting it by the chosen discount rate and then dividing it by the share number to get the stock price, this is an earnings per share technique. But why is he using Net Income rather than say Free cash flow? If a company is very capex heavy here will be deprecation expenses influencing NI, ditto if the firm is highly levered vs no debt.

I've started to make a living for myself with a company I helped start that manages Pay Per Click Advertising. I've networked myself into a great position, while still having very low living expenses, and I don’t even graduate from business school until this May.

The point is, I'm making a good living now and know I will be coming into quite a bit of extra income when I graduate, enough to establish some risk capital for me to start investing safety. 

I have been learning and reading immensely about the Foriegn Exchange (FOREX) market and obviously the US Stock exchange. I’ve been reading the Wall Street Journal the past 6 months and just basically want a deep, deeeeep understanding of what I am doing before I start making major decisions (None of those Oanda demo accounts) with my money. I was approached from an old friend who was trying to get me into that ImarketsLive ""Global Visionariez"" ""Forex makes You Rich"" bullshit which I have researched deeply and found to be bullshit. This turned me off from Forex trading, although I know it’s an incredible economy of scale. 

I am trying to figure out, from some experienced folk, where I should continue putting my learning efforts? I want to continue learning and researching how to trade and find leverage for at least another 3-6 months before I make any moves. Which is a more realistic route to take? Which market has the best opportunity? I’m open for all interpretation so please share! Thank you.

There are also a mid cap and small cap index for 0.30%. Everything else is up around 0.80-1.30%. The ""aggressive model"" has an expense ratio of 1%.

I have a few ideas, but also met with an additional question. Question first.

1) With the recent tax inversion rule updates, what can be done moving forward? This may be basic, but lets say PFE were to purchase SHPG. How would that impact PFE's tax situation? Given that SHPG would account for &lt;20% of pro-forma sales, what impact would it have on the overall company from a tax standpoint. 

I personally see merits to Pfizer, Allergan and/or Biogen to come in and place an over-the-top bid for Shire. Valuations are cheap and all 3 would be strategic in nature. 

Pfizer and Allergan have previously came out and spoken about their interest in purchasing Shire in the past. Shire's exposure to rare drugs gives it pricing power and has enabled the company to become a large fish in a small pond. It's reliance on Vyvanse is potentially troubling, however, given its ~27% of overall sales (patent power until 2023).

16-04-09,4dz91t,[Noob] So I lost $5400 in 3 weeks.,"Hey everyone.

I started trading blindly, it was bound to happen and I'm glad it happened early on before I lost something bigger. 

This is just a general question about /r/stocks. I did ALOT of research into how to trade *cough* after I lost money. At the beginning I was trading blindly. I went on www.barcharts.com, saw popular stocks and bought in at market (cringes). 

I learned from my mistakes and now I want to turn my remaining $2,000 into $7,400 before September. I want to play it safe and I'd like some advice on how to do that?

Right now, I'm looking at financial reporting calendars to see when popular companies are reporting (I check at least 2 weeks prior) and I watch the stock. I check the support and resistance lines and if the stock is near the support (but hadn't touched it), I watch it and set an alert. If it hits support, I watch it closer and once it starts to rise, I buy in and I sell after the earnings come out. 

I'm not sure if my strategy is going to kill me or make me. I look into alot of things when choosing a company, like past year's reporting ""jumps"" (example, if I see a stock spike around the same time the earnings report came in last time) and I see the companies projected EPS is positive (from last year and last quarter), I watch the stock. I don't invest in companies who are predicted to post a loss or negative EPS. 

I'm just looking for general feedback. 

Thanks.",15

16-04-09,4dzhwn,"Gernade's Guide: Don't be a Dufus...Trade the PDUFAs!","**Intro:** Hey cucks and cuckettes, here's my guide to trading Biotech PDUFA dates.  Da fuq is a PDUFA?  The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) was a law passed by the United States Congress in 1992 which allowed the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to collect fees from drug manufacturers to fund the new drug approval process(WTF???). AKA if a company wants a drug approved, u gotta get ur shit passed through the FDA if u wanna have a legit drug.


**Theory:**  A PDUFA date provides a win/lose catalyst for biotech stocks.  If a company's drug gets approved, the stock gonna go up.  If it doesn't get approved, that shit is gonna tank like the rest of your god damn portfolio (SUNE and MNKD bag holders im lookin at u).  There is a lot of risk involved, but if you sell prior to the PDUFA, you remove that risk.  The way you can capitalize on this is buying a small starter position early before the run-up position begins, and slowly loading up your position until you reach YOLO capacity, then blowing your **'YOLOAD'** prior to PDUFA date for a profit.


**For you faggots who can't comprehend:** [Gernades PDUFUS Chart](http://imgur.com/B20EhX0)


**Most recent examples of this strategy:**


**TTNP:** This stock originally had their PDUFA scheduled for the end of March, but chose to extend their date toward the end of May.  The stock was in $3.50s in Feb/March and has been steadily climbing and is now trading over $5 (&gt;30%). This will probably continue to May and be over $6/share.


**CHMA:** This stock started its PDUFA ""run-up"" late (2 weeks prior to PDUFA date of April 15th), but has seen some incredible gains (&gt;30%).  It is very low float, so quite volatile. Lots of people have already blown their yoloads here, so be careful.


**PGNX:** This stock has just begun it's PDUFA run-up and had their date extended to July 17th.  I fully expect this to reach the high $5 range before their PDUFA date. Some people may blow their yoloads early, but I like to hold mine as long as possible.


**HRTX:** This PDUFA is due any date now...March 7th: $17.56, April 8th: $20.58. If you're holding this one, you should probably blow your yoload.


**Conclusion:**  By using predictable sociology patterns of how people invest in stocks, we can somewhat see a trend in this market strategy. Buy pre-PDUFA 2-3 months before PDUFA and sell a week before PDUFA. 


**TL;DR:** Go fuck your self!",50

16-04-09,4dzm0n,My attempt at a DD on $APRI.,"So this is my first attempt at a DD, please tell me what I did right and wrong. 

Apricus Biosciences, Inc ($APRI) is a pharmaceutical company whos products include Vitaros and Femprox. They had something called fispemifene that apparently wasnt doing too hot so theyre immediately discontinuing clinical activities for it. They released an updated game-plan the other day stating that they are planning on significantly cutting operating costs, and transitioning their focus to the success of Vitaros. 

Current price: .61
52 week high: 1.99
52 week low: 0.56

Polled analysts see the stock hitting between 0.75 to $5.5 over the next year. (I think $5.5 isnt very realistic.) The consensus price target on shares is currently $3.355

-The company recently stated it will aim to reduce operating costs by 30% over the next year. 

-ten new country launches for Vitaros in 2016

-reduce operating expenses by 60% in 2017

-discontinue focus on all other projects, focusing primarily on Vitaros

-Vitaros is a topical cream used to treat erectile dysfunction 

-between 15-25% of 65 year old men suffer from ED

-plans to re-submit NDA for Vitaros in Q3

-current rsi of ~30, meaning the stock is oversold. 

So what I think and hope will happen is that the price will slowly begin to rise, due to it currently being oversold, as well as the company's new streamlined approach. They plan to reduce operating costs significantly, while focusing on the success of their ED treatment, Vitaros. If the company receives approval in the US for Vitaros, I can see the stock jumping quite significantly. I plan to get in now around .60 and ride it up for the time being. 

I know theres some things I missed since this is my first attempt at a DD. ",13

16-04-09,4dzodn,"Retirement portfolio for the ""new normal"" - help me improve it!","I've been tweaking my portfolio for my retirement accounts that aims to capitalize on the somewhat broadly expected lower - but steady -  growth in equities in coming years.  I use the term ""new normal"" very tongue in cheek but it's in common enough use that I figure it describes what I mean.  With the expectation seeming to be lower growth but also lower volatility, I've put together a portfolio I think would do very well in those conditions.  This is for retirement accounts (401k, IRAs, HSAs), so no margin and no shorting available, hence the leveraged ETFs.  

15% VNQ - Vanguard REIT Index ETF  
20% SSO - ProShares Ultra S&amp;P500 (2x daily SPY)  
10% UPRO - ProShares UltraPro S&amp;P 500 (3x daily SPY)  
10% VO -  Vanguard Mid-Cap Index ETF  
10% VYM - Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index ETF  
20% BND - Vanguard Total Bond Fund  
5% EDV - Vanguard Extended Duration Treasury Index ETF  
5% JNK - SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond ETF  
5% ZIV - VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Medium Term ETN  

I've used portfolio visualizer and such to test this, but the short history of ZIV and UPRO don't allow for more than a few years back for those components (though the others do very well).  However, we know that short volatility and 2x/3x daily SPY have done very well historically, and if volatility stays relatively low going forward, they will do even better than they have before.  **Edit: Wow, lots of disagreement on the long term performance of leveraged equity.  Looking back to 1986, 2x and 3x daily SPY would've crushed 1x SPY, even after crashes, fees, etc.  Looking back even further and at other markets, 2x leverage seems to be ideal: http://ddnum.com/articles/leveragedETFs.php  The future would have to be *significantly* more volatile than the past for this to not work.  Please contribute something more than ""don't buy and hold leveraged ETFs"" if you don't understand why people offer that advice and why it doesn't apply to bull equity ETfs**

The biggest weaknesses to this portfolio that I can see are no international exposure and no small cap exposure.  My main reason for not having international exposure is that I have no confidence in foreign governments to not fuck up their economies and businesses.  I also believe that the economy is global enough now that beneficial growth abroad (that escapes the grubby hands of government) should make its way to the US eventually.   As for not having small caps, I've left those out due to their lack of a dividend (if lower growth is on the horizon, I at least want yield) and for the relatively poor performance of them since the crash.  I don't know if this is a more long term trend; perhaps small companies with the really good ideas stay private and then get bought by large-cap companies, shifting growth to large-cap companies?  I don't know.   I'm more than open to thoughts and criticism on this one. 

I'm sure there are concerns about the leverage and the volatility.  The only way I can see the leverage being a problem is if the next 30 years is much more volatile then the last 30 years. But even then there is a lot of room for error, since daily-leveraged on the S&amp;P since 1986 would have performed substantially better than the S&amp;P itself.  RE is heavy, as I don't see real estate slowing down long term as urbanization continues and land values and rents go up while governments constrain new development more and more.  I picked VYM to again shoot for the dividend yield, and then VO to include some mid-caps, which are underrepresented in VYM, SSO, and UPRO.

Very curious to hear thoughts and feedback. ",0
16-04-09,4dzoog,This is why I think we should short crude oil. DD $DWTI,"So oil prices are really volatile right now and everyone is talking about this production freeze.

Since they're talking about a freeze, we should go long oil right? Wrong...

I believe the freeze is extremely unlikely to happen and this is why...

Back in 2006 Iran was doing some irrelevant shit with uranium.

The rest of the world figured they were enriching it to make a nuke; Iran said it was experimenting with nuclear power.

[Regardless of the truth, the United Nations put sanctions on the export and sale of oil as well as some other shit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctions_against_Iran#UN_sanctions_against_Iran) on them.

These sanctions messed up their economy (and other things) and has left them in a sort of struggle.

In January of this year, the sanctions were lifted after Iran came to an agreement with the U.N. to stop playing with uranium.

So Iran JUST got back it's oil sale and oil exporting abilities in exchange for dumping their nuclear plans...

[""Shortly after the removal of the sanctions, Iran increased its oil production by several hundred thousand barrels per day. Iran’s Oil Minister Bijan Zangeneh has emphasized that the country will increase its oil production by a further 500,000 barrels per day within the next months.""](http://www.iran-daily.com/News/138561.html)

With the accord between Iran and the P5+1 now reached, sanctions relief will affect the economy of Iran in [four principal ways:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctions_against_Iran#Sanctions_relief)

1. Release of Iran’s frozen funds abroad, estimated at over $100 billion as of 2015, of which approximately $29 billion was blocked.

2. The removal of sanctions against exports of Iranian oil.

3. Allow foreign firms to invest in Iran’s oil and gas, automobiles, hotels and other sectors.

4. Allow Iran to trade with the rest of the world and use the global banking system such as SWIFT.

On January 16, 2016, it was announced by the International Atomic Energy Agency that the nation had adequately dismantled its nuclear weapons program, allowing for the United Nations to lift sanctions immediately.

If you think Iran is gonna give up its nuclear program to get their oil sales back, and then join the freeze to show us they're part of the team, you're insane.

Although, on the other hand, if oil prices stay this low it could [destroy the economies of the ""fragile five"" countries.](http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2015/08/20/oilprice-dotcom-oil-prices-fragile-five/32033553/) 

So it's also possible the world police step in and do some crazy ass shit to stop them. You never know... They might find out they have WMDs.

So really it all comes down to whether or not you think the U.S. is gonna force them. I'm going with no freeze though. If you think I'm wrong for some reason, please let me know because I don't want to be wrong.


Edit: I also believe Iran knows they have more oil than they could sell in 100 years and that oil is becoming less useful as technologies progress. so they want to get that cash asap. if iran sold all its estimated oil (138.4B barrels) at $20 they would still make $2.768T.",37

16-04-09,4e01zs,"During this Panama Papers issue, is buying currency a good idea?","With the panama papers which have surfaced recently, on a 20 year timeline I believe this is a blip. Right now, the financial companies involved could dip down %30 from their 52 week high. Does anyone see opportunity here? Suppose you have a US based account, and you are in your mid 20's. Whatever stocks you have are in a conventional investing account and you intend to withdraw in 20~30 years paying a Long-Term capital gains tax.

Right now I figure the easiest way to make money from this would be to buy HSBC, which I did earlier today. What does anyone see that would be less risky with higher return than buying HSBC, and holding for 20 years collecting dividends which are over %8. These people printed currency in Hong Kong as recently as 2010.

16-04-09,4e06gg,Market timing strategy or is it just human nature?,"I see a lot of folks talking about how most people lose money when timing the markets and that this is evidence against trying to beat the market.   But how many of those that lose money or underperform relative to a buy and hold are actually people emotionally responding to market changes and not investors purposefully trying to buy/sell with a market timing strategy?


I would assume that people who devise a timing strategy and stick to it without emotion would be able to do pretty well.  It is people who emotionally respond to a sudden drop or chasing high returns in a fund after Q1 that make ""market timing"" look bad.

16-04-09,4e1g5h,Passive income through dividends,"Looking for advice/general knowledge from people who have built passive income through dividends, and invested primarily to achieve a high dividend return.

Some info about me for context: Recently graduated from grad school with very high debt ($188,000) but very high income ($190k+). Obviously, debt is number 1 and I'm also maxing 401k. 

I'm not worried about maximizing 401k through any other route, my job offers a Roth 401k, along with 14% of base pay starting on month 25 and going indefinitely.

Once the debt is paid (current estimates are 3.5-4 years), the wealth building will begin. After a lot of reading I've decided on paper assets as my ticket to wealth.

So, how did you get started with dividend building? I saw the S&amp;amp;P dividend aristocrat fund, is this any good? Looking for advice from those who've done it!

Somehow, I lost $66.58. I trade through USAA which charges an $8.95 commission per trade. So that accounts for $17.90 of the $66.58, making the total unexplainable loss $48.68. If you know what happened, please feel free to skip the following speculation and straighten me out in the comments. 
Here's what I'm thinking happened. Even though I set the limit price at $0.50, I think that it cleared at roughly $0.5088. 0.5088 * 8363 + 8.95 = 4264.04. Also, even though my activity feed shows the sale of the 8363 shares at $0.51, I think that they actually sold for about $0.50298. 0.50298 * 8363 - 8.95 = 4197.47. In this case, the sale was at market price, so I have no issue with it being sold below $0.51 other than that I would like for it to be displayed as such in my activity feed. The purchase would be my problem. Is it common for limit prices to be exceeded on a purchase of penny stocks at high volume? Is this something that I should expect in the future?",4

2) The 15 DMA has flattened and failed to cross above the 40 DMA. This TA has a pretty strong track record if you didn't know. 

3) The MACD has had a short period of divergence but is beginning a downward turn around on a long term base and has already signaled a sell signal on a short term base.

4) Momentum from the RMI indicator is dying out and beginning a downward trend.

5) Volume is still in a negative trend on the two Dow Indexes mentioned earlier.

6) The Keltner Channels have entered inside the Bollinger Bands. This TA is what one might consider ""Vodoo"" but whenever that happens, a shit ton of momentum usually occurs, and in this case, it will be downward pressure momentum.

Invest Foolishly! This is the second time we've recommended Illumina. When we re-recommend a stock, it's a sign of extra confidence in a company we already know well. While we don't advocate buying too much of any stock, we think you should give this one a longer look as you build a well-diversified portfolio of 15 or more stocks to own for at least three to five years.

WHAT IT DOES

The company develops, manufactures, and markets next-generation life-science tools and integrated systems to analyze genetic variations and biological functions.

WHY BUY

The undisputed leader in gene-sequencing systems has a highly visible business based on recurrent sales and a strong backlog.
A relatively recent push into molecular diagnostics promises another leg of growth.

Illumina's stock has come down sharply over some relatively minor stumbles.

Biggest Threat: The company can't keep an edge in molecular diagnostics

Data as of 3/15/16. Dollar amounts in millions except recent price.

This month I'm re-recommending a company that has been instrumental in the advance of the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. In the 13 years since the conclusion of the Human Genome Project, it's pushed the cost and time of sequencing a full human genome from $3 billion and 10 years to $1,000 and mere hours. If that doesn't interest you, consider this: Since my original July 2008 recommendation, its stock has risen about 250%. Even against the robust returns of the market since that time, that's market-thumping performance.

Yet Illumina's (NASDAQ: ILMN) stock has seen better days. It's about 35% off its 52-week high, trading around the same level it was in early 2014. You could look at that as an example of a growing tech company that has achieved maturity, but I think that would be misreading the signs. Illumina's stock was in full ascent until last summer, when it got caught up in increasing pessimism about the biotechnology sector as well as a volatile market. While the company has had a few stumbles of its own, I think they're being way overblown — and that the continuing potential of the company is much under-appreciated. Read on to find out why.

Illumina Inside

Illumina is less biotech and more plain old tech. It deals primarily in hardware — DNA sequencing systems of varying size and capabilities, as well as the consumable supplies, software, and informatics needed to run them. You could call it the picks-and-shovels provider of the genomics revolution: Some biotech companies have struck it rich on discoveries made by mining genomic data while many others have struck out, but Illumina has made lots of money selling the tools. In 2015, it produced over $475 million in free cash flow on $2.2 billion in revenue. And the gold rush it's supplying is far from over — in fact, it's broadening into new possibilities.

Illumina's traditional customers have been researchers — academic and government labs and, especially, pharmaceutical and biotech companies that need sequence information to guide the discovery and development of new drugs. Whether they want the massive HiSeq X Ten or HiSeq X Five systems for population-scale genomic studies, or the desktop MiSeq and MiniSeq systems for more focused studies of specific parts of the genome, this is Illumina's bread and butter.

As of the end of 2015, the company had an installed base of around 8,000 systems of various types. These have become entrenched parts of not just research laboratories, but also other businesses. If you get a genome scan from 23andme or Ancestry.com, that's running on Illumina microarrays. If you get an Oncotype DX breast cancer analysis from Genomic Health (NASDAQ: GHDX), that's running on Illumina sequencers. The same goes for many diagnostic and research labs. And each of those systems requires consumable reagents and, depending on the product, flow cells or microarrays to run. Last year, instrument sales accounted for only 27% of Illumina's revenue. A full 58% came from consumables, with the remaining 15% coming from services that, as I'll discuss next, may become the most exciting part of the company.

Why Not Start When You're Healthy?

I mentioned diagnostics earlier. I should be more specific and say molecular diagnostics. Labs have long used various diagnostic techniques to analyze disease, from culturing cells to centrifuging blood to staining tissue and studying samples under a microscope. But molecular diagnostics is specifically about gene sequence — you identify, say, a specific bacteria not by growing it up in culture and seeing how various antibiotics affect it, but by finding its genetic signature. As sequencing technology has improved, it's becoming increasingly central to the diagnosis and even the treatment of disease.

Illumina has tapped this market by making machines specifically for diagnostic applications. That does mean systems like its MiSeqDx had to go through an FDA approval process (unlike its lab systems), but it opens up major new markets. Illumina only stepped into this area with the approval of the MiSeqDx in late 2013, and it should grow as new disease-specific tests are developed. The company is also relatively early in the process of capturing human leukocyte antigen (HLA) analysis for pre-transplant patients and the forensics market.

And a new market the company is pioneering could be even bigger. In January, Illumina announced it was launching Grail, an independent business that will do certified diagnostics based on Illumina's technology. Backed by investors including Bill Gates andAmazon.com's (NASDAQ: AMZN) Jeff Bezos to the tune of $100 million in a Series A venture round, Grail is aiming not for doing disease-specific tests but rather for screening healthy people for cancers at their earliest stages.

Since the outlook for many cancers is better the earlier they're caught, the idea is clearly appealing. But the sensitivity required to capture the genetic signature of a cancer in a non-invasive blood test has only recently become possible. Illumina CEO Jay Flatley has suggested that screening for breast cancer alone could represent a $20 billion to $40 billion market if a test could be devised to detect stage 2 cancer, but that could rise to $100 billion if a reliable stage 1 test could be developed.

It makes sense that Illumina is doing this as an independent business. It is planning a clinical trial spanning 100,000 to 300,000 people, sequenced with multiple passes. That alone is huge business for Illumina, independent of the stake it has in Grail.

Illumina's Clear Light

Illumina's valuation certainly isn't as rich as it was before the stock began its retreat, but it still looks expensive by many measures, trading at about 31 times trailing EBITDA and about 51 times reported earnings from 2015. Nevertheless, its growth has been extraordinary, with the top line growing at a 20% compound rate over the past five years, with adjusted earnings per share rising 26% annually.

Much of the business is highly visible: Not only does the bulk of revenue come from recurring consumable sales, but the company also entered 2016 with a backlog of $560 million, making many of its instrument sales relatively secure. Its expectation that sales will climb 16% in 2016 (or 17% on a constant-currency basis) is likely to prove conservative. And with continuing demand from the core R&amp;D business being increasingly supplemented by the diagnostics business — both Grail and the labs performing disease-specific tests — Illumina should continue to grow the bottom line at a 17% to 20% pace over the next five years, with a wild card from Grail that could push growth higher.

Risks and When We'd Sell

While Illumina's long-term future looks bright, the past year has been a bit disappointing. Decelerating sales growth — and an outright decline in profits in the fourth quarter — has investors worrying that the company's best days are behind it. The issues have been varied — at first it was slower sales of desktop systems, then high-end HiSeq systems, with currency headwinds all the while. The company did cut its guidance at one point, but it ultimately ended 2015 with top-line growth of 19.3% versus an original forecast of 20%.

A company with a premium valuation should surpass expectations, not fall short — even by a modest amount — but I see this as a transitory issue. There's been no lasting pattern of weak demand in any part of the business that should overly concern us at this point.

Another development the market has been unhappy about is the recently announced departure of Flatley as CEO. Certainly Flatley, who has led the company since 1999, is responsible for much of Illumina's success — not only in terms of acquiring and developing technology, but also leading a legal strategy that has kept the company well ahead of its competitors. However, while Flatley will no longer oversee day-to-day operations, he will continue to be the architect of the company's long-term strategy as executive chairman. Francis deSouza — an entrepreneur hired from Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) in 2013 — will take over as CEO.

The Foolish Bottom Line

The ability to sequence the entire human genome, quickly and at a reasonable cost, is a transformative technology. But we're still only seeing its earliest impacts. After all, have you had your genome completely sequenced? I firmly believe that you eventually will, and that Illumina is likely to be a driving force behind it. Under Flatley's continuing guidance, Illumina continues to view gene sequencing as a mass-market technology, and it's pushing to tap that market in a way none of its competitors can. Whether it's Helix — the company's on-demand genotyping service for consumers — or Grail, Illumina is fixed on the idea that its technology can improve everyone's health. As it moves out of the laboratory and into our lives, investors should see further rewards — easy as ACGT.",45

They're a fun case study, read up on abenomics, their NIRP, aging population, etc...there's a deep rabbit hole you can get in when it comes to global markets. 

I've heard people bitching about the currency market not making sense after Japan adopts NIRP yet the Yen is appreciating. Boo fucking hoo. Interest rates aren't the only driver of currency. In order to understand what's going on with the Yen, you should be paying attention to a few things:

a. **monetary policy:** typically higher interest rates means currency appreciation. More printing means depreciation. 

b. **trade balance:** more demand (i.e. increasing positive net exports) means currency appreciation. [Japanese net exports have been on a sharp rise since 2014 shifting from a net negative to net positive exporter.](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/japan/balance-of-trade)

c. **GDP:** there a positive correlation between rising GDP and currency appreciation. As aggregate demand goes up, currencies rise. If you know anything about economics, I just said the same thing twice. [Japanese GDP has seen many ups and downs since the mid-90s amid growing global GDP, but generally flat.](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:JPN:CHN:KOR&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:JPN:CHN:USA&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false)

d. **debt:** this really comes into play when a country is neck deep in shit and defaults on their bonds. Not a huge influence for developed countries IMO.[ It should be pointed out that Japan has a very high debt-to-gdp ratio.](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/japan/government-debt-to-gdp) **Holy fuck batman 229%**?

e. **other countries:** what's happening with inflation? Let's take the U.S. for example. The fed believes that gradual rate hikes will be prudent. This, as we know, should cause the USD to appreciate, holding all else equal. One effect rising interest rates creates is that it will result in higher inflation. Now, this is where I get to the relationship between inflation and currency. If international inflation is high relative to domestic inflation, this will have an appreciating influence on domestic ~~interest~~ exchange rates. Among other factors, this is because goods in Japan are cheaper relative to goods in the USA. If the USA and Japan were the only two countries in the world, if the US is creating a rise in inflation, and[ Japan is creating a drop in inflation](http://asia.nikkei.com/Politics-Economy/Economy/Japan-firms-slash-inflation-forecasts-amid-lower-oil-prices) , this means, holding everything equal, the Yen appreciates. While simplistic, it helps illustrate a very complex relationship. There are many countries in the world, with different rates of inflation. I think a lot of countries can be treated as ""noise"" when trading pairs or inferring moves in equity markets from implications in the forex market. Key currencies are the USD, Yen, EUR, GBP, China, etc. When I model currencies, I look at the size of an economy as well. So inflation in the USA and China (which are both rising) will have a greater influence than in South Africa, for example.


**So how do you YOLO this shit?**

First of all, I'm not going to tell you what to buy or sell. That's up to you. But consider this. Knowing what you know now, before making a trade decision, think to yourself: how do moves in the ForEx market influence equities, bonds, etc.? What do you think Abe will do next? What about the rest of the world? What are the big banks and market makers doing? [Here's a chart of the USD/YEN with some key fib levels at a Q311 low to a Q116 high.](http://i.imgur.com/WlYNGpp.png) Once you formulate a good hypothesis go ahead and smash that buy/sell button. 

* Trade direct on the forex market with leverage (very risky if you're a retard who doesn't know what they are doing). Great way to lose more than what you invested, but also a great way to earn handsome returns, so I would consider it /r/wsb appropriate. Bonus points if you can get over 200x leverage.

* Leveraged ETFs:  JPNL (3x equities bull), JPNS (3x  equities bear), JGBT (3x gvt. bond bull), JGBD (3x gvt. bond bear) - these aren't very liquid. Bonds have lower movement I wouldn't consider them as rewarding as the first two if you're day trading.

[Here](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT01412424?term=octreolin&amp;rank=1&amp;sect=X39870156) are the results from the Phase 3 trials. I am not an expert, but the results look pretty promising. 

After some Googling, I found that all of the ways to treat Acromegaly require injection. Chiasma's drug going up for PDUFA is taken orally, and is the same as the drug in [Sandostatin](http://www.drugs.com/sandostatin.html), which is octreotide. Octreotide already works, and the [European Medicines Agency](https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/03/14/819616/0/en/Chiasma-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Year-End-2015-Results.html) has initiated their own Phase 3 Trials.

The point I'm trying to make is that even though the company has seen gains in the two weeks, I think we will see farther raises in the price in the coming week leading up to the PDUFA. The drug looks in good shape for approval.

Criticisms are encouraged.

Disclaimer: I have no position in the company yet. I plan on buying in sometime on Monday.

16-04-09,4e2zqf,What Is A Trading System?,"There is a lot of misinformation out there about what a trading system really is. The fact is the road to wealth in the stock market requires utilizing a trading system, so it’s important to understand.

A trading system is a part of your trading plan which not only determines how you find stocks to trade (or any type of assets) but also when is the optimal time to enter and exit a stock. It’s often based on statistical analysis or some other method of technical analysis which has been historically backtested and hopefully forward tested as well, in order to allow you to quantify specific historical patterns which result in expected outcomes. In the world of finance it is required by law to state past performance is not indicative of future performance but the reality is history repeats itself. Most businesses use some sort of historical forecasting to project a future outcome, so it isn’t hard to see why this is a necessity in the stock market as well.

To give you an example of what a trading system will do for you say A, B, C, D, and E occur (and these could be a number of different variables such as a technical indicator hitting a certain point, or the price of a stock reaching a certain level) your system will alert you to the fact that if you enter a stock there’s a high probability that a stock will move in a predictable way. The amount of price movement can vary and there is no way to predict with certainty how far a stock will go. This is why contrary to what most inexperienced traders think, there is NO system out there that is correct 100% of the time.  The good news is that this little built in  edge is what gives you a leg up on your competition and once you have this you’ll understand how traders make significant amounts of money with imperfect information…

If you take an average person who really has no idea what they are doing when it comes to the market (which is the majority of people out there) and ask them how they trade or invest, you’ll probably get a blank stare. Then they’ll say something along the lines of “I read all the financial news (Yahoo finance, Wall Street Journal, Barrons, Investor’s Business daily (William O’Neil), Klipingers, Money Magazine, CNBC, Bloomerberg) and then I make buy decisions based on what people such as analysts or other financial pundits (like Jim Cramer or the Fast Money Monkey’s) are staying about a stock… Another common thing you will hear is “I search for a stock with a product or service that I think is going to revolutionize the world (most of the times which is from a speculative penny stock) and I buy it with the belief that I am going to get rich quick. Yet another are the people that say they follow people on Twitter, Stock Twits, message boards, online chat rooms or pay for some guru’s stock alerts. The final group are the degenerate gamblers that throw darts and just buy random stocks based on hunches or stock tips that they heard about at a cocktail party.

The one thing that all these groups of people have in common is they all have infinitely small chance of ever becoming consistently profitable traders, or even making any money whatsoever. The truth is without a predetermined framework and trading plan which defined exactly what you will do under many of the various outcomes in the market, the chance of success is incredibly low. This is mostly because the stock market is designed to steal money from all of these ignorant people. I mean it! The algorithm’s seek out these unsophisticated market participants because they have been programmed to capitalize on the poor decisions of the general public.

Now in order to make money you don’t need anything magic but you do need to be looking at something which the small group of winning traders are also focusing on. This is almost always the exact opposite of what the majority of losing traders (which are often called the herd) are looking at which is why having a contrarian opinion is essential. There are many ways out there to make money in the market but the biggest challenging is identifying what works for you and learning to stick to those strategies day in and day out. Mastering your own psychology is truly the only way to succeed as a trader because even if you have that built in edge I referenced above, you won’t get far if you don’t know how to harness it’s power.

When you are able to determine these times when the risk of holding stocks (especially volatile penny stocks) is greatly reduced only then will be able to profit consistently. The average person has no idea about how the market “really works” and that is why traders who are informed, are able to take advantage of these people.

Unlike many other things in life where practice makes perfect and over time you can become success, the biggest challenge about trading is that you can literally go years and years and never get anywhere if you don’t either come up with your own trading system (which takes a serious amount of time) or adopt somebody else’s which fits well with your personality, and make it your own.",2

Just using my self as an example, I have a Netflix account but probably will cancel soon since streaming from free websites is still just as easy as actually using Netflix.  Plus I don't know what other huge innovations could come from a company that only streams video, besides them just producing more original content.  

Anyways, are there any good ETFs that either focus solely on these 3 (FB, AAPL, and GOOG)?  Another interesting thing to look at would be ETFs that are mostly comprised of these 3 but then have additional other companies in the mix.

16-04-09,4e3gvh,"As promised, RLYP DD","RLYP's bae is called Veltassa, which binds to potassium so it can be excreted. High levels of potassium result in [Hyperkalemia] (http://www.medicinenet.com/hyperkalemia/article.htm). Untreated Hyperkalemia can ""cause suppression of electrical activity of the heart and can cause the heart to stop beating.""

There are a bunch of fairly common drugs that can [inhibit excretion of potassium] (http://www.medicinenet.com/hyperkalemia/page4.htm). 
&gt;Examples of medications that decrease urine potassium excretion &gt;include:
&gt;    ACE inhibitors,
&gt;    ARBs,
&gt;    NSAIDs,
&gt;    potassium-sparing diuretics such as:
&gt;       spironolactone (Aldactone),
&gt;       triamterene (Dyrenium), and
&gt;       trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim).

&gt;Even though mild hyperkalemia is common with these &gt;medications, severe hyperkalemia usually do not occur unless &gt;these medications are given to patients with kidney dysfunction.  

So patient X is overweight, likely has constricted blood vessels and possibly diabetes. Patient takes ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and NSAIDs, to thin his blood and dilate blood vessels, but over time those cause potassium to build up in the blood resulting in Hyperkalemia (essentially, in order to save your heart and blood system, your kidneys take one for the team). So in comes Veltassa to save the day, offering an agent that binds to potassium and can be excreted along with the Veltassa. Yay. 

So here comes the FDA to spoil the gainz. 
(Here on we're going from the [10K] (http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1416792/000156459016013394/rlyp-10k_20151231.htm)

The likely reason for the label restricting use of Veltassa was from a study looking if it bound to agents other than potassium used in other drugs. They found that when the following 3 drugs were taken at the same time as Veltassa, 

- Ciprofloxacin (antibiotic)
- Levothyroxine (thyroid hormone replacement)
- Metformin (antidiabetic) 

the active agents in those drugs had ""reduced absorption (AUC)"" and ""reduced peak concentration (C max )"". However, no problems were found if the time span between ingestion of drugs was increased to 3 hours. So, the FDA's labeling guideline of 6 hours wait is likely due to a qualitative judgement of erring on the side of caution. 

But the problem is that both the antidiabetic and thryroid hormone replacement drugs are likely to be used by the largely overweight population that take the drugs that over time cause the hyperkalemia that would qualify them for...Veltassa. So...Fuck. 

Six hour wait is not an unreasonable request for doctor, but there will likely be many doctors who judge their patients as unreliable enough to take the guidelines seriously--they either don't care and take them at the same time, or they forget to take one of the drugs. 

~~~~~~~~~

Ok, so regarding the big fat elephant tapping its foot over at stage-left, AstraZeneca ZS-9, awaiting approval from the FDA on [May 26] (http://www.bioworld.com/content/relypsa%E2%80%99s-potassium-bid-veltassa-weighed-against-zs-pharma-contender-be). Basically, it all hinges on the labeling. I highly doubt that ZS-9 will be used in emergency situations, its not even close to fast enough. I also doubt the ZS-9 will pass without its own labeling restrictions. It too is a binder, so could catch necessary agents within its net, plus the use of sodium in ZS-9 counteracts the benefits of all the blood thinners and blood vessel dilating drugs. I would be remiss not to link the [original RLYP DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3rtod7/rlyp_dd_nasdaq_1887_48_months_75150/) from /u/Nexcapto here. 

Overall, I doubt ZS-9 will pass restriction-free, and there is real possibility of greater restrictions. 

~~~~~~~~~

Regarding Veltassa's first reported sales, I don't have much to add that others haven't covered. 
[1] (http://seekingalpha.com/article/3959242-relypsa-market-impressed-february-numbers) 
[2] (http://finance.yahoo.com/tumblr/blog-relypsa-the-bearish-case-explained-by-a-bull-175155395.html)

Ultimately, I think with such a short launch period, all this analysis and modelling just results in torturing data. I think we're going to have to wait till the next ER to get a good sense of the market's response. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Regarding buy-out, I wouldn't really expect a buy-out any time before FDA's decision on ZS-9. A partnership is more plausible in the near-term, but still unlikely before that decision. Presuming ZS-9 has comparable or greater restrictions, RLYP would likely get at least a partnership. I also doubt that they will move to other financing options before that. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finally, Here is the latest [investor presentation] (https://www.veracast.com/bio/ceoinvestor2016/main/events/2212_relyps/pdf/Relypsa__Inc._%28NASDAQ__RLYP%29.pdf)
I don't have anything to really add about the presentation, except that for some reason I couldn't find it on RLYP's investor relations page--I had to trawl through SeekingAnAlpha articles to get this pdf link.  

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I am setting a Hold for RLYP with a time frame of 6 months. The current rumors have increased SP, but not to the level that it would rise in the event of a partnership or buyer. I also suspect that speculation about ZS-9 may be depressing RLYP's SP--if as expected ZS-9 receives no labeling advantage, RLYP will rise. The lack of information about success of sales precludes a Buy rating at this time. 

Edit: Did you know that words can be hard?

Edit 2: I have no position in this. I do not intend to have one until ER and sales data at least. ",13

Is this worth 96,000?  I looked up the stock and it says 32.37 per share?

Could she own other stocks but not get a dividend check? How could I find out?

Should I just leave things as is or should I get my name put on them like I did with her checking account (I have been on her checking account for 10 years now) 

She also gets a Monthly payment from a life insurance company -- I have no idea why. 

She also owns her own condo , should I get put on the deed? She is going to move in with me should I rent it or sell it?

16-04-09,4e3lqm,Large Dutch bank ABN Amro trades for less than its book equity value - is this common for banks?,"Hi,

I was reading the 2015 Annual Report of ABN Amro (http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/ABN:NA) when I realised that its book equity of 17.584 billion is more than its market cap of 16.704 billion. The bank recently IPO'd after being taken private by our government following the onslaught of the 2008 financial crisis. Is it normal for a bank to have less market cap than its book equity? If yes, do interest rate fluctuations play a large role in this? ABN Amro relies mostly on mortgages which should provide little interest rate risk. In addition, it seems very unlikely for the bank to fail again anytime soon. How can its market cap be so low, when looking at its book numbers?",1

Caveat: Admittedly, I understand that the checking account is insured by the FDIC, and the dividend stock is insured by the devil himself. :)",2

Instead, you come in and 3 out of the top 5 threads, 5 out of the top 15, are ""I'm ##years old and make this much money, tell me what to do with it""

Post that in the daily advice thread where it belong so the front page is filled with good information and news and learning opportunities. Then read those threads and learn how to invest.

Sorry for the rant. I do think that there can be very good information in those threads based on advice people are giving but have it all in one spot, instead of clogging the front page with 5 identical questions. This way we can have room for what everyone wants to hear about, more SUNE posts!!

Last summer I heard rumblings about Valeant Pharmaceuticals, upon looking into its purchase price of $230 and really 0 research into anything about them I went 100% into it. Immediately the next day it went to $220, just my god dam luck. Getting emotional I put a sell price for $229 and forgot about it. Next time I looked I was sold out cause the bastard was up to $262. I wasnt that pissed in the next month when the legal troubles hit them, I lost some cash and some potential, but If I wouldve waited another month I would have jumped out a window.

This one is my favorite to work with even though some people think its foolish, ive made some good money on this in the spring and begining of summer, usually in Aug is when it takes a turn back down. Last year I pushed it into Sept cause it kept rising and I was making money and did 1100 @ $12.15. Then it turned on me, I ignored the 20% rule, and rode that pig down to $3.50/share. At that point I said id rather lose all the money then sell at such a loss. Their debt and rig count scares me, but fuck it im too deep anyways. The loss helped with capital gains, but tied that money up for too long.",4

16-04-11,4e8dmb,Commission fees draining portfolio.,"Hi,

I'm fairly new at investing, so I have a few questions. I put in a little amount of money into a brokerage account, and bought a few shares. Now my problem is that the stocks I bought need to increase in price a lot for me to make back the amount I spent on the commission fee. I bought 1 single Vanguard ETF, and that alone had a commission fee of 13 USD.

A refinery based in Rotterdam is waiting for a crude oil cargo to be delivered in June 12. The refiner will pay the monthly average of PATTS fixings for Brent reference in June 12.
The refinery will produce during the same month 100 000 barrels of gasoline with this crude oil.
The refinery sells forward, for December 12, the same amount of gasoline to a gas-station network based in the USA. The buyer will pay monthly average PLATTS fixings for gasoline quoted in New York Harbor (NYH) in December 12. 
Buy and sell are done at same time.
Forward curves for Brent swaps, gasoline crack spreads (Product– Crude price) and geographical spread between NYH and Rotterdam (NYH - Rotterdam price) are given below, as of the transaction day :
            
 | Brent swaps (usd/bl) | Gasoline Crack spread at Rotterdam (usd/bl)	 | Spread NY Harbour/Rotterdam (usd/bl)

2) Should a US based company buy a foreign company (in a country with lower tax rates), does the foreign company maintain its tax status as long as the profits stay within that country, or will it be taxed at the US tax rate?

3) Tax Inversions going forward. Can these still occur? From what I understand the acquired foreign business must make up at least 40% of the pro-forma business to qualify. How do they work? What can companies do going further to invert? Also, earnings stripping--is that just dead in the water now?

16-04-11,4e8ywp,Noob Question,"Hello!

I am relatively new to investing and I'm aware of the inherent risks of investing in penny stocks. With that being said I still feel like I'm missing something with Carbon 3d.

I'm sure most of you who trade in penny stocks are already aware of this company. Their symbol is CABN and they are currently trading for .0066 per share last I saw on Fidelity. 

The company itself seems to be making relatively important deals for R&amp;D among other things with companies like Google, Kodak and Johnson and Johnson. With the potentially revolutionary CLIP 3D technology and all these deals with reputable companies, why is the value of this stock so low?

I saw they had a small market of around ~2 million. The company has only been around for a few years and the profits don't seem to be there yet.

You guys/girls are far more versed in the penny stock world than I am so I'll get to the point with my questions. 

What are the major factors keeping this stock so low? And in anyone's experience have you ever seen an actual pink sheet traded stock make its way on to the NYSE (aka trading at $5+)?

This stock fucking blows harder than car eyelashes, but here we go regardless. 

""[Return Of The Bagholder $AVXL](http://imgur.com/qzXbmDH)""

Backstory: 
This stock saw some huge action last year with the possibility that Anavex's 2-73 drug could lead to helping patients with alzheimer's disease by targeting sigma one receptors, and removing plaque buildup on neurons that is believed to be the cause of alzheimers. Many people however boarded the possibility of a breakthrough, and believed the last data results were for effectiveness, and not safety. Disapointment and shorts ran in after, and the stock sank faster than the titanic.

This is the most recent news on the drug 2-73, and I link to it because the entire article is pretty important as a [whole.](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/anavex-announces-two-clinical-extension-120000501.html)

And here is the bad news about AVXL that again is written pretty [completely](http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/04/06/anavex-life-sciences-stock-1-key-number-you-must-k.aspx?source=yahoo-2&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=yahoo-2)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

However according to user Bioboot2 on the yahoo message boards he says that 

 Allergan Paid $3.3 Billion for Heptares Phase 1b Drug (Only 28 patients), which begs the question just what is AVXL Worth?

Just hours after Allergan backed away from a $160 billion merger with Pfizer, the company has bounced back with a $3.3 billion licensing deal for global rights to a portfolio of drugs for neurological disorders from the UK's Heptares.

Here is what I think. AVXL has Phase 2a data in Alzheimers patients.and is worth MORE than Heptares. Here is why. Heptares has Phase 1b results that they reported in Feb 2016. However, it is not data showing improvement in cognition, only in 28 Healthy (not Alzheimers patients) and no evidence clinical efficacy, just evidence of brain activity in health patients.. NO COGNITIVE DATA. See details from Heptares Feb 2016 press release below....

The Phase 1b precision medicine study involved 28 healthy elderly subjects who received different doses of 
HTL9936 and was designed to test the effect of drug on measures of brain activity while simultaneously monitoring side effects.

In the study, HTL9936 exhibited robust and statistically significant changes in brain electrical activity measured using multiple electroencephalography (EEG) biomarkers relevant to cognition, including effects on the P300 evoked response potential (p=0.0052). These pro-cognitive effects were seen at low doses and low blood concentrations that were safe and well tolerated

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another user argues that

The Motley Fool article by Cory Renauer exhibits the same bias as many of the hit pieces that have come out over the past year or so.

The author complains about how slowly Anavex has moved over it's lifetime, but mentions nothing about how much has been accomplished recently now that Dr. Missling is at the helm, including how many very prestigious members have joined the Scientific Advisory Board.

Like all bashers he criticizes the AV2-73 P2a data for not being P3 data. The trial is accomplishing the goal for which it was designed - to look for signs of efficacy (not prove efficacy) and gather info tor the next trial.

He compares AVXL with it's much smaller accumulated deficit to BLUE and KITE, and acknowledges that they have Big Pharma partners, while complaining that AVXL doesn't have as many trials running. That's like saying your neighbor is much deeper in debt than you and has a rich relative giving them money, but look at the great car they drive.

He claims that Anavex issuing more shares will mean that current shareholders will end up with nothing. He conveniently neglects to mention that the market cap can go up far beyond any new shares issued causing the share price to increase substantially. So what is the potential market cap for an Alzheimer's drug that becomes the standard-of-care worldwide, not to mention for any other CNS diseases? I'm pretty sure they can issue a lot of shares and still have a share price closing in on triple digits.

Lastly he says that ""The company might be able to raise a decent amount of equity in the process, but hardly enough to commercialize 2-73 without a big partner. So far, no drugmakers with enough resources seem interested.""

Dr. Missling has stated that he plans to go the partnership route and not try to go it alone. So is this author sitting in on all of Anavex's meetings so that he's in a position to state conclusively that no Big Pharma is interested? 

It seems that AVXL has been misrepresented in the eyes of former shareholders, but I think the risk to reward ratio is too great for anyone to at least not keep their eye on it. With the recent orphan designation is recieved, irregardless of future sales, the FDA has added some legitimacy back to the company that had SEC subponeas and a mountain of attacks from shorts. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remember that:

”Americans are spending $226 billion annually to treat the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease, and other dementias, rather than the cause of this disease itself. That’s an endlessly frustrating revelation that if left unchecked, could pose a big threat to the healthcare system. According to the Alzheimer’s Association, Alzheimer’s disease could cost Americans $1.1 trillion by 2050. Expect some public funding to try to curb this figure going into public companies on the government's part. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upcoming catalyst. 

Data is supposed to be released on Anavex 2-73 in the near future think 2-3 weeks or less. If the results are good, this could play into more legitimacy, and hopefully a partner which would absolutely double the stock.

16-04-11,4ed2du,Oil stuff,"The oil market is wild at the moment. 

1. Dollar is dropping fast and about to break ""support"" if you believe in support with Forex.. I don't really, but 93-94 is still an important level with the Dollar (/DX). This should be something everyone is looking at if you are going to play oil or the market in general. Lower dollar=Bullish for oil. 

2. OPEC/Russia meeting April 17-20. In my opinion, they will come out saying they want to freeze but it won't actually end up happening. Oil will probably drop pretty fast after the meeting unless they say some really bullish shit. After meeting=Possibly bearish. 

3. Russia and Iran are still putting out higher output numbers, so even at a freeze at the current level, output is really high. Summer demand will help combat this but probably not enough to really affect the glut. Iran also really doesn't want to participate in a freeze for logical reasons. If you were leading their country you wouldn't want to either. So bearish. 

4. Possible credit crunches/bankruptcies could start to occur with U.S. small oil companies. Less oil producers=Bullish. 

5. Pay less attention to rig counts. Multiple charts exist around the web that show the decrease in rig counts hardly decreases production. Efficiency has grown over the years with technological advancement and a mass amount of rigs is not needed. 

6. Hedge funds. Watch what they do, their net positions long/short. You can find charts of their positioning online, and a guy named John Kemp from Reuters provides them. The rally that started in February was directly correlated with Hedge funds dumping their short positions. Almost fully dumping them/covering their positions. It's pretty helpful in making your own decisions. 

Honestly this is a sketch time to be making bets one way or another with the meeting coming up next week. If the dollar keeps dropping, a rally could very easily continue. That's what I will be watching.. 

I'll probably buy a little DWTI at the time of the meeting and then load up more if the meeting comes out bearish. Hope some discussion can occur down below. Might have missed some points.

EDIT: Here is an example of today's update on the Hedge Fund positioning. You can see they just increased their short positions a little bit. https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6eTBlk-tOtAMHpLcXhidDZ3R0I3azQ0VEFObTNHR0tuNktJ/view?usp=sharing",16

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has extended the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date for its review of the Oral RELISTOR (methylnaltrexone bromide) new drug application (NDA) by three months to July 19, 2016.  The FDA extended the action date to allow for a full review of Valeant's responses to recent information requests from the FDA.

Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing innovative medicines for oncology, with a pipeline that includes several product candidates in later-stage clinical development. Among the assets in its pipeline of targeted radiotherapy and molecular imaging compounds is AZEDRA™, an ultra-orphan radiotherapy candidate currently in a phase 2 study under an SPA. The Company's PSMA-targeted product candidates for prostate cancer include two small molecule imaging agents 1404 and PyL, and two therapeutic agents PSMA ADC, an antibody drug conjugate, and 1095, a small molecule radiotherapeutic. Progenics' first commercial product, RELISTOR® (methylnaltrexone bromide) for opioid-induced constipation, is partnered with and marketed by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.

I bought in after the PDUFA delay last week at $4.28 and today the market price is at $4.75. I'm planning on holding this hopefully to the $5.50-6 range. 

Of course do your own research before you make any decisions. ",21

16-04-11,4ed4zq,"What's the advantages of royalty trusts vs. bonds/dividend stocks?","Ok so I've been reading about these and I'm still puzzled why these are popular.

From what I can surmise, these are trusts that pay out dividends relative to the underlying commodity they have the rights to (typically oil and gas). As the gas is pumped out and sold, the unitholders receive a cut of the sale as a dividend.

However, as is evidenced by these charts:

https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:SDT 
https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE%3ACHKR

they predictably decrease over time, which makes sense because the trusts are finite in life, so they will reach 0 upon termination.

One question I have is, does the high yield ever really overcome the capital loss? Basically is the ""yield to maturity"" positive given the decreasing principle?

Isn't this just basically the same risk profile as a high yield junk bond, only with a guarantee to return zero principle on expiration instead of the original principle?

It sounds to me like this has all the risks of a junk bond with none of the upside. At least with a junk bond there's a chance of the principle skyrocketing if the company starts to perform better than expected. 

Does anyone have any insight into this?

16-04-11,4eb03l,YOLO $CPLP,"I discovered CPLP while searching for stocks with high dividend yields and guy was yielding over 30% when I found it. I was looking for a stock that wasn't a POS Pink Sheet, or some failing company, but was reasonably cheap. 

$CPLP has been in a decline for quite sometime, from a high of about $10, to currently $3.50. Although there is not a reason due solely to the company that I can find for this extensive decline. I believe the reason is a combination of factors, including the global slowdown, decline in oil (although this isn't an oil related company, but hey, the market isn't always what you expect), and one of it's larger partners HMM restructuring. 

HMM has successfully restructured and I didn't really expect them to go out of business anyway. Overall the company has positive cash flow although debt is a little high, and on a technical basis, the stock seems to have broken out over the last few weeks. 

This is a YOLO because when I discovered this gem, the yield was so high that the dividend alone could cover a monthly loan payment. So I took out a $30k personal loan where the first payment is after ex-div and bought shares of CPLP. Since then (about 2 weeks) it's up 5%, and continues to make a steady uptrend.

The only thing that is needed at this point for this to turn out perfectly, is for them to not cut the dividend. I think the market has already priced in a dividend cut, which is also part of the reason for the decline. So if that doesn't happen (I give it 50/50), and they continue to pay the historical dividend, this trade is going to be golden. With the stock appreciation, dividend payments, this whole thing should closed out 12 to 18 months. At that time I'll have a cool $30k in the bank, that I didn't even have to do ""work"" for. 

If they do cut the dividend, I'm already up 5%, so I'll just sell the stock, repay the principle, and bank what it's appreciated since I bought it. 

YOLO.

16-04-11,4edb9l,Opinions on Fantex - Investing in sports athletes,"Hey all, I stumbled across Fantex about a year ago and it seems like the company has started to gain a little bit of traction. They now have 10 players and have created several tracking stocks for each athlete. Basically how it works is when you purchase a share of an athlete, you have a claim to a % of their income they make. You are essentially betting that the player will perform better than ""the market"" suggests. When an athlete has an IPO they receive a lump sum payment, which is attractive because their livelihood is tied to their health and performance. Future earnings for an athlete have high upside/high downside risk.

Now there are definitely some flaws in the system. I looked at the prospectus and there is a 5% management fee, 1% transaction fee, and other fees up to 2% on top of that! The income must be related to an athlete's sport - you get paid if Kobe signs a shoe deal, but if he stars in a movie you do not have a right to that income.

I do not think this is a surefire system by any means, but I am interested in seeing what you guys think about it. If it is legal to create a security like this, where can we go from here? I'm not saying I want to invest in something like this, but I am curious where the community thinks alternative investments like this will go in the next 10-20 years",3

16-04-11,4ebcnn,Credit default Swap questions from the movie The Big Short,"so I just saw the big short last night and I have some questions about the movie and credit default swaps in general. I actually have a degree in finance so no need for any dumbed down real world examples (for example I saw one earlier where someone tried to explain cds using horse racing).  I currently work in corporate finance, so while I have a good high level understanding of everything in the movie from my college courses, there are still some specific details I would like to have filled in. Below are my questions, feel free to answer as many or as few as you like. Thanks

1)      How did Jared Vennett &amp; Duetsche profit from selling the swaps? I understand he probably gets some kind of fee for being the sales guy on them but big picture how is he making himself and his bank money (the cherry on top he referenced in the movie) if the loans defaulted? If he was selling them for Duetsche wouldn’t that mean that Duetsche would be screwed when they all defaulted, having to pay up? Or was he simply a middle man to help sell the swaps being backed by another bank? That way the other bank is on the hook when the loans default?

2)      How are prices on the contracts determined? I’m having trouble following the whole ordeal where all the characters were frustrated that the prices for their positions had not increased. It seems that the prices should have immediately gone up when default rates rose. Are the banks who sold the swaps the ones determining the price? So what eventually caused the swaps to become correctly priced?

3)      Explain how the banks got themselves into a short position as Michael Burry says on the phone to the Goldman’s representative. Who was still selling default swaps to allow the banks to get in that position and why?

4)      Why did all of the protagonists in the film sell their positions? Why not hold them until you get the full pay out? Especially once they heard there would be a bail out?

5)      So who was purchasing the credit swaps from the protagonists? Was it the banks who issued the default swaps themselves to avoid having to pay out the full value?

6)      Did any of the protagonists actually own the bonds they were shorting or they all simply purchased the default swaps on bonds they had nothing else to do with?

7)      How does the payment of the premiums on the swaps work? Is it a fixed amount each month or is it based on the value of the swap? So that again would bring up how the value of the swap is determined. Then how does all this change once loans start defaulting?

8)      Are the payouts on these swaps determined by each individual loan that goes into default? For example, say the mortgage bond in question is made up of 100 mortgages. Then one single mortgage of the 100 mortgages goes into default. Now that bond is obviously not going to pay out the full amount it should. Does the seller of the swap have to payout the value of the one mortgage that went into default to the buyer or does that one default just affect the total value of the bond and the seller doesn’t have to make any payments until a maturity date?? I’m just confused at how and when exactly the buyer would get their money out of the swap and how that is determined? ",6

My family is the process of submitting the paperwork to claim my great uncles unclaimed assets in Florida. A few years ago we found there was approximately $428 cash balance of assets in ""UNDERLYING SHARES OR OTHER CER."" These Exxon assets were purchased in the 1960's when my great uncle was working for NASA. All of his immediate family has more or less passed away, and it's looking like we will have the necessary death certificates and documentation to make the claim as he was listed on my immediate uncle's birth certificate.

I think we're all curious as to what we could be looking at here in terms of potential assets. I understand Exxon stock has split numerous times over the years, and has grown exponentially over that time. Does anybody have any indication of what we could be looking at here? I'd imagine $428 of Exxon stock purchased in the 1960's could be worth some serious coin. There's some speculation that these could be penny stocks as well, and I'm not sure what that would mean either. Thoughts?

Any other advice, or suggestions when pursuing this? My family is claiming that whatever it ends up being, will be split amongst the 8 siblings evenly.",1

Anyways, They haven't been doing too fucking well lately. Their revenues (aka moneys that they make from peddling their shit) have been decreasing and their operating costs (aka moneys that the incompetent management spends on ""improving"" their dumpster fire) have been increasing. 

That's fucking bad, but, again, that's beside the fact. 

They have $22MM cash on hand, cold, hard, liquid cash. They is good because in the case of a buyout or some shit, we get cash value + a premium for the share... so we're making money. 

BUT, even that's not *really* important. 

Put the incompetent management aside, their nice cash value, their decreasing revenues and increasing operating costs ***ASIDE*** and listen to me. 

There's RED FLAGS everywhere when you read their 10-Q, shit like: (I'm paraphrasing here)

&gt; If our customers leave, we're fucked, 2 customers buy 65% of their disks

&gt; We're not innovating anymore so people don't want to buy our shit

&gt; This technology is obsolete, only some people buy it

&gt; The ""Sapphire Class Wafer"" market (is that a thing) is apparently really ""volatile"" so their revenues fluctuate

&gt; The demand for their glass disks are declining, which is bad

&gt; The price to make this shit is like almost the same they sell it for

&gt; This shit is competitive an we're some fucking incompetent company that can't manage our shit and we're being beat out by bigger producers because nobody gives a buck about some 17.2MM market cap company selling glass Frisbees.

&gt; ***THEY FUCKING SELL GLASS FRISBEES WITH LITTLE LIGHTS IN IT***

#BUT... LET'S PUT THAT SHIT ASIDE. 

Because this company is a dumpster fire, people are selling this fucking piece of shit company because nobody wants to hold these shares because... well.. they're worthless pieces of shit!

Anyways, because people are selling these like $5.00 hookers sell themselves the RSI (Relative Strength Index) is lower than 20. 

This means this fucker is **OVER-SOLD**. 

Well, /u/phonyamerican... what does that mean?!

IT MEANS THAT YOU CAN PICK THESE FUCKERS UP ON THE CHEAP. People are going to realize that this company isn't **THAT** bad (JK it really is) and bid the share price back up. 

Plus these shares are worth ~25% more in CASH alone, so you pay like $0.68 for a share worth like $0.85 in cash. That's not even their inventory or anything else (their assets). 

So...

* These $0.68 shares are worth $0.85 in cash the company has

* This company is oversold and **ripe** for a bounce

* Pick these shares up on the cheap and ride it out

* This company is a fucking piece of shit but fundamentals don't matter. Yellen is a piece of shit but she pumps the shit outta the economy more than anything else in the world. 

Yeah... So feel free to ask questions or critique my write-up, I'm happy to hear it. I also welcome opinions.

&amp;nbsp;

Market Overlook 4/11 - 4/15/2016

&amp;nbsp;

This week the S&amp;P 500 and the overall markets are resting inside of a three week consolidation. With the large number of recent Fed meetings as well as more upcoming meetings, it seems the markets are being pulled in both directions. The S&amp;P has hit highs of 2,075 and until it can break the 2,080 level it is still in an overall bearish trend. The key for this rally to turn into a reversal is for 2,072-75 to become support instead of resistance. From there the markets will be able to move forward.
April markets are in full swing and I expecting to see normal to higher than average volume in the coming weeks as building excitement into earnings season. This season we should expect a number of disappointments around the market with a few key exceptions. Retail is an area with a number of overbought stocks that are just asking for reality checks.
We were treated to a number of Fed talks last week, and as usual, nothing happened.The Fed was not very aggressive at all. In fact, they expect less growth and inflation. The Fed still projects for there to be two rate hikes in 2016. I belief and have for sometime that the Fed has far less effect on the market than they believe they do.  When you consider the only interest rate they actually have access to is the Fed Funds rate, which is exceptionally short term, it’s pretty interesting that they feel they can influence 30 year deliverables with their inaction.  The actual market reaction to Fed leader Yellen shows any market sentiment changes caused by a “Fed Talk"" is temporary.  These can provide some exceptional opportunities for nimble traders to profit from these market extremes.  I hope any Fed news this week causes just as much two-sided action as always.

&amp;nbsp;

This is my short list on things I am following and watching for in the week ahead.

&amp;nbsp;

SPX http://imgur.com/WjcIYFw

&amp;nbsp;

For SPX I think we are seeing a few critical things here. The very first is that the market is still in a bearish trend overall. Which is odd given the last few weeks. But since the all time highs we have seen lower high patterns and despite this recent run up we came up short. Market can’t seem to break the 2,080 levels continuing the bearish pattern. If you look closely we also have an overall lower lows pattern as well. We have not retraced that much so I would not call it a break just yet. The technical analysis here is pretty neutral as well. We have a lot of conflicting indicators. The first thing that looks bullish is the moving averages, In the chart you can see we have the 10 (green) and the 20 (orange) above the 200 SMA (dark blue). In addition the 50 (red) is really curling up now. What sets me off about the moving averages are that the 100 SMA (light blue) is still below the 200 SMA (dark blue). If you look back there has not been one sustained rally since the 100 SMA broke under the 200 SMA. If we also look at some of the indicators they are not looking that great either. The MACD is sloping down however, it is still above the 0 line and still has some decent divergence. The stochRSI is looking bearish. While it is oversold and can move to overbought, most decline will remain oversold for several days, so until it crosses above the 20 line, it is bearish. For SPX we need to look for two key areas for support at resistance. Look for support at the 200 SMA and resistance at 2,080.

&amp;nbsp;

Here are a few things I’ve seen from a Tech analysis in Commodities.

&amp;nbsp;

Up first Oil /CL http://imgur.com/gqk3Gs7

&amp;nbsp;

From a technical analysis standpoint, oil is looking decently bullish overall.(FA on oil says we should be at $30 a barrel, but as traders/investors we play what the market is telling us and its clear the market wants oil above $36 for now…)If you look at the MACD is moving to cross above the 0 line and the stochRSI is moving up bullishly. It's moving to pass the 80 line where it would be able to really breakout. Oil was obviously in a massive downtrend and I am not calling a bottom. The upside I do think however is limited and a bigger short opportunity may be presenting itself. If we look closely, oil has been getting rejected at the 200 SMA (dark blue lines, circled area) all year long. It hasn't been able to break at all and was even rejected quite recently. With the bullish indicators it looks like a test for the 200 SMA is quite possible. Just keep in mind there really isn't anything fundamentally bullish about oil, it just looks good on a TA level.

&amp;nbsp;

Up next /NG: http://imgur.com/wnoksut

&amp;nbsp;

Natural Gas has been in a long uptrend and is looking quite bullish. It has been a ""buy the dip"" type of commodity lately. There are a few bullish things to notice here. The first is that the fast moving averages are all trending up. The 10 SMA (green) crossed the 20 SMA (orange) and just crosses the 50 SMA (red). The 20 SMA is heading towards the 50 right now as well. In addition, all three of those moving averages are sloping up and are heading for the 100 SMA (light blue). The MACD is well above the 0 line along with the fast MA above the slow MA. The stochRSI is also still quite bullish. It is heading for overbought which could let allow for it to come down to oversold but if you look back, all of its biggest runs are while its overbought.

&amp;nbsp;

While /NG is looking quite bullish I do have one significant concern. The main area of concern is the circled area. If you look closely, the setup is extremely similar. In the previous setup, the 10 crossed the 20, and then later crossed the 50. The 20 was heading for the 50 and then ended up breaking it; however, it was rejected quick and made new lows.

&amp;nbsp;

The chart is showing that we are now in a very similar setup as we are approaching the 100 SMA (light blue). It was previously broken but came down very quick and was rejected the next time it was faced. In addition, /NG is currently in a wedging pattern. You can see the movement is narrowing down and an outbreak is due soon. With all this adding up, it makes sense that NG would be in an outbreak pattern. Breaking the 100 SMA will be crucial to continue the trend up; otherwise, expect some decent movement to the downside. (Don’t forget warmer weather is on its way and could/will affect  /NG)

&amp;nbsp;

Last but not least that shiny stuff...Gold /GC http://imgur.com/SY7dvD5

&amp;nbsp;

From a technical analysis standpoint, gold is looking bullish here as well. There are a lot of bearish bets being placed on gold and gold miners; however, it has been showing strong support and has not broken support since the recent run-up. Not only that, we also have every single moving average now above the 200 SMA which is very bullish. In addition, we have recently had a wedge pattern break. There was a lot of downward pressure to the support but it had a big breakout towards the upside out of the wedge. With the MACD above the zero line and the stochRSI trending bullish, it looks like gold wants to run on this breakout. If it can bounce off the support of the breakout area it could start to make some real moves towards the 52 week highs. Gold seems to be potentially channeling so do not expect new 52 week highs without some sort of a catalyst. I also think gold is being helped by a overall “mood” of uncertainty still. 

&amp;nbsp;

Things to look for  in the week 4/11 - 4/15/2016
This week the biggest thing to look for is whatever comes out of the closed door Fed meeting. This was an unexpected meeting they say is under ""Expedited Procedures”. This meeting is going to be on Monday and they will be discussing rates. No conclusions can be drawn from this per se; and for reference, the last time this occurred the rates were raised roughly one month later.

April expiration is two weeks away. It’s time to think about rolling your short options to the next cycle in May to collect some more premium and reduce your delta risk.   Volatility has made a bit of a comeback as of Friday, but it’s more of a rumor at this point compared to the all-star stage-show it will be when it really comes back to play. And as a derivatives trader I have but one thing to say...Long live Volatility!! Bring me back to the promise land!

16-04-12,4ee4ua,FSLR DD and speculation,"1. First solar has a conservative and vertically integrated strategy that has yielded quarter after quarter sales growth. They build the panels, install, operate, and sell the power.

2. Competitors are under bidding one another in a race to the bottom to compete and running it debt hurting the market with the current tech available, however first solar has a new mono-Chrystal technology that will greatly increase panel efficiency and decrease manufacturing costs that was announced in the past days. It is not expected that anyone will be able to compete with FSLRs technology for 2 to 4 years while competition scrambles to develop. First solar say no production of new panels for sales until 2017 / 2018...keep reading - I suspect this is BS and they are ahead of schedule.

3. Prooven record of under promising and over performance, beating expectations  in the last 4 quarters. Increasing sales and panel efficiency year after year

4. Rated by experts as a buy, outperform, or hold. Goldman Sachs and others advise value at $100 to $75 a share. Yet bearish market has FSLR currently trading at $60 on lack of guidance on 2017 growth and no announcement of capacity increases, also COO Philip Dejong sold some 6k share recently. 

5. I belive this is a set up and the stock is set to rebound. Here's why:

  A. I happen to know (due to my proximity in the mfg industry) that first solar has invested in 9 new, highly automated manufacturing lines which are being comissioned now - this is a direct contradiction to the ""no planned capacity increases"" that have investors bearish

  B. Significant investment activity by Nation wide, and other large investors in FSLR. Including COO Philip Dejong. 

  C. Track record of playing it conservative and keeping performance expectations on the DL - they know what they are doing

  D. Under valued by experts and a strong Financials with prooven record

  E. Putting 2 and 2 together - The new manufacturing line will be capable of making the new style panels, and decreasing the $ per Watt of solar energy to obliterate the competition. Why else would they want to keep this news hush hush? Keep the competition off guard? Intentionally devalue the stock for investors? Okay. I am a conspiracy theorist, but with a valuation of $100 per share currently  at $60 with solid company fundamentals and past performance, it's still good for long hold on the face. And if my hunch is right this has real upside in the nearer future.

Genocea indicated that it will meet with the FDA for its ""end-of-Phase II"" meeting in the first quarter of 2017. Phase III is expected to start in mid-2017.

1 estimate has been raised since the company released the results but 4 are up in the last 60 days.

The 2016 Zacks Consensus Estimate has risen to a loss of $1.73 from a loss of $1.89 in the last 60 days.

16-04-12,4eepx3,What does more in depth analysis on Yahoo reveal that causes the lower value?,"Doing a quick look at Yahoo's ownership of Alibaba and Yahoo Japan, I [find](http://imgur.com/NHy2ekX) the two are currently valued at about $29.8B and $9.09B. Assuming the same shares are owned as on Dec 2nd, 2015 according to [this article](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-12-02/yahoo-is-looking-for-a-new-way-around-alibaba-taxes). First flaw is its an iffy source and could be out of date.

If we assume that's right, and assume yahoo's core business is worth $0 then that's $38.9B book value. Right now the market cap is $34.4B, which is lower than the assumed book value when we considered the core is worth $0.

I know Yahoo hemorrhages money, so that would make sense on being under book value. Similarly, when losing money they could sold some shares to raise capital, although I couldn't find anything saying they sold shares. Maybe it doesn't have to be publicly disclosed so I can see that being the case. Also, the taxes incurred when selling Yahoo Japan and Alibaba could be the cause and this seems most likely to me.

With the discussions on their core business being up for sale for a non zero amount, I'm interested if anyone here has found a probable cause. It could also just be my thought process is missing something key.",2

16-04-12,4egxof,Upcoming proposal in an annual meeting,"I was hesitant to put the stock ticker in the title because I know its polarizing, but regardless of how we felt/feel collectively about Sigma Labs (SGLB/SGLBD), I was hoping I could ask some questions about an upcoming company proposal at the annual meeting.  I don't normally participate in these votes, but I first received a personalized email asking me to review the proxy materials and vote, and when I didn't respond, I received a personal phone call, asking if I would review the materials and vote.  The guy even offered to generally tell me what the proposals were while we were on the phone.

I have since had time to review the materials, and everything looks reasonable to me except for the third proposal:

&gt; PROPOSAL III - APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT TO AMENDED AND RESTATED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION TO INCREASE OUR AUTHORIZED COMMON STOCK

This proposal asks to increase shares by 750,000,000, from 750,000,000 to 1,500,000,000.  This seems like it will create an incredible amount of dilution, but the company addresses this:

&gt;As is true for shares presently authorized but unissued, the future issuance of common stock authorized by the amendment may, among other things, decrease out existing stockholders' percentage equity, ownership and, depending on the price at which they are issued, could be dilutive to our existing stockholders, and have a negative effect on the market price of the common stock.

But goes on to say

&gt;Our Board of Directors believes the amendment is necessary and advisable in order to maintain our financing and capital raising flexibility in connection with our working capital needs and to generally maintain our flexibility in today's competitive and fast-changing environment.  Other possible business and financial uses for the additional shares of common stock include, without limitation, future stock splits, acquiring other companies, business or products in exchange for shares of common stock, attracting and retaining employees by the issuance of additional securities under our equity compensation plans and other transactions and corporate purposes that our Board of Directors deems to be in the Company's best interest.  The additional authorized shares would enable us to act quickly in response to opportunities that may arise for these types of transactions, in most cases without the necessity of obtaining further stockholder approval and holding a special stockholders' meeting  before such issuances could proceed...""

**Is this normal for a tiny stock like this?  Should I be worried about the immediate future?**

**Not submitting a vote results in an automatic vote in favor of the amendment, why would they spend so much effort to contact me unless if they were trying to rally votes against the proposal?**

Everyone must be waiting on guidance and 2nd half outlook. 
IMF just lowered Global Growth rate for 2016, 2017 by another .1%, and a few points in China. How many more bumps lower are we going to see?

What will bring down bank stocks further? Will the news that they lost ONLY 6% this year, compared to 2015 JUMP the stock and the market as a whole? Will slashed guidance have the opposite effect?

Or is the market playing a fools game right now? This rally is like a bunny hop it doesn't make sense. Earnings are down, so markets go up... of course until earnings that everyone knows are dog shit actually report tomorrow, and then the entire sector will drop?

I believe Oil is also driving this rally. However, the jenga board just seems very-VERY unstable. Like it could fall at any minute.

16-04-12,4eeyzp,"Overview of Apparel Companies(ANF, GPS, GES, URBN)","Introduction to some metrics used for analyzing apparel companies. The metrics are easy to understand for most people and it should make for a quick read.

Same Store Sales/Comparable Store Sales: For apparel companies (and a plethora of other consumer companies as you'll see) you'll be tracking monthly sales metrics by store across all geographies. This data is available on a monthly basis. **Note same store sales figures are on a monthly basis so if you work in consumer IBD get ready for those early morning releases

Sales Floor Performance Metrics: This is another easy one to understand, you're looking for outperformance relative to peers on the following metrics: Sales per square foot, average sale/customer, costs/sq foot. The metrics are exactly as they sound, you're looking for sales and cost efficiency on a per store basis and by geography as well. The most common of the three mentioned above is of course Sales/Sq foot. Finally, if you want to get into the nitty gritty of each product line you can ask specific stock to sales ratios of key product launches at the company (stock to sales simply being how many items of the new product were sold are in stock and were sold over the last quarter/month/year)

Online Metrics: This is even easier to understand! Any website (including a retail online store) is simply looking to monetize its online customer base by tracking the following: Average sale per customer, conversion rates - number of page views to sell product X or number of products sold after clicking on XYZ advertisement and of course the mix of items being sold split by gender/age range and product line.

Production Efficiency: Assuming the company you're looking at does the manufacturing of all the items (shirts/sweaters/shoes etc.) you can get into more detail by tracking manufacturing efficiency. If you order say 10,000 pairs of shoes and you have to create 11,000 of them your efficiency is 91% (this 9% adjustment reflects manufacturing errors/quality control issues).

Geographic Roll Outs: For larger companies, particularly international expansion, we want to track store growth rates, margin profile by geo and open to close ratios (number of stores opened in geo X versus number that were forced to close). Without digging too much into the details here, many consumer companies use debt to continue rolling out new stores in a particular geo. Easiest way to think about the process is as follows: Open store 1 with debt, wait for cash flow to turn positive, use remaining cash flow to fund opening of store 2... repeat process assuming stores turn cash flow positive within a reasonable time frame. Some stores will not hit the metrics, shut them down, go back to square one and roll out in a new geo or the same geo but different location.

Valuation: From a valuation range perspective you're looking at roughly 5-15x EV/EBITDA, 10-30x P/E and PEG's of 0.9-1.9 or so.

Summary: This is a great space to understand since it is older and easy to pick up if you're younger. In short the ideal apparel company is outperforming on all of the key retail metrics mentioned above and doesn't have any competitive issues (example NIKE recently competing aggressively with Lululemon Athletica). The ideal company would look something like this: 1) High sales growth relative to comps, 2) revenue/sq foot increasing, 3) OPEX/Sq foot decreasing, 4) Average sales per customer increasing, 5) manufacturing efficiency improving towards 100% (will never reach 100% of course), 6) online metrics improving purchase/page views and conversion rate on advertising.",2

Obviously, there is no guarantee of being able to pull this trade off consistently on a day to day basis.

Further, there would be short term capital gains.

I understand what all the words in the Investopedia article mean, but the exact mechanism is still completely opaque to me.

It refers to ""locking in"" unrealized capital gains on positions. How in the heck does that work? When the market goes up, you have gains, when it goes down, you have losses, both are unrealized, until you sell. How can you lock in gains without selling? This is my primary point of confusion.

Also, in what ways do cash deposits and share purchases affect SMA? I totally understand margin maintenance requirements. They make perfect sense to me, and I can do the math on them. I don't get how SMA works or understand how to calculate ahead of time how the purchase or sale of securities will affect my SMA balance.

I don't want an ""ELI5"" answer that oversimplifies this. I'm not afraid of math. I just want to truly understand this, and I don't feel like I do at this point.

The one that's on the cusp of FDA approval is called Probuphine and it's an implant that releases a 6 month steady dose of Buprenorphine. Have you heard of Suboxone? Same shit. It's used to treat opioid addiction, which is a hot topic these days. The CDC estimates that opioid addiction costs the US $25 billion a year- Obama hates that shit. So instead of giving you a 30 day supply of Suboxone, which you could sell, lose, forget to take, or get stolen, or maybe your kid or dog eats them all and ends up D-E-D ded, you go in and have a 10 minute procedure done to place this implant and boop- there's your suboxone for the next 6 months. Enjoy being a productive member of society. Also, your doctor won't have to see your bitch ass just to write you a new rx in a month. Whoo, this is some good shit. (Disclaimer: I've never undergone treatment for opioid addiction, so it probably doesn't work quite like that.)

So now that you have some background on the product, you should know that the FDA shot this shit down in 2013. They wanted more data. So Titan got them more data. They concluded phase 3 testing last June with [promising results.](http://www.drugs.com/nda/probuphine_150608.html) Now, nothing is a guarantee in the crazy biotech world, but the consensus seems to be that they're going to get that FDA approval on/before May 27th. When/If they do, they get an automatic $15mil payment from their daddy/partner Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, who owns the marketing rights in the US and Canada. Titan gets milestone payments up to $165mil based on sales, plus a percentage of US/Canada sales. And 100% of the sales outside of US and Canada. Oh and did I mention Titan is completely debt free? Yeah. And a few of their big wigs came from Bayer and Glaxosmithkline. That seems good.

Ok, this is getting long, let's wrap it up with a few more points. TTNP is up 44% in the past month and 25% just in the past 5 days. But don't worry, the train hasn't left the station yet, the PDUFA is still a month and a half away. I'm going to hold my 2,000 shares through the PDUFA because YOLO, but I think it's a great candidate to ride the hype train and dump it prior to the decision if you don't want to risk being like those APRI bagholders. If Probuphine is approved, it means the FDA is endorsing Titan's patented implant drug release tech and it will open the doors for future developments by Titan. Right now they are working through trials for two other implants: one for Parkinson's and one for Thyroid disease. I'm going to hold this shit and get a yacht. If you think this is just MNKD 2.0, feel free to watch me sail into the sunset (or short it), but now you can't say I didn't share. Go fuck yourselves.   

tl;dr YOLO your life savings into TTNP for 6 weeks. If you get fucked, /u/davepergola turned me on to this shit, so point your pitchforks that way.",18

16-04-13,4ejl5x,WSB Meet Kevin Tang of Heron Therapeutics. One of us,"Kevin Tang is one lucky dude.
 
Tang, the activist manager of the health care hedge fund Tang Capital Partners, has an unusual strategy: liquidate underperforming biotech companies. Here's how it works...
 
The credit crisis – and the ensuing risk-aversion – has driven investors miles away from small biotechs. When sellers far outnumber buyers, a strange phenomenon happens. These stocks get pushed below the amount of cash the companies have in the bank (a condition called ""negative enterprise value"").
 
In theory, if you buy the stock at these depressed prices, you can generate instant, guaranteed returns by shutting the company down and returning the existing cash to shareholders. For Kevin Tang, it's not theory. He puts it into practice.
 
Recently, Maryland-based Vanda Pharmaceuticals became Tang's prime target. The company had developed the drug Fanapt for schizophrenia. But the FDA rejected it last July, demanding more clinical trials. Shares fell from a high of $29 in 2007 to less than $1 after the rejection. Still, Vanda persisted. It believed it could convince the FDA to approve Fanapt without any new trials.
 
I thought the Vanda management team was either crazy or brilliant. I figured their chances of success were less than 1 in 1,000. Apparently, so did Kevin Tang.
 
Tang knew Vanda's stock was worth much more than $1. In fact, the company was sitting on about $1.70 per share in cash after accounting for all its liabilities. So he moved in and scooped up almost 4 million shares (15% of the company) at less than $1. Then, he demanded management close shop and return the cash to shareholders. If the strategy succeeded, he would be sitting on a 70% return in less than a year. But, boy, he couldn't have been more wrong...
 
On May 6, the FDA did the unthinkable. It approved Fanapt for schizophrenia, dropping its request for new trials. The agency's miraculous change of heart was shocking and unprecedented. The next morning, Vanda's stock jumped 920% at the open. Yes, you are reading it right – a ""10-bagger"" in a single day.
 
Tang's original stake of roughly $4 million is worth more than $50 million today. (And yes, he immediately withdrew his proposal to liquidate the company.)",23

Makes over a billion in todays money on his big short. His edge? He practically invented technical analysis. Ultimately loses it all, because that is just how he rolled, mother fucker. Key quote: ""Play the market only when all factors are in your favor. No person can play the market all the time and win.""

2. George Soros Starts an incredibly successful hedge fund. Bets against the bank of England in '92.  Makes over a billion dollars on his big short. His edge? He hired someone smarter than him (Druckenmiller), and then encouraged the guy to go for the jugular when his animal instincts said there was a sure kill. Key quote: ""There is no point in being confident and having a small position.""

3. John Paulson Starts a very successful hedge fund. Shorts the housing market in '08.  Makes over 3 billion dollars for himself, 15 billion total, on his big short. His edge? He hired someone smarter than him (Pellegrini)  and went balls to the wall with other peoples money when it seemed like they were on to something. Key quote: ""We found the El Dorado of investments. Are we going to just dip our toes in?""

To summarize, I would like to quote the god father of the YOLOr, Jessie Livermore one more time.

16-04-12,4ehvzo,DD on Neustar $NSR,"According to Reddit Search^^TM , the **BEST GODDAMN SEARCH ENGINE EVER WRITTEN,** no one has ever posted about NeuStar ($NSR) on this subreddit. So I'm going to give you a good short-term trade idea for your Robinhood accounts or high-school economics trading contests. 

**WHAT THE FUCK DO THEY DO**

They have government contracts to run certain Internet domains, they provide network security services, and they provide certain services to the cellular phone industry, the most important of which is related to number portability--a service that lets you fuckers switch cell phone providers without having to change your number. This currently nets them a cool $500 million a year in revenue--half their Benjamins.

**WHY THE FUCK IS IT DOWN SO MUCH**

A bit more than a year ago, they received word that they will not get to keep the $500 million per year number portability contract. To make up for the lost revenue, they are issuing debt to buy up companies. The timing of the number portability contract switchover is tentatively a bit less than a year and a half away (third quarter of 2017).

Two recent acquisitions, which both closed in December, were:

* Transaction Network Services, which authenticates phone users. This lets them identify people.
* MarketShare Partners, which provides marketing analytics. This lets them target potential customers.

The two acquisitions are intended to work together to help companies target marketing spend at known people.

The stock is frothy, and down from its highs, because no one knows if Neustar will succeed in their diversification efforts. It's hard to re-make a company so quickly, and if they fail they won't be able to pay off their $1 billion debt.

**WHY THE FUCK IS THE SHORT RATIO SO HIGH**

See above, under **""WHY THE FUCK IS IT DOWN SO MUCH""**. Also, this equity is thinly traded, making the short ratio higher compared to other companies with a similar ratio of shorts to float (40%).

**SO WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO**

Watch the calendar for their earnings announcement this quarter, which is the first quarter that will have full results from the two acquisitions that closed in December. If the new acquisitions post good numbers, and if they have anything interesting to say about the timing of the number portability contract end date, there could be a really big short squeeze. It's pretty clear the shorts haven't covered yet because volume hasn't picked up.

Another reason to keep an eye on this stock is because there is talk of Neustar being taken private. A well-timed purchase could result in a nice pop.

One more thing: Lisa Hook and Paul Lalljie, the CEO and CFO respectively, are buying shares and currently (as of March 1 of this year) have more than 630,000 shares between them, which is worth more than $15 million at today's price. So they're working hard to earn their yachts.

**WHY THE FUCK SHOULDN'T I BET THE FARM**

There's a lot riding on this company's next few earnings reports. A really bad report could send this equity to zero if the market thinks bankruptcy looms. (It doesn't help that the debt is junk-rated and variable interest rate.)

**WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOUR SOURCES**

I read the company's 2015 Annual Report and press releases.

**DO YOU HAVE SKIN IN THE GAME**

Based on my research, I bought 50 calls expiring in May at a strike of $27. I thought about just going long, but I know you fuckers like call options so that's what I went with. So it's go big or go home.

Sorry I couldn't put this up during market hours, it took me longer than I expected and I haven't even eaten lunch yet.

Good luck, and fuck off.",22

A lot of buzz around them here in Montreal because they're a local company. They have this new line of aircraft, CSeries, and are expected to announce a big deal with Delta soon. I've bought a few hundred dollars worth of calls. Nothing big but I'm hoping they'll be worth a few grand in a month.


The ticker is BBD.B and that trades on the TSE (TSX). 


They announced that some airline in Latvia or some shit bought 7 of the planes today and they flew 5%. Delta is expected to announce a purchase for (I think) 75 aircraft and an option for 25 more. 


Let it be known: it is possible this announcement never comes. If it does not, your (and my) options will expire worthless.


Good luck, have yolo. 


PS: Could also be a decent idea to just buy shares. They could easily double or more in the next 24 months if their new line of aircraft picks up. This company currently trades around $1.30 and there's precedent for them at like $22 when they were selling their regional jets to everyone

LNKD: Took a beating. Lots of fears. Yet sales grew 35% (!!) last year. Profits were hurt by more hiring and investment but that's a long term growth play. 35%. Sales grew by 35%. And while it isn't Facebook and never will be, Linkedin hasn't even begun to scratch the surface of how to monetize their product and data. Still hard to justify it's current valuation with current fundamentals but growth will get them there faster than most. Again, not a short term play, but a solid long term bet. Finally - I use Linkedin. Highly paid professionals I know and respect across various industries - tech, banking, investing, consulting, law -  use LNKD regularly. It's the go-to first step for recruiting (and dick measuring). Gut check 1: The need for a professional networking site is clear and Linkedin is the only player in the game.

BHP: Recently cut their long running dividend. Beat down from commodities/oil both of which will come back. They are in the definition of a cyclical market. BHP is huge, well run, conservative. Diversified. ""A"" credit rating, 10 years of increasing dividends before the recent cut, generally a stable player in an unstable market. Basically you're looking at the best miner in the world going through a perfect storm for its industry. They'll be fine. They'll recover. And in 3 years you'll have a ridiculous effective div yield on your investment at a much higher valuation.

I've generally done well making investments like this. Not all of them work out, but by diversifying across beat down stocks in diverse industries, I've been able to realize very healthy returns. The hard part is knowing when to sell. Typically, as the stock rises (this over multiple years, not weeks mind you) I'll take out the principal, let the gains ride, and put the principal into some other new rebound story. This is not a huge part of my portfolio (I'm very conservative overall) but perhaps it should be larger given how well it's done over the years.

Take it or leave it. Obviously I'm not the most ""technical"" of investors but just thought I'd share a few recent thoughts to see how this board reacts. Thanks.

EDIT: So just to reiterate, these are beaten down stocks and thus, by definition, not popular plays. Just thought I'd share a small part of my portfolio that I place in RISKIER stocks. I've done well in this SMALL PART of my portfolio in the past and thus decided to share here. If you don't like the stocks, then you're normal. Most people don't like these companies right now. Hence the declines. 

EDIT: Seems like this has gotten lots of downvotes. Maybe this type of post is not welcome here for some reason?

EDIT: Whelp. Maybe these should have been short term instead of long ;). I check my port this morning and LNKD up 3%, BHP up 7% and HSBC up 5%....LOL. Total coincidence and NOT the play I'm looking to make. Just thought it was funny given the timing of this post. Watch they all tank now... Thanks for the great comments!

16-04-13,4ek35i,$FNMA Developments (Semi-DD),"Hello WSBers, 

I have been checking this sub for quite some time now and decided I should stop being a fucking wall-flower and actually contribute something to the cause.

I started watching FNMA a while back as it presents such a unique situation that I don't believe has ever existed before in the market. Namely that the SP of an extremely profitable company is being artificially suppressed by the federal government.

I'm sure most are aware of the situation so I wont bore you with all the details of how shit went down.  If you don't know and can't find out; sorry this post is not for you.
The purpose of this post was to shed some light on recent developments surrounding some key lawsuits over the past month or so.


The defendant's (fed gov) current arguments have prevented discovery (collection of material evidence to be used in trial) in all of the previous court cases.  This was made possible by ""executive privilege"" where in double speak the gov basically argued that the twins were now gov entities.

This worked for a while until the chink in the armor was exposed; http://www.housingwire.com/articles/36442-fanniegate-9th-circuit-rules-that-fannie-and-freddie-are-private-companies


This ruling opened the door to be used for the other ongoing cases and allow discovery if granted by the judge.  What could they possibly find in this discovery.... well how about this gem;

Other than your typical shitty WSB biopharms and oil companies, AMBC stands out, as it's an underwriter rather than part of those two industries. It's got 41 mln in cash against 13 billion in long term debt, which isn't a great situation, despite having a large investment book (which seems somewhat weighted towards securities they guarantee). No short term or current long term debt yet, but it's clear there may be some issues.

The company is undergoing a long proxy fight with hedge fund Canyon Capital, which is attempting to gain control of the board, and appears to be faltering.

The risk to the company is their part of guaranteeing $24 bln of Puerto Rican bonds (source: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-11/as-puerto-rico-nears-record-default-insured-investors-rest-easy?cmpid=yhoo.headline) and, in addition (though more minor), they guarantee about 1.4 billion in student loans, which may cause problems as well. Most of their book is mortgage backed securities (which shouldn't have too many issues, though there seems to be some rumblings of an asset bubble there too), but the issues in Puerto Rico may cause issues.

I just shorted shares rather than played options as the liquidity kind of sucks and I don't really have a clear timeframe, but I believe there's some potential here as it's not a crowded trade (short is only ~7% of float).",3

16-04-13,4ele14,Huge difference between very similar companies?,"This is going to be a very noobish question, from a very nooby wannabe investor.

In Australia there are two main airlines, Qantas and Virgin Australia.

The stock price difference between these two (in my opinion) very similar airlines, is huge:

Qantas ($3.97) - https://www.google.com/finance?q=ASX:QAN&amp;ei=2DoOV7CuFcGT0ASb7bvwBg
Virgin Australia ($0.35) - https://www.google.com/finance?q=ASX%3AVAH&amp;ei=0zoOV_GkLYKR0gTkia6oBw

Why is there such a huge difference? Is it just because of the confidence people have in Qantas being one of the worlds longest running (and safest) airlines? Virgin is a huge brand, and is part owned by Singapore Airlines and Etihad, I would have thought it would be worth a lot more than it is?

Another question I have, Qantas's regional brand ""REX"", which does very little business in comparison, is trading at $0.71? How does that makes any sense?",2

Something I have become obsessed with has been with Argentina and their ability to be run counter cyclical to the rest of the world so successfully for the past 100 years. 
                  

http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21596582-one-hundred-years-ago-argentina-was-future-what-went-wrong-century-decline
               
From the article:     
""Indeed, one way to think about Argentina in the 20th century is as being out of sync with the rest of the world. It was the model for export-led growth when the open trading system collapsed. After the second world war, when the rich world began its slow return to free trade with the negotiation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1947, Argentina had become a more closed economy—and it kept moving in that direction under Perón. An institution to control foreign trade was created in 1946; an existing policy of import substitution deepened; the share of trade as a percentage of GDP continued to fall.""

In the last 20 years under Kirchner, Argentina largely missed out on the commodity boom created by China's rise due to protectionism and heavy agricultural subsidies while other local economies like Chile, Colombia and Peru were huge benefactors. 

Now that Argentina is coming out of its slump, and trying to reverse its protectionist policies, it is facing a world of slumping commodity prices, a slowing china, rising protectionism and slowing world trade. 

If Macri has a stronger mandate and Argentina goes full Chicago Boys Chilean style, I think a global depression and the rise of WWII style command economies is on the come. ",0

I'm torn between hold or sell or buy more... 

Initially we took about 19 stocks that were divided between dividends, longterm holds and some short term holds. We put small amounts into each stock to see how they perform. Our strongest stocks are, GOOD(+19%) PM(+21%) SO(+18%) KMB (+24%) GE(+24.2%) etc. But some of these dividends would take years to reach the current Unrealized P&amp;L on these in dividend payments. I'm not working with a huge sum of money but we currently avg 2.6% in dividends per year with our current portolio. 

I would like some advice on how to handle Dividend stocks that turn into heavy gainers.

16-04-13,4eoc3x,Apr 13th 2016,"Today was a great day! I woke up at the regular time of 7 am which is 7 hours ahead of eastern time. I jumped up brushed my teeth slammed a one scoop shake and headed to breakfast before the gym. I got egg whites as usual. They are delicious, I really can't describe how good they really are. Once I was finished, I headed out to the gym still feeling a little sore from the day prior doing heavy legs, back, and bis. But I pushed on my chest, shoulders and tri workout. I always enjoy doing about 10-15 min of cycling first to get the heart going. Finishing the workout with abs and running for 15 min on the treadmill. Cardio is always a must. I've been big in the past but couldn't run up a few flights of stairs without getting tired. 

I then headed my to the pad to take another shake and start some homework. The homework for online school is pretty simple and doesn't require much to complete just takes time. 

After lunch, I started to analyze the future charts for the s&amp;P e-minis. Always a great chart to look at. I could see on the 55min chart that that 55ma was about to cross the 233ma that was already in an uptrend direction. I knew today would be another up day for $spy.

I left and went to work at 2 pm, on the way to work I thought about how the $spy would gap up on the open and I would just need to wait for a pull back on the 1 min chart to buy some Apr calls. 

Work is kind of busy but dies down just as the market opens for me. I gave the E-mini chart one last look right before the open and could see that it had held on the support of the center Bollinger band on the 21 min chart and was going to make a buy signal on the open. I just simple patiently waited after the first candle was close on $spy. Moving over to the 1 min chart to look for a great entry point. 

Knowing to expect a pullback sometime after the open and most likely being around 1030 market time I would just watch and wait. I saw it making moves down and got my purchase order ready to go. 

At about 1039 EST I saw it had made a nice couple sideways candles off the 100ema and just waited for my signal that it was going to move higher. At about 1041 EST I pulled the trigger knowing that at 1042 the signal was about to be made seeing that the histogram was flat. Bought 20 call contracts 1 strike out of the money and just put in an immediate plus 50% sell order GTC. Then returned to the work at my job. 

Next thing I know the order was sold. I now just had to focus on work and thought about calling my wife and son after I was off work.

No position, but if you're holding a position in Valeant don't JUST sell because of the risk of default, especially if its caused by Centerbridge Partners. That being said theres a whole bunch of other reasons to sell.

The first thing you need to realize is that Centerbridge Partners is a distressed debt investor. This is what they do for a living. They buy bonds cheaper than the par value of 100 and try to get an instant return by forcing the company into bankruptcy. Bondholders are ahead of the line in bankruptcy court. If the company doesn't want to go into default then they have to buy Centerbridge Partner's bond at par.

They most likely bought the bonds in the 70s when everyone was panicking and they want to get paid off immediately at 100. That's a 42% return in a month. 

Having worked at a firm like Centerbridge, this is a strategy that is widely employed.

Why is this a bullish sign? It's because Centerbridge has done the valuation on the company and knows they can recover their bonds at 100.

Paul Singer employed this strategy to the Argentinian gov't

16-04-13,4emd70,"If you're going to YOLO, do it this way.","Then number one rule to winning at this is to have a plan. The number 2 is to get lucky. 

example 1: This apple chart was done a while ago, if you've seen or followed any of my posts. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/lHIrFoLO/

Criteria I use:

* 1) Pays dividend y/n?
* 2) Good brand recognition y/n?
* 3) It is a ""staple"" in the economy y/n?

Criteria you can use:

* 1) Does wsb think it will go up y/n?
* 2) Is it hot in the market y/n?
* 3) Can I afford to buy it with my tiny account y/n?

Regardless of which you use, there is a sound way to play YOLO's. What I've done here on this chart is not voodoo technical analysis. It is a visual representation of implied volatility (without math, although you can use the standard dev and get similar looking results). 

The assumptions that everyone has about the market:

* 1) The market will always go up in the end
* 2) At some point there will be a crash.

Really what this is saying is there's a 50/50 either way, with a skew towards the upside. The losses incurred are from opportunity cost and inflation if you just hold on until the end. 

Individual stocks are different. They will either go higher, do nothing, or bust. With the quality stocks there is less chance of it busting. These stocks are the ones that fit my selection criteria. You guys can use whatever the fuck you want. Whether it be a dart board, how much shit comes out of your ass, or a coin flip.

The way to do YOLO's is to mark out the possible rebound points either using the IV or do what I did on the chart.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/lHIrFoLO/

Each line represents a rebound point with a 50/50 chance of success. So, this provides you a trackplan for when you should put your money in and when you should exit. If you're a responsible better, you would have your max risk divided evenly over each of these lines which will give you a good average price and will eventually lead to profit -if assumption 1 is true (the market will always go up). 

A safety net for this is to only commit what youre willing to lose to this whole trackplan. This way if assumption 2 happens, a crash, and the stock goes bust, you only lost what you expected to lose.

Now, If you've picked ""quality"" stocks. The chances of you going bust is lessened due to the dividend, so your overall loss is redced from 100% loss to maybe 95% loss.

Now lets use the apple chart as an example. Let's say you were retarded and unlucky - you bought at the top $130. Following this track plan, you would have had two opportunities of profit - dividends. 

1) first rebound you would have likely had an average share price of 117-118 and an opportunity to sell around there + dividends.

2) rebound you would have had an average price of 110-111 and an opportunity to sell near there + dividends you've received.

Off each of these lines, in the event of a rebound, you can expect a jump of 5-10% to happen. SO when you trade options, you use this expected move in you calculations.

Good luck assholes!

The market will react on Monday to this PDUFA date news and the price will become erect, this will be the start of the run-up into 9/25/16 PDUFA date.

However, if I want my investments to be in stocks, what would be the advantage of having a Roth IRA v. just buying the stocks I want?

16-04-14,4epsig,How does my financial adviser make money from my taxable brokerage account?,"I've had a brokerage account (UBS) with an adviser for several years.  I was younger when I first got this account, but now that I'm a bit older, making a salary and just starting to manage my retirement accounts, I have wanted to take a more active roll with my taxable brokerage account.

I looked over my UBS statements and wasn't thrilled with my annual returns.  All of my money (~$20K) is invested in mutual funds - American Funds Income Fund of America CL A.  I called up my advisor and asked about it and he said last year was rough in terms of stocks (and the bonds I have are what saved me).  He said he's going to reinvest a 3rd of my money into a new 'section' of the mutual funds that is riskier, but potentially gives me more rewards (which is what I wanted).

I also asked my advisor how he makes money from my account.  He told me he actually doesn't right now, but just values the relationship (he also has accounts with some of my family members).  He also said, in the future, if I start giving him more money to invest, that's when he will start to make money off of me.  I just wanted to ask you guys if this sounds like something that's true?  My FA seems like a nice guy, but I wanted to get another opinion from you guys because you're non-biased....  It just seems kinda hard to believe.

**TLDR: My financial advisor claims he is not making money off my account at the moment at all, but will start to gain money potentially if I start to invest more money in the account.  Does this sounds true?  I like my FA - seems like a nice guy - but I find this hard to believe?**

16-04-14,4esh8n,ASHland long yolo via LEAPS - 100% profit potensh,"This is for my value-investing yoloers out there.

For any of you who matter, you already know Ashland is working on a tax free spin off of its profitable Valvoline business. For the rest of you fuck heads in here, which is about all of you, the reason behind this is because the value of valvoline is hidden due to being a cog in the inefficient machine of the overall business.  The spin off will unlock this hidden value.

As of writing this, ASH market cap is $7.11B. [Valvoline alone could be worth $7B.](http://www.wsj.com/articles/shareholder-urges-ashland-to-halt-valvoline-spinoff-1453258865) Obviously lots of value to unlock. 

This morning some more details have come out regarding Ashland's design of the spin off. I haven't worked my way through these revelations yet but it's obviously good shit considering investors' sentiment over the past week.

Regardless of how Ashland will distribute spin off profits to ASH shareholders (which *is* important, but lets move forward for now), [the true value of ASH is estimated to be $142 per share.](http://www.barrons.com/articles/valvoline-spinoff-a-45-gain-for-ashland-holders-1457759977) 

The spin off is supposed to be completed by the end of this year.

As we get closer to the spin off completion date, the market is going to start valuing ASH more fairly. Following the spin off is when the real value will be revealed, of course.

Let's assume the spin off will be completed by end of 2016. Let's also assume that, at the end of the day / regardless of how ASH investors are paid for Valvoline, their shares rise to a conservative $131 price.

As of checking this morning, I could buy a LEAP (a long term call option) on ASH with a strike price of $110 at about $10.50 an option. So you're in the money at $120.50 a share. The expiration date is Jan 2017.

So when that puppy goes to 131 a share, that'll give you a 100% profit on your ASH LEAP YOLO in 8 months. Yes that's longer than you dipshits like to hold onto anything, but that's a great investment.

I didn't buy the leaps because I want to read over the details of the spin off and see what opportunities are on the table, but if any of you posers have balls and don't give a shit about what else MIGHT be on the table, you can buy these LEAPS *TODAY*.

Who else has been following ASH since their spin off announcement? What do *you* see?

Edit: forgot to include LEAP expiration date.",2

If you have say $1000 that you absolutely don't need for anything until late summer, just buy that shit on a limit order and hold it out. It will go up to around $0.70 before dividend and then you also get the dividend of $0.20-.25 per share of course. 

Background
=
Why the fuck do they give out such a fat dividend when they are such trash, OP? [Royalties on drugs](http://enzon.com/docs/royalty) is my guess. Who cares. They give you money. Period. Evidence:

http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/enzn/dividend-history


This is for all of you who want a good piggybank that is not Wealthfront/Betterment faggotry or even worse: a savings account. Neither will make you 20-50% by summer so why not yolo this instead? If you think I'm full of it.

Why buy so early?
=
Cause OP did that one noob mistake back in December. Bought it the day before ex-div at almost $0.70. After the dividend was distributed, everyone sold pre-market, causing it to drop to $0.50 cancelling all my gains out (div $300, stock loss -$300, $1000 initial investment lol). Proof straight outta my tax return since you noobs never believe a fool these days.

My dividend:

My loss (left to right: date, # of shares, price I sold, date I bought, price I bought,  net-profit/loss):
http://i.imgur.com/AUKIQFQ.png

See if you buy early and way low, you can escape such a sell off unharmed and at least cash in the profit from the dividend. If you buy anywhere 1-2 weeks before, unlikely. I will bring this stock and its dividend back up when the time comes. Again, nothing for daytrading. This is for the piggybank, the stash of cash you just have sitting there. Make it work for you. I hope what I said makes sense.

16-04-15,4evs1i,Apr 14th 2016,"Today was a great day! For some reason I woke up early today around 630am, I think maybe because I left the screen of my laptop blasting my face on the highest brightness level all night. I decided just to get up and start the day. Brushing my teeth, slamming a protein shake and heading to breakfast. It was looking a lot nicer out today compared to the morning prior when it was raining nonstop. Walking in the rain is never fun, especially with a pair of New Balance Minimus shoes. There was a larger crowd entering before me; luckily they were new, and I just bypassed them to the grill guy cooking eggs. Nothing like a big plate of scrambled whites to start the day. I decided to add some fresh chopped tomatoes and onions on top. Totally worth it! After that, it was off to the gym. Wow, are my legs still sore. I managed to push through the back, leg and bi workout, but ouch! 

Leaving the gym and returning to my room, I saw that I needed to wash some laundry and put a load in the washer. After finishing up some homework, it was getting close to lunch. Wasn't a whole lot of healthy choices today but they did have some amazing baked sweet potatoes. They were huge, and I don't think they added any brown sugar to them. Doing laundry earlier, I noticed I was running low on detergent, so I walked to the store after lunch to pick some up. 

By the time I was done doing all my small tasks, I had given the charts a look. It was around 6 am EST, and I knew Pre-Market would be opening soon. Looking at the E-mini 21 min chart, it was looking pretty good. It made a nice pull back overnight to the daily center pivot point and ultimately bounced off of it.  Creating a buy signal and 512 am EST it was on the way to pushing back above the 55MA. I knew it I would be looking for an entry point to the upside after the market opened. 

Once I got to work the day was crazy, seemed like everything was going on. By the time everything calmed down, It was 12 pm EST. I pulled up the charts on $spy I had missed two great entry points at 1001am EST after bouncing off the 233MA and the center daily pivot point. What a great entry point after the open! The other was at 1051am EST, this time rejecting bouncing off the 233ma and rejecting its current position off the 55ma. 

Knowing I missed it for the day, I just decided just to watch and standby. Glad I did, shortly after it rejected the R1 pivot around 1 pm and created a sell signal at 142pm but not to go short. The rest of the day it just rode the topside of the Center Bollinger and upper and lower just squeezing together. 

The good trade was ""No bad trade"".

However, one question that I was hoping someone can answer: in economies like Sweden where GDP growth is back to pre-recession levels (4.5% YoY in Q4 2015, http://www.tradingeconomics.com/sweden/gdp-growth-annual) and inflation is below their target (core CPI: http://www.tradingeconomics.com/sweden/core-inflation-rate, headline CPI: http://www.tradingeconomics.com/sweden/inflation-cpi), why would the Riksbank use negative interest rate policy to keep their currency weak and stoke inflation? 

The economy is already growing strongly and negative interest rates only increase the risk of the economy overheating or distortions in various markets, like real estate for example. Why wouldn't Sweden employ the mid-2000s China playbook of building up substantial FX reserves to keep their currency weak, provide their central bank with greater monetary firepower backed by FX reserves, and also limit price distortions from negative interest rates?

Put simply, why is Sweden not ""printing"" it's way out of an overvalued currency and low inflation? Is it only because that would signal explicit currency intervention (and generate negative political goodwill) whereas the monetary policy route is more an implicit action?",1

My college's senior level investments class involves using the StockTrak portfolio simulator ,as I understand many universities do. Tomorrow at market close, the simulation will be coming to an end. The simulation began with $1,000,000 cash and each group has been required to employ the investment strategies discussed in class to compete against one another in regards to portfolio return. Given the market's unpredictable performance since January when the semester began, and the fact that day trading is not allowed by the professor, it has really come down to a game of luck rather than strategy for the novice investor. The only time that my group has seen any real movement in portfolio return was last week when we bet big (maximum investment of $250k) on Valeant in a desperate attempt to move from last place in the class before it was too late. By the next morning our portfolio was well in the lead and eventually settled down at 3rd when we sold the position and is now down to 5th. 

Now I'm asking for any suggestions on how to make that happen again. The way I see it, there is no reason not to make another big bet and see where it takes us. There isn't a large probability that we end up in last as the group currently there seems to have made every effort to secure that position. Every other group however, is close enough in returns that its anybody's game. The upside vastly outweighs the downside.

So do you guys/girls have any speculative ideas that you could throw  my way? Please help me spend my fake money.

I have started constructing an ETF portfolio through Robinhood that is relatively diversified and trying to focus on dividends, with a long term horizon. I'm 21 and basically starting this as a retirement account. 


So far, I think i have covered most of the basics for a diversified portfolio. Small, mid, large, and mega cap stocks, and short, intermediate, and long term bonds, both corporate and government. I have a few other miscellaneous investments like REITs.


For the breakdown of my portfolio, it's about 70% stock ETFs, 30% bond ETFs. The stocks are about 60% value and 40% growth/core, and spread relatively evenly regarding capitalization. For bonds, I have about 70% corporate and 30% government. Overall for bonds, it's around 60 percent long term, 20 percent short term, and 20 percent intermediate. 


Like I said, my strategy is a long term horizon looking for dividends/coupons which I am reinvesting. 


What are some good tips/pieces of advice for this strategy? I typically stick to vanguard for the low expenses and I just want to know if anything is drastically different between picking individual stocks versus ETFs for dividend investing.",30

My portfolio has gone up more than 10%, so technically I beat the market (for now), but looking at other stock performances over that same period of time, I could have made 42% had I allotted the same amount to different stocks.

When deciding which stock to buy, do investors compare projected performance with other stocks or just to the S&amp;P? Is there an online tool for this?

Edit: Sry for the confusion over ""best possible outcome""; I didn't mean for the market I meant for an individual investor. When I say I could have made 42%, that's based on the strategy I use, but I didn't evaluate every stock on the market, so I didn't *see* the stocks that I would have purchased based on my strategy (this isn't my day job).

This seems a bit hard to believe however I do like the idea of penny stock trading since my portfolio is relatively low and although I could lose ALOT, I could also make ALOT. What I've understood from this sub is penny stocks is something I shouldn't want to get into, but am unsure why.

Want I really want to know, is what some of you more experienced traders would recommend looking into if you were in my position as well as the programs needed as i'm uninterested in going through a broker. I am willing to devote time and am generally quite hardworking. Any input is appreciated. 

Many Thanks",2

From the economist:       

""Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton of the London Business School are the acknowledged experts on global investment returns, having compiled data covering 22 countries over more than a century. As of February 2013, the longest period of negative real returns from US equities was 16 years. But it was 19 years for global equities (and 37 for world ex-US), 22 for Britain, 51 for Japan, 55 for Germany and 66 for France. Such periods are much longer than most small investors would have the patience to wait.""            
  
It seems like there are significant periods of time which stocks may underperform historically which encompass a large amount of one's investment time horizon (say 40-60 years, start investing early 20s, retire by 70s).",46

I figured her track record at Toms would help them as well as finally expanding in Asia. I averaged down the whole way and now I am sitting on about 30% return. Some analysts are saying it could go all the way to $100 a share, others have it pegged at $30. I've never seen so much conflicting information on a stock. Should I take the money and run? It has an 8 B market cap. I think based on the premiere brand appeal and the expansion in Asia, it could eventually be a 10-13 Billion dollar company (or be bought out)

I'm interested in shorting the market. I've read online and on reddit about what shorting is, but all of the examples keep using non-stock examples like comparing a stock to a book that was lent to you for $5, which you sell for market value of $50, then buy back at the price of, say, $25 dollars when it goes down in value and return it to the original owner for a total profit of $20.

However, I'd like to learn how to do this IRL with my stock. How can I short the market on schwab.com, and is there any way I can use the stocks I already own instead of being lent stocks by my broker?

Even if not, if I put in a short order for, say, 10 shares of SCHB costing about $500, do I actually have to physically sell them immediately to get the market price, then buy them back later when those shares are worth only $400?

Thanks, so I think I understand the concept but not how to actually do it.

It's got an interesting story behind it. To keep it brief, a former employee who was an internal auditor filed a lawsuit against the company last October, leading to shares dropping some ~30%. 

Yesterday morning, on April 14th, [this](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3965195-walls-closing-branchless-bank) article was posted to Seeking Alpha describing an update to the lawsuit released April 11th, it's main claim being that there is apparently more employees than just that one auditor coming forward.

The bulls argue that the writer of the article (appropriately named ""The Friendly Bear"") has skin in the short game, and was trying to reverse what quite possibly is beginning to look like a short squeeze. That or to cover some April 15th puts as one bull proposed. In the comment section of that SA article, there are many bulls who argue that:
1. The lawsuit is bogus and the stock will be back on track headed to the moon in no time
or
2. Worst case scenario, BOFI pays a few fines and continues on making money, however legal/illegal it is.

The bears argue that shares began to drop before the article was released, which I'm skeptical about because shares closed up ~5% on April 13th - 2 days after the April 11th lawsuit was released, but the day before the SA article was posted on the 14th. Something doesn't add up. How would the top dogs not know the repercussions of that lawsuit update immediately after it was released? I think the bears(/shorts) are dragging this thing down to cover their butts.

Shares somewhat tanked again yesterday down just over 16%. I picked some shares up, but obviously it's an extremely risky bet. I think it's really a compelling story and would love to hear opinions if anyone is familiar or wants to do a little digging along with me.",31

16-04-14,4etnlo,Grocery Stores Metrics,"Same Store Sales: You want to see improving sales/sq foot growth and decreasing OPEX per sq foot in an ideal environment.

Employment Tracker: This is an important metric to track and is arguably more important for higher end grocers as consumers will purchase less if unemployed. Generally speaking when there are job losses (08 recession) then grocery sales decline materially as well. This is a bit more specific to a company such as whole foods as lower end cheaper goods would not be hit as hard during a recession (pasta/grains/bread as a simple example of a food that would be hit less in a recession).

Revenue Mix: All revenue is not created equal and you can see the expansion of four different streams within a grocery store. Bakery, branded, Hot/prepared food, and regular produce. Generally speaking we would want to see all of these lines growing, however an emphasis will be placed on branded items (think of grocery specific brand of produce, you see this at most major grocery chains) as they would command higher margins. Simplistically, if you own the entire process/chain you can usually generate higher margins over the long-term. Finally, prepared foods generally command higher margins as well (so focus in on prepared and branded/private label!)

Branding and Positioning: Most younger readers will skip this piece since it is unrelated to financials but it is hands down the most important part of evaluating the future. The ability to charge a premium price and command higher margins will be tied to the business perception of Whole Foods. You want to track (surveys can be a good measure) how the brand's perception is holding up. If people begin to believe the products sold at whole foods are no longer healthy or no longer ""high end"" the business model can suffer tremendously. Sales decline, pricing comes under pressure as people are unwilling to pay a premium causing margin pressure as well.

Valuation: From a valuation range grocery stores are about 1 turn higher on a EV/EBITDA basis versus apparels and a few turns higher on P/E metrics as well. You're looking at roughly 7-16x EV/EBITDA, 15-30x P/E and PEG's of 1.5-3.5.

Summary: A lot of the metrics are similar, however for grocers you can zero in on some other key metrics. We chose Whole Foods in particular as it is a bit more interesting due to the growth of ""specialty"" grocery stores versus simple blanket super markets. Looking for 1) same store sales growth as always 2) Branding/positioning to protect margins, 3) ideally expansion of branded product sales, 4) opex reductions per square foot and 5) private label/prepared food growth.",0

16-04-14,4etol5,A short explanation of unconditional versus conditional expectations (aka educating /u/Vagina_Fang),"This post is one last attempt to get through to /u/vagina_fang who was quite insistent in the following (now locked) thread that using the historical average of past returns was the only correct way of coming up with expected returns for the market.

https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/4duabs/mark_cuban_claims_that_cash_is_king_and/

You want to take the unconditional average of the historical returns. That’s perfectly fine. What the various people you were arguing with were saying is that you might also want to consider what’s going on more broadly. In other words, using historical realized returns as a proxy for expected returns is not the only way to make a forecast.

You may already know all this, but it may be useful to review what a conditional versus unconditional expectation is. Suppose you are interested in forecasting the temperature in Los Angeles. You look at the data for last 100 years and take the average. That’s the unconditional expectation. Is that the best you can do when making a forecast? Yes, if that’s all the information you have. But suppose you also know that it’s summer time. Obviously your forecast of the temperature, conditional on it being summer, is going to be higher.  Again you use the historical data, but now instead of using all the data points, you use the ones for summer. Suppose you further know that the forecast period is night time. Again, you’d incorporate this other piece of information to get the conditional temperature forecast for a summer evening in LA.

So when you are shouting 9% as the expectation for stock returns on the basis that it's the long-run historical average (calculated correctly with the right data, hopefully), you are like the person who always forecasts 15 degrees Celsius for the temperature in LA. If the forecast period is night time in the summer, you can do better by using this information. Similarly you can form better expectations of stock returns if you account, for example, for the very low level of interest rates.

Here you might object that using information about interest rates is based on opinions and views. Of course you are right since the term structure is based on how market participants are pricing bonds.  But it’s a very mild and reasonable use of conditioning information. Again, if we go back to the weather forecasting analogy, we are using something like day versus night or the season of year. It’s using some conditioning information, but nothing like the mountains of atmospheric data that actual weather forecasters crunch with their supercomputers.

Similarly in markets, you’ve got hedge funds and other institutional investors crunching huge amounts of information using very sophisticated computer programs. You don’t understand or trust this sort of approach. Fine. But that doesn’t mean you should completely ignore ALL information about the current economic environment. Finally, if you think information surprises don't matter since they ""just average out"" over the long run, take a look at Elton's 1999 paper.

I am an ex-professional; Series 7 ex-licensee among other designations. I'm out of the industry entirely now and enjoying working at a low stress job that has nothing to do with investing. However, I still enjoy investing, and I still enjoy watching people make money.

I've done quite a bit of DD on Valeant ($VRX) before I invested, myself. I was wondering if there is any interest in reading what I've done.

If there's interest, I will go deeper and DD the shit out of this stock all weekend, as much as I can compile within the limited timeframe. I will post for you a two part due diligence, starting on Monday. All the big questions -- what the company does, what happened, who's involved (then and now), what we don't know, and some of the more common objections that I had before investing in Valeant and the results of investigating into those objections.

This DD will be in time for the upcoming Valeant catalysts that will be happening this month; you can use this knowledge to figure out if you want to be in before, after, or not at all. 

We're already starting to hear bits and pieces of what's going on underneath the surface, and it's looking good so far.

If you have any specific questions that you'd like to see, please add them below. I will research as many as I can within the limited timeframe.",81

With global energy demand on the rise, along with demand for renewables, I feel the company is poised for a bright future.

**[tl;dr me and a french pharma company are dropping 310 million and one thousand dollars on kidney cancer drug with a priority pdufa coming out in 10 weeks. there is long term potential for this exelxis in their pipeline but my target sale is less than 10 weeks. Exelexis has debt and non-existent cash flow and is already second to the market. Still Exelexis, a french pharma company, and myself are yoloing on good pdufa news. Let the hype train squeeze out the shorts and maybe even hold through the binary news](http://imgur.com/Z1QtIjn)**  
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
**stock info and upcoming catalyst**  
Exelixis (exel) is in the cancer game. They filed for a june 22 priority PDUFA for a kidney cancer drug this year. there are already 20 RCC drugs on the market fighting over 60,000 new kidney cancer patients per year. They have a US drug distributor and made a deal with a european one.   
  
They are trading in the middle of their 52-week range at $4.xx with an average volume of 4.5 million averaged monthly and 3.8 million averaged recently. friday was below volume. you technical guys say that could be a local bottom. or top. Theres almost a 8-12 day short ratio on the stock. depending on if you ask yahoo or wsj. good news could get better with the potential for a short squeeze. 
  
Share price hasn't changed much over the past three months. And is down about 50% from 6th month highs. [those highs last year came as a result of their METEOR Kidney cancer trial results and drug marketing deals with other companies.](http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/01/06/exelixis-inc-nearly-quadrupled-in-2015-heres-why.aspx)  
  
Fuck the moon, I'm going to a METEOR and riding a priority PDUFA coming out at the end of June. Stock price has shown to jump up around 20% on positive phase three results for the meteor trial. Shorts exiting on the potential for good news + results 20% jump = big upside.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
**big money support**    

Early this year, Exelixis traded future european retail profits for 200 million up front in cash and 110 more in milestone bonuses with a french pharma company called ipsen. [source](http://www.xconomy.com/san-francisco/2016/02/29/on-comeback-trail-exelixis-reels-in-200m-deal-for-cancer-drug/) [source](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160229006848/en/Exelixis-Ipsen-Enter-Exclusive-Licensing-Agreement-Commercialize) This is a slightly more retail than gamble than the convertible shares for 5.31 a share of 4.25% they offered back in 2012. [source](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120809005727/en/Exelixis-Announces-Pricing-Concurrent-Offerings-30-Million) [source](http://www.thestreet.com/story/11722003/1/exelixis-big-money-raise-leaves-stock-in-rut.html) Exelixis is giving up some retail share for some operating cash. Genentech, MNKD's friend Sanofil both have partnerships with Exelixis as well.  
    
&amp;nbsp;  
    
**time frame rationale**  

Exelixis has enough operating cash for another business year, but after that, if this cancer shit doesn't work, they'd have to go back to the well. That wouldnt be good. Last [setback caused them to fire 70% of their workforce](http://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/exelixis-axes-70-of-workforce-after-failed-foray-into-prostate-cancer). It's a company full of management willing to yolo their workforce on their drugs. if they gamble and are willing to start over, I'll ride with them 
  
I'm only looking at these guys for a 3 month, PDUFA target. I feel like Ipsen is doing the same thing. And if someone is willing to bet 310 million on the chance to have access to retail rights for the drug, so am I. I'm hoping the shorts get scared and the hype builds up in May. I'll build my load in the coming 6 weeks. 
    
&amp;nbsp;
  
**other info**  

negatives: what's this europe deal? well bristol meyers squibb already has what exel calls ""a very similar"" product that does what exelexis does. they made 942 million in sales off it, maybe 800 in the us.

So while oil is in its crazy Doha weekend, coincidently gold is in the same make or break position right now.

... Weird.

Ok, so it turns out the London gold fix has been suppressing the price of precious metals to boost their western fiat currencies, USD included.

[This week they were finally exposed when Deutsche Bank agree to settle and name the other banks involved.](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-13/deutsche-bank-settles-silver-price-fixing-claims-lawyers-say)

Well I'm guessing China knew that gold has been undervalued because they (and Russia) decided to start grabbing as much as they could over the last many years. They even brought their gold stores in London back to China.

The interesting thing here is that the London gold fix got busted just one week before Shanghai (the world's largest gold market) begins [their own gold price fix.](http://goldstockbull.com/articles/gold-price-discovery-moving-to-china-in-april/)

Ok, so London has been keeping gold's value lower than it should be and China is going to start setting the price themselves... 

Idk about you guys but if I had the most gold in the world and I got to set it's price after the previous asshole got caught suppressing the value, I'd probably increase it... A lot... but at a steady pace of course.

[Last Sunday there was a HUGE rally in gold when Chinese companies started grabbing gold mining companies up at the opening of the market.](http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-goes-prospecting-for-worlds-gold-mines-1460266225)

... Weird.

Jsyk I am currently holding $NUGT and $DWTI. #YOLO

If you own $DUST or $UWTI I hope you lose everything you've got, sorry.

If anyone has anything to say about this please say it because I don't want to be wrong.

[Here's a forbes article just in case you want other info.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kitconews/2016/04/13/chinas-yuan-based-gold-fix-to-include-two-international-banks/#6becdb4c73b7)

Oh, and put your tin foil hat on for this one. 
With gold and oil teetering on a balance beam this week, is it possible that there is an international plot to destroy the USD?

Of course this wouldnt be much of a problem as long as Fort Knox still had all the gold from before the USD left the gold standard... but what if that's why Janet Yellen had an emergency meeting with both the president and vice president?

Its been speculated that the gold was sold decades ago.

I purchase new shares each month. Turning off DRIP would not increase my transaction fees for buying stocks, but it might result in up to a one month delay before my next round of investments. Historically, I have kept DRIP turned on in my non-retirement accounts. More recently, however, I have read that it can cause a tax cost basis headache down the line. I am not an active trader, and I generally buy and hold with annual readjustments. 

Should I turn off automatic reinvestment of dividends in my non-retirement investing accounts? 

Thanks. ",4

I think it's without question that esports are on a great trajectory, and I can certainly see this develop into a top-4 (or even higher) popular sport world wide in the next ~10-20 years.

What public companies do you believe are best poised to profit off of this growing industry?

I bought some Activision this week, and was fortunate enough to realize the positive spike, but am long on the company due to its great track record of games, but also because it's invested in this sector and appears adamant on riding the wave.

Are there any other angles that people see? I considered Nvidia, but am in general concerned about the lack of the company's involvement in the mobile PC sector (and while drone racing could also become popular, I'm not sure how big that market can become).",34

16-04-16,4f3k9o,The truth about Wall Street Bets.,"Can someone please translate whatever message Wall Street Bets is trying to convey into something that I might better be able to understand, like Yiddish or that Bushman clicking language? As it stands, I have no idea whether Wall Street Bets is seriously claiming that the more paperasserie and bureaucracy we have to endure, the better, or if it's simply the case that he brandishes the word “thymolsulphonephthalein” as a kind of up-to-date jack-o'-lantern to scare children. Unlike his discourteous hatchet jobs, what I'm about to write is supported in scientific scholarship by overwhelming evidence. For instance, he who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. Of course, people like Wall Street Bets who do in fact perpetrate evil threaten the common good. The key point here is that he is like a magician who produces a dove in one hand while the other hand is vilifying our history, character, values, and traditions. Wall Street Bets's moral immaturity is a perilous failing and an insult to the celebrated virtues of our ancestors. He will almost certainly tiptoe around that glaringly evident fact because if he didn't, you might come to realize that while he and other psychotic jobbernowls sometimes differ on the details and scale of their upcoming campaigns of terror they never fail to agree on the basic principle and substance. Hence, it is imperative that you understand that if Wall Street Bets is victorious in his quest to place deluded thought police at the top of the social hierarchy, then his crown will be the funeral wreath of humanity.

Some people I know say that Wall Street Bets is the hidden hand behind all modern cataclysms. Others argue that he recognizes the worst types of insecure duffers there are as fellow peers, as cousins-german, and as brothers. At this point the distinction is largely academic given that Wall Street Bets doesn't use words for communication or for exchanging information. He uses them to disarm, to hypnotize, to mislead, and to deceive. If he manages to foster and intensify his drug-drenched drama of immorality, our nation will not endure as a civilization, as a geopolitical entity, or even as a society. Rather, it will exist only as a prison, a prison in which conceited clodpates engage in or goad others into engaging in illegal acts.

Wall Street Bets parrots whatever ideas are fashionable at the moment. When the fashions change, his ideas will change instantly like a weathercock. Have you ever sat and listened to him talk about how the cure for evil is more evil? If so, you should be congratulated for successfully enduring the huffy nonsense dribbling from his mouth. I would much rather hear someone talk about how Wall Street Bets says he's going to abet a resurgence of stroppy, shrewish diabolism in the near future. Is he out of his mind? The answer is fairly obvious when you consider that he wants to keep us helpless and afraid. While none of us need to be so fearful, we are. These fears make it difficult for us to dispense justice. This is why is critical that we talk about how if he is going to talk about higher standards then he needs to live by those higher standards.

Wall Street Bets has for a long time been arguing that he's a living bodhisattva of peace and nonviolence. Had he instead been arguing that the culture of arrogance that permeates his coalition leads many members to break our country's national and patriotic backbone and make it ripe for the slave's yoke of international boosterism, I might cede him his point. As it stands, the leap of faith required to bridge the logical gap in Wall Street Bets's arguments is simply too terrifying for me to contemplate. What I do often contemplate, however, is how he once said that unfounded attacks on character, loads of hyperbole, and fallacious information are the best way to make a point. Oh, please. I'm just glad I hadn't eaten dinner right before I heard him say that. Otherwise, I'd probably still be vomiting too hard to tell you that Wall Street Bets has not increased our safety, security, or happiness by focusing too much on one side of the equation and not enough on the broader perspective of things. All he's increased by doing that is the girth of his bloated ego.

Wall Street Bets insists that sin is good for the soul. I proclaim that this allegation does not withstand scrutiny, in part because Wall Street Bets wants to twist my words six ways for Sunday. Who does he think he is? I mean, the space remaining in this letter will not suffice even to enumerate the ways in which he has tried to turn the social order upside-down so that the dregs on the bottom become the scum on the top. Now for some parting advice: Look at the facts. Analyze the arguments. Think about the motives of the people who are telling you that people don't mind having their communities turned into war zones. And have confidence in yourself. Remember, Wall Street Bets expresses a vainglorious nostalgia for a uniform, unchallenging, homogeneous society that never really existed.",21

I posit that they are about to have a large increase in share price. 

Currently at ~0.15 per share, they have only begun to sell product and started earning revenues in 2015Q3.

Revenues:

FY-2015 - $31291

4Q-2015 - $23902

3Q-2105 - $7389.

That's a total quarter over quarter increase of 223%.


Now there are 2 types of licensure under Canadian legislation [MMRP](http://www.leafscience.com/2014/04/01/canada-medical-marijuana-mmpr-guide-25-questions-answers/):

 
A license for dried cannabis (CULTIVATE and/or SELL); and

A license for fresh marijuana and oil (PRODUCE and/or SELL).


[There are only 8 companies listed that have their license to sell cannabis oil](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/marihuana/info/list-eng.php). Of those 8, only 2 are currently publicly traded. Those 2 are:

Mettrum Health Corp:MT - market cap $57 M, shares out 33 M; and 

Canopy Growth Corp:CGC - market cap $250 M, shares out 101 M.
 

Of course, a 3rd that is listed is Emerald Health Therapeutics.

Their market cap is $7.6 M with 46 M shares out.


The company stated in their Sept/30/2015 update ""Management's Discussion and Analysis"" that they anticipate having a fresh marijuana and oil sales license for early 2016, [as described on page 4](http://www.emerald.care/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/EHT-Q3-2015-MDA-FINAL.pdf)






A friend of mine told me one of his pals who works for RBC got wind of a re-evaluation coming up for this company. They said they just attained their license to sell Cannabis Oil, which previously was not a sure thing. The rumour was, now that they have the license, RBC is expecting the pps to be ~$22.

First here's some info about my current situation. I just got back from a trip to Japan with my Fiancé, and I told myself that whatever money I had left unspent from the trip I would invest as aggressively as possible just to try to get some extra cash for a down payment on a house (that number ended up being just over 2,000 dollars). We already have about 73-74k saved up for a down payment, and she just got a raise that should help out in that department as well. 

We get married in October of 2017 and plan to buy a house shortly after that. We should have all the money we need for a down payment either way, but I want this invested money to just give us that extra little ""umph"" when it comes to submitting a strong offer. So here I am with two grand and enough of a cushion to play fast and loose with it over the next two years.

**How old are you?** - About to turn 25

**Are you employed/making income? How much?** Yes, about 32-35k a year as a freelance production assistant. My fiancé makes about 50k a year.

**What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)** Make as much money as humanly possible in two years.

**What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)** - I really won't care if this money disappears. It won't destroy me. I'm basically gambling at this point.

**What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)** - I've got some other investments that I've had for a while, including about 35k in a ROTH IRA.

**Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)** - Not really

**What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?** - About two years, but definitely no earlier than October 2017.

**Any big debts?** - No debt whatsoever.

**Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.** - I think that about covers it. I'm really just looking for some advice on what stocks people like as a potentially extremely high return in the near-ish future regardless of risk. Whether it capitalizes on all the Saudi asset sell off shit or maybe some other sector that has the potential to explode for some reason or another. I'm a blank slate at this point, so literally any advice is welcome.

And also this would be in small font if I knew how to in alien blue)

I'm a little drunk right now, so I'm copypastaing what I responded below to someone, cause it's the most detailed thing I've typed out do far as a result of being lazy:

Oil dependance reduction is the obvious a answer, but I'm trying to look a little bit deeper in to this. I.e. Who make carbon testing equipment, who makes things that could become adopted as the industry standard specifications for testing, reduction equipment, etc., short sulfur ccompanies because of possible sulfur reduction regulations in fuel, buy nat gas, short cattle producers, who makes methane reduction equipment, who would be a main consultant to the EPA, anything Monsanto related? I don't know the abswers, but these are the questions that first come to mind. ",12

I tried googling the company, and there isn't much information about them. Tried to see if they were bought out or went out of business and still didn't find anything. Does anyone know if these stocks have any value to them? It's a total of 1000 shares for $1 per share. 

what would be a good first step to figure out there worth? assuming they have value.

EDIT01:
thanks for the information everyone! i have contacted a broker, and sent him some photos of the stocks, he is going to do some digging for me. I also found 2 more stocks, a total of 1500 shares of The Big Four Mining &amp; Smelting Co. and 12 shares of National Time Savings Bank. I do not think the bank is still around due to the stock is older then the great depression, but i'm hoping that a big bank owns them now!! I will keep you all posted.

UPDATE:
contacted broker, he said all the stocks were worthless. expect for the fact that they are old and might be worth something to a collector. Thank you everyone for your help!",21

How is it possible that these get exchanged at premium? My ideas were:

* Caused by the negative interest rate (but why exactly would someone still buy them)?
* Investors use them as a way to invest in the Euro currency.
* Investors are betting on a Italy rating upgrade.
* A general bad view of the markets makes investors prefer a certain small loss than to take a bigger risk (then why don't hold cash)?
* Partial answers on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Why-would-you-ever-buy-a-zero-coupon-bond-above-par), but I am not totally satisfied with those.

16-04-17,4f97as,How I Traded The Big Breakout In 3D Printing Stocks DDD and SSYS,"On March 27 I alerted a trading idea I had about the 3D printing industry and how I thought several stocks were setting up for a nice big bottom reversal breakout, one of my bread and butter setups I go over in great detail here. Well last Thursday we got that big breakout day and I banked big time in DDD. Anyone that had this on their watchlist should have profited along side me. If you weren't watching it consider this a lesson because this really is an easy money setup and money in the market doesn't always come this easy, so you have to take as much as you can when these awesome opportunities are presented to you..

The big catalyst on Thursday was the fact that an analyst at Bank of America finally upgraded the stock. Most analyst have been bearish on these stocks for a couple years and they are usually late to the party with regards to flipping sides. DDD was up 10.12% on Thursday to close at $18.28 and SSYS (which I did not trade) was up 5.92% to finish at $$29.35. While I strongly feel analyst upgrades are not to be trusted long term the fact is idiots, suckers and fools that can't think for themselves listen to analyst opinions and therefore in the short term there can sometimes be huge opportunities to take advantage of the volume that these lemmings create.

Remember the market isn't black and white and as you can see from the huge shooting star candle which is also covered here, you have to take the profits quickly and not get greedy because upgrades are typically a way for large players to exit their trades at the expense of the uninformed general public. If somebody is upgrading the stock there is a good chance it is because they want to create some buying pressure which they can then use to sell positions with a nice profit.

When you start to think like a contrarian trader it becomes a lot more clear how money is made from the market.The fact is the chart doesn't lie. When the patterns are there and the probability is stacked in your favor you have to be ready to take on more risk. While it may be hard in the beginning to have faith in a system, the reality is as you get more notches under your belt, and your confidence in the methodology you are using increases, your success will greatly start to increase. That is truly what profitable trading is all about. It is about having this understanding of what should happen in the short term, and how you strategically position yourself to benefit off of this small built in advantage. Sometimes your gains will be small and other times they will be huge! You never know what the outcome of a situation will be, but I can assure you that over time you will make a significant amount of money if you repeat the same process over and over again.

Now truth be told, DDD is not a true penny stock, but there are two reasons I am covering it. First of all, it is a volatile stock and moves a lot like a penny stock. I like volatility because it allows me to enter a stock and have the trade pan out quickly. When you enter and a stock does not go anywhere it really starts to seem like you ware watching paint dry and this is bad because it results in new traders typically making poor decisions.

I bought the stock starting on March 29 at $15.31. This was a swing trade for me and I took a 1000 share position which is very small, which left me a lot of room to add as needed. As of April 13 I was up $1,920 on the stock and I hadn't added any shares. This past Thursday I bought an addition 5000 shares of DDD at 9:27 AM EST at $18.32 just before the market was opening. The reason was quite simple. I had been swinging the stock for 12 days (which is a bit long for me) and there was a catalyst in the stock that I had been waiting for for a few weeks. That morning the stock had gapped up 7.2% and although I normally would take the stock off immediately for a profit, from prior experience and from looking at my system, I knew DDD could move a bit more. Of course I didn't know the stock was going to move exactly 10% but my system showed me what the potential was, and from there I merely just followed my trading plan. The stock quickly took off and by 10 AM I was already up quite nicely. I scaled out in 1/4's with my final sale coming in at $19.58 not to far from the top.

Now if I was a position trader perhaps I would have had a bit more of a long term view on the stock but the fact is when you have thousands of dollars in profits dangling in front of you you are a fool if you don't snap it. Greed will destroy you as a trader. I can guarantee that... Maybe the stock goes higher as it recovers over the next few months but I am not an investor. I am a trader and I would much rather extract consistent profits in the shorter term rather than waiting months or years.

### Introduction

This is a primer about Valeant ($VRX). It will expire and become obsolete upon the release of updated Valeant financial statements, which could happen any day, though is supposed to happen before the 29th of April. *Right now, this is a guide into possibly taking advantage of the uncertainty around Valeant, which has depressed the stock.*

Valeant ($VRX) is probably the only time that I have seen [/r/investing](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing), [/r/wallstreetbets](http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets), and buy side research like [Morningstar](http://www.morningstar.com/) actually agree with one another. Morningstar [rates it as 5 stars](http://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/vrx/quote.html) as of this release date (April 18, 2016). This is so infrequent that it is like having an alignment of the planets.

When I see overlapping worlds get excited, I immediately want to know the story. Over a weekend, I began pulling together all of the different sources and piecing together as much as I could in a limited amount of time.

It is not intended as a replacement for commentary by a CFA (which can be found [here](http://analysisreport.morningstar.com/stock/research?t=VRX&amp;region=usa&amp;culture=en-US&amp;HID=QUO_STK118), (subscription required)), rather, it is a quick and dirty attempt to explain, in ordinary language, what the company does, how it makes money, who are the players involved, and what are some catalysts for its past fall and its future rise.

We are *all* trying to figure this one out before things are released, and where there's uncertainty, there's always opportunity. If you want to dig deeper and do more homework, this will kick it off. Use my work in addition to your own work or methods. 

###Valeant Pharmaceuticals International - The Basics

####What Does It Do?

Valeant is a large cap pharmaceutical company. The company's business model involves purchasing other mature companies that have had a successful track record for its portfolio, and then distributing that company's products. It has been [described as the Berkshire Hathaway](http://fortune.com/2015/05/04/bill-ackman-valeant-could-be-next-berkshire-hathaway/) of pharma. Others have compared it to [""Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball), a book that discusses how baseball teams can gain a significant competitive edge by hand-picking players from a pool of candidates who only have the [winning qualities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabermetrics) which make them, statistically, most likely to succeed.

Valeant differs from other large cap pharma companies in terms of how research and development for new products is done. A typical pharma company does its own research and development in-house. Upon approval to sell the drug, the company shifts the drug over to the manufacturing/sales/marketing side of its business. In contrast, at Valeant, when the company is acquired, the less cost-effective, expensive features (e.g., research and development) are removed, leaving only the revenue generating features. Valeant doesn't do its own R&amp;D -- it has others do it for them.

The reason this business model has been successful is because it allows focus and specialization. The founders of small R&amp;D pharma research companies are generally not interested in building an empire around their inventions. They want to stick to their research roots, what they enjoy, and be acquired by a larger company with deep pockets. They are researchers, not marketers or salespeople -- and they don't want to be. They want to cash out and move onto the next exciting thing. 

In contrast, Valeant, by having an extensive portfolio, is designed to be able to specialize in handling what happens after the R&amp;D is finished. By handling the actual manufacturing, marketing, selling, and support of the product that was developed, they can build the necessary infrastructure around the product to make it a success.

This business model worked so well that Valeant shares had [returned in excess of 2,300%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Michael_Pearson#Career) since 2008 until 2015, making Valeant the ""most valuable"" and the best performer on the Toronto Stock Exchange. In fact, Valeant was the [largest Canadian company](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/10/21/valeant-shares-halted-citron-enron_n_8347766.html) as of early to mid-2015.

####Why is its Portfolio Special?

As a global company, the brands and products in Valeant's portfolio are distributed worldwide. The company is big enough that it would be a part of the S&amp;P 500 if Valeant were American (Valeant is a Canadian company). The point being, it's a big company with a big portfolio.

Like Berkshire Hathaway, there is defensiveness in maintaining a diverse portfolio. The company is less reliant on a single product or service becoming a success or failing. There is room for products to become unprofitable and age out. This is a large plus for a potential Valeant investor.

The portfolio of Valeant's brands is quite wide. Depending on where one lives in the world, the brands can be seen in television advertisements or in the grocery store: Bausch &amp; Lomb, Boston, CeraVe, and Cortaid, to name a few.

Aside from consumer brands, [here is a list of actual pharma drugs](http://www.drugs.com/manufacturer/valeant-pharmaceuticals-international-147.html) that Valeant is behind. There are also a lot of easily recognized names in here: Wellbutrin, Retin-A (acne medication), Jublia, and Ativan, for example.

Most experts would agree that Valeant's portfolio is its most valuable asset. The commentary about Valeant's strength that I have read often mentions its severely undervalued, carefully cultivated portfolio. The investment thesis is this: if this portfolio makes Valeant money with bad management, imagine what it could do with great management.

####How Does It Make Money?

As mentioned, Valeant sells the products of its acquired former companies. This is not entirely exciting nor controversial. It's combining and sharing resources to cut costs in the manufacturing. It's figuring out marketing and training a salesforce. It's the re-use of equipment, real estate, and facilities that are very capex and/or labor intensive. It makes a lot of sense.

Aside from cutting costs, money is also made by raising prices after acquisition. This practice is normal, regardless of industry, as it is natural for nervous companies to want to recoup their costs as quickly as possible. For example, when Disney acquired Star Wars, it immediately switched into high gear with marketing and licensing while filling its pipeline with blockbuster movies, in fact, [one per year until 2019](http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/star-wars/241723/full-star-wars-movie-release-calendar) from the Star Wars universe.

However, the practice became controversial after Turing CEO [Martin Shkreli went viral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Shkreli#Price_hike_controversy) for acquiring the drug Daraprim and turning it from a $13.50 pill to a $750 pill, an eye-watering 5,556% increase that produced instant outrage. 

Valeant CEO J. Michael Pearson later commented on the controversy by saying that he only expected prices to go up [modestly, in the single digits](http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/valeant-earnings-drug-prices-1.3278124) in 2016.

It is worth noting that, for most people, insurance can often pay the difference in a price hike. In reading comments people have written about Valeant ""price hikes"", it is clear that most people do not actually understand what they are paying or not paying, but they are upset about the concept. People with insurance have copays, so they often do not notice price hikes. For everyone else, there's the American Healthcare Proxy Fight. More on that in a bit.

In the case of consumer products sold in the grocery store where people do pay cash, they can be marketed as premium consumer products to capture higher margins.

####What are Some Possible Catalysts Happening This Month?

In the next two installments, which I will post over the next two days, we will discuss the past and the future of Valeant by focusing on its management. However, to end this installment, here are some catalysts investors are watching for *this month*:

1. A possible new CEO announcement
2. CEO Pearson leaving, formally
3. The accounting for last year, being submitted and audited
4. Analysts reviewing the submitted data in detail and updating their outlooks
5. Pearson is called before Congress (this will generate some negative publicity for Valeant). More about this tomorrow.
6. A possible announcement of a strategic asset sale to liquidate debt and/or a strategy around paying down and restructuring debt

All of these, to some degree, eliminate uncertainty. Uncertainty in the near-term creates volatility. Many new investors to Valeant are anticipating that the elimination of that uncertainty, if one or more of these catalysts is executed successfully, will generate a large jump in the stock.

####Tomorrow

In our next installment, we will cover, in detail, catalysts for why Valeant's stock was depressed so much during 2015-2016. We will review how CEO J. Michael Pearson, once a superstar, became sloppy and was fired.

And, in Wednesday's installment, we will focus on the future -- new management, new ideas, and fresh thinking. We'll become familiar with the legendary hedge fund manager who bet $1B on Valeant and took the seat of the fired CFO on the Board of Directors, determined to make Valeant a success because his reputation now depends on it.",98

16-04-18,4fed86,$RPRX analysis,"**Company Summary:** [Repros Therapeutics Inc.](http://www.reprosrx.com/), a biopharmaceutical company, focuses on the development of new drugs to treat hormonal and reproductive system disorders for male and female in the United States. Its product portfolio includes enclomiphene, an oral therapy, which is in Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of low testosterone levels due to secondary hypogonadism; and Proellex that is in Phase IIB clinical trials for the treatment of symptoms associated with uterine fibroids, as well as in Phase II clinical trial for the treatment of endometriosis. The company has a license agreement with the National Institutes of Health to develop and commercialize Proellex.

&amp;nbsp;

 **Analysis:**
Stock price soared for this company last week after they released favorable findings for Proellex. Their testosterone drug, Androxal, is basically another “me too” drug and I’m doubtful it will get approved in the U.S. – actually I’m hoping it doesn’t so the price will drop and I can scoop up more shares at an even cheaper price (although it is predicted to do OKAY in Europe). The important drug in their pipeline is Proellex. There are limited treatments for endometriosis and this drug could be a blockbuster for that disease  if approved. They are researching both a vaginal and oral form of this product. I feel pretty confident the vaginal form will get approved (little systemic absorption and targeted delivery bode well for both safety and efficacy of the drug). The oral form (in my opinion) has the potential to have some nasty side effects, and I’m a bit more pessimistic on its ability to get FDA-approval. That being said, vaginal delivery is really not much of a hindrance for women (insert joke here) –for example, women use tampons on a regular basis.


&amp;nbsp;

 The company realizes the potential of Proellex and recently stated they will stop performing studies for their testosterone drug and focus their efforts on Proellex if recent studies for the testosterone product do not show the results that the FDA is looking for ([link](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-repros-study-idUSKCN0XB2IK)). The company states these results will be available before June.
With 2 forms of Proellex in Phase II trials plus their current testosterone drug with impending results, expect announcements every few months that could significantly affect the price of this stock (both good and bad).


&amp;nbsp;


 As mentioned above, I hope their testosterone results come back poor so I can double or triple down on my current investment. Right now I'm in at $2.65. Please feel free to tell me why I'm an idiot.

### Introduction

This is a primer about Valeant ($VRX). It will expire and become obsolete upon the release of updated Valeant financial statements, which could happen any day, though is supposed to happen before the 29th of April. *Right now, this is a guide into possibly taking advantage of the uncertainty around Valeant, which has depressed the stock.*

Valeant ($VRX) is probably the only time that I have seen [/r/investing](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing), [/r/wallstreetbets](http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets), and buy side research like [Morningstar](http://www.morningstar.com/) actually agree with one another. Morningstar [rates it as 5 stars](http://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/vrx/quote.html) as of this release date (April 18, 2016). This is so infrequent that it is like having an alignment of the planets.

When I see overlapping worlds get excited, I immediately want to know the story. Over a weekend, I began pulling together all of the different sources and piecing together as much as I could in a limited amount of time.

It is not intended as a replacement for commentary by a CFA (which can be found [here](http://analysisreport.morningstar.com/stock/research?t=VRX&amp;region=usa&amp;culture=en-US&amp;HID=QUO_STK118), (subscription required)), rather, it is a quick and dirty attempt to explain, in ordinary language, what the company does, how it makes money, who are the players involved, and what are some catalysts for its past fall and its future rise.

If you want to dig deeper and do more homework, this will kick it off. Use my work in addition to your own work or methods, and let's make some money. We are *all* trying to figure this one out before things are released, and where there's uncertainty, there's always opportunity.

###Valeant Pharmaceuticals International - The Basics

####What Does It Do?

Valeant is a large cap pharmaceutical company. The company's business model involves purchasing other mature companies that have had a successful track record for its portfolio, and then distributing that company's products. It has been [described as the Berkshire Hathaway](http://fortune.com/2015/05/04/bill-ackman-valeant-could-be-next-berkshire-hathaway/) of pharma. Others have compared it to [""Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball), a book that discusses how baseball teams can gain a significant competitive edge by hand-picking players from a pool of candidates who only have the [winning qualities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabermetrics) which make them, statistically, most likely to succeed.

Valeant differs from other large cap pharma companies in terms of how research and development for new products is done. A typical pharma company does its own research and development in-house. Upon approval to sell the drug, the company shifts the drug over to the manufacturing/sales/marketing side of its business. In contrast, at Valeant, when the company is acquired, the less cost-effective, expensive features (e.g., research and development) are removed, leaving only the revenue generating features. Valeant doesn't do its own R&amp;D -- it has others do it for them.

The reason this business model has been successful is because it allows focus and specialization. The founders of small R&amp;D pharma research companies are generally not interested in building an empire around their inventions. They want to stick to their research roots, what they enjoy, and be acquired by a larger company with deep pockets. They are researchers, not marketers or salespeople -- and they don't want to be. They want to cash out and move onto the next exciting thing. 

In contrast, Valeant, by having an extensive portfolio, is designed to be able to specialize in handling what happens after the R&amp;D is finished. By handling the actual manufacturing, marketing, selling, and support of the product that was developed, they can build the necessary infrastructure around the product to make it a success.

This business model worked so well that Valeant shares had [returned in excess of 2,300%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Michael_Pearson#Career) since 2008 until 2015, making Valeant the ""most valuable"" and the best performer on the Toronto Stock Exchange. In fact, Valeant was the [largest Canadian company](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/10/21/valeant-shares-halted-citron-enron_n_8347766.html) as of early to mid-2015.

####Why is its Portfolio Special?

As a global company, the brands and products in Valeant's portfolio are distributed worldwide. The company is big enough that it would be a part of the S&amp;P 500 if Valeant were American (Valeant is a Canadian company). The point being, it's a big company with a big portfolio.

Like Berkshire Hathaway, there is defensiveness in maintaining a diverse portfolio. The company is less reliant on a single product or service becoming a success or failing. There is room for products to become unprofitable and age out. This is a large plus for a potential Valeant investor.

The portfolio of Valeant's brands is quite wide. Depending on where one lives in the world, the brands can be seen in television advertisements or in the grocery store: Bausch &amp; Lomb, Boston, CeraVe, and Cortaid, to name a few.

Aside from consumer brands, [here is a list of actual pharma drugs](http://www.drugs.com/manufacturer/valeant-pharmaceuticals-international-147.html) that Valeant is behind. There are also a lot of easily recognized names in here: Wellbutrin, Retin-A (acne medication), Jublia, and Ativan, for example.

Most experts would agree that Valeant's portfolio is its most valuable asset. The commentary about Valeant's strength that I have read often mentions its severely undervalued, carefully cultivated portfolio. The investment thesis is this: if this portfolio makes Valeant money with bad management, imagine what it could do with great management.

####How Does It Make Money?

As mentioned, Valeant sells the products of its acquired former companies. This is not entirely exciting nor controversial. It's combining and sharing resources to cut costs in the manufacturing. It's figuring out marketing and training a salesforce. It's the re-use of equipment, real estate, and facilities that are very capex and/or labor intensive. It makes a lot of sense.

Aside from cutting costs, money is also made by raising prices after acquisition. This practice is normal, regardless of industry, as it is natural for nervous companies to want to recoup their costs as quickly as possible. For example, when Disney acquired Star Wars, it immediately switched into high gear with marketing and licensing while filling its pipeline with blockbuster movies, in fact, [one per year until 2019](http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/star-wars/241723/full-star-wars-movie-release-calendar) from the Star Wars universe.

However, the practice became controversial after Turing CEO [Martin Shkreli went viral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Shkreli#Price_hike_controversy) for acquiring the drug Daraprim and turning it from a $13.50 pill to a $750 pill, an eye-watering 5,556% increase that produced instant outrage. 

Valeant CEO J. Michael Pearson later commented on the controversy by saying that he only expected prices to go up [modestly, in the single digits](http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/valeant-earnings-drug-prices-1.3278124) in 2016.

It is worth noting that, for most people, insurance can often pay the difference in a price hike. In reading comments people have written about Valeant ""price hikes"", it is clear that most people do not actually understand what they are paying or not paying, but they are upset about the concept. People with insurance have copays, so they often do not notice price hikes. For everyone else, there's the American Healthcare Proxy Fight. More on that in a bit.

In the case of consumer products sold in the grocery store where people do pay cash, they can be marketed as premium consumer products to capture higher margins.

####What are Some Possible Catalysts Happening This Month?

In the next two installments, which I will post over the next two days, we will discuss the past and the future of Valeant by focusing on its management. However, to end this installment, here are some catalysts investors are watching for *this month*:

1. A possible new CEO announcement
2. CEO Pearson leaving, formally
3. The accounting for last year, being submitted and audited
4. Analysts reviewing the submitted data in detail and updating their outlooks
5. Pearson is called before Congress (this will generate some negative publicity for Valeant). More about this tomorrow.
6. A possible announcement of a strategic asset sale to liquidate debt and/or a strategy around paying down and restructuring debt

All of these, to some degree, eliminate uncertainty. Uncertainty in the near-term creates volatility. Many new investors to Valeant are anticipating that the elimination of that uncertainty, if one or more of these catalysts is executed successfully, will generate a large jump in the stock.

####Tomorrow

In our next installment, we will cover, in detail, catalysts for why Valeant's stock was depressed so much during 2015-2016. We will review how CEO J. Michael Pearson, once a superstar, became sloppy and was fired.

And, in Wednesday's installment, we will focus on the future -- new management, new ideas, and fresh thinking. We'll become familiar with the legendary hedge fund manager who bet $1B on Valeant and took the seat of the fired CFO on the Board of Directors, determined to make Valeant a success because his legendary reputation now depends on it.",29

WHAT IT DOES

Match Group, a subsidiary of IAC/InterActiveCorp, owns a market-leading portfolio of online dating services, including Match.com, OkCupid, and Tinder.

Match Group is the leader in online dating, with several of the industry's most popular services.
Tinder is a global phenomenon, having facilitated over 8 billion romantic match-ups — while still early in its maturity.
Despite fast-growing user and subscriber counts, the stock is attractively valued.

Talk About MTCH 

Data as of 4/12/16. Dollar amounts in millions except recent price.

There are no guarantees when it comes to finding someone special, but at least the internet has a lot of places where you can look. You could sign up for a traditional dating service like Match.com. Maybe you want something that skews a bit younger, like OkCupid, or something for older singles, like OurTime. You might be looking for a more focused search, like BlackPeopleMeet. Or maybe you're not looking for someone special so much as someone new, and you just want a ""hook-up"" app like Tinder or Twoo.

Each of these sites has its own spin on matchmaking, but they're all owned by one corporate Cupid: Match Group (NASDAQ: MTCH). Match, spun out of media mogul Barry Diller's holding company IAC/InterActiveCorp (NASDAQ: IAC) in an IPO last November, has a portfolio of more than 45 brands encompassing many of the world's top dating sites (as well as college prep service Princeton Review — getting into school is another way to find a date, right?).

Does it seem strange that I'd recommend a service whose most satisfied customers may never use it again? Don't underestimate the size of the dating pool as more and more people look for love online. According to Pew Research Center, about 59% of U.S. adults surveyed in 2015 said online dating was a good way to meet people — up from 44% in 2005. Meanwhile, Pew found that 15% of U.S. adults had used an online dating site in 2015, up from 11% just two years earlier. What's more, I think Match does have a path to strong repeat business as Tinder catches fire.

Match is the leader in a growing market, and I think it will do more than flirt with success.

More Than a Pretty Face

It's easy to see why IAC spun out Match (and then kept a big ownership stake): Match was by far the fastest-growing business in IAC's portfolio, boasting 12.7% compounded revenue growth over the past three years. And there's plenty of reason to expect this growth to continue: Match estimates that its addressable market of single Internet users in North America, Western Europe, and select other countries will reach 672 million in 2019, up from around 511 million today. Although Match boasted about 59 million monthly active users as of Sept. 30, and has around 4.6 million paying subscribers, that's just a drop in the bucket.

In fact, subscribers (which the company calls paid member count, or PMC) have been climbing at a solid clip — about 14% annually since 2012 and 18.5% in just the past year. Monthly active users have come in even more quickly, swelling at a 63% annual pace between 2011 and the third quarter of 2015.

You may have noticed that these user and subscriber figures have increased faster than revenue. There are two main reasons for that: Members have been moving to less expensive services in the portfolio, particularly Tinder, and the strong dollar has been a financial drag on results in Europe (where the company saw 31% growth in PMC in 2015). The latter will improve along with European currencies, and the former points to the hidden depths of Match's cross-selling opportunities.

Tinder was initially a free service created by IAC's Hatch Labs in 2012. Even if you've never used it, you may still know how it works, because it's entered the pop-culture lexicon: Swipe right on someone's photo if you like them, and swipe left if you don't. By 2014, Tinder was registering 1 billion swipes per day. So in the fourth quarter of that year, the company switched it to a subscription service, but it kept the pricing much lower than services like Match.com, not wanting to disturb the mass appeal that made the app such a phenomenon. Those pricing experiments are ongoing — it currently charges people over 29 twice as much as the youngsters, and price varies by geography. I believe Tinder is likely to find more pricing power over time, particularly for new features that avid users want.

Tinder may also serve as a front end for a lifelong relationship between Match Group and its customers. Tinder appeals very much to younger people, particularly those not necessarily seeking a serious relationship. But as users grow older and look to settle down, or at least find something longer-term, they will naturally gravitate toward services that Match can promote and incentivize, like Match.com and OkCupid (which is free at a basic level but requires a subscription for premium features).

A Cheap Date

Match has much in common with some of Diller's other great successes, like TripAdvisor (NASDAQ: TRIP) and Expedia (NASDAQ: EXPE): It's another scalable Internet platform that costs fairly little to operate and can produce enormous profits. The company trades at only 14.1 times the $180 million in free cash flow it produced in 2015 (and 16 times trailing earnings per share). Before the IPO, analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch valued Tinder at $1.35 billion as a standalone business, but said a more optimistic scenario could make it worth $3 billion. Today, we can buy Match's entire portfolio of more than 45 brands for less than $2.6 billion (not including debt). And that's despite Tinder showing solid performance in the company's inaugural earnings report.

I think Wall Street is overly concerned about declines in average revenue per user as the company adapts to the enormous opportunity that is Tinder and fits it in with its other services. Like other Internet platforms, Match has been buffeted by the switch from desktop to mobile. Overall, this has benefited the company — Tinder, for example, is a mobile-only platform — but it has posed some of the conversion challenges that other online businesses have seen, as Match seeks to turn massive numbers of browsers into paying subscribers. This, too, I expect to settle out in the quarters ahead.

Risks and When We'd Sell

Match Group owns a broad swath of top online dating sites, but it hardly has a monopoly — it competes with well-established sites like eHarmony, up-and-comers like Zoosk, and various niche services like ChristianMingle, JDate, SingleParentMeet, and many more. The barriers to entry are low, and Match needs to keep up with competitive features, continue acquiring competitors, or both.

Meanwhile, the company's PMC growth is coming largely from Tinder, as well as the recent acquisition of Plenty of Fish. Without these, subscriber numbers are fairly flat. Thus, even though Match has a diverse portfolio of services, a lot is riding on the continued popularity of Tinder in particular. While it has been remarkably successful, the model is fairly new.

Match carries a substantial debt load, with a current ratio of 0.6 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 433%. Much of its debt is from a term loan due in 2022, and its obligations should be readily managed from cash flow for the next several years, but the company has a large balance due in 2022 that may require refinancing (and since it carries variable interest, the company's obligations could change).

Finally, note that IAC still owns about 85% of the company — so as shareholders, we are at the whim the company's corporate parent. While we assume Diller and his colleagues will seek to maximize the value of the stock, if we find our interests are at cross-purposes, it's clear who's in charge of this relationship.

 The Foolish Bottom Line

It's hard to put a price on love, which is why so many different dating services, with so many price points, have thrived in the Internet era. Match Group boasts an unmatched portfolio of top sites, and it's producing lots of high-margin cash flow even as it experiments with optimal pricing. Whether you love Match Group or just like the look of it, it's worth courting the company at this price.",1

Perhaps it's fitting that my team and I (Tom here) are making our second recommendation of TripAdvisor (NASDAQ: TRIP) this month, because we've been revisiting a lot of our favorite investment ideas lately. Three of our past four recommendations have come from our current stable of stocks, as well as five of the past 13.

We don't lack for new ideas. In fact, we're brimming with them. But our job every month is to give you our very best idea for new investments, and there are no bonus points for novelty. In fact, an opportune purchase of a well-studied current holding often beats a flashy new idea — that's why we keep quoting Peter Lynch's well-worn saying that the best stock to buy may be one you already own. And with 69 companies already under coverage as active recommendations, we have plenty of ideas in our knowledge base.

Take one look at TripAdvisor in particular and you'll see why we're so excited to book a return trip. It has so many of my favorite traits in a business: growing sales, founder-leadership, a tribe of loyal customers, and a solid balance sheet. And since our original recommendation, the company has made significant progress: It's increased its user-generated database, grown sales, added an important new feature in Instant Booking, and made major strides in mobile. Without a doubt, it's a more valuable business than it was last March, when we first recommended it. Yet the stock is down almost 30% since then. This looks like a five-star opportunity.

A Trip Down Memory Lane

If we boiled a TripAdvisor investment down to one phrase, it would have to be ""network effect"" — that powerful and sustainable dynamic whereby each new consumer adds more value to every other consumer of the service. TripAdvisor's network effect comes from a particularly strong competitive advantage: The world's largest repository of user-generated reviews covers just about every hotel, vacation rental, tourist attraction, and restaurant on earth, reaching 350 million users a month with its 290 million reviews. This ever-growing hoard of content attracts a growing base of travelers who read reviews, plan their trips, and book their own hotels, flights, and excursions.

That booking step is where the rubber meets the road in online travel. To date, TripAdvisor has done well linking its user base with properties and online travel agencies (OTAs) like The Priceline Group  (NASDAQ: PCLN) or Expedia (NASDAQ: EXPE) through an advertising-based sales model. But this has two important weaknesses:

First, users have a disjointed experience researching on one website but purchasing on another, which dampens conversion rates.
Second, TripAdvisor loses out when users book elsewhere without clicking through its links to a property or OTA's website. The leakage is impossible to calculate but presumably huge.
TripAdvisor believes (and we wholeheartedly agree) that a smoother path from researching to planning to booking will result in happier users, a stickier site, stronger relationships with its partners, and ultimately better monetization of its valuable content.

Enter Instant Booking.

Visiting New Territory

Instant Booking allows users to see available rooms, compare rates, and lock in their reservations, all within the same browser page (or app). TripAdvisor only finished rolling out the feature to its global user base late last year, yet already 10% of Instant Booking users are repeat customers. And given the participation of Priceline (and its industry-leading global hotel inventory), along with eight of the top 10 hotel chains, we're reassured that partners see this as a mutually beneficial partnership, rather than the threat naysayers predicted. Looks like a plus so far, and we see no reason users — and revenue — won't continue to grow.

But Instant Booking is also going to complicate TripAdvisor's financials in the short term, which is part of our Foolish opportunity. Unlike TripAdvisor's meta search feature, which racks up revenue every time someone clicks on a featured link, Instant Booking only brings in money when users complete their hotel stays. TripAdvisor can charge a higher commission for Instant Booking because it's more valuable to partners, but that revenue might take a while to hit the books — meaning revenue growth might look less impressive the next few quarters. More on this in the next section, but the bottom line is that if you temper your short-term expectations, we think you'll be rewarded in the long term.

Along the same lines, TripAdvisor is working on getting more value out of its mobile traffic. Like many sites, TripAdvisor is finding mobile to be its fastest-growing channel — it accounted for half of total traffic in 2015. However, it's only contributing about 30% of the users who plan to book a trip rather than just browse (the company refers to them as ""shoppers""). Improving this figure could be a win for TripAdvisor in two ways: First, mobile users are cheaper to acquire because they tend to get to the app organically, not through paid links; and second, those mobile shoppers use Instant Booking more than desktop shoppers.

How Will They Be Paying?

TripAdvisor's financials look slightly less attractive than they did when we first recommended the stock: Growth has tapered off a bit to 25% annually over the last five years, while the operating margin has pared back to about 16% from almost 30% at the end of 2014. That's not the trend we typically prefer for a re-recommendation. But this is where we think the market is missing the larger context. Take Instant Booking: The muted short-term growth I mentioned above is accompanied by the expense of building out this new feature, a sad combination unless you factor in the long-term payoff of making it easier for travelers to spend their money with TripAdvisor.

It's safe to say that 2016 will be a transitional year for TripAdvisor, with roughly 10% revenue growth and earnings growth slower than that. However, it's an important year for management to focus on revenue per hotel shopper (the hotel segment divided by visitors who view listings of hotels or a specific hotel page). Up till now, the metric has bounced around a bit. However, I fully expect to see it trend up more consistently, reflecting increased conversion and higher average commissions as more people book on the site. As that happens, I expect annualized revenue growth around 20% over the next five years, and I expect a net margin around 20% by the end of that period. That should produce about $4.80 in earnings per share, which, at a pared-back multiple of 25, is a double from the current price, or about 15% a year.

Risks and When We'd Sell

Last year, we noted that big customer concentration — 46% of advertising sales come from Priceline and Expedia — posed big risks as TripAdvisor potentially transitioned from partner to competitor with its built-in booking initiative. With Priceline having signed on as TripAdvisor's largest Instant Booking partner, that risk has abated for now. But relying heavily on larger and more powerful partners will remain a central concern as alliances in the online travel business continue to twist and turn.

Speaking of partners turning into competitors, TripAdvisor investors will also need to watch consolidation and competition among the large hotel property managers and owners. Marriott International  (NASDAQ: MAR) is about to acquire Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide  (NYSE: HOT), and the company is already providing preferential pricing to loyalty members who book directly on Marriott's website. That trend is likely of little immediate consequence (TripAdvisor and the rest of the industry make the vast majority of their volumes and sales from smaller independent properties, not the big hotel chains), but it's one more indication that we'll need to monitor any worrying trends in user growth, traffic acquisition costs, and ultimately profit margins as this intensely competitive industry gets more so.

Finally, TripAdvisor's unusual ownership structure poses both risks and opportunities. The company is, of course, publicly traded, but a separate company, Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings (NASDAQ: LTRPA), holds 21% of shares, with supervoting stock giving it 56% of the vote. Greg Maffei is chairman and controlling shareholder of both companies. To the extent that he and TripAdvisor co-founder and CEO Steve Kaufer have strategy disagreements or misaligned interests, it's possible minority shareholders will get caught in the crossfire. For now, we're very comfortable with Maffei, who has a long history of maximizing shareholder value in the telecom, internet, and media industries.

The Foolish Bottom Line

Just as travelers know they can trust TripAdvisor to help them plan the perfect trip, Foolish investors can trust Kaufer and team to expand TripAdvisor's reach and revenue, with great potential returns down the road. Here at Stock Advisor, we'll take that over a tacky souvenir T-shirt any day.",1

 **CATALYST:** PDUFA April 30, 2016 for Eclat #3

 **Why is this one of the safest biopharm to get behind?**
 There is no such thing as a guarantee, but this drug WILL get FDA Approval. FLML four years ago acquired Eclat Pharma which had 4 ""unapproved but marketed"" drugs. ""

* These are drugs that have been in use so long that they pre-date the FDA approval regulations. When a company carries out the appropriate studies to gain approval of these older drugs, the FDA removes the unapproved versions of the drug sold by other companies.

The first two of these drugs already got FDA approval. Bloxiverz, the first drug to be positive, is the sole reason FLML is net positive right now (Vazculep is the other) 

 FLML is not disclosing the third drug because it wants to keep the competition to a minimal. UNDERSTAND THIS DRUG IS ALREADY USED COMMONLY TODAY, BUT NO PHARMA HAS GONE THROUGH THE EXPENSIVE REGULATIONS TO APPROVE IT

16-04-18,4ferug,Record your stock predictions/evaluations here.,"So I come to /r/investing a lot to get opinions on what markets to go bull/bear on, as well as get tips from people on how to evaluate companies.  Frankly, though, I am interested in finding out the percentage of posters that are talking out their ass, and the investors who know what they are doing.

If you would allow me, I would love to record your stock predictions for the next week through to the next, lets say, 6 months to compare them with the actual data.  Your prediction could be as broad as ""Gold will rise in the next three months"" to ""TSLA will top out at 280 in about a month and then drop to 240 in the following months before settling out.""

I will record this data, and if this post gains popularity, I could make a followup when 6 months is up.

I believe this experiment would help to give some perspective on trusting online forums to new investors.  If, for example, a normalized portfolio betting on these predictions were to lose more than they gain, or under perform the market, it would show that you shouldn't simply bet on what you read, and that even if people research stocks and make educated predictions, they can still be very wrong.  Likewise (if the portfolio goes up, or outperform the market) it could show that with careful evaluation and studies, that the majority of novice investors can beat the market, at least in this 6 month example.

What I'm looking for is a platform that allows me to put a trailing stop on an option. I want this trailing stop to be based on the bid ask spread though. Not on the last price executed. Ideally I would like this trailing stop to depend on the a number 40-50% from the bid to the ask number.


An example if you don't understand,
ABC options had a last price of $7, but a current bid price of $5.5 and $6.5. Now this option has a value of $6 or less, but most stop limits are based off the $7 last price. So they won't execute until a sale is made. With the possibility of it dropping even further there isn't a way to control the losses.

If you answered ""yes"" to any of the above questions or recognized some of the words then you sound like a perfect candidate to invest in the new ultra-volatile security, aptly named, **""Yolo's Regret"" $FAG**.


Created by a group of faggots who just finished watching The Big Short, this exchange traded fund is meant for serious investors only. Put down that Morgan Stanley prospectus and pick up the latest issue of Boat Enthusiast because your financial security will never be the same ever again.

&amp;nbsp;

**Yolo's Regret seeks to provide investment results that correspond to the inverse average price and yield performance of several different securities pivotal to the global economy; DWTI, UDOW, SPXS, LABD and of course SUNE**. 

&amp;nbsp;

This was designed to capture the modern Machiavellian day trader's attention. The underlying securities are staples of every smart investor's portfolio as well as /r/wallstreetbets lore. 


*[DWTI](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=DWTI) gives you the right to post in every thread dealing with oil*

*[UDOW](http://finance.yahoo.com/q;_ylt=AiyHxXlp1KY9cBVXRDd2VdNzAcAF?uhb=uhb2&amp;fr=uh3_finance_vert_gs_ctrl2_e&amp;type=2button&amp;s=UDOW) provides an edgy alternative to the average-joe optimistic view of the market*

*[SPXS](http://finance.yahoo.com/q;_ylt=AiyHxXlp1KY9cBVXRDd2VdNzAcAF?uhb=uhb2&amp;fr=uh3_finance_vert_gs_ctrl2_e&amp;type=2button&amp;s=SPXS) sounds sexy*

*[LABD](http://finance.yahoo.com/q;_ylt=AiyHxXlp1KY9cBVXRDd2VdNzAcAF?uhb=uhb2&amp;fr=uh3_finance_vert_gs_ctrl2_e&amp;type=2button&amp;s=LABD) ensures every investor has at least the tip of their dick in healthcare*

Yolo's Regret ($FAG) operates much like a ~~traditional~~ *boring* 3x Inverse ETF but is vastly superior for several reasons:

- Do you actually want the market to go up? I'm not sure either.

- In one move you can throw your money into several toilets at once. You'll have a diversified portfolio in 1 trade!

- Never again fear that some idiot on Robinhood will have more volatility.

- Maximum [yacht](https://www.yoloboatrentals.com/wp-content/uploads/azimut-83-yacht-yolo-boat-rentals-min-462x285.jpg) potential, minimum mom's basement potential.

- Never again have a boring day watching the market! Your money will ALWAYS move^down^into^a^ditch
&amp;nbsp;

Will the market ever go up again? Will the market ever go down again? Shit, I don't know. In 10 years when Hollywood makes a new Wall Street movie, its gonna be called ""Regrets of a Yolo'er"". Do you want that movie to be about you?

To catch you up on the story so far: 
These GSE's got bailed out in 2008. The gov got to oversee them and take 10%. As of 2012, these giants became real companies again with enough liquidity to be stable and generate a profit. At this point the conservatorship should have ended. Instead 100% of their profits went straight to the Treasury and the Housing people. Recently, documents have been exposed that show the feds in charge were aware that these GSE's were viable. 

On Friday, there was a hearing in front of a three judge panel. The main argument is that the government has illegally turned their conservation duties into total ownership and nationalization. 

The narrative boils down to this: a bunch of politicians thought they could fleece bankers. Hedge funds have bought up the very valuable shares cheaply while waiting for the perfect political moment to strike. Where do you think that $100 billion went? Wanna bet that if Freddie and Fannie don't end up back in the shareholders' hands some of that money can be traced to Libya or Syria? This fight makes ""game of thrones"" look like Dr. Seuss. 

The lawyers from the banks are hitters, the feds trip all over themselves. Load up on equity or calls if you feel lucky (it's hard to predict legal timing).

Here is the full hearing: https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/recordings/recordings2016.nsf/74B30C9776477AA885257F96006585FE/$file/14-5243.mp3",12

Each day that they don't announce bankruptcy is a positive sign. It means that its very likely they are working on a deal. 

If the rumors are true they are going to sell off their India assets and that will more than cover their cash needs. So for arguments sake, lets say this is the most likely scenario going forward. Where do you see the share price going? I think $2 is pretty reasonable. 

I really don't think this is as much of a gamble as people are making it out to seem. Bankruptcy would have been announced by now if that was the only option.

I spoke with IR for CHMA on the phone today. The stock still has potential with the FDA review meeting. They have a lot of data, and could possibly submit based on subset or bioindicator analysis and get passed, but this is unlikely.

This is not a time to invest in this company at all, however, given all the data, the drug still has potential to be approved months, if not years down the road.

Following the FDA review meeting, it will be a good chance to decide whether to make any small (albeit speculative) investment in the company.

I'm sure you don't, because a month ago you were too busy losing all of daddys money on UWTI or DUST or some other shit. Luckily, I've got the recap for you.

Seadrill is an offshore oil service company that hasn't been doing that great in this market and that's why every hedge fund on wallstreet decided to short that shit.

Look here:

http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/sdrl/short-interest

You know what happened? Seadrill happens to be have a big shareholder who goes by the name John Fredriksen. John just happends to be the richest motherfucker in Norway, good for something like $12 billion. Or, about 200 more yachts than you'll ever see in your lifetime. Back in the beginning of March, he decided to free up a little capital by selling shares in his salmon farming business. The rumor spread that he was freeing up capital to pour into Seadrill and save the business. That hypothetical rumor made the stock skyrocket harder than the fucking Apollo 11.

Source:

http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/07/seadrill-faces-the-mother-of-all-short-squeezes.html

Anyway, why am I telling you faggots this? Because it's gonna happen again, but it's not Seadrill this time. It's another company called Transocean (RIG). It's the baby that gave us the classic wonder of the modern world known as the Deepwater Horizon.

Look at this beauty:

http://www.investing.com/equities/transocea-ltd

http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/rig/short-interest

http://markets.ft.com/research/Markets/Tearsheets/Summary?s=RIG:NYQ


Daily volume: 21m shares

Short interest: 118m shares

Free float: 364m shares


We're talking the mother of all short squeezes. Almost 30% of the free float is shorted. ANY rumor that this shit will be saved is gonna send this stock through the roof. We're talking 500+% gains here. And you know what's gonna make that shit fly? Same fucking thing as last time. Carl _motherfucking_ Icahn owns a big stake in this company, and I'm pretty sure that he, if anyone, is ready to protect his own interests.

Anyway, this motherfucker is about to blow up. When? I don't fucking know. The lower oil goes, the quicker it's gonna pop. I've dipped in already, I suggest you do the same if you're tired of borrowing your moms Prius and ready to pick up that Ferrari.

Also, bear in mind that this is a YOLO. It could hypothetically go the other way.

16-04-19,4fgkyu,"What's everyones favorite emerging market currently?","With equity pricing looking ""frothy"" in the current environment at least within the US, are any other investors looking to diversify their holdings into emerging markets? 

For the past few months and the rest of 2016 I plan on holding EWZ (Long Brazil) especially with the governmental changes and the current commodity cycle that we are experiencing. With a 12.5 forward P/E ratio and a current deflationary period, I believe EWZ is poised to add to its 35% YTD gains, especially if a conservative is elected into Brazilian office. 

Another ETF thats very interesting to me is SMIN (India Small Cap). As a very diversified ETF in another deflationary environment, if interest rates were to follow inflation downwards there stands an interesting opportunity for the indian mid-cap market. At 1/5th the size of the Chinese economy, while it is clear that India has a large ceiling when it comes to economic growth, the question is how and when this can be achieved. 

Very interested if anyone else has interesting emerging markets that can be taken into account, or specific metrics that they use in helping to valuate emerging markets besides the classics (eg; Schiller P/E, GDP, etc.)   ",24

It's the moment you've all been waiting for. Here are the results for Round/Month 1, [see for yourself](http://imgur.com/LR1RuN3).  
  
So as you can see, these 20 stocks made me a 7.35% profit.  It's more that SPY and it's more than SPXL(SPY bull 3x). Granted, this month was pretty bullish, but I think I did pretty well.  
  
Here is a breakdown of the profit/loss  
  

Rank|Ticker|P/L|
:--|:--|:--|
1|ARLP|29.40%|
2 | SDLP | 27.55% |  
3 | PDLI | 20.26%  
4 | AHGP | 18.43%  
5 | HQL | 12.99%  
6 | NE | 12.55%  
7 | HNRG | 9.26%

17 | AEL | -0.64%  
18 | CIG (poor guy was #1 at one point) | -1.42%  
19 | WDC | -13.14%  
20 | WSCI (gave me hell all month) | -21.30%  
  
I have decided to the reverse stock roulette where I reinvest the top 3 into the bottom 3.  
So the winners are ARLP, SDLP and PDLI! However they will now be sacrificed to the almighty CIG, WDC and WSCI.

16-04-18,4fe49j,"Question Regarding Backtesting &amp; the Finance Industry as a Whole","Few things before I ask my question: 1) Very limited knowledge of stock trading 2) Won't be able to provide too much specific info regarding the backtesting done in my question.

So I'm a senior in college soon to graduate. Yesterday a friend of mine who is a finance major told me about a mutual acquaintance who has developed an investment strategy that when backtested has yielded very good results. The average return was like 52%. Again, I don't know much about investing so I'm assuming this is very good, but you'll have to tell me. Well anyways, apparently this person has decided to forgo his plan of grad school and denied an offer from a small hedge fund in order to start his own investment firm. I've been told he has $300,000 in seed money. I don't know much about this kid, but I do know his parents are extremely rich. 

So my questions are these: 

1) Are those returns, if correctly stated by me above, really great? My Dad is in finance and was a bit non-committal on things. He said that they are impressive but backtesting doesn't necessarily mean his strategy will work in future years. 

2) I believe he was using Compustat (could be wrong but it sounded like that was the name) as well as some other program to do these tests. It sounded like you could go into this program, pick any number of factors, and then backtest and tweak until you get to a really high number. Is this assumption wrong? Not to take away anything from this person, but it sounds like if you have a decent background in finance and are committed to the process of trial and error, what he did wasn't spectacularly impressive. Again I have no idea how all this works so if I'm simplifying things tell me. 

3) The $300,000 in seed money is the part of the story that seems the sketchiest to me. I'm not totally sure if this money is going to be managed by him or if it will be used to start his company. I know $300,000 is a lot of money, but $300,000 under management would be a very small amount, correct? So if the money is going towards starting the company, and is not to be invested and managed by him, who is investing it? I mentioned his family is very rich so my first thought was that that is his source. I just don't see why actual investors would put up $300,000 without him having any background working in the industry. 

Once again I apologize if I haven't provided enough info. This is all I got. ",3

16-04-19,4fjgou,IAG - A low capital/risk trade,"So, I sold a long dated put 3.00 on IAG probably 8 months ago to a year ago and was put shares at this price. Its finally in the green. What I did now is, I sold an ATM call at my avg share price. This yields me 10% for the year, assuming I can take out all my cash in the end. If I were to just sell and take all my cash out, i'd have 4.5% profit.

Do I know whether this company will go bust? nope. It might. I'm betting that it won't just because of cycles. It trended down along with the GLD index - which IMO has not made any sort of recovery yet. It might never, but that's just part of the game.

Plan is to continually try to sell calls against this stock to lower my cost. If i can do this another 10 times at the similar premium, i'll effectively have a 100% return.

SO how you can play this. There hasn't really been a sustained rally in gold, and I'm sure people expect this to happen at some point. IAG will cost you about $300 in capital.

What you can do is - sell an ATM put near expiration, with a high expectance of being put the stock and at the same time sell a NTM call a month further out to futher reduce your cost basis.  

The outcome - If you've been put stock.

1) It goes down. - You close your call for premium and look to open another contract closer to your break even.

2) it goes up. You make your profit on the short call being recovered.

Worst case scenario is you have to cover your short call before being put the shares due to the stock skyrocketing. Chances of this happening? probably close to 0%. Another way to hedge this is to put a limit order to buy the stock at your break even price.

Good luck hunting.",2

First, I want to say when it comes to stocks, I know way less than I should about valuation and was hoping some of you could point me in the right direction as far as target prices and formulas to determine value.

Second, I would love to hear from anyone else in B4 about how much your firm handcuffs your portfolio and if I should consider this prior to my start date (I want to be long in most, if not all of my positions, but will have to sell some stocks before my start date for independence purposes).

Finally, I should probably note that while I want to hold for long positions, I am looking for pretty aggressive growth considering my age.

* Goldman Sachs laying off 10% in investment banking. Bank of American and JP Morgan also doing layoffs

* IBM reports worst revenue in 14 years

* Netflix projects weak growth guidance for 2016

* Intel gave weaker than expected revenue guidance for Q2

* Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Bank of America - All reported losses in Q1 2016

I have recently developed a quantitative strategy that generates serious alpha with a sharpe ratio that exceeds 3. 

I want to start my own hedge fund. I have several quantitative strategies as well as a niche fundamental knowledge across multiple markets. I would like to launch the fund around the quantitative strategies whilst also run relative value trades based on fundamentals. 

Problem is, I don't have a large amount of capital.

I bought the minimum required to purchase VFNIX through vanguard for $3,000. Most of thier mutual funds require 3, 5, or 10K minimum investments. I was wanting to diversify my portfolio and did not think it would be smart to put the other 3K i had into another index fund. That would mean all of my money is in two funds, not very diversified even if the funds are invested in many different stocks. 


I was looking at other funds that track indexes like SPY500 when I thought of BRK.B as an alternative. Can anyone see why it would not be the smartest move to put 20-35% of my funds in BRK.B? from what I can tell its basically a index fund, but it just follows the smartest investor of all time.

They no longer have the capability of meeting obligations with the fall in coal prices.

What I want to know is how similar is this scenario to the AA bankruptcy situation many years ago? How likely is it that the shareholders will be completely wiped out? 

Seems like it's bankruptcy to restructure and renegotiate terms, if they can hold onto their profitable assets, not liquidate everything like I'm sure thr creditors want, I think the stock would skyrocket... However I'm not familiar with this industry, I can't understand the risk levels like I did with AA.  I knew as an insider in the transportation industry that the AA bankruptcy was for renegotiating obligations because having a strong, profitable business, they were going to decimate.

### Introduction (again)

This is a primer about Valeant ($VRX). It will expire and become obsolete upon the release of updated Valeant financial statements, which could happen any day, though is supposed to happen before the 29th of April. *Right now, this is a guide into possibly taking advantage of the uncertainty around Valeant, which has depressed the stock.*

Valeant ($VRX) is probably the only time that I have seen [/r/investing](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing), [/r/wallstreetbets](http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets), and buy side research like [Morningstar](http://www.morningstar.com/) actually agree with one another. Morningstar [rates it as 5 stars](http://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/vrx/quote.html) as of this release date (April 19, 2016). This is so infrequent that it is like having an alignment of the planets.

When I see overlapping worlds get excited, I immediately want to know the story. Over a weekend, I began pulling together all of the different sources and piecing together as much as I could in a limited amount of time.

It is not intended as a replacement for commentary by a CFA (which can be found [here](http://analysisreport.morningstar.com/stock/research?t=VRX&amp;region=usa&amp;culture=en-US&amp;HID=QUO_STK118), (subscription required)), rather, it is a quick and dirty attempt to explain, in ordinary language, what the company does, how it makes money, who are the players involved, and what are some catalysts for its past fall and its future rise.

If you want to dig deeper and do more homework, this will kick it off. Use my work in addition to your own work or methods, and let's make some money. We are *all* trying to figure this one out before things are released, and where there's uncertainty, there's always opportunity.

### Thesis
My position is to buy before the catalysts. Once catalysts [mentioned here in Part 1: The Basics](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/4fbqyd/part_1_valeant_vrx_due_diligence_and_analysis/) start to happen, uncertainty will be removed. When uncertainty is removed through management changes, realignments of strategy, asset sales, cost cutting, etc., a depressed stock can have significant upward pressure.

###*2015-2016: Lots of Investors Balking in Little Time*

####**Five Big Catalysts for the Stock's Plunge**

Between 2015-2016, the stock plunged from $262/share (August 2015) to $33/share, where it is today (April 2016). That's an almost 90% loss. Morningstar's analyst, Michael Waterhouse, says [the stock's fair market value](http://analysisreport.morningstar.com/stock/research?t=VRX&amp;culture=en-US&amp;region=usa&amp;HID=QUO_STK104) is worth $115/share. What happened?

There are many catalysts that seem to have happened at the same time to drop the price of the stock. Here are a few of the big ones that are often most discussed by journalists and bloggers.

As the thesis goes, when these catalysts have played themselves out and/or public opinion becomes disinterested, uncertainty is removed. When uncertainty is removed, VRX could have significant upward pressure.

**Reason 1: Pearson, Canny or Just Clueless?**

Valeant CEO J. Michael Pearson, as a result of his previous superstar performance, 2008-2014, was slow to fall out of favor with management. However, after [unplanned margin call stock sales to support his lifestyle](http://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2016/04/13/valeant-pharmaceuticals-prescription-for-disaster/#3cc89d226c65)), publicity about [donating to charities but never paying](http://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2016/04/13/valeant-pharmaceuticals-prescription-for-disaster/#3cc89d226c65)), and a [disastrous earnings and guidance call in March](http://www.fiercepharma.com/financials/activist-ackman-vows-to-intervene-after-disastrous-day-at-valeant), among other things, Pearson burned through investor patience quickly.

*Takeaway:* Any Valeant investor should know that the people who have invested previously are angry at the outgoing bad management for the volatility and will tend to be negative about management until less volatility in management and less volatility in results can be delivered.

We'll cover Pearson in a bit.

**Reason 2: Martin Shkreli Goes Viral**

Shkreli was an employee of television host [Jim Cramer's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Cramer) old firm [Cramer, Berkowitz, and Co.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Shkreli#Career) when he first caught the ire of the SEC for shorting biotech. He began a pharma portfolio company in 2011, [Retrophin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Shkreli#Retrophin), though was fired in 2014 and began the now-infamous Turing Pharmaceuticals.

In 2015, Shkreli went viral as the pharma exec who acquired and boosted the price of an HIV drug, Daraprim, by more than 5,556%. Going viral for raising the price of a drug launched him into the public eye and put him at the center of the American Healthcare Proxy Fight, described below, which then sucked in Valeant along with him.

Shkreli went from being unknown to being the [""most hated man in America""](http://qz.com/576554/martin-shkreli-the-ceo-who-jacked-up-prices-on-an-hiv-drug-was-arrested-this-morning/). In some ways, his own actions made this worse. When brought before a Congressional Hearing, Shkreli pleaded the fifth and tweeted that [politicians are imbeciles](http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/02/04/martin-shkreli-congressional-testimony-turing-pharmaceuticals-valeant-fda-drug-prices/79808004/).

The most remarkable thing about Shkreli, despite all of the bad press about him, is that he has a growing fan base. His self-produced YouTube channels [featuring him doing tutorials in finance](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8gjB1PSXv_oAUSAQ16S0fA/videos) have earned him praise. 

Shkreli has tweaked his media image, eventually coming to the conclusion that being transparent and accessible to the public through these tutorials could begin to change public opinion. His students may not all understand the business of pharma like he does, but they do get an understanding of the person behind the media. 

*Takeaway:* Any Valeant investor should pay attention to how quickly public opinion can change through transparency.

**Reason 3: Ongoing American Healthcare Proxy Fight**

The American healthcare system is arguably in need of a lot of help. The affordability of healthcare for aging Baby Boomers has been a critical issue for years. On the other end of the age spectrum, struggling younger people (Millennials, Generation X) want reform because their expenses are also very high. The game involves a lot of power changing hands between a lot of powerful people, so it is no surprise that, aside from [Obamacare](https://www.healthcare.gov/), little progress has been made in decades.

This battle has been raging for a half century, and is often used as a [proxy fight](
http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/8082-the-healthcare-battle-will-be-a-proxy-fight-of-divisions-in-american-politics) for stakeholders behind the scenes. Political parties, corporations, and everyone with a stake in how healthcare is regulated are all involved, and things get very dirty very quickly when public opinion is stoked.

A typical scenario is that politicians try to tackle the problem [through the use of public shame](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/02/04/pharma-bro-martin-shkreli-faces-congress-today-but-pledges-silence/) of CEOs or companies to influence public opinion, as a sort of substitute for actually working together and introducing legislation to fix the system. 

In contrast, Big Pharma fights back by influencing public opinion that government bureaucrats will only make things a lot worse and hinder improvements. One famous example was when then-First Lady Hillary Clinton [fought for healthcare reform in the 1990s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_health_care_plan_of_1993) and was subject to significant amounts of lambasting in the media by the pharma industry with [year-round television advertisements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_and_Louise).

The point being, while the amount of outrage present during election years is often higher than normal, this fight has been going on for a very long time and occasionally flares up.

*Takeaway:* Any Valeant investor should understand that anger at American pharma tends to be cyclical -- a proxy war between two powerful factions -- and the public loses interest quickly once actual details emerge.

**Reason 4: An American Presidential Election**

As a side note to American Healthcare, there is an American presidential election happening currently. Politicians have been using [populism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism), including outrage at established industries by candidates Trump and Sanders, as part of their platform.

Despite Hillary Clinton's favorable reception with Wall Street ([Wall Street believes she will be the next president](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/06/wall-st-is-pretty-certain-who-will-be-president.html)), Mrs. Clinton [singled out Valeant](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/fff89b8e-c922-11e5-be0b-b7ece4e953a0.html) because the price of the drug dihydroergotamine had risen 356%.

*Takeaway:* A Valeant investor should understand that the American presidential election will dominate the headlines until November 2016, and pharma is an easy target for politicians.

**Reason 5: 'Perfect Storm' of Balking**

When there is uncertainty in a company, the stock drops as investors balk and pull their money from the shares. As we continue on, it is worth noting that it doesn't matter what the actual story is:

- Anytime a company acquires significant debt, investors balk.
- Anytime accounting irregularities are even *mentioned*, investors balk. 
- Anytime an insider dumps a lot of shares, investors balk.
- Anytime management is suspected of having problems behind the scenes, investors balk. 
- Anytime management doesn't acknowledge something that appears real to the average investor, investors balk.

In the story of Valeant, there was a lot of balking going on in a very short amount of time, and that cumulative uncertainty dropped the stock.

*Takeaway:* A Valeant investor should understand that the nervousness and volatility around the company comes from balking so much in such a short amount of time.

####**Pearson Goes Off the Deep End**

Less than two years ago, Valeant's CEO, J. Michael Pearson, was an absolute superstar. Valeant had [returned in excess of 2,300%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Michael_Pearson#Career) since 2008. Yet, as the saying goes, a CEO is only as good as his or her last quarter. Pearson's downfall is often attributed to that superstar status becoming a little sloppy, a little arrogant, and a little distracted because of health issues. This led to a loss of control.

I've read a number of things condemning his lifestyle, his management, his compensation. A lot of it is overly negative and probably not true. We know he was absent for a while and hospitalized with pneumonia. We know he was in the wrong position at the wrong place during the wrong time when Martin Skreli was taunting the public. We know he likely approved using mail-order pharmacy Philidor to steer its customers toward more expensive, Valeant-made drugs. It could be anything or everything that made investor sentiment turn against him.

**The Superstar Gets Sloppy**

What's clear is Pearson was off his game. He started to buy things he couldn't afford. He would make donations to nonprofit foundations he couldn't actually pay for. He bought hi-rise real estate in Miami with money he didn't have. He would try to do things publicly to ""juice"" Valeant shares to try to get more money.

One lifestyle issue that ended up dropping the stock was when Pearson was borrowing money (""buying on margin"") and buying Valeant stock circa October, 2015. As anyone who has ever done this knows, this goes well until the stock sinks. When the stock drops beyond a certain point, the broker will perform a ""margin call"" and the investor must pay cash.

Goldman Sachs issued a margin call on his stock holdings in October, 2015. Pearson couldn't pay. When the client cannot pay, the broker sells stock to pay. However, as the CEO of a public company, this selloff would be broadcast for everyone to see.

Unable to pay the margin call, to take payment [Goldman Sachs forcibly liquidated 1.3 million of his shares](http://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2016/04/13/valeant-pharmaceuticals-prescription-for-disaster/#3cc89d226c65). In the insider activity log, in fact, you can see where all this happened. [Pearson's shares were sold and things got real really quick](
http://insiders.morningstar.com/trading/insider-activity.action?t=VRX&amp;region=usa&amp;culture=en-US).

For a public company to have the CEO randomly selloff over a million shares, there's going to be repercussions and a shock to the system. Investors balk, asking, ""What's wrong?""

####**The CFO and Philidor**

A significant item of uncertainty swirls around the use of a mail-order pharmacy to fill prescriptions, [Philidor](http://www.philidorrxservices.com/). That relationship apparently made things complicated enough that Valeant's Annual Reports were delayed. As far as I can figure out, CFO Howard Schiller and possibly Pearson allowed Valeant to partner with Philidor for some prescriptions. It was Schiller, however, who ultimately took the heat for it and was fired.

The whole thing seems to have started out as an experiment where Valeant lent employees to Philidor for support. Eventually, things became too close, and Philidor started steering its customers away from cheaper generics and toward the more expensive Valeant brands.

It is worth noting that in some countries, particularly ones where the quality of generics is not trusted, this practice is acceptable. However, in American culture, this constitutes a conflict of interest in the public eye. Pharmacies should remain neutral.

**Philidor Dumped, Walgreen's Brought In**

This relationship was dropped in October last year after Martin Shkreli's story went viral and Valeant was launched into the public eye. A more proper (and palatable) relationship with a more traditional drug retailer, Walgreen's (Walgreens Boots Alliance ($WBA)), was formed.

Valeant threw Schiller under the bus publicly for the whole thing. Less so for the actual concept and more so because some of Valeant's deals had started to involve Schiller making decisions that were outside the realm of what he should have been making. Valeant says, generically, that he was fired for ""inappropriate conduct"". The CFO may have [had a conflict of interest](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-21/valeant-s-schiller-says-company-incorrect-about-conduct), but Schiller strongly denies any wrongdoing.

During the most recent earnings call, Pearson said that it is more important to move forward, noting that [""well over 90% of our doctors who [were] using Philidor are now using Walgreen's""](http://www.nasdaq.com/aspx/call-transcript.aspx?StoryId=3958769&amp;Title=valeant-pharmaceuticals-vrx-ceo-michael-pearson-on-q4-2015-results-earnings-call-transcript).

####**Firing the Superstar**

On March 21, 2016, the Board announced the final decision that Pearson, regardless of his legendary status in making the company what it had become, would be fired.

At this point, Pearson overplayed his hand, creating more volatility for the stock and uncertainty: [he wouldn't leave](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-22/with-board-member-who-won-t-leave-valeant-is-at-mercy-of-bylaws). When that news was released, blogs were posting that the company was at the mercy of a rogue, out-of-control CEO.

It ultimately backfired for Pearson, because not only did he eventually lose his job, [he has been called to do a Congressional Hearing about raising the prices of pharmaceuticals](http://fortune.com/2016/03/28/valeants-ceo-testify-u-s-congressional-hearing/).

Thus, the Board (and by extension, the investors) eventually won. Pearson acquiesced and agreed to leave after a new CEO could be found.

Legendary hedge fund manager and shareholder activist Bill Ackman [took the CFO Schiller's place on the Board](http://www.valeant.com/about/board-of-directors), where he is today, becoming an active investor instead of a purely passive investor. Ackman will be discussed in the next installment.

*Takeaway:* Investors are betting that if the company can function reasonably with such volatile management, what it can do with good or even great management could be impressive.

####**Tomorrow: The Turnaround**
There has been a lot of discussion around legendary hedge fund manager Bill Ackman and how he bet a billion dollars on Valeant, rode it to the bottom, and will now turn it around. We will cover who he is, where he's going, and why this may be his best performance yet.

### Introduction (again)

This is a primer about Valeant ($VRX). It will expire and become obsolete upon the release of updated Valeant financial statements, which could happen any day, though is supposed to happen before the 29th of April. *Right now, this is a guide into possibly taking advantage of the uncertainty around Valeant, which has depressed the stock.*

Valeant ($VRX) is probably the only time that I have seen [/r/investing](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing), [/r/wallstreetbets](http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets), and buy side research like [Morningstar](http://www.morningstar.com/) actually agree with one another. Morningstar [rates it as 5 stars](http://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/vrx/quote.html) as of this release date (April 19, 2016). This is so infrequent that it is like having an alignment of the planets.

When I see overlapping worlds get excited, I immediately want to know the story. Over a weekend, I began pulling together all of the different sources and piecing together as much as I could in a limited amount of time.

It is not intended as a replacement for commentary by a CFA (which can be found [here](http://analysisreport.morningstar.com/stock/research?t=VRX&amp;region=usa&amp;culture=en-US&amp;HID=QUO_STK118), (subscription required)), rather, it is a quick and dirty attempt to explain, in ordinary language, what the company does, how it makes money, who are the players involved, and what are some catalysts for its past fall and its future rise.

If you want to dig deeper and do more homework, this will kick it off. Use my work in addition to your own work or methods, and let's make some money. We are *all* trying to figure this one out before things are released, and where there's uncertainty, there's always opportunity.

### Thesis
My position is to buy before the catalysts. Once catalysts [mentioned here in Part 1: The Basics](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/4fbqyd/part_1_valeant_vrx_due_diligence_and_analysis/) start to happen, uncertainty will be removed. When uncertainty is removed through management changes, realignments of strategy, asset sales, cost cutting, etc., a depressed stock can have significant upward pressure.

###*2015-2016: Lots of Investors Balking in Little Time*

####**Five Big Catalysts for the Stock's Plunge**

Between 2015-2016, the stock plunged from $262/share (August 2015) to $33/share, where it is today (April 2016). That's an almost 90% loss. Morningstar's analyst, Michael Waterhouse, says [the stock's fair market value](http://analysisreport.morningstar.com/stock/research?t=VRX&amp;culture=en-US&amp;region=usa&amp;HID=QUO_STK104) is worth $115/share. What happened?

There are many catalysts that seem to have happened at the same time to drop the price of the stock. Here are a few of the big ones that are often most discussed by journalists and bloggers.

As the thesis goes, when these catalysts have played themselves out and/or public opinion becomes disinterested, uncertainty is removed. When uncertainty is removed, VRX could have significant upward pressure.

**Reason 1: Pearson, Canny or Just Clueless?**

Valeant CEO J. Michael Pearson, as a result of his previous superstar performance, 2008-2014, was slow to fall out of favor with management. However, after [unplanned margin call stock sales to support his lifestyle](http://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2016/04/13/valeant-pharmaceuticals-prescription-for-disaster/#3cc89d226c65)), publicity about [donating to charities but never paying](http://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2016/04/13/valeant-pharmaceuticals-prescription-for-disaster/#3cc89d226c65)), and a [disastrous earnings and guidance call in March](http://www.fiercepharma.com/financials/activist-ackman-vows-to-intervene-after-disastrous-day-at-valeant), among other things, Pearson burned through investor patience quickly.

*Takeaway:* Any Valeant investor should know that the people who have invested previously are angry at the outgoing bad management for the volatility and will tend to be negative about management until less volatility in management and less volatility in results can be delivered.

We'll cover Pearson in a bit.

**Reason 2: Martin Shkreli Goes Viral**

Shkreli was an employee of television host [Jim Cramer's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Cramer) old firm [Cramer, Berkowitz, and Co.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Shkreli#Career) when he first caught the ire of the SEC for shorting biotech. He began a pharma portfolio company in 2011, [Retrophin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Shkreli#Retrophin), though was fired in 2014 and began the now-infamous Turing Pharmaceuticals.

In 2015, Shkreli went viral as the pharma exec who acquired and boosted the price of an HIV drug, Daraprim, by more than 5,556%. Going viral for raising the price of a drug launched him into the public eye and put him at the center of the American Healthcare Proxy Fight, described below, which then sucked in Valeant along with him.

Shkreli went from being unknown to being the [""most hated man in America""](http://qz.com/576554/martin-shkreli-the-ceo-who-jacked-up-prices-on-an-hiv-drug-was-arrested-this-morning/). In some ways, his own actions made this worse. When brought before a Congressional Hearing, Shkreli pleaded the fifth and tweeted that [politicians are imbeciles](http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/02/04/martin-shkreli-congressional-testimony-turing-pharmaceuticals-valeant-fda-drug-prices/79808004/).

The most remarkable thing about Shkreli, despite all of the bad press about him, is that he has a growing fan base. His self-produced YouTube channels [featuring him doing tutorials in finance](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8gjB1PSXv_oAUSAQ16S0fA/videos) have earned him praise. 

Shkreli has tweaked his media image, eventually coming to the conclusion that being transparent and accessible to the public through these tutorials could begin to change public opinion. His students may not all understand the business of pharma like he does, but they do get an understanding of the person behind the media. 

*Takeaway:* Any Valeant investor should pay attention to how quickly public opinion can change through transparency.

**Reason 3: Ongoing American Healthcare Proxy Fight**

Political parties, corporations, and everyone with a stake in how healthcare is regulated are all involved, and things get very dirty very quickly when public opinion is stoked.

A typical scenario is that politicians try to tackle the problem [through the use of public shame](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/02/04/pharma-bro-martin-shkreli-faces-congress-today-but-pledges-silence/) of CEOs or companies to influence public opinion, as a sort of substitute for actually working together and introducing legislation to fix the system. 

In contrast, Big Pharma fights back by influencing public opinion that government bureaucrats will only make things a lot worse and hinder improvements.

- Anytime an insider dumps a lot of shares, investors balk.

- Anytime management doesn't acknowledge something that appears real to the average investor, investors balk.

In the story of Valeant, there was a lot of balking going on in a very short amount of time, and that cumulative uncertainty dropped the stock.

*Takeaway:* A Valeant investor should understand that the nervousness and volatility around the company comes from balking so much in such a short amount of time.

####**The CFO and Philidor**

####**Firing the Superstar**

At this point, Pearson overplayed his hand, creating more volatility for the stock and uncertainty: [he wouldn't leave](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-22/with-board-member-who-won-t-leave-valeant-is-at-mercy-of-bylaws).

It looks as though the [space is being filled with quite a few private companies, and several listed on the TSX as well](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/marihuana/info/list-eng.php). Two I think people generally know about are:

[Mettrum Health Corp.](https://www.google.ca/finance?q=CVE%3AMT&amp;ei=4D0WV9HfD4Se2AbWvIy4AQ)

As for the rest of you fellow savvy Canadian investors who may or not have heard, Bankers Petroleum (BNK), has been offered by a Chinese firm named Geo-Jade Petroleum for an all cash stock buyout at a price of 2.20$ per share, if you were also savvy enough you may have also noticed that the **shares are trading at a discount of 1.81$ per share.**
Basically, there is a 22-18% upside on the table depending where you get filled at (1.80-1.86 has been the recent range for the past few weeks).

Ok here's the scenario:

* Vote requires 2/3 shareholders to vote yes. Management owns ~7% of the shares. Ballots are being mailed soon I believe.
* BNK is worth more than 2.20$ a share based on book value as well as their reserves alone. 
* [BNK also has pretty solid financials](https://www.google.com/finance?q=TSE%3ABNK&amp;fstype=ii&amp;ei=bdMWV5jvAsK72AbK8IPgDQ) considering the past 18 months of oil shitiness.
* BNK's directors and insiders have been buying shares since the deal has been announced, they have a lot of confidence in the deal and have been buying shares on the public exchanges since. Almost about half a million dollars worth between a few of the executives. (I'd attach a link but I can only get the information from my Webbroker account)
* Deal in essence is a very good price for the Chinese company. They have been working on this plan with BNK for about a year or so. There is also a 20 million dollar fine if they bail out of it.
* Deal allows for a counter offer but I'm doubtful of this factor coming into play. 

Risks:

* [Tax dispute issue](http://www.bankerspetroleum.com/investing/news-releases/bankers-petroleum-and-government-albania-sign-agreement-binding-third-party) that was relevant a few months ago, goes in favour of the government and Bankers gets fucked because of it. Unlikely due to the government being full of crazy corrupt Albanians. Unlikely to have any effect except for a dip to buy more, but really unlikely to fuck up the deal considering the Chinese had this knowledge prior to the deal.
* The deal doesn't go through and shares drop like crazy. It is a possibility, but I think the Chinese went through with this deal solely because of value they are getting for the price. 
*Oil collapses and then the Chinese pulls out.
*Greedy investors think 2.20 isn't enough and vote NO, doubtful considering the current oil environment and the 98% premium from the closing price before the deal was announced.

Overall, this isn't the MOST exciting play for 20% upside and  the potential risk of it falling apart. However if you're willing to throw 5k at, that's a free 1k for just waiting about a month or two.

Oh, and you can join in too if you're American, but good luck getting shares for $BNKJF on OTC with solid liquidity (30k is average).

*DD: I am long at AVG price of 1.71$ for ~4300 shares*",4

### Introduction (again)

This is a primer about Valeant ($VRX). It will expire and become obsolete upon the release of updated Valeant financial statements, which could happen any day, though is supposed to happen before the 29th of April. *Right now, this is a guide into possibly taking advantage of the uncertainty around Valeant, which has depressed the stock.*

Valeant ($VRX) is probably the only time that I have seen [/r/investing](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing), [/r/wallstreetbets](http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets), and buy side research like [Morningstar](http://www.morningstar.com/) actually agree with one another. Morningstar [rates it as 5 stars](http://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/vrx/quote.html) as of this release date (April 20, 2016). This is so infrequent that it is like having an alignment of the planets.

When I see overlapping worlds get excited, I immediately want to know the story. Over a weekend, I began pulling together all of the different sources and piecing together as much as I could in a limited amount of time.

It is not intended as a replacement for commentary by a CFA (which can be found [here](http://analysisreport.morningstar.com/stock/research?t=VRX&amp;region=usa&amp;culture=en-US&amp;HID=QUO_STK118), (subscription required)), rather, it is a quick and dirty attempt to explain, in ordinary language, what the company does, how it makes money, who are the players involved, and what are some catalysts for its past fall and its future rise.

If you want to dig deeper and do more homework, this will kick it off. Use my work in addition to your own work or methods, and let's make some money. We are *all* trying to figure this one out before things are released, and where there's uncertainty, there's always opportunity.

### Thesis
My position is to buy before the catalysts. Once catalysts [mentioned here in Part 1: The Basics](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/4fbqyd/part_1_valeant_vrx_due_diligence_and_analysis/) start to happen, uncertainty will be removed. When uncertainty is removed through management changes, realignments of strategy, asset sales, cost cutting, etc., a depressed stock can have significant upward pressure.

###*All Eyes on Ackman*

###**Who is Bill Ackman?**

For this final installment, let's talk about legendary hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, since he will have a big say over whether an investment in Valeant is positive or negative moving forward.

Ackman had his worst performance ever last year (2015) at Pershing Square Holdings, his hedge fund, as a result of CEO Pearson and CFO Schiller becoming sloppy at Valeant. Ackman believes in the core business of the company, describing it as the Berkshire Hathaway of pharma.

He says he invested in the company at a marginal discount. He bet over a billion dollars of investors' money on the company. This was [long before Goldman Sachs' margin call on Pearson](http://www.dataroma.com/m/hist/hist.php?f=psc&amp;s=VRX) set off a chain of events that led to the depression of the stock by 50% in a single month.

His role was as a passive investor, which means he had no control over its governance. 

Ackman remained by the investment from its peak until where it is now. While investing message boards chided him for riding Valeant all the way down to its present state, [in his latest earnings letter to Pershing Square investors](http://assets.pershingsquareholdings.com/2014/09/Pershing-Square-2015-Annual-Letter-PSH-January-26-2016.pdf), we learn that he was actually restricted from trading and taking profits:

&gt; Our failure to sell stock wasn’t entirely an unforced error as we found 
&gt; ourselves largely restricted from trading during this period. During the
&gt; summer, we were made aware of a large potential transaction that Valeant 
&gt; was working on, and as a result, we were restricted from trading at a time
&gt; when it would have been prudent to take some money off the table.

[He was able to reduce his position](http://www.dataroma.com/m/hist/hist.php?f=psc&amp;s=VRX) in the 4th quarter, 2015, but it was too late. 

As mentioned last time, as of March 21st, 2016, with the firing of Pearson and Schiller, Bill Ackman is no longer passive. He is now an active (**activist**) investor who now sits on the Board of Directors at Valeant. He now has power and he intends to use it for the benefit of investors, intending [rapid recovery for Valeant](http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/04/06/2016/ackman-predicts-rapid-recovery-valeant-wall-streets-not-so-bullish). 

From the [article](http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/04/06/2016/ackman-predicts-rapid-recovery-valeant-wall-streets-not-so-bullish):

&gt; ""We expect fairly rapid recovery of the stock price on the basis of restoring 
&gt; confidence in the business,"" Ackman said, noting ""very interesting and good
&gt; segments for a CEO to step in.""

This isn't Ackman's first recovery job. Some of his work has included cleaning up these kinds of companies before -- companies having problems internally. One such company, [Canadian Pacific ($CP)](http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE%3ACP), is an old railroad founded in the 19th century which was unprofitable and uncompetitive. By reworking a lot of the internal problems, he made it into a profitable and competitive enterprise -- and continues to do so.

Ackman is known for his activism, and he seems to be a cut above the average hedge fund manager:

* He signed the [Giving Pledge](http://givingpledge.org/), along with Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, to give millions, possibly billions, to philanthropic charities upon his death. 

* He is known for [going after Herbalife by shorting them](http://fortune.com/2016/02/09/bill-ackman-herbalife/), which he says he will hold forever if he needs to. Herbalife has been accused of running a pyramid scheme which takes advantage of the poor. In fact, Ackman is now in a movie called [Betting on Zero](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-14/ackman-herbalife-feud-gets-fresh-scrutiny-at-tribeca-film-fest) at Tribeca which documents the problems with Herbalife.

One thing he has done that I think shows quite a bit of class is to take the time out to make a beginner's video for people who are new to finance and investing:

* [Bill Ackman -- Everything You Need To Know About Finance In An Hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEDIj9JBTC8)

He also talks about some of his investing philosophies:

* [Bill Ackman -- Rules of Investing like a Maverick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze6dgTq7nn8)

####**Moving Forward: Going In With the Big Names**

Whenever I do speculation, I personally want to make sure there are quality people going in with me who have skin in the game and would be burned a lot worse than I would. I want to see high profile people going in with me.

Here's the deal, as I see it. 

If I'm wrong in my thesis, then I'm wrong. But it's not me that's wrong. There are a lot of people who would be wrong, too:

* Ackman's reputation will be destroyed and he'll be tarnished for life for losing over a billion dollars of hedge fund money.
* Paulson, Ubben, and Cuniff (Sequoia), all prominent investors in Valeant, will probably suffer similar fates 
* Morningstar and their analysts are wrong
* Wall Street consensus analysts are wrong
* Mutual fund companies like T. Rowe Price have it in their mutual funds, and they'd be wrong 
* Other hedge funds investing in Valeant and watching Bill Ackman's moves - they would be wrong, too
* Wealthy investors will lose a lot of money, and heads will roll

If the whole ecosystem is totally wrong, then we're all wrong and we're going to all go down together. As smaller investors, we'll lose money, but not like those guys. There is a lot at stake, and [sticking by Valeant](http://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2016/03/14/the-investor-who-keeps-sticking-by-valeant-pharmaceuticals-longer-than-anyone-else/#73499c0760ef) is not as uncommon as it might seem.

But, if the ecosystem is right, even a little right, then we could see very good results and a lot of upside.

####**Answers to Tough Questions**

**Bullshit Forum Myth #1: They're Going Out of Business.**

The company makes money. Period. Full stop. End of story. It's hard to go out of business if you're making money. Now, whether it is growing fast enough for investors' tastes is one thing. Whether it has a pipeline that lasts forever if no other companies are acquired is another thing. Whether they sell off the right assets, develop a great strategy for debt, cut costs, and maximize cash flow is still yet another thing. However, the company makes money. It's not going out of business anytime soon.

The actual accounting issue, from what can be determined, seems to be confined to a misstatement of the $58M relationship with Philidor. They have [had a 3rd party auditor confirm that it was fixed and there were no other problems](http://www.wsj.com/articles/valeant-finishes-accounting-and-philidor-review-with-no-more-problems-1459862081). We have no reason to believe that they're wrong at this time.

The key issue is that they didn’t release their reports on time. To me, this is sloppy, there's a lack of focus, and it's fault of previous management. However, it is a lot better than getting things out on time and brazenly lying or doing something that would be a clear signal of bad faith. 

There is also an admission of things, to get everything out there and over with. This is a promising start.

**Bullshit Forum Myth #2: Comparisons to Enron**

Comparisons to Enron are ignorant, frankly. Enron shredded documents, had no real business, and executives lied under oath. There were coverups. There were no voluntary admissions of anything. Retirements were blown to bits by investing deeply in company stock. Chairman Lay and CEO Skilling were convicted. Lay died before going to prison. If this even remotely resembled Enron, I wouldn't be writing this and you wouldn't be reading this.

**Bullshit Forum Myth #3: It's heavily shorted!**

[This is incorrect.](http://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/vrx/quote.html). Shorted shares as a percentage of the float are only about 4% of the float.

As a point of reference, a company like Netflix is 6%, whereas a company like Mattress Firm or Tesla hovers around 30-40%.

####**Conclusion**

Lastly, in his January 26th letter, Ackman says this, which I think will be relevant to anyone who is considering investing:

&gt; I have often stated that in order to be a great investor one needs
&gt; to first have the confidence to invest without perfect information
&gt; at a time when others are highly skeptical about the opportunity 
&gt; you are pursuing. 

My own opinion is that I anticipate we will have some sparks fly in the near term as Pearson heads to Congress on the 27th and accounting is turned in near the 29th. We will have several volatile quarters until more uncertainty is removed with capable, competent management running the show.

The point is this. Do your own due diligence before you invest your own money, but move forward knowing that nobody can have all the answers on this one, and that's where the opportunity lies. If everyone had all of the answers, there would be no inefficiencies. Instead, we can make an educated guess and take an educated risk.",32

### Introduction (again)

This is a primer about Valeant ($VRX). It will expire and become obsolete upon the release of updated Valeant financial statements, which could happen any day, though is supposed to happen before the 29th of April. *Right now, this is a guide into possibly taking advantage of the uncertainty around Valeant, which has depressed the stock.*

Valeant ($VRX) is probably the only time that I have seen [/r/investing](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing), [/r/wallstreetbets](http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets), and buy side research like [Morningstar](http://www.morningstar.com/) actually agree with one another. Morningstar [rates it as 5 stars](http://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/vrx/quote.html) as of this release date (April 20, 2016). This is so infrequent that it is like having an alignment of the planets.

When I see overlapping worlds get excited, I immediately want to know the story. Over a weekend, I began pulling together all of the different sources and piecing together as much as I could in a limited amount of time.

It is not intended as a replacement for commentary by a CFA (which can be found [here](http://analysisreport.morningstar.com/stock/research?t=VRX&amp;region=usa&amp;culture=en-US&amp;HID=QUO_STK118), (subscription required)), rather, it is a quick and dirty attempt to explain, in ordinary language, what the company does, how it makes money, who are the players involved, and what are some catalysts for its past fall and its future rise.

If you want to dig deeper and do more homework, this will kick it off. Use my work in addition to your own work or methods, and let's make some money. We are *all* trying to figure this one out before things are released, and where there's uncertainty, there's always opportunity.

### Thesis
My position is to buy before the catalysts. Once catalysts [mentioned here in Part 1: The Basics](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/4fbqyd/part_1_valeant_vrx_due_diligence_and_analysis/) start to happen, uncertainty will be removed. When uncertainty is removed through management changes, realignments of strategy, asset sales, cost cutting, etc., a depressed stock can have significant upward pressure.

###*All Eyes on Ackman*

###**Who is Bill Ackman?**

For this final installment, let's talk about legendary hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, since he will have a big say over whether an investment in Valeant is positive or negative moving forward.

Ackman had his worst performance ever last year (2015) at Pershing Square Holdings, his hedge fund, as a result of CEO Pearson and CFO Schiller becoming sloppy at Valeant. Ackman believes in the core business of the company, describing it as the Berkshire Hathaway of pharma.

He says he invested in the company at a marginal discount. He bet over a billion dollars of investors' money on the company. This was [long before Goldman Sachs' margin call on Pearson](http://www.dataroma.com/m/hist/hist.php?f=psc&amp;s=VRX) set off a chain of events that led to the depression of the stock by 50% in a single month.

His role was as a passive investor, which means he had no control over its governance. 

Ackman remained by the investment from its peak until where it is now. While investing message boards chided him for riding Valeant all the way down to its present state, [in his latest earnings letter to Pershing Square investors](http://assets.pershingsquareholdings.com/2014/09/Pershing-Square-2015-Annual-Letter-PSH-January-26-2016.pdf), we learn that he was actually restricted from trading and taking profits:

&gt; Our failure to sell stock wasn’t entirely an unforced error as we found 
&gt; ourselves largely restricted from trading during this period. During the
&gt; summer, we were made aware of a large potential transaction that Valeant 
&gt; was working on, and as a result, we were restricted from trading at a time
&gt; when it would have been prudent to take some money off the table.

[He was able to reduce his position](http://www.dataroma.com/m/hist/hist.php?f=psc&amp;s=VRX) in the 4th quarter, 2015, but it was too late. 

As mentioned last time, as of March 21st, 2016, with the firing of Pearson and Schiller, Bill Ackman is no longer passive. He is now an active (**activist**) investor who now sits on the Board of Directors at Valeant. He now has power and he intends to use it for the benefit of investors, intending [rapid recovery for Valeant](http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/04/06/2016/ackman-predicts-rapid-recovery-valeant-wall-streets-not-so-bullish).

&gt; confidence in the business,"" Ackman said, noting ""very interesting and good

16-04-19,4fi6kk,"What are your favorite points from ""The Intelligent Investor"" ? These are mine!","Point #1 Invest, never Speculate.

Understand the difference between speculation and investment. It’s the difference between blindly gambling at a casino after drinking too much, and counting the cards like rainman.
With Investment your research proves that your investment will not only maintain its value but will produce adequate return.

Example: You have done your research on Intel corporation, their financial statement consistently proves to have assets well above liabilities. The company is trading at a low P/E, and the dividends are reliable.

Speculation is Anything other than informed, researched investment. Often emotionally driven, hunch driven, or popular opinion driven.

Example: You over hear your friends drunk wealthy dad at a barbecue talk about how great of a company Enron is, and that he’s making a ton of money off their stocks, therefore you should invest.

Point #2 Are you an Aggressive or Defensive Investor?

Figuring out whether you classify as an aggressive or defensive investor will completely guide your portfolio and investing strategy. Decide which best fits you.

A Defensive Investor Puts money into the stock market on a routine schedule, possibly from a savings account. They also invest into funds or indexes, never independent companies. 

This requires little involvement and is low risk. This path doesn’t take a ton of effort, and won’t give you night sweats.

Just don’t expect 1200% return.

Example Strategy: Every time you save $1,000.00 you make an investment. You maintain a 50% split between a bond index and common stock index.

If you have $1000.00 to invest, you can put $500.00 into Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (VTI) and $500.00 into Vanguard Intermediate Term Bond Index fund (BIV).

Every few months you routinely make an investment that keeps your portfolio balanced.

For instance if your portfolio has grown to $600.00 in bonds and $800.00 in stocks you would invest $400.00 into the bonds, and $200.00 into stocks to maintain the fifty-fifty split.

On the other hand, an Aggressive Investor seeks higher than average returns, takes higher than average risks, and is actively involved with their investments.

This path is gut wrenching and time intensive, but tends to pay more when done correctly. This route was too stressful, and non-rewarding for me. However, If you like a challenge give it a try.

Example Strategy: You maintain a minimum of 25% bonds and 75% hand picked diversified stock investments.

If you have $1000.00 you can put 25% into Vanguard Intermediate Term Bond Index fund (BIV) and 75% into a diversified portfolio of researched stocks of your choosing!

For more information on how to stay diversified head over to investopedia.com.

Aim to buy stocks when they are undervalued.

Stocks that have low P/E ratio, report consistent growth, and have positive asset to liability ratio are attractive.",2

Given I currently have 200k equity in my account thanks to this ongoing oil yolo, I am thinking about the next yolo. Tomorrow morning Im closely going to watch the ASX for the first few hours. Ill get about 3 hours of observation in to pick up market direction for my yolo to end all yolos and retire on hookers and ludes.

Thoughts on this idea. 

I can get 294x leverage on Index and Im currently eying off the Hong Kong 45 (HSI). Hopefully oil breaks this 42 and markets will be getting confident as fuck. The HSI will soar, and Ill dump 250k on 294x leverage on the HSI at open. This will be about 74 million margined to the balls. If the ASX opens strong (given the current market its looking likely) Ill place an order for open.

16-04-20,4fla7i,"What's the options play if I believe a stock is going to be lower 20~60 days from now?","I don't want to go short on the stock.

Edit. Some rationale for this:

PBR (actually PETR3), as with most oil stocks, [ is highly correlated with oil](http://imgur.com/n1X1Sol). It has rallied recently not only because of the oil recovery, but also because of the political turmoil over the possibility of Roussef's impeachment, causing a massive market rally, even in stocks unrelated to oil. 

Now, more than ever, the Roussef's impeachment is priced in, or so I believe. The rally was too strong and I expect a correction. If the impeachment comes to reality, the market will melt down because no actual structural changes are taking place, not yet. As I said, the expectations over the impeachment itself are already priced in. There's nobody left to buy. If the impeachment doesn't go through, I don't see a direction to the market other than down, unless oil keeps going up and strongly. 

Speaking of which, my bets on oil are on a short lived rally, only to visit the 30s again, soon, since no fundamental changes on oil output and consumption favoring an uptrend are on the short term horizon.

Some of you might have read my last gold DD that called todays price increase, well i have more news.

Gold is on the rise right now and at this time im planning on loading up more $NUGT tomorrow when it dips, that could change by morning. (right now it looks like it might be turning to $DUST)

The point of this DD is to inform WSB'ers about the upcoming $NUGT rally (whether its a continuation of todays rally im unsure)

$NUGT is a 3x ETF based off of the [$GDX gold miner's index.](https://finance.yahoo.com/q/hl?s=GDX+Holdings)

For the next three weeks all companies involved in $GDX will be reporting their earnings.

Dates:

$NEM April 20th

$ABX April 26th

$NCMGF April 26th

$GG April 27th

$AEM April 28th

$FNV May 4th

$GOLD May 4th

$AU May 9th

$SLW May 9th

$KGC May 10th

I have not analyzed the financials for these companies but Im going to bet that with gold doing well $GDX will have a  better than normal average.

Also, the fed meeting is April 26th/27th and I doubt they will increase rates unless they want to stir more shit up.

$NUGT should do better than normal. 

Im staying all in until I see a reason to bail. #YOLO

[Targa Resources Corporation \(TRGP\)](http://www.targaresources.com/) is a mid-cap diversified Natural Gas company that has seen some hard times in the equity market.  It fell from a peak of around [$142 / share in 2014 to \(at the time of this post\) about $39 / share](https://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=maximized&amp;chdeh=0&amp;chfdeh=0&amp;chdet=1461182400000&amp;chddm=501262&amp;chls=IntervalBasedLine&amp;q=NYSE:TRGP&amp;ntsp=1&amp;ei=ZLEXV6GqJsK72AbK8IPgDQ).  [On the other hand, the share price has been gradually increasing since the February stock market dip to 2011 levels](http://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TRGP&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d).  As of the time of this writing, [Targa currently has a consensus Hold rating](http://www.thevistavoice.org/2016/04/20/targa-resources-corp-trgp-given-buy-rating-at-citigroup-inc/1079145/), with 11 firms rating hold and 5 rating buy.  During the past week alone the stock price has increased $6 / share and has had a bullish streak from April 15, 2016.

Additionally, the dividends have remained consistent (and have been increasing from 29 cents / share /quarter in 2011 to 91 cents / share / quarter in 2016) throughout this timespan.  It may be possible this could indicate a dividend trap, as Targa could take the entirely reasonable route and cut dividends and use that to pay off some debt (see below).  In 2015 they paid $0.152 billion to common stock shareholders.

TRGP's most recent 10k filing (February 2016) is located here: [http://ir.targaresources.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1140361-16-55576&amp;CIK=1379661](http://ir.targaresources.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1140361-16-55576&amp;CIK=1379661)

Targa has acquired several Natural Gas Pipeline operations in the midwest (the latest being Atlas Energy LP in 2015) and expansion into other service related sectors (shale natural gas, fractionation, refinery services, natural gas storage) in the Natural Gas industry.  These sectors can help alleviate the seasonal demand of electricity demand as plants go offline and require maintenance.  That being said, there are still multiple risks in the Natural Gas sector, including commodity pricing and demand/supply factors that may play a heavy role.  The company has been increasing its natural gas production, sales, and crude oil inventory over the past five years.  Perhaps to balance their increased operations growth, their cash flow expenditures have also increased over the past five years (which would explain the growth pattern in addition to their increased capital expenditures).

Targa does have a bit of debt, which poses a risk in the long term.  Approximately $4.8 billion in outstanding debt which may be difficult to pay off if the natural gas industry continues its several year decline.  To offset this, their five year average annual revenue is about $6.820 billion / year so the company doesn't seem to be at risk of bankruptcy in the near future.  The company has $0.154 billion cash on hand and has a total available liquidity of around $1.36 billion.

Finally, TRGP is not widely followed on financial social media sites.  [Stocktwits only has 227 watchers](http://stocktwits.com/symbol/TRGP) without a lot of post volume.  As a result I get the impression that this stock subsequently flies under the radar of many investors (hence the DD of this post to help fellow Redditors at identifying potential stock candidates).

A group of institutional investors worth $1 billion has joined forces to fight against the overuse of antibiotics in livestock for meat and poultry.

Jeremy Coller, founder of private equity secondaries house Coller Capital, and his Farm Animal Investment Risk &amp; Return (FAIRR) initiative have led the group, which is lobbying 10 publicly-traded companies to make changes to their meat and poultry supply chains.

The group of 54 investors, which includes Aviva Investors, Natixis Asset Management, ACTIAM, Mirova, Coller Capital and Strathclyde Pension Fund, has written to the companies and asked them to set appropriate timelines to prohibit the use of all medically important antibiotics in their global meat and poultry supply chains.

These companies are: Brinker International Restaurants; Darden Restaurants; Domino’s Pizza Group; J. D. Wetherspoon; McDonald’s Corporation; Mitchells &amp; Butlers; Restaurant Brands International; The Restaurant Group; The Wendy’s Company; and Yum! Brands.

As long as Shire remains above $148 on the purchase day you'll make easy money on this, assuming you buy Baxalta at $40.  Shares should be changing hands sometime in June.

16-04-20,4fp8ok,I need a list of all contingent convertible bonds. Anyone willing to help me out?,"Over the past 6-7 years, European banks have increasingly relied on contingent convertible bonds to meet their capital requirements under Basel III. There should be in the region of ~100 issuances of these type of bonds - and I am looking for them (e.g. list of ISINs).

**Some background**

I'll be using these for my Master thesis.  There are [quite some issuers](http://i.imgur.com/vJ4OBg8.png), and there does not seem to be a -*publicly available*- source with conclusive and reliable data on them.

The goal of my research is to draft a framework for (EU) investor protection in relation to these securities. Since contingent convertibles are not standardized I seek to draw rough lines on what the main design of the contingent convertibles currently issues is - where the emphasis lies on the *contingent* part of the bonds.  

This is [the framework](http://i.imgur.com/aUFS1YU.png) within which I will look at the prevailing risks of these bonds. What I aim to do is classify the current issuances within this framework, to get a better understanding of what the current market looks like. This, eventually, should form the basis to establish a framework for investor protection within the EU in relation to these bonds - but I won't bore you with that part. 

**What I am looking for**

List of ISINs would be great, and a list of ISINs (or other identifier) with the main characteristics (i.e. type of trigger; type of loss absorption mechanism) would be fantastic. 

If none of this is possible, leads to where I could get such information would be great too.

I managed to buy TSE:SVM at its +9% peak today. (TSE is the Toronto stock exchange, for all you amerifags who don't believe that canadians have the nous to actually have their own stock market, eh)  
  
I guess someone dumped a literal shit-tonne of precious metals within an hour of my idiot purchase because the fuckers are all down below their open. I mean literally every small silver miner is 10% below peak.  
  
Every cloud has a *silver* lining though lol, this would be a pretty good time to buy cheap silver exposure if you want to lose some money like I did.    

Why silver is good:  
1. Has been trading way too cheap compared to gold, so price should rise faster than gold sometime soon.  
2. Chinese and Indian people buy precious metals like basic bitches buy starbucks  
3. Now that some wankers aren't fixing the silver spot price, the price should rise more freely  
  
All of the above DD I heard on WSB and 0hedj so kindly GFYS.  
  
I will be buying back in tomorrow when the markets reopen because I can't be fucked to stay awake to trade ASX.

16-04-21,4fs7ch,"SunEdison Won't Go Bankrupt... And David Einhorn Might Have Proved My Point","Summary

Citing Rule 10b5-1 and 10b5-2, Einhorn and Greenlight would be prohibited to sell with knowledge of material, non-disclosed information.

SunEdison in late-stage negotiations to sell 450-MW to Hinduja Group.

The near-term cash flow is the driver to get a deal done and emerge strategically forward.

SunEdison is too big to fail on many levels. From the ""messy"" court proceedings to the billions in losses to private and public equity funds, the damage would be too far-reaching to not have a lifeline thrown the company's way. Further, the recent trading activity does not indicate an imminent bankruptcy. Yes, the stock is beaten down to .34 cents; however, millions of shares are still changing hands on a daily basis, leading me to believe that I am far from being alone with my prophetic thoughts of glory days ahead.

Love SUNE or hate SUNE, it's a 50/50 debate at this point in time. But one thing is for sure. Regardless of the pounding on the table by some media outlets about the company's future, no one outside of the Board room knows for sure what SunEdison plans to do in the immediate future.

In my opinion, SUNE management views the second half of the year as its entry into the promised land and will do everything possible, including asset sales, to deliver the company to serenity. And it can't happen fast enough - we all need some ""serenity now"".",144

16-04-21,4fsatf,Invest and ignore the oil market,"Enough already!

Yes, since late 2015, the stock market and oil prices have moved largely in tandem. Take the first week of trading, from Jan. 4 to Jan. 8, when the S&amp;P 500 Index fell 6%, and crude oil dropped nearly 10%. In fact, by my tally, there were only three trading days in all of January in which oil prices went one way and stocks the other.


But more recently, oil prices have started to decouple from stocks, and the two are now moving independent of each other with increasing frequency. In the past month or so, the S&amp;P 500 has rallied about 2.5%, while crude has declined slightly.

I currently work at one of the worlds largest commodity funds as a trader/analyst. 

I've developed a couple of quant strategies that have really impressive back testing results as well as some outstanding YTD results that have been been invested with &gt;$10m of capital. One particular strategy has a sharpe of over 3 and each trade is held for just 5 days. YTD the strategy is up over 15%. 

The point is I want more recognition (better comp) for generating these strategies. I also have a strong background trading relative value spreads based on fundamentals.

Basically, I'm tossing up whether to start my own fund or work at a prop shop. 

Does anyone have some well respectable proprietary trading firms that they think are worth reaching out to? Given my location, I'd like to work remotely but happy to relocate to Europe or the US.

Thanks!",1

What is interesting is the premarket bid/ask spread. The stock closed yesterday at ~$300. Today the Bid is now at $304.46 (up about 1.5%) but the ask is at a huge 396.50. Does this mean that if I wanted to buy pre-market I would be forced to currently pay 396.50 (the current ask price)? I know this is typically how it works but that must also mean that somebody with a large volume of SHW is offering up his shares at a much higher price to prevent anybody from getting in to the stock... is that possible? To prevent entry (with volume) by setting a extremely high ASK price?

I'm guessing because [this](https://beta.finance.yahoo.com/m/38878a0d-8aff-3ab0-ad39-2e1f6a97265c/%5B%24%24%5D-amd-to-license-chip.html?ru=yahoo?mod=yahoo_itp) was released after 4 pm today.

I'm not really an investor, I know almost nothing. I held onto these because I like AMD products over Nvidia, not a great reason but I didn't mind too much. It wasn't too much money and I didn't have the investing savvy to move it anywhere else anyways. 

I was just hoping I could spark up some discussion so I could leech some information about these shares I'm holding.
Also if someone could lend me some insight on these below listed topics that would be very appreciated.

- Predictions, where is this stock going?
- Long term or should I sell tomorrow and run with my profits. (Will this deal actually make AMD money or is the hype upping the share price? I get pretty hyped every time China get involved into anything.)
- After a few videos I still don't really get aftermarket trading anyone got a ELI5?
- Whats gonna happen tomorrow?
- Any big risks with holding onto these? Like I said I am quite fond of AMD, any reason I shouldn't be?

Sorry I have such basic questions. I kinda just lucked into this and wanted some good advice from some smart redditors.

Much thanks!

From a article earlier today:
Opko Health, Inc. (NYSE:OPK) announced that additional data on RAYALDEE as a treatment for secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) will be highlighted later today in a poster presentation at the Endocrine Society’s 98th Annual Meeting, underway in Boston, MA. The data showed that mean plasma levels of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and other markers of elevated bone metabolism gradually fell with RAYALDEE treatment as serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) rose above 30 ng/mL, a level considered sufficient for chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients in published clinical practice guidelines.

Opko Health, Inc. (NYSE:OPK) traded 2.44 Million shares and its share price moved up 1.01% to close at $11.04. Company has 6.20% insider ownership. Opko Health, Inc. (NYSE:OPK) quarterly performance is 40.10% while its year to date (YTD) performance is 9.85%.",22

16-04-21,4ftbva,KKD vs PZZA,"This may be a ""Low quality post"" complete with matching flair, but I wanted to ask it. I think these are both fair investments, but PZZA might be the better choice. KDD definitely has my interest and has been around for awhile, but I can't see how doughnuts will be more profitable than pizza in the long term. They both have international operations and recognizable brands, from my untrained eye it seems like they are making money and not filled with debt. There was a management shakeup with KKD a few years back that concerned me some since they are full of new faces now. As I understand it the ex president of PZZA is now at the helm.

I'm pretty positive that America will continue to be full of fatties so neither will go out of business soon. I could invest in both too, but I think I'll have better success concentrating into either or. I also thought about something like a restaurant ETF for this exposure as well. ",1
16-04-21,4ftbyf,Thinking of seeking a broker or financial advisor to make investments for me.,"Since I don't really have the time to follow markets intensively and try to make investments myself, i figured I'd have someone do it for me. Also, i feel like I'm missing out by having cash that is just sitting still.

What would you guys recommend I try to seek out for this? What type of person, what firm? Just general advice on how to approach this.

What type of investments should I be making? Mutual funds, etfs, etc. I'd really only have 5k to invest, but I'd likely add to this over time.

What are typical fees that a broker or advisor would take out, what's a good/bad commission rate?

I was thinking of finding a smaller office near me so I can easily stop in and stay in contact with them, if there's a small branch of a larger office, will this be much different?

Student loans are paid off, only payments are for my car I purchased in 2015 ($370/mo.), and I live at home with the parents (planning to for at least another year.

So today at work, we had a 401k meeting. My company provides the TransAmerica sage haven 401k plan if that matters. The company adds 3% of my salary without any contribution. The maximum I can put in per year is 18k. I am planning to do the prepay tax Roth IRA.

So now I ask the question, how much should I put in to the plan? I'm not spending anywhere close to the amount my paychecks are, so should I overload the account and accumulate a good amount of money early to have it grow for the life of the account? Or on the flipside, I'm probably moving out next year, but going to be paying rent for at least of two. Should I put a conservative amount into my Roth And save the rest of my money to save for a downpayment on a mortgage that could be in 3-4 years? I'm trying to see what route is more beneficial.

$ODP is trading at 6.31 and could jump to 7.25 + .22 * $SPLS or ~$9.50ish.  

Positives:

* The trial brought on by FTC is concluding and by all accounts, the Judge was not impressed by FTC's arguments [1](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-23/staples-judge-slams-ftc-for-false-testimony-in-office-depot-case).  

* The Staples lawyers also seem so confident that they didn't bother mounting a full defense ([source](http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/04/06/2016/stressed-out-office-depot-and-staples-await-judges-merger-decision)).  

* Another point is that Office Depot sold off their profitable printing business to someone else just today.  I can't help but think that Staples wouldn't have done it if they weren't extremely confident in the merger going thru.

Negatives:

* The judge said that there's no legal precedent that she can refer to

*  To my untrained ears, it does sound like a monopoly

The ruling is to happen any day now (thought it'd be today) and the merger is expected to be completed on [May 16](http://investor.officedepot.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=94746&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=2135004).  And May 30 calls at $9 strike are available at $0.30.

If oil recovers in 2017, right now is the cheapest it's going to be over the next decade. Look into these companies if you're interested in gainz without the stress of 3x ETNs...

This list is in no particular order, and while most of these companies have good financial health, a few may be on the verge of BK. **Bold** means market cap of $2B CAD or higher.

Canada based pure energy: 

* $GTE
* **$CNQ**
* $BTE
* **$WCP**
* $CNE
* $PWT
* $PGF
* $ATH
* $BNK (if the Geo Jade deal fails - if not, 20% upside)
* $PPY 
* $MEG
* $BNP
* **$TOU**
* **$PEY**
* $PXT
* EDIT: Forgot **$CPG**

Canada based mid-to-down-stream companies, including integrated and indirect energy plays:

* **$IPL**
* **$PPL**
* **$HSE**
* $CMG

US and elsewhere pure oil plays (don't know the market caps or financial health off the top of my head, bolding may be slightly inaccurate): 

* $SDRL
* $LINE/$LNCO
* **$EOG** 
* $PACD
* $IAE
* $ATW
* $SM
* $EPE (Near bankrupcy?)
* **$CHK**
* $FCX
* EDIT: Some great reddit suggestions: $WLL, $HOS, $KMI 

Other plays are possible, but they're either too small, too close to bankrupcy, or too big to have much upside. Some of the named companies like $EOG, $HSE, $PPL, and $CNQ may not double on an oil rebound because of their sheer size. 

From what I can recall, the finances of these companies are excellent: GTE, WCP, CPG, BNK, TOU, IPL, EOG, CMG

And these companies may be nearing insolvency: PWT, ATH, MEG, IAE, SDRL, EPE, and CHK (EDIT: forgot $LINE/$LNCO)",60

16-04-21,4ftr6n,Lets talk about taxes,"Alright you fucking turnips, listen up. Something that I never see mentioned here is the tax implications of all these poor life choices you keep making. Now, I'm not an expert by any means, and I'd like to preface this by reminding you that none of this should be taken as legal advice, but hopefully this will kick off a discussion where we can collectively gather a cohesive base of knowledge on this subject. If any of you see any mistakes in the following text, please correct me and then fuck your own face. This is just intended to be a guide -- seriously, see a CPA when you actually do your taxes. Additional insight is welcome and encouraged.


.


**Capital Gains/Losses**

A Capital Gain is the profit you make when you buy low and sell high. A Capital Loss is what happens to everyone in this sub. It's important to note that Capital Gains are separate from Earned Income and Investment Income. Furthermore, Capital Gains/Losses are split into two categories: Long-Term Capital Gains/Losses and Short-Term Capital Gains/Losses. Normally, a gain/loss on an asset held for more than a year is a Long-Term Capital Gain/Loss, and a gain/loss on an asset held for less than a year is a Short-Term Capital Gain/Loss. **Long-Term Capital Gains are taxed at 15% and Short-Term Capital Gains are taxed at the ordinary income rate (at least 28%)**. Also, your Capital Losses can offset some of your Capital Gains for tax purposes but seriously see a CPA about that. 


.


**The Wash-Sale Rule**

Under the Wash-Sale rule, you cannot deduct a loss if you have both a gain and a loss in the same security within a 61-day period (calendar days). However, you CAN add the disallowed loss to the basis of your security. Once again, see a CPA about this. It's not going to affect most of you, but just don't think that you can get a tax break by selling shares and then re-buying them at a lower price for a ""loss"". Remember: Everyone is smarter than you and you don't have any good ideas.


.


**The 60/40 Rule**

This is your Jesus, here to absolve you of your taxes and turn payments into profits. **The 60/40 rules stipulates that 60% of your total capital gain or loss will be treated as a long-term capital gain or loss, and that the other 40% will be treated as a short-term gain or loss.** However, with this rule the length of time that you actually hold a position doesn't matter. It's a blanket rule for certain types of contracts (regulated futures contracts, foreign currency contracts, and non-equity options (on debt, commodities, currencies, and **stock market indexes** (this is important, it's the difference between SPY and SPX (SPX is an index, SPY is not)) that are marked-to-market in trading).

To reiterate, the reason that this is so amazing is because long-term capital gains are taxed at 15% and short-term capital gains are taxed at the ordinary income rate (at least 28%).


.


**Two Percent Limit**

If you don't qualify as a trader to the IRS, you can deduct investment expenses and other miscellaneous itemized deductions only if they add up to more than 2 percent of your adjusted gross income. Say it with me: See a CPA.



.


Now, onto the things that would directly affect you if you weren't terrible at this:

**Day Trading** 

**Edit: This will not affect any of you, but it's important information to learn about in the event that you one day (somehow) make a career out of this. Once again, this is a guide, not advice, and do not do any of this without consulting a professional.** *credit to /u/WhatsToBeSaidNow*


Day Trading. Most of you here know what it means to be flagged as a PDT (Pattern Day Trader), but for anyone who doesn't, please refer to [FINRA](http://www.finra.org/investors/day-trading-margin-requirements-know-rules) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_day_trader).

[If you meet the IRS qualifications for being a trader](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc429.html) then you can fill out something called Form 3115, *Application for Change in Accounting Method*, and tell the IRS that you want to use the *mark-to-market election* in calculating your capital gains and losses. This basically means that instead of tracking your capital gains and losses, you ""sell"" your portfolio at the end of the year and ""repurchase"" it at the beginning of the new year so that all capital gains fall into income. This is a big deal because converting all of your capital gains to income means that your trades are no longer subject to the wash-sale rule and the two percent limit. This means lower taxes and less paperwork. In addition, you now can deduct 100% of business expenses regardless of your adjusted gross income. **However**, you no longer able to get the 15 percent rate on any long-term capital gains from your trading activities. Unless you work with listed options on market indexes (these are your SPX options homie), which are considered to show profits that are 60% long-term/40% short-term capital gains, you may not have any long-term capital gains from your trading activities.


.



These are just the basics. You can also trade from an IRA to avoid taxes on your trades and funnel money through a bunch of offshore shell companies and swiss bank accounts so that you can finally get your name in the [paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Papers#Clients_of_Mossack_Fonseca). There are a lot of complicated rules involving trading and you would do well to see a professional at tax time. However, this information is important for guiding your trading decisions now so that you can factor in the tax costs to your potential profits (from your *siiiiick* $100 SPY puts). 


**TLDR:** Consider the benefits of [Cash-Settled Index Options](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1bpxmo/monthly_condors_starting_to_trade_iron_condors_on/c98zc15) instead of non-leveraged ETFs. ",101

16-04-22,4fx8ah,More and more people will begin trading on crypto exchanges. It is a superior experience to other markets.,"I hear you fuming already: Mt. Gox!  Beanie Babies!  Pyramids!   
  
Fact is, crypto is here to stay.  And even though the underlying assets are not as prestigious as blue chip stocks like IBM and Disney (*yet*), trading on a decent crypto exchange is **undoubtedly** better than trading on almost any online brokerage in the world.  
  
Let's take my own favorite exchange Poloniex (but there are other good ones too like Bittrex, lest I be accused of shilling):  Trades are nearly free, costing just cents per trade.  Trades settle instantly with actual money, which you can withdraw as fast as that asset's blockchain allows.  Also, once you have crypto assets, money can flow easily into and out of the exchange for a fee of pennies.  
  
I can have bitcoins, move them to Poloniex, be trading in other blockchains within minutes, execute 100 trades that day, then withdraw either bitcoins or another asset that same day... All painlessly with no PDT regulations to worry about or any settlement periods.   
  
The only problem is the lack of worthwhile crypto assets to speculate/trade in!  This will improve in coming years, but for the moment there are still a few and already in 2016 people have made good money on crypto exchanges (and lost money too - nothing can be done without risk).

This year and next year I will have lots of free time and that is why I decided to give this a shot.


Here is my plan as a 20 year old guy:

-Buy all the necessary finance, economics, investment and strategy books and study.

-Take the time to fully digest all the knowledge I learned untill I know every bit of necessary information.

-Find solid and variety of news websites, apps etc.

Next step is very important!

-Use virtual money on real life markets, using online programs. Trade untill I make profit without guessing, but buy utilizing strategy.

-After 2 or 3 solid years of study and practice, start trading with real money.

+Starting budget of at least 10k-15k euros

__________________________________________

To me this looks like a realistic way to get into trading and make profit. I do not prioritize becoming rich, I want to see if I can earn money by using my knowledge. It's a way to challenge myself and later on once I get better at it I might go for much higher profits.

Are there some traders and investors here that can confirm my plan or give a feedback? I'd also like to see what you guys did to become a trader. Enthousiast starters like me should share their plan as well so we can learn from each other.

Thanks!

16-04-21,4fulup,Investing in the individual components of an ETF instead of the ETF itself?,"I got curious and looked up what the components of my Vanguard Dividend Growth Fund Investor Shares  (VDIGX) were.  

This fund has 49 holdings and they are listed publicly, as well as the share amount that is held in the fund.  I brought the data to excel, totaled all the shares in the fund, then divided each company's shares by the total shares to give me a percentage of the fund that is dedicated to each company.

On 3/14/2016, I invested $5000 in the fund, and as of yesterday, my total returns were $219.84.  I then took historical data of each company, the price that it closed at on 3/14, and the price that it closed at yesterday (4/20) and divided the latter by the former, giving me the percent change in price.  I then multiplied these percent changes by their weight, or, the percentage of the fund the company comprises.  Then I totaled these values to give me the overall weighted percentage change in price of the fund (1.0446), multiplied by my initial investment of $5000 to give me a return of $223.33, higher than the return of the fund itself.  

*And heres the kicker,* I was pulling my historical data from yahoo finance, which does not factor in dividends in the price change, this means any dividends that were added to my account were not factored into my calculation, meaning I could have made $5-$6 more just over that month and a week.  It doesn't sound like much, but take into account if you were investing $50,000, this would be $50 that the fund takes from you in a month, which would turn into over $500 a year, which can add up when compounded for many years.

TL;DR: ETF managers take a profit of your winnings for themselves, so why don't people just proportionally invest in the companies that comprise these publicly-displayed heavily-researched ETF's individually and keep all the returns for themselves?  Is it simply convenience?",0
16-04-21,4fumpm,Opportunity to hit the swing on XON,"So today Seeking Alpha posted a smear article that absolutely demolished XON's share price (currently down 27%) and I can't for the life of me find anything (other than that one article) that justifies such a huge fall. The company has a ton of things in the works besides just this Zika mosquito (they saw share price in the mid $60s last summer long before Zika came on the scene) and most of the ""claims"" in the SA article are completely unsubstantiated.

Not a guarantee here but barring some disastrous news that has yet to be released I have a very hard time seeing this not recover to the low $30s fairly easily. Just search ""Intrexon"" and see how many different projects they have going on, diabetes, cancer, Gene therapy, etc. 

The Florida petition also probably hurt the stock price, but really? Let's think about what segment of the population in FLORIDA participated in voting for/against the use of genetically modified organisms and tell me if that's at all surprising of a result.

The purpose of this scan is to find stocks about to pop or already popping.  Here's what I've got so far.  So I'm looking for input on what I've already got, and input on what I might add it help improve the results of the scan.  

Volume ... 300k and higher ... to ensure liquidity. 
Beta of 1 and up for increased volatility.
stock must be trading above its 250 EMA (borrowed from ""above the green line"" on stockcharts.com)
and OBV has increased for the last three bars. 
And, current volume increased at lease 50 percent from it's typical 50 period average.

These criteria deliver 31 results.  

What would you change/add/remove to improve the results of this scan?  

Growth stocks popping or about to pop is what we're looking for.  For what it's worth, at the closing bell, all the results from this scan had anywhere from .1 to 23.46 percent gains today.  No losses.  So at least that's a step in the right direction, right? ",6

Is there a broker that has low fees, accepts international (EU) members, has all stocks that you can buy shares from and has an easy registration, ie take a picture of your ID/passport, sign a pdf document and send files by email instead of going personally or having to go to your bank or library to scan files then lock them with a sign etc.

Update: 2 weeks later finally Degiro opened my account, it took that long because i gave them wrong IBAN number and it took time until we cleared things out. I just bought some shares.
I am pleased that they accept eastern Europeans and that the registration was really easy nothing to print, scan etc, everything made digitally.
The other thing is that they have a lot of stock, the top paying stocks with dividends are there when I search them.

So TL:DR is basically XON claims that the article published yesterday (which they say was actually written months ago because they received a similar copy with a Dec 2015 date but was just now released to the public) was essentially set up by a particular hedge fund who had a short position on the stock. FWIW the original source of this article (before SeekingAlpha put it on their site) has since deleted the whole piece, which I believe further detracts from the credibility of its content 

The article starts by claiming that ""high ranking officials"" from the CDC, WHO and NIH have ""questioned"" Intrexon's technology despite the fact that just last week the WHO recommended the use of that very same technology in South America 

http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/national-health-surveillance-agency-of-brazil-anvisa-to-grant-special-temporary-registration-for-oxitecs-ge-mosquito-575517161.html

http://www.oxitec.com/press-release-oxitec-report-96-suppression-of-the-dengue-mosquito-in-brazilian-trials/

Additionally, despite what the progressive and innovative citizens of Florida say about being worried with the ""environmental safety"" of XON's mosquito, the FDA came out over a month ago and declared their mosquito to be environmentally safe

1. Options have approximate price parity for a given strike, assuming you can short the underlying.

2. You pay a small premium when buying options, and you also get hit with fees and the old bid/ask spread. 

3. Stocks typically follow a lognormal distribution, except that stocks typically go up over time, and some stocks go up more than others.


My inevitable conclusion here, is that if you regularly buy faggots delights (calls) with your pocket money, you will eventually see almost double the profits of a straight long strategy.

I think the key to this strategy is to consistently use the money your granny gives you for getting good grades.

The further OTM you play, the longer it takes. If you persist during a market downturn, it will of course take even longer. If you deploy this strategy with more than your regular savings, your account will inevitably implode.",0

Got up in the morning, while sipping my coffee I looked at the $GOOGL stock price which was $775. Then I went to its options chain and looked at the price of ATM call and puts which were each going for $20. Adding them up I got $40. This is the movement that the markets are pricing in. 

So I opened a neutral position with a $720/725/825/830 Iron condor with $1.47 credit and max loss of $3.53. So my breakevens were $50 away from the current stock price and $10 away from what the market is pricing in. Got my order filled and then watched WSB the whole day for people who were building there air yachts with $825 FD calls.

4:30pm EST: Google misses earnings and shares start plummeting to $740 as we speak or down $41. Well the markets were pricing a $40 move, and this one prediction fell right in the range.

So it turns out I will make $147 from this trade off the $500 I used for margin. That's 29.4% profit in a day! YOLO enough?

Disclaimer: Don't jump into conclusions that you would always make money following my strategy. You will lose sometime. Remember LNKD earnings? I lost $700 that day with the same strategy. LNKD dumped 50% on a single. That is the day when FD's would have made bank. The lesson I learned from this:

1. Play only good companies with solid money in the bank.

To be fair, I wasn't financially able to really contribute actively to this account when I was a student (and later unemployed and searching for a job).

I just started my career and I've got about $8k in this Roth IRA, and I plan on moving this over to a TIAA mutual fund (preferably no-load with fairly low expense fees) and contributing $100 / month to dollar cost average.  Once I can afford it I want to get up to $450 / month to try to max out the yearly IRA contribution.

Is this a good move?  I don't want to pull this money out and put it elsewhere (i.e. indexed ETFs) because of early withdrawal penalties, etc.

She proceeded by showing a nice little chart based on a Harvard study on how 1$ invested in sustainable stocks in 1994 would have double the return today, supporting her argument that sustainable investments does pay off. (https://www.ted.com/talks/audrey_choi_how_to_make_a_profit_while_making_a_difference#t-452881)

Regardless, having some money on the side, I was getting interested in investing only in companies that stand for a better world. Issue is...beside Tesla and a couple of others I don't know of any and these stocks &amp; the info seems hard to find. Any advice on where to find a ranking of the US stock market ranked by ""good for the world""? thanks!

Clarification: The research claims sustainable stocks grew 2x more compared to non sustainable stocks. Not overall 2x more! I believe normal stock was 14x since '94 and a sustainable stock was 28x.",5

Hello! I will look into seeing a financial representative but I'd also like a little advice here. :)


I have an account with my inheritance. At the least it should be $10,000 in there, at most $25,000. This sounds weird but it got locked down and given to a guardian ad liam since my grandma was taking money out of it and shouldn't have been. I don't know how much interests it's acquired since then, and about $4,000 was taken out this year to pay the guardian. So $10,000 can be the base price. 

How old are you?

17 but I'll be 18 next month!


Are you employed/making income? How much?


I work part time at a fast food restaurant. I earn about $400 a month. 


What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)


I would like to have money saved up to buy a house and not be living paycheck to paycheck. 


What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)


I would like it 100% safe, since I don't know much about investing and I don't want to lose all my money. Sorry if this makes I harder, but I really don't have money to risk. 
What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)


I don't really have anything. I'm graduating high school in two months. 


Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)
Nope. 


What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?


Not really. I'd be willing to invest for 20 years, honestly. I want to make sure I can live comfortably after struggling through college. 


Any big debts?


No! Thankfully!


Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.


This is my inheritance which has been in account since my great grandma died until I turn 18. As much as I'd love to go on a designer shopping spree and fly to Tokyo, it's the smarter choice to invest.

To me this seems attractive on the face of it because the ETF portfolio seems to combine some active management (rebalencing the percentage of different growth sectors; some portfolios are based on industry indexes, others on large/small growth/cap, etc.) while at the same time using the index based approach of ETFs which from my research seems to make more sense to me then speculating or trying to beat the market or find someone to beat the market.

16-04-23,4g1oxu,8 credit cards or wait till home ownership?,"Hi there guys and gals, 22/m with a 766 FICO, 4 credit cards (WF College (1st card)), Barclay Sallie Mae, Cap1 Quicksilver, and Chase Freedom. I've been looking at getting the Discover IT card, the new Citi Costco card, and the Citi 2x cash card, and in the future, the Chase Slate.

My current outlook is to:
-Get the Citi Double Cash, and start maxing that out now. - Get the DiscoverIT and Citi/Costco card in July. - Turn 23. -Transfer balance from Chase Freedom (currently @ 0%) to Discover IT in November -&gt; pop the money that is allocated to pay the credit card into a 1y CD. - Once the 12mo/0% runs out on the Discover, Xfer that balance + whatever new balances I have open on other cards (Citi 2x cash + whatever other spend) to the Chase Slate, roll the money from the expired CD + the new allocated funds into another 1y CD. -Turn 24 -once the slate terms expire, pay off the entire amount, in full. -Turn 25 - loan/mortgage for house. I can get a co-signer with a favorable/long term history of credit.

Note 
- Discover is offering me 0% balance transfers + 0% for 12/mo on the balance transferred. - Special Offer-
-Citi 2x Cash terms = 0%/15mo., Citi/Costco terms = ????, Chase Slate = 0% for 15/mo, 0% on balance transfers for 60 days.

Reading around it seems that I should stop applying for credit cards 2 years before a big purchase. My only one that I would apply for (in 2017) would be the Slate - and that would be to ""consolidate"" debt. When applying for a home loan/mortgage, will I be screwed having 7-8 cards? Add in a co-signer who has good credit, and how many points would I lose on the mortgage negotiation? 

I'd cancel the Slate as soon as the balance is paid off, and if the Sallie Mae switches terms to something unfavorable its gone too, but everything else actively works for my savings strategy.

Before people ask:  
-I am using CDs because they are safe, and generate an 'OK' return. I'd rather get $37 off of a $3500 CD, than have to rely on market trends or other BS to pay off a credit card @ over 20% interest. No Netspend suggestions either please, way too much work.",0

16-04-22,4fzel4,401k Rollover to IRA = New Opportunity?,"When you have a 401k, you can request it be directly rolled over to an IRA account. People do this when they are not with the company where they opened the 401k.

When you roll over, the money in the 401k goes to the IRA but it's not invested in anything at that point. With the money in the IRA, would you invest all of it at once? Or do you slowly invest it over time to readjust your dollar cost average? I guess it depends on the current price of the stock and future expectations?

Let's say the stock is the S&amp;P 500 ETF. Right now it's near a high. So to put it all back into the ETF means your dollar cost average is around what it was before rolling it over.

But if you wait and expect S&amp;P 500 ETF to fall in the next 3-12 months, then you can lower your dollar cost average. Of course if it goes up, then your dollar cost average goes up.

16-04-22,4fzffb,Since CPU talk is the new hotness - intel,"Here I'll try and make a case for playing short strangles or straddles on intel in the short (next 2 months) term, which is not really related at all to AMD's (temporary) rally.

Looking at intel today we have a current price of 31.29, down from a December high of around 35.29, which in itself is part of a year long down trend.

Intel is facing shrinking consumer cpu markets, recently they're cutting 12000 jobs (a healthy thing in my opinion) and a lot of negative news.

right now we're looking at a implied volatility of 22.25% and a historical volatility of 15.90%.

I believe that volatility will decrease in the near term, closer to the historical volatility, and as intel bounces back from their recent downtrend. (remember, increasing price in the underlying causes lower volatility. it's why you get fucked on long calls so often.)

a good play would be short straddles or if you're more timid a short strangle.

--------------------

**Gambler's Fallacy** - the belief that once an event has occurred, it is less likely to repeat
 
**Hot-Hand Fallacy** - the belief that once an event has occurred several times in a row, it is more likely to happen again
 
**Representativeness** - judging how representative a situation is to past events
 
**Confirmation Bias** - tendency to search for or interpret information that confirms your preconceptions

**Escalation of Commitment (linked to Sunk Cost Fallacy)** - investing additional resources into a failing course of action - ""throwing good money after bad"" - Staw (1976)
 
**Regret Aversion** - fearing to go back on a decision, maybe to save your reputation or fearing the emotion of regret itself (linked to Esc. of Commitment)
 
**Illusion of Control** - exaggerating the degree to which one can control their own fate (e.g. rolling a dice hard when needing a big number; rolling soft/slowly for a small number)
 
**Disposition Effect** - selling winning stocks too early and holding onto losing stocks for too long (commonly referred to as ""break-even-itis"", only holds up if you truly believe in prices reverting back to mean value over time)
 
**House Money Effect** - gambling more after winning a sum of money (i.e. gambling winnings (house money) doesn't feel like your money so you become more risk-seeking with it, despite it really being part of your total wealth)
 
**Overconfidence** - people overestimate how much they actually know or how good they are (e.g. Lichtenstein &amp; Fischhoff (1977) - 47% of participants' stock predictions were correct, but the mean confidence rating was 65%)
 
**Endowment Effect** - giving more value to items you own
 
**Hindsight Bias** - seeing past events as being obvious/predictable after they've happened (e.g. stock market crashes in history seeming obvious when looking back)

I mean, if I expected a long-term average 5 % ROI on the investment annually. After taxes the annual profit is something like 5000, which when added with a portion from my salary would easily cover the mortgage payments. But is this sensible? Or realistic?

I don't know. What would you do? And house or no house, what kind of things would you invest your money in, if you have that much money but it's still the only money you have? Meaning it would have to be something mid-risk at best.

16-04-23,4g5svq,"I'm trying to decide on which renewable energy stocks to purchase (they all pay dividends).","I'm expecting the renewable energy sector to grow since the cost of solar and wind power has drastically gone down over the past decade, and it's very likely to keep dropping. The sector would definitely expand IF electrical grids are upgraded to handle the rather unstable power generation, and if a battery technology breakthrough makes it onto the market.

I've been trying to consider which companies should I prioritize purchasing and holding long-term. I've done some minor research on the four stocks (including checking Simply Wall St's website).

The four companies are: NextEra Energy Inc ($NEE), 8Point3 Energy Partners LP ($CAFD), NRG Yield, Inc ($NYLD), and Pattern Energy Group Inc ($PEGI).

I decided to not look at NEP, because it issues Schedule K-1s, and I am not willing to pay extra for more advanced tax return software or tax accountant to do the paperwork. I recall asking on Reddit if it's feasible to do Schedule K-1s by hand, and the consensus was ""Good luck with that"".

I've also looked at Hannon Armstrong ($HASI), but I'm a bit hesitant to invest in a company that does debt/equity financing, especially with the low energy prices and the uncertain economic situation.

There's a 6th company that I briefly looked at, which was TerraForm Power Inc ($TERP), and I'm staying away from it because I can't tell if SUNE's bankruptcy would also drag down the yieldco.

EDIT: I have several thousand dollars available for stock purchasing, and some of the money is in my Roth IRA (still waiting on Vanguard to clear my deposit so I can buy stocks).",9

16-04-23,4g32mj,"$ARRY - DD with 2 Phase 3's + NDA coming before end of June","Array biopharma primarily target cancer treatments, although they also have research in progress for Asthma and Hep-C

They have a mix of collaborations and self run projects, with the collaborations (with the likes of Roche, Loxo, Astra Zeneca, Celgene) being paid for by the sponsors.

They have 2 Phase 3 and 1 NDA filing before end of June:
http://www.arraybiopharma.com/product-pipeline/selumetinib/ ph 3 with AZN

To date, Array has earned $26.5 million in up-front and milestone payments and is entitled to receive approximately $30 million in potential additional development milestone payments and royalties on product sales.

http://www.arraybiopharma.com/product-pipeline/binimetinib/

This include data from the Columbus trial:
In addition, Array expects top-line results from Part 1 of the COLUMBUS trial in the first half of 2016 and projects a regulatory filing of binimetinib and encorafenib in 2016.  The MILO Phase 3 study in patients with low-grade serous ovarian cancer continues to enroll patients, and Array estimates enrollment to be complete in 2016 with the availability of top-line data, along with a projected regulatory filing, in 2017. - 

and the NEMO NDA
Array plans to submit binimetinib to regulatory authorities for marketing approval in NRAS-mutant melanoma during the first half of 2016.  Results from the NEMO trial including progression free survival, overall survival, objective response rate, safety and prespecified subgroup analyses including outcomes in patients who received prior treatment with immunotherapy will be presented at a medical conference in 2016.   

Currently ARRY is trading at $3.25

In addition to the upcoming trial results above, they also have an additional PH3, and 10 Phase 2 trials, with 3 Phase 1 trials in their pipeline.

The stock was up around $8 last year, but has since dropped with the combination on Jan/Feb bad times for biotech, along with minimal progress on their research, but it is starting to pick up again.

It has moved from 2.50 in Feb to 3.25 today, so it hasn't yet made the 100% jumps we often see when bios are being pumped pre data release.

There is also a very high open interest in June $4 calls that are selling for around 0.20 - (for newbs, this means that someone has paid for the right to buy this stock at $4 on the 20th June, and have paid 0.20 for the right to do so, so need it to be above $4.20 to make a profit)

ARRY currently make up around 20% of portfolio, I have stock, Jun 3.5 calls and Jan 4 calls.

I expect this to hit $6 mid June, and with good news on both trials be up around $13, even if both fail, with such a strong pipeline, I would see a fall back to $3, so I can see little downside at the moment in this stock. 


TL;DR - Lots of stuff in the pipeline, 3 things due by end of June that, I and option buyers believe will push the price way past $4, likely to $6, then up to $13 if good results.

I was hoping to buy 50k worth of contracts at a time so that the gains could really add up, but I think that amount is not liquid in most cases. Can anyone suggest companies or funds I could buy 50k to 100k worth of contracts at a time. 

Also I don't always have enough money to exercise the options. So in that situation where I don't have enough money to exercise the options and they're too illiquid to sell at the market value what am I supposed to do exactly?

I read somewhere that I'm supposed to short the stock and then exercise the options. Or should I exercise each contract one at a time and sell the corresponding stocks. I'm pretty new at this so if you could suggest anything I should read I would really appreciate it.

16-04-23,4g4bpc,"My Top 4 Emotional Investment Mistakes, What are Yours?","#1 Overconfidence 

“People think they know more than they do” Robert J. Shiller, Irrational Exuberance. People often become overconfident in their skills, knowledge, and ability to predict the future. This overconfidence can be a disaster for someone trying to make money in the marketplace. 

Overconfidence causes you to trade more frequently. Research from Brad Barber and Terrance Odean tells us that the more frequently you buy and sell the more you loose. It's okay to be confident, just don’t let your confidence affect your investment methodology. 

#2 Disposition Effect 

Naturally we are scared of regret and always seeking to protect our pride. This disposition effect is what causes investors to sell winners early and hold onto losers too long.  In search for prideful validation investors often sell winners early to gain some sort of self recognition as a “successful investor”. 

Buy or sell because of your research, not because of your emotional needs! 

#3 House Money Effect 

Most oftenly seen with gamblers, but investors also fall victim to the House Money Effect. When an investor gains above average returns, they become more risky with their new profits. If you went to the casino, bet everything on red, and made $5,000.00 dollars, odds are that you will become uncharacteristically reckless with your winnings.  

Don’t let winnings get to your head. 

#4 Loss Then Risk Aversion Effect 

After incurring huge losses, we start believing that we will always lose. The market has taken huge recessions, but those who stayed strong and believed in their investments have overcome their losses. The future is not dictated by your past, do your research, and believe in your investments.

* Not overlap at all (only specialize in their respective category, ie close to 100% small cap growth)
* Have historically good returns over 10-20+ years
* Have a money manager who has been there for most, if not all, of the good returns over the 10-20+ years
* Have reasonable fees (returns with fees over time frame still beat the market)

This narrows down to a small amount of mutual funds that he says are safe bets. Of these he says to pick one type of fund of each and invest equally every month:
 
1. Large Cap Growth
2. Large Cap Value
3. Small Cap Growth
4. Small Cap Value
5. International Stock

When the money manager changes, then wait a year or two to see how that manager does (with your money still in) and change to another fund to replace that one for the time being. At the end of the two years continue to invest in the one that seems to be doing better.

What are your thoughts on this? He showed us if we did this 30-40 years ago we would've seen returns around 8-12% annually.

What are your thoughts on this? When I graduate should I follow the common advice (at least online) to stick with index funds and etf's? Is he just a crazy old man (who got lucky, is rich, and has many happy clients)? He's not making money off of lying to us and generally just loves teaching this.

He also showed us how to find these funds using a software called Thomson InvestmentView, but said it was expensive and was only sold to financial advisors, so we would need one to find these funds.",13

 -- I tried out the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive tonight at a friends house. I spent 15 min playing the Oculus and 2 hours playing the Vive. As soon as I got home I excitedly [ordered](http://i.imgur.com/rHnRtOf.jpg) the HTC Vive. Take my fucking money...

It's clear the HTC blows the Rift out of the water in this round. The experience with the Vive is completely emersive and really incredible. I haven't been more excited about a gaming technology in the past 15 years.

One thing to note, something is up with the Oculus shipments. Rumor has it that something is wrong with the headsets and they are having to fix every unit before shipment. Hardly anybody who preordered has received their headsets yet. Many are cancelling orders and jumping ship to the better reviewed Vive.

VR is set to explode, but HTC is the early winner in my opinion. Don't count out FB though, they have the money to do great things with this. My friend is selling his Oculus... currently at a $1200 bid on eBay. He got it for ""free"" for being an original Kickstarter backer ($300 for a DEV kit).

Say a guy spotted an opportunity to make some profit by lending money to a place with higher interest rate than the place he borrowed the money from, while having a FRA to prevent any kind of disaster regarding sudden exchange rate changes. The question is rather... how can a person get that kind of borrowing to begin with? For the sake of argument, let's put the amount to 10M USD. 

Is this kind of operation even doable for common mortals? Or is it only accessible for people who actually are within something like a hedge fund, investment bank, etc?

Is it smart to sell something for a loss if it is to buy something that is also down? I had no available cash to buy MSFT otherwise.
In this particular case, of course, CC did fall further, but then bounce back to ~5% loss on the day, while MSFT drifted down to about 7%.  But is it generally ok to sell a down stock to buy another down stock if you think the later will recover better?

If FB misses earnings, which is within the realm of possibility (though highly unlikely), it's all downhill from here.
The market's ignoring a poor earnings season due to the fed not increasing rates. It has to happen sometime, and when it does, you best believe errything'll be shitting a brick.

On top of that, if oil goes down again before the summer demand increase, there'll be a catalyst for another sell off. I speculate she's waiting for oil prices to rise more before she increases rates.

Look at gold prices. They've been at year highs since the sell off in January and they still haven't come down, even though the S&amp;P's just bounced off 2100!

Anyway, he puts forward the case for cash value policies 

- 4% to 6% return with low to zero volatility (hard to believe)

- 15% capital gains on all profits (deferrable, supposedly)

- ability to use ""loans"" to avoid increasing annual income or
incurring capital gains tax

- the ability to stick large amounts of money (that has already been exposed to taxes) into a fund upfront without having the subsequent interest accumulation taxed until it is withdrawn (again, deferrable with loans)

- no mandatory distributions and no penalties for closing a policy
(beyond capital gains tax), but most of the analysis doesn't include
closing the policy and thus assumes that the remainder will be passed on via inheritance.

- also no mention of alternative minimum tax being applied, upon
policy closeout not due to death.

- no comparison with Roth IRAs (the ability to fund the policy via a large lump sum is somewhat interesting... something you can't do with an Roth IRA)

Also, transferring the position to another brokerage doesn't count as an early disbursement, right? So no 10% withdrawal penalty?",2

16-04-24,4g8ova,Covered Call - First Trade (in the money),"Hi,

I am wanting to write my first covered call.  I'm looking any expertise from more experienced traders before I execute.  
 

My goal/""plan"":

Buy stock XYZ 100 shares @ $5.50 = -$550
Write 1 ""in the money"" option for June 17 with a strike price of 5 for $1.40 (x100) = +$140
 
Calculations:

Break Even Price: 

$5.50 - $1.40 = $4.10

Maximum Loss: 

$4.10

Maximum Gain: 

-$550 + $140 + $500  = $90 Gain (from option being exercised)


More about this stock:  

It's volatility is fairly high, and I do expect that the option will most likely be exercised.

The volume is not high for options for this tock.

Questions:

Will the buyer most likely exercise the option in a case like this?  (I have heard that most options are not exercised, but it seems that ""itm"" options would be more often?)

Is there anything else I should know, having never bought or sold options before?

Is my math correct?

Thanks in advance :)",8

Any who long story short companies are getting more brazen at giving investors non-GAAP financials to make their profits look a lot rosier than they are, sometimes turning losses into profits.

That said, I've done some research and so far I've seen that both silver and gold have had a similar reaction to the last 5 fed meetings in terms of percent gained/lost.

The big difference with this week's fed meeting is that last weeks [CFTC results](http://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/cftc-silver-speculative-positions-1621) show a new 52wk high for speculators. Up 14.24% from the previous week. Silver also just broke out of its $16 resistance level. This has me thinking that silver may have a bigger potential upside than gold this week.

My main issue with this is how to play it. NUGT/DUST outperform gold by a huge margin. Much higher than 3x the price of gold. For example, at the last fed meeting, /GC gained 2.4% and NUGT gained 22.6%.

I can't find a 3x leveraged silver miners ETF anywhere, and I believe this is the key to sweet fucking gainz. That or a futures account, but I ain't that guy.

I had trouble finding a stable career after college and found my passion recently in education.  I start my new career in late July and will enroll in my employer's 403b plan that uses TIAA-Cref.

I am partial to index funds and thought Betterment could be an option. I hope to have a total of 12k invested by the time I reach 30.",7

&amp;nbsp;

* had 1400 positions in stocks at once

* had 60% of its capital in 200 positions

* had a win/loss ratio of roughly 60/40

How did this happen? I can't wrap my head around the sizes and amounts of his positions and how it managed to produce such amazing returns. 

How did he choose companies to invest in, and then the weight at which to invest in those positions? How is what he did SO different from buying an index?

Someone please explain it to me. I understand Buffett's, Graham's, Greenblatt, etc. strategies; they're all fairly similar value investors. Lynch stands out and I don't get it. Please explain how he got those returns.

Recently got into stocks, and I was able to convince my wife that every year for my daughter's birthday (she just turned two) and around Christmas time that we should spend a little bit less money on toys (that she'll forget about in a month anyway) and buy her a couple of different stocks each year.

We already have money invested in a Fidelity 529 and index fund for when she goes to school--so this isn't our investment plan for her education or anything--but I thought it would be great/fun if I could give her a little stock portfolio too when she turns 18. 

Anyone currently doing this for their kids? What do you guys think would be some good long-term stocks that I can get her that would still (probably) be killing it in 16 years when I give it to her when she turns 18.

Does short capex weight harder than guided revs from these initiatives?  Brick and mortar retail has seen notoriously hard times, and many aren't optimistic.

It seems to me that there are cheaper alts that offer a relatively similar shopping experience/quality product for &lt; or = to the same cost, with the added benefit of the consumer being able to buy other things at the same store i.e. (target, BBBY, and of course AMZN).

16-04-26,4ggdvj,Having trouble with a real estate question regarding escrow.,"I am selling a very modest cabin for 15,000.  I want to sweeten the deal for the buyer by adding a decorating allowance.  But I am confused how best to approach this.  My idea is to sell the property for 15k cash and offer a 3k budget for improvements.  BTW I have about 3k in credit via plastic. But if I ask the buyer to place 3k in escrow and, for any reason, they don't like the upgrades to the property, they can withhold the escrow funds at will, right?   So what is the best way to offer this type of contract to any potential buyer?  I could require that the buyer purchase the property and then simply trust that I will improve the property to their liking, but this then puts them in a compromised spot.  I am really perplexed here. Anything helps, thank you!",4

Not sure if this is a good place to post this question, but in the Chinese bond market, something stunned people on April 20. Information about this bond is not available in English, so I can translate it for information.

Amounts below are in Chinese Yuan (1 USD = 6.5 Yuan)

Bond ID: 018003

Issuer: China Development Bank (a state-owned financial institution with a total shareholders' equity of ￥６８０ billion and its shares are not traded on any public stock exchange as it is completely state-owned).

Total outstanding bond for this series: ￥2.5 billion

Par Value: ￥１００

Coupon: 5.85%

Issue date: 2014-04-17

Maturity date: 2029-04-17

This is where it gets interesting. At the time of the issuing of this bond, a 1 year CD (remember, this was 2014 and China) yielded 3.２５%, and a 5-year CD (longest possible term) yielded 5.1%. So, in this context, a 15 year bond, to the market, is only slightly riskier than a 5 year CD.

Because of economic slowdown, beginning in November 2014 to the end of 2015, CD interest rates were cut repeatedly until they hit 1.75%. Bond prices move inversely to yields and that sent the price of that bond up to ￥１３０, or trading at 30% premium to par.

This could be a fluke, but on April 20, without any changes in interest rates, all of a sudden, amidst low volume, the bond price plunged 20% and the exchange halted trading for this bond. It appears that on low volume, the price of the bond recovered to where it was trading prior to the crash.

What am I worried about? Well, I had not invested in bonds in China. But I know that a wide scale bond crash of this magnitude is far more serious than a stock market collapse. When stocks go to zero, it's just ""equity"" that is gone, but if debt goes to zero, then...the financial institutions really get hit. When this happens, we really could have a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. Remember, a stock market crash on its own doesn't usually do a lot of damage (e.g. 1987, 2000). But if a bond market crash also happens, that is when the most damage is done and large recessions occur.",6

16-04-26,4ggtei,High Frequency Dividends,"Hey all,

I did some searching but there seems to be almost nothing on how the frequency of a dividend payment can affect performance, and only minimal resources online from a google search. The info out there I was able to find(see bottom of post), and my intuition, does seems to suggest that a higher frequency of dividend payout increases performance... Although some of it seems like marketing and gimmicky.

Anyone out there have any thoughts on this? Do you have any funds that you like that payout frequently? I am mostly all in on a target date fund but it only pays out once a year, while something like VTI (which is part of the target date fund from Vanguard) pays out 4x a year, and there are funds that pay 12x a year (http://www.bestdividendetfs.com/dividend-distribution/monthly/1.html)

If this was the case it would be +EV or me to go full short on a near 50/50 bet and then if I lose, I just skip on paying them back.

16-04-26,4ghesc,Need advice on how I should go about getting paid with company stock/ shares from a company I’m about to join that has no capital to pay a salary at the moment.,"Hello I was hoping for some advice on how I should go about getting paid with company stock/ shares from a company I’m about to join that has no capital to pay a salary at the moment. So the problem for now is I don’t know how much stock/ shares I should ask for as compensation, considering there is no capital for salaries at the moment. I know this doesn't sound like a good idea, to take no salary at first, but the company has the potential to really take off.

The company I want to join has been around for a few years, but recently shed all their workers and essentially needs to fill all positions. I’m going for President / COO, and CTO. I’ll be managing most of the business as President/ COO, as well as setting up the ecommerce platform and online marketing for the company as the CTO. 

The company was valued at 9million when it was founded about five years ago, but that valuation is much lower now, lower than 4 million, maybe as low as 1 million I suspect. They have 100 shares total, and they are currently offering investors a 1% share of the company for a $40,000 investment.
I suspect each share is worth much less in reality, but this is what they are sticking at for now.

So when I go in and ask for the President/ COO and CTO positions, I want to be able to ask for more shares in the company, since the salary would not initiate for at least a month, maybe longer. So what should I do?
TLDR: How many shares should a President/ COO get paid if there is no salary for a month or two? How much should a CTO get paid in shares if there is no salary for a month or two? How many shares should I ask for if I fulfill these two positions, but don’t get paid a salary for a few months? Thanks!",1

Notice the 3 blue lines. Those are key points I picked out looking only at the 2014 spike buildup. TRTC has been behaving very similarly to what it did 2 years ago, but it's been a little faster on the moves this time. 

It hit .40 on Jan 9 2014, dropped to around .25 on Jan 17, broke up to .60 on Feb 6, retreated to .40 by Feb 11, then hit around .60 and settled for a few weeks at .50 until March 6, when it shot to 1.40 by Mar 12. 

Compare that to its recent moves:

.40 on Mar 28, .25 on Mar 30, .60 on Apr 19, .40 on Apr 22, and now we're moving back up, closing just under .50 yesterday. 

The MACD and RSI(14) lines also have similar patterns around these timeframes, but I think it's been moving faster in the current action due to the higher volume.

Another useful tool investors use is Price / Earnings Ratio. P/E ratio will determine how ""inflated"" a stock may be. Any stock with a p/e ratio of 15 or greater is generally ""inflated""
Price per Earnings ratio is calculated by: (current price / Earning per share)
For a fun joke, look up the P/E ratio of Amazon and Netflix. Haha!

The Directors of Antares Energy Limited (ASX:AZZ) are pleased to advise of the execution of two independent Purchase and Sale Agreements with the same Private Equity purchaser for the sale of Northern Star in the amount of 148,788,560 USD and Big Star in the amount 105,069,420 USD. 


&amp;nbsp;
   
The closing of these two independent Purchase and Sale Agreements with the same Private Equity purchaser will be on or before the 30th November 2015 and is subject to usual commercial closing conditions and adjustments. The gross pretax proceeds from these transactions are expected to be approximately 250,000,000 USD which will be subject to customary closing adjustments, taxation and frictional costs.

&amp;nbsp;


**11th of September: Trading Halt**- ASIC and ASX have requested a copy of the purchase and sale agreement for review and Antares is pleased to provide this.


&amp;nbsp;


**15th of September: Suspension** - Share price soared from $0.09c to $0.50c while it was allowed to trade.

&amp;nbsp;

Antares Energy Limited (ASX:AZZ) has been advised by the ASX that it must disclose the identity of the Purchaser of the Northern Star &amp; Big Star Projects pre-market today. The ASX has advised that failure to identify the Purchaser will result in the suspension of the Company’s securities from trading, pursuant to Listing Rule 17.3. Antares Energy will not disclose the identity of the Purchaser as it believes this will be detrimental to Antares’ shareholders, note-holders and other stakeholders.

&amp;nbsp;



""The ASX argues that shareholders need to know the buyer to judge the likelihood of the deal’s completion. The company argues that the bid is all cash so the buyer’s identity is irrelevant. They also claim that disclosing the buyer now may imperil the deal.""

During the period over which the transaction with Wade Energy was originally negotiated and the relevant purchase and sale agreements executed, the oil price traded in an approximate price range of US$45 to US$50 a barrel. Since the extension to the reset date of the Convertible Notes from the 30 October 2015 to 31 March 2016, the oil price has traded down to less than US$27 a barrel in both January and February 2016. Subsequently, the oil price has traded up to greater than US$40 and is currently trading around the US$40 per barrel level.  

&amp;nbsp;

**The amended purchase and sale agreements with Wade Energy (executed on or around 4 December 2015) failed to complete on the extended completion date of 15 January 2016, however the agreements remain on foot.** 

&amp;nbsp;

Antares continues to engage with Wade Energy in relation to a potential transaction as the oil price approaches the level it was at the time of the original transaction.


&amp;nbsp;


**31st of March, 2016** - NOTEHOLDER MEETING


&amp;nbsp;

Notes reset date. Antares Energy are out of cash and noteholders are now eligible for the $25M AUD payment.  Antares Energy didn't sell their assets, and as a result, have little cash in the bank remaining - unable to pay noteholders until their assets in the Permian Basin are sold.

&amp;nbsp;

**Noteholders meeting takes place to extend notes for another year**

&amp;nbsp;

Another noteholders meeting was recently held.  Antares Energy wish to extend/reset the notes for ONE YEAR in order to give management more time to sell their assets as oil prices rise/stabilize.  

&amp;nbsp;

**RESULT:**

&amp;nbsp;


Antares Energy Limited (ASX:AZZ) (""Antares"" or the ""Company"") advises that at yesterday's meeting of convertible noteholders (Noteholders), the Noteholders resolved to adjourn the meeting until 12.00pm (WST) on 29 April 2016.   



&amp;nbsp;



They are granted one month to give noteholders more time to think about passing their resolution and give management more time to sell the permian basin assets.

&amp;nbsp;  

[Antares Energy wins time to raise cash] (https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/wa/a/31227217/antares-wins-time-to-raise-cash/) 


&amp;nbsp;

**Conclusion**


&amp;nbsp;


Antares Energy are STILL in suspension and cannot trade.  People over at the HotCopper forums have lost their life savings - people even in retirement. This suspension has caused people to emotionally break and people were  unable to see their families for Christmas, or have an eventful holiday due to what has happened here. People were fed lies from the first announcement - putting faith in the company and all of it's announcements, and put faith in the ASX for letting this trade post-purchase and sale agreement announcement (for up to two days). 

&amp;nbsp;

This is such an unfortunate series of events, and I want to know what everyone's opinions are of this matter? 

&amp;nbsp;

I did not start off with much and its not been easy for me to add more money thats not already the money I started with. I only buy stocks that look like NJR, that are boringly consistent over at least a 20 year span. I am wondering if I can charge people like a subscription fee, to tell people what stocks to buy, and when to buy and sell them. I actually started a website to do such a thing and when I told a friend about it and he told me it might be illegal since it could be considered stock manipulation if enough people are subscribed. I feel like I read somewhere a while back saying it's illegal, however I cant seem to find anywhere saying the contrary. Any thoughts ?

step 1. i am thinking identify high-buzz companies with earnings coming out.
http://www.businessinsider.com/wall-street-questions-for-tech-company-earnings-2016-4


so.. earnings release
          tues
aapl - 104.56
twtr - 17.25
ebay - 24.22
          wed
fb - 110.49
          thurs
amzn - 627.01
lnkd - 121.00
p - 9.37

Let us assume that they are all going to NOT IMPRESS. meaning that none of their earnings are going to beat enough to cause a SPIKE in stock price.

going to use a bear call spread option strategy 
http://www.theoptionsguide.com/bear-call-spread.aspx

because implied volatility should be higher pre earnings - let see

~ 9:30 - 10:00


implied volatility for the 1 week near money calls
aapl - 28.3%
twtr - 71% {&lt;-wow}
ebay - 40%
fb - 38%
amzn - 41%
lnkd - 65% {&lt;-wow}
p- 76% {&lt;-wow}

okay gonna drop 
appl, amzn, fb, ebay

going to sell the option spread on twtr, lnkd, p with the intention of profiting from the high implied volatility.

Useful comments. I intend to go sell before 12. I will also keep those who are interested posted. 

update.
dropping pandora, linkedin options from strategy , volume too low, spread too wide., replacing with ebay and amzn.

Remember we have the Fed meeting this week. NFLX looks stuck. So in hopes that Yellen scares the market NFLX should take on even more loses.

16-04-26,4glad4,Trading US stocks on European exchanges,"Hi, European here.

I used to trade each stock on their main listed exchange, which for US stocks was mostly NASDAQ for me. I used the broker's currency exchange service to convert EUR-&gt;USD-&gt;EUR, it took only 0.5% on the mid-rate, this worked fine.

However, due to reasons I have a new broker which takes almost 3% when exchanging currency per transaction. I don't want to start off with a 6% loss, and looking at my options I found out some stocks trade on multiple exchanges, sometimes even in euro when they are originally listed in dollar.

Two examples I have in my portfolio right now are AAPL and BRK.B. I found out both are also traded in Frankfurt, AAPL as APC.F, and BRK.B as BRYN.F.

I find very little documentation on what these are, what this phenomon is called (to be able to google it) and even less on how to ""figure out"" which are traded where.

Except for the obvious differences that I can think of (selling/buying realises both stock profit/loss and currency exchange profit/loss at the same time, trading times are different, less volume/liquidity), is there anything else I should be aware of when trading these stocks? Are these most definitely a better trade than trading on the US exchanges and incurring currency exchange rate loss, or are there hidden tricks involved that also lowers profitability?

Any hidden currency exchange losses or maintenance fees, things like that? I'm assuming that due to arbitrage these stocks at least  on the overlapping hours trade at almost exactly the same price as their original listings across the big pond, at the mid-market rate of USD/EUR at that point. Am I wrong?

This would be for medium/long-term investing (at least 6 months to decades).

Its first equity crowdfunding platforms CrowdPlus.asia, Alix Global, Crowdo and others were licensed by the Securities Commission of Malaysia (SC) in June 2015 and now operate on the market. The SC, as a financial market regulator, has notedly taken a slightly laissez-faire approach to ECF, allowing enough room for the operators and issuers to form the market.
If Malaysian ECF operators are successful in their endeavors this development is undoubtedly to give impetus to other countries of the region to develop their own legislation in this direction. The next possible country to embrace this fundraising method will probably be Singapore where crowdfunding currently falls under the Collective Investment Scheme regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. 
This development should be interesting for all inner and outer investors interested in working with Asian market for it will facilitate and diversify options available. Or shouldn't it?

16-04-27,4gpt9b,The biggest misunderstanding about technical analysis is thinking it gives you direction.,"I saw that post about TA yesterday, and seeing the number of upvotes I understand why so many people are turned off by it.

It's hard to think of a car as useful if you believe that it's a yacht.

Technical analysis gives you targets, not direction. It's no mystery that the market closes on moving averages or opens on them.

Support and resistance aren't walls that a rubber ball bounces off of. They're webs that slow down momentum. When the market hits a support, it'll often stop there for the day, and give market participants time for a pause to think. They're obstacles that tell people, OK it's time to take a step back, and re-evaluate, kind of like when an army advances, it'll advance quickly until a strategic point (support/resistance), then send out scouts (overshooting then coming back) to see if it's safe to advance any further. If it is, then they advance quickly to the next strategic point, otherwise they retreat.

Strategic points tell you nothing about what lies ahead. A top of a hill is a good place to rest and set up camp, it doesn't mean that every hill you encounter means ""TURN BACK NOW, YOU'RE GOING TO GET MASSACRED AHEAD"".

In fact, stock trading is very similar to war. Bulls vs. bears. Every strategic point is basically the trenches/battleground between the two armies. You'll have mercenaries who change camps, and you'll also have allies who'll come help (big hedge funds entering a position) send in huge reinforcements. News are similar to getting ammunition or a natural disaster. AAPL bulls losing to the bears yesterday was because the bears suddenly got a huge drop-off of weapons and ammunition. When companies beat earnings, it's like the bulls just got an ammunition drop-off, but then a horrible guidance is telling them that the bears have lots of tanks further ahead, and that they should retreat, because machine guns can't beat an M1 Abrams.",47

16-04-27,4glvdg,FedEx Line Haul contracting,"Hello everyone

Thanks in advance for your knowledge, help and insights on this investment situation.

First of all I would like to give a quick summarization and objective for this post.
Goal-receive insight on taking necessary steps to become a FedEx line haul contractor from the perspective of a new corporation.
Post- With all information considered what are the most appropriate and effective steps to take to become a contractor.

I am very interested in becoming a contractor for FedEx line haul and have extensively researched routes and FedEx. I have looked to acquire routes by purchasing established routes from current contractors and also looked at the FedEx website for new contractor opportunities. Which neither has brought forth any real opportunities for me to become a FedEx line haul contractor or provide more information on how to become a contractor. 

If someone may be interested in these opportunities there are many requirements and avenues to consider in pursuing this particular investment. Some things that an investor would need to consider are: 
-FedEx new ISP contracts and how that effects either purchasing or becoming a new contractor. All contractors must be on ISP contracts by 2020. How does that effect your strategy in becoming a contractor?
-FedEx requires being a corporation to be a contractor. If you were forming a new transportation corporation would a new corporation be seriously considered for a new contractor opportunity? Or if the new corporation were to purchase an existing route would FedEx approve the sale? 
-Financing. There are many avenues for financing and the two most popular resources are traditional and private. Both have their own positives and negatives. Is either preferred over another by FedEx? 

I had many other thoughts I wanted to express to receive insights about FedEx and becoming a contractor, in the most effective and efficient way possible. However, due to my inability to write and communicate I figured less will be more as my main point in this post is to hear ideas and insights on ways to become a FedEx contractor. 

Would you pursue incorporated and then financing? Would you secure financing and then pursue incorporated? Starting as a new corporation is it more advantageous to purchase an existing route or continue to apply to become a new contractor?

16-04-27,4glx7v,Here is where to buy AAPL,"https://www.tradingview.com/x/YCl69juJ/

Entry points 93, 83, 75, 65, 55

Probability of it going to 55 without a run up is 3%. If you look at each entry as a potential rebound. 

How you should take this trade.

1) determine your max loss for the trade. let's say its $5000. 

2) Split it tiered over the those 5 entries to get an average closer to the median.

250$/97

250 / 93 = 5

750/ 83 = 9

1000/ 73 = 13

1250/65 = 19

1500/ 55 = 27

total commissions ($1 per trade)  is about 0.06 per share to buy.  


EDIT: You guys can quote me on this - I think a high probability reversal point will be between the 78-87 range and will have a likely rally to 93 to 95 ish. 6 to 20% return + 0.5% to 1% in dividends depending on your average price .

16-04-26,4gjraw,Questions about employer stock plan,"My company is starting up a new stock plan that will be available to employees in about a month or so and I wanted to run it by the geniuses here to see if it's something I should participate in and if so, how to best maximize the value.

For reference, I'm a US based employee working for a non-US company so there is a bit of Euro numbers thrown in.

* As an employee, I have the opportunity to contribut betwen 1% and 10% of my base salary each month to purchase shares of the company stock.
* The company will match 40% of my contribution and provide a 20 Euro subsidy.
* The company match and subsidy maxes out at 6,000 Euros per year.
* I can sell the shares at any time excluding blackout periods.

The provided some examples of how a change in the share price affects my investment, for example, if I invest 250 Euros:

* And the share price rises 15%, my before tax/SS profit will be 70%.
* And the share price rises 5%, my before tax/SS profit will be 55%.
* And the share price drops 20%, my before tax/ss profit will still be 18%. 

This sounds like a pretty sweet deal to me, but I want to make sure I'm not missing anything.

I'm also curious what the implications are of selling the stock as soon as I receive the 40% match and 20 Euro subsidy.  Are there any capital gains tax implications related to selling immediately vs. holding for two years?

Never-the-less, I do trade and I do make money, so I figured I’d write a little bit up on what I think might be applicable to you guys. That being said, I figured I’d turn this into a little AMA so that way I can specifically target the questions you guys have and not waste my time blathering on about stuff you guys don’t care about.

&amp;nbsp;

First things first, the disclaimer. What I trade for a living is 75% corn, 15% soybeans, and the other 10% is a mix of rice, wheat, and milo. These are driven significantly by fundamental events. I could write a book on valuing those commodities, but you guys don’t give a shit about that. What you guys do care about, I’m guessing, is the technical analysis used to supplement that fundamental analysis as that can be applied to equities. So that’s all I’ll cover here. On that note, I’m just going to scratch the surface, leaving very industry specific tidbits out and more in depth items such as VWAP (which I regularly employ and suggest learning at some point) on the sideline. Finally, I am only going to cover in depth ONE technical analysis indicator (Ichimoku Clouds). I’m choosing to cover that because it is the one I use 85% of the time and I RARELY see it mentioned here.

&amp;nbsp;

All that out of the way, let’s begin.

&amp;nbsp;

**1) Ichimoku Kinko Hyo** 
This is far and above my go to technical indicator. It will give you most everything you need with one glance; trend, support, resistance, etc. There are TONS of resources online about this indicator, so I’m not going to even bother butchering an explanation of the parts of the indicator. Those can be found in other resources online. I will just give examples of its use.
Things to know about the indicator (I know not all of these are FULLY correct, just trying to introduce people to the indicator however). 

* If the price is above the cloud, it’s an uptrend. If the price is above a GREEN cloud, that’s extra confirmation of an uptrend. The same applies to downtrends with red clouds. If the price is IN the cloud, it has no trend.
* The cloud is also used as support/resistance. 
* The Tenkan Sen line (blue) crossing the Kijun Sen (yellow) line is traded much like the MACD. Unlike the MACD, however, it’s plotted against current price and so can be used in conjunction with price movements.
* The lagging line (white) is excellent for confirmation. All it is is the current price shifted 26 periods back) If you see the price move above the cloud, but the lagging line is still below/in the cloud, it may indicate a false breakout. 

&amp;nbsp;

[See me run through an example using all the components above on this chart here. This is SPY using a random time period. If there are some specific example periods you would like to see, request them below.](http://i.imgur.com/H5shQrR.png)

&amp;nbsp;

Now, the above is a good example of trading trends with Ichimoku Clouds, however it does not actually show the full strategy. For that 2 additional items must be introduced, Pivot Points and Risk/Reward ratio.

&amp;nbsp;

**2) Pivot Points**
For this, I’m really not going to go into any detail at all. Basically, they are important price levels based on the previous periods High/Low/Close. [Here is a quick chart of QQQ from today showing the pivot points](http://i.imgur.com/COaYjt7.png) (noticed we hit R2 this morning and promptly bounced right off). They tend to act as support/resistance. Please do more research online if you feel the need. Tons of resources online. 

&amp;nbsp;

**3) Risk/Reward ratio**
I’m sure this is some sort of sin discussing this in this sub, but here it goes.
Establishing a positive RRR is, in my opinion, IMMENSLY important to being a long-term profitable trader. I’m running out of time so I’m not going to write a ton about it. Long story short, before entering a trade, establish your realistic upside and downside. Let’s use the Ichimoku chart from before for this. When I first would have entered the trade, the price was at about $186 or so. My stop loss would be set at around $181 or so (just below the bottom of the cloud, so -$5). I would likely use a combination of pivot points and historical resistance lines to establish an exit point to the upside. Regrettably, I do not have pivot points on this chart like I usually do on my work terminal. As such, for my example, I’m going to make up what R1 and R2 is. They are likely completely wrong, but I’m short on time. Let’s call R1 $189 and R2 $193.5. Let’s say I think R2 ($193.5) is very attainable because previous highs, other indicators, etc.  Using this as our exit, we would get a potential profit of $7.5 for our trade and a potential loss of $5. In other words, a RRR of 1.5:1. This is acceptable in my opinion and I would execute this trade. Changing sides let’s say, that I only thought R1 was attainable. This would result in a potential profit of $4 and loss of $5. This would be a RRR of less than 1:1 and I would very likely avoid this trade.
Really sorry this section was not very well written, I hope the concept gets across though.

&amp;nbsp;

My final point is how I typically trade personal equities. MOST of the money I make comes from timing various stocks using Ichimoku clouds as explained above. I rarely trade the stocks themselves, however, instead employing various options strategies, buying FOTM options when I think they are mispriced (that’s a whole other topic in-and-of-itself) and selling options when I think something like VOL is overexagerated. 

&amp;nbsp;

That’s pretty much all I’ve got to say. This was really just a quick train-of-thought kind of thing as I didn’t have a ton of time to dedicate to it. As such, I know it wasn’t entirely clear and might have been a little difficult to follow. If that’s the case, sorry.

&amp;nbsp;

PS: IN B4 all the “That’s not a YOLO faggot,” “Who gives a shit about the CME,” et al. Well, you’re both right and wrong. I was using traditional Risk/Reward ratios which for all of you would be considered very conservative. No one is stopping you, though, from seeing a breakout opportunity and deciding to just go “all-in.”
Hope this helped.
 
&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR: Ichimoku clouds kick ass. [See here for the pretty chart.](http://i.imgur.com/H5shQrR.png)  In addition, if you want to make money long-term and not just one-off YOLO's, begin using risk/reward ratios to actually make money. Any questions, let me know below.**

16-04-27,4gq0d5,Question about technical analysis vs fundamental when buying/trading stocks,"Hi r/stocks, 

I'm extremely new to stocks and had a question about technical analysis vs. fundamental analysis. In the world of stocks, are there those who view one much more important than the other or is it understood that both are equally important? Also, is there any type of tool that will (from a technical analysis) look at a company's history and give you a good idea if it's a good time to invest due to past trends? For example, if I wanted to put 10k into Boeing and wanted to know if now is the best time or should I wait 6 months?

16-04-26,4gk8h9,"[DEBT NEWS] $SUNE -- SunEdison DIP nets interim approval; final hearing on May 10","#SunEdison DIP nets interim approval; final hearing on May 10

---
^(via S&amp;P Capital IQ)


The bankruptcy court overseeing the Chapter 11 proceedings of SunEdison gave interim approval to the company’s proposed $300 million new-money DIP facility, clearing the way for the company to access up to $90 million, according to an April 26 order entered in the case.

A final hearing on the DIP was scheduled for May 10, the order shows.

The bankruptcy court held a hearing on interim approval of the DIP and other first-day motions on April 22.

At that hearing, Manhattan Bankruptcy Court Judge Stuart Bernstein held off on approving the company’s request to appoint an examiner in the case, ruling that creditors needed more time to organize and weigh in on the potential probe of the company, according to a report from Dow Jones’ Daily Bankruptcy Review.

Creditor groups that did object to the examiner appointment argued, among other things, that the company’s unusual request for an examiner in connection with first day motions was an effort to control and limit investigations into the company.
As for the DIP facility, according to court filings the facility would consist of $125 million of new-money term loans provided by certain of the company’s pre-petition first-lien lenders (tranche A loans) and $175 million of new-money term loans provided by certain members of an ad hoc group holding about 90% of the company’s aggregate second-lien debt (tranche B loans).
On an interim basis, $37.5 million would be provided by tranche A lenders, and $52.5 million by tranche B lenders.

The facility would also provide for a letter of credit facility designed to replace the company’s pre-petition first-lien facility on a rolling basis during the interim approval period and, upon final approval, to also replace any remaining letters of credit issued under the pre-petition facility.

In addition, upon final approval the DIP would also roll up outstanding loans and other borrowings under the pre-petition first-lien facility that resulted from drawings under letters of credit thereunder either prior to the Chapter 11 filing or during the period of interim DIP approval, and a roll-up of $350 million aggregate principal amount of the pre-petition second-lien obligations into tranche B roll-up loans.

Interest under the facility would be at L+900 for the new-money term loans, L+800 for any letter of credit borrowings, L+800 for the tranche A roll-up loans, and L+1,200 for the tranche B roll-up loans, with a 1% LIBOR floor in all instances.

Among other things, the term loans carry a 1.5% upfront fee.
As for milestone deadlines, the facility requires the company to file within 21 days of the Chapter 11 petition date (by May 12) a “motion to approve certain near-term assets sales in accordance with the [DIP facility] budget. The company and lenders are also to agree, within 25 days of the Chapter 11 petition date (by May 16), on a sale process for assets not identified in the near-term motion.

In addition, the milestones require the company to provide to the facility’s administrative agent and advisors for the tranche B lenders within 14 days (by May 5) a “comprehensive business plan, including asset-by-asset treatment, proposed asset sales and the plan for each business, platform, and project,” or, alternatively, a plan for the “controlled liquidation” of the company. Lenders must approve the business (or liquidation) plan within six days after delivery, equating to an outside date of May 11.

More traditionally, if the company meets those short-term milestones the DIP requires the filing of a reorganization plan and disclosure statement within 120 days (by Aug. 19), court approval of the disclosure statement within 50 days after that (equating to an outside date of Oct. 8), and confirmation of reorganization plan within 50 days after that (equating to an outside date of Nov. 27).

Deutsche Bank is the administrative agent under the facility. — Alan Zimmerman

This was a large beat in spite of currency headwinds as they are a very international company now. As a matter of fact, this was the first quarter where international revenues surpassed domestic. They are growing extremely rapidly in Europe and Asia (169 retail stores in China and triple digit growth).

The have very solid numbers. Their first quarter sales were $980 million which grew 27.4% from Q1 2015. This is impressive as their overall market cap is only 4.5 billion. They have a forward PE of 13.4 and an excellent PEG ratio of 0.79. 

My favorite thing about it is that many people write it off as a lame company/product which I think has allowed it to be undervalued. It's not as sexy as UA, but it's way more reasonably priced.

It seems that stocks start low when the market opens and have a mid-day low around 11am or noon and then increase. Or course, this is not a rule of thumb, but I am curious if its possible to use historic data to identify the average lowest-hour of any stock given if its in a buy/sell/hold state, and then use that average lowest-hour to buy/sell accordingly. If the likelihood of success is above 50% for either direction and if there is enough data to make the directionality significant.

I guess this would be more of a intra-day technical strategy. Are there others that do this?",2

16-04-27,4gqlnm,I posted a few days ago about selling a stock I bought at different prices. Everyone said I was wrong in caring about what prices I bought them at influencing my sale decisions. I sold the shares and would love to continue the discussion.,"The first discussion was here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/4gddbw/i_bought_stock_x_at_3_two_months_ago_i_buy_more/

I forgot to mention outright that I am trading in a TFSA (Canada) so tax considerations don't factor.

Also I didn't mention I wanted to sell as explained in the first post because I wanted to free up some capital to buy a penny stock I have a good feeling about but I also want to keep a stake in the original company. Had I just sold some of the shares without caring which ones (the ones bought at $2.50 or the ones bought at $3) that transaction would be a net loss.

I figured out how to sell the $2.50 yesterday at a small gain and used that to invest in that penny stock. Now the original share price was climbing back to around $3 today so I'm hoping it'll stay on that trajectory and sell the rest of it at a gain. 

I value the opinion and love the instruction I've received from this community which is why I'm posting about this. I want to understand how shares of one company bought at different times are fungible. I get that had I not sold the $2.50 shares until the price went back up to +$3 I'd gain more off them. Would the gain equal the same as what I did selling separately (guessing it'd be an even bigger gain when factoring fees)? Does my needing to free up capital make the situation different? 

Just having trouble understanding how some replies said this gain/loss difference that I made a profit from doesn't exist.  ",1

I am having an hard time finding the best place to do this be sure I am not getting ripped of by fees, management fees but above all buying (and selling) fees. My consultant (at ubs) told me etf are expensive for this strategy because of the minimum fees to buying, while their fund will be cheaper, since there is no minimum, you only pay a % of the investment. 

I am looking at vanguard etf which have considerably low management fees, but I don't understand what fees I would incur when buying, and if there is a minimum fee (which is what screw up dollar cost averaging with small investments).

Right now I am reminded of this scene from Apollo 13 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMj6us9BHNk) because I sit on the edge of a situation which could prove similarly catastrophic/jubilant.

Tomorrow is $LNKD's first earnings release since it shed 44% of its value overnight as a result of its last earnings release.

Before that earnings release I traded an iron condor.  And I traded a lot of it.  The only thing that couldn't happen was a 44% drop.

So every day for the past three months, my life has been primarily dedicated to trading out of that position.  I had no idea what I was doing the day I traded it or what I was doing when I immediately had to escape it.  I have been forced to become an impossibly better trader than I was that day and at this point I remain cautiously optimistic I have done the right things.

I'm not going to post proof of this.  If you read my history you'll see that I trade earnings ICs, and you can choose to believe or not.  

All you need to know is that my exposure is hundreds of thousands of dollars.  It is, objectively, the most YOLO situation I have seen anyone on this sub put themselves into. But it wasn't ever meant to be. And now everything is at risk.

I'm not going to tell you what I need LNKD to do tomorrow.  Because if it doesn't go my way I'm going to need to come back here and lie about how it went.  If this doesn't go my way, despite how much of a jackass I am around here I won't be able to bear the jokes on top of it. I'm mostly a jackass because, as noted, every day for three months everything I've built my life into has been at risk because of one trade.  

(but please, respond to this post with all the jokes and hate you got, I need something to relieve my tension)

To add to the amusement of this all, tomorrow happens to be an event I must attend and travel to so you won't hear any follow up from me tomorrow. You won't hear from me when LNKD posts earnings or trades after hours. I'm not even going to look at it until late tomorrow night because there's nothing to be done at this point. You won't hear from me Friday morning either because I'll surely have to very actively manage these positions.

I'll see you on the other side.",87

JBT also dabble with aerial transportation, I think this is a great risk as transportation is always effected by oil price (this is base on the performance of the air transport industry)

16-04-27,4godo8,"Millennials like unusual investments, not safe stock or ostentatious wealth displays.","There is a seemingly new trend in investing - fund things that are or were considered ludacris just a few years ago. And it seems to be coming from millenials. I feel quite dual about this idea actually. Millenials have grown up, and they tend to invest in quite non-conservative stuff like art and small businesses. On the one hand I can understand why would someone do this: it’s stylish, it’s unusual and it builds your social image (which is arguably more important for millennials than direct profits). Plus, even if the business you’ve trusted in fails, you still have something tangible left (like a piece of art, for example). Which is especially valuable considering how the millenials tend to invest based on emotional preferences. I get this part.  But, on the other hand… You can’t really call this “investing” in classical meaning of the word. Not when it’s carried out with no solid forecasts if this artist gains recognition or not, and reliyng on such an unpredictable market that has little to no regulation and organization. 

So yeah, the way I see it, this is no usual investment, and it’s certainly not for everyone. But with that said I get why it’s appealing to younger and more risk tolerant generation. What do you guys think about it? Is it a quirk of the youth, or does it have the opportunity to become a new standart in the years to come?

Microsoft's purchase of the franchise is only now going to truly begin reaping the rewards and earnings are about to shoot up after the 2.5 billion dollar purchase a while back that unnerved weary investors.

Microsoft is cheap.

I'm looking to dump this stock sometime in June and take everything and put it in some kind of marijuana stock.

Ideally I'm not looking for a pink sheet and I'm looking for something with a fair amount of volume.

Hey Folks,

I'm back with an update on the oil trade.  Yesterday I closed out the remaining calls I had open as there was only 10c left in time premium.  I wrote new August calls at $11 for .91 cents.  With a cost basis of $10,850 at the time of writing, this gives me 8.3% return over the next 4 months.  I will probably close these in the final month again if the time premium gets too low.

Finally, you may be wondering why my original investment was $17,000 and now it is, $12,000 - well I had something unexpected happen and had to move the money around.  Anyways, that should be the last surprise and the experiment can continue!

Without any more delay, the performance from my account statement: http://imgur.com/lXSIxOj

So, pros:
USO did well, actually better than I expected.  I lost money on the call but made money on the underlying, and am now able to write a new call with a large time premium at a better price than my base.  The volatility has been lowish, as the counter balanced trade keeps things relatively in check.

Cons: The overall market has done well in the same time period (see linked image), so if there is a retraction time will tell if USO will correlate or not and if the gains I saw are due to general market movement and nothing really changing with oil.

Overall I am happy with the trade and still believe oil is undervalued.  I did not do an analysis this time on the relationship between USO and WTI (crude oil), but may do so later this week when I have time, to see how much contango has been a factor.  And as I said before I will continue to do this until oil comes back to the land of reason, somewhere north of $50/barrel.",4

(Please check my other posts for past trades trading)

I'll be playing FB and FSLR to the downside today. Both report after the close. 

Both beat expectations last earnings but quickly touched highs and got rejected and have been hanging around the same price levels. With AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, and NFLX all taking a hit from their reports I can only assume FB will follow fate. Even if they meet or somehow beat expectations the price rejections from last report/stagnation followed- proves to me there isn't much hope for it to move higher right now. 

Then again, it's all ODDS! So who really gives a fuck what I think. Been on my longest streak in a long time. 3 weeks with no losers out of 62 trades. Maybe FB will burst my bubble. 

Remember you can buy 3-6 strikes away to define risk and not have your profits eaten up. 

( for those of you new to options. This is an IV collapse trade)

EDIT: Looks good. FSLR worked perfectly. My FB calls are 117 should be a wash. Also sold PYPL puts before close. Good day overall. Hopefully FB pulls back before the opening tomorrow. ",4

16-04-28,4gt93q,Dan Loeb / Third Point love Danaher. $DHL. Agree?,"From Third Point's 1Q investor [letter](http://www.thirdpointpublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Third-Point-Q1-Investor-Letter-TPOI.pdf)

Emphasis is mine.

***
[Danaher](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/dhr) is a diversified multi-industrial company with an increasing exposure to **life science and healthcare**-oriented businesses. Operating across five different business segments and built up through over 400 acquisitions over the company’s history, the cornerstone for Danaher’s successful integration and value creation strategy has been the Danaher Business System (DBS). Adapted from Japanese principles of kaizen, DBS has evolved into a set of processes and *corporate culture revolving around continuous improvement, helping to drive organic growth and annual margin improvement* across Danaher’s portfolio.

In May 2015, Danaher announced the acquisition of a filtration industry leader, Pall Corp, as well as the subsequent *split of Danaher into two companies*. The split, to be effectuated Q3 2016, will highlight value at both New Danaher – a collection of Danaher’s life science, medical and lower cyclicality businesses – and the spin-off, Fortive – an industrial focused “mini-Danaher”.

New Danaher, representing the large majority of post-split value, will have 60% consumables sales mix, 4% organic growth, 100bps of annual margin expansion, and 100% FCF conversion, an algorithm that will continue the Danaher tradition of compounded earnings growth. The attractive end-market mix, earnings growth, and deep bench of DBS operators will make New Danaher a premium life sciences company that should trade at the high end of its peer group.

Fortive, akin to what Danaher originally looked like two decades ago, will have greatly increased M&amp;A optionality and the ability to deploy free cash flow into assets which have historically received less focus within the Danaher portfolio. With the same DBS roots and team of disciplined operators, Fortive will also provide a multi-year compounding opportunity.

We initiated a position following the announcements last summer which mark a transformational step in Danaher’s decade-long efforts to continuously improve its portfolio of businesses. Despite Danaher’s portfolio of businesses looking more attractive than ever, **its current valuation premium to the S&amp;P 500 is modest and remains well below its ten year historical average premium. Over the last ten years, Danaher has compounded at 2x the rate of the S&amp;P 500**. We recently added to the position after a meeting with the company reinforced our confidence not only in their operations but also in the company’s culture and importance of their values and principles in driving future success.",1

* How old are you?
* Are you employed/making income? How much?
* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)
* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)
* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
* Any big debts?
* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.

16-04-28,4gty7f,WOW BIOELECTRONICS CORP. STOCK SYMBOL(BIEL) MAKE PRESS AGAIN,"Highlighted in UK's Express Newspaper on Dangers of Excessive Drug Use
[28-April-2016]

FREDERICK, Md., April 28, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- BioElectronics Corporation (OTC Pink: BIEL), the maker of advanced nonprescription $30.00 neuromodulation pain management medical devices, announces that its drug-free ActiPatch® product was noted in the United Kingdom's Express Newspaper Health Section, http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/664330/arthritis-pain-pills-warning-sufferers-taking-too-many-drugs-fight-agony. The paper has a circulation of 400,000 that will increase the awareness of ActiPatch therapy for arthritis and chronic pain.
The article entitled ""Arthritis pain pills warning: Sufferers taking too many drugs to fight agony"" describes the recent Arthritis Research UK/Daily Telegraph survey reveals the severe impact of pain and excessive drug use among the 8.5 million Britons now suffering from arthritis. The Arthritis Research UK survey showed the following:
Fewer than half (46%) feel satisfied with the current pain treatment they are receiving from their GP or healthcare professional.
The vast majority (76%) say the pain prevents them from living life to the full.
A huge number (80%) say their mobility is affected.
More than three in five (64%) report problems sleeping because of pain.
The article notes ActiPatch's drug-free mechanism of action and its effectiveness in reducing pain, which improves quality life with less dependence on strong painkillers.
ActiPatch is clinically proven treatment for osteoarthritis as demonstrated in an independently conducted double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, which was published in the peer, reviewed journal Rheumatology (www.rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org). There was a reported statistically significant reduction in pain and a significant improvement in the WOMAC² index. In addition, patients in the treatment group reported a statistically significant reduction in NSAID compared to the placebo group.

16-04-29,4gzgmh,"Let's take a look at a fair value for Apple.","In 2015 Apple produced ~70B in FCF. 

In the last 3 years, their average FCF is 55B. 

The first two quarters of this new financial year has seen their FCF fall 30% from 2015 but that's expected as it's compared against a 6 cycle which is generally higher.

To be conservative and guard against falling phone sales, my starting FCF in my DCF analysis here is 20% below their average of their last 3 years or 44B(63% of their 2015 FCF). To be further conservative, I'll assume a 0% growth rate off that number. To be further conservative, I took a 30% cut to their cash position to account for the fact that most of it is held overseas. 

If I assume a 7.6% discount rate(5% ERP, 2.6% treasury rate), I get a fair value of $129.82. I like a 30% safety net(further conservatism) which means a fair purchase price of $90.88. 

So now the question is - are my assumptions here too aggressive anywhere? Is 63% below their max FCF in 2016 and 20% below their average of the last 3 years too high as a starting point? 

Is a 0% growth rate going forward from that number unreasonable? 

I don't think it is but welcome any conversation here. I think we're at a point where Apple is a great value now. Yes their amazing growth is probably not going to be repeated in the near term but we've got a non S cycle upgrade soon which generally does better so I expect growth y/y next year after a slow year this year which probably makes my estimate here a bit conservative in the near term but potentially valid in the long term.

16-04-28,4gu909,Broker comparison,"Hello,
I'm researching different brokers and have a couple of questions about what some of the charges they mention means and also if the conclusions I’m drawing are correct.
 
Background : NON-US citizen looking to passively invest in US, EU, Global ETF's.
 
I've looked in some detail at DBS, TD Direct, Saxo and IB.
 
DBS
+ no annual fee
+ good commission costs (16EUR) for under &lt; 32,000EUR
- Dividend collection quarterly of 1%
- No online access to EUR markets
qu : They list a clearing fee of 0.0325%. What is this?
Conclusion : Access to German market is a deal breaker. The rest looks good
 
TD Direct
-  Account Fee - EUR 45 (if no trades in a qtr)
- - qu : Is this every Qtr?
+ Good Commission costs US/Canada/UK - EUR 14.95, EU - EUR 29.95
+ Access to international markets
- Additional Maintenance Fee - EUR 25
- Add Exchange Fees - UK - 0.5%
- Transfer of securities to another institution - EUR 25 per position – Qu : what does it mean ‘per position’?
Conclusion : Too many fixed fees
 
Saxo
- High account minimums $10,000
- not easy to see charges/fees on the site. Could not find info on annual fee
+ Access to international markets
+ Commissions look ok
- $100 inactivity fee every 6 months
- Transfer out fee max 160 EUR (did not find this at 1st glance on the other companies but I assume they have them)
Conclusion : High barrier for entry and not transparent enough for my liking
 
IB
- High account minimums ($10,000 )
- Maintenance fee for inactivity ($10/month)
+ Commissions look ok (US minimum fund is $3000)
- $20 monthly cost (therefore $240 annual cost)
Conclusions : Regular fees look expensive for passive trading (monthly : $20 + $10)",2

16-04-29,4gwxqx,How does the popular opinion now compare with that in 2000 or 2007?,"I'd just like to get the input of some old hands here. How similar is the rhetoric in the media now to what was seen in 2007 or 2001? 
It seems a lot of people are guessing that employment numbers are probably being manipulated and that they are maybe the only thing that shows any positive outlook currently. As I see the US stock market is being held up by buybacks and people not wanting to bet against the Fed. The government and media are saying one thing, but my online sources are saying another. I see a depression coming, one by one things are stacking up, most of the good news is artificial. What worries me is that this is common knowledge. 
Many people are talking about it and being on the side of the majority is not usually the most profitable side to be on. I'm saving really well right now but in about five years I won't be so I'm positioning myself to try to take advantage of this turmoil and then let it ride more or less into the next ten years. I have only been investing for about six months. I'd really like to know how aware the average trader/investor was of the conditions that led to the previous two recessions. Was there a similar imbalance of arguments on the negative side then or was it more nuanced? 
I follow market news on seekingalpha, maybe I'm a victim of confirmation bias, or maybe the site is biased. Any thoughts? As far as I can tell, in the previous two recessions the opportunity cost of getting out early and missing more upsides was maybe something that kept people in the market, or was it ignorance.

16-04-29,4gzn11,Annual Operating Expenses too much for my 401k?,"I have been given the option to build my own 401k by my new company instead of going with there generic build. I am 27 and own a home. I wont be in the home for more than 7 years so i'm opting out of putting the bond money into mortgage and going with a 90/10 split stocks/bonds. I have settled on allocating my assets as such- 50% large Cap, 25% small/mid, 15% international stocks, and 10% bonds. 


My question is how much is too much to pay in annual fees? as it stands the Large Cap fee is 1.3% per $1000, small/mid is .85%, International is 1.1%, and Bonds are .85%. all based on Per $1000. I chose 20K as a point to calculate from and found that if all assets were to perform in the same manner (i understand this wont happen but for calculations sake), then at 20K I would be paying $227.50 in Annual Operating Expenses. 


My company will put in 4% if i put in 5% (which im going to do). It would take me about a paycheck and a half to cover the $227.50.


I've never built my own plan before so I want to make sure i'm not over paying with the way I have the assets allocated.

But there are two sides to every trade right? If I buy a stock for $30, my $30 enters the market and somebody else gets $30 for his bank account that used to be in stocks. If I sell it's just a buy for someone else. IPO's might be a different story, but that isn't most of the action.  It's a zero sum game (another phrase he used a lot in the lecture actually).

Only thing I can figure is that if I pay you $30 for a stock, hopefully at some point you paid somebody less for it.  Maybe in that sense and only in that sense (aside from new stock issues) does money enter the market.",6

16-04-28,4gwnbb,Am I valuing companies correctly?,"I have been investing a little over a year and have been reading profusely (F Wall Street, One Up on Wall St, Warren Buffett and the Interpretation of Financial Statements, The Outsiders: 8 Unconventional CEOs, currently reading Pat Dorsey's 5 Rules to Successful Stock Investing and have glanced at the Little Book that Beats the Market). Essentially, I am building an idea of what wonderful companies look like (i.e., my screens are FCF/Sales(or Revenue) &gt; 5%, ROA (10 year) &gt; 5%, ROE (10 year) &gt; 15%, net margin&gt;15%).

The problem is that according to my DCF models (the one provided by F Wall St (FCF based) and I use the ones provided by gurufocus  (FCF and Earnings based) everything is overvalued. I can only buy say KO or MSFT at 30 or Visa at 40 which essentially means either the stock market is wildly overvalued or perhaps I am valuing companies incorrectly (I will say my discount rate is probably high at 12% and have considered taking it down to 9-10). Also, I see  people say all the time MSFT would be a great buy in mid-low 40s or that DHR was a great buy at 80 (which I passed on because my DCFs said it was fairly valued). This has led me to wonder whether companies with moats command a premium.


Oh for the F Wall St DCF model, you assume the company will grow FCF at the growth rate (diminished  by 95% for every year for 10 years then a terminal growth rate of 4%). You take the Free Cash generated each year, discount them to present value, and sum it up. Take the FCF sum and add it to shareholder's equity and divide by outstanding shares. I use 25% margin of safety for large-cap, 50% for mid-cap, 75% for small cap.

16-04-28,4gwqw6,Question about sector ETFs.,"I'm used to trading stocks and occasionally the S&amp;P Eminis, and recently I have become interested in the SPDR sector ETFs as a way of investing in individual sectors. 

However, they hardly seem to move enough to be worth trading. A lot of them are quite high priced, and yet have tiny, *tiny* daily ranges and percentage movements. Any individual stocks from those sectors seem to move much more, at least a percent or two per day, enough to trade, while the ETFs just sit there. And yet, when I talked to Ameritrade they said the SPDR ETFs take just as much margin as a  regular stock, fifty percent. Are there any other options for sector investing?

The leveraged ETFs are apparently useless, as from what I can see they move on a percentage basis, so if you hold them for a few days you can lose money even though the sector went up. There are (or were at one time) eminis on the S&amp;P sectors, but I can't seem to find a quote for those anywhere, and even if they do trade anymore it looks like it must be very thinly.

I have been short 150 shares UWTI  for the past 2 month and down $900. It seems like every day oil goes up with no end in sight. It just insane how it always go up . At some point it has to fall.  

Just amazing everyone suddenly  goes from 'too much oil' to 'not enough'; 

I imagine in the worst case oil goes to $64 (a gain of 33%) and then UWTI rises approx 100%. Oil, unlike a stock can;t, just rise to infinity 

Another idea I'm contemplating is buying deep in the money Jan 2018 UCO puts (630 days out) . If the contango and beta decay for UCO is around  5% a month, the total decay will be: .95^(53 months)=$1 price target for UCO assuming oil just stays range-bound for the next two years. Seems too good to be true though.

This may be a short play for people interested in anywhere between 300-500%. Last night, just before close, someone picked up a huge volume of shares. Total trading spiked to 72 million. Right at the beginning of the month LEAS also saw some epic buy-ins with volumes running into the 90 million range. This led to a spike that peaked at 600% considering the timing and the sheer size of this one buy, I strongly suspect we will see a spike in the next 2 days.

It seems S&amp;P is from my opinion too high, the earnings ratio from the companies and GDP growth ain't just matching to the current valuation levels for stocks. Interest rates just doesn't make sense either for the current market without creating bubble and wealth gap.

I'll eventually post the full details of this saga because I promise it's wild and full of lessons but for those of you that speculated about my original iron condor - yes it traded past something I was trying to make a small profit on with big risk but the bigger issue was that the resulting margin call was liquidated in a way that left me with enormous naked option positions to trade out of.  I was dumb taking the initial risk in terms of how much I stood to lose if the stock went black swan like it did but it was the fact that that initial risk immediately got turned into (at one point) millions of dollars of risk in naked options on a margin call that made this something beyond all expectations.

Pros:

- steady positive growth

- heavy recent insider buying (march 11-24)

- upward trend since late feb/early march


Cons:

- President stepping down for CEO offer at another bio tech company

- Zika Virus continues to spread, may hurt future growth

- Though no recent valuations, analysts' mean target price $8.40 (below current trading price)

- Significant decline recently (-23.5% since 4/25/2016)

The recent congressional hearing coupled with today's 10-K has made me change my outlook, at least until the incoming CEO/board are able to stabilize the business model.

Bill Ackman's dialogue with the committee has made it quite apparent that Valeant will be forced to lower its prices on several drugs that are key to earnings. This would be fine by itself, however when you couple it with the debt profile from the most recent 10-K:

* 2016: 3,524M
* 17/18: 7,348.9M
* 19/20: 12,920.2
* After 2020: 19,183.0

Previous quarterly filings did not disclose this level of debt due in early years. 

It appears that Valeant's success as a company is dependent upon it operating without pricing decreases, and it looks like price decreaes virtual certainty at this point.

With that all said, the company does have another 10 products launching in 2016/17, are breaking into a number of new emerging markets, and there might be new revenue opportunities that I am not taking into account. So in that sense, if the CEO is able to come in and stabilize things, perhaps there is a way out of this mess; but in the short-term, I am closing my long positions and seeing how things play out, as the road to recovery will be long term, and there will be plenty of time to ride the share prices up (if it occurs).

Just my two cents.

I'm a young guy who started paper-trading on Trade Hero for 6 months, I did really well so I've decided to slowly, carefully tiptoe into the real thing and registered with TradeKing.  I know that success in a stock game definitely does NOT equal success in real-life so of course I am being extremely careful.

I've been lurking on this forum and other related forums for about 6 months now and have learned SO MUCH from you guys.  I know most people won't care but I decided to finally make a post here and reveal my first stock purchase ever: PRXL@$60.59

It was going down FAST and although I didn't plan on making this my first stock purchase, I felt I had to take advantage of the free fall. Plan on selling almost all my shares once it gets to $70 or $75.

My question is - do any brokers allow its users to buy/sell these spreads on one single order? 

My current broker (Scottrade) doesn't appear to have this feature (please correct me if I'm wrong), so I would have to place both a ""buy to open"" call order at the higher strike price and ""sell to open"" call order at the lower strike price. This obviously wouldn't be as good as doing some sort of combination order due to the commissions and possibility of price changing between the times that I place my separate orders.

I took a position in DUST last Friday at 1.89 and a slightly larger position in NUGT on Tuesday at $83.18, given my view that Yellen's blabbing would be positive for the shiny rocks. DUST's 5% run through Tuesday provided an added cushion in what I was ultimately using as a hedge. Granny talks, thesis confirmed, DUST sold for a modest .05% return amidst swings on its way down while my $100 sell limit on NUGT triggered today. 4 days, 20%, and the comfort of having a profitable trade for either outcome of the rate forecast. The inverse correlation of these instruments break down when they become overly volatile. This allowed multiple chances to ditch the loser at a higher-than-should-be price and ride the winner once volatility settled and a trend emerged.

16-04-29,4h0vyz,Recent grad and want to start investing for the first time. Any suggestions?,"I'm a recent graduate and I want to start investing, but I don't have a lot of assets and I'm not so knowledgeable about investing at this point: A few facts about me:

- early 20s
- income about 60k
- $10,000 emergency fund in a 1% savings account
- $23,000 student loan debt (average interest rate &lt; 4% - all government loans)
- Contributing 4% to a Vanguard 2055 target date retirement fund for 401k (getting full employer match (50% up to 4%)

I've been contributing about $1000 a month to my emergency fund, but now that I've hit $10,000 (my goal), I've been considering what to do next:

- Split my $1000 monthly savings into: $500 a month to pay down loans on top of the minimum (targeting highest interest loans first) $500 into a Betterment account each month until I hit $10,000 and move to Vanguard ETFs
- Increase my contribution to the Vanguard target date fund (401k)
- Invest the $10,000 emergency fund into the a low-cost Vanguard admiral's fund (ETF or index fund?) and then start re-building the emergency fund (until it hits $10,000 again, etc)

I'm slightly hesitant to increase my contribution to the 401k, in spite of the tax advantages. There might come a time I want to make a downpayment on a house or a car 10/20 years from now (no plans to do so right now) and the 401k/IRA is not going to help with that.

Likewise, I could double-down and put all my extra savings to paying off student debt, but some suggest that I would actually be losing out on returns since my weighted interest rate on student debt is less than 4%. Not to mention, once the money to used to pay loans, it's gone forever (can't be used in a crisis).

Do any of you have some suggestions as to what I should do next? This is the first time in my life I've had the chance to consider investing, so I'm not so knowledgeable. I've been trying to research as much as possible and the options above are what I've come up with as the most reasonable.

16-04-29,4h0y13,Trying to understand...,"Ok, back in the winter we had a discussion regarding the attachment that people have to holding on to stocks  as opposed to selling them at a loss.  I forgot the name of the ""syndrome"" but I found it interesting.  Nevertheless, the point that was made:  Sell the stock at a loss invest in something else that will gain back your money.  That's paraphrasing I know but the gist.  However;  I am unable to grasp the concept of how you are gaining back your money if you sold at a loss.  So, If I sold shares of let's say AAPL at a loss of $500.  How then would investing in something else  help to regain the loss?  I'm visual so I can't really grasp the concept.  Thanks. ",1

16-04-29,4gy28k,Question about Stocks vs Student Loans,"So I have students loans right now amounting to $14k, $10k of which is subsidized while the rest is not. Since the interest on those loans is roughly 5% across the board (a little less actually), would it be a better decision to actually invest the money I would be paying these loans off with? I say this because I recently saw Bill Ackman's everything* about investing and saw him suggest to pay off loans first, but these loans arent very expensive at all. The only part that makes me question is how much research would it take to beat 5% interest from the loans. (They also aren't due until the end of 2019 btw).",4

16-04-29,4gy39q,$FLML,"Otherwise know as Fuck (lol) my life

just kid

flamel technologies has this kind of cheesy way of doing business. They look for old, unapproved drugs that are being ""illegally"" sold in the US as approved drugs. Surprise, there is actually a handful of them.

After some digging, what I believe is going on is FLML has bought the rights to ephedrine sulfate from éclat pharmaceuticals.

Saturday they have a meeting with the FDA to get approval, which would then grant them &gt;1 year exclusivity for the drug, which is about 70-80 million/year. 

Why it currently is being ""illegally"" sold to hospitals and stuff is that there is this very weak idea that drugs can be ""grandfathered in"" - that is if they were around before 1938 or 1920, they don't need FDA approval *if nothing including formulation, dose, delivery, or labeling has changed*. 

The FDA comments on this as: ""We don't believe that any drug can rightly be grandfathered in, however we don't believe it impossible, either"".

So on saturday, what is going to happen is the FDA will say hey chaps @ FLML, you did it, you came to us, like good boys, and checked out all the safety and efficacy of historical data, and we do agree that it is both safe and effective and that labeling is correct. You can now market the drug legally. We will take a few months, and then we'll knock on Akorn Pharmacetical's door and tell them they need to stop *fucking* selling illegal ephedrine sulfate injections or we'll ban them forever.

So, there are two ways to play this:

PUTS on Akorn (AKRX) or Calls/equity on FLML.

I haven't currently decided if I'm going to play this, considering all my risk taking has completely obliterated my account, but I'd like to offer you all the opportunity.

I don't think the upside is a bagger, I'm seeing more like 15-20% equity raise, but I've done no financial modelling or otherwise.

Currently the FLML is riding pretty nicely on a bullish trend, I don't expect this to continue after this week for very long, I think a good proportion of the approval is priced in already, but not all of it.

Some analysts were pretty fucking bullish in January - screaming the stock price is $20, while crying at their spread sheets.

GOOD LUCK!",17

16-04-29,4h10n8,Seeking advice on Investing my $5000 HSA,"Hello!

I'm a (currently) healthy happy married 24yo with an Optim HSA that I would like to get the most out of. I havnt invested any of it until this point and would like to finally take a stab at it. I can swing $5000 into the investment portion and still feel comfortable. 

Here are the options minus what funds were listed as closed. 

http://imgur.com/Tt7ybi7

I wanted to get your insight and thoughts on what I should target. I would probably peg my risk tolerance in the moderate range. I'm fine with seeing short term losses, I just don't want to put everything on black and hope for the best. I do not have an overall portfolio to balance against. My other major investment asset is ~$10,000 locked up in a 401k provider change at work right now. I plan on pulling that info together in the coming weeks too to balance this out. 

My instinct say to go with 2k in VEXAX and the minimum 3k into VSMGX to have a semblance of balance and to make the most of the low expense ratios that are available to me. 

What would you do? What other information should I add to my little spreadsheet from the available data on the prospectus/Morningstar.

16-04-29,4h119t,Problem with Equity Crowdfunding and Small Companies,"Hi, guys! I want to share with you a topic that has recently caught my attention. Namely, how the Tax Law limits S-corporation to use equity crowdfunding. As far as I know S-corporations allow to use the limited liability of corporate shareholders but to pay income taxes as if you were the sole owner. All the profits in S-corp. go to the owners who pay personal income tax. However, some problems arise when it comes to the equity crowdfunding and small companies. The crowdfunding became legal May 16, 2012; I mean the JOBS Act was created. It limits the activity of S-corporations. The main requirement is that the company can’t have more than 100 shareholders. Nevertheless, The Act also contains an exception, namely Regulation A which was created June 19, 2015. Regulation A allows raising the amount of capital to $50 million. But the main obstacle is that S-Corporations must have less than 100 shareholders, so if the company plans to raise a large sum of money, they can quickly get the potential for double taxation and lose the authority of S-corporation. So, what to do? Do S-corporations really miss this opportunity to raise capital? What do you think, guys, is it real to get rid of such limitations or S-corporations just should become double-taxed? I look forward to your decisions.",1

16-04-30,4h55wq,Why does Short Ratio represent the number of days it takes for short covering?,"I found this information on Wikipedia:
[quote]
The ratio is calculated by dividing the number of shares sold short by the average daily trading volume, generally over the last 30 trading days. **The ratio represents the number of days it takes short sellers on average to repurchase all the borrowed shares. **[end quote]

I can understand the definition and how the Ratio is calculated. But what baffles me is the use of it. How come the Ratio represents the days for short covering? First of all, it is definitely not a precise number, which I can understand. Is there really any correlation between the number of days for short covering and the Ratio?

16-04-29,4h198s,VXX options cheaper than VIX options,"I understand the basic differences. My questions is, what is a better value when taking into consideration spread, liquidity and IV.

VXX tracks 1 month (25 to 37 days) forward VIX futures, which have about a .5 beta to the VIX index. So by my shitty thinking, 1 VXX option should cost around half 1 VIX option. 

Just a minute ago I bought 2 VIX May24 atm Calls at 2.80x2 = $560. I also bought 5 VXX May20 atm calls at 1.18x5 = $590

If VXX truly .5 betas the VIX Index, then the VIX options are more expensive (especially when considering the .40 VIX spreads vs .02 VXX spread). If I'm wrong hopefully someone can school me.

16-04-30,4h5dyw,"What's /r/investing's take on dividend investing vs Indexing?","I've always been a dividend investor.  I've picked up a few growth stocks such as AMZN over the years, but for the overwhelming majority of the time, I've stuck with dividend companies.  More specifically, I've mostly stuck with companies that have increased their dividend payouts every year, without fail.

I've never been interested in Boglehead investing strategy, but I've come to wonder whether or not my portfolio could be doing better, since Indexing is a MUCH more prevalent strategy on these boards.

I'd like to hear from people on that side of the fence.  Why do you choose Indexing, and how do you think it fares against direct investing in companies themselves? 

For reference, a few of the better performers in my portfolio are as follows.

* PEP
* KO
* GWW
* MKC
* JNJ

You'll notice that these are not only *very* big name companies, but can be found on almost any dividend investor's recommendation list.  I'm the first to admit my strategy isn't flashy or impressive... But it's worked for me.

I'd just like to know how it stands up against Indexing. 

Edit: the MCK symbol was intended to be MKC.   I have no idea who McKesson is. 

EDIT:  People, I asked for your opinions regarding indexing vs direct dividend investing.  I'm NOT interested in being insulted or talked-down-to just because my strategy doesn't align with yours.

16-04-29,4h22kn,Half Million Found Proof Of Window Dressing At Valeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:VRX) - HalfMillion.com,"Link: http://halfmillion.com/valeant2/

TL;DR:

One of VRX's drugs (ezogabine/retigabine - Trobalt) was really profitable until further research and further risks canned the drug- ""This resulted in a ruling by regulators that Trobalt should only be prescribed if all other epilepsy medication had failed to produce results – implying that sales would fall dramatically.""  

This drug was worth $556 million. VRX hid the loss through deceptive accounting practices in 2013. This error continues onto the just filed 10K. This is one reason why VRX's earnings are so low compared to expected.  

I just picked up VRX and now I'm considering dropping it over this error. However, I do believe strongly in Ackman and Papa. Ackman's fund of course also got burned with this accounting error so long term I am of strong belief that they will right it going forward.  

In the mean time it means VRX should be valued at $560m less everything else being equal. Right now as of today's close they are valued at $11,449 M. This correction means VRX should be valued at $10,889M for a share price of $31.73/share.

16-04-29,4gyvqa,Possible to make 1% p/d?,"Hi there

I started learning about the markets in 2010 and had spells of day trading (whilst working full time). It had mixed success but it was fair to say that I never had an edge in my strategy. Afte a while, I laid off as I did'nt want to burn through hard earned cash.

I'm almost 40, been paying 2 sets of bills (folks too) since I was 21. I realise (very late!) that i'm going to be in trouble as I get older as I've not given myself a chance to be financially independent. Now I've managed to take of bills, got a better paying job and been more disciplined with my saving. I have an OK amount (by UK standards) but it's nowhere near enough to even get property.

So, I want to ask experienced financial gurus on here. Is it realistic for an average joe to make 1% per day (I obviously assume there's a lot of effort involved!)

Using this formula - ((P*(1+i)^n) - P)

where P=principle, i=interest &amp; n=periods(days in my case), a start point of £5000 over 200 days would result in £31580

Firstly, is that correct? Secondly, is this even achievable? Lastly, if not, what is realistic?

16-04-29,4gyzxd,DD on AEO (American Eagle) as requested by some nerd,"Here's DD on American Eagle. Feel free to add or call me fagiet.

Basic Info: 

Current Price: 14.60
52 Week range: 12.78 - 18.49
Earnings Date:	May 18 - May 23 (Est.)
P/E (ttm):	14.46

**Short % of Float (as of Mar 31, 2016): 21.90%**

About 10% of stocks held by insiders, no major recent insider trading.

[Using this site](http://apps.indigotools.com/IR/IAC/?Ticker=AEO&amp;Exchange=NYSE) I'm looking at total net revenue and profit. Last quarter they majorly increased overall revenue and profit, and we saw the price rise from $15 to $16, before riding up and down over a year. (Looking at those price fluctuations makes me want to short term trade, but here we'll just talk about earnings.)

They're closing stores to tighten up expenses, and opening new stores in places like baharain.

So in short I was getting excited about some puts coming into the money, but now I'm not so sure. While short interest is high, and firms are downgrading (goldman recommended buying puts in it's bait and hook newsletter) I think they might have a strong outlook.

current strat is puts up until earnings, and then straddle.

16-04-30,4h604e,How can I make a portfolio that invests in these certain future macro trends?,"My partner and I are both young, have solid careers, have finished paying off student loans, and will never have children. We'd like to begin investing our disposable income. We are risk tolerant, and we would like the chance to outperform the historical return rates of commonly suggested index funds by betting on potential paradigm shifts in the world economy. We will also invest actively - dedicating time to regular research and management of our portfolio. Hopefully this allows us to capitalize on trends and minimize losses in the event of the economy evolving in directions that are contradictory to our investments. 

None of these ideas are at all original - but in some cases the markets don't exist or there are very limited players. Can anyone suggest investments we could research given the following beliefs: 

**1. Self-driving vehicles will revolutionize world transportation.**

The shift will be dramatic here and it's potentially closer to happening than most people believe. There's plenty to digest on TSLA and their wild valuation but who are the other players? Who are the strongest in the components and software business? Are there actively managed funds in this space? 

**2. Earth's weather will become increasingly volatile and extreme due to global warming. Water will become an incredibly valuable commodity. Even though extreme flooding events will be as common as extreme drought events, humans do a poor job at capturing and storing water during times of surplus.**

Are there water commodities bonds that can be invested in? I see several public water utilities traded on the exchanges (MSEX, AWK, ARTNA), but I feel like that that's not the appropriate play for investing in the future of water. 

**3. Private space exploration/tourism/resource extraction will be a major catalyst for future world economic growth.**

Are there any speculative bets here? 

Thank you for any of your time. 

**edit: my title should read ""potential"" future macro trends**

16-04-30,4h2a15,"NYSE:SSE Stock Price amidst Chapter 11, trying to understand","I initially bought this stock when it was over $230 per share, 2 years later it has shrunk over 99.9%; the corporation is tied to the energy sector, namely oil and fracking exploration services and equipment. As of today the stock price is $0.19 per share. At the moment my only interest here is curiosity. 

The company is filing for chapter 11 which will happen on May 26th (and has been announced) and is going through a ""restructuring."" They have notified their employees that ""The existing shares of stock employees may hold in their 401K accounts will be cancelled and no
longer have value."" From what I understand there ""might"" be some type of share trading between the new issue of common stock and the old.

I keep seeing Market reports coming out ""Out of 4 analysts covering Seventy Seven Energy Inc (NYSE:SSE), 1 rate it a “Buy”, 0 “Sell”, while 3 “Hold”. This means 25% are positive."" 

So this leaves me with a few questions:

Who exactly are these analysts and why would they suggest a buy on this?

Is it possible there would be a trade-in between the old common stock and new issues of common stock? Is that typical or unlikely?

Why are the CEO and upper management buying back some of this stock in small quantities?  SEC insider transactions indicate the nature is ""401(k) Plan"", only a few thousand shares at a time, and at roughly 3x the listed price on the exchange.

Why don't they announce to investors the stock is going to be worthless? (There was a letter for investors posted on their website a few days ago claiming they couldn't really give investors any information regarding this.)",2

16-04-30,4h2c01,"Earnings week, what worked what didn't and what to do next.","Here are the plays I made this earnings week.

1. NFLX 1 Apr 22 credit call spread 110/113 for $1.33- I was pretty confident about NFLX going down, I didn't buy the fact that they have increased there users. Also the fact that they are producing more shows isn't exactly improving there bottom-line.  

P/L: $133

2. Sold GOOGL 1 Apr 22 IC 720/725/825/830 for $1.34- 1.5SD iron condor, delta neutral position. Got a little bit scared post earnings release as they missed expectations and lowered projections. Closing price came close to $735. 

P/L: $134

3. Sold AAPL 2 Apr 29 IC 95/98/110/113 for $1.10- I went a little over 1SD but not all the way to 1.5SD as the risk reward sucked. AAPL tanked on earnings real bad like never before and the stock opened at $96 the next day and my short puts were ITM. I do believe in AAPL and think it can go to $98 so I rolled my 95/98 put spread to May expiration. In doing this I had to buy back the 95/98 put spread for $0.88 and hence my loss went to $(0.88-0.37)*100*2=$102 for the time being. If AAPL does end up above $98 in May then I would profit $1.59*2*100=$318 on the put spread and hence make a profit eventually. Also, I let the call side expire which gave me $0.28*2*100=$56. Hence, this is a trade in progress and we will see what happens.

P/L=-$102 at this time.

4. Sold FB 3 Apr 29 IC 94/97/119/122 for $0.41- Again a little over 1SD trade. FB opened at $120 the next day. I panicked and sold the whole IC for a loss of $102. By the end of the day, the markets tanked and FB settled to $116 which was inside my IC and now I feel fucking stupid.

P/L:-$102.

5. Sold 2 AMZN Apr 29 IC 535/540/690/695 for $0.70- I made this trade when AMZN was trading at $615 in the day. 1SD was $50 so I went 1.5SD away. The problem was that AMZN closed at $605 for the day which made my position long delta. So I prayed for a earnings beat and AMZN delivered. Closing price today was $659 which made me full profit.

P/L:$140

6. Sold 10 CVX Apr 29 IC 97/100/108/111 for $0.20- I made this trade when CVX was trading at $104 during the day and had a 1SD of $2.5. So I made a trade with strikes $4 away. CVX closed at the end of the day at $102 and I was again at a situation where I was praying for earnings beat. CVX missed estimates but the stock still closed at $102.18 for the day. This was a trade that made me very nervous because of the leverage I was playing with. 10 contracts is a lot of leverage and max loss is in the thousands. One thing I learned after is that the call spread was only worth 1 cent and not worth doing at all (I paid more commissions than premium). In hindsight, I should have looked at the options chain more closely and placed my call spread closer.

P/L:$200 

Total P/L=$403 excluding commissions. AAPL is still an open trade and I might gain/lose that trade but overall this earnings week has been good gambling. Some trades like google and amazon were highly profitable (&gt;30%) while some were low (CVX 7%). No YOLO by any means.  ",8

I like ""picking stocks"" and mostly see myself as a ""dividend investor"". Since I want to keep my expenses low so I invest $2k at a time which keeps my costs to less than 1/2%. I like to ""buy and hold"".

The stocks I plan on are:

Roth IRA:
T
F
CALM

SEP-IRA (I only invest in this once a year after I figure out my side gig numbers at tax time so I don't get caught over-contributing):
BRK.B

Wife's Traditional IRA (just started this account for her and will put in 10% of her income, I contribute once a quarter and I think I'm going to use this as ""riskier"" plays):
UA

Regular Taxable Account (since my savings and e-fund are ""full"", I now invest this money in stocks): 
AAPL

Obviously, as I make more money, I'll contribute more to my positions or add new ones to diversify if I feel the value is right.

Portfolio in summary:
T
F
CALM
BRKB
UA

16-04-30,4h2s77,Looking for opinions on a free website to track holdings and rank key company fundamental health in a portfolio style list.,"Hi guys, I know this is asked a ton but I have been searching for weeks and I've yet to find something I'm satisfied with. I'm new to trading and I have been trying to evaluate my stock picks as well as find new stocks to invest in as I obtain more money to invest. I am actively selling things on eBay that have been sitting around and taking the profits to Robinhood. 

I'm trying to invest for a year(+) to avoid taxes on the gains (hopefully they're gains, haha) from each of my trades so I'm not too interested in sites that tell me how they're doing in the short term through technical analysis like so many do. My dream portfolio website would be:

- Free
- Allow multiple portfolios/watchlists
- Show total gains/losses from holdings
- Rank companies by things like fundamentals, growth and profit (or at least display changes in those numbers from quarter to quarter with graphs or color changes). Not just sortable fundamental data that I can compare only one metric at a time. I would love to easily know how they stand compared to their industry.
- Has an android app. 

**I've tried:**

[Investing.com](http://Investing.com) - Shows technical analysis (buy/sell based on graphs) in an easy to understand manner and displays fundamental numbers but gives no kind of analysis (recommendations/scoring, coloring, suggestions based on industry, etc) on them. No holdings information either. 

[Openfolio](http://Openfolio.com) - Connects with Robinhood, keeps up with my trades and shows how I'm doing compared to others on the site but doesn't offer any analysis and practically no info. 

[WSJ](http://Wsj.com) - Beautifully displayed and easy to understand technical and fundamentals but their portfolio is not even a portfolio. SO much potential but they fall short. They don’t even have an android app. Holding my breath for some improvements. 

[Msn](http://money.Msn.com) – Each ticker gives a lot of easy to understand graphs and info but not analysis on the portfolio view. Much better than WSJ’s attempt plus they have a windows and android app. 

[Nasdaq](http://Nasdaq.com) – Gives a lot of good information but has no real portfolio tracking. Just a list of saved symbols.

[Yahoo Finance](http://Finance.yahoo.com)– Hideous website but pretty nice app. Unfortunately, like most of these portfolio managers, it only overloads you with numbers and you cannot compare anything to the industry.

[Stockflare](http://Stockflare.com) – Beautiful website with star ratings and explanations but their android app has limited functionality. Also, it’s key metrics are limited even for a pathetic noob like me. A lot of its metrics are also based on forecasts not the past. Honestly, I just don’t trust this website. There’s something about it that don’t like but I can’t put my finger on it. Maybe one of you guys can articulate it better. 

[Stocktwits](http://Stocktwits.com) – Syncs with Robinhood which is nice but I only use it to see what happened when a stock is acting up. 

[Stockta](http://Stockta.com), [CNBC](http://Cnbc.com) and [Finviz](http://Finviz.com) are great screeners but that’s not really what I’m looking for. 

[Tickers.io](http://Tickers.io) is good to collect buy sell ratings but has no portfolio and I’m pretty sure (I’m sure) most of those buy and sell ratings are technical not fundamental. 

[Atlasofpublicstocks.com](http://Atlasofpublicstocks.com) – Is useful to see which companies support your local geographic area.

[Marketbeat](http://Marketbeat.com) – Shows you a few analyst recommendations and insider trading but has no free portfolio. They do have an app but I couldn’t get it to work.

**The “best” ones so far:**

[Sigfig](http://Sigfig.com) - Great for telling me how my holdings are doing since I bought them and gives fundamental info but no analysis (only sorting) and no technical info either. Does give some info about how I stand in terms of valuation and management metrics but only of my entire portfolio. Also has a “guidance” feature but it isn’t available for Robinhood users. 

[App.getaom.com](http://App.getaom.com) – Gives an outright score for each quote but it doesn’t really tell you why and it doesn’t have a portfolio (at least, a free one).

[Stockrover](http://Stockrover.com)- Gives you scores for each stock in terms of financial health, profitability and growth all viewable from your portfolio. They don’t have an android app though.

[Guru Focus](http://Gurufocus.com) –This portfolio view is highly customizable and they do have their own financial and strength profitability scores as an option among a ton of other things. (As I wrote this, I came across these features. This potentially satisfied every request for a portfolio!) Also, if you click or hover over the ticker for each stock, there’s more info about their fundamental and profitability scores. It also has a tab for performance and charts but they are premium only. Their android app is meh so far because it doesn’t show the custom portfolio view but their site is good all around!

[Stock2own](http://Stock2own.com) – Grades growth, colors fundamental numbers and gives you a recommendation about buying and selling the stock. However, it grades practically every stock in my portfolio F or E for growth (Who knows, maybe I’m that bad). They also have an app that works pretty well.

I came to this post trying to figure out which one to use as my main portfolio tool but I feel like so many of these websites have a strength of their own unique to others. Maybe you guys can help narrow them down or suggest one that magically unifies them all. Obviously, I'm sure this exists but behind a paywall - one in which I'd rather juggle 20 websites than pay.

I think I’m so actively trying to find a website that validates my picks because I’m nervous as a new investor. 

If anyone is interested in my probably pathetic portfolio and would like to shit on me for how awful of a trader I am, here you go - open to any suggestions/guidance: [https://openfolio.com/profile/66886066/](https://openfolio.com/profile/66886066/) (I'm going to sell all but one share of FCAU once the price levels out. Other than today, they've been doing well but I want to invest in many other companies rather than heavily rely on one/two. That's why today I dumped CECE for a whopping $4 profit.)

16-04-30,4h33fn,"So I'm absolutely baffled (FSLR)","""First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) reporting on Wednesday. Analysts are expecting $952 million in revenue and $0.88 per share in earnings""... http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/04/25/last-week-in-solar-2.aspx

Wednesday after the market closed at a share price of 62.03 and the earnings report which came at 4:30 the stock tumbled to $55.84 by Friday's closing.  So what I don't understand is 

Net sales for the company were down to $848 million in the first quarter, dropping $94 million from the fourth quarter of 2015, but up significantly on the same quarter a year earlier ($469 million).

So analysts predicted earnings to be .91 cents per share yet it was blown away by actually being $1.66.  However revenue was at 848 million which is much lower then the projected $962million.  How does stock fall 9% by a miss of revenue but a significant increase in share value?  Is it because of the CEO change?",1

16-04-30,4h3e59,"Let's talk about Silver (AG Technical analysis)","Here's my cash cow: First Majestic (AG)

Im not going to go into fundamentals, you can look at what the company does yourself, I don't feel like writing about that. But I will show you this:

http://imgur.com/1aBMKUi

That's a trend line (the green one just plots the breakout gain % whichyou can't see, around 70 percent)

This stock was juicy as fuck around February. I was already holding a ton then (I was long on silvercrest (svlc) and then they got bought by AG), but as soon as I saw the breakout I increased my position and have been all the way to where it is now.

NOT ALL TRENDS ARE CREATED EQUAL. IF YOU SEE A TREND THERE ARE ALOT OF OTHER FACTORS YOU MUST LOOK FOR TO DETERMINE IF IT HAS A HIGH PROBABILITY OF BREAKING THROUGH FOR MAD GAINS. If anyone here knows about TA (or at least read the first chapter of Trading Classic Chart Patterns), you'll see why this stock is so fucking sexy.... 

It's got (almost) everything going for it. 

1. Good wide spacing between point touches, 

2. a long trend line, 

3. 5-6 touches, at 

4. a good shallow angle, in 

5. a bear(ish) market going off the s&amp;p, and 

6. small market capitalization (around 1 billion). 

Only thing bad going for it is volume trend (increasing, though I don't put as much weight in volume as others may) and that the breakout happened at around the middle third of the yearly price range.

 Overall this stock gets a 5 rating (though you could argue it is as high as 6) around the breakout, and it sure as hell broke out. Anything over zero is a BUY.

MY trading style combines good TA with FA. Plus I look at the sector, and overall scheme of things in the market. With negative interest rates in some foreign banks, tech increasing, dollar weakening, this shit with Russia and Saudi Arabia, It's just a perfect storm for silver and possibly gold... Although I will admit Im very limited when it comes to looking at global trends and how sectors do relative to world news or whatever...

Next stop is 11, and it's gonna bounce off that probably, (resistance going back to the dreaded double top pattern from the summer of 2014 here http://imgur.com/e7fC5rd). but if it breaks that....
