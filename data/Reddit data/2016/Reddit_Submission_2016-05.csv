16-05-01,4h70s1,Saudi Arabia fucked themselves,"Their only chance is to cut and run, literally.

They had it, game set and match.  All they needed to do was shut the fuck up and pump oil.  They just had to talk about meetings and freezes.  Remember the tweet about the doha meeting and freezes that set it off?  As soon as that tweet came out oil went up about $2 instantly and it's been soaring ever since.  

They were SO CLOSE to bankrupting a shit ton of American companies.  Now US producers can hedge at $50 and pump freely for the next year (and oil futures are showing major hedging going on over a year out).

Just look at the contango at the CME site if you're in poverty.
http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/crude-oil/light-sweet-crude.html?4%3A59%3A18+PM+CEST=

It costs a ~$1 per month to store a barrel of oil so the price 12 months out should be ~12$+ higher but it's not.  It's $3 higher.  That means they are selling the shit out of future months while traders are buying the front months.

This shit is about to drop harder than the twin towers.  It might not be tomorrow or the next day, but i'm going to start scaling in oil shorts starting Monday/Tuesday.

16-05-01,4h7u4j,"UPS' upcoming pension-liability scare in nothing important.","I've only recently heard of [UPS' pension liability problem](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-28/ups-earnings-exceed-analyst-estimates-on-strong-u-s-results), but I wouldn't sweat it if I were you.  In fact, this problem could make you some serious cash.  The following is my arm-chair analysis.  

The projected upper-boundary on the cost of the pension-liability ""hit"" to UPS is US $3.8 billion (first paragraph of aforementioned article).  This would be a one-time charge.  Don't worry, though: 


* From 2011 to 2015, UPS' *mean*-average free-cash-flow was $4.76 billion ([Source](http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/UPS/financials/cash-flow))
* From 2011 to 2015, UPS' *median*-average free-cash-flow was $5.06 billion (Ibid.)
* **UPS SPENT $3.8 BILLION ON SHARE REPURCHASES IN 2013 ALONE** (Ibid.)
* From 2011 to 2015, UPS' *mean*-average share-repurchase costs were $2.7 billion (Ibid.)
* From 2011 to 2015, UPS' *median*-average share-repurchase costs were $2.7 billion (Ibid.)
* From 2011 to 2015, UPS' *median*-average net income was $3.8 billion (Ibid.)
* From 2011 to 2015, UPS' *median*-average total sales weres $55 billion (Ibid.)


Obviously, UPS is good for this little (potential!) $3.8 billion hit.  I was planning on writing a course-of-investing-action here as well, but I'm too tired.  The gist would have been to exploit a short-term dip in stock value as UPS cuts its share-repurchase budget to cover the pension hit.

16-05-01,4haqvk,April yolo returns,"http://imgur.com/XDackkg

Thought about not posting this month's stats as I'm not proud of it at all. Profit curve looks disgusting. Risk Reward looks disgusting. 

But a lot of people messaged me asking for progress and I think it would dishonest to cherry pick and only post good months and not bad ones. 

**So what went wrong?** Emotional trading. Not sticking to stop losses. Huge sizes. No proper money / risk-reward management. I'm trading more than twice as many shares per day as last month and making more than twice as many trades as last month. So more trading with more shares. This is typical sign when emotions get involved. 

**Why it went wrong?** I was moving at the start of the month. Then got sick in the middle of the month. By the end of the month, I was just burnt out I felt. I didn't get enough sleep, sometimes would be up all night. I was also in process of quitting my software consulting business and dealing with clients and wrapping things up has a toll on you. So all of these things combined led to this. 


All in all, I'm glad I'm green. Much better than losing money. But this upcoming month, I feel like I'm going into it with much better health and state of mind. 

P.S. For those who missed last month, here's the link: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/4cyeb7/march_yolo_returns/",72

I have an opportunity to contribute up to 10% of my paycheck in to participate in our companies' employee stock purchase plan (Comcast). Funds are withheld from our paycheck each quarter and the price of the purchased stock is 15% off the lower of the beginning or end contribution period.  

A key note is that this is an unqualified plan and does not get the favorable tax advantage and I am also required to hold the shares for one whole year before selling.  

Here are my personal numbers and I am not sure if it is worth it to continue.  

 01/01/2016 - 03/31/2016:   
Purchase Price: 47.29   
Total Shares: 39.361  
Total value/cost of : 1,861.54  
Tax on Paycheck: 542.53  

Total Cost (Stock Value + Tax) = 2404.07  

10/01/2015 - 12/31/2015:	  
Purchase Price: 47.97   
Total Shares: 67.356
Total value/cost of : 3230.78  
Tax on Paycheck: 570.10  

Total Cost (Stock Value + Tax) = 3800.88  

My question is that will i be taxed once more when I sell again, is it even worth it to have that much money locked in or will my money see better days else where.  

Total amount I paid (6204.95), current value in the market (6502.62), which is around a 4% gain if i sold today without any additional taxation

The article also did not give away what company it was talking about. It was one of those ""subscribe for more information"" deals. This caught me as suspicious, though if the source is reputable I figured it could be worth looking into further. 

So does any of this ring a bell? Have you seen this article, do you know what stock it is talking about, and is this trade actually worth pursuing?

Edit: found the article. Even if it's not worth investing, I'm still curious what stock they're talking about. Anyone know?

I'm completely new to investing. I'm 25 years old, have no debt, and my goal is to increase my overall net wealth. I have a somewhat high tolerance for risk, however this 10 grand is pretty much all of the savings I have in the world. Despite that, I realize investing is important and it's something I've become very keen on.

Today I invested 3,000 into wealthfront into a personal non IRA account. I plan on watching it this next year and see how it does before I decide to invest more. Was this wise of me? Any advice on what I should do with the other 7,000 would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

16-05-02,4hdp97,"Do you believe that if insider trading is legal and shorting is impossible, then a market is by definition inefficient?","I don't generally do x-posts of this nature in this sub, but I believe it is worthwhile for me to [show you a case where a tribunal ruled that insider trading is somewhat illegal](http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/treb-housing-data-competition-bureau-1.3557504).

For starters (who are non-Canadians), realtors here have access to confidential information about houses (such as price history at each historical sale of every property that exists, how many times it has been listed before finally being sold, etc...). Those who break the rules the ""mafia"" (Toronto Real Estate Board) had created would be kicked out of the mob. Now, just imagine if there is a stock market where the price history of every stock is confidential except to the stockbroker--yes, that means the buyer and seller would privately negotiate a price, and these prices are not available to anyone else except the broker. I think the market would collapse and millions would be jailed and given multimillion dollar fines. 

A few days ago, the government came in and said that the mafia's actions amount to anti-competition and therefore illegal. The fact that insiders have an advantage and are legally allowed to use it is very unfair to me.

The other pitfall of the housing market is that if someone, anyone, thinks it's going down, no one can find a good way to short it. The most direct way I know is to short mortgage bonds--but you only profit when either interest rates spike and/or mass default occurs. A severe housing crash need not to be caused by any of these things. You can have house prices crash 30% in 10 years without interest rates going up or a meaningful spike in the default rate of mortgages. Without the ability to bet against a market, that means everyone who participates is long and there is no force to correct imbalances--even if those forces want to act upon these imbalances by betting against them.

By what I mean ""inefficient"", I mean that when information appears (e.g. oil crash), it takes months to minimally affect the prices of homes. Whereas during the oil panic of January-February, stocks everywhere collapsed, home prices were only down minimally.",4

16-05-02,4hhg00,Social media data analytic tool on the Chinese stock market,"Hey fellow investors,

I recently created a new tool to provide useful social media data analytics on the Chinese stock market. It’s an tool that analyzes a large number of blogs, forum posts, local news feeds, etc. to figure out what Chinese investors are talking about, and it will provide this as intelligence to investors (currently in newsletter format, and eventually in live dashboard format).

Why the Chinese market? The Chinese stock market is dominated by retail investors (&gt;80% of investors in China are mom and pops, compared to only 30% in the US). Retail investors tend to trade more by herding, following stock tips, and overall being more emotional, so that’s why the Chinese market is so volatile and you see huge daily momentum on stocks. Compared to other western markets, social media should have a much larger impact on a Chinese stock’s rise and fall.

This is still in development but I really want to get you guys’ feedback on it. I’d be delighted if you would check it out [here](http://www.sinointelligence.com) and let me know if you find it useful. =)

Cheers,
Jason

16-05-02,4hh4iu,PGNX DD Update,"[Original DD!](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/4eaw8t/pgnx_dd/)

On my first DD I put a price target for PGNX at $5.50-6 last week we hit a high of $5.75. 

Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:PGNX) today announced that it has granted an exclusive license to Bayer for the development and commercialization of therapeutic antibodies combining the Company's prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) antibody technology with Bayer's targeted thorium conjugate technology.

""While there have been recent advances in the treatment of prostate cancer, there remains a great need for therapies that can more specifically target primary and metastatic prostate cancer,"" said Mark R. Baker, Chief Executive Officer of Progenics. ""This license agreement with Bayer further validates the value of our PSMA antibody technology in the development of targeted cancer treatments. We are pleased that Bayer recognizes the potential of our technology.""  

PSMA is a protein that has been found to be amplified on the surface of  &gt;95% of prostate cancer cells and is a validated target for the detection of primary and metastatic prostate cancer. Antibody-thorium conjugates are comprised of a radioactive alpha emitter, thorium-227, linked to an antibody, in this case PSMA. The thorium conjugates bind to the surface of tumor cells and emit alpha particles that destroy tumor cells by inducing DNA double-strand breaks, with no need for uptake into the cells for efficacy.

Per the terms of the license agreement, Progenics will receive an upfront fee and could receive additional potential clinical and regulatory development milestones. If approved, Progenics is entitled to single-digit royalties and sales milestone payments.

Bayer AG is a German multinational chemical and pharmaceutical company founded in Barmen, Germany in 1863. Bayer's primary areas of business include human and veterinary pharmaceuticals; consumer healthcare products; agricultural chemicals and biotechnology products; and high value polymers.

Bayers Revenue in 2014 was €42.23 billion and made a profit of €3.426 billion. It has a market cap of 82.65B. 

I see this as a huge step forward for PGNX. Bayer is a big company.  The upfront fee will hopefully enable PGNX to invest into R&amp;D. The royalties for PSMA if approved will be a very nice source of additional income to PGNX which should help them to continue with R&amp;D.

I originally had a $5.50-6 price target but I am now holding for the Long-term and hope to see PGNX hit analyst predictions at $11.50. 
Of course do your own research before you make any decisions.",11

16-05-02,4hhlsf,Biostage $BSTG,"Credit: Following analysis was developed in conjunction with Joel Cohen.

Biostage, formerly known as Harvard Apparatus Regenerative Technology $HART, has been making leaps and bounds in the last few months. I have had my eye on this company since last year, and have fallen in love with their doings. In 2016, they rebranded themselves as Biostage $BSTG, with a new slick website Biostage.com. I am no scientist, but I will do my best to break down what Biostage is all about.

Basically, what they do is a revolutionary method of organ regeneration. They use their “Cell Frame” technology which acts as a scaffold for the patient’s cells to grow around outside of the body. So, they are using the patient in need’s own cells to recreate an organ precisely prepared for them. Pretty cool stuff. I’ll leave the rest of the explaining to the company’s website.

**Fundamentals**
Biostage has a low float, around 12 Million shares. As a quick summary of float, float is the number of truly outstanding shares. Shares that you and I can buy on the market. So when a low float company comes out with good news, the amount of sellers are smaller than on a big name company like $AAPL because there are a lot less shares to be owned. What exactly is float? http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/float.asp

In addition, Biostage is performing large animal tests with the widely renowned healthcare company Mayo Clinic. Mayo Clinic is a big deal, they are ranked #1 in more specialties than any other hospital in the nation. So a little company like Biostage partnering with them on their trials is absolutely HUGE.

A quick list of some more positives:
– Zero debt financing
– Partial POSITIVE release of large animal data causing the stock price to soar in November 2015 http://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Harvard+Apparatus+(HART)+Announces+Significant+Results+For+Second+Generaton+Bioengineered+Implants/11065515.html
– Multiple additions to the team of experienced directors and additions to the development team.

There is much much more to be said about Biostage, but I do not want to spoil all of it for you. A quick listen to their most recent conference call on their website will have you in line to buy. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/edited-transcript-hart-earnings-conference-132145294.html

**Technicals**
Since Ticker Junkie was still an idea at the time, the alert to a perfectly formed wedge is now a bit late to call to your attention. However, for reference I have added in a picture of the chart. What do these wedges mean? http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wedge.asp

In addition, we were planning on getting a club broker through our club advisor and using the club's dues to buy stocks (We'll have about a thousand dollars)

I just had a couple questions:

* What simulation is the best? I currently use the Best Broker app on my iPhone to play the market by myself but thats not feasible for a club of 50 members

* Do you guys have any suggestions for a broker or account that'll allow us to buy stocks without paying any substantial fees? We don't have that much money (1000 dollars) and we'll need it all to buy stocks

* Do you guys have any suggestions on how to make my club better? I'm open to suggestions

* Are there any places of interest we can go as a club? The officers and I were planning on taking the club to DeSales University's stock simulation room this year or next and the New York Stock Exchange next year.

* Is there a website that I can show to members in my club that have no ideas how the market works? Something really simplified, like /r/explainlikeim5

16-05-02,4hjibq,My Swing/Day Trade Method.,"I've gotten a number of messages asking about how I screen for my daily watchlists and my method in general, so I thought I'd type it all out for those interested.  


While I have a background in finance and economics, I am by no means an expert, and have only been actively trading for a few months, but I have been consistently growing my portfolio since I implemented the below method.

First and foremost it is important to be able to read and analyze candlestick charts. This site has a great crash course in that, and in swing trading in general: http://www.swing-trade-stocks.com/index.html


My method is not about getting the huge breakout, but a number of small gains and keeping losses to a minimum.  I don't like holding on to stocks very long since I trade on a cash account, and all profits take 3 days to clear.  My goal for every trade is 5% and I only risk 5%.  I avoid big after-hours gains either way.  I my mind at least, if the price takes off before I can get it, I already missed it.  I dont trade off any news or earnings reports, as I want all my plays to be repeatable, with as little outside influence as possible.  While technically I deal in penny stocks, I like to avoid those under $1 since they are even more unpredictable.


Every evening after dinner I run my stock screens.  There are two main indicator scans I use.  One is Non-ADX 1,2,3,4, and the other is 1,2,3 Pullback.  This basically means the stock has had several days with lower lows but above its 50 day average, with the hopes it swings back up.  I filter it out to my price range for that day, and for volume (Usually above 250k). After I run both, I add any stocks that are common to both to my watchlist for the next morning.  I usually wait until the next morning to look into them further. 
I pull up the daily charts and first eliminate any that are not trending up.  Then I look for bullish candlesticks that have fallen below the 10 day SMA but above the 30 day EMA.  You want to make sure they have support, and have room to grow before any resistance.  I really like hammers, but any bullish candle will work.  


I usually find 2-3 from my watchlist which I make a move on.  
I try and get in right at opening, for as close to the opening price (or below) that I can.  I always set an initial stop loss of -5% of my purchase price.  As I stated before, my goal for every trade is +5% or more.  If the price goes over 5% i will monitor it more closely and let it rise until it dips back towards 5% or if it stalls at a single price for awhile.  If I am unable to pay much attention that particular day, ill set a limit sell for the +5% gain.  Towards the end of the trading day if its a small gain (under 3%) or it didnt hit the stop loss, I will let it carry over to the next day.  Above that I usually sell it off right before close.  Those that carry over I still look to sell once I get my 5%.  If it goes for 2-3 without hitting my goal for stop loss, Ill consider getting out early at a lesser gain.


So that's it in a nutshell, I'm open to any questions or suggestions you might have.  I'll also my plays today as an example in the comments. ",30

16-05-02,4hjzg2,[Advice] My friend and I just set up a stock market club at our school but we have questions on what to do,"Hello, my friend and I recently created a stock market club at our high school. We were planning on utilizing a stock market simulation game (such as the MarketWatch, Investopedia, or Wall Street Survivor programs) where we can practice buying larger shares of stock without using actual money.


In addition, we were planning on getting a club broker through our club advisor and using the club's dues to buy stocks (We'll have about a thousand dollars)

I just had a couple questions:

* What simulation is the best? I currently use the Best Broker app on my iPhone to play the market by myself but thats not feasible for a club of 50 members

* Do you guys have any suggestions for a broker or account that'll allow us to buy stocks without paying any substantial fees? We don't have that much money (1000 dollars) and we'll need it all to buy stocks

* Do you guys have any suggestions on how to make my club better? I'm open to suggestions

* Are there any places of interest we can go as a club? The officers and I were planning on taking the club to DeSales University's stock simulation room this year or next and the New York Stock Exchange next year.

* Is there a website that I can show to members in my club that have no ideas how the market works? Something really simplified, like /r/explainlikeim5

Here's the deal:

I'm new to all this penny stocks thing and I would like to trade. Since I'm from Brazil, am I able to open an account in any broker and trade by my own? 

Talking about money: In total I have smtg around U$700~800 to invest and this would be including everything (taxes, softwares, brokers etc).

My main questions are: What are your advices in general? Which broker should I pick?, Do the brokers offer me a free software or I'd need to buy one? Is there any stock alerts that you guys have been following that you find I should pay attention on?

LAST ONE: thoughts on tim sykes and his chatrooms?

ANY advice will be welcome and thanked!

16-05-03,4hkq5h,Anyone transferred brokerages to TradeKing?,"Moving from Capital One to TradeKing. Capital One's interface is just so damn difficult to manage options trading on. I have 20+ positions which can't even be sorted by expiration date and usually do multi-leg spreads/straddles which Capital One makes me go through their entire 3 step order process twice for each spread or straddle. 

Also their analytics completely ignore my options holdings. I have to pull everything in workbooks to analyze trade history and performance because Capital One is utterly useless. /rant

Moving to TradeKing because I really like the interface. Threw a few thousand into the account and started trading on it and I've been very happy so far. (Previously have used TD and Scottrade and was thinking about those, but TradeKing impressed me more).

I'm worried about the timing of my options coming over since they say it'll take 2-3 weeks and i have a bunch of expiration on May 20. What's the process look like? How long of a time period will I lack access to the options? Anyone else done this? Thanks.",7

Secular stagnation due to declining birthrates and economic models built by consumption growth. Everyone I talk to talks about not enough resources, too many people, the world is overpopulated and takes a Malthusian view. But the truth is that today, India, yes, freaking India today only has 2.5 children per women, barely above replacement level, Saudi Arabia is only at 2.7, down nearly half over the past 20 years. This means less people buying cars, buying houses, buying refrigerators, grocery shopping, it means less profits for companies selling those things, it means less employment as companies seek to make themselves more efficient rather than ramp up their sales force, R&amp;D and production.
The whole world is turning Japanese, it means innovation will stagnate, it means cyclical commodities are in a permanent decline, it means we are stuck permanently in a world of low interest rates, it means there will be very few good investments in developed markets, it means emerging markets are the only place to look for growth in the next 50 years.

16-05-03,4hpi2b,WSB Earnings Gambling 101,"I wanted to take a break from shitposting and offer something of substance for once.  Although I’m questionably qualified to give advice, here is my guide to gambling your borrowed money on stocks reporting earnings.

**Preface:**

The purpose of this is to list resources, methods, and thought processes so you can incorporate what I am sharing into your own trading.  I believe this will mostly help the noobs.  Maybe some people with more experience will find this useful?  I’m hoping anyone with more insight than me can add to the conversation.  This is not a suggestion or solicitation to buy, sell, or fuck yourself with any security.

**Components of an earnings announcement:**

•	Earnings per share (EPS):  How much did the company make or lose per share?  Was it above or below what was estimated?  In my experience EPS has the least amount of impact on share price move.

•	Revenue:  How much money did the money making part of the business bring in?  You can have great EPS, but if you’re not bringing in the business and report revenue under estimate the stock will probably go red.  Meeting, exceeding, or missing on revenue estimates typically does have an impact on share price move.

•	Guidance:  Where is the company going?  Good or even great EPS and Revenue can see a stock trade red after-hours if the guidance is below expectations.  While not always the case, I have noticed guidance typically drives the stock’s price movement the most.


•	The Market:  Yup.  Even if everything logical is saying the stock should go up or go down and it is doing the opposite.  The Market doesn’t give a FUCK about the Shouldland you’re living in.  Never underestimate a trade going completely wrong just because the market doesn’t give a shit about you or anything logical.  

**Who is announcing what when?**  

That’s the first question you want to ask yourself.  Yahoo earnings calendar is a great start.  I’ve since graduated to [EarningsWhisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com) and [Estimize](https://www.estimize.com).  [EarningsWhisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com) is a nice way to gauge how the stock has performed during past announcements.  [Estimize](https://www.estimize.com) is unmatched in helping visualize past earnings performance and future expectations.

**Take Action:**

You’ve found the stock you want to gamble on, but what is the best way to do it?

**If you’re bullish you can:**

Action| Pros | Cons
---|---|----
Buy the shares outright.    | You own equity.  If shares move up in AH or PM trading, you are poised to profit then or during market hours.  If shares drop, you still own the stock.| Stock needs to move a large % for YOLO gains.  If done correctly this comes with a large capital requirement.
Buy calls.| Cheaper than buying the stock outright.  Wild gains if stock moves up a large amount.| Can easily take 100% loss even with reasonable strikes and expirations.  IV Crush will fuck your butthole.
Sell Puts.| You get paid right away.  IV crush works in your favor.  If a stock gets put to you, you now own the equity.| Need the capital and privileges to have a stock put to you if you're wrong.
Call Spread.| Position yourself for upside gains while lowering your cost basis and maximum loss.  Selling premium.| Gains are capped.  Buying and writing contracts increases commission costs.

**If you’re bearish you can:**

Action| Pros | Cons
---|---|----
Short the shares outright.  | Simplest way to bet against a stock.| Infinite loss potential.  Covering shares while the stock moves north is very painful.
Buy puts.| Normally cheaper than shorting the stock.  Wild gains if stock moves a large amount down.| Can easily take 100% loss even with reasonable strikes and expirations.  IV Crush will fuck you butthole.
Sell Calls.| You get paid right away.  IV crush works in your favor.  | Infinite loss potential.  Much higher loss potential than shorting the stock.
Put Spread.| Position yourself for downside gains while lowering your cost basis and maximum loss.  Selling premium.| Gains are capped.  Buying and writing contracts increases commission costs.

Of course there are other strategies than what is listed above.  You'll see some people suggesting selling Iron Condors as an almost sure way to ""collect premium"" on a volatile stock regardless of which direction it goes after earnings.  Find what works for you and apply it.

**Some of my notable earnings gambles:**

Winners:

Options| % Gain
---|---
COLM Aug 21 2015 65.0 Call| 460.72%
WDC Sep 18 2015 85.0 Call| 341.69%
SYY Aug 21 2015 37.0 Call| 167.79%
EMN Aug 21 2015 80.0 Call| 143.33%
NFLX Jan 22 2016 90.0 Put| 835.44%
AAPL Apr 29 2016 102.0 Put| 308.66%

Losers:

Options| % Gain
---|---
TREX Sep 18 2015 50.0 Call| -100.00%
KMX Sep 18 2015 60.0 Put| -100.00%
FB Nov 06 2015 100.0 Put| -99.01%
BBBY Jan 15 2016 50.0 Call| -100.00%
MW Jan 15 2016 25.0 Call| -100.00%
MU Feb 19 2016 15.0 Call| -100.00%

This by no means is meant to impress anyone.  I fucked up more trades than I've had successful ones.  Maybe one day I'll be able to say I've had more gains than losses in this account, but we're a few good trades away from that still.

**My Methodology:**

After some $SPY puts thrashing and almost decimating my play account for a 2nd time I decided to gamble on earnings again with either call or put spreads.  This helps me lower my cost basis, mitigate risk, and maximize return.  For instance I am gambling on $PZZA earnings AH today.  First I will look at [Estimize](http://i.imgur.com/9DPQUmW.jpg) to get a feel for how they've done in the past as well as what to expect for this earnings.  Looking only at the revenue screenshot I'm seeing current Q1 guidance is only slightly above previous Q1 guidance.  My thoughts already are they will deliver good earnings.  Whether or not they will and how the market reacts is completely out of my control.  Next I check the [charts](http://i.imgur.com/bV6jrwV.jpg).  Nothing compelling there beside the stock has traded higher and has sometimes reacted violently to earnings announcements.  Being I'm bullish [I'm now analyzing the profit/loss of a call spread](http://i.imgur.com/EX1pZXS.jpg) that expires 18 days from now.  You can see my maximum loss is $365 while my maximum profit potential is $2,135 even if I only have a 21% chance of the underlying touching that $65 strike.  Without writing calls my cost basis would be closer to $600.  I'd rather lose 100% of $365 than $600.  While trading like this won't spare you from the IV crush, selling a put or call in addition to one purchased helps offset that slightly.


**Closing:**

We all about the yolo swag max gainz around here, nigga.  Trading earnings can lead to explosive returns and it can also empty your account if you go too hard on a trade and end up wrong.  $AAPL, $TSLA, $FB, $AMZN and plenty of other stocks are a blast to trade around earnings and gains are there to be made.  Don't be a fucking retard about it and maybe you'll be posting gains instead of QQ sessions about your account getting destroyed.  Remember you can always trade AFTER the earnings announcement and sometimes get just as good of returns.  Good luck, have fun, and be sure to go fuck yourself!

Edit:

$PZZA AH not looking good.  Solid EPS beat, but revenue did not meet expectations and guidance provided did not impress.  The guidance given is a year over year increase so maybe having this spread out a few weeks will help with the outcome and people will buy the dip.

First, I know I want to make a call option. meaning I know that I want to puchase the option to buy the stock back at a lower price (assuming the price goes ABOVE the strike price I purchase)

I am having problems placing my order. The first problem is I am assuming I am ""Buy to Open"" orders. However, there are other selections that I am not sure what the mean, mainly ""Buy to Close"" ""Sell to Open"" and ""Sell to Close"". I assume I want to ""Buy to Open"" the contract, however when I try this it says I am not allow to place uncovered calls. What does this mean?

Second, how do I calculate the actual price of the option per contract? For example if a 14.50 call is currently asking 0.30, is that 0.30 per contract or per share (100x shares)?

It is purely in the theory stage but so far, it has been very successful for me. The problem is quickly identifying this pattern to be able to act on it.

How it works, Find a high volume stock that is under going a larger than normal change through the day overall. I tend to find stocks at that down to be best. Usually as it falls you will see drops and gains, if you go back and look historically there is typically a bump after a fall, then another bump. If the last 5 minutes have had 4 up ticks then I mark it as a buy, if it has had 4 down ticks I mark it as a sell. Here is a visual example.

16-05-03,4hpqqk,NovaCopper (NCQ) Reports 173% Increase in Indicated Copper Resources at the Bornite Project,"Seth Klarman's Baupost Group owns this stock by the way. $80M market cap, just made a huge discovery of additional copper reserves.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/novacopper-reports-173-increase-indicated-110000786.html

* At a base case 0.50% copper cutoff grade, the Bornite Project is estimated to contain in-pit Indicated Resources of 40.5 million tonnes at 1.02% copper for 913 million pounds of contained copper (see Table 1 for details).
* At a base case 0.50% copper cutoff grade, the Bornite Project is estimated to contain in-pit Inferred Resources of 84.1 million tonnes at 0.95% copper for 1.8 billion pounds of contained copper (see Table 1 for details).

* At a base case 1.50% copper cutoff grade, the Bornite Project is estimated to contain below-pit Inferred Resources of 57.8 million tonnes at 2.89% copper for 3.7 billion pounds of contained copper (see Table 2 for details).
Contained copper in Indicated Resources has increased from 334 to 913 million pounds which constitutes a 173% increase in contained metal (see Figure 1 for details).

* Total contained copper in Inferred Resources has decreased from 5,969 to 5,450 million pounds (1,768Mlbs in-pit and 3,683Mlbs below-pit) which constitutes a 4% decrease in contained metal (see Figure 1 for details).  The reduction in contained copper is due principally to moving in-pit Inferred Resources to the Indicated category.

""We are extremely pleased with the expansion of the Indicated Resources at Bornite. This increase in in-pit Indicated Resources is a huge value-add for shareholders. This increase came at a very low cost as we were able to effectively utilize an extensive database that has been developed on this property.  By applying a well-executed, geologically-focused re-log and re-assay program we have added more high quality copper resources at an average grade of approximately 1% copper in a potential open-pit mine scenario. The resource model also shows that there is ample room to expand the resources adjacent to the current in-pit endowment, as well as down dip to the north and east of the below-pit resources. Importantly, given that the amount of contained metal in the in-pit resource is insensitive to changes in the copper cutoff grade, the project should provide great flexibility in mining selectivity during future mine planning,""  said Mr. Rick Van Nieuwenhuyse , NovaCopper's President and Chief Executive Officer.",3

16-05-03,4hqcrp,$entl entellus medical half-assed dd ER IS TOMORROW AH,"So about 5 months ago I brought up entl to you guys. The only reason I know about entl is because a friend works there. No I don't get insider information, the guy is scared shitless to share any thing at all.

The company literally cures sinus headaches and chronic sinusitis by blowing up a fucking baloon in your sinuses. Sounds like a joke but it works, the data is super clear, results are very positive. Long term I see the company taking off. They also can do the procedure in the doc office, no extra visit required, no surgery prep. Nothing. 1 hour process and you get instant relief from sinusitis.

(I want them to advertise so badly on the weather channel it hurts me)

So here we are some months later and what's new?

Long story is after IPO, analysts loved the stock. The vision was that the company was going to blast into the stratosphere right off the bat, revenues pouring in. 

But that wasn't the companies plan. They needed the IPO for boosting headcount and real estate. As such they grew head count by 400% since IPO and leased a new building. They now sit on a debt: cash ration of about 5 last time I checked. 

So they are in a little bit of an issue if they don't start boosting revenue substantially, 140 million in debt or so and revenues have been growing, but the rate of growth didn't match that of debt growth. Investors hated this. But it makes sense. The last two quarters were exclusively for spending on future growth.

So I think there was a massive over reaction to the increase in debt and whatever the EPS was. Long term, all else being equal, these are all good signs. Short term, this was very worrisome.

Now. I think head count hiring has slowed or even halted completely. There are no new building leases. There will be increased spending on marketing itself, but now to accounts payable - to marketing initiatives.

Additionally the company is still spending on r&amp;d and will be releasing new products sometime in the future. No idea when currently.

Im playing earnings with long equity. I'm not exceptionally bullish but I believe by the end of the year this company will be back into 25 PPS if not more. Going into 2017 I expect them to break 30.

I'm writing mostly because the company deserves more volume and I hope you yoloers all have sinusitis and this company can hedge your life.",3

The only argument for lump sum investing seems to be that ""markets tend to move higher"". 

Am I alone in thinking this is an absurd assumption? It fails to take into account risk premium. While it is possible that you may end up with a higher cost basis by dollar cost averaging, you can chalk that up as a premium for risk mitigation that you otherwise wouldn't have in lump sum investing.

Seems to me that those believing the lump sum theory fail to take into account the expected value of future losses. That's just my opinion and would be interested in hearing other thoughts.

2. Fitbit (FIT) : This company had a lot of hype this quarter but has been experiencing drawback these past few days due to fear over the public interest of the product now a days. I personally think it will rise but people think otherwise. 
3. Yamana Gold (AUY) : I honestly can't think of a reason why this company has been dropping over the past few days except for pressure from slightly bad commodities prices this week. Gold, silver, and copper have been super strong this quarter and this company has taken advantage of it experiencing over a 200% growth in Stock price since January. Also after they released their preliminary q1 results a month or so back the stock price jumped as well. I really feel strongly that their earnings will be positive and that this company will help me buy my yacht. 
Lmk if you agree/disagree with any of my thoughts above and if you have any other possible earnings shifts ideas than comment them!",2
16-05-04,4hsc15,Suggestions for longterm investment for retirement (20 year+). Advice needed.,"I'm trying to play catchup from years of not investing. Myself and my wife both come from families where money was always scarce and investing for the future wasn't ever discussed, much less budgeting or planning. We're working on changing that so our children have an easier time once they're older as well as making sure we're not in desperate times once retirement comes along. 
  
I have about 30 years untill retirement age but I work freelance in the arts industry so future income is never guaranteed. Work coming though now pays well and my personal expenses are low so I'm looking to put as much cash into retirement as possible and as fast as I can to max potential gain. We're fortunate in that my wife holds a well paying job but we live in live in NYC so money doesn't go as far as it should do. 

I just started investing about 8 months ago and currently have about 7k invested in a Roth between AAPL, VOO, V and BRK.B. Due to a few mistakes buying/selling and learning I'm at about a -3% loss over all but feel my current holds are fairly stable and worth holding. 

Can anyone offer any further advice or changes that I should be looking to add/do? Ideally at the moment I'd like to plan for a minimum of $10k a year to invest for as long as possible. A Roth IRA is my only account as of present.

16-05-04,4hv6c9,A look at Flexion Therapeutics $FLXN,"All Ticker Junkie analyses are up for discussion directly under its post. Feel free to leave constructive criticism. We are all here to assist and make one another better.

OA = Osteoarthritis http://www.arthritis.org/about-arthritis/types/osteoarthritis/what-is-osteoarthritis.php

Flexion has been on my eye since the new year. I listened to their most recent conference call a few times (http://ir.flexiontherapeutics.com/eventdetail.cfm?eventid=170651), and reviewed their pipeline especially their lead drug, Zilretta. It’s truly a tug on the brain when you hear medical terms that you actually know offhand when researching a company.

I have taken a quote from their website to describe Zilretta: “Flexion’s lead product candidate is a sustained-release intra-articular, non-opioid analgesic candidate targeting moderate to severe osteoarthritis (OA) pain. OA afflicts millions of people in the United States and accounts for over $185 billion of annual healthcare expenditures.” From what I can gather, their steroid is different than what is on today’s market because it releases into the patient over time rather than an all-in-one dosage. This release over time results in the steroid functioning in that particular area longer, and therefore more effectively. A quick note: the steroid used in Zilretta is already FDA approved, what Flexion needs to be approved is the dissolvable spheres that carry the steroid. A video on their website provides a visual of what their drug does: http://flexiontherapeutics.com/plga-video/


**Key Factors**
– Total Cash: 132.17M
– Share Outstanding: 21.57M
– Float: 15.12M Low float can be a bullish indicator as it means insiders and institutions hold a large sum of shares. What is float? http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/float.asp
– Insider transactions not looking real pretty with the largest holder NOVO Group selling off approximately 50% of their shares. http://finance.yahoo.com/q/it?s=FLXN+Insider+Transactions


**Pros**
– Zilretta, if approved would be marketable to approximately 25 million US patients, and these people “account for over $185 billion of annual healthcare expenditures.”
– Awarded a $2 million grant by the US Department of Defense to help their Zilretta phase 2 trial on service members with post-traumatic OA.
– “In June, data from our first phase 2b efficacy trial of Zilretta which demonstrated better and longer pain relief compared to the standard of immediate release TCA. Was published in the Journal of Bone and Joint surgery.”
– “Secured a $30 million non-dilutive debt financing with Silicon Valley bank and MidCap financial to provide the funding for the manufacturing expansion with Patheon.”
– In September 2015 the FDA had granted fast track status to Zilretta.
– “In February of this year we reported a positive top line phase 3 clinical trial data for Zilretta whereby it met its primary end-point at week 12.”


**Neutral**
– Signed an agreement with Patheon as the contract manufacturer for planned commercial manufacturing of Zilretta.
– “Published in the Journal of Bone and Joint surgery. A pre-eminent journal amongst orthopedic surgeons who are key decision makers in the management of OA patients.”
– Hired a pharmaceutical manufacturing operations executive (Scott Canute)
– Drugs with fast track designation generally qualify for quality review if supported by clinical data at the time of NDA filing thereby expediting the FDA review process. (If you want to follow/trade $FLXN be weary results MIGHT come out in-sync.)
– IMPORTANT “Zilretta demonstrated superiority to Placebo in pain relief beginning at week 1 continuing to week 11 an also at week 13 where p-value was less than 0.05 at each time point.” BUT week 12 “did not reach statistical significance with p-value of 0.0821.”
– Zilretta’s pain-relief comparison to immediate release steroids is not statistically different/significant, however it does last longer
– Upcoming meeting scheduled with the FDA to establish the file ability of an NDA for Zilretta.
– “Our confidence in the path of outcome from that meeting is bolstered by feedback we have received from experienced regulatory consultants who have reviewed the data under confidentiality.” “The reaction to the data was very enthusiastic.”


**Cons**
– “R&amp;D expenses to increase over the next several years due to late stage trials being conducted for Zilretta.”
– Week 12 showed a variation in expected results (as noted above), leads to some questioning


**Timeline**
“First, we have scheduled a pre-NDA meeting with the FA and we remain optimistic that they will view the totality of our clinical data as supportive of an NDA filing for Zilretta in the second half of 2016. Second, we expect to initiate a clinical trial of Zilretta in patients with OA of the knee who also have diabetes.”
– Note: “Approximately 20% patients with knee OA have diabetes in clinical trial data demonstrated when these patients when treated intra-articular injections of immediate release TCA as well as other corticosteroids can experience substantial elevation in blood glucose levels in the days post injection.”
– Another note: The clinical trial of Zilretta in patients with OA who also have diabetes began April 28th http://finance.yahoo.com/news/flexion-therapeutics-enrolls-first-patient-200500885.html


**Noteworthy Quotes**
“We believe that administration of Zilretta has the potential to avoid elevated blood glucose levels an thus be positioned to confer patients with diabetes not only better pain relief but improved safety as well.
“We expect that Zilretta could become frontline therapy for approximately 800,000 diabetic patients in the U.S. currently receiving immediate release steroids for OA of the knee.”


**Conclusion**
The overall sentiment I am left with on Flexion Therapeutics would be Bullish. There are definitely a couple question marks in this analysis and I realize that, but I believe these question marks are outweighed. This counterweight would be the sheer fact that the drug within the dissolvable spheres is already FDA approved. When I read that, I was intrigued by that fact that they only have to show statistical evidence of these dissolvable spheres having superiority over the existing dose. I also love some of the positives they mentioned such as having professionals anonymously review their clinical findings and showing “enthusiasm.” Another big upside is the number of people this drug would benefit, and for those with diabetes even more of a benefit. I believe their mission is achievable for the good of those with OA and investors alike.

16-05-04,4hv80t,Financial Transaction Tax - discussion,"Please - No political debate in regards to a specific candidates, there are subs for that.

Whatever your political leanings, I'd like to know more about Financial Transaction Taxes (FTT).  The concept of a transactional tax is not new and the first instance was in 1694 in the form of a tax required for formalizing a purchase of stocks.  From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_transaction_tax)

In one respect, I don't see this as any different than a sales tax.  I pay 6% state sales tax (MI) for any finished good I purchase, regardless of whether that is used as an appreciating or revenue generating asset.  I buy a car, 6% sales tax even if I use it for Uber. Sales tax on the clothes I'm required to wear to work. There are obviously taxes on capital expenses, and other things as well.  Whatever I purchase, it falls into goods or services.  The majority of the goods I purchase are severely depreciating assets because I wear them, drive them, eat them, etc. Some can appreciate or depreciate, such as a house.  

On the other side, capital gains are already taxed as income which is a pretty strong incentive for me to buy and hold.  

Other than:

Pros - reduced incentive to actively trade, reduced volatility, limits on high frequency trading, additional tax revenue and relatively easy to manage tax collection. 

Cons - higher burden on financial industry, may discourage people from entering into financial markets as well, cost may simply be passed onto clients of brokerage firms through higher fees - impacting the risk-averse investors out there, managing the purchase of overseas companies

what are the other aspects I might not be considering?",6

16-05-04,4hv9b7,"I like SIRI, its made me some nice change. But where can it go from here?","Bought SIRI in 2009 when the stock was trading for pennies--one of the first stocks I ever bought. Added to the position when it was somewhere in the 2 dollar range. Now the stock is at $3.94. 

I understand there are a ton of shares, and the P/E of 35.64 indicates it's not exactly a value stock, despite its low apparent price. But I like the company's position. I like how they've managed themselves. They took big profits last quarter, and while people keep mentioning Pandora and Spotify and others as competitors, the truth is, SIRI fills a niche that those other services don't.

Am I missing something? Company makes money, keeps adding subscribers, and there's still plenty of room to grow. Barring a catastrophic destruction of satellites, there doesn't appear to be any immediate threat.

Is SIRI still a strong buy at $3.94? Or it's 52-week high, $4.20?

16-05-04,4hvppq,New Broker Questions,"Hi.  I am what some may call a YOLO'er in the sense that volatility attracts me, im in the business of losing money, and I am young.  

I originally started using Just2Trade, which is now WhoTrades.  They are a good broker, a solid platform, but I need a 10k balance to short.  and I am not there yet.  I currently have no equity as college has been tapping my account like a maple tree.  I have like $100 on robinhood to play with.  Its a good tool for the impulsive trader. but im not sure its reliable enough to keep using.  Once I make serious trades i dont want to have the discomfort associated with an iphone based platform.  

So my question is, if I plan to pump in a cool 4k in a week, where should I pump it? Flat rates per trade are ideal, commission is dumb.  I just want to be able to buy and short.  Any advice?",1

Good morning traders of the r/stocks sub! Here are your pre-market news movers on this Wednesday morning-

&gt; **Time Warner** — Time Warner earned an adjusted $1.49 per share for the first quarter, 19 cents a share above estimates. Revenue was slightly above forecasts. The bottom line was helped by earnings growth at the HBO and Turner units.

**TICKER SYMBOL:** TWX

&gt; **Priceline Group** — The travel services website operator reported adjusted quarterly profit of $10.54 per share, outdistancing estimates of $9.65 a share. A 31 percent jump in hotel room night reservations was a key factor in Priceline's results. However, the company's current-quarter forecast is well below Street estimates.

**TICKER SYMBOL:** PCLN

&gt; **Energizer** — The battery maker came in 5 cents a share above estimates with adjusted quarterly profit of 26 cents per share. Revenue was well above forecasts, as well. The company also increased its full-year outlook, as it benefits from stronger pricing in international markets and wider U.S. distribution.

&gt; **CBS** — CBS reported quarterly earnings of $1.02 per share, 8 cents a share above estimates. Revenue was slightly above forecasts. CBS was helped by a surge in ad spending, due in part to the Super Bowl, as well as the presidential campaign.

&gt; **Etsy** — Etsy earned 1 cent per share for its latest quarter, compared to the Street's forecast of a 2 cents per share loss.

&gt; **Illumina** — Illumina missed estimates by 3 cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of 71 cents per share.

&gt; **Avis Budget** — Avis Budget posted a 28 cents per share loss for its first quarter, 20 cents a share wider than analysts had been expecting. Revenue for the car rental company did match estimates, and its full-year revenue projection is above Street forecasts. The company said the first-quarter loss reflects ""unusually soft pricing"" in certain markets, as well as modest demand growth.

&gt;More than anything else, business has been troubled by Mr Trump’s protectionist threats to rip up trade deals and impose punitive tariffs on imports. 

&gt;Corporate America has an interest in the issue where Mr Trump’s populist invective has been most controversial: immigration. 

&gt;On Wednesday a Chamber spokesperson said the group would not discuss Mr Trump and his personality, but said companies confronted “extraordinary political and geopolitical uncertainty” and added: “Politicians should think twice before bashing business.” 

&gt;A Washington lobbyist cited tax policy as an area of concern, noting that Mr Trump has been critical of americans corporations using deals known as inversions to shift their addresses overseas. 

&gt;Mr Trump’s hardline stance against illegal immigration has shut off the debate big business would like to have about how to overhaul the US immigration system to help bring in more of the workers they need. 

&gt;More pressingly, Mr Trump’s proposal to deport some 11m unauthorised immigrants would wreak social and economic havoc given that so many have been integral members of the US labour force, notably in the farming industry, construction industry and restaurant industry.

16-05-04,4hw6nf,Beginner here. Please have a look and evaluate my analysis of NVDA,"Allow me to preface this by saying I am brand new to all stock picking. Please feel free to criticize any errors I have made in my thought process and let me know if there’s something I may have missed. Thanks.

**Reason I like NVDA:**

Given the growing popularity of virtual reality, I was looking for a way to safely tap into this market. Through casual youtubing I noticed 3 popular youtubers all using the HTC vive. After doing some short research I found that vive was Steam powered, telling me that there was a decent foundation under the product given Steams user base.

However, HTC is listed on the TSE, an exchange I have no access to and I’m not fond of the idea of going on the OTC market. In looking at ways to invest in HTC, I came across a post where a user was looking to enter the VR market and it was suggested to him that he invest in NVDA as their products are used by HTC. Through my own research I also found out that Oculus (FB) also use NVDA technology, meaning I am taking advantage of two big VR players by buying NVDA stock. As an added bonus, I found out that Tesla uses NVDA products as well.

While the prospects seem nice, I don’t want to get burnt while waiting an unknown amount of time for the stock to take off (if it does). For that reason, I want to make sure the fundamentals are solid to limit my risk.

I would greatly appreciate if you had a look at my evaluation and point out any flaws or things I may have overlooked. Any insight is welcome as I am brand new to stock picking. Thanks

**ALL NUMBERS TAKEN FROM YAHOO FINANCE**

**P/E:** 33.33, high compared to QCOM (16.98) and INTC (13.14). However, using year over year stock price history (Jan 30, 2015 – Feb 1, 2016), price went from 19.64 to 29.26, an increase of 32.87%. In *One Up on Wall Street*, Peter Lynch says it is favourable if the P/E is less than the growth rate. While the P/E is higher in this case, it is not dramatically so. For that reason, I do not think the company is overvalued or a bubble waiting to burst.

Furthermore, Investopedia states:

&gt;“In essence, the price-earnings ratio indicates the dollar amount an investor can expect to invest in a company in order to receive one dollar of that company’s earnings”  

By this logic, at a current share price of $36 (on May 2), would I be accurate in saying that I’m paying $33.33 for a dollar of earnings and getting some added value through the $2.67 difference?

**Income Statement:** Gross profit has increased for two consecutive years (7.54% from 2015 to 2016 and 12.74% from 2014 to 2015) but operating income is down 1.58% due to a sharp increase in selling general and administrative costs (up 20.26% compared to 9.17% for the year prior). I’m not sure what to make of non-recurring expense of 131k as there are no numbers to compare it to (if someone can shine some light on this I would appreciate it).

I noticed that gross profit in 2016 is down 5.2% from the 2014-15 figure while selling and general admin costs are up 11.09% for the same time span. Could this indicate inefficiency in spending? Why did increased spending result in decreased gross profit?

Income from continuing operations is little changed, therefore the decrease in net income is a result of the increased spending/lower gross profit combination.

Seeing as NVDA is a large company with some decent prospects on the horizon, maybe this balance sheet is reflecting this company’s planning for the future. If this is the case, I shouldn’t sweat it.

**Balance Sheet:** Total assets and net tangible assets have increased 2.29% and 2.9% respectively, while total liability has only increased 1.1%, so assets are outpacing the rate at which liability is growing. Furthermore, inventories are down from the previous year, meaning product is getting off the shelf. I think there are only positives to be taken from the balance sheet.

16-05-05,4hyxv5,Overnight Futures Development (05/05/2016),"In an effort to add more useful info to this sub gonna start posting some stuff about SPX/CL futures development overnight.

Here is a 5 min chart of SPX futures since yesterday's close (4PM):

http://imgur.com/QAEXakC

We closed at the purple line, so we are up about 10 points. This is not surprising, a relief was probably coming regardless. However, that 2056-2057 level is proving to be difficult to break. Based on this, SPY will open up around 206 flat tomorrow. Currently SPY has gaps to fill up to 207.97. A rally up to that 208 level is quite possible, especially with the help of an oil rebound. Friday will be a question mark depending on job reports. 

Mainly have to see the next 5 hrs play out. Futures do not like that 2056-2057 level, currently down to 2052. Now back up to 2057, reaching a new high this morning and trying to break through. As always, expect the unexpected. We are looking to break 2060 now.

Here is the 5 min chart of CL futures since yesterday's market close (4PM):

http://imgur.com/zUDKJjE

Crude oil has rebounded well based on the US production cut news. With API and EIA report barely effecting oil negatively, all eyes are on rig count (could also have no major effect) and the same reports next week. Unless some major bearish news comes out for oil... RIP all DWTI holders...

My plays for today:

1) Currently holding put spreads out for June, will continue to hold. Plan to grab more of them if we fill the gap.

2) Look for futures gain and strength to remain till market open. First 30-60 mins will help me discern whether a possible gap up is coming or not. Plan to grab some weekly calls if so, otherwise will stay cash. 

EDIT: Right as I finish writing this, oil breaks 45 and hits 45.27... and it does not like that level either 

SPX touches 2060, and falls back down to 2053. Clearly does not like being above the 2057 resistance. It is staying right in the 2052-2054 area, meaning we will open up about 7-10 points up.

16-05-05,4hxy4l,Possible investment securities fraud?,"I already had an over an hour long telephone consultation with a lawyer about this and she seemed really eager to take the case. I believe she also said she was willing to actually look at the financial documents before she takes the case to see if it's possible. But I thought I'd see if I can get some other opinions.

My father passed away recently and he had an IRA. The IRA was managed by an investment firm and they allocated him into 100% stocks which is a very risky move for someone 68 years old. He didn't like the riskiness of it and also wanted an ideal 6% return to live off of per year. I believe that he didn't account for the management fees they'd take out though. The IRA is now in my mom's possession who is 69.

Now the question I am asking is that this mutual fund this investment even though much more riskier during down movements. The portfolio might have returned approximately the same amount even if a less risky alternative was chosen.

Google finance tells me it was about a 22% return over past 6 years. The same market index, the NasDaq, it's based off of gave a 117% return over past 6 years.

All other mutual funds seem to have given a similar return as well. So right now it seems like either all mutual funds are a scam or I really don't have much to fight over.

A mix of bonds and nasdaq index fund would have yeilded a 91% return.

My math might be off though. So I'm not sure if there is even really anything to actually fight over accept that. The lawyer fees would be around 20-30k initially + 40% of whatever is ""won"".

So I'm not sure what to do. I decided to ask /r/investing over /r/legaladvice.

I found this while searching for eggs on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4dll5p/huge_news_department_of_labor_will_require/?limit=1500#d1s5g90 might be relevant to anyone curious about my situation.

I'm not experienced with investing, but I've learned a lot lately. I have a strong enough grasp to understand that there's essentially no point in me devoting any more time to studying investing because my business offers a much higher return on my time. Pretty sure the standard answer to that statement = then just buy some broad indexes that track the S&amp;P. For an employee, I'd agree. But the potential of short term market volatility is more of a rational concern for me as an entrepreneur because it's quite possible that I may have a sudden use for the capital that will easily outperform even the greatest historic years of the S&amp;P.

I'm not scared of being aggressive, but it just seems dumb for a business owner to throw the majority of my net worth into a comparatively low return asset that's also subject to significant potential losses, in which I have no competitive advantage, as well as no influence upon.  So that pretty much rules out equities for now, unless there are some remarkably stable blue chip funds?

I have even less understanding of bonds, but I infer that is the asset class worth considering vs just staying 100% liquid / 100% guaranteed in a 1% savings account. 

For simplicity, ignore deferred income tax sheltering advantages.

I don't know the future, but let's pretend I have a strong guess when I'll have a compelling use for the money.

I asked about fees and the FA told me that they don't charge fees for their services, that I would only be paying fees on the mutual funds and ETFs I was invested in. 
Is this true? I find it very hard to believe that this is something they do free of charge. Does anyone have any experience with their services? 

Any general input would be appreciated.",4

My question is: if you're a long-term holder in a company what's the end game? Say you analyze XYZ Widgets and think they're a good 5+ year investment. In 5 years, it's paid off the share price has grown X% and you're happy. Do people just say ""that was a good 5 years"" and sell? On to the next stock? 

I guess I don't understand what happens when you're ""done"" with an investment. Or maybe after those 5 years you'd sell some and keep a position? Idk, please help me understand",2

They've been really hammered, to the point where volume has nearly dissipated, but I see them on track to $20 quickly.

They have yet to produce net profits, but from their guidance this is one of their best q1s ever. They are projected to become profitable with cash on hand- no need for dilution, loans, or other sources.

Entellus is a company that produces various devices for ent specialists specifically for sinus relief procedures. Their procedures blow the competition out of the water both by efficacy and by minimizing adverse events.

I have a decent background in the stock market and basic economics, though I don't think I know nearly enough to form a solid opinion on Trump's potential policies.

I'm not asking for political opinions/whether or you not support him. I'm just curious to see whether this sub believes his policies would result in an advantageous situation for our economy. I've been following his claims somewhat closely, and despite his ""business expertise"" I don't believe his ideas are as simple nor as positive as he claims. Then again, that's why I'm here asking for some of your opinions/ideas. 

So, what are your thoughts on if Trump's policies are carried out? Would you feel more comfortable investing if Trump was president than you would if Clinton was?

I think after it lost about 8% over the past few weeks, it could be the real winner in the markets losses. The company never seems to disappoint and continues to pay out investors handsomely for a long play with them. They are a company of a future and I don't think I have felt this confident about a position at this price before (694 yesterday). I would love to hear some opinions on this play from you all.

16-05-05,4hzy63,Please ELI5: A question on Index Funds,"Hi everybody,

I read a few book on investing, mostly of the Bogleheads type. I get it that Index funds are supposed to be the best way to invest for people that have limited knowledge, but a few things bother me and I was wondering if somebody could help me clear things up.

1) When a crash happen, most people get scared and sell. Thus, stock prices fall. Thus, the share prices of the index funds fall too. 

2) When the share prices of a fund fall very low, fund owners can decide to close the fund. Share owners get their money back (at the current share price) and the fund disappear.

If the two points above are true, then it might mean that index funds cannot protect you from crashes, and that you will lose your value just like the people that sell because they are scared, even if you didn't sell.

Is my understanding correct?

Thanks for your help!

In February GOGO's stock fell over 40% as American Airlines (their 2nd largest contract I believe) said they were ending their contract with GOGO as they were approached by $VSAT with a better deal.

Lastly, [yesterday there was a buyer of 5,000 May 20th $10 puts at 1.10](http://i.imgur.com/4YTqmyP.png). I'm in the same ones from earlier this week at .75.

They have had a very strong Q1 and I expect they will beat earnings estimates by 0.15-0.18. The last 4 quarters have all been very positive. The auto industry across the board has been on a role so no surprises should come tomorrow.

They were beaten down a bit by losing a portion of next generation GM business, but that is still 3 years out from production, so it won't effect tomorrow's call.

16-05-05,4i04xu,Why I am leaving WSB and maybe you should too.,"Going to try and speak real here for a bit, I realize this sub likes to troll and joke, so if you just want to downvote me and call me a poor faggot, thats on you, but I'm going to try to be real here for a moment.

In my opinion, if you are here to seriously become rich, then you need to leave.  If you are here because you treat it as a hobby and like to invest some play money, then that's fine, and I'll discuss a few points as to why I believe this.

1.  There are no fucking millionaires here.  Okay, maybe a couple lurk to laugh at us, but no one seriously providing content and actually trusting the methods here became a millionaire, and if they did, they represent the smallest percent of people here, while most lose, or make ""ok"" money.

2.  Our fearless leader (Shkreli) [said it best](https://youtu.be/2PCb9mnrU1g?t=221) (watch for 1 min) when he realized at a young age that he should leave his hedge-fund job because sitting around speculating on a stock was a waste of time, which is why he started his drug company.  He even compared investing (most assuredly the type found here, not safer retirement, S&amp;P investing ect) to betting on race horses or playing poker.

3.  Unless you TRULY want to be a single dude, blowing money on hookers all your life, then you might be okay.  But if you ever wanted to settle down, have a wife, maybe a family, then you risk too much employing these methods found on WSB.  To make money here you have to risk money, to make a lot of money you have to risk a lot of money, and if you ever earned up enough to send little Billy and Mary to college, would you really bet it all at a chance for a bigger house or car?  I would hope you wouldn't.

The solution?  I think investing safely is a good way to make your money work for you, but I don't think it's any big way to safely make you money on it's own.  [Warren Buffet](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/081314/how-did-warren-buffett-get-started-business.asp) wasn't making ""yolo bets"" at age 22 because he wanted to make it big, he went to school and then worked a job, only earning his first million by age 31, THEN I'm sure he made safe calculated bets, not ""well the people on WSB told me to buy SUNE so I will"" bets.

Personally, I am going into the military as an officer starting this June, and will be making six figures by the time I decide leave at age 26 (see: [Navy Nuclear Officer Pay](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/US-Navy-Nuclear-Submarine-Officer-Salaries-E41451_D_KO8,33.htm).)  I don't spout that to gloat, I mention it because I am starting to come into the thinking that hard work is the path to success.  I hope to start a business when I get out, maybe it will make me a millionaire, maybe it won't, but I have a feeling I will be ahead of myself doing that (and maybe some of you all), than if I simply made wall street bets for five years.  Hell, even if 90% of businesses fail, I would say 10% success rate is higher than that of this sub, and those successes would continue to rise, not be risked by each WSB you make.  

Again, I reiterate, if you come here as a hobby, [like to troll with the community](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/4hgs78/im_letting_the_symbol_of_freedom_birds_select_my/) (that was my post btw), like to toss some play money around, then that's great.  But if you came here with the mindset to TRULY become successful or rich, and are looking for that by making small SUNE or DUST bets instead of focusing all of those efforts to your career, then in my opinion, it's time to move on and live life, to stop staring at stock charts all day as I have been.

Edit: Loving the good roasting I'm getting, keep it up boys, I'm sure we'll all be millionaires in the future.

Edit 2: Oh dear, it's appeared I have rustled quite a few jimmies in this thread, hope you all will be okay.",61

16-05-05,4i1u29,Daily Market Analysis,"[SPY Analysis Chart 5/5/2016](http://i.imgur.com/qP1HiAx.png)

-

Left side weekly chart. Right side daily chart. Top 2 studies used are my own proprietary ""momentum strength"" algorithms that track the moving averages and compares their rate change to the overall direction and assigns colors for strength. Green is momentum to the upside. Red is momentum to the down side yellow an indication that the rate of change has slowed and ""may"" shift. If the color bars are above the zero line then the moving averages have a positive divergence IE 7 MA is above the 10 and the 10 is above the 20..etc.

-

This week is about to come to a close and the weekly is starting to show a slowing momentum top forming. Unless we have a crazy up day tomorrow this will be confirmed for the week on both the slow and fast momentum trackers and TTM to confirm the divergence change. 

-

The downward fast momentum study (top study) on the daily chart appears to be flattening out and the blue line on the study that tracks its change is beginning to shift up and will likely produce yellow bars tomorrow. This is counter to the weekly trend so while the daily is starting to bottom and shift upward it will have downward pressure from the weekly trends and likely subdue what ever bounce we get over the next few days to be very minimal. 

-

Looks as though the SPY was saved twice this week by the 365 MA (orange line) and the 50 MA (blue line) is pushing up and will add additional support to drive the market up the next few days. There will be tons of selling pressure at the 7 MA (yellow line) and the 20 MA (red line) so the move up is likely to be limited.

-

TL:DR

Weekly trend forming a neutral to bearish signal
Daily trend forming a neutral to bullish signal but needs confirmation
Technicals show short term support at the 365 MA and 50 MA and a limited bounce is likely over the next few days

-

Result.. I wouldn't buy puts here as the market is likely going up over the next few days but I also wouldn't buy calls as the strength of any up move we have will be very limited. Chart suggests to wait a few days for a potential bounce to form and then buy puts. With the weekly momentum shifting down once the daily momentum shifts down again the move could be pretty large and produce a great opportunity to buy some puts. I will continue to post these when I get time to keep everyone up to date and provide what I think will be the best time to buy SPY/QQQ puts.",51

16-05-05,4i0c9a,Why VCs Do Not Like Equity Crowdfunding,"Quick reminder: in 2012, President Obama signed the JOBS Act and announced that American startups will now have access to the capital they need from ordinary investors. Which pretty much disrupted classical relationships between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists - latter will no longer have exclusive monopoly on this market, since for startups it will be much easier to raise enough money via equity crowdfunding. This is a great new opportunity, and I really doubt that benefirs VCs provide will be able to compete with an ability to reach for thousands of potential investors, thus not only increasing the chance of successfuly funding the project, but also getting priceless and comprehensive feedback in the process.

Now, my question is - how should VCs act now? Will they join this new stream and support it, or shall we expect them to find other ways and tools to make profit? Perhaps we are to witness birth of some sort of opposing market? Or is it just me, and venture investors will feel no significant effect whatsoever?",1

A relative invested 100K or so in a fund, through a broker, that provides VC seeding to tech companies. The group filed a form D with the SEC upon its creation. The relative had their fun and profit, but wants to cash out after 3-4 years. The broker is dodging their calls and attorney's letter. From what I understand, the broker has said they can't get their money out.

So, while this isn't dire (they're fine financially, and are not investing in any other crazy-ass ventures) I'm really interested in not letting this relative being given the run-around.

Questions: Does anyone have advice on next steps to cash out of such a group? What other questions should I be considering? Thanks.

16-05-06,4i45o2,Overnight Futures Development (05/06/2016),"In an effort to add more useful info to this sub gonna start posting some stuff about SPX/CL futures development overnight.

Here is a 5 min chart of SPX futures since yesterday's close (4PM):

http://imgur.com/cXwbtWS

We close at the purple line, so as of right now futures are down nearly 1 point. Futures have been swinging wildly and attempted to break the 2040-2042 support level; however, that support level is very strong and proved so as futures have bounced once again VERY HARD in the last 30 minutes. 

Mainly have to see the next 5 hrs play out. Futures do not like that 2040-2042 level. Today's employment data will be very important to see whether futures will be able to break this level or bounce and possibly gap up. Below is the link to an image detailing economic data coming out today:

Update: http://imgur.com/Fag0Hum

Everyone be ready for employment data coming out very soon!

*****************************************************************************************
Here is the 5 min chart of CL futures since yesterday's market close (4PM):

http://imgur.com/eodDMlo

The purple line signifies that price of /CL at market close (4PM). Oil futures have been making a nice lower highs patterns since then. Right around 1:09 EST there was a large red candle, bringing CL a leg down (I am unsure the cause of this). However, one can't discount oil's capability to go full retard. Oil is doing a great job of rebounding from its losses, and currently getting hammered by the 44.1 support (now resistance) level. Inability to break that level is good for oil shorts. All eyes are on Rig count for today.

UPDATE: http://imgur.com/YCEvbbi

Oil's done a great job of nearly erasing all losses since 4PM EST. However, as of 6:08 AM EST, it got rejected surprisingly at the purple line and now back at 44.1

*****************************************************************************************

My plays for today:

1) Currently holding put spreads out for June, will continue to hold. Plan to grab more of them if we fill the gap. I will also close my short legs if we gap up. 

2) I am currently holding DWTI - bought at 99.30 a bit before market close. It's a small position that I plan to hold for a few days, and am also holding USO put spreads. I plan to average up or down on DWTI. 

3) Continue to watch gold and its reaction to employment data. 

As a side note, gold futures (/GC) are basically flat. They close around ~1280, and gold futures are right at 1280. Even until 7:21 EST, they are still flat.

16-05-06,4i46c5,"Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC) are the Most Undervalued Stocks in the Entire Market - Here's Why","In 2008 Congress passed the Housing Economic Recovery Act.  This legislation gave the government the power to take control of the Government Sponsored Enterprises, or GSEs, if certain threshold criteria were met and their regulator made a determination that intervention was needed to restore operations at the companies.

Approximately 3 months after HERA passed, the Treasury secretary at the time, Hank Paulson, made the decision in consultation with the president, George W. Bush, to takeover operations of the companies and to place them into conservatorship.  In his book 'On the Brink' he characterizes his mentality in making the decision by recalling a conversation he had with the president just before taking control of the enterprises.    The quote is ""Do they know it's coming, Hank?"" President Bush asked me. ""Mr. President,"" I said, ""we're going to move quickly and take them by surprise. The first sound they'll hear is their heads hitting the floor.""  To read a more in-depth excerpt of the decision:  http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Books/book-excerpt-brink-henry-paulson-jr/story?id=9713451

The major problem with the attitude displayed in that quote is that these companies had, and continue to have, investors.  Their shares are publicly traded.  So while the goal of protecting the economy and taxpayers is very noble, shareholder's in these companies have taken an almost total loss in the value of investments.  Fannie Mae, for instance, has been profitable for 17 consecutive quarters(4 years, 3 months), yet still remains in government control.

Within the next 6 weeks, an appeals court is expected to make a decision in relation to the legality of the present arrangement.  Their conservator, FHFA (Federal Housing Finance Agency), signed an agreement, normally referred to as the '3rd Amendment', that gives their net worth to the Treasury Department forever.  22 lawsuits are challenging the legality of that agreement.  

The Treasury Department GSE Game Plan:

1.  Get Congress to pass HERA 
2.  Use the financial crisis as an excuse to take over the GSEs and put them into conservatorship
3.  Fire the managers and reconstitute the boards of directors with cronies
4.  Delist the companies
5.  Force the GSEs to borrow capital from Treasury at 10 percent interest in the lowest interest rate enviornment in history, AAA credit ratings, and 400 billion dollars in unencombered and unpledged MBS.  Also deny them access to the discount window at the FED while simultaneously telling the public that they have access to the discount window at the FED.
6.  Use Fannie and Freddie to buy up bad mortgage assets from banks at a rate of ""50 billion dollars per month""
7   Encourage NEW public investment in GSE preferred stock and then abuse those good faith patriotic investments by never paying the promised dividends on those investments. (22 billion in preferred stock sold in 2007-8)
8.  Give GSE profits to Treasury forever
9.  Aggressively fight GSE shareholder lawsuits even when 100 percent in the wrong
10. Abuse trust in government by having Congressmen and women introduce unconstitutional GSE reform legislation like Corker/Warner, the Path Act, and Pay Back the Taxpayers etc.
11.  Put the auditors of the GSEs, like Deloitte, in a precarious situation by allowing them to be sued and endangering their investors.  
12. Have the Justice Department claim executive privilege, and other privileges, on 11,000 documents having nothing at all to do with protecting national security or trade secrets.  
13. Encourage Justice Department lawyer's to make a mockery of the legal system by making ridiculous and asinine arguments on behalf of the United States in courtrooms around the country.  Have them act extremely arrogant and disrespect the judges, like Judge Sweeney.  
14. Make a mockery of conservatorship by drawing out the process for 8 years and 17 consecutive quarters of profitability.

I own common stock in Fannie Mae(FNMA), which currently trades at a price of 1.77 share and market cap of 10.16 billion.  That market cap includes an option the Treasury Department has to purchase 79.9 percent of the common stock for .000001 per share.  That option has not been exercised yet, but it makes sense in valuing the company to assume it will be exercised even if there is a possibility that it won't be.  

Historically, Fannie Mae, traded with a P/E ratio of between 15-20 times earnings.  So the probable market cap of the company out of conservatorship after being relisted would probably be somewhere between 150-200 billion.  It is worth noting that the GSEs have doubled their Guarantee fees which has probably doubled their overall profitability.  There are 1.2 billion shares outstanding for Fannie Mae.  20 percent of 200 billion is 40 billion.  

Which means that the shares of Fannie Mae out of conservatorship should be worth $33.33 per share, at minimum.  If the common stock warrant that Treasury holds is never exercised the shares would be worth 165 dollars per share.  That's almost 100 times their current market price.  

Here are the current positive factors that make it unlikely you can lose money holding these shares long term.  But even better the situation is binary which means because there are no in-between investment results possible besides the shares going to 33 or 165, that the share prices are vastly under-valued presently.

1.  22 lawsuits pending and very damaging information coming out in documents in those lawsuits.
2.  An appeals court decision within the next 6 weeks
3.  Very positive media coverage recently.  Rolling Stone, New York Times, The Washington Post, all are on the story and telling it in ways that are great for shareholder's
4. The GSEs have paid over 240 billion dollars to the Treasury on borrowings of 187 billion.  
5. The GSEs are involved with almost 90 percent of mortgages in the United States.  This makes replacing them arbitrarily or quickly extremely challenging. 
6. They are operating with very low amounts of retained capital.  This makes it likely that a decision will have to be made soon that changes the current circumstances.
7. Very vocal grassroots investors movement.
8.  Large hedge fund investments in the companies.
9.  Best law firms in the country fighting our lawsuits
10.Election risk for the democrats.  If a republican gets elected president they might lose the ability to control the outcome for the housing market and housing market groups, which are big political supporters and contributors.

Recently Judge Sweeny in the Court of Federal Claims unsealed some documents related to 3rd Amendment profit sweep decision.  Susan McFarland, the then CFO of Fannie Mae,  says that she told Treasury before the 3rd Amendment sweep that the GSEs were in a sustainable profitability based on her projections.  She also told them that it was possible in the near future that they would be able to release their tax deferred assets.  She even speculates that her report to Treasury might have been the reason that Treasury instituted the 3rd amendment.  Here is the excerpt from her deposition:

Q. (BY MR. THOMPSON) Did you think it was the
20 effective nationalization of the companies?

21 MR. LAUFGRABEN: Objection; form.

22 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Objection; form.

23 A. No, I didn't view it as nationalizing. It
24 borders on that; I can see.
25 But I had, shortly before that, had
45
1 a meeting with Treasury whereby we reviewed our
2 forecasts. I had expressed a view that I believed we
3 were now in a sustainable profitability, that we would
4 be able to deliver sustainable profits over time. I
5 even mentioned the possibility that it could get to a
6 point in the not-so-distant future where the factors
7 might exist whereby the allowance on the
8 deferred tax asset would be released. We were not there
9 yet, but, you know, you could see positive things
10 occurring.
11 So when the amendment went into place,
12 part of my reaction was they did that in response to my
13 communication of our forecasts and the implication of
14 those forecasts, that it was probably a desire not to
15 allow capital to build up within the enterprises and not
16 to allow the enterprises to recapitalize themselves

All signs point to this situation being resolved before a new president takes office.  The time to buy the stock is now. (in my opinion)  ",51

16-05-06,4i65qi,Thoughts on $DATA?,"The recent drop got me looking at this stock and I have to say a lot of the data from the recent earnings report look pretty good.  I see a lot of the concern is revolving around their declining profit margins and increased operating costs but at the same time cash-on-hand is increasing and the bulk of the inflated operating costs were tied up in Marketing/ R&amp;D.  

Some positive highlights I sifted through the earnings:

* 47% increase in Marketing 
* &gt;95% of increased operating costs are from Marketing/R&amp;D that could pay dividends in the coming quarters.
* increased cash-on-hand 13% increase, gives them flexibility to dump more money into marketing and potential acquisitions.
* better net operating margins (-3.5% vs -8% in 2015)


Some of the negatives:

* increased net loss
* decreased profit margins (-20% vs -12% in 2015)

My thoughts are that in general the company is losing money, but the increased spending in marketing and a fairly good control of general operating expenses and cash-in-hand seem to be positive signs for future growth.  I've personally heard people talking about their products where we're starting to work more with Big Data and I know a lot of clients are looking at it too.

Wondering what everyone else's views on it are.

I am considering the opportunity of investing some cash into XTI aircraft (currently investments are on hold since the company has to do some paperwork for SEC). Here are my reasons to do it:

* XTI aircraft might change the way we fly - vertical takeoff and landing is what the humanity always desired. With such airplane one can easily land almost everywhere, so you do not need runways anymore!
* Huge market - personal aircraft transportation seems only to grow in the future, and it is obvious that many CEOs and billionaires will desire such a jet, which can be used not only for a long-distance transportation BUT even for regular commutes
* If technology is a success they might go further to the mass-market and who knows - they might even be the next Tesla of the aircraft industry.

However, I feel like I have a lack of knowledge in the sector, and I could miss something important, what do you think about it, guys? Is XTI aircraft worth investing? (Investments are temporary on hold )",8

 After placing the order, my Positions page listed the company Symbol, the quantity of shares, and the market value of said shares. I made my first trade!

 Except then the company did a reverse stock split and now I'm a bit confused. Firstly, the company Symbol has changed to a numeric value that's 9 digits long. Secondly, the quantity of shares that it's listing on my Positions page doesn't appear to be updated. I understand that in a stock split the number of shares I have would be divided by the ratio of the stock split (1:7), but that isn't being reflected via my broker.

16-05-06,4i6gex,Could someone please ELI5 whether this is a bad idea?,"A friend of mine came up with a novel stock strategy:

1. Pick high volume, high volatility stock (e.g., FCX).
2. Simultaneously buy and short said stock (buy 100 shares, short 100 shares).
3. Stop-loss the bad pick (e.g., if share price drops, sell the shares you bought) at 1%, with the assumption that the trend continues at least briefly.
4. Close the good pick for profit on 100 shares.

Example:

* FCX trades at $12/share.
* Friend simultaneously buys 100 shares for $1200 and shorts 100 shares for $1200.
* Share price drops. At $11.88, stop loss sell kicks in, and friend sells 100 shares @ $1188.
* Share price drops again. At $11.76, friend closes short sale, buying back 100 shares @ $1176.
* Profit: $12 minus transaction fees and interest on the short


It seems ~~foolproof~~ marketproof to me, which is an instant red flag. If it really was marketproof, someone would probably have gotten famous from doing it.

16-05-06,4i5fpc,AMC vs CKEC,"I have owned AMC for around a month and am looking to hold long. I don't have a price target, but I like their prospects with increasing concessions sales and more movies with huge draws slated for the near future (namely the Marvel universe, Star Wars, and hopefully more Jurassic Park). I am very interested in Carmike Cinemas as well. I think they are undervalued, but it's always harder to tell with those that aren't turning profit.

For background, Carmike had been trading at around $25 a share until the news of a potential AMC merger at $30/share came out, which immediately boosted the stock to around 30. The current climate at CKEC is one of discontent. Most shareholders want between $33 and low 40s for their shares. I see this as a potential risk for AMC (the $30/share deal will cost approx. $1.1b, most of which is debt-financed, so a raise will be costly).

Basically at this point I am trying to weigh whether the buyout, which will make AMC the largest cinema chain in the world and thus give it better leverage for revenue splits, while unlocking monster southeast potential from CKEC and eliminating most of the support services of Carmike and rolling it under the AMC roof will be worth the potentially higher price of the merger. If the Justice Department clears the merger, AMC would likely have to close between 8 and 15 cinemas, which is a pretty negligible number. Anyone have any advice on how to gauge this? (I'm a noob)

EDIT: My options are as follows:

1. Hold AMC, which is probably what I should do if I think the merger will go through at $30/share or the deal falls through altogether.

2. Hold AMC, buy CKEC, which may be an awful plan, I'm sort of new to this. I would probably do this if I think Carmike shareholders will get paid $35 or better, netting me a 16.67% return over what would probably be about the rest of the year (per both boards' timelines)

3. Dispose of AMC at an ordinary, but negligible gain, buy CKEC. This would likely be if I thought CKEC shares will be paid $35+ and I think the cost of the merger will outweigh the benefit for AMC over the duration of my holding or to the point that I can rebuy for cheaper than I have now after a Carmike payout.",3

16-05-06,4i5x3r,Crude Oil Theory/DD,"Been watching Crude Oil futures very closely for a couple weeks now ever since I made a bunch on DWTI it peaked my interest (No longer trade DWTI switched to USO options). Been following all the news each day, American inventory updates and watching the intraday price changes.

From a fundamental standpoint, oil really has no reason to be at $45 right now. There is a massive oversupply, OPEC countries are threating to boost production, and America's inventory keeps going up, but Crude oil doesn't give a shit about bearish news sure it might drop a little but never too much, but as soon as a little bull news comes out (Canadian Wild Fire, Kuwait Strike) the futures start going up. 

I feel like most of you guys don't read, but I do sometimes and I did happen to read Reminiscences of a Stock Operator it's about Jesse Livermore one of the best traders of all time. In this book, he mentions time and time again when a commodity is acting irrationally that almost always means there is manipulation from a big time player. Now I know this book is old as shit but it's not like inside buying and manipulation stopped existing.

My theory is every time there is bull news said players buy up a bunch of stock to get a rally going then once everyone hops on their job is done. When there is bearish news they try to stop oil futures from dropping too much by buying enough to stabilize it. 

If this is true eventually they will reach a point where they think they have raised the price enough to make a good profit and sell off a good portion of their position dropping the stock a good bit so they need some room to work with, $45 or anything higher seems like a good time to me with plenty of space for a profit if they bought a lot of futures at the last dip at the last dip.

So my theory is we could see a pretty big drop off if the price goes to %50 or stays around $45

16-05-06,4i5z7f,Oil Momentum Analysis,"Everyone wants to yolo oil so here is what I think will happen.. While fundamentals suggest oil should be much lower, technicals right now are short term neutral to bullish. It bounced off of the 20 DMA twice in the last few weeks with strong support each time and still has slight upward momentum propping it up.


[Chart](http://i.imgur.com/itdPTVj.png)


Momentum suggests that oil will trade flat to up over the next couple of days/weeks with a bias to the upside due to the weekly trend. 20 DMA (red line right chart) is supporting it up while the 365 DMA (orange line right chart) appears to be acting as resistance. My expectations are for oil to trade in this range while it narrows and up to the 365 DMA and probably pierce it and tag the $47-$48 range before finally falling again. After that we need to confirm the new down trend with a close below its 20DMA as a good indication that oil has gone bearish again. If you want to chance timing the top then short oil at $47-$48 or wait for confirmation when it finally closes below its 20 DMA",9

85 puts ($20 below where Disney is now) are $1.15. Over twice as expensive as the equivalent calls.

The same is true of 120 calls/90 puts. 120 calls are $.96, 90 puts are $1.80, nearly twice as expensive.

I have found the same is true of several totally different stocks.

16-05-07,4i7yjt,"I know I'm not supposed to make a post asking for advice, but this is a once-in-a-lifetime situation and I really don't want to blow it.","Hi everyone,

Long-time lurker, infrequent poster. I'm writing this from a throwaway, of course. I've seen, first-hand, a huge amount of helpful advice dispensed on this sub over the last few years. I'd be SO appreciative if anyone would be willing to throw some my way, because I don't really have anyone in my life with whom I can discuss my financial situation. 

I'm 26 years old, living in NYC. I have a freelance job doing digital marketing for a Fortune 100 company. The company that employs me has the contract for another 5 years. I'll make anywhere from $80-100k per year, possibly more as time passes (assuming I keep the job). As of last week, I had about $180k in liquid assets.

Last week, a wealthy family member gave me a $500k loan, to be paid back interest-free in five years. I didn't ask for this loan - it was offered to me on a whim. I'm an amateur investor. I first read ""Beating the Street"" when I was 12 years old, and have been pretty active in the market ever since. My passion for investing is well known, and I hope to one day soon be able to focus on investing full-time. Over the last ten years, I've primarily been on getting my life off the ground, as most of us have to do, but I think it's finally time to turn the corner. 

I know that so far, this is a pretty basic windfall story, so the proper advice would be to probably just stick it in index funds, take what i make, and run with it. What makes my situation different is that three years ago, I had an opportunity to invest in a super-duper small (&lt;$1M revenue) cpg company that I thought had a ton of potential. Essentially, as I had hoped, the company has really blown up over the last three years. Their e-commerce growth is off the charts, they're landing major retailers left and right, and making major inroads in a massive market. I currently own 9.47% of all outstanding shares of a company that was most recently valued at $25m (four months ago for a small cash raise) and is now probably closer to $30m because sales have been stronger than expected. They're going to net around $2M this year, but they're not going to pay dividends because we all think it's best if it's reinvested. But they're a bit older than me and anxious to make some money, so next year at the latest I'll start receiving dividend checks at an incredible 75/25 ratio. According to projections, I'll receive around $350k next year, and I'm hoping that number will continue to rise in the years to come - and of course I have good reason to believe it will, though I don't take anything for granted. 

This investment has been a total secret. Only my girlfriend knows about it, besides the people (two of my friends) that are directly involved, but they're keeping it under wraps as well. 

Sorry for the long backstory, but I wanted to provide as much information as I possibly could to give context. 

I have no idea what to do now. Half of me wants to quit my job, but I know I shouldn't. I'm fortunate to not have to be on call during business hours, so I could theoretically work when the market is closed and focus solely on trading when it's open. I'm in a position of unique leverage and I want to maximize it, which is why I'm coming to you guys. I'm not asking for any specific stock advice, of course, but more for a discussion about what others would do if they found themselves in my situation. If you could take two minutes to think about how I should optimize my time, books I should read, software I should learn, anything at all, it would be GREATLY appreciated. As I said in the title, I'm not willing to mess this up. Thank you for reading, and thanks in advance for any responses. 

TL;DR: 26 y/o, making 80k/yr t stable job, had 180k in liquid assets. Received 5-year 500k interest-free loan from family member, also have roughly $3 million worth of equity invested in a profitable business that will start paying large dividends in 2017. What would you do in my situation to leverage your position?

16-05-07,4ibgcm,"Trying to find secured line of credit for RE deals, not hard money.","I am a smallish developer, some flips, some new build, some rentals, all projects successful, some returning as high as 80%.  My portfolio is 65% leveraged.  I have 3 large projects coming up, a 750k TH complex, one 8plex requiring 1.2M, and one early stage 20-plex.  As an example, the 750k project will return about 90%+ to me in 8 months (ARV 2.1M, I own the land which cost 300k). 

I have a too-small network of investors who invest at 8% APR per project and then rely on hard money (typically 12% after points) or my own cash for the rest.  I have been looking for a model that is essentially a line of credit, say 3M, that I agree to use within certain parameters.  I'd probably pay 10%.  What I want to avoid is bank / construction loans, which I find untenable because of the delays in getting draws.  I want to plow forward.  I also want flexibility to buy and sell fast (extremely minimal underwriting)and have lots of cash flexibility.  I'm happy to give deeds of trust on each project (though sometimes it's just land) and personal guarantees, etc.

So my question-- Is there a market somewhere in between banks (low interest, high hassle) and hard money (high interest, moderate hassle).  For what its worth, I have 800+ credit and about 1M of my own cash I invest in these things.  I have a partner as well, and we have a ""captive"" construction company (we don't own it but contract for 100% of their time). Any advice, even if it's where to go ask questions, is appreciated.

Legit?,"I've got an opportunity to get put my money in the hands of a guy who has a record of investing that sounds pretty good. While most people say ""you can't beat the market"" and that even professionals generally don't- this manager beat the market by 3% over 20 years (up to a few years ago- when his returns declined, averaging something a little over 2% annually in almost 25 years of investing).

After lackluster performance for a few years which made me think twice (this guy is a contrarian if I've ever seen one), I missed the boat on a closed fund they had offered. It's up 76% in one year.   That is not a typo. 76% in one year, around 150% in two years.  Granted, he had a rough couple years during this period (coming off lows with 50% loss!).

Is this too good to be true? Generally, only HNW people can get in on these funds, but lucky for me this guy is my god mother married this guy several years back, and he's to let me in. Thoughts?",48

One way I like to search for new stocks is by reading comments on Stock Twitz for stocks I'm following. I've noticed many people will post recommendations of other stock that's similar to what I'm following, or stocks that are ""hot"". 

As of now I only invest in penny stocks that are a dollar or less, and my favorite website I occasionally check is [stocksunder1.org](http://stocksunder1.org). It tracks penny stocks that have made the most gain in a day, and then look up and follow some of these stocks on Stock Twitz, and from there may discover new stock through comments again. 

The last way I search for new stocks is through google searching articles and news on penny stocks. I've found lots of scammy and fake websites so I tend to stick with verified and trusted sources like market watch, yahoo finance, Wall Street Journal, Reuters, etc.

I'd like to know how some of you search for and discover new stocks that look promising or keeping an eye on until it's time to buy. Are there similar services to Stock Twitz that you find better? What are some ways you search for and track new stocks? Thank you!",27

16-05-08,4idbuk,"Trying to decide which tech stocks to prioritize buying while they're low: AAPL, WDC, INTC, MSFT","I have read the four companies' financial statements and their most recent activities. All four of them took a beating during the earnings week, and AAPL and WDC might appear to be falling knives.

WDC, INTC, and MSFT are all tied to the somewhat stagnant PC market. I believe WDC is going to have a better shot at improving than Seagate due to having an SSD market presence, but both HDD and SSD are going to be less profitable as the price per GB of SSDs continues to decline. I don't expect WDC to flop over and go bankrupt anytime down the road though.

AAPL appears to have some problems with getting people exicted about their new products, and there's some uncertainty with the upcoming iPhone 7. They do have a significant amount of assets, securities holdings and cash in their offshore accounts, which could be used if Apple really gets desperate.

My end goal? Buy and hold, but I'd like to have the opportunity of buying them at a discount (I could wait until a recession hits, but timing that is almost impossible without extensive economic/financial knowledge and homework).

EDIT: TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg, aka TSMC) is another stock that I'm considering.

16-05-08,4iepv3,Core Four Questions,"Hi all,

New to investing and I've been lurking trying to learn as much as I can.  I've decided that a Lazy Portfolio Core Four start up kit approach sounds like a good starting point. I recently maxed out my 2015 and 2016 Vanguard Roth IRA contributions for a total of $11,000 which is now sitting in a MM fund doing nothing. My bond allocation will be 25%. 

If it matters, I have a traditional 401(k) through Fidelity that has 100% allocation into their Target Retirement 2055 fund.

Question 1:

Each of the Core Four funds (VBMFX, VTSMX, VGTSX, VGSIX) have a $3,000 minimum investment.  Because I only have $11,000 in my IRA, which one of the four should be on the taxable side?  I've read that Stocks and Stock funds generate lower taxes, but after that I'm lost with my limited knowledge.

Question 2:

How does TIPS fit into this?  I've read about people doing a ""modified"" core four where they replace REIT with TIPS.  Doesn't that increase your bond allocation?  Please help decipher these hieroglyphics!

Once again, this is all very new to me.  If I did not provide enough information, or asked a question that doesn't make sense please let me know and I will do my best to clarify.

Thanks again for reading! 

EDIT: Core four funds recommended by Rick Ferri are as follows:

Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSMX) ER 0.17%
Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund (VGTSX) ER 0.22%
Vanguard REIT Index Fund Investor Shares 	(VGSIX) ER 0.24%

Either use a stop loss 

The downside with this is, you might have 10 consecutive losses. If thats at 10%, youd have lost around 65% of your total value.

Or 

Use a max allocation cap.


I prefer the max allocation cap because it allows you to reduce your risk by being able to capture dividends over time and you have a defined amount of risk to your trade.

In every trade your max loss is 100%. The dividend offsets max loss by paying you out over time. You are also able to convert your position to a covered call.",0

(i) you have no idea who the responders are - their track record, their intentions (pump and dump?), their biases, risk tolerance, blind spots etc. 

(ii) if you buy a recommendation from the internet you will have no idea when to sell, and you won't have conviction in the idea - so if it falls 10% or more, you won't have a valuation to check against to see if the market is being rational or irrational. 

(iii) you won't learn anything this way. Read about investment styles, portfolio construction, valuation, market psychology for yourself and you'll have a shot at not failing miserably. 

Picking stocks anyway that doesn't involve heroic effort is unfortunately just gambling and you WILL lose eventually. Investing (actively) well is exceptionally difficult, and anyone who tells you otherwise either doesn't get it, or is selling you something. Either way, you should ignore them.

16-05-09,4ihm1f,Dividend investing,"I'm looking for some good books on how to get started in this type of investing. 

Background: I'm a college student and I've been fortunate enough to attend a college where I'm able to attend and not have student loans which leaves me the option of spending my meager income on entertainment and other things. I want to start learning how to invest wisely. I've been following finance blogs and investing related things for a while now. I've finally decided on a type of investing that I think will work for me. One that seems safe enough and works to provide me with a ""passive income"". 

So I'm wondering about any good books that I could get to help me dive into this deeper to gain an understanding before I go and actually invest in the stock market. ",4
16-05-08,4igasq,Apple will rise from the ashes this week.,"Everyone hates aapl, I know. This is when you should buy. ""aapl stock is tanking!"" you've been hearing that a lot lately. Well guess what last week aapl lost a whopping %1.09 and the s&amp;p was down for the week. 

The pessimism surrounding this stock reminds me a lot of the pessimism that surrounded DIS a few months ago. Everyone was an expert on ESPN and it's woes, now DIS is on a ramp up. 

You all know about aapl's cash, you all know they make billions and billions of dollars in profit. You all know it's down 30% from it's highs. With the raised dividend and drop in price aapl is starting to look pretty good to those whimpy income investors. 

Monday will be a big day for aapl one way or another, a measly 1% gain would wipe out last week's losses. 1% down would break ""support""  and possibly make people hesitant on pulling the trigger. 

The way I see it investors had all week to price in the results from last earnings, and at the end of the week the stock was barely down.

I have may 20 $93 calls my play is hit a bounce this week and sell if/when aapl hits 94-96. Last week I made money on $94 calls and I'm back for more. Bonus aapl options are super liquid, so you're not down 10% right out of the gate like many other companies. 

Disclaimer: You may lose some or all of your money buying aapl stock and/or options.

EDIT. Bonus fun fact. That that Carl Icahn guy, famous investor, who apparently sold off all his aapl stock and had to tell the world all about his genius decision. Yeah his fund's results for last couple years are as follows. 


Down 20.6% in 2014

Down 34.1% in 2015

And off to a great start in 2016 with down 9.9%

He should be a mod here if he isn't already

Edit  

OK apparently Icahns fund is currently paying a $6.00 annual dividend which is almost 11% at the moment. I don't know what it paid in 2014 or 2015 but I guess his losses aren't as awful as I previously said, considering the dividend. Still really bad though, see comments for a quick calculation I did.

Reading further about investing I keep hearing that a company's share price is a reflection of the cumulative knowledge about that company. So why do people on here read financial statements and look at P/E ratios etc.? Surely all that has already been factored into the price by huge investment banks doing very complicated analyses on the company.

When buying a share, aren't you effectively saying that you know more than the average investor because, by buying it, you must think it's undervalued or that the company will do well in future. But obviously you don't have access to this extra information, so isn't it just gambling?

16-05-08,4igj71,"In a unique situation, looking for actual advice that runs counter to the personal finance conservative circlejerk","Hi, 

This is a new throwaway - I wasn't well received in /r/investing last week. It's practically like /r/personalfinance over there, and when I stressed my appetite for risk, I was strung out like a pariah. Apparently young+wealthy+risk-taking personality is greatly frowned upon over there. I hope I've found the right place. 

Here's my situation: 25 years old, no debt, freelance work from home and don't have to be available during business hours (just have to submit assignments by deadlines, so I can work when the market is closed). 125k pretax income, 200k in liquid assets, ~2M in illiquid assets that I'm not willing to touch for another five years. I just received what I thought was a 500k loan from a VERY rich (~700m, according to various internet estimates) family member, but it turns out it was a birthday present (I turn 26 next week). He threw me off the scent by gifting it a few weeks early under the guise of an interest-free loan. He told me he wasn't sure if i'd accept it if i knew it was a gift. He clearly doesn't know me very well.

So yeah, that's my situation. Nobody knows about my net worth because I've kept it a secret. I'm not going to quit my job because I can focus on the market from 9:30 - 4 and do all of my work, no problem. 

I see this as a free 500k, and I'm willing to take as many risks as possible. People don't (or won't?) understand that risk is pretty essential to making serious money, unless you're looking at a 40-year timeline or whatever. I honestly don't care at all if I lose all of this money, because my situation is still great and I will take any opportunity to get ahead when I see value, even if I lose. 

I haven't done much technical trading since high school because I got distracted with college/post-college life, but I've been active in the market since I was 12 years old and have a really solid understanding of most underlying fundamentals. I'm in a stage where I'm looking to absorb as much information as possible, and I'd really appreciate it if someone would take the time to look at my situation. I'm obviously not looking for specific stock advice or anything like that - I just value other people's perspectives because I know that they expand my own, and there are obviously a lot of smart, driven people on this sub.

16-05-08,4igjjy,What is the best place to buy gold?,"Hello everyone!

As many of you know, the gold price is on the rise and I think it won't stop for a while. And in these insecure times, I would really like to get myself some gold, and I mean real PHYSICAL gold. So my question for you is how do I do this the best and cheapest way? As I live in Norway I don't think I'll go outside Europe to get the gold. I've looked at Bitgold, but I'm kind of sceptical. They promise a price within 1% of the price and I think you're able to get that in physical gold if you pick it up in one of the vaults. Has anyone got any experience with this?",0
16-05-08,4igkvb,Watch List: Day trades and Swing trades,"NEM: If the market decides to go back up I am looking at a short on NEM which is a gold stock that's been ripping. 161.8% or 176.3% extension on the daily combined with some fib retracements from high to low. It will just be a quick trade since I think if the market keeps rolling over NEM should keep moving towards a measured move around 41.50 area.


AHS: Nice daily chart. Although a bit extended it could breakout a bit more or if market tanks could setup a nice failed breakout short back to 34.00.


DFT: Another very strong one on the daily. Right around new 52 week high breakout level. Could see 47.00


WCN: Another stock just hit a 138 extension and pulled back sharply. I am looking for a bounce back to 67.00 and then if it holds a move towards 70 for the 161.8 extension


MLM may be setup for a nice short on a breakout failure. It's right at breakout level on the daily so might breakout although it's pretty extended since it went straight up since bottoming in early Feb.


AWK water stock that's been super strong. I am looking to short it on any sudden spike, possible 76.50-77.50 area.


DLR same sort of chart. Near a 52 week high and breakout level on daily. Kind of extended but may continue towards 97 or 101. This one could also setup a nice short as well if it's a false breakout.


NOC: Last one for a short is. It's been supper strong. 5 up days in a row on decreasing volume. Just hit 2.5 standard deviations bollinger bands on daily. Definitely higher priced so not for everyone's liking but should give a nice trade.

16-05-08,4igs3k,Portfolio Strategy - Buy High Sell Low,"I am not new to investing, been in the market for many years. I have a portfolio built over time which consists of primarily index funds. I have slimmed it down recently so that it is a fairly simple set of investment vehicles. 

I also have about 33% of the portfolio in individuals stocks. This is a significant amount of $'s. I have approximately 30 stocks across 10 industries. I have a goal of 3 stocks per industry, but it does vary by industry. The individual stocks re generally all dividend growth type issues. I work extremely hard to not time the market but do trade into these stocks on a monthly basis. I have a policy of not selling anything within 18 months of purchase so I have to be pretty solid on buy decisions. The time horizon for this portion of the portfolio is approximately 13 years.

Recently, with valuations at seemingly nose bleed levels I am beginning to think about changing the way I add to the individual stock portion of the portfolio and looking for feedback.

I am considering using the $'s I can add into the portfolio each month and only considering for purchase the stocks that are down the most at the given time of purchase (usually around the 18-20 of each month). This would certainly make the decision of where to add each month much more straightforward. Also would enforce a buy low mind set. Potentially set me up for greater returns down the line. I only buy in lots that keep my commission &lt; %1 of the purchase. 

I am struggling with how to remove as much emotion from capital infusions as possible while also not doing anything stupid. 

Assuming I have done my Due Diligence and feel comfortable with the long term outlook of the individual companies what reasons should I not handle new buys as described ? Can anyone give me guidance into how they handle this situation ? 

Hopefully this post can lead to good discussion about ways that people manage longer term portfolios of individual stocks. ",5

Along with Laplanche, three other senior managers have been let go.

Company President Scott Sanborn will be acting CEO, and board member Hans Morris has assumed the newly-created role of executive chairman.

The company last month repurchased the loans at par and resold them to another investor. The financial impact was minor.

As to operations, operating revenue of $151.3M was up 87% Y/Y, and adjusted EBITDA of $25.2M gained 137%. Adjusted EPS of $0.05 vs. $0.02.Originations of $2.75B up 68% Y/Y.

My new employer only offers Fidelity funds, company matches 50% up to $2000. I understand from lurking on this subreddit that Fidelity has much higher fees- because of this, I'm unsure if I should rollover my 401k or keep it separate.

Accredited investors have additional options in the payout, and so I am wondering if I could consider the stock I already own towards the 1M assets requirement. Before the announcement, it was valued at &lt;1M but since we are now in the window between the announcement (where a new FMV is known) and the closing, can I use the new FMV to calculate the value of stock I already own as part of my assets.  Since I own them from exercising, and the pre-acquisition value is an underestimate, and out dated, my argument is that the new FMV more accurately reflects of the current value of the stock, and these are assets I own now, prior to closing.

Do you think that is a reasonable argument and that I would be an accredited investor?

The night before I spent all night researching analyst predictions, monitoring trade volumes, talking to international personnel, and I bought. I told the risk manager and he bertstared me but I showed him all my research and he gave me the go ahead. Said that as long as I play it safe to hedge risk by taking an equal and opposite position in the market. I went with my gut instinct and made $3.5 million dollars in one single trade for the firm. I was baby faced and wearing my first ever pinstripe when I did. I was cheered in the office like the General of the British Army after returning from war and sent home at midday. The next day, there was a $1200 watch, a silk tie with silver cufflinks and a business card from the CFO waiting at my desk who was going to take me out to dinner. At the dinner, he paid for a $200 steak and $500 bottle of wine, and we ate in one of the finest restaurants in London in Mayfair. He then presented me a bonus cheque and told me that I have a bright future ahead of me. But most importantly, I won the respect of people in the office. Apart from a poverty intern, I was the youngest person. People thought of me as a joke. Just like I do with the new kid now. Nobody talked to me, people asked me to make their coffee, I was just a paperboy. But after that 1 trade, ONE SINGLE TRADE, seniors in the office greeted me good morning, people asked my day, the receptionist set me up with her friend on nights out, I didn't pay for a single round of drinks until the day I left! I felt like Denzel Washington on a film set.

I'll never forget that day for the rest of my life, and things like that just don't happen in other professions. I honestly feel like i'm rotting away my life whenever I leave Central London. If I was an American, i'd live in Manhattan because outside of the big city, i'd feel lost. I'd feel depressed. I'd feel no purpose or challenge or excitement.",1

16-05-10,4inikk,Question about understanding options/strike prices,"I've been studying options for a little bit of time and trying to gain some understanding by playing with stock simulations.  I've been drawn to options by their inherent risk/reward, but there's a couple of things I can't wrap my head around.

The biggest thing that I've been searching for an answer to, and would help me a lot right now, is knowing *when* an option earns money.  For example, stock ZZZ's current price is $10.  There's a call option for ZZZ at a strike price of $20, and the option has an ask price of $0.01.  I buy 1 call contract at the $20 strike (1 x 100 x 0.01 = $1 cost, correct?) expecting the stock to rise, and wait.  

This is where my understanding drops off.  Does ZZZ's stock price have to rise *above* $20 *before* I see any profit?  Or, if ZZZ's stock price rises, which has the effect of also raising the bid price of the $20 call (if my understanding is correct), can I sell my call before hitting the $20 mark and see a profit?

I guess my question boils down to:  does a call (or a put, for that matter) have to necessarily reach its strike price to turn a profit for the buyer?",2
16-05-10,4injh9,Question about Target Retirement on Vanguard,"Hello everyone, I'm looking to set-up my Roth IRA account. This part has me very confused, and reading all these articles has me more confused so I just need to ask. I keep seeing all of these things about $8.00 a trade, etc. So how does this apply to the Target Retirement Portfolio you choose on Vanguard based on when you want to retire (if I was to choose Vanguard)? Does it charge you several eight dollar fees or whatever on how many trades it needs to make? 

I figured I should also ask, this is an iffy one. A lot of the money I have is money I made when I was quite young as a musician. So, tax issues. Should I just be prepared to have issues or should I send the money in, then pay the taxes for it now? When I say young, I mean teenaged years. I'm early twenties now. 

Finally, as I consider other companies, are these portfolio options common in other companies? Thank you!",3

16-05-09,4il962,Interesting Observation on Lending Club Notes [$LC],"Given the recent news on Lending Club and its internal controls (or lack thereof), I started doing some investigation on notes available to investors. I've been investing at Lending Club since January, both through notes and in LC stock. I have a history of employment in the financial industry and have high hopes that P2P lending is the way of the future. That being said, what I found out today was rather disheartening.

While I should have maybe done more for due diligence, what I discovered may not be a surprise to some. In this morning's news regarding Lending Club notes and specifically the situation that prompted the resignation of Laplanche, it was disclosed that $22 million in loans had been sold to a investor against the investor's ""express instructions."" Now, this may not sound interesting, but LendingClub is supposed to be peer to peer, and, while the term peer isn't limited solely to individuals, it appears that LendingClub may allow institutions to invest in notes (Of course, why wouldn't they?). Well, upon further investigation, I found it appears that this is more likely the case and I'm curious as to what this means for your daily non-institutional investor. 
What I found was that some notes only had a sole [investor](https://i.imgur.com/80stkfS.png). Given the ability to buy/sell notes via API, I'm curious as to how many of these institutional investors exist, and what percentage of notes posted are immediately grabbed by a single investor. What type of tools and technologies are being developed by these institutions? While the API disclosure says that API users don't receive preferential treatment, given the news this morning, it sounds like someone over at Lending Club is working with these high-dollar investors in some capacity and allowing them to grab entire notes based off certain loan criteria (though they're not very good at it).

Any LC investors have thoughts on this?

Specific Questions:

* What does this mean for non-institutional investors in LC notes?
* Are these institutional investors primarily taking low-risk notes?
* If LC allows for a single investor to assume an entire note, what does that mean for the pool of notes that remain available?
* Given that LC has attracted institutional investing, is this demonstrative of positive sentiment in favor of P2P lending?",8

16-05-10,4inwlk,Why should I make any allocation into bonds? (special situations),"Before you crucify me, I understand that bonds are a useful asset class for **most** portfolios. But is it good for all? In every situation, at every stage in life? 

What if someone has a lot of capital. What if the capital base is large enough for a 2% SWR is enough to take care of all living expenses? What if in addition to that capital base, there is still income form regular work for several decades? Especially if other income is present so in bad market years those 2% can be reinvested into the market instead?

Basically - if volatility is irrelevant to the portfolio holder (because the holder isn't dependent on the portfolio at all), why would one still invest in fixed income assets? 

I'm curious to learn specifically from 'devil advocates' why fixed income would still be a superior strategy as it is wildly recommended as such. To be clear, I'm using superior == higher total return with the flexibility to 'wait out' a bad market (ie: not selling anything for 3 - 5 years if need be).

I understand that the retiree who is using his capital for living expenses can't wait out a bad market. But someone in his 30s or 20s absolutely could. Someone with a large capital base who never needs more than let's say 2% (or less) could as well, regardless of age. What am I missing and shouldn't it be advised to avoid bonds in those special situations to maximize total return? ",4

16-05-09,4ik9ra,Choosing the right degree,"I'm graduating later this month and I'm still a little bit indecisive on what my major should be. I originally was going to go into computer science and learn more about computers since I do a lot of gaming and computer stuff in general (building pcs, researching the newest tech,) but I'm pretty garbage at math, and haven't done any coding except some html, which was sort of hard for me. So I decided to maybe push that aside and put it as a minor or something. 

I recently took some business course at my school such as financial literacy, banking/finance, and entrepreneurship. I thoroughly enjoyed all three classes and I decided I want to learn more about the stock market and how corporations work in general. I don't necessarily have a entrepreneurial mindset and idk if I want to create a business, but I wouldn't mind managing the finances of it because the whole money aspect of investing got me more interested, than dealing with random numbers that meant nothing when I'm in a regular math class. 

I currently have my major set to business management (in oblivious as to what AAS, AS, BA, BS, AND BFA mean when choosing which one) I'm not entirely sure is this is the right major to choose for what I want to do, or should I change it to finance, economics, or accounting? Or does this major go over the same courses anyway? 

I would love to hear your thoughts as well. I was thinking of taking a coding class to see if I enjoy it because of how much I'm on computers, and have everything else finance related.",22

16-05-09,4ilpjr,Free Android app for a quick statistical forecast and the day trading strategy that inspired it,"I’ve uploaded my first Android app to the Play Store: [QuiKast](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.ktek.quikast)

The goal of this app is to provide people with no knowledge of statistics whatsoever the ability to make a statistical forecast quickly and easily.  It takes any series of numbers, then provides you with its prediction of the next number along with its confidence in that prediction.

I used to use Excel for the same thing but that still required a lot of manual steps that I wanted to automate, so thanks to a lot of reading and time over at /r/dailyprogrammer I learned to code and this is the result.

My strategy was basically to forecast a corporation’s quarterly EPS ahead of their announcements.  If my forecast was higher than the mean of the analyst estimates with a high enough confidence, I would buy the stock at close the day before the announcement.  I would then sell the stock by the end of the next trading day.  I had a long run of success doing this before a painful string losses had me take a step back from it. I’ve become more conservative with my investments since so I’m putting this tool/strategy out there in hopes that some of you might get some use out of it.

This is a step-by-step walkthrough of what I did:

1.	Identify companies with upcoming earnings announcements either after market hours the same day or before the market opens the next morning (I used eTrade’s market calendar)
2.	Enter the company’s past quarterly EPS in the app (I would aim for the past 16 quarters)
3.	Compare the app’s forecast to the mean analyst consensus
4.	If the forecast is significantly above the mean analyst consensus and has a high confidence, place an order to buy it on close
5.	After open the next day, enter a trailing stop order (I usually used 0.5%)

This is what I created the app for but there’s nothing stopping you from using it for whatever other ideas you might have.  

As I mentioned above, this is my first app so I’m sure there’s plenty of ways to improve on it.  Please let me know if you have any ideas on changes to make.",3

The stock is sitting around 3% under the buyout price. Since I bought around IPO it's been over a year == long term capital gains.

**Is there any reason I'm missing for why I shouldn't sell right now?**

The only upside of waiting seems to be that we'd eventually get 3% more return by waiting till the deal goes through ($57 vs the ~$55 it is currently).

There's some risk associated with the deal falling through etc., and a long wait when similar gains can be found in more diversified funds, which suggests I should sell.

Am I missing anything? It seems like after the deal goes through it liquidates automatically to cash so I wouldn't be gaining anything beyond that 3%. Is the 3% such a sure thing it's a better deal than say the same amount in an S&amp;P500 type fund?

16-05-10,4ip69n,Associated Capital: Buying $1 of assets for $0.75,"[In November 2015, GAMCO—an investment management and advisory company owned and managed by famed value investor Mario Gabelli—moved a substantial portion of its cash, investments, and 4.4m of their own shares into a newly created company named Associated Capital. As of this writing, Associated Capital currently has a market value of $770m, which seemingly indicates that the company’s stash of cash and investments is being fairly valued by Wall Street.](http://www.slowappreciation.com/blog/2016/4/28/associated-capital-ac)

&amp;nbsp;

 |Value|Per Share
:-|:-:|:-: 
Cash &amp; Equivalents|$205,750|$8.12    
Investments|$413,882|$16.33
4.4m shares of GBL|$166.541|$6.55  
**VALUE**|**$786,173**|**$30.99**  
**MARKET VALUE**|**$770,870**|**$30.12**

&amp;nbsp;

Yet in addition to the spin off of cash and investments, GAMCO also created a five year $250m promissory note (i.e., loan), payable to Associated Capital at 4% interest.

Despite the note representing a very real economic benefit to Associated Capital, it’s true worth is obfuscated by the GAAP accounting because it’s a “related party loan”—i.e., a loan between two companies controlled by the same person—thus excluding it from the asset side of the balance sheet. But as the note matures, Associated Capital will receive payment from GAMCO, thereby increasing the company’s cash balance by an additional $9.83 on a per share basis.

&amp;nbsp;

 |Value|Per Share
:-|:-:|:-: 
GAMCO $250m Note|$250,000|$9.83    

&amp;nbsp;

Additionally, Associated Capital’s downside risk is relatively low because its other assets are highly liquid and thus easy to value: cash can be taken at face value, and many of AC’s investments have market quoted prices. And Mario Gabelli—who owns 75% of both companies—has a proven track record of creating long-term value. Recognizing that Associated Capital is trading at a discount, the Board of Directors has authorized a buyback of 500k shares, which will help to close the gap between value and price. 

With 25% of its value not yet realized by the market, a value-centric owner in Mario Gabelli, and a highly liquid asset base, Associated Capital makes for an attractive opportunity with very limited downside. An investment in the company would be like buying a house worth $500k for $500k, and then a month later discovering that there’s shoebox buried in the yard stuffed with $125k. The GAMCO note—much like the shoebox—represents hidden value not yet appreciated by Wall Street.

It’s very likely this accounting quirk has created an opportunity for prudent investors to almost literally buy $1 of assets for $.75, which, according to both common sense and Warren Buffett [""is a very good thing to do""](http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2013/03/04/aapl-when-the-stock-is-down-ignore-critics-create-value-says-buffett/).",9

16-05-10,4ip6ef,Dividend stocks and total return,"Dividend stocks and total return

Hello!

I can´t wrap my head around total return, dividends and earnings per share growth rate or dividend growth rate.

I´ve read on several sites that the total return for a year is the dividend yield and the earnings per share growth rate or the dividend growth rate. Total return = Dividend yield + Earnings per share growth rate

The Street exemplifies with Microsoft: the dividend yield is 2.6% and the earnings per share growth rate is 8.8% which together makes the total return 11.4% (2.6% + 8.8%).
http://www.thestreet.com/story/13022398/2/how-to-calculate-total-return-for-dividend-stocks-with-3-examples.html

Does this model expect the stock to move its share price 8.8%, the earnings per share growth rate, to get the expected total return of 11.4%? If the dividend growth rate also were 8.8% and the share price stood still, the total return would be nowhere near 11.4%. 

Example:
Year 1:
Stock price: $100
Dividend Yield: 2.6 %
Previous dividend: $2.6
Dividend Growth: 8.8%
Year 1 dividend: $2.6 * (1 + 8.8%) = $2.83

Total return, the way I see it, is what I had when the year began, and what I have at year´s end. In this case:

Start of Year 1: $100
End of Year 1: $100 + $2.83 = $102.83 = $102.83 / $100 -1 = 2.83% Total return.

Where do I get it wrong?

The last two years I've been very fortunate to see my income increase significantly, and I'm at the point where I have more cash sitting in my low interest accounts than I'm comfortable with. I've been hesitant to keep dumping 100% of the cash into stocks/ETFs, and the advice around here to other people in my situation seems to be to look at REITs and maybe Fixed Income investments. I don't know much about either, and am looking for feedback on what REITs (or something else?) I should consider based on my goals and current portfolio.

Background:

* I'm 31, single, making just over $200K per year today (in sales though, so could easily change tomorrow)
* This will be 80% retirement funds, 20% money for nearer term goals

**Debt**

* Mortgage - $2,300/mo with taxes, HOA etc. ($388K left)
* $3-$5K/mo credit card debt (pay off each month in full)

**Assets** 

* Fidelity Roth IRA: $80K - Mutual funds and ETFs (85% US/12% Intl/3% bonds) Biggest holdings today are FCNTX, FBGRX, FSCRX, FBALX
* Fidelity Non-Retirement account: $60K - Mostly tech stocks, and ETFs (FB, GOOG, AAPL, BRK.B, BA, V, several others + ETFs - IBB, XLV, XLY)
* $70K cash: $20K checking/$50K emergency fund
* $4,000 in I-bonds (I auto-invest $200 per month)
* ~$200K in home equity
* $1,350/mo in rental income
* Car

Really appreciate any feedback and advice on where to go from here w/r/t REITs. Thanks!",4

How would one make that call?  My thesis for getting involved in low-vol was to try to capture it as an outperforming factor, but it's so expensive now, it would appear that even a small factor boost from low-vol wouldn't make up for 13% different for like 20 years, suggesting selling?

The authors take a bunch of valuations produced by sell-side analysts and analyze the mistakes that they make. I suspect home gamers are making far more errors then these analysts.

**Errors and questionable judgments in analysts’ DCF models**

Jeremiah Green, John R. M. Hand , X. Frank Zhang

Abstract

We investigate the number of and reasons for errors and questionable judgments that sell-side equity analysts make in constructing and executing discounted cash flow (DCF) equity valuation models. For a sample of 120 DCF models detailed in reports issued by U.S. brokers in 2012 and 2013, we estimate that analysts make a median of three theory-related and/or execution errors and four questionable economic judgments per DCF. Recalculating analysts’ DCFs after correcting for major errors changes analysts’ mean valuations and target prices by between −2 and 14 % per error. Based on face-to-face interviews with analysts and those who oversee them, we conclude that analysts’ DCF modeling behavior is semi-sophisticated in the sense that analysts genuinely make mistakes regarding certain aspects of correctly valuing equity but also respond rationally to the incentives they face, particularly the reality that they are not directly compensated for being textbook DCF correct.

&gt;Carlos Kirjner of Sanford Bernstein Co. sees few obstacles in the company's way, although there might be an unusual one: having too much money. ""We think Amazon's businesses are now so large, fast-growing, and profitable that it is harder  for the company to find new areas of investment to keep up with the growth in gross profits,"" he wrote. ""[T]ime is on the side of margin expansion.""

First off what is RSV?
Respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, is a respiratory virus that infects the lungs and breathing passages. Healthy people usually experience mild, cold-like symptoms and recover in a week or two. But RSV can be serious, especially for infants and older adults. RSV is essentially the flu’s lesser known brother and most people will have it at one time in their life (likely mistaking it for the flu). RSV is the most common cause of childhood respiratory infection with a global disease burden of 64 million annual cases and 160k annual deaths. An RSV vaccine would be unimaginably profitable; since it infects mainly the young it is logical to assume that parents would pay any cost to combat and prevent one of the leading causes of childhood hospitalization.

Pipe line:
RSV Vaccine (Older Adults): Phase 3 (Data expected sometime Q3)
RSV Vaccine (Infants: Maternal Immunization): Phase 3 (Data Expected sometime Q3)
Influenza Quadrivalent Seasonal: Negligible compared to RSV
Influenza Pandemic: Negligible compared to RSV
Ebola Vaccine: Negligible in profit but proof of concept in expeditious Vaccine Creation

Novavax is a very unique clinical stage biopharma company for a few reasons. They have an 89 million dollar grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, and a 179 million dollar contract from the US Govt. to use their unique technology to develop vaccines. Unlike most clinical startups who partner with a distributer prior to trials Novavax has built up their own infrastructure. In fact, Novavax is still not officially partnered. In their most recent earnings call they heavily hinted that they had been approached by more than one entity and were pleased with how those talks have been progressing. Despite the fact that they refuse to comment on their ongoing PH3 trials there has been some interesting activity. It is reasonable to assume that those at Novavax have some preliminary information regarding their PH3 trials that they are not sharing. 
On May 3, 2016, the Company entered into a new lease with IP9 1201 Clopper Road, LLC (“Landlord”) for approximately 150,000 square feet of facility space located at 1201 Clopper Road, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20878 (the “Lease Agreement”). Under the Lease Agreement, following the rent abatement period discussed below, the annual rent for the premises will be approximately $3.3 million with annual increases of 2.5%. Pursuant to the terms of the Lease Agreement, the Company will receive rental abatement for the premises through November 30, 2017. The Lease Agreement also obligates the Company to pay building operating costs and requires that the Landlord provide the Company with a tenant improvement allowance of $9.6 million. The lease term extends to 2030, unless earlier terminated by the Company in 2026. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by the text of the Lease Agreement, which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.4.
I don’t know about you all but if I was a company in PH3 I would not be leasing a 150,000 sq foot facility if I believed there was any real chance that the drug I was testing would be rejected. The leadership, especially CEO Stanley Erck, all have extensive histories in publically traded companies in the biopharma industry. Chief Medical Officer Louis Fries has a 22 year history of clinical vaccine testing with a focus on the very relevant influenza. President of R&amp;D Dr. Gregory Glenn was medically trained by the army in the Madigan Medical center, specializing in the very relevant field of Pediatrics. Dr Glenn has innumerable scholarly articles and holds multiple patents in the field of vaccine discovery and delivery. Through past positions the management team has connections to Baxter (BAX), and Sanofi (SNY), giving further reason to be confident in their ability to find a suitable distribution partner.

The last thing I want to talk about is the stock's price. Last August the stock was at 15$, last month the stock was at 5.60, today the stock is at 4.63. The stock was overhyped. You can look back at old articles and see the insane amount of content written on a security whose main possible source of revenue was still in PH2 clinical trials. Jim Cramer even had a segment on it. They had a 4bn market cap and yet were losing 30 million a quarter. With the most recent earnings report released it was revealed they they had upped their losses to 70 million last quarter, sending the price to what it is now. I expect Novavax to spend more, in fact, I expect them to keep spending more the closer they get to beginning production. The price they are at now is about the price they were at before being thrust into the eyes of the media, which in my opinion is a steal, especially considering between then and now they have been awarded a grant by the BMGF and have progressed into PH3 with very positive PH2 results. 

Oh yea also you will all be happy to hear that Martin Shkreli said they had interesting RSV data (just check his public investing google drive folder)",12

Here's the ***[output file](https://github.com/kurvee/bitcoin_taxes/blob/master/output.txt)*** for my own taxes.

I'm somewhat confused about wash sales. The final output is the same regardless of whether I run the code with the --nowash argument. My question is:  **why is total calculated gain the same regardless of whether wash sales are incorporated into the calculation?** As you can see from the output, there are a number of wash sales flagged.

Slightly complicating the matter, I did not file taxes in 2014 and am therefore including my initial Bitcoin purchases from the end of 2014 in my 2015 taxes, lest I'm forced to report a $0 cost basis.

If you're inclined to download the code and run it, the command to run ""python bitcoin_gains.py --end_date 2015-12-31 --non_interactive --assume_purchase_if_less_than 3.0 csv/Bitstamp/Transactions.csv csv/Bitfinex""

Any assistance would be much appreciated. I could probably figure this out by myself by simplifying some test input, but as the IRS is involved, I'd prefer to have someone else at least look at it. Thanks!

16-05-11,4iu7w4,How can I achieve mass public votes in #voom competition? Any support much appreciated!,"Hi people! I'm looking for any advice you can give on enticing a large volume of people to vote for my business and donate to my crowdfunding campaign.

I'm currently competing in a business competition where I need votes from the public in order to be in with a chance of winning. The competition is called #voom, and the top prize is the opportunity to pitch to Sir Richard Branson... I need that opportunity! The top 80 businesses get to go through to the next round off the back of the public vote - I'm currently at 105th, and I need about 200 more votes to get into the safe zone. 

My business in a nutshell is an online marketplace for antique/reclaimed/industrial/vintage homewares and character pieces. The aim is to provide sellers with a profitable and usable online platform by which they can capitalise upon the booming popularity of reclaimed interior design, and also to enable buyers to reduce their environmental impact through the purchase of salvaged items rather than environmentally damaging mass produced ones. 

I have a couple of things lined up within the next 2 weeks before the competition closes including canvassing days and radio appearances.... but I really want to turn up the heat and look for ways to charge up the pack! Any insights and advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks for your time, and here is a link to my pitch for anyone who is interested:

16-05-10,4iq4he,"I'm wasting money with my investment advisor and need a way out. Please advise.","So...August 2014 timeframe I decided to finally invest my money instead of having it gain a puny amount of interest in the bank.  My stepdad was going to invest with a fellow VFW member, and I decided to go along with it.  He wasn't able to switch his funds over for some reason, but now I have about 65000 invested and 62000 value right now.  Obviously, I know the market took a shit and shouldn't expect gains so quickly.  But here's my dilemma:

This guy isn't providing any real value to advising.  The last visit with him, I found out he is pushing an entirely new fund.  That fund seems to be doing better than my current one, but I already feel invested in this current fund.  This might be a firm-specific question, but do I need to be paying this advisor?  Should I stick around in this fund or cut my losses and try somewhere else?  My main concern is the 3000 hit that I'm taking if I switch over and have to pay loading fees or anything like that.  Thanks in advance for the advice.

TLDR:  Got into a pretty shitty fund with a pretty shitty advisor.  Don't feel the advisor should be paid with my money so I want to switch or just get him off if possible.  Need advice going forward on what to do.",9

16-05-10,4iqaob,What to do with $$$ from the sale of a house?,"So my wife and I bought a condo unit three years ago for $287k in a gentrifying neighborhood in Chicago. Fast forward three years, and I receive a job offer in Denver. We want to sell our house (instead of renting it out) in Chicago, and then rent for 1-2 years in Denver until we get our bearings and decide where we want to buy.

As I mentioned, we bought for $287k (current UPB is $272k), and are going under contract today for a sale price of $380k. That's $108k profit. $19k will be going towards agents fees, leaving us with a net profit of $89k. 

**My question is, ""What do I do with that money?""**

A few points:

* We're hoping for a better return than a CD would offer.

* We would like to invest that money, but still have it somewhat liquid. The investment would likely be approx. 1.5-2 years, as we would need that money as a down-payment on the purchase of our next home.

* We have about $10k of credit card debt, averaging an interest rate of around 22% APR. We are planning on paying off all credit card (unless someone finds a compelling reason why we shouldn't).
Also worth noting: We have student loan debt of approx. $40k. We are not planning on using any of the proceeds to pay down the student loan debt.

* This leaves us with about $52k. Where is the best place to put this money to maximize an investment in 1-2 years?

Our cost of living will be as follows (in the event it matters at all):

* Income: His salary of $100k/year, plus a 25%-50% annual bonus to be awarded in February.
   Her income is $43k/year

* We have a one year old son, whose daycare costs approx. $1,450/month.

* Our rent is $2,200/month

* Car lease of approx. $300/month

* Student loan payment of approx. $350/month.

* Rest of expenses are normal expenses for a family of 3 incl. groceries, cable, cell phones, etc.

* dec 2013- dec 2014: 43.24%
* dec 2014- dec 2015: 7.36%



q1: are the 'Absolute Returns' the % of the principal investment an investor would have gained in, say, 2014-15? ie $10000 becomes 10736 at 7.36% AR?

q2: by the 'risk' of mutual funds, do they mean a hypothetical negative AR in 2014-15 (ie -7.36%) would be deducted from the principal investment ($10000) and become $9264?

16-05-10,4is7br,Publix Stock,"Hey guys,
I was looking for some insight and opinions on the value of Publix stock.

For those unfamiliar with the company, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publix.  You can read more about the stock info here: http://www.publixstockholder.com/servlet/ProxyServlet?path=/stockholder/Home.do

This was the First Quarter 2016 press release:
Publix’s sales for the first quarter of 2016 were $8.7 billion, a 4.5 percent increase from last year’s $8.3 billion. Comparable-store sales for the first quarter of 2016 increased 3.3 percent. The company estimates sales increased 1.2 percent due to the effect of the Easter holiday being in the first quarter of 2016. In 2015, the effect of the Easter holiday was in the second quarter.
Net earnings for the first quarter of 2016 were $581.9 million, compared to $548.9 million in 2015, an increase of 6 percent. Earnings per share for the first quarter increased to $0.75 for 2016, up from $0.71 per share in 2015.
These amounts are based on unaudited reports that will be filed today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and made available on the company’s website at www.publix.com/stock.
Effective May 1, 2016, Publix’s stock price decreased from $45.20 per share to $43.95 per share. Publix stock is not publicly traded and is made available for sale only to current Publix associates and members of its board of directors.
“I’m pleased that our Publix associates delivered strong results,” said Publix CEO &amp; President Todd Jones. “Unfortunately, these results were not enough to offset the challenges in the stock market.”

Here’s a graph of the stock’s price history since 2011: http://www.publixstockholder.com/managed_images/2016/sif3185539217672210258.png

When I first received dividends in the summer of 2015, the dividend rate was .39 semi-annually. In the fall, they went to quarterly dividends at .20 and this spring increased them to .2225.
 
I’ve been with the company for 3.5 years. As a vested employee, I received stock equal to about 8.5% of my take home pay every year (as of last year for me). Between the company’s contributions to my PROFIT Plan and those I’ve purchased, I hold 180 shares. 

While the company culture is very “all-in” on the stock and plenty of real examples of average employees turned millionaires after long careers with the company, I’m aware of the risk of having too much tied to your own job. 

I have a 401k and Roth IRA in index funds, but was considering other investments options and wanted to weigh them against my investments in Publix. 

Just looking for opinions and insight as I’m still learning a lot about stocks and investments. Look forward to any responses, thanks!

Some of the articles on it think its a good idea, while other laugh at it. Some of the companies sector etf's have done well, while others have flopped (farming, waste management, fishing).

16-05-11,4ivjmo,When to exercise employee stock options,"My mom works for JNJ and part of her compensation is stock options. She has 5908 option contracts for JNJ with a strike price of 72.54. With a current price of around 114.50, the current value of these options is about 250k. They are fully vested and she could exercise today if she wants.

She is 55 and plans on working a few more years and has other streams of income (pensions, real estate investments) in addition to her salary. 

She said she doesn't think she'll need the money until 2020. Her plan was to wait until 2020 to exercise because JNJ could be at 200 by then. Well she's not wrong, I was thinking that kind of puts her eggs all in one basket and she would be better off exercising in the near future and investing the proceeds in to a well diversified portfolio that she doesn't touch till 2020.

Thoughts?

EDIT: I should clarify. She is not relying on this money for retirement. Its just gravy really. Her retirement plan is a mixture of her 401k, military pension, work pension and social security. 

EDIT 2: Thank you for all of your replies! I sent the link to my mom and she read all the responses and was very impressed by all of the helpful advice that was provided.

As some have speculated, the options are non-qualified so she would pay her income tax bracket on them. They have an expiration of January 2023. 

She told me she is going to take some time to decide how she will proceed from here, obviously considering risk and tax liability. ",11

16-05-11,4ist27,Finance job interview question,"For all you wannabe traders out there, here is a sample question to ponder.

**Question:**
You have two stocks ABC and XYZ that are perfectly negatively correlated. ABC can either double (+100%) or halve (-50%) in price each period with equal (50%) probability. Similarly for XYZ.

(a) What is the mean arithmetic return for ABC and XYZ?

(b) What is the mean logarithmic return for ABC and XYZ? What is the economic interpretation for the mean log return? What is the variance of log returns?

(c) Can you make money from trading these stocks? If so describe your trading strategy and the expected returns for the strategy over time.

[Do people think this question is too easy or about right for undergrads? I'll post my answer mañana.]

**Edit:**

These are my answers (and feel free to shoot me if I'm wrong).

(a) Arithmetic mean = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (-0.5) = 25% for both stocks

(b) Mean log return = 0.5 * log(2) + 0.5 * log(1/2) = 0 for both stocks

There seems to be some confusion about log returns. An easy way to keep these straight is that they are just the logarithm of gross returns. So if your stock return is 5% (net return), then the gross return is 105% (1+net return) and the log return is log(1.05) = 4.879%. You can also see from this why this is the continuously compounded return as exp(log(1.05)) = 5%.

The economic interpretation of the log return is that it is the growth rate of your investment. In this case, you would not expect any long-term growth from holding either ABC or XYZ.

Variance of log-returns = 0.5 * (log(2))^2 + 0.5 * (log(1/2))^2 = 0.48

This comes straight from the definition of variance Var(X) = E[(X-E(X))^2 ].

(c) Since the two stocks are perfectly negatively correlated, if we hold both stocks in equal amounts, then we can get a certain net gain of 25% in each period. Then you should rebalance your positions so that you are again holding the stocks with equal weights.

**Edit 2:**

To be very clear I'm asking for the return for stock ABC and the return for stock XYZ. Also by arithmetic mean, I'm asking for the expected one-period return.",24

16-05-11,4isudk,Amazon,"I have been studying tech companies for a while now. This past year, when there was blood in the streets in China and stocks where down, I was close to pulling the trigger. I knew it was the time to buy, and AMZN is at an all time high. I keep beating myself up over not hitting it then. I still want some skin in the stock but $700/share is rich. However, I believe it will be the first stock to eventually hit $1,000 then split at some point. 

I am new to investing in the stock market. I have $10,000.00 that I want to invest. This is set aside to start in trading. I know the idea is to spread out my money, but I can diversify later. My thinking is to invest at least $8,000.00 I would make a nice return on my money within the year. I believe in this company and believe they are just warming up. My question is, if I only have $8,000.00 to invest, is this a smart move? I know it's not much but my return will surpass any interest a bank will return. I have additional money in the bank and it's not working for me. I want to start putting my money to work. I would like to break into day trading at some point. Is Interactive Brokers ideal for this? 

If I play it right, it's going to hit a high at the end of the year, then split. At that point, I can diversify my portfolio. I want to invest in something I know and believe in. I will also be making money from Amazon from other services they offer so I will also be reinvesting some of my earnings over time, or using that money for other stocks.

The other stock that is a buy right now is Apple, but I think Amazon is still a far better buy. 

Please give me any insight as I am new to the game. Is Amazon a buy and please consider my place. Thanks.  

Summary: New to investing, I want to invest $10,000.00, do I buy in Amazon, wait for it to hit even higher, then split? OR wait for it to drop in price, then buy? Problem is, I don't think it will for some time.",0

Do you think the state will approve Northern Dynasty Mineral's Pebble mining project?","For the last several years, the state of Alaska has sourced much of its revenues from the oil industry.  [However, with the recent downturn in oil, Alaska is scrambling to find new sources of tax revenue.](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-06/the-party-s-over-in-alaska)

Northern Dynasty Minerals ([NYSEMKT:NAK](http://www.google.com/finance?q=nak)) owns and wants to develop the [Pebble project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Mine), which is one of the world's largest copper\gold mineral deposits.  Efforts have been undertaken over several years to get this project ready for construction and development (originally drilled in the early 90s).  However, the project has been stalled by the EPA due to strong opposition from local environmental groups (happened back like 3 years ago).  Leading companies have exited the partnership set up to develop this mine as a result.

However, do you think that, due to the downturn in oil and gas, and the consequent funding issues experienced by the state government, that the environmental permits to develop this mine will be issued?",3

[This article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/douggollan/2016/04/13/the-superyacht-industry-is-poised-for-growth/#1fb24699786a) from Forbes talks about the yacht industry is set to grow this year.  Article goes on about super high earners, and their penchant for floating castles.  Article talks about the yacht industry growing, or more accurately the private boat sector.  I guess you guys want some analysis; well I don't got anything really extensive.  But the article got me thinking so I looked up publicly traded boating companies and Brunswick popped up, they also make yachts like [this one](http://www.charterworld.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/New-Hatteras-100-RPH-Yacht.jpg).  

I popped over to SEC.gov and got to reading their 8-K report for the first quarter and it's up; revenue growth is up 9% vs 1Q 2015, 10% increase on constant currency basis, 20% growth in diluted EPS.  That's all *completely* Latin to me.  Unless World War III breaks out it sounds like a long play on the company, though that's not taking into account that I haven't looked into their closest competitors in the boating industry but at this point looks like it'll be night and day as their closest competitor are small-cap stocks, vs BC being the only mid-cap that does what it's doing.

Well that's all I got, I'll get back to lurking.

16-05-11,4itac6,[TA Hypothesis] Oil and the EIA Report,"The EIA report is coming out at 10:30am tomorrow and I figured I'd walk you fucks through what I think about /CL this evening.

[Look at this chart.](http://imgur.com/VTDLMBU)

There's only three things for certain before news. Things will move up, down, or sideways. I've drawn here a guide for five options, because magnitude matters here people.

* 1.) EIA report is garbage. /CL goes down, crashes through the downward trend line support and gets on a trajectory for $41.5

* 2.) EIA report is moderate garbage. /CL goes down and follows the falling wedge until next week's news.

* 3.) EIA report is perfectly in line with expectations. /CL squeezes its way into that short, perfectly sideways wedge.

* 4.) EIA report looks pretty good. /CL follows the upward trend line support and quickly goes to $45.7.

* 5.) EIA report says there's no oil left in the world and the Saudi's are selling their oil fields to the good old US of A. /CL explodes past $45.7 and takes a moon-shot towards those higher trend line resistances.

Obviously some of these things are more likely than others. It should also be noted that current technicals, in a newsless void, imply that we're moving sideways-to-down for the next few days.

Doesn't this mean that the BoJ is propping up the Nikkei in a pretty strong way? If the Nikkei drops, the BoJ will be there to float it up, to some extent, is that correct to assume? 

In my view, this means that the Japanese market is having trouble finding actual investing to move the Nikkei, and is therefore leaning on the government to pick up the slack. Which, to be fair, is what they've been trying to do for a while but still. Is this the right way to look at this?",20

Finally free with all obligations so gonna try to do these as much as possible. there's some interesting stuff happening right now with futures. (comment if there are any mistakes, I copy my template from past times so I may have fucked up an image)

Here is a 5 min chart of SPX futures since yesterday's close (4PM):

http://imgur.com/hNFhLk7

We close at the purple line (~2079), so futures are down quite a bit compared to how green we were yesterday. I'm liking this parabola, giving me a chub into today's trading day. We have broken the key level of 2076 and attempting to break 2071.25 support (stuck there for now). Next support is at 2062. The 1 hour on futures is now bearish, which is a good sign. Also, there is a death cross on the 5 min (60 sma, 200 sma) - if you're into this type of superstitious shit. Another death cross on the 5 min between 100sma and 200sma is looming.

My guess is that futures are red because of oil and expectations of a bad oil report tomorrow. Shorts will rejoice if the report is hella bearish. I've got to hope these futures keep their red, and become even more red (note: im bearish on spx). 

___________________________________________________
Here is the 5 min chart of CL futures since yesterday's market close (4PM):

http://imgur.com/0KaRKow

The purple line (~44.7) signifies that price of /CL at market close (4PM). Overall crude has been declining over the night as people are taking profits/getting out before oil report/entering short positions for oil report. Facing resistance at the 44.1 support level which it is trying to break right now. /CL is entering a bearish phase on the 1 hour, which is good. 
___________________________________________________

Here is the 5 min chart of GC futures since yesterday's market close (4PM):

http://imgur.com/RaqFVAE

The purple line (~1267.7) signifies that price of /GC at market close (4PM). Gold is trying its best to rally once again; attempting to break the 1272 resistance level. Ever since the bounce off 1259.5 on the 10th, gold has been doing very well. I predict a possible re-test of 1300 this week. Gold is also looking great on the 1hour chart.

My plays for today and my current positions:

1) I'm currently in put spreads for this week, 2 weeks out, and 4 weeks out (bought all when spy was around 208.2). Also holding ICs expiring this week with upper breakeven of 208.5ish. Bought very wide ICs for June as an experimental position, breakeven of 202ish and 209ish.

2) I don't have a major short oil position besides a tiny small position in USO put spreads. Looking to pony up and buy DWTI tomorrow, no matter what the CB.

3) Judging by the action for the next 6-8 hrs, I will see whether to close my spreads. I am worried of a possibly bullish oil report today, and I would not be able to close out all my bearish positions fast enough (specifically my spreads with smaller DTE). I will figure something out there... or just hold through it.

4) Looking to open a call position on GDX for a day trade today. If we somehow manage to hit 1300 today, I will open a short position in gold via put spreads on GDX and hold. ",51

16-05-11,4iu18i,Sunworks (SUNW) is expected to report earnings later this morning. Thoughts and expectations?,"Sunworks (formerly SLTD), after successfully transitioning to the NASDAQ, has raised their year over year revenue from roughly $20M in 2014, $53M in 2015, and are expected to make $100M in 2016. They have almost no debt, after paying it off in late 2014, and are one of few solar companies that is securely profitable. They have been profitable since Q3 of 2015. 

I don't think they attract larger investors just yet, because even at $100M for 2016, they are still ""smaller,"" but this stock could be very promising down the line. I'm a long who has cautiously added since 2012, but am finding that I feel safer as time passes investing in this company. 

They have a history of acquisitions, and are expected to make 2-3 more in the future. They are primarily in California, which has a booming solar market, but are also in Nevada. 

Given how badly the solar sector has been getting killed since May of 2015, these guys are still impressing me. Their backlog is over $50M, and they have stressed that $100M guidance for 2016 is conservative. My estimation is that they will really pay off in 2018-2019, once their revenues attract significantly larger investors, but as someone who has been in the stock since 2012, they have been one of the best stocks I have purchased. Certainly the best long stock (best short holds would definitely be the pot boom of early 2014, which was absurd by all accounts). Cowen's price target (while I know it doesn't mean much) is $5+ or so.

This bond, which is sold at auction by the U.S. government, also tends to signal investor confidence. When confidence is high, the ten-year treasury bond's price drops and yields go higher because investors feel they can find higher returning investments and they do not feel they need to play it safe, but when confidence is low, the price goes up as there is more demand for this safe investment, and yields fall.

NZD/JPY ^(Note Bottom Support Level 72.88) --- NZD (the 'base currency') is quoted in terms of JPY (the 'counter currency'). The Yen is a historically low-yielding currency, making an attractive vehicle to fund carry trades (where traders borrow cheaply in JPY to buy higher-yielding currencies, including NZD). Investors tend to favor carry trades at times of optimism about global economic performance and stability; they shun them at times of market stress. This makes NZD/JPY sensitive to swings in broad-based market sentiment trends.

16-05-12,4iyw4t,Best ways to invest in agricultural commodities for the short and long term?,"I've been in oil the last 6 months, but have also been keeping an eye on the agricultural side of things. Corn, soy, and wheat, all of which are at lows have seemed to have stabilized in value, with some starting to creep up in the last few months. 

What ETFs do people recommend for directly investing in these, or should I target farm companies themselves? For short-term investment I've though about trading DAG, while for longer term I've though about SOYB, JJG, and UAG. 

I don't have a lot of experience in this area, but understand that farmers will shift out of certain crops when prices are low. Wheat has already seen a decline in winter plantings and I'm wondering if we'll see the effect of that carry out slowly over the rest of the year. In addition, the excess of corn has led to farmers buying it up for cattle feed, which may be one reason for a recent rise in price. ",5

They've received $6.1 million in grants and collaborations for its vaccines. They have no currently approved vaccines, but are receiving milestone payments from its partners.

I'm considering ways to calculate how much money could be made off of these vaccines. WHO, the Red Cross, Bill Gates foundation, etc., are potential whole sale buyers for their zika and ebola vaccines. These are just examples, I'm not saying they will.

There is still major risk involved. Even though the vaccines are promising, there is an almost insurmountable amount of competition. JnJ is developing an ebola vaccine it plans to pair with other routine shots. Merck and glaxosmithklein are other competitors for ebola. I haven't looked into competition for their other drugs yet.",4

Preface- I know we all love Biotech and Pharma companies, ALL HAIL THE GREAT SHKRELI, so it was a bit intriguing when I stumbled upon an upcoming IPO that seems to have some really good potential to make a splash in pockets of investors and the market.

Discretion: Under any circumstance please do not blame me/target me/call me out if this ship sinks and likewise if this stock decides to go bananas when it opens up. This is only to help in your researching making decision and to guide you as a footprint in this investment.

Body- Here we are! So we all know cancer is a very growing epidemic in the US and even the world. Millions of people die from cancer a year and I'm sure that someone very close to us has been lost to cancer at some point in life. Although many pharma companies are trying to treat cancer once its discovered, what if one biotech company could help prevent it from ever becoming a problem? Per it's website, their vision is pretty clear, to put an end to cancer by treating it in its very early stages when it is most vulnerable. The platform states: ""CPP’s mission is to prevent cancer or the reoccurrence of cancer by identifying and treating the cancer risk factors early. The CPP Wellness platform is a patient-centric, prevention-focused model driven by rigorous science, supported by proactive patient outreach and comprehensive physician communication. Application of this 3-pronged patient-focused treatment model will allow us to get to the patient before the cancer does."" Currently their main focus is colon cancer, gastric cancer, and a rare neuroblastoma cancer which starts in an embryo or fetus.

Pipeline- Almost everything they are working on is in Phase II or Phase III and so far showing promising results. They have received numerous grants from the government to help their R &amp; D.

Board and CEO- Their CEO is Jeffrey Jacob who is highly respected in the biz and has been around 2004 with another company relating to cancer. Another specific person on the board is Jon Saxe who is also part of at least 3 other companies including the BOD in Durect (DRRX) which is developing the highly anticipated Remoxy (oxycotin killer) and has a few other promising meds in the pipeline.

Here's the numbers:

Share Price- $12-14 Shares offered- $1.9mill Offer amount- $30mil Total Expenses- $900k Shares over allotted- 288,462 Shares Outstanding- 7,429,911

Revenue- 3.7mil Net Income- (-5.6mil) Total Assets- $1.8mil Total Liabilities- 12.4mil Stockholders Eq.- (-21mill)

Final Thought- Thanks for getting through to all of this. I honestly think this is a small cap stock that will only go up from its suggested IPO price. Discovering and preventing cancer is a huge game changer and I am going to buy shares as soon as I can on Friday, May 13, when it is expected to go public. I own shares in a few other pharma companies such as VRX, INO, DRRX, SGYP and also FIT, MTCH, NRF, and LPL.

""You down with CPP? So are we!"" Please comment on what you think about CPP.

16-05-12,4izukb,Overnight Futures Development (05/12/2016),"Hey guys, here's the outlook on today after some interesting action yesterday.
___________________________________________________

Economic calendar for today:

http://imgur.com/c1Joz0U

All eyes on the jobless claims. Tomorrow will be HUGE with producer price index and retail sales (expected to be garbage).

Here is a 5 min chart of SPX futures since yesterday's close (4PM) and a 30 min chart to show the past few days:

http://imgur.com/0UcXKs6


http://imgur.com/OGBA9Jd

We close at the purple line (~2060), so currently we are up a bit. I'm unsure of why futures are green, despite Europe being red and Asia being marginally green. Busted right through all three SMAs on the 5 minute and looking to break 2070 as of 5:57 AM. The jobless claims later today will clear up the direction of the spx futures.

___________________________________________________
Here is the 5 min chart of CL futures since yesterday's market close (4PM):

http://imgur.com/Vxcgeun

30 min chart over a couple days:

http://imgur.com/NQj2kXl

The purple line (~46.1) signifies that price of /CL at market close (4PM). Crude traded pretty flat all night and recently has begun its rally upward. The dashed black line represents the high we got a few days ago. Seems to be a kind of mental resistance here. Oil looking to break 47; already has formed 6 month highs as of 7:42 AM
 
___________________________________________________

Here is the 5 min chart of GC futures since yesterday's market close (4PM):

http://imgur.com/2lgc24h

The purple line signifies the price of /GC at market close (4pm). The futures are down about 9 dollars and looking to break key resistance at 1272. Jobless claims report will be indicative of today's GDX action.

__________________________________________

My plays for today and my current positions:

1) I'm currently in put spreads for this week, 2 weeks out, and 4 weeks out (bought all when spy was around 208.2 2 days ago). Also holding ICs expiring this week with upper breakeven of 208.5ish. Bought very wide ICs for June as an experimental position, breakeven of 202ish and 209ish. I am still in all these positions except for closed my spreads out for this week. Plan to hold these spreads until we see 205s.

2) I bought DWTI with a CB of 86. I'll be down a bit but not enough to worry about. I may average down one I get to do PM trading in 2 hrs.

3) Gold play is dependent on jobs report.",21

16-05-12,4j0c4f,Investing in Foreign Indeces as a Hedge,"Hey guys, I am a young buck, just getting out of school, and starting to put together an investment plan. I am sticking to stocks, as my horizon is very long. 

What I am thinking is 50% S&amp;P 500 (which has enough internal diversification (should reduce firm specific risk to negligible levels) not to mention good returns, around a 10% historical average, with acceptable variance

20% high risk premium tech stocks of my choosing

The last 30% I am interested in putting in a foreign Index that hopefully has factors uncorrelated with the S&amp;P 500 and will be able to lower my total level of systemic risk. It seems like Europe and the US are very interconnected in terms of systemic risk, but what about asia? Also do their happen do be any asian indeces with a higher sharpe ratio than we could find from any domestic markets? 

Please tell me what you think about this idea. 

PS- My % allocation to each asset class is extremely rough at this point and I will do a bunch of analysis before I start investing, but its probably around where I will be investing. 

PS- If any one had any websites which displayed the various historical sharpe ratio's, returns, variance, of foreign indeces I would love ya",4

Also, it is unknown if a positive result is predictive of a subsequent fetal abnormality, and if so, what proportion of infants born after infection will have abnormalities. 

So there are 2 plays I see here look for companies that make this kit (http://www.mybiosource.com/prods/PCR-Kit/Zika/datasheet.php?products_id=598109#QLDESC)

And Or look to companies figuring out how to test the placenta etc. to detect fetal infection. Because mom infected doesn't always mean baby is.

16-05-12,4j0rhg,What is on your shopping list and why?,"Trying to get some detailed discussions going. Would like to hear some ideas from people, but better yet, why: I love to read people's reasoning/thesis behind choices on investments.

No particular order and may not buy, but five on my list:

1. Equity Lifestyle (ELS). Well-run REIT with a great deal of waterfront/near water property (The REIT has 80 properties with lake, river or ocean frontage and more than 100 properties within 10 miles of the coastal United States.)  In a way, it is also a play on the retired population: ""This is a huge opportunity and fits right into Equity Lifestyle's sweet spot. That's because its RV resorts have an average resident age of 55 and its manufactured home communities' average resident age is 62. With about 180 RV resorts and 200 manufactured home communities, Equity Lifestyle should be an early beneficiary as the baby boomers crest into retirement."" (http://seekingalpha.com/article/2777665-equity-lifestyle-properties-inc-a-giant-mobile-home-reit-for-the-growing-age-wave) However, would rather see it in the upper $50's/lower $60's.

2. Prologis (PLD) Large, global industrial REIT, seeing tremendous benefit from online sales. While Prologis has a very diversified set of customers, Amazon is at the top of the list. Their exposure to e-commerce continues to grow.

 3. Stag Industrial (STAG) is another industrial REIT possibility.

4. CF Industries (CF). While not as diversified as Agrium (AGU), CF has been the strongest fertilizer player over the long-haul. With the rumor of Bayer or BASF buying Monsanto this morning, there is the feeling that we are at least somewhat near a bottom in agriculture.  Nice dividend. 

5. Roper Technologies (ROP). Exceptionally run platform company and, like Danaher (DHR) gets little attention while continually providing terrific returns over the years. May eventually spin off or sell its legacy industrial businesses and while that in and of itself is not a reason to own it, it is a potential plus. Danaher is splitting into two companies in July (record date of June 15th, I believe; 1 shares of newco Fortive for each 2 owned of DHR).

Edited to add: the move in Gilead (GILD) is getting ridiculous. If it gets into the upper $70's, it will get too appealing to ignore.

16-05-12,4j2m9j,The S.E.C is Useless to Stop Stock Fraud,"It is well known that most investor complaints by individuals to the SEC are ignored.  If you call them they will make you feel like you are bothering them and that you are crazy.  They will request that you do their entire investigation for them essentially.  

For instance,  I've called them a number of times about naked short selling that is known to be happening in shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  They even have a pdf on their website about naked short selling in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and how it was used to bring down the value of the GSEs to almost zero.  http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf

Naked short selling is happening in hundreds of companies and the SEC has awareness of it and has done nothing about it.  To stop it would be as easy as locating all the shares of stock that exist in a company and determining if that amount greatly exceeds the amount of shares that should be in circulation. (it does).  

Counterfeit shares in the market should be the number 1 priority of all financial regulators.  They represent the most significant danger to the financial system that exists.  Everyday that risk increases as more and more shares are created and are moved through the system.  It could make the 2008 financial crisis pale in comparison to the losses that taxpayers might be forced to recover.  No one can know the exact number, but is likely to be in the many billions of dollars already.  Will market makers have the capital to cover their short positions if forced to do so?  I am betting that they will simply file for bankruptcy if discovered.  

A website from the founder of overstock.com below details how his company was almost bankrupted by naked short sellers, and about how the stock in 1000's of companies has been targeted by stock counterfeiters.  https://www.deepcapture.com/",60

16-05-13,4j5nnw,New to investing. Self-employed expat. SEP/Roth/Solo 401k or 100% taxable Vanguard?,"Hi all,

I've been reading as much as humanly possible over the last four weeks to educate myself on investment/retirement strategies. I'm finally ready to push the go button but need some final tips. Here's a quick fact sheet that makes my situation unique.

* 33 years old. US citizen. Married to foreign spouse (non-resident alien to the US)
* Expat in Germany
* Self employed
* Subject to German public pension which means no SE tax to the US
* Nearly all money comes for US clients to US bank account
* Germany gets full tax rights to all worldwide income
* No prior knowledge of investing/retirement (never too late to start)

Here are things I **think** I know so far in my search:

* I absolutely can not invest in index funds here in EU because the IRS will classify these as a PFIC. This, unfortunately, includes private pension plans. Moreover, German institutes won't even bother with me due to FATCA
* I keep a US address, US bank account and US VPN
* I opened a taxable personal Vanguard account online
* Traditional IRAs may be useless to me since I do not get the pre-tax money benefit of them.
* I can create ""earned income"" in the US to contribute to a Roth by using Foreign Tax Credits vs the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion

So, there it is. I have 6 months of living in an emergency fund (USD), ~38.000€ in a local checking account, and as of now I'd like to get started with 100.000 USD. Due to being an expat, a lot of the tax advantaged accounts don't help me. Also, I don't have employer matching. I'm looking for **three** primary suggestions.

1. What's the best strategy for opening and maxing out traditional retirement funds (keeping in mind my spouse is a non-resident alien with no ties to the US)? I've read into SEP, Roth, solo 401k, etc however because I don't have to pay SE tax to the US, I'm not sure how/if that affects the solo accounts.
2. Alternatively, with my age/situation, does it even make sense to use traditional retirement accounts or should I go 100% taxable?
3. Lastly, should I go all-in or do something like 40.000USD up front with 10.000/month for the next 6 months? (note* I also intent on doing monthly, automatic deposits in my Vanguard account in addition to the above number) 

I'm mainly looking to do a 85/15 funds/bonds split. Mostly using VTSAX to get started.

Looking forward to your tips!",2

16-05-13,4j5ubg,Entering the financial world from a STEM field,"Hopefully this isn't breaking any sub rules. I checked the FAQ and it should be fine, but it's a different flavor than most of the other posts here.

September I'll be entering my second year as a physics major at a large public university. It's not an ivy,  but it has a good reputation in the field (top 50 physics). Seeing the struggles of someone trying to make it in the academic world has had me questing how far I want to pursue this as a career path. It's not that I don't really like what I study, I actually really enjoy it, it's just that the jobs market in academia isn't so attractive right now. 

I've done a lot of reading that people with STEM backgrounds sometimes move into the financial world when they decide academia isn't for them, the thing is I've never seen *how* they make the transfer. It looks like landing these jobs (usually as a quant at an investment bank/hedge fund) is all about networking at an ivy league school. That's an obvious problem for some that *doesn't* go to an ivy. My university doesn't have any obvious ties to major finance institutions.

I'm not looking to change my major, just trying to keep all my doors open, and the quantitative world of finance has always been something I've been drawn to. I figure I should definitely start thinking about the future now while I have another three years to make connections. 

It's worth mentioning that while I've got some background knowledge on the technical side of things, I'm still very much in the dark about how things actually are. I mean, maybe STEM people in finance is actually somewhat rare? Maybe they only hire PhDs? Maybe it's a volatile field just like academia? I really don't know the reality of things. This seems like a good place to ask.",9

http://forexwinners.ru/forex/category/tools/full-courses/ mostly forex stuff but you can find a lot of tim sykes dvds here. just download from the links provided. 

finviz.com for scans if i didnt mention that.

dojispace.com i got a quick education on dojis from that place.

learn about bollinger bands they are helpful for intraday trading. 

tradesystempro.com - tons of books. learn about doji's bollinger bands. 

http://torrentz.eu/search?q=fous cameron fous very educational. not my style but i believe there is always something to learn from someone. 

my style is more breakouts and then watch them thru the day (if my job wasnt 5 days a week i would) and then trade intraday for more profits like warrior trading. i would love to pay for his dvd package but youtube will have to do.

http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school this place is loads of info. it's like a college class online. everything you need is here or at least all the basics and you can later dive into things you want to know for your style. 

one thing i learned from tim sykes and time grattani and nate machaud, is who cares what the company does. trade the ticker not the company. this holds 100% true if you are to be a day trader. you are chasing profits and not investing millions to make more millions long term. thats my opinion anyway.

zacks.com if you want to trade based on earnings but that doesn't always mean a good report will lead to an uptick in the chart.

this also has tims dvd's http://www.bengforum.com/Thread-GET-Timothy-Sykes-Trading-Strategy-Full-Course-8-DVDs havent tried to download from it so i don't know if it will get you all of them or how long it would take.

the thing about nates dvd is he has a lot of good info but some of it is silence and watching his trade from some day at 10x the speed. http://torrentz.eu/4f71b50dc827111e7d6338901279d1df9ce20670 this is the second dvd in nates series

interactivebrokers.com is 99 cents a trade.

http://www.elitetrader.com/et/index.php?threads/trading-tickers-dvd-by-tim-grittani-99-huge-discount.296300/ this is tim grittani's dvd someone is selling on profit.ly it is for the streaming version. if you get it let me know, i might want to get it too if it is worth it.

just stumbled on this. it may be helpful and money saving. http://www.tradingdvdshop.com/

i found a similar place that was selling dvd's cheap but it must be on the history on my desktop. if i get a chance i can get that to you. probably thursday or friday night. but this should be plenty. don't get overwhelmed. it should be like going to school. watch a dvd or so for an hour. take a break. take notes.and finish one before you start the next. i would suggest also learn more about each tool the dvd's tell you about like bollinger bands after you finish the dvd or what ever interests you.

i personally use bollinger bands. exponential moving average (ema) for 13 day period like cameron fous. and then i stumbled on a volume weighted MACD. anything helps but too much clutters your screen.

when you learn more then move to learning how to create custom scans to meet criteria you like. that stockcharts chart school is a lot of reading but it is organized.

those are basically the resources ive used so far. like i said im new too. but im determined to make this part of my income. especially living in cali and i can be up and trade before work when stocks move the most. it's a no brainer. if i wake up that is. that's been a struggle someday. keep in touch tell me how things are going. maybe you could teach me somethings too. post your daily watchlist in the pennystocks forum and learn from everyone else too. it's a good forum so far.

I also have a book from warrior trading as a pdf. I can email that to you if you like

I'm 28 and my investments have a five to ten year horizon. I am pretty much happy with historical returns but it seems that this is not a good time to be entering into broad stroke buy-and-hold strategies. I'm value oriented, my first books were the intelligent investor and securities analysis, the big reset and the new case for gold so you can see where I'm coming from. I'm investing from China so I lose quite a percentage to trade any US\EU based stocks but I do consider them constantly. Trading in China gives a lot of opportunity because there is nowhere near as much professionalism driving prices here and so bargains can be easier to come by, the caveat is that I'm more or less on my own when it comes to advice so I need a firm foundation on which to base my own independent decisions. My first round of investment in stocks has been in mining, copper/gold/silver and I'm looking to diversify out of it. I'm just writing to ask if anyone can recommend any books that can generate a good understanding of how different sectors interact with each other through various market cycles.

My current asset portfolio is 30% stocks (100% in Jiangxi copper company which actually generates 25% of its profits from gold and silver and is currently trading at less than its book value and is responsibly financed). I'm saving really a lot of money so I don't have to move money around, I'm just trying to figure out the grand scheme of things so I can diversify my stock holdings with my new savings. I'd really appreciate any book recommendations that could expand my awareness and perception of the macro forces and how they interrelate. ",2

16-05-13,4j5z79,Daily UGAZ/DGAZ thread - 5/13/2016,"Suuuuuper interesting that natural gas dropped even more overnight, but it does currently fall on a trending support line stretching from mid-April. I would have *guessed* that ~$2.15 was the new support line given gas' reluctance to really drop for a few days. Could have made more from this week's $DGAZ positions by holding until now, but the recent high was a longer swing upwards than it's had for quite some time. All in all though, natural gas is still in it's channel upwards starting back in early March. 

I think $UGAZ might be a good play today. You may need (want?) to hold it overnight. I said it a few days ago, but I really don't see natural gas dropping below ~$2.05-$2.07ish. Hourly stochastic indicators are showing the overnight drop to be slowing down already.

16-05-13,4j674r,Friday Pre-market FYI,"Good morning and happy fucking Friday to all of you faggots.

I felt like being a little proactive in addressing what will surely turn out to be a lot of crybabies asking why their $NUGT is getting buttfucked or why their $SPY faggot's delight puts are going to be worth next to nothing at open.

Before you ask stupid questions first fucking google it.  If you find something ACTUALLY interesting, go ahead and share it.  Don't just make a post where the title is your question with nothing else in it.  Next up [take a look here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwin9fDkhNfMAhUEdD4KHQPgDZIQFggdMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fmarkets%2Feconomic-calendar&amp;usg=AFQjCNFjy4P4PTDrZYWH8VCdQx0G9QQGsw&amp;sig2=ijyU0769alPa-6Z4gEgdzQ).

Kind of funny how we watched retailers get fucking destroyed all this week with shitty earnings numbers, but some how we're supposed to believe [April retail sales](http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/economic-calendar) figures are fucking fantastic.

The only other report that has a market impact today is [producer price index](http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/economic-calendar).  This, to my understanding, is a measure of inflation.

So what does all this mean and why is my perma bear mentality draining my account?  First off, obviously above estimated retail sales numbers means the masses are out spending their hard earned cash on stupid shit.  YAY CONSUMPTION BASED ECONOMY!  After that, what has the fed been talking about since 2013?  Raising rates.  Next decision is coming up on June 13th.  With producer prices coming in at the very bottom of estimates that is an indication the fed will again NOT raise rates in June because inflation, according to this report, is lower than expected.  No real indication of economic strength there.  If you want a return on your money it needs to be put in the market and not an interest bearing vehicle.

Just remember I'm a stranger on the internet and nothing of what I just said should be converted into actionable trading advice.  Hell maybe I'm even misinterpreting it?  However, if you find yourself wondering why futures are doing what they're doing here is my explanation on it.  Maybe those gains reverse by end of day and the apocalypse is announced over the weekend, converting all of those faggot's delights #SPY puts into a fleet of yachts?

Hope you learned a thing or two.  Go fuck yourselves and have a lovely weekend.",14

16-05-13,4j43js,[X-post] Interesting comment for those interested in tobacco\vaping,"[Look, I know Reddit loves to make vaping the butt if its jokes, but I'd like to be serious here for a minute.
The FDA just passed regulations that will essentially ban 99% of vapor products in the very near future. Any vapor product released after February 2007 will be banned, which is essentially all of them, save for the most rudimentary devices that are crap. Ecig technology has advanced tremendously in 9 years. I stopped smoking a few years ago thanks to vapor. Many millions of others have also stopped smoking by using ecigs.
The must infuriating thing about it, is in order to introduce a new vapor product, the manufacturer must submit it for review to the FDA, a process which could take a year or more and cost several hundred thousand to millions of dollars, and approval is not guaranteed. The problem with that, is the vapor industry is dominated by small and medium sized businesses, which do not have the kind of resources to comply with this approval process. And even if a couple do have the resources, the FDA can just say lol no after they've invested the time and money.
You know who does have the time and money to comply? Big tobacco companies. The vapor products you see in gas stations- Vuse, MarkTen, and Blu are all substandard products distributed by tobacco companies. You bet your ass they won't get pulled from shelves while all of the small vapor companies shut their doors. This regulation will destroy thousands of small businesses and jobs. A billion dollar industry dedicated to getting people to stop smoking has been snuffed out like a cigarette.
It is very plain to see that tobacco companies have bought and paid for the FDA. Why? By eliminating disruptive competition, they can keep people hooked on their smelly cancer sticks and keep the profits rolling in. The interests of big tobacco and the interests of public health are mutually exclusive.
If you smoke, know someone who smokes, or know someone who has been killed or maimed by tobacco, it's imperative that you write your members of Congress in support of HR2058, which will give vapor companies the breathing room they need to fight this overreaching abuse of power by the FDA and tobacco companies. You can also help by donating to vaping advocacy groups like CASAA or SFATA.
tl;dr- The FDA, seduced by big tobacco's money and lobbying clout, has essentially banned vaporizers; a move which could literally kill thousands and thousands more people by keeping them hooked on cigarettes. The FDA must be stopped. - OP u/jmanpc](https://np.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/4ixsad/we_get_it_you_vape/d32aywr)

16-05-13,4j77h2,WFCF - Where Food Comes From,"First time posting to WSB. Not sure if anyone else follows this company, but WFCF provides ""food source verification"" auditing. They verify all the ""non-GMO"", ""free range"", and ""cage free"" claims you see on food. I have owned since it dropped down to $1.90, looks to be starting to pick-up pretty quickly over the last few days.

""Source verification"" has become pretty big with consumers recently. WFCF benefits from having a large offering of verification services, so basically you can get multiple things verified *(age of products, non-GMO, source, etc.)* all from one auditor versus having to have numerous auditors to verify all these different claims. In the last few weeks they have signed on to get their first label into Whole Foods *(it will be on a private label Whole Foods product, meaning there is potentially more business with Whole Foods to come)*, and recently announced that Dannon (yogurt) will be exclusively using milk sourced verified by WFCF.

[Here is a pretty good article](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3589356-food-comes-venture-capitalists-dream) (Seeking Alpha, take it for what it's worth) that I think does a pretty good job summing up the overall long-term opportunities in the market.

EDIT: Also just realized that on Yahoo Finance the price chart does not go back very far... this company has been around since the early 90's, doing exactly what it is doing now. Stock was at some points down as low as $0.10-0.20 back many years ago. Was up to about $3.50ish last summer when the entire small cap space got hit hard. This is a solid, legitimate company, so I believe it will outperform as small caps come back into favor. Don't really have the time to comb through statements to pull financials, but [here](http://wherefoodcomesfrom.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WFCF-5May16.pdf) is a presentation from the company that shows some numbers from over the past decade.",14

16-05-13,4j7fvb,"The manipulation of our markets, the uselessness of the SEC, and why you can’t win.","I’d like to have a discussion around just how manipulated our markets are, and why I highly advise all of you to avoid trading in individual securities. Sorry if it’s long but please read.
 
There are a plethora of stocks I could have used, but I want to illustrate my points using two securities, XON and BOFI. The former is a biotech company, the latter a small cap branchless bank.
 
Now, whether these are good investments to make I can’t tell you. What I can tell you is that they are likely being manipulated by hedge funds that are purposely driving the price down through the use of illegal, but hard to prove, tactics. Many of the sites that you may use, such as Seeking Alpha, appear to be complicit in this (more on this later). Everyone involved is profiting, at your expense. 

You are probably familiar with ‘pump and dump’ schemes. This is a form of fraud where a stock price is artificially inflated for personal gain by distributing positive information that is either false or misleading. Once the stock runs up, they sell in mass, the stock tanks, and average investors lose their money. This is highly illegal.
 
What I’ve seen more often recently is a different kind of fraud. It’s called ‘Short and distort’. This is where someone shorts a company, then releases an ‘analysis’ (I use that word lightly) that is filled with scare tactics and misleading information meant to scare investors into selling. Once the stock tanks, they cover their shorts, take their money, and disappear. This is also illegal, but happens all the time. 

The short of it is this. A hedge fund allegedly pays an unknown third party to possibly pay a website like Seeking Alpha to push their agenda. (I use these qualifiers like they do to protect myself, because that’s all that’s needed apparently). 

Now let me make a point here. There is nothing wrong with writing a negative article on a stock. And there is nothing wrong about shorting a stock either. What is wrong, unethical, and illegal, is purposely manipulating the markets through the use of “hit pieces”.  These articles lack any substance and are filled with speculation, innuendo, unsubstantiated allegations, and are carefully written to avoid legal ramifications.  They have lurid graphics and scary predictions (bankruptcy is likely imminent!).  
They are careful about the diction they use, using words that sound nefarious like “dealings”. To avoid legal trouble, they make sure to qualify their ridiculous accusations by preceding them with statements like “likely appears” or “allegedly”. 

The titles of these articles are meant to scare you. Here are a few examples using the articles Seeking Alpha has written on BOFI:

OnDeck's Implosion May Soon Engulf BofI: (Article given PRO status for some reason)
[LINK](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3973481-ondecks-implosion-may-soon-engulf-bofi)

The Walls Are Closing In On The Branchless Bank:
[LINK](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3965195-walls-closing-branchless-bank)
In this article they mention the ‘Panama Papers’ as a way to spook investors. 


Why BOFI Created A Phantom 'Full Service Branch' In The Nevada Desert:
[LINK](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3859626-bofi-created-phantom-full-service-branch-nevada-desert)


They want you to think the companies going bankrupt so you get scared and sell. And it works, look at what happened after that first article was published. Stock goes down ~10% premarket, people are manipulated to sell once the market opens, the shorts cover, and in this case the stock recovers completely by the end of the day. But the shorts still made their money. They tend to publish the article a very short time before the markets open. 
A recent article on XON, that was frankly comical, had the title: 

Intrexon: Zika Virus Hype Is Nonsensical. Is this the next Theranos? [LINK](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3968205-intrexon-parts-2minus-8)



Now a few things you should know.

1.	Theranos was another biotech company that was basically fraudulent. Comparing them to XON is essentially saying “Is XON the next Enron??” It’s a scare tactic, and an unfair baseless accusation.  

2.	I can’t say for sure that was the title of the article. They edited out the Theranos reference a few days after it was published and the stock tanked. Seeking Alpha would not give a valid reason for why this very controversial part of the article was removed. If it was not factual, it should have never been published in the first place. 

3.	This was meant to be an 8 part series, published over 8 days to help the shorts. A little excessive don’t you think? Well I think SA was afraid of being investigated so instead of allowing the 8 part series like the originally were going to publish, they made parts 2-8 all be published at once. 

4.	Once parts 2-8 were published, they then had to edit the articles again to remove language that might get them in legal trouble. They had a few paragraphs on a man named Thomas Reed (name of the founder of XON), that made some serious allegations. I forget what was written because they removed it. Turns out they had the wrong Thomas Reed, so they just removed that part of the article and left the rest published.

5.	In order to edit an article after publication, Seeking Alpha has to agree to the changes. These edits were all approved to be removed by Seeking Alpha, not the author himself. Seeking Alpha is seemingly not doing any due diligence before allowing this stuff to be published, and just removes the parts that are proved to not be factual days after the publication. 

6.	The Editor of all these articles, Douglas House is his name I believe, appears to have a conflict of interest based off the comments he’s made. 

Now here’s what really bothers me. It’s my opinion that Seeking Alpha and it’s editors are likely complicit in this illegal behavior and are going out of their way to push these articles. It’s also my opinion that they are doing it not to generate more clicks, and thus more revenue, but because something even more nefarious might be going on. 
Seeking Alpha claims they want to ensure they are “the go-to destination for serious investment discussion”
If that’s the case why is the following true?

1.	All these hit pieces are written anonymously. Yes, every single one of them is written with an alias, and the authors name is never revealed. Why would they allow such ridiculous articles to be published without requiring the author to reveal themselves? At the very least, they should require the authors name. 

2.	Why are they promoting these articles? Not only are they publishing them, they are pushing these articles on the front page of their site. They are giving them ‘Pro’ status, a qualifier that’s supposed to be given to only to ‘must read’ well written articles,  in order to give them even more attention so that more people see it and are thus manipulated.  

3.	They are constantly deleting comments that call out the article or disagree with assertions made in it. Many of my comments have been deleted; ones that I’m sure did not break any rules and were highly up voted before being deleted. They seem so quick to publish these hit pieces (it’s my opinion they don’t actually review them, just based on the timing of the publications and how they constantly have to remove factually incorrect information) but they screen all the comments like a hawk. 

4.	The editor who’s pushing these articles on XON seems to have some conflict of interest on this stock. I went to look at some of his old comments because they were quite alarming, but couldn’t find them. I assume they were deleted as well. 

5.	Seeking Alpha is pushing third party articles, written by Adam Feuerstein (who the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) has requested the SEC investigate him for stock manipulation) because they appear to push the agenda that Seeking Alpha is seemingly going for. Positive news seems to be ignored, while negative news seems to be pushed on the users of Seeking Alpha, even if it’s just by some blogger.

6.	The timing of when these articles are published is suspect at best. Options expiration's tomorrow or in a few days? You can expect a hit piece to be published. It’s almost to the point where I can look at a stock’s price at open and know whether or not a hit piece was written on that day. 

I encourage all of you to look into this yourself, read these articles, read the comments, and become familiar with what is going on. Don’t take my word for it. 

I also encourage you to contact the SEC to report any manipulation that you believe to be happening. I have to warn you, I tried to do this myself, but this government institution meant to rid fraud and protect people like you and me, can’t even set their website up so people can submit complaints. I tried repeatedly, but kept running into technical issues. 
[LINK](https://denebleo.sec.gov/TCRExternal/disclaimer.xhtml)

It’s my opinion that they are as ineffective as any other government organization and simply cannot be relied upon to protect us. 

My advice to you, recognize these attacks when you see them. Remain vigilant, don’t be fooled, Don’t let scare tactics convince you to sell solid companies for a loss. Emotion can be dangerous when it comes to investing. 

At the same time, know that serious accusations can be legitimate. You have to learn to tell the difference unfortunately. The securities I mentioned were just two of many that are being manipulated on a regular basis. 

Do not use the websites like Seeking Alpha that lack all journalistic integrity and appear to have ulterior motives. Know that people are being paid every day to write articles and comments on articles that push a certain agenda. 

I won’t even get into high frequency trading today. Or how congress isn’t subject to the rules of insider trading and make excessive returns (Paul Ryan that asshole selling before the stock market crash because he knew what was going to happen). Or the other ways are market is being manipulated at the expense of your average investor. 

I’m absolutely convinced the markets are rigged. If you disagree with my assertions, please tell me why, im an open minded person. Thanks for reading.

READ: http://seekingalpha.com/article/3975952-since-filing-quarterly-report-1-week-ago-sunworks-diluted-another-million-shares

^Disclaimer: ^This ^is ^my ^first ^DoubleDicking, ^so ^be ^gentle.

**SUNW: The fuck's this shit?**

SUNW (formerly known as Solar3D) sells a bunch of sweet-ass metal stuff that converts sun magic into electricity that can be used for a variety of stuff, like powering electronic vibrating dildos with which you can double-fuck yourself after buying faggot's delight AAPL calls. In the past they were shoving a lot of money into developing some ""solar 3d"" technology, which would turn flat grids into like a 3-D ice cream cone or some shit, but without the chocolate chips and cookie dough. Yeah, it's as stupid as it sounds, so they decided ""SCRAP DIS SHIT"" and have since stopped funding what equated to a technological search party for a magic wizard.

**This sounds really dumb. Have you forgotten a similarly named company for which WSB had a massive hard-on, and which recently went bankrupt? Is this shit going to happen again?**

Your *face* sounds really dumb.

SUNE went bankrupt because they kept borrowing money. It's like they spent a shitton of money buying Beanie Babies, without realize that not many people give a DICK about Beanie Babies. They couldn't afford to pay back their loans, so they went bankrupt. Also I'm pretty sure their CEO was a fratbro. I mean, their CEO's name was Chatila. *Chat*ila. *Chad*. Need I say more?

SUNW is the opposite of SUNE (cardinal directions, fellow navigators). SUNW has a Scrooge McButtload of cash on reserve. They have more liquid cash than they have debt, and they don't intend to amount any debt in order to fund fruitless takeovers.

**Is solar even profitable?**

SUNW was cash-flow positive for Q3/15, Q4/15, and for 2015 as a whole. Their net income was about -25mil in 2014, and was +1mil in 2015. Their balance sheet looks *tits*. Their sales have gone up like the goddamned [Up-Goer V](https://xkcd.com/1133/).

**Their earnings report was two days ago and their stock has fallen faster than boner detective's credibility. Why should I put my tip into this stock?**

Earnings *were* negative, yes: there was a net loss of 378k (0.02 per share). The reason the stock fell after earnings is that people are RIGHT fuckin' dumb -- they were expecting the sun to shine in the middle of the night. Consider this: who the butts buys solar equipment in the fucking WINTER time? Goddamned no one, that's who. SUNW's Q1 sales are historically its worst of the year, *by far*. The reality is, SUNW's sales for Q1/16 were just under FOUR TIMES its sales for Q1/15. And its Q1/16 losses were almost 1/4 of its Q1/15 losses. Also, bear in mind that its sales for Q1/16 were ALMOST as high as its highest month of sales EVER (Q3/15). That's right, its historically worst month almost topped its best month ever. Next earnings, the true potential of this stock will be revealed, but Q3 is the big one. Be aware that the stock might not move much after positive earnings, but I really believe this stock will eventually balloon, and I'm in a few hundred shares right now.

**Okay, so what are the drawbacks?**

Aside from my foreskin when I jerk to this stock, here's a couple of other drawbacks I've seen:

* People claim that the CEO has a history of diluting stocks of companies he's run. Can't find much info about this.

* Low trading volume

**Welp, that settles it! You've convinced me!**

Good. Now lick my chode.

So that's it. That's my DD. Now slap my face and call me a stupid whore slut, because I like it that way.

Or just give me some constructive ""go fuck yourself"", because I'm still learning this shit.",22

16-05-13,4j7tt3,I close my SPY puts. Gold still looks shiny,"We tagged the 365 SMA ($204.38) and bounced off it. That along with the $204-$205 level is strong enough support that even though the market is weak we should go up a little from here. I could be wrong but I think $204.38 is the bottom for the day and Monday get a small bounce before going back down on tuesday or wednesday. Weekly momentum has shifted to bearish so I will definitely be buying puts on any bounce we get next week.

-

I'm holding no positions over the weekend but gold in my opinion looks like its about to break out. I will probably miss that move but I don't want any surprises over the weekend to screw my gains for the week. It has strong support at the 20 SMA after a week or so of consolidation and completing what looks like a bull flag now sitting above its 7 SMA. Also the dollar hit resistance at its 50 SMA and should come down a little from there adding to support the rise in gold short term.

Example of how strong 2015 is shaping out to be, James Suckling has 16 wines that are potential 100s. 

Downsides are Bordeaux vintages take 10-15 years to mature and really pay off as an investment. You can get burned if it turns out the barrel tasting was overhyped like in 2010 Bordeaux futures. Upsides even if the investment fails, at least you can drink yourself to death with your money.

16-05-14,4jaef5,Why over diversify?,"I understand the point of basic diversification is to hedge losses when something goes freaky with one sector. But why over diversify? Why make sure you have a little bit in every single sector there is, including international stocks and U.S. stocks.

To me that seems like it could bring in the same amount of problems as if you under diversified. Problems don't always hit all sectors, but much of the time there are different problems happening at the same time. For instance the european financial problems and the oil and energy problems that has been happening for while, also the current retail problems that has been happening. Now you have 3 sectors that are going down and people expect the rest of the sectors. To keep your ship afloat. What happens then is your stock evens out. Many of your sectors are going down, and the other sectors are propping the others back up.


Out of all my test portfolios the ones over diversified did the worst. The ones diversified to just a few different sectors did the best. These test portfolios are usually over the past 6 years.

16-05-13,4j8sm5,"Call Options on an Inverse 3x Levered ETF (S&amp;P 500)","Okay, so I'll start off by saying I know this is basically gambling. Although, here is my logic. Please help me find the flaws. (Posted on the wrong subreddit a minute ago)

Assumptions: 
1. We have had market corrections historically every 6 to 10 years. 
2. Triple Levered ETFs such as FAZ (link below) during corrections rally like crazy

(https://www.google.ca/finance?chdnp=1&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=maximized&amp;chdeh=0&amp;chfdeh=0&amp;chdet=1463177554844&amp;chddm=499307&amp;chls=IntervalBasedLine&amp;q=NYSEARCA:FAZ&amp;ntsp=1&amp;ei=RVE2V_GKDMOg2AajoY7gCw)

Would it not make sense to continually roll over options on a yearly basis in anticipation of future collapses. Let's say I bought one call option every year at a premium of $500 and we didn't have a correction for 10 years. I'd fork out $5000 (+ opportunity cost) so let's call it $15,000 for TVM and lost opportunity of more sensible investments.

If there was a correction at the end of the 10th year, the profit would be foolish. For example, FAZ rallied to $4000 through 2012 and $8000 in 2008 at its peak (it's currently at $40). To be conservative let's say during a correction it went to $500. I'd still make $40,000 (If the strike was $100), which is well above the opportunity cost of other investments.

So I'll ask the question - am I blatantly overlooking something?",3

16-05-14,4jd2d5,How NVDA Could Dominate Machine Learning,"Good article about NVDA's prospects: http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/05/13/how-nvidia-could-dominate-machine-learning.aspx?source=iedfolrf0000001

The most pertinent points of the article: 

&gt; Facebook already uses NVIDIA's Tesla M40 GPU accelerators to help power its Big Sur machine learning computers. These NVIDIA GPUs were specifically designed to train deep neural networks for enterprise data centers, and the company says they're 10 to 20 times faster than other neural network computers.

&gt; According to MarketsandMarkets, the cognitive computing market (which includes natural language learning, machine learning, and automated reasoning) is expected to be worth $12 billion by 2019. And NVIDIA's already positioned itself to benefit from the enterprise machine learning market. Back in April, the company released its new Tesla P100 GPU for corporate data centers.

&gt; I don't expect NVIDIA's revenue to spike from GPU sales for cloud-based machine learning, but rather steadily increase as the company builds out its data center segment. With the company's growing list of machine learning GPU customers, NVIDIA is poised to benefit from machine learning's growth (and its thirst for more complex data processing). But investors are going to have to wait at least a few quarters to find out how well these machine learning investments have paid off.",9
16-05-14,4jb80n,Is this how leverage works,"Suppose I hold an stock for two days. On the first day, the stock gains 3% and on the second day it loses 1%. Hence, I would calculate the ROI on this position without any leverage as

    (1 + 0.03) * (1 - 0.01) = 1.0197

So we have an accumulated ROI of almost 2%. Now, if I leverage myself 2:1 (that is, two dollars borrowed for every dollar owned), and I assume that I can borrow money at 0.01%  for two days (is this a reasonable assumption for the time period that I am borrowing for?), does the ROI become,

    (1 + ((0.03 - 0.0001)*2 + 0.03))*(1 + ((-0.01 - 0.0001)*2 - 0.01)) = 1.057,

So the ROI is 5.7% by using 2:1 leverage. I would like to know if my computation of ROI using leverage is correct.

EDIT:

Or would it be calculated in the following way,

    (0.0197 - 0.0001)*2 + 0.0197 = 0.058,

so I would instead have a 5.8% ROI.

16-05-14,4jd8p5,Are the central banks propping up oil futures and the energy sector to prevent another bubble from bursting?,"Was reading an article recently (won't post link because not sure if allowed), but basically brings up some great points. The price of oil futures rose from $26 to $40 in an oil glut purely on speculation that Doha Opec meeting would produce a freeze, but after it failed prices stayed afloat. 2 days prior, about the time the Saudi prince was stating there would be no freeze without Iran the Fed calls and emergency meeting, chairmen meet with President and VP, and other central banks chairmen fly in from all over the world. 

Since the Doha meeting any substantial news relating to oil glut is met with support and even mild rise while any shred of good news rallies beyond belief (ie a week after Doha failed a mediocre inventory draw report  for US stockpiles sends it flying $3 in one day in the global price).

Recall that during the housing bubble banks foreclosed on all the bad loans and the market tumbled. Now the problem is all these energy companies and shale companies not able to profit at these low crude prices (anything below $45) and you have another domino affect between a huge portion of the energy sector going bust, employees laid off, other sectors dependent on that sector but on a global scale.

However, bad debt is still bad debt, and an inflated bubble can only inflate so much before it burst. If the Fed is QE'ing its member banks to keep these oil companies from busting it could turn out really bad really quick. Anyone else think this is what's happening?",3

Edit: Original position was a 56.50/57 bull put spread for a net credit of .06. It was trading at 56.97 with 3 minutes into the close when I entered the position. I was trying to scalp a few dollars into the close.

As far as my blood pressure, I'm good. I anticipated a 3 cent move up in after hours to avoid assignment. However, that didn't happen. We will see what happens with the futures when they open tonight.

There is no time value for the DITM calls. Plus, because I'll have a margin call since I'm in a Regulation T violation I'll only have Monday to close the position and the broker may close it for me, at any time. The only real trade is to buy 50 ATM for about .55 a share. I'd be fully hedged to the downside and would profit on anything above and beyond 57.55.

Yesterday I opened a Roth IRA with TD Ameritrade with $200. I'm planning on investing in an S&amp;P 500 ETF to begin with (possibly SWPPX but I'm going to do more research before making a decision). Afterwards I'll save up a bit each month to put into this account and branch off into individual company stocks, bonds, etc.

Oh and I make about $670 each month after rent, and I know that's a ridiculously low income for someone trying to invest, but I don't have too many expenses other than rent and gas. I also have a reasonable amount of money in my savings account. I just figured it'd be wise to put a small amount of savings into this account each month so I can get a head start.

Is opening an IRA at this point a good idea? Should I have opened a regular brokerage account instead? Should I be investing at all?

16-05-15,4jhbrv,Random thought: buying an ownership stake in individual family homes,"Is it possible to buy ownership stakes in individual family homes? For example, instead of a family taking out a home equity loan that they have to pay back, I would just pay them cash for a ownership share in their home.

For example, a home is valued at $250,000. The family needs cash, so I pay them $50,000 for a 20% share in the home.

10 years later, they sell the home for $350,000. 20% of the sale, or $70,000 goes to me. Conversely, the risk would be if the value of the home goes down, then I might be taking a loss.

Whenever people talk about real estate investment, they typically mean that you are buying a house and then renting it out to tenants and collecting rental income. I hate that idea because of all the work involved. I'd rather invest in a homeowner, let them do all the work when it comes to maintenance and repairs, and then when they decide to sell, I get to collect.

The advantage of this kind of arrangement is I would't have to worry about being paid back, because it's not a loan that could be defaulted on. Additionally, I'm assuming that any gains would be taxed as long term capital gains, which is nice in a world of real estate income that is dominated by high taxes. How does the paperwork for something like this actually work? If they are paying a mortgage, is my ownership stake impacted at all?",4

I don't plan on doing any day trading, just investing maybe a few trades a month.  I was thinking about robin hood but sort of don't feel comfortable with putting more than a few thousand into the app, especially due to some horror stories I have heard. 

Any feedback would be nice, thanks guys!

Edit. She gets around 100 trades a month.

16-05-15,4jer8g,"Does the options ""conversion"" strategy allow for near risk-free gains? Please help me understand where I'm not thinking properly.","I was looking at the pricing for a bunch of different conversions, and it seems that for a lot of different dividend-yielding names they offer a free ~ 1-2% yield per year. I.e. the dividend payout minus the cost of putting on the conversion is still positive. 


For example, WMT Jan 2018 ATM conversion:


Cost: ~1.30 to open.

Dividends expected by Jan 2018: 3.00

Thus, you can make 1.70 per share, or about 1.6% annualized. This seems to be 100% risk-free, since you're put-protected. What am I missing? Is the only risk that the underlying would completely cut the dividend?",1

I either pick stocks from firms I am knowledgeable about (like local companies) or in the case of index funds, I use the self help tools online to choose something that sounds close to what I'm looking for, and if after doing a quick Google search it still sounds promising, I buy it. I don't really look at any ratios, nor do I pay too much attention to how an investment does compared to its benchmark. My excuse is that I'm very busy with other aspects of my life. 

Overall my portfolio diverse, and is turning a profit, and is low maintenance (passively management without much headache). However I can't help but wonder how much more money I'd make by doing more homework.  On the other hand, knowing my personality, I'm  afraid if I started to delve into the actual  numbers I would feel more doubtful of myself,  probably to the point of not investing at all. 

TL;DR- Does a simplistic intuitive investing style lead to much worse outcomes than performing a more systematic analysis?

I'm considering an investment in $SNA, Snap On, a manufacturer of high end tools and equipment. They are basically the Rolls Royce of tools. I see it as a good long term growth investment, specifically in their Repair Systems &amp; Information division due to the increasing complexity of automotive parts. However, many of their tools are so well made they will essentially outlive their owners. This creates a substantial used market for their equipment. 

Is it reasonable to see the possibility that they will not be able to sustain or grow sales as they saturate the market as a huge risk? Similar to the situation that Apple has where many people already have iPhones and are not seeing the need to upgrade as iPhones last longer.",45

16-05-15,4ji3et,My [SHITPOST] for playing AMZN over the next few weeks.,"Looking back at AMZN over the last 2 years, they seem to make a big move up to earnings and then settle down for a few months before folks care about earnings again.

The two exceptions are:

- Q4 '15 earnings when they missed the projections
- Q2 '15 earnings when they sold off Aug '15 with the rest of the market

I was thinking about how to play this and what better way than weekly options?  You can sell a credit put spread on AMZN Jun 16 700/710 Put options for ~$400 and achieve a risk/reward of 1/0.67.  Or you could sell a spread on AMZN May 16 700/710 Put options for ~$375 and achieve a risk/reward of 1/0.60.

These odds are better than blackjack!  With this weekly plan you have a 50% chance of making a 60% return this week.  I know I won't be in a yacht by the weekend, but if you can rinse and repeat as the stock settles we could all be rocking Sea-Doos by the end of the summer!",8

First time posting here but my Mom, who is retired, is starting to get worried about her FA.  She is supposed to be invested in low risk and stable positions.  Since the S&amp;P 500 had its funk over the last 6-9 months her losses have outpaced the S&amp;P by about 5%.

She has voiced her unhappiness with this and the FA has put forward these two ideas...

1. Structured note tied to the S&amp;P 500 - 7.5% income, and from the information he provided it looks like this note would not generate interest if the S&amp;P was down for the quarter (pays quarterly interest). Our FA has said that ""these trade like a bond on the secondary market"", though I'm not sure how liquid these really are.
2. Fixed annuity - 4.75% annual cap on returns with 0 downside risk annually - only make money in years where the S&amp;P is positive.

I don't really know much about either of these instruments, in terms of risk, other than I don't like annuities, especially long term.  I especially don't believe in ""0 downside risk annually"".  In my opinion I think he is trying to sell her instruments which he will probably generate a commission on.  

I think she should look into other FAs, since he already has not met her risk expectations but I was wondering if anyone can tell me more about these instruments and whether or not these truly are safe and stable investments.

16-05-16,4jiurb,What Is A Robust Trading System?,"When it comes to mechanical type trading systems an extremely important concept to understand is whether a trading system is robust. What robustness basically means is whether a system is designed to work in a number of different markets, be it stocks, bonds, forex, futures, options and whether it will generate a reasonable amount of tradeable signals. The reason this is important should be obvious but unfortunately there are many of these guru’s out there trying to push their systems which backtest well (think of forex day trading robots and binary options systems) but in the real world are either not robust or are completely curve fitted (over optimized) and do not work at all. You have to be careful and ask the proper questions or else you can end up in a lot of trouble with a system that doesn’t provide enough/any profitable opportunities. If you start trading the wrong system and hit a rough patch from the beginning, you could end up losing your entire account in one trade and this is obviously something you need to prevent at all costs.

My system works in any market and on any time frame and is therefore very robust. If you want to day trade it will produce a number of profitable signals. As the time frame you use to trade increases, so will the number of setups that will present themselves. If you decide to go out to a daily, weekly or even monthly chart for swing trading or position trading, it will work exactly the same. This means if you are like most people who currently work a 9-5 job or are a student without access to the market for 6 hours a day, you can begin to swing or position trade utilizing my system. As your account size grows and your wealth increases perhaps you will choose to make trading a full time profession and begin to day trade on a short time frame.


Tip offs to an optimized system.

1. Unrealistically good looking performance

2. Only trades one market or sector well

3. Uses different rules for each market

4. Uses different inputs for each market even if the rules are the same

5. Uses different rules or inputs for initiating buys vs. sells

6. Does not factor in realistic transaction costs like slippage &amp; commissions

7. Uses money management methods that don’t include market normalization

8. Uses static numbers for all markets like a $2000 stop or $5000 profit target (some markets could hit those in an hour and others could take weeks). This may seem to contradict #3 but it does not. Its ok if markets have different stops and targets etc. as long as they were all dynamically computed and inputs (as opposed to a static predetermined number across the board).

* Dreyfus Disciplined Stock Fund: Value as of 9/30/15 (need latest statement) - $5,126.46
* The Investment Center, Inc. Mutual Fund: Value as of 12/31/15 - $2,714.49

* Capital One Investing: Roughly 35 shares of $AAPL - $3,168.20~ - $200 in ""cash"" in the account
* A CD worth $3,900 maturing January of 2017

Other items:

* $1,400 in cash
* Used Car worth roughly $5,000

Now, I'm attending community college starting this fall. New York state has awarded me $500 for tuition assistance. I plan to use my college fund which will cover the first two years fully. After that, my grandmother said we will discuss how we are covering the next two years. She doesn't want me taking out any loans or spending all my money on college so I assume she will be helping. 

I plan to get a job in the next few weeks, and as soon as I start working I want to open a Roth IRA, in which I will attempt to make the maximum amount of contribution annually ($5,500). My grandparents may also help with this.

I'd like to move some of my money into aggressive mutual funds as I'm very young.

As you know John McAfee has been announced CEO of MGT which sparked the stock to go from $0.30 to currently $2.80. Plenty of DD in this sub. This was just a PSA.

MGT, which is run out of Harrison, New York, said it would buy the D-Vasive assets for $300,000 in cash and 23.8 million restricted shares of MGT.

MGT and its subsidiaries primarily acquire and develop intellectual property assets, including social casino and gaming platforms.

Currently trying to figure out where this is going and if there is any estimated valuation following these announcements.

Edit: $3.13 now. This might hit 100% today. But, my DD couldn't find a basis that would support the stock price. Could be a big bubble.

Edit 2: 5/17/2016 Tuesday. Hit an all time high of $5 before dropping back down. The hypetrain never stops. Realize this is already 2000% above what it was last week. You do you based on that info.",110

16-05-16,4jjtu6,Agilent Technologies Overview,"This constitutes a beginners effort to rationalize a trade...


**BASIC**  
Agilent is a company that ""provides laboratories worldwide with instruments, services, consumables, applications and expertise.""

NYSE: A    
Sector: Healthcare  
Industry: Medical Laboratories &amp; Research  
Price per share: $42.62  
Market Cap: $14.0B  
Shares Outstanding: 327.8M  
Shares Float: 326.3  
Percent held by institutions: 86.8  
Short interest as a percent of float: 1.44  


**EARNINGS**   
A's next quarterly earnings (Q2) will be reported on May 16, AMC. The estimate is 0.39, up from a year ago's 0.38. The expected earning one fiscal year from then is 0.47. Without rambling off a bunch of numbers that one can easily look up oneself, i will note that in 2014 Agilent completed a spinoff company (NYSE: KEYS), and thus the sharp drop in share price and earnings in late October/early November of 2014 (http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20141117006373/en/Agilent-Technologies-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-2014-Results). Though this makes earnings growth hard to examine holistically over the past 3 or more years, all that is significant is that earnings grew before the spinoff, after the spinoff, and are expected to grow in the future--this is not GBSN.


Of the past 13 quarterly earnings reports, 5 beat estimates, and only 1 missed. 


**TECHNICAL**  
Agilent has been in a trading range for over a year, between about 42-44 above and 34-36 below. A is currently testing those highs and is even slightly above some of the more recent ones. I don't take much 'stock' in rsi/macd/bollinger voodoo.


**COMPETITOR COMPARISON**  
(Note: i consider competitors to be those that came up on the finviz screener after limiting results to the corresponding sector, industry and country, P/E over zero, Mkt Cap over 2B)  
*Agilent's P/E: 30.92       average of others: 30.02  
*P/B: 3.46                      others: 3.51  
*P/C: 7.25                      others: 25.83  
*P/S: 3.47                      others: 1.95  
*float short: 1.44%         others: 3.94%  
*profit margin: 11.20%   others: 7.26%  
*performance 1Y: 2.48% others: 21.85%  


**WHY DO WHAT/CONCLUSION**  
Agilent is better than or equal on all valuation metrics except for P/S. Its short interest at 2.14 days to cover is the lowest of the group. Despite all this, A's stock has appreciated the least. I think a breakout is a very good possibility.  
Comparable companies (TMO,DGX,LH) have not missed recent quarterly earnings, placing in the upper areas of estimates. I think is unlikely that A misses. If it meets it will likely react the way the above did--small pullback or uptick and then growth to new recent highs. Agilent is in the special situation however, that if it meets and rises say just another 1-2 dollars or especially if it beats, there is going to be some strong upward pressure after breaking from the channel. 


Possible plays (in order of decreasing dumbness):  
*(completely stupid): buy near-term puts or calls  
*(yolo): sell any otm or atm MAY20 puts before earnings  
*(risky): put credit spread before earnings  
*(tepid): wait for Agilent to break channel, then buy stock/calls/debit call spreads OR watch Agilent only meet or miss earnings and tumble back down into its channel and short stock buy puts/etc.  
*(pussyllanimous): buy stock if outbreak occurs  


the only issue is a big one: SPY (i suspect lower lows this week...)  
please note: this comment absolves me from any misprediction  
 

criticism is appreciated, both that which does or does not transcend an intellectual level of ""gfy, your mom has stage 3 autism"" ------thx

I am looking to start investing some of my spare cash over the next year or so and am looking for an online provider that will enable me to do this.

I looked at Halifax, but they want a minimum starting deposit of £1000 and that's a little too much for me starting out. I realise I'm not going to see returns straight away and want to start small and build my stocks over time, investing monthly.

I'd prefer no quarterly fees etc and something with a fairly good interface.

Does anyone have any experience of any good providers with a low start up cost?

Yes, I'm a noob.

Good day! :)",0

16-05-17,4jpl15,Best yolo ever suggestion. Apple stock for 1 penny.,"Since I'm having problems opening an options account here is the best yolo ever. For the small price of $3334(not including commissions) to become a millionaire. Friday call on apple stock at $100 for $0.01. Course you can just spend $1 to make a couple of hundred.

Why this particular yolo? Well no one is an idiot. Everyone knows apple stock is actually worth money. All people needed was one little tiny push to get there. Warren buffet's 1 bil investment is just that push. It raised by 3% in one day now everyone is going to be thinking ""omg I got to get in before it gets too high"". So snowball effect. People aren't going to sell the stock either to make their tiny gains like they would do other stocks.

Also Warren Buffet's investment plans always takes a little while to get around to other traders, so he does have an affect on the market it's always a delayed effect though. Interesting follow.

If I could do it tonight/tomorrow I totally would.

P.S. if someone actually listens and I make someone a millionaire I'd be happy for 20% of that.

We have considerable retirement money in UK that does earn a good return and will guarantee us a six figure income  combined when we retire so my goals here are more about paying less taxes then targeting a fix retirement income.

So yeah, We plan on working for 5-6 years more and would like a conservative way to invest the 401k money.  How do i proceed? I know bonds are the way to go.  How do you guys reckon I should proceed?

Iroquois Capital Management L.L.C. just obtained a 9.4% stake of registered shares at 1.74 million shares. They seem to be a small VC firm with several investments in the 5-35m range with 9 exits according to [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/iroquois-capital).

McAfee has 23,800,000 in unregistered shares (thus he can't dump them at the moment on the market.) for the D-Vasive sale. This has already been reported in the news that he had 23.8 million but it was an open question if he could turn around and sell them right away. Since they are unregistered they need to be registered first which will take some time. The shareholders still need to vote him in as CEO. Also, McAfee is subject to a [12 month lockout period](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001601/000149315216009538/ex10-1.htm) so he won't be dumping the shares anytime soon:

Today I sold my stake in MGT at $2.88, after getting in last week at $1.69. At tomorrow's market open I'll see about getting a new entry point. I feel a lot more relieved that this is starting to look more legitimate.

There is still a TON of risks with such an early startup - they will most likely dilute shareholders so employees would have stock options or RSUs. They also will need to most likely raise more capital from the public markets - thus more possible dilution. Right now with trading volume being 2-3x the number of tradeable outstanding shares it means this company can be pretty hyped up just like IPOs. With IPOs there can be a huge spike up then falling down once the hype is gone and people start wanting real results. Right now with the 23.8m shares under McAfee and the 18m registered shares as of closing price at $2.98/share the market cap is $125M. 

The business model right now is still a complete unknown. Is McAfee going to continue with his app? Is this going to turn into a Cybersecurity investment firm and make a ton of plays? 

Anyways this will be exciting to see.

16-05-17,4jptm4,Capital gain taxes and investing. How to minimize them?,"I was going to wait till this problem actually matters to me.. But I am curious if anyone has any thoughts on how to avoid taxes with capital gains. I have a few thoughts on it I would need to talk to a financial advisor about first. But I thought I'd hear opinions from the smartest and the wisest first. You guys.

First my situation. Not employed, no income. Being supported by my mom's social security. I would like to use any capital gains as my regular income. But capital gains seem to be taxed at 35% no matter the original income of the person.

 * Funding an IRA. Starting out small and trying to grow it inside the IRA. This only delays the tax. But it does seem to lower it.

 * Open a corporation and invest in the name of it. Using the capital gains as business income and pay yourself a salary. Use business deductions, and perhaps expand your business using other types of investments. (not sure how this would work exactly)

 *  First time home buyer credit. Use the capital gains to fund a first time home buyer and then rent out the property. This only works the first year though, and if there was actually enough capital gain made.

That is all I can think of. I'm not sure how they would work exactly. I would like to hear further ideas. Or perhaps some advise on these ideas.",0

It's currently at $49 per share and if shorts start to cover around the low 40s or somewhere in the 30's, is it possible that the buying activity by so many shorts will create a squeeze or raise the price back to a certain point?

Also, is there any way to calculate how significant a short squeeze would be given how many shorts will cover and the daily average volume?

Thanks for taking the time to read this.",8

16-05-16,4jnpx0,calling insurance company experts - question on reserves for investment portfolio,"Hi, long story short, the company I work for also controls a life insurance company. 

When I asked about them investing in equities, I was told that the reserve requirements for what they'd need to set aside for stock investments are 100% at the holding company level, but only 30% if it's done through a subsidiary - he called it ""the service company."" 

He compared this to a 1% reserve requirement for high grade/AAA bonds, explaining that this is why most insurance companies hold mostly bonds.

I thought the reason most insurance companies hold bonds was because of less volatility and ""risk"" ? And more liquid than buying up a bunch of stocks, when they need to sell investments to pay out claims for example.

Can anyone comment on the validity of these reserve requirements? It's a life insurance company.

On the other hand, you hear that MBIA is buying back distressed Puerto Rico debt (which they insured) at huge discounts in its investment portfolio, which effectively eliminates much of their liability if PR defaults. How is MBIA able to do this? I'd think municipal bond insurance regulatory requirements for their investment portfolios would be much more stringent than a life insurance company.",1

16-05-17,4jter7,Tax Loss Harvesting and wealthfront,"Please pardon the possibly newbie question.   

Wealthfront advertises their tax loss harvesting service for their personal investment accounts (I assume its available for retirement accounts as well).

However, I do not understand the perceived benefit of tax loss harvesting for a personal investment account.   I do understand it as a way to basically offset any realized gain at the end of the year.   However, Wealthfront seems to be advertising it as an investment strategy (yielding on average .5 - 1.5% more than those that do not choose to harvest tax losses, as they say last time i checked) to the tune of harvesting tax losses and promptly re-investing the money from the sale into a similar, yet technically different fund to maintain exposure to that particular category of fund.   This doesn't make sense to me because if I don't have any realized gains to offset, then all I'm really doing is re-establishing my basis at a lower amount while getting a tax write-off against my income.  I will then have to pay taxes on the difference between my original basis and my new basis when I do actually sell the shares somewhere down the road.   

In other words, it looks as if all I'm getting is a tax write-off now, in exchange for a higher taxable amount later.... this isnt really an investment strategy is it?   

The only way I can see this working out is if you take your tax savings and invest it into your account, but Wealthfront doesn't really provide you a way to do this.... i.e. its on you to compare your taxes and invest the difference you save by taking the loss.



At best, its the age old discussion of taxes now vs taxes later (trying to balance the chances of the decreased tax rates when you aren't making any money in old age, vs government propensity to raise taxes.... and the resultant discussion between taking the tax hit now, or later).

16-05-17,4jtg9s,How to choose a stock,"To make a long story short, I just entered the stock market about two weeks ago and made only two purchases so far ($NVDA &amp; $MGT). Still hold both and have been a great success for me. With that being said, I didn't purchase any of these because of my own DD or my own research, but rather from just peoples suggestions (even though I believe the jumps on $MGT was because of the trust in McAfee, wasn't much DD). My portfolio is only those two stocks as I mentioned, but I want to diversify it more and don't know which stocks to choose. I'm not asking anyone to give me specific stocks to invest in, but how do you find a stock that you want to purchase for a short term in a couple days/weeks? Where do I even start to choose which stock to look at? Do I just have to wait for big news, like McAfees' news, do make a jump on a stock? 

Even though the suggestions on $NVDA &amp; $MGT have made me money, being new to this and young, my knowledge from here can only expand and I want to be able to make purchases on my own without having to first hear about it from someone else. I'm sure when a suspected jump in a price occurs, using $NVDA &amp; $MGT as examples again, people have more of that in their portfolio that doesn't make insane numbers but still makes them profit, and that's what I want to do. If I were to sell those two stocks right now, I would have nothing in my portfolio, and again, that's not what I'm looking for.

I apologize if this is all over the place but I hope what I was trying to say got through. With all that being said, I'm not looking into any long term investments, so I would need advice on how to choose stocks that could make me profit in a couple days/weeks.

I thank you in advance for any help. ",3

16-05-17,4jtjlr,9/11 Bill passes senate - market impact? (S.2040 aka JASTA),"As always, those cis whites in the [ORIGINAL freedom tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol) have come up with another way to make other countries love America. The Senate [passed](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/18/us/politics/senate-passes-bill-that-would-expose-saudi-arabia-to-legal-jeopardy-over-9-11.html?_r=1) a bill that would let people sue Saudi Arabia for 9/11 ~~even though they definitely had nothing to do with it~~ since they definitely did 9/11. Somehow a court has ruled that suing another country for something that happened 15 years ago is legal, even though that is, in layman's terms, mind-blowingly retarded. 

I only post this because the Saudis have very non-subtly threatened to sell off over 700 billion dollars in US-investments, which I'm sure would have some kind of impact on the market, but what kinds of effects are we potentially looking at here? Oil? Dollar value? Other shit I can't think of? 

A lot of this momentum obviously comes from those recent [documents](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/13/september-11-saudi-arabia-congressional-report-terrorism) that showed a link between low level saudi officials and Al-Qaeda. There are also 28 pages of still-classified reporting from the 9/11 Commission Report that, according to one senator who has read said pages ""rearrange my understanding of history"" - call it the smoking gun tape if you're a fan of Watergate. 

Anyhow, some fuck-stick senator from texas said there's nooooo way the saudis would be dumb enough take such a big hit just to prove a point, but we also never thought people would vote for a [president from a state that has a lot of oil and no good science textbooks](https://youtu.be/VFX-dKpcDz8?t=18), and look how that turned out.

On a serious note, I know Obama has said he'll veto S2040 but let's get some hypotheticals rolling here. It passed the senate unanimously so it's actually somewhat feasible that a veto could be overridden.

That's fine, I now hold a stake in the underlying assets owned by the index ETF that used to be held by Alice.

But what happens if lots of people want to buy in and drive the price of the index ETF up beyond the underlying price of the assets owned by the index? Presumably at some point the ETF itself has to create new shares and sell them, then use the capital to buy more assets?

2) How and when do they decide to release more shares?  
3) I take it the same process works in reverse if lots of personal investors are selling and the price dives?  
4) Could a sneaky ETF operator deliberately allow the price to rise out of step with the underlying assets and pocket the money? What safeguards are in place to prevent this?

I'm trying to find a way to screen multiple stocks at once using a custom formula in real time (or as close to it as possible). I have a method right now, but it’s really inefficient:

    1. Start with all stocks.
    2. Reduce the number of choices to a manageable level using FinViz.com, based on average volume, volatility, etc.
    3. Review each individual qualifying stock using four different modules on TradingView.com, looking for trends, momentum, etc.

The current method takes at least five minutes to review each stock. It’s impractical for quick trading – if I have ten candidates, it takes about an hour to get through them all. I’m trying to speed up the process so that I can review more stocks faster.

Does anyone know of a method that would allow me to:

* write a custom algorithm with multiple inputs to evaluate a given stock,
* evaluate more than one stock at a time using said algorithm, and let me
* rank-order the stocks by the algorithm’s output? Major bonus points if this method can also
* connect to a database and automatically import the algorithm's inputs.

They also released an injectable interleukin allergy injection this year that is currently only in the hands of veterinary dermatologists but will likely move into the general sector this year. This would be for dogs refractory to Apoquel and would be given monthly.
I'm a veterinarian in a smaller 3 doctor practice and we have gone through tons of Apoquel this year already. I'm hoping this really bolsters the company's bottom line since just about every vet I know is carrying and selling.

Alright so basically I have been offered a job at ""es-investments"" to find and acquire new people that would pay for their life insurance program rather than siding with the ""bad banks"" that steal their money. Instead of getting 1-2% interest they offer their ""investors"" 20-25% (after 10-15 years) or even more which they achieve by investing into Mostly gold and or properties as well as other resources. Apparently, so have I been told, they don't mess about with their investors money nor their winnings either but do charge them a one time fee at the beginning which I am not really sure but from what I understand is around 500-1k€. This immediately rang a bell for me. Next I was told that there is no binding contract and I can leave at any time which makes me to believe that they are simply searching for interchangeable agents who do their running. What do you guys think? Am I right with being cautious and does this really sound similar to a Ponzi Scheme or am I just paranoid? If this was a stupid thing to ask don't ridicule me too hard as I am just trying to learn the ropes with investment. (P.S.: English is not my native language) Thank you guys very much for the great content on this subreddit.",0

As promised, this is the Research Request thread.  

**I have access to Moody's, S&amp;P, Morgan Stanley, ~~Credit Suisse~~ (might be banned after calling the sales guy a fucking pussy, need to check), JP Morgan, Citigroup, Barclays, ~~Jefferies (I think)~~, and the all mighty (LUL) Goldman Sachs.** I will do my best to go thru them for all names. Interestingly, I left out Bloomberg research cause they aggregate a bunch of garbage and polish it up and call it ""due diligence"". Bloomberg is company that aggregates real time information and they are good at that, but their research is subpar for my experience. If you really want BB research for a stock let me know otherwise I'm sticking with the investment banks.

#RULES

1. **NO fucking Penny stocks**, noone covers this garbage.

7.  ONE NAME PER COMMENT

16-05-17,4jqvtx,Tuesday Pre-market FYI,"My last post like this got spam filtered so hopefully this gets out as it's posted.  Happy Tuesday shitheads... lots going on this morning so here's the low down.

Tuesday's important economic reports:

**Consumer Price Index**:  In short, how much does shit cost?  Does the US Dollar have more or less purchasing power?  [Here is the data as of 8:30am EST.](http://bloomberg.econoday.com/byshoweventfull.asp?fid=472091&amp;cust=bloomberg-us&amp;year=2016&amp;lid=0&amp;prev=/byweek.asp#top)  Implications of this report are far reaching because higher than expected inflation means the fed is open to raise rates.  At least that's how this nigga is interpreting it.  Equity futures went red as the dollar index jumped simultaneously putting downward pressure on commodities.  Things are leveling out now, but not sure how this will impact the trading day.

**Housing Starts**:

What number of construction starts for new residential buildings?  [Here are the housing starts numbers](http://bloomberg.econoday.com/byshoweventfull.asp?fid=472175&amp;cust=bloomberg-us&amp;year=2016&amp;lid=0&amp;prev=/byweek.asp#top) which came in above consensus, but stayed within the consensus range.  Permits for new construction actually fell under consensus, but within the consensus range.  I would interpret this report as mixed.  While the housing starts numbers look good, further analysis is saying this is not much of an increase and different areas and types of housing are actually cooling off.

**Industrial Production**:

You've probably heard that the US economy is primarily consumption based.  While true, those consumers need jobs to buy shit so Industrial Production is an indicator of the economy's health.  This report was just released [and can be found here](http://bloomberg.econoday.com/byshoweventfull.asp?fid=472294&amp;cust=bloomberg-us&amp;year=2016&amp;lid=0&amp;prev=/byweek.asp#top).  You can already see the trend is down so this final market moving report before market open could really set the tone as to how the indexes and commodities move today.  The downward trend has appeared to reverse with all reports coming above or at the top of estimates.

Per Bloomberg:

&gt;Importance
Industrial production and capacity utilization indicate not only trends in the manufacturing sector, but also whether resource utilization is strained enough to forebode inflation. Also, industrial production is an important measure of current output for the economy and helps to define turning points in the business cycle (start of recession and start of recovery).

I'm not making any trading suggestions so don't interpret this as advice.  Just a good way to fill your dome with knowledge before going all in $NUGT or $SPY puts faggot's delight style.  Sometimes reading this shit confuses me more than anything because it's hard to know how the market interprets good news as good, bad news as bad, or when bad news = good and good = bad.  Either way I'm guessing we'll have interesting trading again today.  Good luck and may the Yolo be with you!

Edit:

Pretty crazy day, huh?  [This faggot is running his mouth](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/fed-officials-stress-that-june-meeting-is-live-2016-05-17?link=MW_latest_news) about the rate hike, that's why everything besides the VIX and Dollar futures is eating a dick right now.",60

16-05-17,4jolrx,how to reconcile investing with a trip to the grocery store,"Likely a dumb question, but this drives me to distraction. I wonder how other investors deal with this. We've got a handful of millions in investible assets spread across asset classes. We amassed it by working hard, being frugal and investing patiently.

Here's the weird issue I find myself facing: my investment decisions are a completely different scale that my regular life. Recently, I've finished remodelling an apartment for rental. I priced the remodel before buying it; no surprises there. That cost  aboout 35k. After I poured all that money into it, I got a tenant so the gross yield is about 7%. It worked to plan. 

Now, I need to buy a TV for the apartment, according to the contract. I've got an older TV at home and have no plans to waste money on a new one, but I've got to splash out for a TV for my tenant. 35k is a lot of money for me, but I find myself spending it in my investing life. I can't reconcile the two. I balk at $100 lunches, but spend decades of nice lunches in a month remodelling an apartment.

Losses on investments are even harder. I held emerging markets funds for the past years. Over the years, EMs have been a big part of my success. However, these were in a long slow dip and it was time to stop the bleed. After having a big climb, the price had fallen back by the price of a new porsche boxster ... I drive a 10yo toyota. It bugs me, even though I've made the cost of a small fleet of boxters in the same markets. It kills me to give one back.

At the grocery store, we check the prices on peanut butter and try to save a few pennies, but in my investing life, porsches come and go. I just took a hit on some options contracts - nothing out of scale, but it rattles me - this is getting to the point I'm having trouble sleeping. THis is harder than I expected and it's not like I can get off the ride.",1

To make a long story short, I just entered the stock market about two weeks ago and made only two purchases so far ($NVDA &amp; $MGT). Still hold both and have been a great success for me. With that being said, I didn't purchase any of these because of my own DD or my own research, but rather from just peoples suggestions (even though I believe the jumps on $MGT was because of the trust in McAfee, wasn't much DD). My portfolio is only those two stocks as I mentioned, but I want to diversify it more and don't know which stocks to choose. I'm not asking anyone to give me specific stocks to invest in, but how do you find a stock that you want to purchase for a short term in a couple days/weeks? Where do I even start to choose which stock to look at? Do I just have to wait for big news, like McAfees' news, do make a jump on a stock?

Even though the suggestions on $NVDA &amp; $MGT have made me money, being new to this and young, my knowledge from here can only expand and I want to be able to make purchases on my own without having to first hear about it from someone else. I'm sure when a suspected jump in a price occurs, using $NVDA &amp; $MGT as examples again, people have more of that in their portfolio that doesn't make insane numbers but still makes them profit, and that's what I want to do. If I were to sell those two stocks right now, I would have nothing in my portfolio, and again, that's not what I'm looking for.

I apologize if this is all over the place but I hope what I was trying to say got through. With all that being said, I'm not looking into any long term investments, so I would need advice on how to choose stocks that could make me profit in a couple days/weeks.

I think western civilization is going to shit and I'd like to short it. I'm hedged against an abrupt crash mostly via faggots delight, but not a long slow grind. This shit is taking forever to crash and I'm starting to think it never will, in numeric face value.

16-05-18,4judej,Shorting China,"Here are some of my partially organized thoughts on the world market that I would like to discuss with all of you.

From an undergraduate economics student in the US:

I was traveling in the Middle East a year ago and talked to some business men in Hong Kong who told me that some cities in China in which half of their buildings are empty because the local magistrates keep building to show growth, even though it's not necessary. Local magistrates report to the central government that everything is growing and everybody is happy- investors are happy.

I've been reading the news lately and it's not even a secret that this sort of fake growth is happening in China, which is why their president is attempting to slow down unnecessary production. However, in addition to all of this, China's debt to GDP is around 240% now, which is around where the US was in 2009 (correct me if I'm wrong). Around &lt;60% debt/gdp, I've read anyway, is considered ""healthy."" Extreme levels of debt are indicators of bubbles because the debt is outstripping the growth and if the growth holding it up for so long was inaccurate to begin with= bubble. Go look at the small cap ETFs suffering much more than the large cap indices right now, I.E probably not propped up by government.

Furthermore, futures trading in China is an all time high, commodity prices are up quite a bit, which we all know is a response to market fear. Gold, for example, is up 25% this year according to bloomberg. 

Moreover, the Dow/s&amp;P market averages are near highs with no real catalyst to drive them higher. The s&amp;p 500 has a 0% growth rate between may-october every year since it's inception, not to mention that interest rates are possibly going to go up again in June. Higher interest rates generally drive stocks downward and is a good stabilizer in strong bull trends(not great now). In summation, U.S. summer downturn like last year probably won't help China either, or is in response to China.. not ignoring oil.

I believe that the Chinese government is trying to correctly remedy the situation, but if it doesn't work out, here are a few of my rough thoughts. 

First option: 

Buying into the inverse of  China ETF of indices. The volume on these is super low and I don't want to touch them only because of that.

Second option: 

Buying into commodities such as gold/silver. I'm not sure if buying into indices on this, or actual mining companies/holders is better?

Third option:

Your thoughts?

16-05-18,4judfp,"Moving inactive 401k from Fidelity, to a Vanguard IRA?","Been holding onto an ex-employer 401k account for over 5yrs, maintained by Fidelity, due to what appeared to be a comfortable (read: decent return) distribution of funds. 

Having recently stumbled across this subreddit, after having read through its FAQ, and - most importantly - having looked more closely and finding fairly high fees charged on this 401k ""maintenance"", I was wondering if a move from it to an IRA (Roth??, or not??) with Vanguard may be worth. I would prefer a pre-defined ""package"", with retirement target around 2025. 

Any suggestions on how to research for the proper ""package"" justifying the transfer fees, the maintenance fees, the type of IRA and - all in all - whether such a move is worth doing?

EDIT: I realized how much of a newbie I am (hope some of you are still willing to follow-up - and thank you for all responses, so far!! - great advises). I should have provided quantifiable criteria for my statements. Why have I said high fees? Because the [Feex](https://www.feex.com) report tool I subscribed to keeps informing me, on a monthly basis, about a $300-$400/month fees for the approx $450K in my old 401k, and only in the range of $10-15/month for an approx $150K I have in an active 401K. The apparent ratio disparity got me to state what I did earlier. Do these numbers even justify my original Q? Considering this, would you advise on other options? I do not have an IRA, of either alternatives (Roth or regular).",10

This money is going to be held long term, and I plan to continue contributing $1K/mo for as long as my income remains at this level.

Might I be better served to split the money between Intl and/or Small/Mid Cap ETFs like IJT/IJH, etc.?

Yesterdays action of a massive sell off at the high of the day shows that there are still plenty of sellers looking for an exit at these prices. Weekly momentum is starting to roll over to the down side and daily momentum while still pushing up is slowing. I think the selling pressure will soon take out the buyers and we retrace and head back to at least the 50 SMA near $1250 before maybe making a move higher again. 


Today we seem to be holding on to the 7 SMA ($1272) as support which is bullish for tomorrow so long as we close above it but the intraday sell offs are increasing and momentum is stalling and I think the sellers are going to win in the short term.

Sack Lunch Productions owns several different companies and events. I’m not going to talk about the other investments because that’s not where the money is. Like many of you, if there’s no money to be made then frankly I could care less. The companies’ continued growth is from these events. Sack Lunch owns Slide the City (1,000 foot long water slide), Color Me Rad (5k color race), The Dirty Dash (mud and obstacle run), The Lantern Fest (nighttime party with lantern lighting and launch) and Trike Riot. This is where their profits are coming from and what causes them to continually beat earnings expectations. Slide the City is their flagship event and is expected to surpass Color Me Rad in ticket sales this summer. Color Me Rad is the only one I ever heard of mainly because of attention whores on FB and IG posting pics from this event. Lantern Fest is relatively new and increasing in popularity. Enough of my opinions.

As Jimmy McGill says, let us get down to brass tacks. As of now there are 69 Slide the City, 27 Color Me Rad, 11 Dirty Dash, and 19 Lantern Fest events where people can buy tickets for in 2016.

CEO, Richard Surber, noted, ""Our top line revenues came in at nearly $1M more than we projected for 2015. Even more impressive, SAKL posted a small net profit in the face of all the expenses related to the acquisition of Springbok Holdings and a number of extraordinary costs related to the start-up of our other event endeavors. In December, SAKL increased its ownership from 66.7% to 100% in each of the following entities: Slide the City, LLC, Slide the City Franchising, LLC, Slide the City Canada, LLC, and The Lantern Fest, LLC.

Slide the City has expanded their market with events in Malaysia that were hugely popular. Slide the City events are scheduled in China in the near future; as well as, many other countries after that.

16-05-18,4jvagc,The Fannie Mae(fnma)/Freddie Mac(fmcc) 3rd Amendment Judge Lamberth Appeal,"The first question the court should answer to reach its decision is, how much power does FHFA have as conservator?  It must narrow down the absolute limits of what the conservator can do to accomplish the goals of conservatorship.  


The government alludes to the power of the conservator as being almost absolute.  They never say ""FHFA can do anything it wants as conservator"", but they come pretty close.  The defendants never draw any lines, or set any self-imposed limits, on the powers of conservator in their oral arguments.  


Shareholder's can argue about what good faith and fair dealing are, but only HERA and FHFA can set the boundaries for when a deal made by the conservator exceeds its authority.  The Constitution and outside laws can also act as barriers on the powers of conservator.  But for the purposes of handling the analysis in a sequential order, those factors should be analyzed last.   


So ignoring, for now, other laws and Constitutional limits on the powers of the conservator, the court should examine if FHFA has ever communicated self-imposed limits on its power as conservator.  If HERA gives FHFA unlimited power to accomplish the goals of conservatorship, the court should assume that its statements about how it will conduct the conservatorships have unlimited credibility as well.  


If the stated public intentions of FHFA as conservator are not consistant over time, and the actions of the conservator materially contradict its stated previous intentions, then FHFA creates the conditions by which a court can find that it wasn't acting in good faith and did not make fair deals.  


If the government argues that HERA only allows challenges of conservator power that exceed its authority, then the test for when its actions may be review-able could be when it directly references other statutes or rules that it will not use its conservatorship power to ignore.  


So now I will show examples of when FHFA makes statements that define the scope of its authority and/or references other legislation and existing rules.  I will go in chronological order starting in 2008.  


""In addition, as conservator, FHFA assumed the authority of the management and boards of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during the period of the conservatorship. However, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac continue to operate legally as business corporations and FHFA has delegated to the chief executive officers and boards of directors responsibility for much of the day-to-day operations of the companies. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac must follow the laws and regulations governing financial disclosure, including the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission. - Excerpt from 2008 ""history of the conservatorships www.fhfa.gov "" 


http://www.fhfa.gov/Conservatorship/Pages/History-of-Fannie-Mae--Freddie-Conservatorships.aspx""


The above section is highlighted for a number of reasons.   It happens in 2008 just after the conservatorships are initiated.  FHFA states that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac"" must follow the laws and regulations governing financial disclosure"".


So the court should ask the next obvious question.  Has Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed the laws and regulations governing financial disclosure?  Well it stands to reason that if it had followed all disclosures laws that we would know why FHFA has made the decisions it has made on behalf of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  Securities laws require the companies to disclosure all material information about their operations that have the potential to alter the value of their securities.  


Those laws exist so investors can know what is happening to and at the companies.   Since FHFA is effectively the companies, it has to tell the public the reason it is making its decisions.  And even if it believes that it is not obligated to disclose the reasons for its decision because it thinks HERA allows it to do whatever it chooses to do, it has limited the scope of what it can do by stating to the public that it believes it is obligated to follow already existing financial disclosure laws.


Here are excerpts of statements from James Lockhart that come from his public announcement concerning his decision to place the companies into conservatorship:

1.  ""Second, the Enterprises will be allowed to grow their guarantee MBS books without limits and continue to purchase replacement securities for their portfolios, about $20 billion per month without capital constraints.""

Ok so why is that statement important?  Well because of arguments that the defendants have made in court.  They gave the Enterprises marching orders and the authority to grow their guarantee mortgage portfolio's ""without limits"" and the ability to maintain the scale of their retained MBS portfolio at a rate of ""20 billion per month without capital constraints"". 

1.  With FHFA in power the management of Fannie and Freddie did not have the power to say no to this directive.  Lockhart compelled the GSEs to deploy their capital in a practically unlimited way.  The argument for the necessity of conservatorship cuts both ways.  

If market conditions posed enough of a threat to the GSEs to necessitate their conservatorship, it stands to reason that the decision by the FHFA to have the GSEs increase the scale of their financial commitment in those same market conditions increased the risk to the financial prospects of the Enterprises.  

There are only a limited range of outcomes that could happen because of this decision by the conservator.  The assets purchased and mortgages guarantees provided would eventually show a profit, or the GSEs would lose even more money than they already had and would have an even weaker financial condition. 

 And because the backstop for those potential losses would be the Treasury commitment provided at 10 percent interest, the costs of both that commitment and the commitment made in the third amendment should at minimum be reduced for two reasons.  

The first reason being that the cost of the financial commitment with Treasury made the decision of FHFA to have the enterprises provide unlimited liquidity a bad decision even though the assets were profitable in microcosm.  

Secondly, because market conditions likely made the decision by FHFA to have the GSEs deploy unlimited capital a potentially costly decision, the decision was unlikely to be the optimal path for FHFA to take to assure the solvency of the companies in an absolute sense even if the cost of capital were competitive.  

The defendant's characterize the 3rd amendment as possibly a ""bad business decision"".  They only concede even that point as a possibility.  Which is pretty much the only way they can characterize the 3rd amendment without either lying to the court, or admitting that the FHFA is run by incompetent people.  But no matter how they try to characterize the decision of FHFA to agree to the third amendment, the weight of the evidence supports intent over incompetence very heavily.

Approximately 3 months after HERA passed, the Treasury secretary at the time, Hank Paulson, made the decision in consultation with the president, George W. Bush, to takeover operations of the companies and to place them into conservatorship. In his book 'On the Brink' he characterizes his mentality in making the decision by recalling a conversation he had with the president just before taking control of the enterprises. The quote is ""Do they know it's coming, Hank?"" President Bush asked me. ""Mr. President,"" I said, ""we're going to move quickly and take them by surprise. The first sound they'll hear is their heads hitting the floor."" To read a more in-depth excerpt of the decision: http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Books/book-excerpt-brink-henry-paulson-jr/story?id=9713451

Wow, guillotine death references by their primary lender, the United States Treasury Department.  Seems kinda adversarial.  It also seriously damages the credibility of the public statement by James Lockhart about conservatorship being the decision of FHFA.  

The history matters because Treasury claims the 3rd amendment was a good faith decision meant to save the Enterprises from a ""death spiral""  But to even arrive at this ""bad business decision"" FHFA had to make numerous other ""bad business decisions"" between 2008 - 2012.  Here they are:

1.  It had to agree to a 10 percent dividend on borrowed funds from Treasury as well as give up 79.9 of the common stock in both GSEs.

2.  It had to ignore the Enterprises AAA credit ratings and 400 billion dollars in unpledged Mortgage Backed Securities that would have allowed the GSEs to pay off the 10 percent senior preferred stock.  This decision alone cost the GSEs almost 100 billion in interest payments and dividends pre-networth sweep.  And another 100 billion post networth sweep.  

3.  It had to make them provide ""unlimited"" liquidity in a risky mortgage market.  Essentially made them buy assets that paid 5 percent interest which ballooned the senior preferred stock liquidation preference at 10 percent interest. 

4.  It had to ignore the GSEs access to the discount window at the FED.  

And it had to do all this over two different presidential administrations and two different conservators.

16-05-18,4jvd29,Thoughts on Dollar Cost Averaging Timeline?,"**tl;dr** For a young investor with a long time horizon and global portfolio, how long a time do you suggest I dollar cost average in over. (Please don't just quote the 1-year Vanguard research). 

I have built a (currently) theoretical portfolio for retirement (which is 40 or so years off for me). The porfolio is, more or less, an all-world portfolio with a slightly stronger bias toward emerging markets and away from Europe. 

With interest rates at such low levels, future US increases imminent, and resultant valuations pricing for low future returns I am not stoked about pumping a lot of money into the plan at the moment, so I think dollar-cost-averaging is the way to go.

However, I can't decide how long a period to do it over. Here is the relevant research I am aware of:
- Vanguard's study that says for one year periods, it is better to buy at the start of the period than to dollar cost average in
- Warren Buffett saying ""if you dollar cost average in to a low cost ETF over a decade you will do better than 90% of investors who start at the same time"" (paraphrasing from memory)
- Benjamin Graham suggests that defensive investors should not wait for the market to become low to buy. Rather, they should put money in when the market is not at an exceptionally high level and when they have the cash to invest. 

Of Grahams tests for market level, central value suggests approximately fair valuation. Trend line analysis which I believe I have been able to improve on (due to using real, dividend reinvestment included returns, my r2 is much higher than his would have been) also suggests about fair valuation. However, his upper limit for a multiple to pay for any company (no more than 20x its trailing 5 year average earnings) is exceeded by the SPY right now if you throw out questionable accounting adjustments.

My thought: follow Warren Buffett's advice and start dollar cost averaging in over the next decade, until such a point as all of Graham's tests suggest the market is at a fair or attractive valuation, at which point I will put the rest of my cash on the sidelines in. 

Do you guys think this makes sense? Can you offer a better alternative?",0

&gt; Even with a yield below 2 percent, Pioneer Investment Management and BlueBay Asset Management recently bought the securities and see yields dropping even lower. Allianz Global Investors said it purchased 50-year French and Belgian bonds. While investors in the longest debt typically are pension plans and insurers, figures from Spain’s Treasury showed a greater proportion of its sale of 50-year bonds last week were snapped up by other money managers including hedge funds.

&gt; Ireland, which was jostling for independence from Britain a century ago, sold a 100-year bond in March at a yield below what investors got five years ago for a 10-year bund from AAA-rated Germany.

&gt; “We think that yields can continue to grind lower,” said Dowding, a partner and money manager at the company. “In a world where euro-zone investors are really facing the fact that there is very little yield to be had in many assets, there is that appetite for more ‘yieldy’ assets you can get from longer-duration issues.”

16-05-18,4jy5ej,Stop-loss Lesson,"I've been trading stocks for about three days now (thanks Robinhood) and love the fact that I can play around with about 40 bucks and use the market as a basic learning toy. 

I realized the stop loss function today and used it on $HERO when it was at 2.16 to sell at 1.92 (10 cents less than I bought at 2.02). I was watching it when it dipped like 20 cents to 1.88 in a matter of seconds and then immediately recovered to 1.97 before I had a chance to cancel the sell order. 

Obviously this is the reason why penny stocks can be poor investment tools (mostly, nothing is black and white etc) but what is the cause of such a quick dip like that?

16-05-18,4jw20n,Survey : American CEOs and lobbyists of large corporations prefer Hillary Clinton to Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders,"&gt;* CEOs and lobbyists prefer Clinton to Trump or Sanders

&gt;* Bill Reinsch, who represented corporations ranging from Cisco to General Electric to Procter &amp; Gamble as head of the National Foreign Trade Council, said Mrs Clinton would be best for his member corporations, but he picked her with little enthusiasm as the “less bad” choice.

&gt;* “I hate to put it in negative terms, but it’s because the other two are so terrible,” he said, referring to Mr Trump and Bernie Sanders, the self-declared socialist who continues to vie for the Democratic nomination.

&gt;* He says Clinton is the one of the three that understands the issues the best and will be the best listener to the needs of corporations.

&gt;* Donald Trump trounced his GOP rivals in part by impugning an establishment alliance between Republicans and business groups, which are accustomed to financing political campaigns and having a pro-corporate nominee who wants open trade, lower deficits and smaller government.

&gt;* 63% of respondents say Mrs Clinton has the best trade policies, with the rest of them declining to pick a candidate, even though the Democrat last year switched positions by turning against a new Pacific Rim trade deal, the TPP, which big business is desperate to see.

&gt;* “The hope is that Hillary Clinton would pivot back to her pre-election stance on trade agreements and globalisation,” said one trade association chief.

&gt;* 53% say Bernie Sanders is the worst candidate for the corporations.

16-05-17,4jt0ns,Warren Buffet Invests like a b****.,"Listen, hear me out. Berkshire Hathaway's investment of around $9 Billion confused me as much as the rest of the investing community. I speak on behalf of my mind by expressing my internet freedom. Oh hilarity, how dare you pursue.  (Links below)

Why? two words. Snap Chat. They are so integrated within iPhone and android devices that you would have to be deceased not to use it. Since the public iPhone 5c break-in, being an older IOS, the US government successfully entered the device. Therefore The US government had a disagreement with the Apple (APPL) on its phone policy. This is not the first time this has happened. 

Not until recently hearing that event, i realized that apple is the most secure operating system in the world. Pretty big statement huh? The US government had to outsource a company to assist. That is cool and all, but what does this have to do with Snap Chat?

Snap Chat had their servers shook all over the internet. Nudes 4 days. So that put a pretty big damper on the security of snap chat. The co-ceos have been attempting to raise funds and go public, but not for security sake. So why would B. Hathaway drop 9 billion?  

Apple had a recent IOS update where there was quick pic, audio and video messages within iMessage. To my understanding and my best bet; I would not only see an opportunity, but better security for everyone. Once the company goes public, the IPO will soar. While apple cannot wait to sink its teeth into it. The connection is odd, but you kinda see the straight line. Let me know what you think!

16-05-18,4jz2up,How to trade NUGT and DUST the rest of the week,"Since my gf Yellen decided to be a slut and fuck everyone in NUGT, I'll give my opinion on what I think will follow.

Tomorrow we should see NUGT go down a bit more, but mid-day it should turn into a buy. Whenever the fed speaks about what they're ""going"" to do everyone freaks the fuck out and gold gets very volatile. Then everyone forgets about it and gold consolidates.

For example: who remembers what happened two weeks ago? Someone from the fed opened his faggot mouth sending NUGT from 100 to 88 in one day. In the next two days we watched NUGT go to 110. 

I know Yellen has a bigger dick than that guy so it will move gold a bit more but whatever that slut said today means nothing. All that matters now is how well the market does until the June meeting. If it does shitty, no rate hike. If it does well, rate hike. 

Until then, Yellen can go fuck herself",3

16-05-18,4jz3vn,Short Lending Club Stock $LC,"Below is an analysis of Lending Club $LC. Management owns 52% of the company, ""investors"" in the notes don't actually own the notes, and the investigations are piling up.

Directly from Lending Club's Prospectus:
https://www.lendingclub.com/info/prospectus.action

&gt;If we were to become subject to a bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the rights of the holders of the Notes could be uncertain, and payments on the Notes may be limited and suspended or stopped. **The Notes are unsecured and holders of the Notes do not have a security interest in the corresponding Loans or the proceeds of those corresponding Loans.** The recovery, if any, of a holder on a Note may be substantially delayed and substantially less than the principal and interest due and to become due on the Note. Even funds held by us in accounts “in trust for” the holders of Notes may potentially be at risk.

&gt;In a bankruptcy or similar proceeding of us there may be uncertainty regarding whether a holder of a Note has any priority right to payment from the corresponding Loan. **The Notes are unsecured and holders of the Notes do not have a security interest in the corresponding Loan or the proceeds of the corresponding Loan.**

Everyone understands that retail ""investors"" don't own the payment streams from borrowers, right?

The first question in lending is... Who is the counterparty...? 

I bet it's not who you thinks it is with P2P lending.

Many believe that they are buying the note and the credit risk is with the borrower. However, a bank actually underwrites the loan and funds it. Lending Club then purchases the loan from the bank. It uses the site as a way to ""sell"" the loan.

However, LC doesn't sell you the loan. It takes your money, and you are an unsecured creditor of Lending Club. If you owned the note, it would be held in trust, in a bankrupt remote entity, and possibly with cash collateral. See the image below and you can see it is not. The loan stops with LC. 

http://s32.postimg.org/dqakyd51x/image.png

They make money 4 ways:

1: Servicing the loan. At least 50 bps.
2: Spread. The note is likely at least 100 bps higher than what the ""investor"" is buying.
3: Gain on ""Sale"": It likely collects about 300 bps for each loan, but the rights of the loan stay with LC.
4: Fees. The borrower pays fees for the loan.

""Investors"" are taking a risk that LC will pass through all the funds to the investor.

""Investors"" are unsecured creditors and are second to last in line if LC defaults. Common stock holders are last. The bank is a secured creditor to LC and thus will take possession of the loans if LC defaults and be first in line.

Being the second lowest in the capital position is no place to invest, as a creditor. If you does want to invest like that, buy some High Yield junk bonds.

Short the stock, buy puts, sell calls, stop reinvestment of loans and withdraw money from the platform.

Currently, I'm long 5 of the 5/20 $4 Puts and going to load up on some longer dated puts tomorrow morning and possibly some bear call spreads. Got to find some time premium to sell.

anyways, boss (who spends his whole day playing LoL, as far as I can tell, and who also bankrolls cause dad gave him a company) asked for me to come up with a trading strategy.  could be anything.  i majored in econ so i was going to do sector rotation and see how it would play for us (we basically our purely passive, stick people in mutual funds and get our 1.5% fee is all that matters).  i was thinking xlu,k,v,etc. and overweighting based on indicators.

anways, any of you guys have anything interesting that i could try out?  my boss is a slacker, so it doesn't have to be anything sophisticated or polished.  and it would be fun to throw something at him that's completely out of left field.

also, is there really no cursing?  i just saw the new rules.  wtf.

Does anyone have know of a platform other than LinkedIn or Facebook that we can use? If we try to go any further with the Yahoo the group this won't last, I'm thinking that LinkedIn is our best option.

16-05-19,4jzqwm,"CMV: DCF valuation is useful only to create a wide range of intrinsic value, and therefore shouldn't have too much time or thought put into it when deciding to buy a stock","First. Everyone's doing DCF valuations. If everyone's doing them, you probably won't find anything too undervalued or overvalued. At the very least, this should mean that a more useful way to value a company would be something like Bruce Greenwald's method. 

Second. There is no evidence to say that DCF (or any valuation metric) produces the correct valuation. This is because there is no evidence that the market moves in accordance with DCF valuations. Obviously there are many reasons for this, the main one being that every valuation is different. Which leads to my third point:

The discount rate is a huge factor in the valuation. Slight changes in it can significantly change your valuation. So the end valuation isn't going to be too accurate anyway.

Last, there are numerous websites like simply wall street, vuruco, and gurufocus, that provide free DCF valuations. If it's true that the more predictions you average, the closer your prediction is to the real value, it would probably be easier and more accurate to average a bunch of website's DCFs, and only invest if a stock is sufficiently undervalued. 

Because there is absolutely no way to tell if the market is going to move in the direction of your valuation, and because your valuation may be off significantly, it would also make sense to have a pretty huge margin of safety; as in, only invest if the DCF valuation is 60% higher than the actual price. 

Or, you take the DCF valuation as a wide range, and use other factors, such as Earnings Yield or Free Cash flow Yield to determine if the security is at fair value, and then use qualitative analysis to make the bulk of the decision. 

Any way you look at it, DCF is useful only as a wide range of potential true value. Therefore, minimal time and effort should be spent trying to calculate it. 

If that wasn't coherent at all, fine. I just wanted to get my thoughts down. ",2

16-05-18,4jx4f7,First major Malaysian ECF success,"Not so long ago Malaysia has become the first East-Asian country to adopt equity crowdfunding (ECF) legislature. Since then a number of platforms have been opened to public and among them – Crowdo (investment.crowdo.com). It is one of the largest and fastest growing platforms that recently announced the successful completion of its first Equity Crowdfunding offer, raising RM 2.64 million ($500k+).

The Issuer, The Parenthood, launched its Offer in early March with a minimum base target of RM1.05 million (~$250k) and within 17 days it had surpassed this threshold, going on to reach a target achievement of 250%. 
This news coincides with Crowdo’s announcement of its acquisition of its provisional capital market services (CMS) license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). The CMS license will allow Crowdo to offer both debt and equity crowdfunding solutions in Singapore.

This development will have a solid impact on the East Asian market in general and Malaysian market in particular. This creates a precedent of a successful major ECF project which will result in more investors turning to this investing method. This will also provide impetus for other countries of the region to consider implementing ECF legislation on local markets.

Who do you think will be the next country to emvrace ECF?",2

&gt;Yes its true. The only thing moving this stock is the market. Today it was the most traded stock on the entire exchange. Once this volume dies down, this stock will fall down fast and very hard.
Fundamentally, nothing has changed for this company since it was a 0.30 cent stock, besides management restructuring. It's still a completely shit company. No pipeline, no revenue, lots of debt, lots of dillution and more dilution to come for sure.
And McAfee? The guy has spent the last 20 years or so living in Belize and doing drugs. He doesn't know shit about the cyber security space anymore. He's 70 years old and way past his prime. There's a bunch of new cats in the space now and they have far more connections and wealth to use. They can crush him like a cockroach.
I have been day trading the heck out of this stock for over a week now but there is no doubt in my mind that it will fall extremely hard soon. Today is a good example of that when it got rejected at $5 and fell off to $3.70.

I don't have any doubts about them being scammers or anything like that - it's legitimate. 

The way they're operating is, let's say I send them a check for $10000 on January 1st. Over the course of the year I'd earn 2k, which would be split into 4 payments of $500. Their accountant said at the end of the year, he'd send me a 1099-DIV which would show $2k, and I'd report the 2k as qualified dividends. So they'd be subject to federal income tax but nothing else. Meanwhile, any principal would be like a percentage ownership of the company. If I put in 10k now and pull it all out in 5 years, it'd still be 10k, so there'd be no capital gains to pay.

I've never invested in something like this before. Is the above correct? Anything I should be concerned about with this format?

I would like to hear both sides if any of the current top 3 presidential candidates win. By that I mean Trump, Hillary, and Bernie.

This is second hand information but Trump apparently said that he will try and make the obamacare system pay for itself and will lower the price of medicine. Which could mean just the raising of premiums of what people who have to pay for obamacare. But that does not sound like a very republican view point though.

I have no clue, or heard any clue, on Bernie's or Hillary's plans. But since they are democrats I would assume they would leave it as is. Making little if any changes to it and focus on other things.

This morning, that probability rose above 30%. With that shift in expectations, all the other market prices one would expect to move have moved. Emerging-market currencies began falling against the dollar, equities are off, and so on. The market ructions will deliver much the same effect an actual rate hike would. Ironically, the market wobbles might be enough to dissuade the Fed from pulling the trigger when the June meeting rolls around. But a lot of harm will already have been done.

Yall can talk poorly about my Yellen all you want, but she knows her shit, she knows how and what to say to get the market to rationalize without having to actually ~~unzip~~ raise interest rates. Blowjobs for everyone ^suck^my^dick

16-05-19,4k307i,Question about leveraged ETFs,"I keep hearing that they're a bad idea, because even though the gains are high, so are the losses. So, the recommendation is not to go long on these ETFs.

But here is my question. As a stand alone stock, why does that matter. Here is my example. So lets say a certain 3x ETF is currently at $10 a share. So you buy a 100 of those. You've currently invested $1000. And then you forget about that investment. But in your absence the ETF goes up and down, like crazy. It hits $1 a share, and it hits $100 a share many times. Then a year later, you finally remember the $1000 you had put in this and you come back to look at it. And just by chance the ETF is now trading at $10 per share again. So, technically, you've not lost a dime.

Is something wrong in my understanding? Or something else going on in leveraged ETF that I'm unaware of?",3

The news shortly follows an announcement that Apple plans to create a startup accelerator in the Indian tech hub of Bangalore that's focused on iOS app design and development.

The moves could help Apple earn some goodwill as it pushes the Indian government to allow it to import and sell used iPhones (in spite of a recent telecom ministry rejection). Apple is also reportedly planning to open retail stores in Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore within 18 months.

The company isn't going bankrupt anytime soon. Also a company can't have daily 40% gains for a week and a half without some serious downwards momentum and profit taking.

Ask yourself: what's the probability that the stock will rise higher than 2.5$ at some point in the next day to week? Probably pretty high.

I'm new to the stock market scene, having only gotten into researching it the last several weeks and I have begun to read some books on the subject (working on *A Random Walk Down Wall Street* to be followed by *The Intelligent Investor*) The short version: I'm a noob, please be kind and provide usefull feedback. 

**To the discussion!**

**Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (RRGB)** is a sit-down, family-oriented burger chain possessing approximately 500 locations. Recently the compamy missed their estimated **Q1** earnings per share of **$1.11** with a real EPS of **$1.03**. Noted was a 4.1% decrease in customer attendance [source:cnbc](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/17/red-robin-shares-stumble-after-sales-miss.html) The stock proceeded to plummet from a close of **$62.00** on **May 16th** to **$56.43** by **9:30AM May 17th** with a continued descent leading to the current price of **$47.90**. 

Their current P/E ratio **14.82**. They haven't been this low since early **May 2013** besides brief a dip late **2014** that rebounded back into a spike before a correction into the **low 60s**. 

**My questions are these:** are there any glaring factors I should be seeing to justify the magnitude of the downward leap we see in their stock price, and if so what would it be? If it is not entirely justified to the extent that it has dropped, then why not and why would it be a buy if so? 

Thank you all for your responses and feedback

Edit: wording
Edit 2: I have found that late 2015 the company pushed to rennovate their resturants and expand their beer offerings to better serve the increases micro and craft brew customer base. [source:bizjournals](http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2015/10/09/red-robin-acclerates-makeover-increases-beer.html) This correlates and is perhaps a factor in the flattening out of the stock early this year after its drop from last year's spike?

16-05-20,4k7icw,Clone investing,"I recently read Mebane Faber's *Invest With The House: Hacking The Top Hedge Funds*, where he talks about the concept of clone investing. 

Essentially, you find a hedge fund manager you like, you pull their latest 13f filings, and you build a portfolio of their top 10 holdings. 

He profiles 20 hedge funds, back-tests clone portfolios of their top 10 holdings, and they all beat the S&amp;P 500 from 2000-2015.

I believe the site Alphaclone bases some products off of this concept, but from what I have seen, their products are not performing very well right now.

As a strategy, it seems like you're simply taking someone else's investment advice by proxy, and building a long-only portfolio.

Does anyone know of anyone who has built a clone portfolio and had success with it? ",4

16-05-19,4k44ja,"WSB Weekly Herald: John McAfee, Ahmad Chatila Flee Country on Yacht While Under Pursuit by Angry Internet Mob","**John McAfee, Ahmad Chatila Flee Country on Yacht While Under Pursuit by Angry Internet Mob**

*The Wall Street Bets Weekly Herald*

In a chase scene worthy of a UT film major’s second semester project, CEOs John McAfee and Ahmad Chatila (of MGT Capital Investments and Sunedison, respectively) fled their Southampton estates in the early hours of May 19th, in what was reportedly McAfee’s wife’s schnauzer’s 108 ft yacht.  

“It was a hell of a racket,” laughed fund manager Stephen Schwarzman, McAfee’s next door neighbor. “I woke up at about 4 am when I heard gunshots, ran out front and saw Chatila flying through my garden on his golf cart. He was screaming something to John, who I saw spraying a crowd of people with a hose on his front porch.  It almost sounded like ‘those faggots found us’, but that doesn't make any sense.”  (It was later determined that the gunshots were actually backfire from one of the mob's three vehicles, a 1973 Ford Country Squire stuffed with 8 people.)

When I reached out to McAfee’s assistant for comment, she was able to connect me through to his yacht’s satellite phone.  “A reporter, huh?” he asked.  “Let me send my chopper to pick you up - you gotta see this!”  

After a brief helicopter ride to the yacht, located a half nautical mile off of the coast near N.Y.C., I was graciously granted an interview by the pair, as well as a steady supply of Jefferson’s 18.  The scene was particularly strange, as McAfee had ordered the captain to cruise at a mere 3 knots, and a hodgepodge flotilla of small sailboats, canoes, and swan-shaped pedal boats followed about 100 yards off of the stern, with the MAGA-hat-claden boaters screaming obscenities and calling for my host’s heads.  When I joined them, the duo was giggling merrily, tapeing hundred-dollar bills to ping pong balls and throwing them in the yacht’s wake.

Me: Do you know who these people are?

Ahmad: Yeah, I started getting death threats from these guys a few weeks ago after Sunedison went broke.  I had my security team do some research and they found that they’re from a forum called Wallstreet Bets that had been pumping my company’s stock.  They lost a bunch of money and, well, they’re obviously pretty fuckin’ pissed. (laughs)

Me: On that subject, how has your financial situation been since the bankruptcy?

Ahmad: My situation? Where do you think all that money went!?  (laughs again)

Me: Tell me, John, why are they after you as well?  

John: (chuckling) I went on that forum an hour ago and did some reading, looks like they all bought MGT yesterday morning when it gapped up.  I mean, c’mon!

Me: Ouch.  So, why are we going at such a slow speed?  Aren’t you afraid for your safety?  

John:  These fags probably didn’t even have enough money to rent a motorboat to come after us.  I think they got all those [motions airquotes] “boats” from the rental shack on Cooper’s Beach.  

Me: But aren’t you worried that so many people are after you?

John: Worried? I haven’t had this much fun since Belize!  Besides, this isn’t my first rodeo, and it’s definitely the easiest time I’ve ever had goin’ on the lamb.  

John then ended the interview, and suggested that I return on his helicopter which was headed back to pick up some “hookers n’ blow”.  As I walked away, I heard him excitedly tell his friend, “Chachi, get your camera out, two of’em just started fighting over the money balls!”

I'm 23 years old, working in Wealth Management, and look at moving around my pension portfolio a little bit.

I'm currently positioned in what I see as the main growth areas over the next 40 years, i.e. UK Smaller Companies 20%, Emerging Markets 20%, Gold 20% (as a volatility proxy).

The pension provider we use has a limited amount of funds (say, 1,000) and nothing as specific as Biotech funds but there are geographical and thematic funds like property and large caps.

Can anybody throw me some ideas as to some major growth drivers over the next 40 years I may have missed? Obviously emerging markets is one, right? I'm in JP Morgan Emerging Markets.

I was a dumb fuck and knocked my girlfriend up in high school. I never got to go to college, party, fuck random chicks I had work and take care of my kid. Shit job and no money to do anything, barley getting by. 

Fast forward some years girlfriend gets in bad car accident, gets big insurance payout. Cunt thinks shes hot shit now, takes the kid and ditches me. So I did what any true american would, sue that bitch and take half her money - common law marriage is the tits. 

I'm sitting on my ass wondering what to do with 250g's, decide to change everything. Buy suits, a brand new panamera, rent small apartment in big city, spend 8g's on membership to this fucking club called soho house. I sit in there all day eating free food, getting drunk, and socialize with these idiot wannabe actors who think I'm big shit. Start spewing random shit I read on this sub. ""Yeah I net 80% last week selling triple leveraged naked calls."" No fucking clue what I'm saying. 

People start trusting me and asking my story. Tell them I trade for a living, takes me 2 hours each morning then I just sit back and hang out. Tell them I could give them some advice if they need it. 

Finally I convince this guy to paypal me 10 grand, by telling him I can double it for him in 6 days. In 4 days I give him back his money plus  the last 10 of my own. 

Word starts to spread. I travel between new york, chicago and la locations meeting with people talking about shorting the euro and making fucking bank. Get enough customers that I'm paying them with their own money. 

Two weeks ago I decided to exit my trade, told a few people I lost their money then just cancelled my membership and got a new phone number. Locked in my profits. So here I am sitting on my Carver 366 Motor Yacht in palm beach with $800k in my bank account.

Kerrisdale Capital Reports Suspected Tax-Law Violations by DISH Network to the IRS and Announces Conference Call Schedule
 
Disclosure: We are short shares of DISH Network Corporation. Please review our disclosures at the end of our email.
	
	

Today we’re announcing that we sent what’s called a Form 3949-A (Information Referral) to the IRS explaining why we believe DISH is violating tax law by taking approximately a billion dollars per year in tax deductions that it isn’t eligible for. These tax deductions stem from DISH’s amortization of the cost of its spectrum purchases. Some analysts value the cumulative savings over time at $6 per share – roughly 13% of DISH’s current equity value. However, taxpayers are only permitted to amortize intangible assets used in the active conduct of a trade or business, and DISH is not conducting any business with its hoarded spectrum. Strong, recent precedents clearly show that businesses in situations extremely similar to DISH’s – sitting on unused FCC licenses but not actually deploying real networks – aren’t entitled to amortization deductions, and this legal conclusion has held up on appeal. We believe that ultimately DISH will not be able to retain the benefits it’s been claiming, leading to sharply reduced cash flow and additional regulatory headaches.

We’ve posted a copy of our submission to kerr.co/dish-tax.

Conference Call Schedule
We're also hosting a conference call at 4:00pm ET today to review this issue and take questions. To participate in the conference call, dial (888) 390-3983 (US and Canada) or (862) 255-5354 (international) and reference the Kerrisdale Capital conference call.

A replay of the call will be available following the call at kerr.co/dish-may20.",22

16-05-20,4k8fmu,Investment advice for 20yo student,"I have already posted this in /r/personalfinance but they reffered me to you guys.

I am a 20yo physics student in a country in europe where education is free and students also get a few benefits(Slovenia). I live at home meaning I dont spend much on food and nothing on living accomodations. I do spend a bit of money on transportation although my parents help me with my car. I estimated my yearly expenditures(after including some ""fun"" money for the summer) to 2.5k approx. Every year I get dividends from some shares that my grandpa left me, they are somewhere around 1.9k after tax(different each year). I can also work in the summer in my families company where I earn approx 1k/mo. I also have about 13k in a stock fund where I already paid the managment fee. Then I have about another 14k in two banks.

I was wondering how to invest this money better. my father proposed that I buy an appartment to rent it out, he said he would help me get a loan(since I am a student and therefore unemployed). Since I do havey some interest in finance I was also considering investing personaly, but I am afraid of fucking things up. And I am also concerned about the stock market fees, as I hear they are such that small investments cannot ever be profitable due to them.

I appreciate any advice or research material you provide.

Edit: After I read through some more stuff I realise I should clarify a few things so that any advice you may give me is as informed as possible.
The shares I inherited I cannot sell, as they are owned by my mother but she gives me all the after tax profit, it is also a very strong and stabile company.
My objectives for now are to enjoy life until i begin working, and then I wish to have money to do whatever I wish, wheather it be buy a house and settle down debt free, or perhaps start a company. Early retirement also wouldnt hurt. So I definetly have no interest in spending this money in the next 5 or so years.
I am willing to accept risk up to a point, the investments I made on my own with a fund are diversified(into areas) so that I have about 15% of my investment in very secure fields, and around 20% in risky markets whilst the rest is in medium risk areas(like European markets, big companies,..)
I have no assets I havent yet mentioned(car), but as I said, I live with my family and am mostly provided everything, also no expensive girlfriend :), or an inexpensive one for that matter :( 
No debts, also my family is completely debt free(good planning and living within our means).
I cant think of any other relevant information at this time.",20

Had NPR on the radio dial this morning en route to work and they did a piece on Probuphine and it's upcoming FDA approval within the next week (latest 05/27/16):


http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/05/20/478577515/fda-considering-pricey-implant-as-treatment-for-opioid-addiction

Cliffs: 

- Titan Pharmaceuticals ($TTNP) and partner Braeburn Pharmaceuticals is developing implant for opioid addiction.

 
- On Jan. 12, 2016 it received a favorable vote of 12-5 by Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee of the FDA (http://www.titanpharm.com/news/press-releases/detail/146/titan-pharmaceuticals-and-braeburn-pharmaceuticals-announce) 

- PDUFA date was extended so TTNP and Braeburn can revise REMs materials and finalize the black box warnings for all opioids. (http://www.biospace.com/News/fda-needs-more-time-to-review-titan-pharma/409401)

- A gentleman on iHUB did a potential break down of stock value if approved (http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=122700654)

My position: Picked up $1200 in call options at $7.5 strike with June expiration. Going to pick-up some shares as well.

Good luck boyos.

Edit: Opioid addiction is huge in the US right now. I am a frequent NPR listener and they've done a couple of pieces on the opioid epidemic spreading across America. People are selling the pills, burning off the protective coating, and shooting up the drugs. Here is a very compelling piece on it from NPR:

If a stock goes from $5 to $6 on a regular basis, couldn't you hypothetically always make money and never lose it. Buy the stock at $5 or $5.50 and just wait for it until it goes up above what you bought it for, even if it just goes up 5 cents. Get in quickly when the stock price is even slightly down and sell it when it goes even 5 cents up. You can keep repeating that until you get a couple hundred bucks and call it a day. You're gaining small amounts but it adds up quickly. Why is this theory wrong? I apologize because i am completely oblivious and just cant understand how people lose money. ",0

&amp;nbsp;

Lets say I have a 20k expense coming up soon and I have the option to finance this at market rate interest rates. I have the 20k right now to pay off the expense in full.
&amp;nbsp;

If I take the loan, I expect to pay off this loan within 5 years. 
&amp;nbsp;

If I do this, I can max out my Roth Ira for the year and use the rest to invest in dividends/index funds to hold for long term.
&amp;nbsp;

I could also use a more conservative strategy and to max out my roth ira and only finance 5.5k, paying off the rest rest first.
&amp;nbsp;

Is this good strategy? Is there anything wrong with my thinking?

16-05-20,4k6cz6,TREE DD,"I posted earlier today in the daily moves thread that I had bought shares of this stock. /u/mokarney asked if I could share my DD on it so I decided to make a post instead of a reply. 

LendingTree (TREE)  Is an online lending exchange that connects consumers with multiple lenders, banks, and credit partners who compete for business. LendingTree is not a direct supplier of loans; it is instead a broker. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LendingTree)

There has been recent insider buying of this stock. 4 insiders have made purchases recently at $67-$68 range and 1 at $79. [2](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/tree/insider-trades)
The stock closed today at $69.50. 

The last 8 quarters show EPS increasing every quarter also Revenue has increased quarter over quarter for the last 6 quarters. [3](https://www.estimize.com/tree#chart=table)

TREE market cap it $795 000 000. Management has been buying back shares, $40 000 000 last quarter, with $56 000 000 ready to spend on repurchases going forward. ""At current levels, we continue to view our stock as an attractive investment and a prudent way to return capital to shareholders."" From the Q1 Earnings call May 7 2016 [4](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3972576-lendingtrees-tree-ceo-doug-lebda-q1-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript?page=2)

Short interest is extremely high for TREE at a staggering 47.3% of the shares float [5](http://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=TREE&amp;submit=Short+Quote) adding the very real possibility of a short squeeze. 

Tree has $0 of debt and $147 000 000 in cash.

Those are the facts (as I understand them) Now for my opinions. I think an online mortgage broker is a good business to be in going forward. We do everything online, why not get our auto and home loans online as well. With the current climate of possibly raising rates, the financial industry stands to gain by better margins. That's why financial stocks jumped yesterday on the increased likelihood of a Rate hike. Although TREE is not an actual lender, I think it will benefit from the current climate. TREE shares jumped 3% yesterday after the FOMC minutes were released.  

Do your own DD, don't trust me. If you lose some or all of your money on this stock that's your own dumb ass fault and I don't want to hear any whining. TREE has been dropping steadily, it could very well keep dropping. Or it could go to the god damn moon, who knows? 

My plan is to sell half my shares at $85-$90 per share as that is where insiders sold a few months ago. If TREE keeps dropping I will re-evaluate in a few weeks and either double down, bag hold, or fucking sell and move on. 

 
Edit. 

Sold my shares for $81 for a quick 20% gain.

Shitty analysis:

Best Buy, PVH, Express and Ulta will probably beat, but I don't know if the guidance will be bad and mess things up.
Guess and Abercrombie have really low estimates so technically they should beat, but Abercrombie probably wont. 

DSW, Tiffanys, Sears, Costco might miss. Even if Costco beats, it might be so little it could still go down. Then again URBN went up just meeting expectations. 

Dollar general and Big Lots I have no idea. I'd guess Big Lots will go up and dollar general will go down. Then again I thought Walmart was going to go down.  

Ride the hype and sell before earnings to be safe?

Does investing in a huge company like this make much sense? They aren't expanding like they were in the 70's and 80's but at the same time they are very profitable.

I guess I'm just wondering if the stock has a potential to grow if the company is already pretty solid and not expanding much any more.

16-05-21,4kdnrc,"Dr. Koreg's Predictions","Come right up and read my amazing predictions.  Currently I am 5/5 for predictions I have made and purchased, with a bunch that I was unable to trade due to capital being tied up. My predictions are based on a mixture of fundamental analysis with a big heaping of technical analysis for entry/exit points. 

If you don't trust that, I don't know what else to say other than if I'm wrong, it's nothing more than you deserve for listening to some random on the internet.  Do your own DD and see if you agree first.

Now on to the meat of this post. First I will post a handful of stocks that I feel are worthy of mentioning that will be broken into three categories. 1) Stocks that should go up, 2) Stocks going down, 3) Stocks that are hard to determine.

1) Stocks that should be going up

* Apple ($Aapl)
This one is kind of tricky.  Depending on who you talk to it's either pure doom or faggot's delight here. It's been stuck in a strong downward channel since the beginning of 2015, where it tested it's all time high three times before being rejected soundly. Currently, it is sitting under a long-term resistance (LTR) of ~98, but I'm unsure how strong of a resistance band this is going to be in the end. The trend for the near-term (1-2 months) should be it pushing up towards ~105 before taking another dive. 

Now Apple is complicated further because of the cultish way people flock to this stock, and that they have a new iPhone being released this year (rumor mill says September). Also we have a lot of upward momentum as Berkshire Hathaway purchased so we will likely push through the weak 98 resistance mentioned earlier. 

Koreg's Prediction: Buy. This has a lot going for it despite naysayers who hate Apple

* Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD)
This stock recently completed an ugly cup/handle pattern and has entered the breakout phase. This was greatly enhanced by the awesome earnings report recently where it has skyrocketed. The bad news is there is a strong LCR at 4.3. A place where it was stuck May 2013-September 2014, where it constantly retested this point and was thrown back only to drop heavily at the end of the pattern. 

AMD also has the release of some high-powered video cards, the Polaris line, coming up soon.  The company recently scheduled a live-stream event at Computex for May 31st where they're rumored to unveil what these things can do. It could also be their long awaited accelerated processing unit (APU) announcement code named Bristol Ridge.  This event could be the catalyst needed to punch up over the LCR.  The good news is, if it is possible to breakthrough, the sky is the limit for AMD. 

Koreg's Prediction: Buy, but be mindful of stop limits we may see a retracement before it moves up. Though it is likely too late to ride the hype train.  The safest bet is to wait until it breaks through the LCR and buy in.  

* General Electric ($GE)
I'm going to start saying this is the most questionable of the buys that I have. This stock is currently ending what I believe is a cup/handle pattern. Once the stock breaks the top of the cup (~31.5) we should see a continuation up. If it breaks out, it will be breaking it's 6 year high and the next LTR is not until almost 40. 

Fundamentally, this is fucking GE. If you have no idea what they do you must live under a rock.  

Koreg's Prediction: See if the chart pattern is confirmed and the stock is able to break 31.5. If this occurs then the stock should continue to move up to the next LTR of close to 40. Not only that, this is a solid stock anyway due to it's almost 4% dividend yield.

2) Stocks that will go down

* Caterpillar ($CAT)
Cat makes not only the ubiquitous yellow construction equipment you see, but also mining and oil equipment. They have been struggling a lot lately and this has been shown in their earnings lately. China has been harsh on them with the market glutted with equipment and sales have plummeted. Currently, they're stuck in a downward trend, but have paused currently at a LTS (support). If they continue downwards, which they likely will, the next support band is at ~64. 

Even though oil prices are currently going up, I do not see this effecting Cat until new rigs are being put up and more fracking sites are established, neither of which will happen until oil breaks up past 60 or so.

Koreg's Prediction: If Cat drops to 68 this is a prime short play. Cat is in a bad position, they make their equipment very well, and as soon as expansion slows no one wants to shell out the money for the newest model, when the ten year old pieces they have work perfectly well. Once expansion picks up again this is a good play. 

* American Airlines ($AAL)
“Investors have poured their money into airlines and airline manufacturers for 100 years with terrible results,” - Warren Buffett

Now with that quote out of the way, AAL is a shitheap of a company. They have been stuck in a strong downward trend since the beginning of 2015, and are testing a 2 year low. Everyone hates airline companies. TSA is a shitshow. People keep blowing up planes. All of these pressures are pushing the price down. 

Koreg's prediction: If AAL breaks under 30.5 this stock is going to go down faster than a Thai hooker. The first LTS it will encounter on its way down is at 24, but I'm unsure how strong of a support this will end up being. This chart has also confirmed a long-term head and shoulders pattern, and is staging it's breakout. Once we get past this LTS it's over. 

3) Stocks that are hard to determine

* Best Buy ($BBY)
Best Buy is the airlines of tech retail. People hate Best Buy not only for their awful stores but also because of the sketchy Geek Squad. That being said this stock may need to be moved up to the first category after looking at it. Long-term BBY has moved basically sideways for 10+ years. Which isn't saying that it hasn't moved a lot, but it isn't able to retain its highs or its lows for very long.  Since 2014 BBY has been forming a perfect symmetric triangle.  This breakout could be either way, and with earnings coming up soon it could be the catalyst needed to push it one way or the other. 

Koreg's Prediction: I can't say which way it'll go.  Wait until ER to make your play.  Or just say fuck this stock and find something that is better. 

TLDR:
* Aapl: It's going up, Apple is a cult.  It's going up. 
* AMD: It's going up, if it can break it's LTR at ~4.3, which it can because of the upcoming releases.
* GE: The sketchiest prediction here.  The chart pattern hasn't finished and could easily fail.  But it'll likely go up.
* CAT: It's going down. Their growth is hampered by their own products being able to run for a long time without needing replaced, and shrinking oil/mining/housing here and abroad (especially China).
* AAL: It's a fucking airline company. Planes have been falling out of the sky a lot more recently lately. The stock will follow suit.
* BBY: Unsure what will happen here, however I'm fairly certain it'll go down.  The chart has a symmetric triangle, and it's a shit retail company. 

That being said if you have a company you'd like for me to look at let me know.  I'll get around to some of them eventually. 

Personally once AAL and BBY make their choices I'm going to jump on them with both feet.  I feel like both should drop by 30% soon. ",26

16-05-20,4kashg,Company ($UPL) Goes Bankrupt and I Make 150% Return???,"On Friday, Apirl 29th, $UPL was valued around $0.32. They had debt and interest due by the end of the day, and the word on the street was they were on the verge of filing for BK. A month before, on March 1st, they were in the same situation. I speculated and bought a few thousand shares at $0.20, they ended up meeting their debt obligations and staying solvent, and the stock price popped to $1.50. I figured I would try my hand again, except this time, they did in fact file for bankruptcy later that day.

The stock price was around $0.31 when they filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy, and the shares got blacked out in my trading account. This week, on Monday the 16th, the equity reappeared in my account under the ticker $UPLMQ, trading around $0.50. So it was actually up 60% from its bankruptcy filing. I looked around online and couldn't find ANYTHING about this stock. I sold a few hundred shares just to test the liquidity and the trade executed immediately. Today it went up another 46% to $0.82.

because if it somehow stays at 21 for 2 weeks but then goes up to 21.5 would the price of the option go up? or would it be down because it has 2 weeks left and only moved up 50 cents",8

16-05-20,4kb11d,Strategy for investing in mortgage notes. Too good to be true?,"Someone I know went through with the following strategy (I included some numbers to help in the explanation, for illustration only): 

1. Find someone (maybe a client or coworker) having trouble paying their mortgage and would want out of their property, but can't sell. 
EX: $500k loan on a duplex, owe $425, market value $400k.

2. Buy their mortgage from the bank at a discount
EX: purchase for $360k (10% discount from MV)

3. Release them of the debt

4. Sell the property at or less than market value, but more than discounted price paid to bank for the mortgage.
EX: profitable for Sales price &gt; $360k 

It seems like the strategy would work, but is it so situational that it would be difficult to replicate as a regular strategy? Anything I'm missing? or Has someone tried/witnessed a similar strategy? I am a firm believer in ""if it's too good to be true, it probably is"", but maybe I'm wrong this time.",1
16-05-21,4kdz40,New to swing trading. Critiques on my strategy would be greatly appreciated.,"I use the Finviz screener. Below is the URL to my preset.

Thought process:
Positive Long Term Trend - SMA50 above SMA200 and price over SMA200

Negative Short term Trend - price below SMA20

Oversold - RSI below 50

liquidity - average volume &gt; 500K

Price between $5 - $20. 

After that I sort the stocks by Ascending RSI.
Then I take a look at some of the first stocks listed and check out the chart on Yahoo Finance.

I then use MFI as a volume based indicator making sure there are oversold signals (MFI &lt; 30).

I also use the stochastic %D line and make sure it is &lt; 20.

Buy when MACD starts moving from a negative direction to a positive Direction.

Set stop loss = closing price - (2 * ATR)

Sell when MFI is &gt; 70, Stochastic %D &gt; 80 and MACD switches from positive direction to a negative direction.

Thanks!

I'm still having problems getting a tier 2 level.. so I made a cash secured put on kinda a random company whose news, price, and chart I liked the look of. The company stock ticker is TROV It closed at $4.93 today. It was bouncing around between $4.6 at lowest and $5.01 at highest today. I did the trade at around the $4.8-$4.95 range.

The cash secured put was 3 contracts at the strike price of $10 for a premium of $5.2 for Jun 17th. So I got a total of $1560 in advance.

Now I believe at any time I can exercise it at the price of $10 per share(-$3000) or close it by buying the inverse. Then just sell all the shares for the current stock price of $4.93. For $1479. Adding that to the $1560 premium price paid. So I made $39 today.

I'm not looking to really hold it for the whole 30 days..But I figured I just found a way to day trade using Options in a tier lvl 1 account, with low cash requirements. Seems pretty promising to me.  Just need to sell in the money put options for the premium bonus. Was thinking of trying to do a spread using cash secured puts and covered calls. But I'm not too sure it's possible..

My situation is the following. I am 23, working in central Europe as an IT Engineering 
with 120 000 euro/year wage, working for the same company for 1 year already. I am
originally from Eastern Europe where I managed to buy a house this month, for 80 000
euro. From now forward, I started saving money.

My monthly costs including rent, taxes, food, travels, etc are less than 3000 euro, but let's
keep this amount. I save around 7000 euro/month.

Where should I invest in order to gain financial independency? I started to read about stocks
investments, but I'm very beginner. The bank where I keep my money suggested me some
Mutual investing funds (nnip.com) where other people buys and manage stocks in your behalf.
What are your experiences using those funds? Do you recommend?

One of my thoughts were to buy real estates in my country for around 50k-60k euro and rent 
them for 250-300 euro / month. How this investment sounds for you?

I appreciate any advice. 

Thank you

16-05-23,4kmnmk,Making sense of it all (Stock and account tracker advice request),"Here's the skinny:

I've been getting more involved in finances.  I've got the Acorns account doing its thing, and have a few stocks now with Robinhood.  The difficult part is my 401k retirement portfolio, which currently consists of 29 various Vanguard accounts and a few others.  Pretty diverse.  Two of these accounts are money market accounts.  I'm pretty hands-off for the most part with the portfolio.  Money comes in, there's a 2% match from my company (50% up to 4% emp contribution), and I'm contributing 4% pretax, 8% Roth to the portfolio.  

As I said, I'm ""pretty"" hands-off.  The exception is the money market accounts.  I treat them like a temporary holding, with the idea being that I can move the money from there to a different one of the many other funds if I feel like it (aka notice a dip in share price, etc.).  

Unfortunately, my company uses Paychex Flex/Paychex MyApps to manage this, and nothing seems to be able to link up to it to get realtime account info, so when I tried to use FutureAdvisor, I had to manually punch in all the individual stocks and their current values, and it shows the growth only from that point in time, with no updates for the past several months because it can't ""see in"" for newer contributions.  Additionally, I can't update the number of shares, only delete a stock and add it back.  It isn't capable of tracking performance over time.  What's the point??

I'm still new to all this, and have added my Robinhood stocks to Google, but it doesn't seem to track the individual stock performance, just the portfolio as a whole.

What I'm looking for is an online service, or at the very least a desktop app, which I can add all of my retirement stock symbols, and see them all laid out either absolutely or relatively.  I'd like to be able to see - at a glance - which are performing well and which are dipping.  It would be great if I could edit my shares to actually track my portfolio, but maybe I'm asking too much.  

I did some searching, both here and elsewhere, and StockMarketEye seems like a potential candidate.  

Looking for feedback/input from the community.  Thanks!",1

16-05-22,4kit35,Beating the market and CAPM,"I'm pretty new to investing so hopefully this question isn't too simple.

I've heard that it's very hard (some might say impossible) to ""beat the market"" and because of that, as I'm a pretty risk-averse investor, my investing ""strategy"" has been to just dump the large majority of my money in an S&amp;P 500 index fund and forget about it.  (I rarely sell).

Recently, I've been learning about the Capital Asset Pricing Model and now I'm wondering what ""beating the market"" means and why it's difficult.

For example, it's clear that if I had dumped all my money into AAPL, I'd be doing much better right now.  Obviously, though, it's a much higher risk investment and there's a not insignificant chance I would have lost all my money.  Using CAPM, I figure that if I had held a portfolio of approximately 50% AAPL, 50% risk-free asset (e.g. Treasury notes), my ""risk"" under the CAPM definition would be about the same but my returns would still have been significantly higher than the S&amp;P 500 index fund.  Presumably, I'd be selling and buying Treasuries on the way up to maintain this (de)leverage ratio.  (This was calculated with returns over the last 10 years).

So what's going on here?  I don't feel like it would have taken a very shiny crystal ball to see that AAPL might be on its way up even 10 years ago but, for sure, hindsight is 20/20 and the past is no predictor of the future.

I can think of a few explanations but I'm not sure:

1. My calculations are wrong.
2. ""Risk"" is broader than CAPM standard deviation of returns.  (In which case, what else needs to go into a proper risk model?)
3. 10 years is not long enough.  Over a long enough time frame, the market always wins.  In another 10 years we may look back 20 years and AAPL won't look as good compared to the whole market.  I can certainly believe that but if those are the time frames we're talking about, it seems like there's a decent chance to stay ahead.  

(BTW, I'm not asking about AAPL in particular.  It is just being used as an example and because it's well-known).",4

16-05-23,4kmt3f,Vietnam Arms Embargo Lifted By The U.S,"Vietnam is currently stuck with tons of outdated Russian arms/equipment from the 60's, 70's, and 80's. Requests for small arms (and equipment), military (all branches) vehicles, and military technology will likely be up for grabs in terms of fulfillment through penteg arms contracts. This boom isn't going to solely produced by Vietnam though, this is just a sign of what's to come.

""Is it priced it yet?""

No I don't believe it is, because the amount of arms contracts/demand for contractors/brokers have been heavily rising for about 2 years and some change, and is a overall reflection of the world and not a prediction of what's happened today. The amount of demand for arms has been gradually (not nearly as fast) rising for awhile beyond that 2 1/2 year point as well. While some have seen this coming, I do not believe that the majority of investors/firms have seen it unless they have a passion for this kind of thing and or have been luck.

""Okay I'm excited about this, but what's the catalyst besides Vietnam being allowed to possibly buy gear and weapons.""

The South China Sea. As much as the our and veitnam's president's didn't want to admit it tonight, that's what this is about. This was a lot more obvious than the dramatic increase for arms (even though they're directly related, arms contracts are a lot more boring than they sound and consequently they're overlooked for more attractive industry's touting tremendous amounts of growth in short periods of time). I doubt Vietnam is going to be the only one with a increase in the demand for arms, equipment, and technology so the boom should make people healthy amounts of profit for years to come.

The common firms who actively bid on penteg arms contracts as well as other contracts should be good bets. I'm pointing out a trend, not specific companies because there are so many out there.

But I have a few tax related questions. Here are some scenarios that I'd like some guidance on.

Scenario 1. You buy a single share of a company for $30. After an arbitrary amount of time, you sell it when it hits $50. You only get taxed on the difference correct? The $20 gain. Does the amount of time you waited between buying and selling affect the tax rate?


Scenario 2. You buy a single share of a company for $30. After an arbitrary amount of time, you sell it when it hits $10. Can you write off the $20 loss on your taxes?


Scenario 3. You buy a single share of a stock for $30. After an arbitrary amount of time, you decide you want to trade it to someone else for a stock worth the same amount. Do you pay taxes on trades?

Scenario 4. Let's say a family member or friend asked me to invest something on their behalf. Like $500. After sometime I sell it and give back all the amount they gave and what they earned. I essentially did it for free for them. I don't have to pay taxes on that do I? It's up to them to pay the taxes on the amount gained right?",0

I've just opened a Help to Buy ISA with Santander. It's an AER variable account that pays annually. As I understand it, I have to wait until the end of the tax year until I receive my interest payment from Santander.

Other banks offer monthly interest payments, and I'm thinking it would be worth shopping around once in a while (it's free to transfer money from one bank to another). 

Is anyone else here doing this? Provided Santander stay within 2.5-4.0% AER for the year I feel like I'm best sticking with them for the year. If not, I think should probably have gone with a pay monthly and transferred as soon as the rates changed.",1

They are priced very high right now and we have a choice of selling them now, paying taxes and reducing the mortgage or just continuing to hold them so the tax liability drops and hoping they continue to rise...

16-05-23,4ko1j3,Skepticism about the ROI of equity crowdfunding,"With the legislation of JOBS Act I’ve seen a lot of debates about the future of equity crowdfunding. There were both an unjustified optimism and excessive pessimism. Yet I think the most important question to be answered this topic is - do we even need it? Think about it: max amount of money you are allowed to raise this way in a year is $1M (with modern startups raising average $2-4M); limits are placed on investors based on some conditions; issuing companies are required to make quite a few public (sic!) disclosures and also have some on-going reporting requirements; lack of markets for investors to sell their shares on.

Seeing how all those requirements will inevitably put significant burdens both on investors and entrepreneurs, it feels like such an option for crowdfundig would only be taken into consideration by those that could not get funding from traditional channels like startup accelerators, angel investors, etc. - which most likely means they’re not good enough/too risky for professional investors.

The reason Im so surprised is my largest position (&gt;40%) is AAPL and my cost basis is like $112. Yea I know. That's on top of another huge position of mine in AAPL that lost big --I sold just before its rebound in 2013ish.

Another thing, is Id be a lot better off I had never sold a single share. For one, I had a GOOGL cost basis in the mid $600's presplit. (That's low $300's post-split for the layperson.) I had WFC shares in the low 30's. MCD's shares in the mid 80's. And of course all those hundreds of AAPL shares at about $78 on a split adjusted basis. 

So in other words, I am not a prolific man. But it is gratifying to know, that every stock I've bought...with the except of UNP...has turned into a huge winner. Even if I later sold them prematurely. 

So that tells me to be more confident in the stocks I own. 

And just so no one accuses me of cherry picking, here's my entire portfolio:

Ticker and Cost Basis

GOOGL (closed)

AAPL 112

BRK.B high 130's

DIS low 60's

MCD (closed)

UNP (closed)

WFC high 40's

Now the real issue, is that I'm doing this instead of taking that CFA lvl 1 Mock and heading to the gym.

Edit: Not sure where all the negativity is coming from, except for ya know, this being the internet and all. My post isnt cock-waggling. I was pleasantly surprised to actually be **up** on the market after years of thinking I was losing to it. I'm not opening up a hedge fund with this track record, jesus guys. Lighten up.

In addition to the possibility of winning lawsuit monies this year, I figured that all the elements were in place for a nice turnaround of the companies financials. No update on the lawsuit [thus far] (https://libpatent.com/pc/20719), but the financials did [turn around as expected] (https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3AREFR&amp;fstype=ii&amp;ei=CzZDV_nJBJrKsQH13LHoDw).

So it seems pretty strange that this fucker's SP has decreased ~15% points during this time period. Looking at the [short data] (http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-November.html) only makes the situation creepier. Last week's total volume adds up to **44,286** shares traded, fully **22,469** of which were sold short. Note, that average *daily* volume fluctuates between **15-35K**, suggesting that with last *week's* 52-week low prices, there were very few owners willing to sell at those prices. The real kicker is that as of 4/29/2016 shorts had already borrowed ~1M shares, already requiring between 30-60 days for [them to cover] (http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/refr/short-interest). 

Now usually there is nothing I like more than to catch shorts with their pants down, but this situation is giving me the heebie jeebies. I can't image all these fuckers piling on short without some compelling info, but I can't find shit. So here I am, writing this shit out for you plebs in the faint hope that someone can point me in an interesting direction. ",22

McAfee himself has taken to Twitter to promote the company and promised announcements in the coming weeks but didn't respond to requests for comment.

The stock's popularity is having a knock-on effect for Castle Rock, Colo. in-vitro diagnostics company Venaxis (APPY) , which closed 9.4% higher Thursday at $3.97 after current MGT CEO Robert Ladd disclosed a 5% holding in the company. It hit a 52-week high of $6.65 Wednesday, the day of the announcement and the same day MGT hit its own 52-week high.

I understand their reasoning- basically you're 'showing your cards' to your broker and directly telling them that you want to sell stock X when it declines 15% or whatever from its relative peak. 

This advice implies that armed with this knowledge, your broker can influence a stocks price to dip that extra 3%, for example, thereby triggering your stop, before the 'true' price bounces back up. The potential pitfall being that you're out of that position when you didn't want to be because of a temporary price swing influenced by your own declarations.  

My question is, is this type of price manipulation a realistic expectation for small positions ($500-$2000).  Would a large broker actually sell enough stock in order to deflate a price because they know they can rebuy and net an extra 15 shares from Joe The Plumber? My guess is that this does happen but only when there are enough Joes with those automatic stops to make it worthwhile.

To me, the benefit of an emotionless trailing stop is quite helpful and I don't want the extra hassle of setting up and paying for a third party service like TradeStops that essentially makes you do all the work still. But I could be wrong...",2

- Red is one of everyone's favorite low-fee ETFs.  
- Blue is class A mutual fund from another major firm.  

My questions:  
1. Red is clearly out-performing blue, right?  
2. Is it possible the difference between the two slopes is due to dividend payments?  
3. I got charged almost 6% in fees to roll over into blue (didn't realize it until AFTER it rolled) and the yearly fees are about 1%. Should I feel fleeced? Company advisor ensured that the fees pay for the superior service of an actively managed MF, but my reading of the performance, leads me to believe I am actually paying for them to do worse. I must be missing something here, right?

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BvapZ9DF8oVKuyg0MeDA4nPS1iA7Ncm7pHwWDYgYIG8/edit#gid=911100531

Recap:

One of the flattest days I've ever seen. My guess is it is because of no Canadian volume. Either way, the 1 min was pretty crazy, with some huge spikes and drops, nearly untradable. 

From a technical standpoint, SPX did not even hit or test 2057 (~205.9), which was a key level on Friday. This is good news for bears. Also, the last few minutes showed good strength from the bears. It's crucial to break the 2048-2050 channel, but closing on it is still good progress. I'm still sticking with my gut that we will hit 2020s this week. Tomorrow is new home sales, not a very big catalyst. Wednesday and onward will have macroeconomic catalysts for spx futures. 

From a 1 d perspective, SPX is making a great lower highs pattern, where the lower high of this cycle is the 2055-2060 area. For this trend to continue, it's important that SPX does not re-test the 2057 area over and over again over this week. 

I talked about NFLX in the google sheets. NFLX is a fucking money making machine if you watch its action in pre-market. I've generally noticed that when NFLX opens up,  it rallies hard as fuck and when it opens down, it dies. Keep in mind, there are exceptions to this ""phenomenon"". However, I made good money on it (could have actually made more than 35% had I stuck in, around 70%). 

Overall a decent day, couldn't make much trades and a lot of pussiness and stopping out on my end. Holding all the puts I had, I'd have made a lot. But the name of the game is capital preservation and risk management, cannot forget that.",49

16-05-23,4kq0in,Super Deep NFLX DD,"Netflix just announced they have a deal with Disney, Marvel, LucasFilms,and Pixar to be the sole home for these movies with regards to US pay TV. Why is this a huge deal? One, it really isnt anything that will make the balance sheet pop right away, will actually lower gross profit as im assuming this deal cost an Netlifx ass load of cash. But what makes Netflix stock price pop? One - meaningless new articles that are favorable for netflix. Check. Two - Subscriber growth, this move will actually help their US numbers grow. Not substantially but 100% noticeable to investors who seem to only care about the subscriber growth numbers. The NUMBER 1 thing investors care about is US sub growth. And this move will bump that number for the few years to come, which is huge in convincing investors to stay on board while Netflix works on it international sub growth by creating localized content. We will see small gains on the stock all week. Ending up around $100 at a minimum. I don't know why you would need to know anything else. The big gains are going to come end of the year. If this stock continues to get pummeled after this weeks gains, I would be looking to buy in at anything under or around $90. Netflix has invested so much money into content this year, everyone is going to be blown away by how much content netflix is actually releasing this year and the effect that will have on subs is going to large. *edit - yes the agreement was made back in 2012, but this prior to Lucas films acquisition and and now that it is coming it is bringing up HYPE for new content now. Doesnt matter that this agreement was reached long ago. ",5

The fund is not doing so well and so my position was cut in addition to half of the front office staff due to poor performance.

I have a track record for the last 17 months of performance from a personal trading account and am extremely interested in starting my own fund. Would anybody have any advice on what I should do? I am looking to raise money from friends and family to start my fund, would anybody have any advice on if this is possible from a legal perspective and any other advice on just raising capital in general? I consulted a law firm and they wanted to charge me about 40k just to draw up the documents incorporate the entity.

(Maybe I am naive and have not utilized the infrastructure properly but personally I do not see any advantage from a trading perspective being at a bulge bracket bank or hedge fund. I think trading is a singular endeavor and there are too many distractions that hinder you from growing to the type of trade you intend to be.)

I am a young shmuck who is going to become the next Paul Tudor Jones. I am confident in my abilities and I know the odds are stacked against me but this is my passion and I am following it.

16-05-23,4kqmjt,The absurdly-hopeful XGTI army contract thread.,"Just for fun I'm compiling all of the hopeful information I have about what XG Tech does, what their recent acquisition of IMT means, and what the army contract seems to be all about.

A. XG's product is a mobile communications infrastructure, and alternative option for rural telecom. Their main product is the Xmax system: http://www.xgtechnology.com/products/xmax-transportable-broadband-wireless-system/

The Xmax system claims to offer deployment flexibility and immediate connectivity. Here are the bullet points:

Pre-packaged mobile wireless broadband system which can extend the range of data communications up to seven miles (160 square miles of coverage) around a mobile command center deliver real-time situational awareness
Rapid deployment feature allows setup within 30 minutes
Interoperability capabilities that allow seamless communications among land mobile radios, cell phones, military and public safety P25 networks
Satellite and microwave backhaul communication links that work in any disaster or catastrophic failure environment
Modular design that allows self-organizing xG networks to communicate without human intervention
Fully configured components all enclosed in rugged, easily transportable packaging

B. The reasons for acquiring IMT:

Complementary market focus; IMT has a core customer roster that includes federal, state, local government, public safety, and Department of Defense agencies. These markets have unmet broadband communications needs that can be solved by the xMax secure private mobile broadband solution.
IMT also has a strong presence in event management communications, which is an area of focus for xG. To that end, xG announced in September of last year the availability of the rapidly-deployable xMax Transportable Broadband system, which enables instant, uninterrupted communications during events, disasters and other quickly changing operating environments.
Closely-aligned product development roadmaps, with the potential for joint development of a point-to-multipoint product for video that would allow multiple cameras to share and receive information.
xG gains the benefit of leveraging IMT’s ISO 9001:2008 QMS approach into its own quality processes.
IMT has proven miniaturization technology, and is a world leader in the design of their transmitters. Their key enabling technology in this area is ultra-compact COFDM (Coded Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing), which will benefit greatly from xG’s patented interference mitigation technology, which has been proven in demanding Department of Defense test environments.
Once the acquisition is finalized, the utilization of assets are expected to realize cost savings of up to $2MM annually, due to efficiencies realizable from shared facilities, tools, processes, and especially product manufacturing, which IMT does in-house and xG currently outsources. The operations of both companies will continue to be housed in their respective locations.
The acquisition of IMT’s assets is not expected to increase xG’s cash burn rate; and rather, should reduce it.

C. The army contract: So far as I can tell, they will be providing the army with the xmax communications infrastructure. I tried getting ahold of XG about pricing a basic Xmax unit, but haven't heard back. Still, for any great distance you're talking about a lot of moving parts they'll be purchasing. I also think it has a lot to do with this vehicular WAP XG has: http://www.xgtechnology.com/products/xvm-vehicle-modem/

The CN3100 provides QoS (quality of service) while supporting calling, texting and data streams over the xMax network. It includes a WiFi router chip that allows it to simultaneously support multiple external devices wirelessly. It enables operators to deploy wide area xMax networks that can smoothly integrate with the large installed base of WiFi and Ethernet-capable wireless devices. By incorporating high-power xMax radios, the CN3100 can provide range and reliability required by today’s mobile applicationss.

---

I was also checking out IMT's site, and if I'm reading this right - they have a lot of the same type of WAP options for aircraft? Honestly, I think XG is moving in some really exciting directions. If I don't jump out of a 3rd story window as a result of these dips, it might well make me rich. Eventually. ",13

And raising rates is a way for the FOMC to slow down lending (and spending as a result) if I did my homework in macro-econ correctly, which slows down the economy and will realistically push us into our next bear cycle.

Prosecutors say they were acting on a complaint from France’s tax authority, which has for years been locked in a battle with Google, demanding back taxes and fines of more than 1 billion euros ($1.12 billion), according to people familiar with the matter.

23 y/o Software Engineer. Posted this in the daily and didn't luck out.  I read Boglehead's Guide to Investing as a primer and loved it, and I was about to move my Roth IRA/additional investments to Vanguard since usually their expense ratios are hailed as being the lowest.


My question is: Is that still true before you qualify for the Admiral class funds? Those 0.6% and 0.8% ER's look sexy as hell, don't get me wrong, but my Roth only has 11k and it seems foolish to move without the funds to diversify over a few different index funds/bond funds. The bogleheads wiki ""Three Fund Portfolio"" suggested funds VTSMX, VGTSX, and VBMFX had at best 0.16% expense ratios. My current funds on Fidelity (FUSEX, FSEMX, FBIDX) are 0.1% except for FBIDX, and with only $2,500 minimums. Am I missing some super low expense ratio index funds with lower minimum investments? Just making sure it makes sense to stay with Fidelity for now.

Do most of you have margin accounts for the rapid trades I see on here (I'm pretty sure I'd get penalized pretty harshly by Fidelity if I tried the turn around I sometimes see here)?

16-05-25,4kx4ak,(AUS) Need advice for (potential) upcoming global economic crash.,"I do not want this to devolve into a debate about whether or not a crash is coming. For the sake of this thread, let's assume it will be happening later this year.

I'm in Australia, and my assets are;

* 270k USD 
* 1m cash split among the big 4 Australian banks
* 350k house in queensland
* 300k diversified portfolio
* 250k gold/silver
* 150k cryptocurrencies

I don't feel comfortable holding so much cash, and would love some advice on how i can be in a better position for a major crash.

EDIT: My concern is that the banks will take my money during a 'bail in', and that the government guarantee of $250,000 per bank will not actually be paid out. The government will only provide 20 billion to each bank for this guarantee, which seems to be way too low.",1
16-05-24,4kueu6,Opinions on Tradier?,"What do you guys think of [Tradier](https://tradier.com)? It looks like a nice, low cost brokerage, with shorting and options, and it allows you to interface it with a number of analytical platforms. However, I tend to find that I usually get what I pay for. Low cost and free brokers are great, from a monetary standpoint, but they're not always the best in terms of reliability and support.

I rely on [Technician](https://technicianapp.com) for my charts and really love the platform overall. The main reason why I'm looking at Tradier is that it can be used to trade directly from Technician. This would be extremely convenient for me and I would love to not deal with $10 fees. But, as I said, I'm concerned about reliability. I'm looking to start with a small $1,500 cash account, gradually bring in another ~$15,000 over the course of two months or so, and then deposit $500-1,000/mo into that account - depending on the path my career takes me on in the next 6 months, that number may increase to $1,000-$2,000/mo. While this isn't an enormous fortune, I'd be pretty bummed, to say the least, if the server that managed my money went down for any amount of time.

I know that Interactive Brokers is, in many ways, an excellent option for me, once I have the minimum capital available. But Tradier is still more cost effective. Similarly, the quality, versatility, and ease of use of Technician as an analytical platform makes me reluctant to work on anything else.

Footlocker had 7.6b in revenue last year... Even if all of those sales were wiped out, that would only cost Nike about 3.5bn of approximately 21b annual revenue. But we all know that is not what is happening. Footlocker's revenue misses are likely due to the death of the mall trend. Nike, per everything I have seen, actually does very well in online sales and likely has better margins than going through a retailer.

16-05-25,4l2guy,Array Biopharma DD - Last call for the $ARRY train,"Array Biopharma (ARRY) is unique among pre-commercial bios in that while most companies of their sort are focusing on developing 1 drug at a time, they are developing a wide array (hence the name) of pharmaceuticals in an incredibly deep pipeline.  Currently they have over a dozen trials in progress.  2016 will be a pivotal year for them because 3 of their drug candidates are expected to read out phase 3 data in the upcoming quarter.

**Some basic facts about ARRY**

Current price: $3.36

Shares outstanding: 143.44m

Market cap: $491.96m

Cash position (12/31/15): $185.4m

Institutional ownership: 92%

**Business Model**

As I mentioned previously, Array has a very deep pipeline with over a dozen trials in progress.  This would normally impossible for a pre-commercial bio, but Array has spread its drug portfolio by aggressively seeking out partnerships.  While this means that they will not be able to reap the full rewards of their drugs when they are commercialized, they do get cash up front and milestone payments to generate stable cash flow for their R&amp;D.  This minimizes the risk of dilution, as cash will not be a problem barring catastrophic failure across multiple lines simultaneously.  Their portfolio includes both fully-owned and partnered developments.

Wholly owned:

- Binimetinib (p3, cancer)
- Encorafenib (p3, cancer)
- ARRY-797 (p2, LMNA-dilated DCM)
- ARRY-382 (p1, cancer)

Partnered:

**Value Drivers/Catalysts in 2016**

Now that's out of the way, let's just consider the value drivers in the near term. Dates are according to ARRY's latest corporate presentation.  Please do note that all of these trials are in the second-line treatment space, where there is less money but a pressing medical need.  As we know, cancer victims who recur have absolutely dismal prognoses, and there's often no standard treatment.  Second-line also has regulatory benefits in that studies can be defined with their primary endpoint being DFS (disease-free survival) or PFS (progression-free survival) instead of OS (overall survival).

- Binimetinib (Regulatory submission for NRAS melanoma in June)
- Binimetinib+Encorafenib (Data from trial in BRAF melanoma in late Q2 or early Q3, FDA submission soon to follow)
- Selumetinib (Data from trial in NSCLC in Q3)

First up is binimetinib, which will report full data from the NEMO trial at ASCO.  Initial results were out in December of last year, reporting a PFS increase from 1.5 months to 2.8 months.  Statistically significant, but the ASCO abstract recently released shows more wrinkles to this data.

Abstract here: http://abstracts.asco.org/176/AbstView_176_166136.html

In stratifying the data, they found that binimetinib treatment following prior immunotherapy  increased baseline PFS from 1.5 to 5.5 months.  Immunotherapy has emerged as the first line treatment of choice in melanomas, but these results demonstrate how binimetinib synergizes into the current treatment protocol.  An NDA will be submitted to FDA in June.  There is currently no approved second line targeted therapy for NRAS melanoma.

Expect similar results to occur in their other melanoma study with the binimetinib and encorafenib combo, whose results will be out this summer.  Binimetinib and encorafenib not only been demonstrated to synergize with first-line immunotherapy, but they offer a vastly improved safety profile over other MEK/BRAF inhibitors already in use.  While Array does not expect to conquer this billion-dollar market overnight, they feel that they can take an appreciable slice of it given improved efficacy and safety.  One of the main selling points they point to is the lack of photosensitivity, which half the patients taking cobimetinib+vemurafenib suffer.  Encorafenib is also being studied in BRAF colorectal cancer.

Selumetinib is primarily owned by AstraZeneca, which is a drug that is being developed for multiple indications.  The phase 3 results for non-small cell lung cancer are expected to read out in Q3, and other trials for thyroid cancer (orphan drug status granted on 5/12) and neurofibromatosis (in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute) are being enrolled.  Astra projects peak sales of selumetinib well over $1b, of which Array will receive royalties in the ""double digits.""

**Bottom Line**

Array might not be working with the most exciting and radical approaches, but their careful, diversified, and risk-mitigated approach offers them multiple shots on goal between now and the end of the year.  Optimistically, we can expect annual sales several hundred million in combined sales/royalties from binimetinib, encorafenib, and selumetinib after approval, which, given price:sales valuation in the bio industry (average is around 6:1) would easily put their market cap in the $1-2b range.  I am in this trade for the long haul and, assuming everything goes according to plan, expect to hold onto a core position until I see at least $10 pps.",50

( LC) that invests in the company's online consumer loans suffered one of its worst monthly performances for April and disclosed it was buying riskier loans than originally intended, according to letters reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.*

*The performance -- a return of 0.12% -- was the second-smallest monthly gain in the fund's five-year history. The portfolio, called Broad Based Consumer Credit Q Fund, has $825 million in assets under management and is run by LendingClub ( LC ) unit LC Advisors. This January, the fund, had its smallest monthly gain, 0.1%, far short of its average monthly performance of about 0.6%.*

*The slip in returns highlights one of the many challenges LendingClub ( LC ) faces as its seeks to restore confidence following the forced resignation of its chief executive, Renaud Laplanche. Mr. Laplanche, who also started the company, agreed to leave after its board found LendingClub ( LC ) employees had falsified data on some loans sold to an investment bank.*

16-05-24,4kvd33,Leveraged ETF still a bad idea?,"This has been covered on a previous topic but thread closed.

I still have not heard a ""good"" argument against leveraged etfs. Particularly for s&amp;p indexed 3x.

I own spxl so would like to use that as an example:
Cons:
-expense ratio ~1%
-leverage decay
-theoretical large loss (what happens if market goes down 34% in one day???)

Pros:
-high gain potential

Assumption:
-the market always is positive in any 15 year period

Question:
If, and I guess it's a big if, the market is always going to be positive, wouldn't holding spxl long term be the best possible bet? The exact opposite of what is recommended?

Example 1 ""bullish"":
Over a 20 year period, the market goes up 150% (irrespective of inflation). Spxl will go up something like 400%? Should be like 450 but taking some arbitrary amount off for decay and expense.

Example 2 ""bearish"":
Over a 20 year period, the market goes up 30% (irrespective of inflation). Spxl will go up something like 75%? Should be like 90 but taking some arbitrary amount off for decay and expense.

I guess my question is, doors decay matter THAT much to negate the almost guaranteed gains?",23

U.S. Total Market Index ETF (VUN) 0.16% MER

Both are bought in CAD and not hedged.

Despite the low Canadian dollar right now im still leaning towards non-hedged although im a bit hesitant.

They have bought St Judes a Biomedical Devices company, which caused a dip in their prices last month, but I love that purchase. Our aging population is going to be a huge factor for biomed devices.

All in all, you like the tickers on the list, but there's just too many.  

What's a particular fundamental data point, or technical characteristic that you might use to thin the herd?  One or two particular things to set a handful of stocks apart from the rest.  Or attempt to anyway.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BvapZ9DF8oVKuyg0MeDA4nPS1iA7Ncm7pHwWDYgYIG8/edit#gid=933890929

(I am holding those puts overnight. Usually I NEVER will do that, but I turned them into a pseudospread by selling some puts).

Recap:

From a record flat day to a massive rally... what a series of events. I can't lie and say this rally didn't knock me off my feet, but I'll thank my past self for grabbing vix and vxx puts as a hedge. I ended up covering short legs for my near DTE spreads, and added more spreads today and sold a few call spreads as well. Also ended up buying some ratio spreads to hedge myself. It was interesting to watch SPX battle the 2074-2076 channel, where it was stuck for a few hrs. It ended up breaking and getting denied at 2080, and now back to the 2076 level. After today's activity, there is a gap to fill at 2048 (also one at 2040, if I believe from a few days ago). 

Lots of catalysts tomorrow to watch out for:

Netflix was a money maker today. I'm pretty disappointing that I did not hold my calls (sold in less than 5 minutes), when I had a gut feeling it was going to explode today and it did. I did make good profit on it twice, 16 and 31% and I know some people here made over 50%. I have yet to go back and actually analyze how often NFLX rallies when opening up, and how often NFLX dies when opening down. I'd also have to factor in nasdaq futures into the hypothesis.

I will be watching NFLX again tomorrow morning; my obvious guess is one of these days NFLX will be red (profit taking + overbought). Hoping we can all make bank off netflix in the first hr of market open.

It's definitely very important to be hedged and to play BOTH sides. Don't be an idiot like me and be biased to the short side. Good job bulls, you guys feasted today. Bears, hang in tight. It's gonna be a long night lol...

16-05-26,4l3sgv,"S&amp;P 500 target: 2,200 by end of June. 2,350 by end of year.","Note: we will **reach** these amounts in the time in between. No guarantee we stay there, i.e. we could hit 2,350 in October and end the year at 2,200

The S&amp;P500 is going up, whether the stock manipulators want it or not. After trying everything to crash it (and then some), it is overwhelmingly clear right now that the S&amp;P500 is headed for new highs. Why? Simple: **because every reason it crashed in the first place was bullshit.**

For a year now, stock manipulators have been trying to force tyro investors to liquidate their positions. ""The next big crisis is upon us! Greece/China/Venezuela/Energy/Student loans are going to cause the next great crisis! Oh noes!"" they repeated everywhere they could.

Of course, anyone with any kind of formation in finance knew it was all bullshit. The economy is doing well, very well in fact, and the fact remains that stocks are massively underpriced. I would go as far as saying they are 15% underpriced right now when you compare to historical data.

Right now, the S&amp;P500 offers a niggardly yield of [2.10%](http://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-dividend-yield/), but this doesn'T tell the whole story: for years now, companies have been buying back shares instead of increasing dividends simply because their stocks are too cheap. They could easily stop their buybacks and kick the dividend up 50% overnight if they wanted to. Companies have so much cash they don't know what to do with it at this point. Look: [http://www.factset.com/websitefiles/PDFs/cashinvestment/cashinvestment_3.21.16](http://www.factset.com/websitefiles/PDFs/cashinvestment/cashinvestment_3.21.16)

Companies have double the cash on hand they had at the end of the financial crisis. Ever wonder why? Here's the hint: because companies are earning tons of money. In the case of Apple for instance, it could basically buy itself out at today's (ridiculously low) levels.

For a year, the stock market did nothing at all. It stagnated, went down a little, went back up, then stagnated again. Every time, some dumbass somewhere invented a reason to crash it. ""Oh no China debt/blah blah blah"" This time, however, I believe they ran out of steam. People are starting to be fed up with the lies market manipulators spout and nothing seems to be in the way.

There is no major crisis coming our way. There never was. It was all made-up lies and palaver. Only idiots sold when the market (briefly) went down due to manipulation.

I believe we will hit new market highs very soon. It is long overdue. I believe we will return to a 8-10% S&amp;P500 return per year immediately. For your information, the S&amp;P began the year at 2,043. This means a 2,210 is EASILY achievable even if nothing improves - however, the economy is quickly improving anyway.

There we go, the ultimate truth. Manipulators tried everything but ultimately, as always, failed. The market is critically undervalued and we are due for a big bounce up. The only thing holding it back atm is a strong US dollar, but that's not going to be enough since a large part of the US' economy is domestic.

16-05-24,4kw90g,"Invest in the Market, Pay Off Loans, or Save for Mortgage?","I recently finished my undergrad degree and am currently in a one-year graduate program. My parents agreed to pay my undergrad tuition (can't thank them enough for that) and are paying my rent while I'm in grad school, so my expenses are pretty minimal. I have saved approximately $10,000 from jobs and graduation and am trying to decide what to do with it. Currently $6,500 of it is sitting in my savings account earning me a cool .8% APY. I have approximately $3,500 in a TD Ameritrade account and would like to add more while I still have free trades for about another month. I have 3 positions I want to add to and 3 new positions I want to open. 

I guess I am trying to find the right balance, but I know there isn't much of a point in holding positions under $1,000 most of the time with trade fees, but I will be graduating in a year with about $6,000 in student loan debt @ 3.75%. I have a graduate assistantship that waives my tuition costs and pays me approximately $800/mo, but those tricky ""other"" fees will add up to about $6,000. I went ahead and accepted a $10,000 student loan since I have 6 months to pay it back interest-free. Running the math, I usually have expenses of about $400-500/mo so I could add around $4000 to my savings by the end of the year. At the end of the year I will be moving to a metropolitan area where I have accepted a job in 2017. I will likely be either looking to rent, buy and occupy the home, or buy and rent the home. The housing market is pretty decent in the area, but I don't have any expertise in housing. 

My prevailing options with the money are as followings:
1. Pay off student loans as they become due to avoid interest
2. Dump some or all of my money into my TD account
3. Keep the money for a down payment on a home
4. Some blend of paying off the loans and using the rest for my portfolio or mortgage down payment.

With the options where I don't pay the loan, I would anticipate paying off the loan pretty quickly after starting work. I will be making $50,000/yr, so I would probably be able to knock out the loans within 12 months. All advice is appreciated!",1

16-05-24,4kwe5z,Looking for Feedback / Criticism of this Thought Process (RAD),"I want to cut my teeth on options and think Rite Aid could be a good opportunity to not only learn but possibly make some money. I've read some options articles and a book but now I want to try to a real idea / strategy. I am trying to restate the payout in terms of likelihood of the merger going through.

Based on my own familiarity with health care, especially pharmacies, I suspect the merger is more likely than not to be approved although this is an assumption. This assumption is a major contributor to why I'm even considering the move as my first options play.

The merger approval decision can come any time (AFAIK) but the deal is slotted to have a ""go / no-go"" decision in the fall, with a three month optional extension.

Here's the options idea. I would be very grateful to have any major flaws pointed out so I can continue to learn.

1. Currently able to by Jan 2017 $7.00 Call Options at ~$1.40 per share (over-estimating commissions at ~10c per share, last I checked the options trade around $1.30 per share).

2. This effectively makes the share price $8.40, which leaves a $0.60 profit opportunity if the merger is approved and the original $9 offer stands.

3. This creates an opportunity to make $0.60 / $1.40 or ~43%. Even if I take another ~10c per share haircut in the other direction, I'd still be able to make ~36%.

4. If I take the lower payout as my expected payout for the approved deal (1.36), as long as there is a &gt;= 74% chance the deal goes through at $9/share, my long run expectation is profit. As a result, if my confidence in the deal going through is greater than or equal to 74% then I should buy the call. If my confidence is less than 74% then I should not because the expectation is a loss^QQ . Math is off, probably need 80% or so on the merger to push through the loss incurred when options expire worthless (option is worth 0 but I paid money to make 0).

I am guessing the opportunity here is due to the apprehension that the deal may get squashed by the FTC, rendering the options worthless as there's very little reason to expect the company to get itself up to ~$8.40+ which is where the option starts to become profitable. I know there's a decent time premium being bought here but since there is so much uncertainty regarding the deal I think the best play is to cast a wide enough net to cover the entire decision period, despite knowing this reduces profitability.

Feedback would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance. 

^QQ Prob(rejected)xPay(rejected) + Prob(accepted)xPay(accepted) = Expected Value of Options. Solving for Prob(accepted)*1.36 *- commissions + premium* = 1 finds the acceptance probability floor to make a profit, i.e., if the likelihood of the deal exceeds this value the option is expected to be profitable.

What strategies are there? Sorry if this has been asked. Everytime I search ""options strategy"", the results are about strategies regarding spreads, arbitrage, etc.

The only strategies I know seems to be:

1. You research a company before it's 10Q, 10K, etc., or other predictable major event, then determine how the earnings report will affect stock. You buy a put/call based on this info.

2. Behavioral/pattern analysis 

What else is there?

16-05-25,4kzv90,Opinions on Tradier? (x-post from /r/investing),"What do you guys think of [Tradier](https://tradier.com)? It looks like a nice, low cost brokerage, with shorting and options, and it allows you to interface it with a number of analytical platforms. However, I tend to find that I usually get what I pay for. Low cost and free brokers are great, from a monetary standpoint, but they're not always the best in terms of reliability and support.

I rely on [Technician](https://technicianapp.com) for my charts (it's from the developers as ChartIQ) and really love the platform overall. The main reason why I'm looking at Tradier is that it can be used to trade directly from Technician. This would be extremely convenient for me and I would love to not deal with $10 fees. But, as I said, I'm concerned about reliability. I'm looking to start with a small $1,500 cash account, gradually bring in another ~$15,000 over the course of two months or so, and then deposit $500-1,000/mo into that account - depending on the path my career takes me on in the next 6 months, that number may increase to $1,000-$2,000/mo. While this isn't an enormous fortune, I'd be pretty bummed, to say the least, if the server that managed my money went down for any amount of time.

I know that Interactive Brokers is, in many ways, an excellent option for me, once I have the minimum capital available. But Tradier is still more cost effective. Similarly, the quality, versatility, and ease of use of Technician as an analytical platform makes me reluctant to work on anything else.",2

It's been in an irrevocable trust that I have no control over and have really no say at all in it. Well, now we are getting rid of it and all assets are going to me (I'm told an estimate of $36k). The bank that it's with (Regions) set me up with a meeting with a financial advisor and he wants to put it in a brokerage account because of taxes and such. Well, again I had little say in this I felt because he even wants to take my savings ($15k) and invest that also. I'm fine with him investing the trust money, all I wanted out of it was around $5k for a small bathroom remodel, but he says just to take the money out of my savings for the remodel because of taxes. The thing that gets me is again, just like the trust, there's money in my name that I can't touch or use for my benefit. It's always tied up in some sort of way with bank.

Can someone give me some direction on what I need to do or at least on what I can email him and say? Or advice on this whole situation? They don't explain things well especially to someone who has no clue on investing.

I am not looking for personal investment advice, but if you would like to know im a 27 college student and part time SEO guy. I invest about 10k USD (exchange rates vary, I have somehow stuck with 1:10 mentally between SEK and USD). ETF´s are not as popular around here it seems, because the banks prefer to offer mutuals. So the ETF market is rather limited, especially if you dont want to just dump money into another instrument for the national index. However, Deutsche Bank offers ETF trackers for most indices like S&amp;P, EUSTX, MSCI GLB etc. I read their prospectus' because they have such low fees, for example their DAX (German index) is only 0.09%, but I am not a wiz because in the same prospectus it also says they have a 3% charge on both signing and converting, then again in the fine print it says these are only applicable when trading directly with the fund, not if bought OTC.

C, +3.07% and its Japanese affiliates has been ordered Wednesday by the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission to pay a $175 million penalty for attempting to manipulate yen London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and euroyen Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR) benchmark rates. In a separate statement Wednesday, the CFTC ordered Citibank to pay $250 million for attempting to manipulate, and for falsely reporting, U.S. dollar International Swaps and Derivatives Association Fix rates. That brings the total penalties Citibank has been ordered to pay for abuses of benchmark rates to $735 million. Citibank was charged for the false reporting of euroyen TIBOR to benefit derivatives trading positions that were priced based on yen LIBOR or euroyen TIBOR, and with the false reporting of U.S. dollar LIBOR to avoid generating negative media attention during the financial crisis. ""The CFTC remains steadfast in its commitment to ensure the integrity of global benchmarks that are critical to the U.S. and international financial markets,"" said CFTC Director of Enforcement Aitan Goelman. ""As evident by today's actions, the CFTC's vigilance includes holding a financial institution, like Citi, responsible each time it acts to undermine a benchmark for its personal profit or benefit."" Citigroup's stock, which tacked on 0.8% in premarket trade, has tumbled 11% year to date through Tuesday, while the S&amp;P 500 has gained 1.6%.

16-05-25,4l03ho,Expenses of starting an equity crowdfunding campaign.,"Seeing how we hear more and more about equity crowdfunding got me thinking about a specific question - how much money does it cost to raise money? Despite the whole point of crowdfunding being, well, funding your project, you will definitely need some initial capital. 

To be clear, I’m not talking about project development expenses, but rather expenses regarding fund raising specifically. Education, building a social network for your offering, creating and keeping the documents, performing required audit and checks, crowdfunding platforms fees, marketing the offering, providing your investors with reports, insurance... All these bring either single or monthly payments cumulatively anywhere from couple thousands bucks up to $30,000. Seeing how some people consider equity crowdfunding a first step to get your project ready and attractive for classic “serious” investors like VCs or angel investors, that’s some large amount of money. 

Which in turn raises another question - to which stage of project fundraising does equity crowdfunding really belong? The way I see it now I can’t really answer this question myself. It’s an inconvenient tool to conduct a whole fundraising campaign with (due to numerous requirements and limitations both for investors and entrepreneurs), AND it’s quite exacting regarding the initial expenses to even start raising money. What do you guys think, will equity crowdfunding be able to find its place on the market and become a viable tool?",1

-------------------------
###Background
Headquartered in **Santa Clara California** and employing **9100** **employees** worldwide Nvidia designs graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming market, as well as system on a chip units for the automotive market. Primary GPU product line:""GeForce"", is in direct competition with AMD's ""Radeon"" .

**Focus on: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Centers and Auto.**


In addition to GPU manufacturing, Nvidia provides parallel processing capabilities to researchers  efficiently run high-performance applications. Deployed in supercomputing sites around the world. More recently, Nvidia has moved out of the mobile computing market, where it produced Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets, as well as vehicle navigation and entertainment systems. 

**In addition to AMD, its competitors include Intel and Qualcomm.**

--------------

#$NVDA REPORT

###Capitalization

*Sector | Industry*: **Tech  | Semiconductors**

*Price as of Post* |  *YTD%*: **$45.70** | **43.43 %**

*Market Cap*:  **23.67B** : *Large Cap*

###Revenue, Profits, Margins (FY11 - FY16)
Revenue Trend: 3.54B --&gt; 5.01B = **+41.5%**

Earnings: 343M --&gt; 780M = **+127%**

Net Margin: 10% --&gt; 15% = **+50%**

Gross Margin: 44% --&gt; 56% = **+27%**

Revenue continues to grow, with earnings growth outpacing revenue growth showing good cost cutting and efficiency within, however OpProfit margin &lt;25% so still room for improvement in this regard, dominance over comp AMD in the GPU market with customers highly choosing NVDA over AMD so solid source of cash flows that will continue for foreseeable future, in addition to branching out to automotive tech and research based processors as well as a good foot in the VR door. NVDA will continue to increase its revenue in the near-mid future. 

###Comps

Up against AMD in the GPU market, have dominantly stolen market share from AMD and continues to take customers from the struggling company, **has gone from 62% share to 82%** in the GPU market since 2011, ADM on brink of collapse/bought out so in the core GPU market NVDA is very strong. $INTC and $QCOM are other comps but the other 2 don't really go head to head with NVDA has they focus on the CPU market vs NVDA's GPU base. **TLDR: RIP AMD**

###Multiples
* **P/E**: **41.83** *pretty high* *note: that '17-'18 ests come in around 30, '16 was a really good year for NVDA* : **INTC and QCOM both have P/E of 12-14 then of course AMD has -6**. Could be a good sign that investors expecting more growth in the company but could also mean company overpriced *(as we will see later this is **by my math* false)*. Could also be sign that INTC and QCOM underpriced, etc

* **P/B: 5.57:  INTC's = 2.42 QCOM=2.77** AMD = N/A ::SSDD as above

* **Entreprise Multiple: (EV/EBITDA) : 17.15**|| INTC: 6.88 , QCOM: 9.40 |||||So again NVDA leads the way and SSDD reasons as above, no one knows for sure (welcome to finance)||||| For valuation purposes EV/EBITDA range of 13-15x used has older companies begin to get lower EM's has keeping constant EM's become unsustainable.

###Management and Ownership

* 5% Insider
* 88% Institutional
* 7% us individuals

**CEO, President and Co-Founder ^(^^what ^^a ^^big ^^boi) : Jen-Hsun Huang** : founded NVDA in 1993, holds 7300 patent assets fundamental to modern computing, invented the GPU in 1999. Been with the company his whole life obviously and knows what the fuck he's doing clearly even if he has no experience elsewhere (other BOD hacks can cover this) Holds multiple awards regarding innovation, yadda yadda, guy has led this company to success so I see no wrong here and no negative

 **Co-founder: Chris A. Malachowsky**: 30 years industry EXP, key figure in the path the company goes down, has led numerous departments throughout his time with Nvidia like stated above Malachowsky has exp at HP (rip Fiorina) and Sun Microsystems so he has that outside edge that the CEO doesn't. Also won some Emmy in 2009??? So good for him I guess


**VP and CFO: Colette Kress** : Joined in 2013 after 25 years of xp at other tech companies (mirin). Including CFO at Cisco and CFO of MSFTs ""Server and Tools"" divison. Prior to that was at TI in a variety of roles. This girl knows what's up (couldve went somewhere else for her MBA but whatcha gonna do now)

3 other BOD members but they all hold similar xp and shit

###10K Notes

NVDA 2016-10K Notes

* GeForce = #1 PC gaming platform: 2.8B +37% 77M users

* Quadro = #1 design platform 78% mrkt share

* DRIVE PX: self driving platform (70 corps using NVDAs tech)

* ITC ruled in fav of Samsung regarding patent suit

* Exited mobile market

*  Stopped building modems

* VR gonna fuck your shit up fams

###Stock History (here's where we start to go south...)

*No preferred shares*

Stock chilling at 45.75 when I began writing this 45.8 right now. As we have all seen it has completely dominated this year and as we will see later is basically at the margin of error for fair value right now. This thing was a steal a few months ago but right now you have no guarantee of gains, this will be a buy the dip kind of stock.


###Expectations

The high analyst estimate is $50 (they have 1 year timeframes), I'm getting $51 with a very conservative estimates for intrinsic value based on current figures. You can still squeeze out 5-10% perhaps on this stock but is by now means a YOLO, unless you want to delve into some &lt;monthly all or nothing 50C play. Average estimate is where the stock is right now. 

###Risks

AMD makes a miraculous comeback (as if)

The more serious one is that VR doesn't do as well as people are thinking. Even with my conservative figures VR has to at least do ""ok"" for NVDA to grow at all. VR could make or break a play on NVDA, outlook looks good but this could become the next fad for all we know. 

### Conclusion

NVDA is a buy/hold, not a sell by no means, but also not a strong buy, as I will present in my figures below it has 5-15% upside to it with 15% being really optimistic.

The company is strong and doing well, so go ahead and allocate 2%  (or 200% because what's the point to life without margin) of your portfolio towards NVDA, I myself am picking up at a Jan17 ATM call spread on the stock.

##Wait for a dip to buy in because it's not going much higher if at all 

Hope you guys enjoyed, week got busy af and I counted my chickens before they hatched so this was the most thorough one I got around to doing but will make my way through the list as I can.

16-05-25,4l0j95,AAPL - Example of why Buy low sell high works better than buying high hoping to sell higher.,"I will keep beating this dead horse until you guys take it in. 

See original post here :

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/4glx7v/here_is_where_to_buy_aapl/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link

When you buy low (on a downturn) the chances of it going straight down almost never happens. The question is, when does it rebound? You can't predict it.

When you buy High and expect higher, the chances of it going straight up also almost never happens. However, after a run, you expect a pull back at some point (people taking profit). 

So which do you think has a higher probability of success, if you're trading the same company? 

Now, this works best when you pick companies that fit the following criteria (fundamentals):

 1) Large, well traded companies. - will have patterns and well defined support/resistance  points. 

 2) Strong brand - likely be part of big player portfolios i.e pensions etc.

 3) healthy balance sheet and earnings i.e its not bleeding cash (be the cause of it losing its value, especially if its already hit a mature state).

 4) embedded into the economy in some way - less likely to go bust.

 5) pays a dividend - reduces your risk.

This works even better when you manage your risk per ticker.
What this means is, you don't throw all your cash in at one shot. You wouldn't go to a casino and throw your gambling money on black or one hand. So why would you do this here?  

How you do this is - enter into a trade incrementally. Why?  

1) you can be wrong in your pick

2) The company can have some black swan event come up

3) The market as a whole can have a black swan event


How do you incrementally enter in?

1) consider your WHOLE portfolio size. If that is 5k,10k, w.e
2) consider the size of the trade. You don't want a trade taking a large portion of your account. 
3) have predetermined price points. I go all the way down to zero, since that's the worst case scenario. 

you can do the same thing with options as well. However, that requires a little more work.

When do you think it is a good time to sell? Things to consider:

- Does a FED hike influence the stock's price, since they have a big pile of cash which will benefit from bigger interest I assume it has a positive effect on it?

- Summer is coming and I've read the market tends to slow down a bit?

- Does AAPL pay ~2%/year in dividends or am I not informed correctly, so I should be getting 0.5% (quarter) at the end of Aug?

I was thinking to wait till September after the launch of the iPhone 7. What do you think?

Not sure exactly how many shares there are.  I've tried to do a little research myself and from what I can tell they deal in comodoties like wheat and grains as well as other stuff. It looks like their stock went public in the early 80s and they started at close to zero but now they are up to $41 a share. It seems like it's a stable place for your money. But will offer a lower return than something with more risk. Of course I want to keep my stocks in something less risky for now but not sure if Archer Daniels is the best place. I think it pays dividends which is a good thing since you can use that to buy more shares.

Within hours after its launch, the campaign has secured almost £475,000 (~$700,000) from 29 investors with the largest investment being £300,000 (~$440,000).

The company currently offers a line of over 100 articles for men’s grooming. Its targeted audience are men who “appreciate quality and performance” when it comes to shaving products. 
The company stated it planed to create two monthly subscription service plans:

ShaveCare Kit: 8 shave products

FaceCare Kit: 6 different face care products.

The launch is expected to be on the 19-th of June (Father’s Day in the UK). The subscription is priced at £30 (~$45) per month. The campaign is set to close mid-June.

What is it about all these body care startups in the UK lately? And also what period of time this $450k investor's looking at. It looks like at quite an extensive one considering the nature of a project.

16-05-27,4l8izi,Trading TVIX for NOOBS,"The masterful TVIX manipulators: When TVIX gets down here at these levels it is hard to trade because they have to put so many new shares out to feed the markets appetite for fear while trying to maintain a VIX pattern and make their cut for supplying the market (which is astronomical profits for Sussi) 


When it gets down this low they know the only people trading it are themselves internally for a majority of the volume, people who are trying to make a 100-200% swing (retail/rookie traders which isn't going to happen) and pro traders. 


They know the rookie will allow them to trade all around them eventually getting bored turning their discounted shares back in to the house so all they are trying to do is out trade the pros and this is where TA people get fooled because you have Sussi competing with pro shorters who arrive at the range top sometimes too early and or right on time so they have to rapidly drop the price to entice more buying to force it back up to try and get the bears algos to cover because they are in direct competition with Sussi on covering. 


When it gets down like this the bear algos appetite gets bigger because they know they can manip it down to RS levels and Sussi doesn't mind because it will help work down the SP so they can cover too, so basically any move up is a combination of TVIX bears (market bulls) covering and new shorts taken on the S&amp;P translated through the VIX meaning investors interest in TVIX alone on the bull side through normal market orders is not enough to move this but the economic developments bring the markets interest to buy TVIX so the shorts have to beat it down so far while things are 'peachy' so that they have plenty of room to cover on a sustained move up / short covering rally. 


Knowing this you have to find blips in a trading day or weekly range lows when the TVIX bears have over extended the downward pressure on the backs of a 'panic sell'. 

The $1 trillion in short positions are being squeezed by the market and offsetting the hundreds of millions we have seen for what is it now 17 weeks straight of 200+ million taken out of the market so although we get pictures painted depicting a healthy market it is in reality not but just the art of the trade on who the market has chosen to reward. If you are in already you should be able to get a nice bounce to exit on but rest assured until VIX breaks 17 (or 18 to be safe) the downward pressure will remain and you will be able to re-buy after a sell at or below your original entry even if you miss selling the top. 


My rule of thumb is you start acquiring VIX products when the VIX is at or below 13 and max buy when VIX falls below 11. It will happen again just like last time when everyone was screaming the world is on fire TVIX to the moon while in fact TVIX steadily slid down. 

Had a little time so I figured I would bestow some knowledge on you faggots who keep losing money on TVIX.",10

1) Keep it and add pre-tax money like any other 401k to it.

2) Pay the 10% penalty + taxes and put it in a personal investment account which I contribute regular savings + net proceeds from retirement check. 

3) Roll the 401k over straight into an IRA and dump any additional post-tax retirement savings into it.

The counter to the Doha meeting is a ""line in the sand"" against further price and supply wars against oil communities, working families, and producers not only in Texas and the Southwest but across the entire US. The United States should no longer allow Saudi Arabia and the middle east to manipulate our economy by crippling our ability to produce and use our own natural resources.

I plan to sell the fund and reallocate the funds into several diversified mutual funds. Key points:


* 23 years old
* No debt, low expenses
* Making ~$30k a year
* $7k in cash savings/emergency fund
* Already maxed out Roth IRA for the year
* Risk tolerance fairly high
* Investment outlook 5-8+ years 
* No desire to actively trade - willing to pay expense ratios for mutual funds



I plan to sell the FDEQX and reallocate the $30k into the following funds. They're all transaction fee free so I can continually reallocate/increase investments:


* FUSEX - $7,500 - S&amp;P 500 index fund
* FSMEX - $2,500 - Medical equipment
* JAGLX - $2,500 - Medical &amp; biotech
* FSRPX - $2,500 - Retail
* FBSOX - $2,500 - Tech
* FFBFX - $2,500 - Banking &amp; finance
* MGGPX - $2,500 - Global equity 
* ? - remaining ~$7,500



These are all funds that have performed very well in the past. Average expense ratio is around .8% (excluding the index fund), which I'm okay with. Any concerns, comments or feedback? Where would you park the remaining $7500?

16-05-26,4l6xt1,NVIDIA DD - $NVDA - The Stock that Could,"#Name: Nvidia

#Ticker: $NVDA

#^^Accurate ^^as ^^of ^^May ^^26th, ^^2016

-----------------------

####Skip to bottom if you just want to see the DCF

-------------------------
###Background
Headquartered in **Santa Clara California** and employing **9100** **employees** worldwide Nvidia designs graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming market, as well as system on a chip units for the automotive market. Primary GPU product line:""GeForce"", is in direct competition with AMD's ""Radeon"" .

**Focus on: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Centers and Auto.**


In addition to GPU manufacturing, Nvidia provides parallel processing capabilities to researchers  efficiently run high-performance applications. Deployed in supercomputing sites around the world. More recently, Nvidia has moved out of the mobile computing market, where it produced Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets, as well as vehicle navigation and entertainment systems. 

**In addition to AMD, its competitors include Intel and Qualcomm.**

--------------

#Due(your fucking)Dilligence

###Capitalization

*Sector | Industry*: **Tech  | Semiconductors**

*Price as of Post* |  *YTD%*: **$45.70** | **43.43 %**

*Market Cap*:  **23.67B** : *Large Cap*

###Revenue, Profits, Margins (FY11 - FY16)
Revenue Trend: 3.54B --&gt; 5.01B = **+41.5%**

Earnings: 343M --&gt; 780M = **+127%**

Net Margin: 10% --&gt; 15% = **+50%**

Gross Margin: 44% --&gt; 56% = **+27%**

Revenue continues to grow, with earnings growth outpacing revenue growth showing good cost cutting and efficiency within, however OpProfit margin &lt;25% so still room for improvement in this regard, dominance over comp AMD in the GPU market with customers highly choosing NVDA over AMD so solid source of cash flows that will continue for foreseeable future, in addition to branching out to automotive tech and research based processors as well as a good foot in the VR door. NVDA will continue to increase its revenue in the near-mid future. 

###Comps

Up against AMD in the GPU market, have dominantly stolen market share from AMD and continues to take customers from the struggling company, **has gone from 62% share to 82%** in the GPU market since 2011, ADM on brink of collapse/bought out so in the core GPU market NVDA is very strong. $INTC and $QCOM are other comps but the other 2 don't really go head to head with NVDA has they focus on the CPU market vs NVDA's GPU base. **TLDR: RIP AMD**

###Multiples
* **P/E**: **41.83** *pretty high* *note: that '17-'18 ests come in around 30, '16 was a really good year for NVDA* : **INTC and QCOM both have P/E of 12-14 then of course AMD has -6**. Could be a good sign that investors expecting more growth in the company but could also mean company overpriced *(as we will see later this is **by my math* false)*. Could also be sign that INTC and QCOM underpriced, etc

* **P/B: 5.57:  INTC's = 2.42 QCOM=2.77** AMD = N/A ::SSDD as above

* **Entreprise Multiple: (EV/EBITDA) : 17.15**|| INTC: 6.88 , QCOM: 9.40 |||||So again NVDA leads the way and SSDD reasons as above, no one knows for sure (welcome to finance)||||| For valuation purposes EV/EBITDA range of 13-15x used has older companies begin to get lower EM's has keeping constant EM's become unsustainable.

###Management and Ownership

* 5% Insider
* 88% Institutional
* 7% us individual plebians

**CEO, President and Co-Founder ^(^^what ^^a ^^big ^^boi) : Jen-Hsun Huang** : founded NVDA in 1993, holds 7300 patent assets fundamental to modern computing, invented the GPU in 1999. Been with the company his whole life obviously and knows what the fuck he's doing clearly even if he has no experience elsewhere (other BOD hacks can cover this) Holds multiple awards regarding innovation, yadda yadda, guy has led this company to success so I see no wrong here and no negative

 **Co-founder: Chris A. Malachowsky**: 30 years industry EXP, key figure in the path the company goes down, has led numerous departments throughout his time with Nvidia like stated above Malachowsky has exp at HP (rip Fiorina) and Sun Microsystems so he has that outside edge that the CEO doesn't. Also won some Emmy in 2009??? So good for him I guess


**VP and CFO: Colette Kress** : Joined in 2013 after 25 years of xp at other tech companies (mirin). Including CFO at Cisco and CFO of MSFTs ""Server and Tools"" divison. Prior to that was at TI in a variety of roles. This girl knows what's up (couldve went somewhere else for her MBA but whatcha gonna do now)

3 other BOD members but they all hold similar xp and shit

###10K Notes

NVDA 2016-10K Notes

* GeForce = #1 PC gaming platform: 2.8B +37% 77M users

* Quadro = #1 design platform 78% mrkt share

* DRIVE PX: self driving platform (70 corps using NVDAs tech)

* ITC ruled in fav of Samsung regarding patent suit

* Exited mobile market

*  Stopped building modems

* VR gonna fuck your shit up fams

###Stock History (here's where we start to go south...)

*No preffered shares*

Stock chilling at 45.75 when I began writing this 45.8 right now. As we have all seen it has completely dominated this year and as we will see later is basically at the margin of error for fair value right now. This thing was a steal a few months ago but right now you have no guarantee of gains, this will be a buy the dip kind of stock.


###Expectations

The high analyst estimate is $50 (they have 1 year timeframes), I'm getting that also with a very conservative estimates for intrinsic value based on current figures. You can still squeeze out 5-10% perhaps on this stock but is by now means a YOLO, unless you want to delve into some &lt;monthly all or nothing 50C play. Average estimate is where the stock is right now. 

###Risks

AMD makes a miraculous comeback (gl with that)

The more serious one is that VR doesn't do as well as people are thinking. Even with my conservative figures VR has to at least do ""ok"" for NVDA to grow at all. VR could make or break a play on NVDA, outlook looks good but this could become the next fad for all we know. 

### Conclusion

NVDA is a buy/hold, not a sell by no means, but also not a strong buy, as I will present in my figures below it has 5-15% upside to it with 15% being really optimistic.

The company is strong and doing well, so go ahead and allocate 2%  (or 200% because what's the point to life without margin) of your portfolio towards NVDA, I myself am picking up at a Jan17 ATM call spread on the stock.

##Wait for a dip to buy in because it's not going much higher if at all 

Hope you guys enjoyed, week got busy af and I counted my chickens before they hatched so this was the most thorough one I got around to doing but will make my way through the list as I can.

**Cliff's Note: $50 Target, at 45.72 at the moment giving around 10% upside**

######DATA:https://www.dropbox.com/s/6e90885minapxam/NVDA%20DATA.xlsx?dl=0



-------------------------
###Background
Headquartered in **Santa Clara California** and employing **9100** **employees** worldwide Nvidia designs graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming market, as well as system on a chip units for the automotive market. Primary GPU product line:""GeForce"", is in direct competition with AMD's ""Radeon"" .

**Focus on: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Centers and Auto.**


In addition to GPU manufacturing, Nvidia provides parallel processing capabilities to researchers  efficiently run high-performance applications. Deployed in supercomputing sites around the world. More recently, Nvidia has moved out of the mobile computing market, where it produced Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets, as well as vehicle navigation and entertainment systems. 

**In addition to AMD, its competitors include Intel and Qualcomm.**

--------------

#$NVDA REPORT

###Capitalization

*Sector | Industry*: **Tech  | Semiconductors**

*Price as of Post* |  *YTD%*: **$45.70** | **43.43 %**

*Market Cap*:  **23.67B** : *Large Cap*

###Revenue, Profits, Margins (FY11 - FY16)
Revenue Trend: 3.54B --&gt; 5.01B = **+41.5%**

Earnings: 343M --&gt; 780M = **+127%**

Net Margin: 10% --&gt; 15% = **+50%**

Gross Margin: 44% --&gt; 56% = **+27%**

Revenue continues to grow, with earnings growth outpacing revenue growth showing good cost cutting and efficiency within, however OpProfit margin &lt;25% so still room for improvement in this regard, dominance over comp AMD in the GPU market with customers highly choosing NVDA over AMD so solid source of cash flows that will continue for foreseeable future, in addition to branching out to automotive tech and research based processors as well as a good foot in the VR door. NVDA will continue to increase its revenue in the near-mid future. 

###Comps

Up against AMD in the GPU market, have dominantly stolen market share from AMD and continues to take customers from the struggling company, **has gone from 62% share to 82%** in the GPU market since 2011, ADM on brink of collapse/bought out so in the core GPU market NVDA is very strong. $INTC and $QCOM are other comps but the other 2 don't really go head to head with NVDA has they focus on the CPU market vs NVDA's GPU base. **TLDR: RIP AMD**

###Multiples
* **P/E**: **41.83** *pretty high* *note: that '17-'18 ests come in around 30, '16 was a really good year for NVDA* : **INTC and QCOM both have P/E of 12-14 then of course AMD has -6**. Could be a good sign that investors expecting more growth in the company but could also mean company overpriced *(as we will see later this is **by my math* false)*. Could also be sign that INTC and QCOM underpriced, etc

* **P/B: 5.57:  INTC's = 2.42 QCOM=2.77** AMD = N/A ::SSDD as above

* **Entreprise Multiple: (EV/EBITDA) : 17.15**|| INTC: 6.88 , QCOM: 9.40 |||||So again NVDA leads the way and SSDD reasons as above, no one knows for sure (welcome to finance)||||| For valuation purposes EV/EBITDA range of 13-15x used has older companies begin to get lower EM's has keeping constant EM's become unsustainable.

###Management and Ownership

* 5% Insider
* 88% Institutional
* 7% us individual peasants

**CEO, President and Co-Founder ^(^^what ^^a ^^big ^^boi) : Jen-Hsun Huang** : founded NVDA in 1993, holds 7300 patent assets fundamental to modern computing, invented the GPU in 1999. Been with the company his whole life obviously and knows what the fuck he's doing clearly even if he has no experience elsewhere (other BOD hacks can cover this) Holds multiple awards regarding innovation, yadda yadda, guy has led this company to success so I see no wrong here and no negative

 **Co-founder: Chris A. Malachowsky**: 30 years industry EXP, key figure in the path the company goes down, has led numerous departments throughout his time with Nvidia like stated above Malachowsky has exp at HP (rip Fiorina) and Sun Microsystems so he has that outside edge that the CEO doesn't. Also won some Emmy in 2009??? So good for him I guess


**VP and CFO: Colette Kress** : Joined in 2013 after 25 years of xp at other tech companies (mirin). Including CFO at Cisco and CFO of MSFTs ""Server and Tools"" divison. Prior to that was at TI in a variety of roles. This girl living the dream (couldve went somewhere else for her MBA but whatcha gonna do now)

3 other BOD members but they all hold similar xp and shit

###10K Notes

NVDA 2016-10K Notes

* GeForce = #1 PC gaming platform: 2.8B +37% 77M users

* Quadro = #1 design platform 78% mrkt share

* DRIVE PX: self driving platform (70 corps using NVDAs tech)

* ITC ruled in fav of Samsung regarding patent suit

* Exited mobile market

*  Stopped building modems

* VR gonna fuck your shit up fams

###Stock History (here's where we start to go south...)

*No preffered shares*

Stock chilling at 45.75 when I began writing this 45.8 right now. As we have all seen it has completely dominated this year and as we will see later is basically at the margin of error for fair value right now. This thing was a steal a few months ago but right now you have no guarantee of gains, this will be a buy the dip kind of stock.


###Expectations

The high analyst estimate is $50 (they have 1 year timeframes), I'm getting $51 with a very conservative estimates for intrinsic value based on current figures. You can still squeeze out 5-10% perhaps on this stock but is by now means a YOLO, unless you want to delve into some &lt;monthly all or nothing 50C play. Average estimate is where the stock is right now. 

###Risks

AMD makes a miraculous comeback (lol)

The more serious one is that VR doesn't do as well as people are thinking. Even with my conservative figures VR has to at least do ""ok"" for NVDA to grow at all. VR could make or break a play on NVDA, outlook looks good but this could become the next fad for all we know.

Anyway, then I discovered PredictIt, where you buy 'stock' in political predictions. It is extremely volatile, as each stock has an end-date (Where winning predictions pay @ $1, losers pay $0). There is also a lot of pumping-and-dumping since regulation is basically non-existant.

That being said, I almost made $3,300 my first day. I had put a lot into a low-price stock of ""Trump will file less than $10mil donations for April"", and it won. Unfortunately, I had set it all to sell @ .27 per share, which was still an amazing profit - but not $3k.

Since then, I've lost a little - but I'm now easily gaining it back, by playing more conservatively and doing more DD. Just like here. I'm not making thousands a day, but I'm easily pulling $150-300 profit out of conservative wagers, and playing the margins between my average and a slightly higher price point.

Also, there are no fees unless you profit. 10% on profits only, and 5% off withdrawals. Also, cannot withdraw for 30 days. 

I like it, now that I've figured things out, and stopped shooting for the moon. It seems easy enough to milk a profit out of each day, and it certainly beats working. :O

Whats the best way (statistically) to withdraw funds from a mutual fund? Should I do something similar to a Dollar cost averaging methodology and withdraw funds gradually over time and invest into the particular index fund?

I found a lot of good portfolio recommendations from https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Lazy_portfolios.

it seems a common thread among all these portfolios is a high concentration of US domenstic stocks. So I am thinking of of initially investing in https://snapshot.fidelity.com/fidresearch/snapshot/landing.jhtml#/research?symbol=ITOT, which has a very low E.R. of 0.03 and is a total US domenstic stock market fund. 

As I learn more about investing and about the pros and cons of the various lazy portfolios in the link above, I can then start investing more money into specific assets over time to rebalance and diversify

Edit.. they actually filled it purposely at a loss a $100 loss. The bid at the time was for .20 cents a contract instead they filled it for 8 cents a contract.

Anything I can do?

More information: Apple stock strike price of $100 purchased for about 0.18 per contract and 10 contracts bought. The stock been flat all day but at close it would have made me a small $60 profit.

Also i called ameritrade and they sounded like they would give the person a much better chance at closing it out themselves.

I also asked fidelity, fidelity exercises the option contract no matter what and waits till very last minute till they do it.

Just wanting to be sure before I go through with this rather than using the TD default method. Thanks.

EDIT: I think I may be thinking more along the lines of how I think the IRS would treat selling shares at a loss and immediately rebuying them, which would probably be more of a substance-based ruling in that taking the losses are not allowed. In that case (the edit part), would the IRS allow you to keep your original cost basis and could you just wait one day and rebuy to recognize your loss? Very curious about these tax situations",3

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BvapZ9DF8oVKuyg0MeDA4nPS1iA7Ncm7pHwWDYgYIG8/edit#gid=1985722984

Past 2 days I didn't make much trades and was a bit busy to post. Today was QUITE the day, pretty good trades all around but pussied out on quantity. Overall good trading gains for today and for the week, still slightly red overall due to my net short positions I have on $SPY.

The netflix trade from this morning was a conjecture of a continued sell-off from yesterday. Turns out, it died just a bit but enough that I could make a decent amount on it. After that, it continued to fill the gap. My conjecture would have told me to keep short since we opened down, but today it did not do that - so obviously not a be-all-end-all thing. Still waiting for the day Netflix burns me on a trade lol. 

SPY was very fucking flat today before Yellen, very limited shit to play. The dance around 210.00 was intense for more than an hour. I had a hunch that we would not close above 210.00, so I decided to open up a few short calls and also sold some call spreads. Hoping for OTM expiration to collect the fat 100% gains. Got scared neared the end of the day after SPY broke 210, and closed the short calls and call spreads for a good % gain. 210.5 st calls expired worthless, however. TA worked very well today, especially with playing the rejection of 210 mid-day and playing the break of 209.7 for the upside. 

Mankiw and Yellen were great, and I must say Mankiw is a fucking character. Never realized the author of the economics books I read in school is such a fucking weird dude, but damn he made me some money. Getting straight to the point with ""the big boys needing to go to the Hamptons"" (I was fucking laughing my ass off when he said that) and prodding her about monetary policy. Right when ol' yeller opened her trap, started the short on GDX and SPY. She basically said almost everything I had expected - typical dancing around the subject with little inference. Excellent gains on both, and closed both out fairly early. The GDX puts I had were closed for 66% gain, while they were nearly up 200% around 20 minutes later. Overall a pretty good day, but need to start upping my position sizes but limited by capital as I am holding quite a few long-term positions.

This week got my ass handed by the rally, but I can thank my hedges and call ratio spreads for saving my ass to a degree. I have grabbed more call ratio spreads expiring next week as a hedge, and more VXX puts in the case of a continued rally. I've rolled some June shorts to July as well.

Have a great three day weekend everyone.

I left my old job because they offered me more money and the workplace seems way nicer and full of way less uneducated faggots who blame others for their mistakes. The people here are super nice which is surprising and literally every employee loves it there. The issue is that I'm getting another offer from Flexjet, which is owned by Onesky (not publicly traded). Flexjet is offering more money and they are also closer to my house. I don't know yet how much people like it there, but fuck it, money is all that we care about right?

2: Most of us are expecting the economy to shit itself soon, and I want to know which company will be less likely to get ass-raped by it. Btw, the aviation industry is notorious for lay-offs of new hires and just about anybody else. Embraer is a jet manufacturer, and Flexjet is a jet operator/charter company. (They rent out or manage people's planes basically) Both companies are about the same size. 

So my main question is; will Embraer be more likely to get fucked by the economy because it is a publicly traded company? Which job do you guys think is more secure?

Thank you for any advice and gfy.",3
16-05-27,4lcz0z,Which is the best ETFs for long term investing?,"To give some introduction, I am good at trading, made $30-$40k profits/year, never held ETFs or Mutual Funds.

I want to set side 30% to 50% on long term asset allocation, self managed.

I would like to invest long term and keep adding the holding starting with $10k initially and then adding minimum $1000/month with no load, less expense ratio.

Many references/blogs indicate VTI. I need to open a new account vanguard to avoid cost.

Is there any other funds or better ETFs I can consider, especially no load, low ER ETFs?

16-05-27,4la9vs,"GoPro is a good company, at a cheap price of ~$10 per share.","Let's have a discussion as to why you should or shouldn't own this stock. 

Some basic speculations/facts: 

1. Estimated addressable market of 20Bn as speculated by a Citigroup analyst.
2. Price consensus from major banks like Morgan Stanley @$45, Goldman Sachs @$11, Barclays @$25... averaged out consensus is around ~$17. 
3. Hero 5 Session coming out in October 2016, apparently will have the ""best tech"" amongst action camera's  
4. Karma Drone coming out during holidays (probably Winter) - good reviews at 2016 CES and many views on youtube for its trailer - expected to be highly advanced in commercialised drone tech. 
-Drone market is growing exponentially. 
5. Partnership agreement with 3D robotics, a drone developer - develops drones that cater to GoPro camera's. 
6. Recent acquisition of Splice, Kolor etc software apps to enhance its video editing platform. Analysts all comment this to be a good long term strategic move in creating a more sustainable platform business. 
7. Analyst estimates that the action camera market will grow 22% from 2015-19; and GoPro has been claimed to be the market leader of the AC market with a variety of sources stating a 45%-85% range in market share. 
8. GoPro gets free publicity and soft power from its users that publish footage of them doing cool stuff. Presence is decently strong in a variety of channels e.g. facebook, youtube, recent Red Bull partnership. 

Most importantly...
9. Stock was trading at ~$65 10 months ago and has crashed to $10; the value of the company fell from ~8.9bn to 1.38Bn. Net income pretty cut in half. 

edit: 
Losses made in Q12016, and Q42015, of 107.5M and 34.5M respectively. Largely due to 
1) wrong pricing of Hero4 (which led to a 50% price cut before holiday season) 
2) over-inventory (unexpectedly higher inventory, administrative costs)
-both driven by a hyped up expectations for sales 
3) Aswath Damoradan, credited investor, researched the stock twice, and placed a ~$30 valuation - read his article?

16-05-27,4laqiy,I think its time to look at $AVXL again,"So I know the last time this sub got involved with AVXL it didn't end well for a lot of people but I think its time we consider it again. They have a busy few months ahead of them and I'm expecting big developments to happen this summer.

For starters, in early June they are presenting at a biotech conference in SanFran called myBIO. I wouldn't expect news or data to be released here but the people they are presenting to at this event are what the big deal is. Pretty much all the attendees are from important big name companies in the pharmaceutical and investing industries and at the very least this is very good exposure for the company. I don't think they would be presenting here if they didn't think they had something big. Also if they aren't already in partnership talks with someone I think they will be after this event.

Next comes in late June where they will be presenting at a conference about Rett Syndrome which is the disease that their drug received the orphan drug designation for. Here I'm expecting them to announce a Phase II study in Rett's that will probably be funding by rettsyndrome.org, the same people who funded the preclinical and also stated they wanted to work with anavex again in the future. This is the disease that should get the drug fast track approval if it shows effectiveness and the trial should only take 3 months to show whether it's effective or not. There will also be a speedy enrollment because Retts current treatments are dog shit and provide essentially no benefit to the sufferers.

I'm also expecting them to present at the AAIC in late July and I think this will be the data that everyone has been waiting for. It's the biggest Alzheimer's conference with the most attendees and publicity and it's the same place where huge results were presented last year. Abstracts are past due but anavex was a late breaking presentation last year and I think they will be again. All signs point to this data being good and even if it isn't I think there will be a run up to this conference so it's still a good opportunity to buy the rumor and sell the news. We already know that 11/14 patients showed positive effect from last November so its likely that the full results will be just as impressive. Even if they aren't and those 11 patients are the only ones that saw benefits then its still better than the standard of care. To me it seems like this drug is going to easily get approved, the only thing that is variable is the time it will take. But with Retts and Alzheimers as the diseases it treats I don't think a fast track is off the table.

A lot of people are nervous because they haven't released the data yet when it seems to be well past due but I think this is due to partnership talks that aren't allowing them to release the data. Missling has stated in the past that he wants their future funding to come from a partnership and not dilution and he has stuck to his word so far and will probably continue to do so. Whenever the company is asked about the data, no matter what question you ask they always go to the word unavailable. I think by saying this they mean that they have it but it can't be released due to an NDA agreement with their future partner. They won't say incomplete or not finished or anything but only unavailable. If something else were causing the delay I think they would say it. 

Also the float is shrinking and any good news will cause a serious pop in the share price. Insiders own 9%, institutions 6% and I'm part of a Facebook group where the members own over 5% of the float and the vast majority of these members are invested for the long term. The float is definitely shrinking and will continue to due so especially with the orphan drug designations that were recently received. 

I have talked to a friend who works in the investment industry about AVXL and he said that he wouldn't invest out of fear of dilution. No one wants to invest large amounts of money in a company and then have their shares immediately worth less due to a secondary offering or something like that. I think a lot of institutions feel this way and that why I think their ownership is kind of low and why this upcoming partnership is so huge. I also think that Missling knows this since he worked in the banking and investment industry and he wants to get the funding situated just as much as the investors do. If they land it then institutions will buy in in droves (look at AQXP last September if you don't know what this can do), float shrinks, and they get a lot more publicity. 

Overall I think they have a lot going for them and this summer is when a lot of developments will take place, I own a measly 400 shares right now but I'm going to keep accumulating while it's at these low prices until I can't afford to anymore. 

Thank you and go fuck yourself. ",34

The opportunity associated with proactively leveraging DERs in the near-term is significant, creating net benefits for all utility customers, both those with DERs and those without. The impediments to capturing these benefits in practice remain significant. Utility incentives must be realigned to ensure that the full potential of DERs can be realized. Shifting the utility’s core financial incentive from its current focus of “build more and sell more to profit more” towards a future state where the utility is financially indifferent between sourcing utility owned and customer-driven solutions would neutralize bias in the utility decision-making process. 


In parallel, grid planning must also be updated to incorporate DERs into every aspect of grid design and operations, and the process itself must become radically more transparent with greater access to and standardization of data. The benefits of achieving these changes would be real and large. The greater flexibility that DERs can provide to grid planners and operators can lead to greater reliability and resiliency. Similarly, the more targeted and incremental deployments of DERs can increase efficiency and affordability. 


Finally, utilities that can successfully modernize planning would be able to fully take advantage of the assets their customers adopt. As articulated in this report, all Nevadans would benefit from continuing this discussion and taking action to fully leverage distributed energy resources to benefit the grid and its customers.

I was thinking of investing through Fidelity Brokerage link account at Fidelity, so I could directly invest in certain index funds.

I was told that I could do that and there is not additional cost of doing that. But there is a restriction particularly for my employer sponsored plan.

If you do contribute through the brokeragelink 401k account into index funds, and then decide to leave the company, you cant roll over the money from the brokeragelink 401k account into the new company. You have to cash out and move the money to the other company.

I am thinking that since this is a cash exempt account, I can sell my assets in the brokeragelink 401k account, transfer to the new 401k provider and immediately buy the same assets again. But I am not 100% sure, because I had heard something like if I sell a certain ETF/mutual fund/stock, I cant buy it again within a certain number of days. 

Is that true?

**Aspiring Options Trader Profits $2.3 Million After Confusing Puts and Calls**

“I guess I’m just that fuckin’ awesome” coughed young options trader Tony “T-Gain” Perez (who insisted I use his self-proclaimed nickname), shrugging his shoulders as he ripped a fat hit from a bong in his $1.5 million Austin penthouse.

The now-19 year old's story of success began at the start of his freshman year in Austin Community College.  On October 2nd, 2015, after opening a TD Ameritrade options account with $6,000 saved from his summers as a camp counselor, Tony bought $5,500 worth of SPY calls (betting that the S&amp;P500 would go up), buying at the day’s low of $189.12, and perfectly nailing the market’s quarterly low.  After selling the position for a profit of $283,000, Tony proceeded to buy $250,000 worth of puts on November 3rd (betting that the S&amp;P500 would fall), nailing the quarter’s high, and sold the position a few days later for a $2 million profit.  Tony then stopped trading options and bought a lavish penthouse, Porsche GT3, and seventy-six thousand dollars’ worth of gold jewelry.  

I had the displeasure of speaking with him on Friday night, in his sparsely furnished penthouse living room, sitting on a cardboard box.  “Sorry for the mess,” he explained.  “So I guess I was supposed to pay fuckin’ taxes on my money, can you believe I owe one mil for that shit?  Gotta sell this place for cash but now it’s worth like twice as much and I’m gonna be fuckin’ loaded again, lol[sic].”

I couldn’t be bothered to explain to him that the sale of his penthouse would also be subject to taxes, and instead asked why he made his near-perfect trades.  “It was fucking simple, bro” he boasted.  “I knew the market was gonna take a fat shit and fall so I bought a bunch of calls, forgot about them, and when I finally checked my account again, I’d made a couple hundred grand. Total baller move, right? Then I knew it was gonna go back up so I bought some puts and fucking made two million dollars!  I’m so fucking dope!”  

While writing down his statement, I froze with confusion - if he thought the market was going down, he would have bought puts, and would have lost nearly his entire investment.  “What do you mean?” I asked.  “If you thought the market was falling, why would you buy calls?  The market went up when you made your first trade!”  

A look of dull, empty confusion swept across his face.  “Wait then how did I make my money?”  

It was then that I realized the absurd truth behind this intolerable asshole’s trades.  He thought calls were puts - and puts were calls.  His prediction for the market could not have been more wrong, both times, but his utter lack of intelligence, combined with a disgustingly prideful ignorance, led him to make the exact opposite trades and rake in the ill-deserved gains.  The interview had turned from a look into the mind of an unlikely master, to a look into the mind of a two-bit douchebag who couldn’t tell a buy from a sell button in Thinkorswim.  

Struggling to hide my frustration, I asked how he could think a call option was a put option.  “I read some article when the market first crashed, and the dude said he totally called it or some shit.  Then I saw the call options on thinkorswim and I was like sweeeet, and bought as much as I could.”  How, though, did he manage to sell at profit without realizing the mistake?  “I just thought I was right… all those numbers were too fuckin’ much to pay attention too, I only care about the gains brah!”

I could no longer control myself, and hurriedly excused myself from the penthouse, ignoring his cry of “The fuck you goin brah?  We still gotta take those absinthe shots!”  

*From the journalist:*

*Fuck that guy, and fuck this world.  I never believed in God until last night - and now I know that not only is he real, but he’s a sadistic sonofabitch with a twisted sense of humor.  I don’t think I can take this anymore.  I need to get fucked up.  See y’all at Trudy’s, $5 meximarts are on me.*",272

I wanted to invest into the solar industry and was wondering what reddit thinks of those 3 stocks. Here my 2 cents:

First Solar:

Looks promising. Good EPS, solid current ratio, high MC. What strikes me the most that the whole industry is knee-deep in debt, only FSLR seems to be managing its debts well with a current ratio of 3,5. 

Its gross margin declined in the last quartal report, but that was the same over the whole industry because of competing prices and marginal revenue on sales. Still, it managed to lower its operational costs which leveled out the lower margin to some extend. Currently at 49, not too far from its 52wl of 40.

Trina Solar (TSL)

The chinese solar industry is still a big question mark for me. Trina Solar seems to be the biggest solar manufacturer in China. It is rapidly tapping into the Indian market ( i think African too? ) which I reckon offers unfathomable growth potential. Also it has overseeable debts which I think is crucial at times like now where the whole industrys stocks are declining.

Vivint Solar ( VSLR )

Been growing a whopping 42% on friday, and I have not a single clue why. It's a chinese company operating at a loss. Would appreciate any insight into this little gem.


I'm betting on big growth for the industry in the future, but my strategy would be to invest for 2-3 months and then to sell, investing again at a later point since im looking to I'd switch to VR/chip stock around christmas. So do you guys think theres any growth in line for those companis? What about the next 2-3 month period?",8

			Envoyer par e-mail

NEW YORK, May 27, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --







The healthcare sector is large and diverse, with biotechs, drug manufacturers, health
insurance companies all falling under its umbrella.  A rather overlooked sector are the
very small healthcare companies. While not often talked about, these healthcare companies
are still trying to prove themselves. The United States is by far the largest consumer of
the healthcare market in the world. Advanced Medical Isotope Corp. (OTC: ADMD),
Nutranomics Inc. (OTC: NNRX), KollagenX Corp. (OTCQB: KGNX), Bioelectronics Corp (OTC:
BIEL)



Within healthcare, a large segment in the industry is not being discussed as often,
but yet there are roughly 7,000 medical device companies in the U.S., which are small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). According to SelectUSA.gov approximately 80% of medical
device companies have less than 50 employees. It is also an industry that includes many
innovative start-ups, and micro-cap companies.



Medical devices can range across a broad spectrum of innovation. Advanced Medical
Isotope Corp. (OTC: ADMD) for example, is a medical device company focused on late stage
radiation oncology. The company is currently working on a product called RadioGel, an
yttrium-90 based brachytherapy (internal radiation) device for the treatment of
non-resectable tumors.



Shares of Advanced Medical Isotope have been trending up in recent months after the
company announced the formation of a new, wholly-owned subsidiary, IsoPet Solutions
Corporation, to focus on the veterinary oncology market. The company announced, they are
planning to attend two upcoming investor conferences and plans to continue our efforts
commercialize our Y-90 RadioGel(TM) device and IsoPet Solutions.



Nutranomics Inc. (OTC: NNRX) is a research and development of nutritional food
products since its inception in 1995. Nutranomics provided research and development of
supplement formulations and nutraceuticals for domestic and international brands. After
developing 100's of successful formulations and patents, Nutranomics developed its own
brand of nutraceuticals in 1997, Nutranomics(R), and began to market and sell its products
directly to consumers and into retail outlets.



KollagenX Corp. (OTCQB: KGNX) is a California based cosmetic company that's main focus
is nano gold technology also known as NGT(R). KollagenX(R) was formed by Rondell Fletcher
and George Huerta in early 2008. KollagenX(R) develops and introduces new safe, more
affordable eco-friendly NTG(R) products that will help improve the quality of lives. The
company's unique anti-aging skin care products restore a natural youthful glow and a
smoother, supplier appearance. KollagenX(R) helps bring the nourishment your skin needs to
be healthier and function more effectively.



Bioelectronics Corp (OTC: BIEL) is a leader in biophysics and the maker of an industry
leading family of disposable, drug-free, pain therapy devices: ActiPatch(R) Therapy,
over-the-counter treatment for back pain and other musculoskeletal complaints; RecoveryRx
(R) Devices for chronic and post-operative wound care; Allay(R) Menstrual Pain Therapy;
and HealFast(R) Therapy for dogs, cats and horses.

Looking back into their studies it seems that their implant is nearly 95% more effective than all the other treatments and it doesn't have nearly as many side effects. Also in the beginning of April the fda voted unanimously to have an accelerated approval for it, so to me it seems almost guaranteed that it will be approved. However if people are very positive about the approval will it still have a large effect on the stock price if it's accepted? If you think so you fuckers better get in now.

16-05-28,4li5ip,"New investor with a bunch of noob questions about TSLA's latest SEC filing.","Hello, I'm very new to investing, and I have some questions regarding a recent SEC filing.  Full disclosure, I made my very first stock purchase ever a few months ago, and it was TSLA.  I thought it was crazy that the stock was selling off right before the unveil of a new vehicle that I was already making plans to literally camp out for. I invested a significant portion of my savings into it, and I was a bit lucky as a got in at the bottom of a very steep valley.

Now that I'm a shareholder, I'm making an effort to stay informed about Tesla's financials.  Specifically, I'm trying to make sense of their latest SEC filing in which the company is conducting a secondary stock offering (my understanding is that this is not their first).  The filing in question can be found [here](http://ir.tesla.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1193125-16-596657&amp;CIK=1318605), and in particular, page ""S-2"" is where I have the most questions.  My first questions are about the stock that the ""company"" is offering so that they can fund their accelerated vehicle production ramp.  They are putting up for sale 6,519,659 shares to everyone and an additional 1,395,348 shares to the under writer Goldman Sachs if they so choose.  But of course they will choose to do so since Goldman Sachs 'n Friends upgraded TSLA to a ""buy"" rating just 11 hours before Tesla's announcement...... wow [magic](http://i.imgur.com/iZcUNxH.gif). I guess they don't even have to hide it anymore.  So my question is **1. Are all of these 7,915,004 shares completely new and just created?**  I believe that answer is yes, so my next question is **2. Don't companies own their own stock as well?  I mean that's what ""buy backs"" are for right, so why wouldn't Tesla just sell some of the stock that the company owned itself instead of diluting shares?**  My next question is **3. How are these stocks actually sold?  Are they just kind of slipped in the mix one day with all the other trading or are they sold separately somehow?**  Also, **4. Are the shares that Goldman Sachs gets to buy set at a specific price, or do they buy at the going rate at the moment they decide to buy?**  Next question is **5. Do funds raised during public offerings get taxed?**

The rest of my questions involve the specific sale of stock by Elon Musk.  Here is a quote from the the Filing:

&gt;In connection with this offering, Mr. Musk will exercise, in full, outstanding fully vested stock options to purchase an aggregate of 5,503,972 shares of common stock that are set to expire on December 3, 2016. Mr. Musk will offer 2,782,670 of these shares as common stock in this offering. All of the net proceeds Mr. Musk will receive upon such sale will be used to satisfy taxes that he will incur in connection with the option exercise. As a result of this option exercise and sale, and even after giving effect to Mr. Musk’s donation of 1.2 million shares of our common stock owned by him to charity, the net result of these transactions is that the number of shares of our common stock held by Mr. Musk will increase.

My first question about this is **6. What would happen if Musk's stock options ""expired""?**.  So I'm assuming that Musk has the option to buy 5,503,972 shares at some really low price. **7. So who fulfills this?  Who has these 5,503,972 shares laying around that they are going to have to part with for $5 a piece?**  Which also leads me to ask **8. Why don't they mention what option price Musk gets to exercise at?**  Shouldn't this be public?  Also, it seems like some math isn't adding up right.  They say ""Musk will offer 2,782,670 of these shares as common stock in this offering. All of the net proceeds Mr. Musk will receive upon such sale will be used to satisfy taxes that he will incur in connection with the option exercise.""  **9. Assuming best case, Musk will pay 0$ for his 5,503,972 shares, the top tax bracket in the US is not %50, it's %40. Plus, he's given 1.2 million shares to charity.  So how can this be a true statement about all of the proceeds going to tax?**   And finally, **10. How can they say ""the net transactions is that the number of shares of our common stock held by Mr. Musk will increase when he's selling 2,782,670 shares and giving 1.2 million shares to charity?""  I mean, this may be ""technically"" correct, but in the end, he is passing up on owning 5,503,972 shares by getting rid of over half of them.**",87

I personally think Chipotle handled the E-coli issue fairly nicely. Some of the biggest American restaurant chains have faced similar food safety incidents in the past; a few were hardly pinched, while others took years to recover. Chipotle's sales declined in the first quarter as expected, but this is a temporary setback as the company keeps opening new restaurants to spur future growth.

If the market is assuming Overwatch will bring in a ton of revenue along with the Warcraft Movie then part of that is already in the current share price.

This allows companies to raise up to $50 million from accredited and non-accredited investors. Seems like we can buy a stake in one of many start-ups, being a non-accredited investor. At first glance, everything is simple and attractive. But I doubt somewhat and think that this opportunity has some disadvantages, maybe it can bring losses, high risks or something like that. What do you advise? What does this mean for small businesses or start-ups that are looking for a good financing? Is it likely to lead to investor fraud or to start-up's failure?",1
16-05-29,4limes,What is the best learning resources for an absolute beginner.,"Hey I'm very new to all this and want to know what the best resources are for complete beginners. I've been browsing this subreddit and looking at tutorials on youtube and I've been feeling overwhelmed by the terminology and jargon, after spending 8 hours a day on the internet for the past 3 days researching day trading and penny stocks I still don't know what I'm getting into. There are a lot of fancy words I don't understand. I don't really understand what volume is. I made a Etrade and a RobinHood account. Some people say that Robinhood is awesome, some say it sucks, some say I should have went with TD Ameritrade instead of Etrade, idk. I deposited $1000 into both of these platforms and for some reason they said I can't access my money until June 3rd, I don't know why that is. I'm not sure if my bank account is verified or not, it says I have $1000 in my net account value, but I can't access it for whatever reason for another week. I saw some screenshots and videos on Youtube of people using this fancy platform thats red and green and has a bunch of options. Etrade and Robinhood don't seem to give me such a complex platform. People are using google alerts, I don't know what that is or how to use it correctly.

Yeah so I'm stuck, I guess I can't do anything until Friday anyway, all I can do is keep reading and watching tutorials. Anyone got any recommendation?",10

Yes and no. Companies should start stimulating (fracking) the heavy inventories of uncompleted wells. A boom again? Hardly. With more drilling of uncompleted wells at $50, American Southwest unconventional production rises. Saudi Arabia and the Gulf nation producers would see once more the threat to market share which started the bust in the first place.

Higher oil prices equate to more production and energy-related banks and funds might find new borrowers. Is this the constraint of lower and longer oil prices? It doesn't matter what supply forecasts come from traders’ prattle on cable TV. The final half of 2016 will be negative on price and oil demand. The price war with Saudi Arabia/OPEC continues.

There are three counter-strategies to Saudi Arabia and OPEC from American shale oil producers and communities:

Our creditors will soon stop loaning us money.  The federal debt will default, or inflation will rise to the highest level in our history.

Given that, how to invest?  If the coming inflation is hyperinflation, I'm not sure how owning assets will help since no one will be able to afford them, but the U.S. dollar will be devalued so my cash will become pennies on the dollar.  If inflation is merely extremely high, then maybe owning hard assets like real estate is the answer.  I have my doubts about TIPS in either scenario.  They won't be honored once this all starts happening.  Is investing in foreign economies and assets the answer?

What do you all think?  I know I'm in the minority in thinking that the federal debt is a serious problem but in my opinion it is our biggest threat.  Just because the world is crazy doesn't mean that I am too.

EDIT:  Thank you for the comments, particularly ddd333ddd.  To those who responded so far:  Doesn't the $20Trillion in federal debt concern you?

I was reading about inverse bond ETFs on investopedia, (http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/091115/top-4-inverse-bonds-etfs.asp)

and didn't quite understand this paragraph in the introduction:
""Most inverse bond ETFs only seek to provide inverse exposure to the daily performance of their underlying indexes, and therefore should not be held for periods longer than one day. If investors wish to hold inverse bond ETFs for periods longer than one day, they must rebalance their positions on a daily basis to mitigate the effects of compounding returns.""

In researching this ETF I notice that the price has grown at all. In fact the price has gone down over the years. And yet I see plenty of articles that recommend purchasing this ETF, like [this](http://www.etf.com/SCHE) or [this](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3479016-sche-emerging-markets-volatile-rebalance-regularly) for example.

So I must not be seeing the whole picture of this ETF, and why it's  good for my aggressive portfolio. I want to understand though, so that I can make good decisions about it in the future. Should this be something I hold until the price goes up and then sell?",1

2. Some risk is okay. Most of the wedding is already paid for. The money I'm putting in is mostly for the honeymoon and other niceties. If I lose even 30-40% that's about as much as I'd spend on dumb shit in the next year while it was in my checking.

I'm interested in a variety of companies, spend time researching and forecasting. When I see a company I like dip or I think it's undervalued I start a position.

My problem is then I watch it go up and hear more news and see it's probably worth even more. 

When do you buy more ? It seems like my once 25% gain could be averaged out at much lower. 

Do I sell to take 25% and hope it dips ? Quite often it doesn't seem to play out that easy and I think: "" I should have just bought more..""

I tried it for the first time on 5/24 doing a bullish spread on AMD October puts, starting slightly above the bid and moving my bid up by .01 until it filled, and the best fill I was able to get was selling the $3.50 strike for .38 and buying the $3 strike for .24, so after commissions I was only looking at a credit of $120 for a risk of $380.

edit:

ok, so

CJES has until TOMORROW to avoid defaulting on their loan.  this explains the drop and the run-up.  these people are gambling that CJES will not default.  their next quarter should be more profitable with oil going up.  good investment if they are squared away on their loan tomorrow

side note, their director dropped a good $10M into shares when they were $17-18 per share a few years ago.  he/she never sold them

BK is a possibility here, so missing the train might actually be a good thing

with oil on the rise if cjes makes it out of this short term mess, they could be worth exponentially more very quickly

*Investors typically freak out when they lose 10% in their retirement assets. Liquidating positions after losing 10% is not a bad idea, because many times the market continues to go down. But what kills them is that they take too long to get back into the market. That’s an interesting behavioral irregularity.*


http://www.barrons.com/articles/alternatives-monthly-andrew-los-strategy-1464408662?mod=wsjhp


I agree that people should cut their losses when the market falls and vol spikes. What do others think? Most objections I hear against doing this in /r/investing is Lo's point that investors don't reenter the market afterwards. The solution is to get back in when when vol subsides.

16-05-28,4lgmo0,529 plan as tax-deferred retirement account,"It seems to me that long term, putting money away in a 529 plan may result in less tax than a brokerage account.

According to [litterature](http://www.savingforcollege.com/intro_to_529s/what-is-the-penalty-on-an-unused-529-plan.php) upon withdrawal for non-education expense (retirement), appreciation is taxed at income-level plus 10%.

In a brokerage account, appreciation would be taxed at long-term gains. But every year dividends would be taxed at income-rate, and that's where the once-a-time 10% penalty of the 529 would make sense. 

Let's say in the brokerage account dividends are 3% each year for 20 year, taxed at 35%. The overall tax due to dividends is 1.05% per year. Compounded over 20 years,  that's 23%, more than twice the 10% withdrawal penalty of the 529. Using these percentages, 529 takes the lead after 9.12 years (ln(1.1)/ln(1.0105).

So when all other deferred tax investment options are exhausted, the 529 is more tax-efficient than a brokerage account.

Rumors have been circulating for months.

Netflix is cash flow negative.

Netflix has operating losses.

Apple is lucky. They do not NEED to buy anyone at the moment. Their main business is still a cash cow. They have a terrific R&amp;D department, and a top class management team. To buy a company for the sake of buying to increase revenues makes no sense, and to me that is all that would be gained by acquiring Netflix. Netflix is too big to buy. Also,at the current market cap they do not generate enough income to justify being bought out. Apples $55 billion cash and cash equivalents hoard will not and should not be spent on Netflix. But the Netflix bulls already knew that didn't they?

Treasury Yield --- The interest rate the U.S. government pays to borrow money for different lengths of time. The ten-year Note influences many financial mediums Remember low bonds or interest rates = higher stock market, high bonds or interest rates = lower stock market. This bond, which is sold at auction by the U.S. government, also tends to signal investor confidence. When confidence is high, the ten-year treasury bond's price drops and yields go higher because investors feel they can find higher returning investments and they do not feel they need to play it safe, but when confidence is low, the price goes up as there is more demand for this safe investment, and yields fall. https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yieldYear&amp;year=2016

The Yen is a historically low-yielding currency, making an attractive vehicle to fund carry trades (where traders borrow cheaply in JPY to buy higher-yielding currencies, including NZD).

The wife and are aiming for $2MM as our FI number (shout out to r/financialindependence), so this is a big milestone.  We are technically shooting for $1.8MM, but I figure we might as well round up to an even deuce. Also, that technically would make us ""multi millionaires"", so that's pretty sweet.

70% is long term investments (401k, IRAs, HSAs, taxable long-term accounts) [link to portfolio](https://hellomoney.co/portfolio/2d2423-new-normal-portfolio)  
25% is my trading account, with which I mostly trade volatility and options  
5% is a leveraged bond/equity portfolio I'm playing around with that is: 40% SSO, 20% UPRO, 20% EDV, 20% TMF, re-balanced after 5% moves.  I hold leveraged funds elsewhere, but this one is specifically allocated for it.

From a returns perspective, I'm still down for the year from the Jan/Feb turmoil, when I learned some expensive lessons in position sizing in my trading account.  I've taken some hits in the last 12 months on various SCTY, SUNE, AAPL, USO trades (not necessarily all longs) and others, but not too much in the grand scheme of things.

The way I see it, there are 2 ways to place your money with intention. First you can think about long/short term confidence you have in a investment moving in a certain direction. The second is to place your money on your confidence of speculation of others in the market.

The second example above causes move volatility, risk+reward opportunities.
I know this is old news for most experienced guys and gals here so I'll get to the point.

I've seen some deep and silly conversations about cryptocurrency on here, but I feel if we take away the stigma we can see there are strategies to extract wealth from those markets.

1) They are very emotional
2) They are tech driven projects so they lack true deep confidence among the populous
3) They have sustained for the past 5+ years so they're probably not going away.
4) They attempt to represent economic models that are well studied in previous economic lessons or simulations.

With all that stated, I've simply followed the highs and the lows of those communities and I've made out very well... When all is depressed I buy, when things are euphoric, I sell.

16-05-29,4lm5c5,"Should I follow Schwab's investment portfolio?"," This is a duplicate post from the daily question thread in an attempt to get some other views/thoughts (if that's against the rules, my apologies):
Super new to investing so forgive me if I don't know the terminology. I have maxed out contributions to 2015/2016 ROTH IRAs. On generic advice from a friend I put 2015's contribution into GTLLX. In hindsight really we're both investing noobs and probably was a mistake to just follow blindly, and even moreso to go all-in on one fund. After doing some more research it also seems if I'm going for long term, I should try to get something with a lower expense ratio as 0.87 will add up over time.
I'm 30, a resident physician making 60k, the salary will likely increase to the 250-350 range (give or take) when I finish residency but that's not for another 3 years.
I don't know what my objective is, I *should* have financial security through my career so when it comes time to buy a house, hopefully I won't have any issues there. So I guess it'll be for retirement.
I think my risk profile would be aggressive.
Currently: 5500 GTLLX (Roth IRA), ~1050 SCTY (brokerage acc)
I don't intend to use this money in the near future, although if for some reason a huge purchase comes up I may need to pull (although I know I can't do that without incurring a penalty fees/taxes save for a few exceptions) Ideally, wouldn't be using it for another 20-30 years.
Debt: Student loans ~430k (yup, medschool + 7.8% interest sucks) although I will likely be applying for public service loan forgiveness after 10 years since I will be working for 503c hospital following residency.
I have a schwab brokerage/roth ira acc and was looking at what to do with my 2016 contribution. They have their own ETF portfolio template based on risk profile that suggested: 
50% SCHX 
20% SCHA 
5% SCHE 
20% SCHF
I was planning to sell all my GTLLX and use all of that to purchase SWPPX since it has a much lower expense ratio (I know there's more to picking where to invest than an expense ratio, but it seemed like index funds tend to be a good bet?)
Is this a *good* idea? Any insight, thoughts, or advice is appreciated.

16-05-30,4lpuyl,Thought this was interesting,"""Technicians use these surveys to help determine whether a trend will continue or if a
reversal could develop; they are most likely to anticipate a change when the surveys report extreme investor
sentiment. Surveys that show overwhelming bullishness, for example, are evidence that an uptrend may reverse – the
premise being that if most investors are bullish they have already bought the market (anticipating higher prices). And
because most investors are bullish and invested, one assumes that few buyers remain. This leaves more potential
sellers than buyers, despite the bullish sentiment. This suggests that prices will trend down, and is an example of
contrarian trading.""",5
16-05-30,4lpv3p,[Stock pricing] Effects of convertible bonds in share price,"Hi! 

So my question is how Convertible bonds affects a stocks pricing, specifically their effect after they've been executed. Let's say you have a company valued at 100$ Million. Outstanding stocks: 100 million (share price 1$).

A debt owner executes his right to convert his bonds to stocks. Debt converted: 50$ million. Stock price issued at 0,5$ (100 million new stocks). What will be the new stock price and the total value of the company? 

My attempt at working the problem:
Shares 200 million
Value of company: 100$ million + 50$ million = 150$ million
New share price: 150$ Million / 200 million = 0,75

Thanks in advance!

16-05-29,4lmjyn,AAAP PDUFA thoughts,"So, AAAP has its approval date for somakit-TATE set for June 1st. I really think that this could be a good buy for several reasons and I will explain them below:

-It involves cancer: I know it's a hard topic to talk about but cancer is a huge issue these days and everyone is looking for ways to help prevent or cure cancer. The product AAAP is hoping to release is a kit that helps to identify and cure neuroendocrine tumors which are small sometimes cancerous tumors that appear in most parts of the body. In other words, this could be a huge money making opportunity for the company if it is accepted. 

-The extension was nothing to worry about: Yes the approval date was extended for a period of time but this was not due to insecurities about the product. On the SEC filing that is provided on the calender on the biopharm website, the extension was only due to the fact that the company had previously submitted the forms in Italian and the fda asked for a copy in English. Here's the exact quote if you dont feel like reading the file. ""In response to a recent request from the FDA and prior to a Late-Cycle Review Meeting, AAA submitted English translations of documents such as validation reports and manufacturing documentation, which had previously been submitted in Italian and in summary form in English. Due to the timing of this submission, the FDA extended the PDUFA date to allow additional time for review of the English translated documents. The FDA has not asked for additional clinical data at this time.""

-The potential of the product: As of now there are a few products that do the same type of identification as this product. However, most to all of them aren't super effective, they cost a ton, and they require extensive control testing. On the other hand Somakit-TATE uses a new innovational method that is cheaper and way more effective. Here's my source for that from the same sec filing. ""Somakit-TATE has the potential to offer a standardized procedure for producing diagnostic compounds based on 68Ga without the need of expensive pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment and extensive quality control testing."" 

-Priority Review Grant: In September 2015 the fda decided to grant this new drug priority review. While most feel this may be a bit skeptical it is actually a very positive signal. The reason for this is that the main reason the fda grants priority review to a drug is because it may have potential to greatly help a medical issue that is very serious and even deadly. This was also found in that sec filing and here is the direct quote. ""The FDA had granted Priority Review to AAA’s New Drug Application (NDA) for SomaKit-TATE in September 2015. A Priority Review designation is granted by the FDA when a proposed drug exhibits the potential to offer a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of a serious condition.""

In all this company is being extremely under sold and has the potential to grow tremendously with both this and a series of other drug releases coming soon. So,  please let me know what you think.",6

16-05-30,4lqa7x,Fundamentals Spreadsheet,"I've just opened a brokerage account and I'm intending to invest in a few stocks.  I'd like to make my decisions based on fundamentals and to be consistent with those decisions (not intuitive or emotional).  So I'm looking for a spreadsheet which can do the following:

* Track all the basic stock fundamentals evaluations
* Pull in data by entering a ticker symbol
* Watchlist

and most importantly

* track reasons for buying and selling and also *not* buying and *not* selling.

The latter will help me improve my decision making as I go along.  If I decide to buy because of a P/E metric, I want to know what the value of the P/E metric was at that time I made that decision.  If that's my reason for owning a stock then it will help me decide when it's time to sell it.

I'm certain that a tool like this must exist already, can anyone recommend one?

I plan on investing in the next few days, so I'm hoping for something like a quick and steep drop down to $450/1 then another spike tob$525/1, OR a steady incline up to $600. The only slight gamble that I would be taking is that I convince myself that the climb is going to maintain it's pace, buy in, and be stuck while it drops back down to the price of last week: $450.

So I've put a decent position in a particular stock, and it has so far generated a very good return (about 70-80% over the past 3 or so months - I invested in an oil stock right near the bottom).

The stock traded at $50-60 before the huge oil crash, and it is trading at about $10-$12 now. I bought it at about $6 or so. While I don't think it'll go bankrupt, I'm worried about the possibility of losing my money if it does.

My question is this - the price to book ratio is currently about .22. As far as I can tell, this seems to suggest that the stock is significantly undervalued, and that even if the assets were liquidated, they'd more than cover the cost of my investment (that's assuming that the assets sold for near cost, or even at a moderate discount - 30% to 50%) - is that a correct understanding of what's going on here?

16-05-30,4lrpql,[YOLO] My next super-yolo: Short YANG,"1) China stock market is way undervalued due to short manipulators who pushed it down by nearly 40%

2) China is still growing at 6%+ rates per year, no matter what the liars and crooks cackle on every blog that will accept to hear them.

3) Many chinese companies trade at ridiculously low valuations (China Mobile, BABA, etc.)

4) Of course, I don't know enough about China to buy individual stocks (safe for BABA, which is perfect). That is why I want to play an index.

5) Shorting YANG makes even more sense due to the leverage AND the massive decay.

6) Even if the shanghai index is still at 2800 a year from now, I will be up by 15-20% (!). Shorting YANG is a GREAT way to play bull on the chinese stock market.

7) The Chinese government will not let China stock market crash. I am utterly convinced it has bottomed out and a HUGE bull run has to be coming in a year or two.

8) Shorting YANG is the best way I can think of right now to make money with minimal risk. 

Expect a post tomorrow with my trade. I am looking to short roughtly $50k-100k USD, perhaps keeping some for doubling down if needed.",45

Why did the first trade open at $25 according to http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/cpxx/premarket?time=, despite closing the previous trading day at 17.53.

* Positions on oil can also be supplemented/replaced with small cap companies (SDRL, CHK, etc.). [Read this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/4bvbtl/how_to_properly_yolo_oil_a_dd_guide/)
* S&amp;P has a LOT of ETFs that let you target specific parts of it (small/mid cap, tech, etc.), definitely do some research
* VIX has no leveraged inverse, use XIV or another one (google is your friend here). 
* Technically TVIX tracks short term VIX futures. Also TVIX is a cruel bitch that will take your money and spit on you, tread with caution.
* Another note on the VIX, usually if you're buying it because you believe a downturn is coming there are better tools. VIX is shitty, avoid it.
* There's many different ETFs for so many different things (like EWY for S. Korea), do some research. Just make sure the volume on it is high enough.",30

I have ~40k saved up in an emergency fund in case something really bad happens to me. 

That being said, I want to put in a relatively small amount of money (5k or so) in two or three stocks that I believe will do well.

16-05-31,4lwrrh,Epic YOLO on...Bogleheads?!,"I came across this thread on Bogleheads.com the other day and had to share it here for people that haven't seen it. If you have seen it already, GFY, no one cares.  You all know Bogleheads.com as a place where those boring old Vanguard people congregate (like an even more r/investing version of r/investing) so you wouldn't expect their forums to have anything remotely resemble a YOLO on them.  But, WOW, there is a YOLO on here that makes 99.9% of what's on this sub seem tame. 

[Link to the thread](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5934)

Basically, some guy that is an econ grad student with a slightly negative net worth follows the Mortgage Your Retirement (MYR) plan (leveraging your retirement by borrowing heavily to invest in a diversified stock portfolio).  This guy does *literally* everything wrong.  First, he starts investing in September of 2007.  Second, he goes heavy in financials and real estate.  Third, he starts with entirely too much leverage, especially relative to equity prices at the time. Fourth, he moves from limited downside intstruments (e.g. LEAPS) to unlimited downside instruments (e.g. futures) at a terrible time.     

As you can imagine, given his financial situation, timing, and investments, this goes south really fast.  He starts getting margin calls and forced liquidations almost immediately.  He continues to, over the course of the next two years, post collateral and pump capital into his accounts to fund this shitshow.  He maxes out credit cards, takes cash advances, takes on personal loans, borrows from family, etc as the market continues to drop.  It is like a train wreck you just can't look away from, but with the added twist of dramatic irony, since we have the benefit of knowing what ended up happening with the market, like a movie where a character doesn't know the monster is right around the corner but you do.  For example, there are threads around fall of 2008 where he and others in the thread are saying ""ok, as long as the market holds at 1200, it'll be fine!  Surely this is the bottom!"", and of course we know the market shed another ~500 points/40% more from that point, making it that much more entertaining.  

He actually remains remarkably calm throughout the whole thing, and it's impressive how much he comments and keeps up with it while going through the ordeal.  At one point I believe he had a net worth down around a negative quarter million.  Shockingly, he has since rebounded (as of late 2011) and managed to remain solvent.  He posted somewhat recently, so he is still alive and apparently with a positive net worth coming up on high six figures. The guy has brass balls and an iron stomach, even if he got off on the wrong foot due to a fantastic amount of hubris and a staggering lack of foresight.  Get a cup of coffee and a snack, because this thread is *long* but it is worth the read.  

**TL;DR: Guy on Bogleheads heavily leverages himself into financials and RE stocks just before the 08 crash, goes 250k in the red, and somehow manages to stay solvent until market turns around and breaks even sometime in 2011. He is the true patron saint of WSB and we are all plebs compared to him.**

16-05-31,4lshj8,Investing advice for a hostel in key west,"Main questions: what do I need to know about a commercial/upscale backpackers style hostel? 
What do I look out for with commercial properties?
How much is negotiable(say.. It has aspestos. And there a virtually no bathrooms) can I get the current owner to drop the price or just fix the problems first?
What is the best way to fund the project?
Should I get croud funding ? Is there anyway to bring this massive 14,000,000 building back from the dead?  Also, I went and talked to the owner 10 years ago.. He still hasn't been able to do anything with it in all this time. I worked out the details once it was all set up.. And if it was half full during the busiest time it would still take care of it's property taxes and everything.. (which it would be full through the whole busy season most likely)

If you've made it this far. Thank you. Any input or questions would be greatly appreciated.



 I lived in this cityfor 6 years. They do not have a hostel/backpacker style place that's cool. Just an old youth hostel/run down serial killer place.. Having traveled the world, I feel hostel/backpacker offer a unique experience.. Insta-family, cheaper than getting a hotel and more fun in general.. I have studied them and feel I could make a very successful one. This city has a ridiculous tourist rate where hotels routinely sell out.. The people who come for to the main week of intense festivity alone would love and sell out this kind of establishment. Enough to get it though the slow season. While I would still be raking it in through the busy season in general (4-5 months). There is a property that needs a lot of work. That I want. It's huge. Which is rare for this little city.  How can I get it going the quickest? ",10

16-05-31,4lvkwb,Thoughts on the poop industry and other..,"Newbie here! I am 23 y.o. and decided to put an *x* amount aside in order to invest in prospect of future gains, let's say in order to retire an hour earlier (a *decade* wouldn't be that bad either) and enjoy the life. I've done some research here and there, but my exposure is still minimal and thus would appreciate any input on a couple of thoughts.

1. Wastewater treatment/Fertilizer production. I recently stumbled upon [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QV9x79_WYbk). 
 **TL;DW:** The industry basically gets paid to ""clean up"" and is eventually left with ready-to-sell fertilizer as an end-product. Considering that the human population is rising and is prospected to reach even higher levels in the coming decades, doesn't that mean that there's only one way to go for these stocks? And then, what are the implications for places such as India and China?
2. Crude oil. It is speculated that the last barrel will be pumped by mid-2030. Due to lack of reference (I remember reading this in some worldcounter statistics website) and for argument's sake, let's consider this to be true. Along with the 10-year low (〜30$) of early 2016 and the current 〜49$, won't prices skyrocket hereafter as the last reserves are being depleted? *And thus*, wouldn't now be the better time to direct capital towards that direction (the best being early 2016 and its 〜30 low)?
3. This is going to be somewhat broader and more advice-oriented. I'm quite energized by my current line of work and thus have no plans of shifting into a full-time trader tracking market changes, news and such on a day-to-day basis (without however, meaning a need to be completely oblivious). I am merely interested in investing that extra income in what the future holds, in terms of aerospace, (bio)agriculture, biofuel and renewable energies, virtual/augmented realty and gaming, medicine (devices/instruments/biomed/nanomed/drugs), robotics, nanotech and alternative forms of currency (digital/crypto).
My budget isn't that insane. I have an initial 5k eu, while I'm considering to funnel another 250-500 per month into the ""project"" if all goes well. Since I'm looking to chip-in and wait while spending minimum time supervising the whole process, how do you suggest I proceed? Focus the € on an index, individual companies, or a little bit of both? In either case, which ones do you find promising and why? Furthermore, order stock or LEAP options?..Or perhaps, something along the lines of Betterment and the sorts?

16-05-31,4lvsnj,Global warming investments,"What are your opinions on areas to invest concerning global warming?

I had started exploring refrigerant manufacturers, the big brand name to me being freon, but Dupont spun off all of that business into Chemours which is largely a sinking ship right now and subject to several controversies.

I also considered international REITs. Warming around the world could cause a large migrations of people, so would rising sea levels.

Lots of people moving means lots of people needing housing. Wouldn't this also raise the overall value of real property?

Additionally (and a little sadly), guns. Massive migrations of people raises the chance of civil unrest. Since there are a lot of major players in this market, maybe VICEX?

Additionally, maybe energy companies would be an angle to play. More people moving into a country means significantly more load on their power grid. That would mean the same thing, but you also add the ability to purchase energy from neighboring countries.

With increasing scrutiny on heavily-polluting energy sources like fossil fuels, renewables seem to most likely get more and more attractive to consumers.

Jazz isn't exactly a mega pharma. Buy Roche, Merck, amgen are. And they all would benefit to a fat greater degree than jazz would. 

There technology platform of cpxx is simple and it works, thus any drop from $30 is going to go for a premium on the next inevitable offer. My word.

The worst thing that can happen now is cpxx says ok tomorrow and the deal is over.

So if you're in, stay in.
If it drops from delay or denial, buy more.

If you're not in yet buying under 30.25 isn't a loss of course, but it's not exactly enticing if the jazz deal is accepted.

Looking forward, renewable energy is just the direction humans will obviously be heading. The market is over saturated with solar companies. While i do like the concept of Solar energy; its biggest flaw is the inefficiency of the panels. $TSL apparently has the most effective solar panels( Still less the 30% ). I also read on reddit that China has made a layer of graphite that can be applied to solar panels and can generate electricity from the force of rain drops(which sounds super awesome).
This Technology of using the natural evaporation cycle to generate power is just genius to me. Their can be so many applications of this. 
I am making this post because i have a question. This technology is new, just having been invented in 2015. How can i find companies that will use this technology? Just have to wait? Another question would be where to find companies that are going to go public?
