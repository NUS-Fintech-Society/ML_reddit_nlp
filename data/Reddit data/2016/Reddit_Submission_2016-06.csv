(Apologies if I over-paraphrased that exchange)

16-06-01,4m0u31,SEC Provides Guidance On Advertising By Title III Issuers,"The SEC just provided guidance for Title III issuers in the form of Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations.
The SEC has stated in the adopting release that the permitted notices will be similar to “tombstone ads” under Securities Act Rule 134, except that the notices are intended to direct an investor to the intermediary’s platform or funding portal through which the offering is being conducted, such as through a link directing the investor to the platform.
Advertising Restrictions The final rules prohibit an issuer (or person acting on behalf of the issuer) from advertising the terms of the crowdfunding offering, except for limited notices (similar to “tombstone ads” permitted under Securities Act Rule 134) that direct investors to the intermediary’s platform. Information in advertising notices is limited to:

•	a statement that the issuer is conducting a crowdfunding offering, the name of the intermediary through which the offering is being conducted and a link to the intermediary’s platform;

•	the terms of the offering (the amount of securities offered, the nature of the securities, the price of the securities and the closing date of the offering period); and

•	limited factual information about the issuer: the name, address, phone number and website of the issuer; the email address of a representative of the issuer; and a brief description of the issuer’s business. The final rules do not impose limits on how the issuer distributes the advertising notices. For example, an issuer could place notices in newspapers or post notices on social media sites or the issuer’s own website.

In addition, issuers may communicate with investors about the terms of the offering through communication channels provided on the intermediary’s platform, provided an issuer identifies itself as the issuer in all communications. Here is a link to an article on SEC’s Guidance on Advertising By Tittle III Issuers. (https://crowdfundattny.com/2016/05/23/sec-provides-guidance-on-advertising-by-title-iii-issuers/ ). 

As an investor, how do you react to this form of rules? Would these guidelines be of any good to you or would it retard your investment prowess? Let’s hear your take on this issue.

It has a high rate of false-positives and false-negatives, and apparently both negative and positive results still require a follow-up colonoscopy if the patient wants to conclusively know their cancer-status.

It could potentially be successful because colonoscopies are a pain in the ass in more ways than one, but it could be a flop because it's not actually a replacement for colonoscopies.

I think its success will ultimately come down to how it is perceived in the gastroenterologic community.

If anyone knows any gastroenterologists, please ask them what they think about it and report back here.

And if anyone else has any info or sources about how Cologuard is recieved in the medical community, please report back here.

Most of the time all the strikes are way out of the money not what I believe are ""affordable"" or have a good risk/return ratio. HOWEVER, every so often I have come across a strike that is WELL within reason to purchase, but its on a strike that is already in the money with a bid/ask that is slightly over the current market price (I.e. the stock is trading at 4.40; the call option is a 4.00 strike with a bid/ask of ~0.50). Now call me crazy, but why would you NOT purchase an option that cheap that close to the money? I have seen these a few times and want to understand if there is a term or any explanation for these cheap call options.

16-06-01,4m18ot,"Reversed split, what to gain?","So i bought myself in on a company called biolight (BIOL, Nordic MTF, probably not listed for the US market) for the equivelent of a US cent per share. The grand total of the company is 15.5 million shares. The company released today that they would re-brand themselves and change their direction of research and production (from one direction of pharmaceutical equipment to a different one or whatever, not that up to date with the company)
They also stated that they will do a reverse split of their current shares, from 1 share to the value of 100 shares.
Also, the price today has climbed about 60% because of this statement, and a big amount of shares has changed owners.
So, the rumors on some forums claims up to a 1000% gain, and some say it will totally flop.
I have decided to just wait and see, the possible gain is basically to hard to resist, and if the stock plummets, i will just try again next time lol.

I would love to hear your stories or thoughts about going big in a company performing a reversed split, did you win big or lost it all? 
Also, is it even possible to reach 1000% of gain because of a reversed split? Seems a bit too easy imo.
And yeah, its hard to estimate anything if you dont know a smack about the company, but whatever, lets just say its a best case scenario and go from there.

Specifically, I am wondering if there are larger vulnerabilities inherent the characteristics of this asset class that don't get enough attention. ETFs are often presented as an cheaper, more easily traded version of a mutual fund, but if that's the case, why bother with mutual funds at all?

Or could some unlikely confluence of events cause ordinary ETF investors in a plain vanilla ETF, like VTI, to completely lose their shirts while their counterpart mutual fund investors remained whole?

I realize this is totally hypothetical and it may even be a stupid question, but it's something that has been nagging me and my limited financial understanding so I figured I'd ask you Reddit whizkids for some insight.

16-06-01,4m1raw,Question on Roth IRA Maintenance,"There's a chance that I'll exceed income thresholds for a Roth IRA this year. Once this happens, I'd like to think I'm going to stay above these income thresholds. I'm currently 31 with about $39k in my Roth with $3500 already contributed this year. Once it's clear I'm done contributing, what should I do to re-balance the portfolio for the next 30 years? Almost 23k is in FSTVX, about $7500 in QQQ, another $7500 in NYB and the balance with GE. Should I just leave it alone indefinitely once I'm unable to contribute? Should I dump it all into FSTVX? Should I find something else altogether?

Edit: FWIW i have about $161k total across a Rollover IRA, 401k and the Roth. I was able to max out my 401k last year and see no reason why I can't continue to max it out going forward.

$10k in AAPL

I'm 26 and wouldn't mind going very aggressive with some of the money. On the other hand, I would look at bonds or other low risk investments that I don't need to worry about. That said, if I can't beat 3.75% it would make more sense to pay down the mortgage.

16-06-01,4m2brr,"How deferred revenue affects earnings, specific example below.","Go easy, I am new to trading.

This is in regards to SKIS(peak resorts). 

Their season pass sales account for around 30% of their yearly revenue. This March they released their Peak Pass, a season pass that is good for all of their resorts(similar to the Epic pass by Vail Resorts(MTN)). This has boosted season pass sales up 30% from the same period last year.

March 2016 is included in Q4 FY2016. My understanding is that deferred revenue is a liability until it is recognized ratably next season. Will the larger then average season pass sales in March result in lower earnings for Q4 FY2016 then?

Is the relationship between deferred revenue and earnings an important thing to consider or is their a better method for reviewing companies with large %'s of deferred revenue?

The date has been pushed back on from April 4^th. FDA wanted to review more new info with the extra 3 months time. The injectable version of Relistor was approved by the FDA in 2014. Relistor is a Subcutaneous Injection for chronic pain. It is a opioid medication so that might be a turn off the some people. Or a turn on to you fuckers so that you can play $PGNX and once people get hooked on opioids they will need $TTNP's implant. 

Now to the business side of things. $PGNX will get a 50 million milestone payment if Oral Relistor is aproved. Based on the numbers(50 million milestone payment and new revenue from Oral Relistor and growing royalties payed form Reilstor) the company has a shot to turn a profit by the end of this year. Now if have yet to mention how $VRX plays a role in all of this. $VRX has acquired Salix who ran the inventory for Relistor. There has been multiple issue with the inventory and $PGNX has not been getting the royalties it should have due to this. Now with $VRX controlling inventories the royalties should increase by a good amount. Relistor's prescription rate is growing at a rate of 36% Y/Y.

* Gold extraction yield is above average gold mining operations so far (average is around 1.5g/ton, theirs is close to 3g/t with nearly 90% recovery rate)

* Licensing has been successful and indefinitely renewable

* Largest private company in Liberia, give them political advantage in bargaining.

* Recent decision to proceed with operation using newly arrived equipment that will significantly increase operation capacity.

* Finally taking consulting services seriously

* Announcement today of successful debt repayment deferral from creditors. Suggests **management sees profits to be made** (insider motivation) and want to fight to make something out of what they see as a lot of potential

* So far management being able to negotiate buyers of gold at near market average price.

Suppose that:

 1) you believe that the market is due for a bad run broadly, a global recession; and

I am aware not all plans allow a loan for no reason, and that the term and interest rate vary.  But suppose you could get a 2-year loan and you anticipated a bear market for the entire 2-years.

I currently hold:

Does anyone know of any 3D printing stocks or cannabis testing stocks that have promise for the future? I am predicting those industries will become much larger as time progresses; specifically  3D printing.

If you have other suggestions to me as an investor or simply have some stock picks you want to throw out there, please do by all means! All I ask is you provide reasoning to support your conclusions!

Right now, JAGLX is way down for the year, following the rest of the health care sector, but FSMEX is still performing well even in a down market for health care.

16-06-02,4m5awg,Is George Soros Shorting Gold?,"It looks as if George Soros is getting ready to short gold; or rather gold-based equities.

Gold bugs became excited in March, when Soros purchased 1.05 million shares of the SPDR Gold Trust exchange-traded fund (NYSE: GLD); and $264 million worth of the ailing Canadian miner Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE: ABX). Naturally, the gold bulls view Soros’ latest action as proof of the intrinsic value of their favorite metal.

Actually Soros’ interest in gold disproves their thesis. Soros is a speculator who specializes in shorts; he became a legend for shorting the British pound. The most likely explanation for George’s renewed interest in gold; is that he’s spotted another class of equities he can short.

The evidence to prove this thesis is right before our eyes; if we want to look. Soros did not actually buy gold – he bought gold-based or gold-related equities.

The SPDR Gold Trust; or SPDR Gold Shares, is an exchange-traded fund that owns options on gold held in vaults around London. Barrick is simply a mining company that specializes in digging up gold.

Neither of those equities is an investment in actual physical gold. Instead they are simply shares; that Soros can sell any time he wants at the press of a button.

16-06-01,4m40nb,What makes a stock go up?,"Hello my dear friends. I tried to sign up with the username ""stocknoob"", but it was taken, which makes me feel a little bit better in regards to this novice question I'm about to ask.

So, what makes a stock go up? I recently started working for a company that recently (&lt; 1 year) got listed on the stock market. Since I work for this company and have some insight into what they plan on doing in the coming one to three years, I *think* it will go up even more, and so I invested a little bit of money.

Now, I only base this positive prediction on the fact that the company will probably earn more money with the coming strategic advancements, but is that relevant information? Is it only based on earnings? Instinctively, I feel like the price of a stock should reflect how well a company is doing, but it all seems like gambling form the outside, and that is very confusing. If the stock just reflected how well the company did, it would be less of a gamble, a noob might think, to predict the future, no?

So in reality, what makes the stock go up? Does my information have any value or is it just *maybe*, if I'm lucky, relevant to the future stock value?",11

16-06-02,4m6cns,"Bond ETFs, help me understand this :P","Okay, so.

I've gotten a grasp of everything so far. But I want to balance out my portfolio just a little more with Bond ETFS (Probably gonna go with BND for this one).

If I understand this correctly, say I buy 20 shares BND valued at $100 per share. This equates to $2,000 as an initial value.

As I hold these bonds, I get paid monthly due to on-going maturity.

Similarly, as interest rates rise, the ETFs prices will fall and vice versa.

Here's the thing I don't understand. Using the example above, let's say the bond's price went down to $90. And if I sell my 20 shares, I sell it for $1,800. This means I get a $200 loss in total.

So basically my principal payment is entirely dependent on the ETF's price.

Am I understanding this correctly?",42

It dropped to 8-10 after negative advisory committee votes in April, but had since recovered to 16-23.  It's PDUFA date was 05/26, although this was delayed without a specified new date. Today's plunge was attributed to new FDA guidance regarding compassionate use, although this was not specific to SRPT.  

https://www.sarepta.com/our-pipeline.  Currently, DMD treatments were their best hope, and approval is very unlikely.  It seems like they will lose out even if the drug is not outright denied.  

I've got a few questions if anyone can answer:

1. Based on their financials, how soon (also how much) will they need to raise extra cash and how much of an effect will it have on the share price.  https://www.google.com/financeq=NASDAQ%3ASRPT&amp;fstype=ii&amp;ei=fotQV_m5M4qmebv7jcgD.  
2. Based on both financials and pipeline, is it likely that the company will eventually fail if this drug is not approved?
3. The stock recovered a good amount after the advisory committee votes.  However it did so because of the impending PDUFA date (and also possibly due to the shorts).  Can we expect a decent recovery in the coming days/weeks?  I'm assuming that the FDA has to announce a new date before any new decisions/announcements are made.

Overview of what is expected in the news:

""We look forward to presenting data at ASCO from our pivotal NEMO trial of binimetinib in NRAS-mutant melanoma, which met its primary endpoint of progression free survival (PFS), and plan to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) for binimetinib next month,"" said Ron Squarer, Chief Executive Officer of Array BioPharma. ""Importantly, in the pre-specified sub-group of patients who received prior treatment with immunotherapy, including ipilimumab and nivolumab, median PFS was 5.5 months for patients treated with binimetinib compared to 1.6 months for patients treated with dacarbazine. These results are encouraging given the limited treatment options available to patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma beyond immunotherapy.""

""We are also pleased to share results from our Phase 2 trial of encorafenib and cetuximab containing-regimens in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer patients who have progressed after one or more prior therapies,"" added Mr. Squarer. ""Data from this study suggest that median overall survival (OS) for these patients may exceed one year which is substantial when compared to historical published benchmarks for this population, which range between four to six months. We expect to present updated OS data from this trial at ASCO and plan to initiate a global Phase 3 trial in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer later this year.""",58

After India -&gt; Bangladesh, Nigeria, rest of Africa.

Has anyone had any experience with a Datawind tablet or smartphone? Prior editions weren't so nice, but looks like specs have improved significantly. 

The company trades for $30m. Be careful of $13m debt at 17% interest rate. It should be profitable when results are announced for Q1 2016.

16-06-02,4m8r07,Opinions on my beginners(!) portfolio please.,"Hi fellow redditors,

I'm a 19 y/o student without any debts, that wants to assemble a good portfolio that requires relatively low maintenance. After some research I decided to go with investing in ETF's. 
I understand it's a very amateuristic way of displaying my portfolio and the terms I use are probably stupid, but I only bought my ETF's a week or two ago. 
I would invest more money, as I still have some left in my account. But I just want to get used to trading before doing so. 
The options in my portfolio right now I bought mostly because of the, in my opinion, promising underlying fundamentals of the sector's of the ETF's alongside some basic technical analysis. 

Opinions are extremely welcome :).

16-06-02,4m8u3k,Index funds and high net worth investing,"Hi /r/Investing,

I was recently reading a few articles about index investing when I came across this one: http://beginnersinvest.about.com/cs/mutualfunds1/a/071003a.htm

Basically the author laid out, in my opinion, a very eloquent overview of investing in index funds, the strengths and the weaknesses. Everything I had heard before, until I came to this section, which is worth quoting in full:

&gt; Another potentially devastating issue with certain index funds that nobody wants to talk about, and even if they do, refuse to believe the same way folks ignored the dangers of dot-com stocks and collateralized debt obligations, is the risk of **embedded capital gains**.  I've written about this before, too, but it's one of those topics that investors don't want to discuss.  It is outright stupid - that's precisely the word for it no matter who doesn't want to hear it - for a rich investor to buy a meaningful amount of something like the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 index fund in a fully taxable account.  With a relatively insignificant amount of work, he or she could build the index directly out of individual stocks and avoid the risk of being stuck with enormous potential tax liabilities that arise because of the way the tax code treats past unrealized gains in a fund.

&gt;Specifically, Vanguard has $198,712,172,000 in that particular fund as of the end of 2014, of which $89,234,130,000 consisted of unrealized gains.  If Vanguard were to experience a significant run on the fund for whatever reason - and these things have, do, and will happen - management could be forced to liquidate those positions or, at the very best, pay them out ""in kind"".  This is something Vanguard investors have never had to consider because as indexing has become the latest fashion, it has been able to pay redemption requests with fresh deposits a lot of times, net assets growing in the long-run.  Should that stop, it could get ugly.

&gt; Many people won't have to worry about it because they own this fund in their 401(k), Roth IRA, or other tax-shelter.  But if you have even a couple of million of dollars invested in it outside of the confines of such protection, you're behaving like a fool.  No matter how much you may dislike me for bringing it to your attention, it doesn't change the facts.  With a tiny bit of effort, you could eliminate the possibility entirely and yet you choose not to out of laziness, stubbornness, or a lack of understanding.  If you or your heirs someday suffer significant tax losses from these index funds, you'll have no one to blame but yourself.  There isn't even a major convenience advantage, anymore; not at that size.  You're just obstinate, clinging to something you don't understand.

Here's the thing: I'm a high net worth person with millions in taxable accounts, like what he's mentioning in this article. I was a successful entrepreneur over the past five years, and have around $2.1 million across Vanguard index funds, specifically 55% across $VV, $VO, $VB (ie: US large/mid/small cap) and 35% across $VEA, $VSS, and $VWO (ie: Intl developed, small cap, and emerging). I also have some in bonds and p2p, though I'm only 35 and readily employed, so stocks are really the focus at this time.

I don't want this to devolve into critique of my allocation, which is why I'm only giving rough approximations for each fund. I've worked with multiple advisors to get the correct risk/reward/rebalancing levels for my tolerance and life situation.

Instead, my worry is more around the critiques of index investing as covered within the article, namely the risk of embedded capital gains, and why it's ""stupid"" for a wealthy investor like myself to have millions of dollars in taxable index funds.

As the author states, ""With a tiny bit of effort, you could eliminate the possibility [of embedded cap gains] entirely."" However, this effort is not tiny in the least! Buying up each individual fund would be highly tedious. Not only would I amass lots of dollars in trades, be swamped in annual mailers, etc, but I would also have to track the numerous funds in each sector and be buying in and out of these funds each year when I rebalance. Vanguard's US small cap index alone has over 1400 funds. No thanks.

Is the author totally off base here, or am I? Surely we can't both be right. Am I truly being stupid by having $2M in index funds?

Should I be having my taxable accounts managed by a third party, not as emotional protection of me selling off during market drawdowns, but as a way to own the actual individual funds and avoid the dangers of embedded cap gains?

Perhaps there's something I'm missing.

Thanks in advance,
Beryl",1

16-06-03,4mawmm,XBiotech,"[XBiotech: XBIT](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:XBIT) 

This company looks through people's blood for rare natural antibodies that can fight off conditions. They've found a few and used them to run a [bunch of clinical trials](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=xbiotech&amp;Search=Search). 


The most promising of them focus on:

One.) [PHASE 3] Xilonix for Stage 4 Colorectal Cancer; and

Two.) [PHASE 1/2] 514G3 Antibody for MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus)

~

So this company has identified an antibody, *Xilonix*, that interferes with Interleukin 1-Alpha, a protein that helps cells grow and build out their vascular network. Xilonix has been shown to slow down cancer growth in stage 4 colorectal cancer (there is no stage 5).

They are presenting their European phase 3 data on Xilonix on July 2nd at the European Society of Medical Oncology's World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer. (It also has a separate Xilonix phase 3 trial running in the U.S. under the FDA's Fast Track Designation.)

Here's the conference agenda: [A pivotal phase 3 Trial of MABp1 in advanced colorectal cancer
Tamas Hickish, et al., O-027](http://worldgicancer.com/WCGI/WGIC2016/agenda.asp)

The bar for success is very low here, and it appears as though they will knock this out of the park. Patient's who are being treated for stage 4 colorectal cancer are in a bad way, they generally do not have long to live. The only drug Xilonix will be competing with is Bayer's [Regorafenib, which extends overall survival of of patients from 5 months to 6.4 months](http://www.cancernetwork.com/oncology-journal/colorectal-cancer-how-emerging-molecular-understanding-affects-treatment-decisions).


~

XBIT's CEO is super positive with regard to the study and is looking for a smash hit with Xilonix.

They were granted **accelerated review status** for Xilonix by the European Medicines Agency and could gain approval [""as early as fourth quarter 2016.""](http://investors.xbiotech.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=253990&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=2169277)

They've also stated that this same antibody could work for other cancers. “In addition to advanced colorectal cancer, we have seen evidence of activity in other cancer tumor types and firmly believe that anti-IL-1-alpha therapy could be relevant in a broad range of malignancies.”

~

They've also begun building a manufacturing facility capable of producing ~900,000 doses per year, due to open in the third quarter 2016.

~

In the last month they also picked up some *huge* names:

Amgen veteran [Scott Whitehurst](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-whitehurst-6831021) as Chief Financial Officer;

Industry veteran [Dawn McCollough](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-mccollough-285a734) as Vice President of Clinical Operations.

These two were, respectively, on board for Amgen's and Biogen's climbs from relatively smaller companies into the giants that they are today.

~

Amazingly, XBIT ran into a snag in this trial back in November and it hurt their share price ALOT. Some people were not able to stay in the trial, but they were left with over 300 participants. XBIT IPO'd in April 2015 at $26, fell all the way to $8, and has started to climb back to the current share price of $17. 

This presents the opportunity to grab this puppy before they absolutely skyrocket over the next year - if they do.

-

On top of all this they continue to search through blood donors for rare naturally occurring antibodies that will fight other conditions/diseases: [Clostridium difficile](http://www.4-traders.com/XBIOTECH-INC-20708500/news/XBiotech-Identifies-Positive-Donors-for-Anti-Clostridium-difficile-Therapeutic-Antibody-Only-Two-Wee-21390470/?utm_source=seekingalpha&amp;utm_medium=exch&amp;utm_campaign=2015&amp;source=sa).

* How old are you?
* Are you employed/making income? How much?
* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)
* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)
* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
* Any big debts?
* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.

16-06-03,4mck6w,MBRX IPO date was yesterday June 2.,"I am posting this from my phone so this will not have a bunch of links, and I can fix this when I get home. MRBX was listed yesterday and was offered for $6 a share. It opened at $9 and eventually settled to $8 for the day. 

I have read a couple of articles and the general consensus seems to be that their cancer drugs are better than CPXX.  I do not see any current analyst recommendations. They are not on the almighty calendar even though they have two drugs, I know at least one, in the pipeline currently in phase II.  I'm kinda tempted to throw in for 100 shares since bio is hot right now, but a lot of this bios seem to crash soon after after their IPO date. This was only a 10 minute analysis before work, so this is super condensed.

Anyone want to share any thoughts? Go fuck yourselves are welcome.

16-06-03,4med4s,"Questions about longer bond ETF durations, treasuries, and modern portfolio theory","My first question: for two bond funds like BND and BLV, is it true that they behave very similarly, except the longer duration one is more volatile and risky, but therefore generally has better returns over time? If so, would it be worth substituting BLV for BND in an 80/20 portfolio if your time horizon is far enough?


My second question more relates to modern portfolio theory and is based around the idea that US Treasury bonds perform best during stock crashes, and you can rebalance annually to reduce your risk. I backtested a 70 US stocks / 30 long duration treasuries portfolio, and it offers roughly the same returns as 100% stocks, but with significantly less risk. It also beats 90/10 total bonds, and 70/30 total bonds. https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation?s=y&amp;mode=2&amp;startYear=1972&amp;endYear=2015&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=1000&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;benchmark=%5ESPXTR&amp;portfolio1=Custom&amp;portfolio2=Custom&amp;portfolio3=Custom&amp;TotalStockMarket1=70&amp;TotalStockMarket2=70&amp;TotalStockMarket3=90&amp;TotalBond2=30&amp;TotalBond3=10&amp;LongTermBond1=30

The video sucks balls but got me thinking about solar energy companies on the rise, thoughts? Or has anyone seen this scam from Lombardi Financial?

16-06-03,4mdv1w,"When looking at REITs, should one ignore P/E ratio in favor of yield?","Please critique the following reasoning if you know better.

After much thought I've come to the conclusion that when looking at REITs, the P/E ratio is not a good measure of ""how relatively expensive "" the stock price is; rather one should look at the yield.

Take Digital Realty REIT (@DLR) for example:

Price | P/E | Yield
:--|:--|:--
$98.05|94.88|$3.52 (3.69%)

A P/E close to 100 seems overly extended when the average SP500 is currently at 24.25. However DLR's current yield of 3.69% is pretty average for a REIT.

Let's suppose the stock is extended and so it should revert to the mean, i.e. to a PE of 24.25. So the stock price would have to shrink by a factor of 94.88/24.25=3.9 and be $25.14

Then a $3.52 yield pro-rated to a stock price of $25.14 is a 14% yield. 

That's right, a 14% yield! Not gonna happen without massive buy and stock price shooting back up.

**So to summarize:** Yield as a percentage changes as REIT stock prices fluctuate. Since REITs yield a proportion of profitability, **percentage yield** is a better metric to assess relative cost of a REIT share rather than P/E. ",9

16-06-04,4mgi99,Rate my trading stategy,"Hi stock community,

I am looking for feedback on the strategy I am planning on implementing. This strategy seems common from reading online and much of the plan is from a short book I read. I do not know anyone in real life that trades options. I therefore have no one to review my trades or bounce ideas off. 
 
Investment goals: To return a decent return on investment on a neutral to bullish market. 
Level of risk: Medium?
Capital investment up to $5,000 with view to invest additional funds if successful. 
Plan: Buy, to open, long dated deep in the money calls (LEAPS) on relatively stable stocks or buy physical shares of a stock. Sell to open short term (6-8 week) calls against either the long dated calls or shares. The idea is for the selling of covered calls to generate consistent income over time while minimising risk and market speculation. 
 
My initial thoughts: If I write calls against LEAPS I will have the same market exposure as if I were to buy stocks but with minimised risk. However, I will not collect dividends. Also, I feel this is a bit more complicated than simply buy shares and writing calls every 1-2 months against them. I am mostly concerned about doing myself un-done if I have not thought of something and end up owing money somehow?
 
Here's the plan applied to a stock called ASX (An Australian stock). Basic info of the stock: Current price $45.82 (Mkt cap $8.87B, Div Y4.24%, old stable business, annual ROE 10.94%, zero net debt, av. 3 year net income $376 million).
 
Buy to open 29/06/2017 $40.00 ASX call (deep in the money) for $6.49 X 2 X 100 = $1298.

After adding $35 for borkerage = $1333

Write to open 28/07/16 $46.60 ASX call (near the money) for $1.00 X 2 X 100 = $200.

After subtracting $35 for brokerage = $165

% ROI = 12% in 7 weeks

% Return on exposure = 165/9164 = 1.8 % in 7 weeks
 
If the value goes up in 7 weeks but does not go beyond ~46.50 then I will rewrite another short term option (best case scenario). If the money rises above this level short term, I will be forced to either sell my call to cover the call I wrote, or exercise the long dated call? If this happens I still keep the premium but I will neither lose or gain additional money? If the stock drops then the option I bought would be worth less, but once the option I sold expires I am free to write another option again. If say, the stock price drops to $42, then I could still safely write short dated calls for approx $42.50 because I am still able to cover this with my options? If exercised I would have lost money because the premium of the LEAPS I initially bought would have decreased. If the price drops below $40 then my call will be worth next to nothing and I could no longer write covered calls against it. This would be the worst case scenario? Ie. Lose $1333 - $165 = $1168 lost.
 
Is what I said true? Have I left something out or misunderstood anything? Please evaluate. Should I stick to writing covered calls of physical shares until I am more experienced?

ASSETS

* $11,000 emergency fund

* Couple grand farting around in my checking account but that's for expenses and crap.

* $500 a month into Roth IRA

* $2,600 in Lending Club (not stock) That I will be trying to pull out of as the loans get paid back. I'm basically am using it as a riskier 3-5 year CD only the rates are a lot better.  

We want to own a house someday soon and I know we should be saving for that but I feel like by the time I get around to making payments on that I wont have enough to do much investing. 

I have a list of dividend yielding stocks that are large trusted companies (think KO, WMT, MO, PSX, IBM, F) and I want to invest directly into a diversified list of companies like that. Should I be more focused on an ETF like VIG or SDY and just leave it and not think about it? 

How much should I have in order to make it worth buying specific stocks directly? Am I too young to be worried about this and should I just keep saving and putting away for retirement?

Should I buy a house,pay it off, then invest when I am 50?

Should I live in our car with our dog and eat ramen 3 times a day and put every dime into AAPL chanting ""This will be worth it, this will be worth it"" as my wife sobs uncontrollably?

Most people will just throw money into a three or four fund portfolio, or pick some blue chip stocks and be done with it.

There's also active management, such as what Fidelity offers. They'll trade your portfolio based on your risk profile and charge 1% on top of the expense ratio of whatever funds there are. Their minimum balance is $50k. 

It's been commonly said that active managers don't tend to beat index funds in the long run, but I don't know if that's assuming that the active managers are not *actively* managing small balances (versus managing the portfolios for the very wealthy).

16-06-03,4mf18r,"Tell Me If I'm Making Sense Here","So I've been studying the $AMC / $CKEC merger a lot (roughly 15% of my portfolio is AMC) and I'm really starting to think I should dump AMC for Carmike. As you know if you follow either stock, AMC has offered $30/share to CKEC, which many Carmike shareholders think is incredibly undervaluing the company. Carmike has accepted pending a shareholder vote at the end of this month. Two major holders, Mittleman Brothers and Driehaus Capital, own about 18% of the shares and are moving to block the merger at the $30 and push for something closer to $45. The shares, as the bot noted below, of both company are just under $30, with both seeing a significant jump after the merger announcement. I haven't seen many cases where the acquiring company gets that big of a boost from a buyout that is paying a 20% premium on share price. 

Morningstar indicates that the top 10 institutional shareholders hold 55% of the outstanding shares. The top two being Mittleman and Driehaus, followed by Fidelity Institutional, which picked up 1.82 million shares as of March 31 if I am reading the report correctly. At the market price in that time frame, I can't imagine why they would have scooped it up to essentially take a loss or a wash on their money unless they planned to vote against the acquisition @ $30 and push for more. If I do this for the 4th and 6th largest institutional holders (skipping the 5th because they added to positions recently, rather than opening it), that makes up 35.56% of shares outstanding. I'm relatively new to Morningstar and investing, so I won't include ""funds"" because I'm not sure if they overlap with institutions, but I find this to be very interesting. 

Insider shareholding accounts for merely 3.31% of outstanding shares, which are likely all going to vote in favor of the merger. So, assuming the new positions vote for more money (I can't think why else they would buy at such a slim margin, honestly), the math looks something like this:

100% shares - 3.31% voting yes = 96.69% in play
Lets ideal world this and say the aforementioned 35.56% vote no, or at least substantially all vote no. 

That leaves 61.14% of outstanding shares, 14.45% of which would need to vote no to block the merger at a higher price. I like those odds, given the amount of scrutiny that the merger has taken since it was announced. Of course, the obvious drawback is the merger falling through altogether, but I don't believe that would happen until the $45+ price range. 

Someone critique this and tell me where I went wrong and in what ways my thinking is flawed.",12

However, I had a few very basic level questions that I suspect will just cause me to smack myself in the head with my palm when they're answered. Thank you in advance:

1. To determine, hypothetically, what investors currently think the July 2016 fed funds rate will be, one would take the difference between the current July 2016 contract price and the current fed funds rate. However, given that I could buy contracts at a wide variety of strike prices, how could I exactly say what THE ""current July 2016 contract price is""? Is it just the strike price with the most open interest? Is it the ""settlement price""? If the latter, what the hell does that actually *mean*? is it just an average of the high and low for the day?

2. I get directional trades with options; if I'm bullish on AAPL, I buy calls at a strike price that isn't too expensive premium wise but where I still think I can turn a good profit as the stock price rises. I do the same for puts if I'm bearish. But let's say I think the fed is going to raise rates by 25 bp by December. What do I actually go out and buy or sell to attempt to profit from my conviction? Is there any other reason people buy these futures? Is it just purely speculative?",1

The subscription is also a concern, because of all the free news sources on the internet, including free articles on WSJ.com.

http://abstracts.asco.org/176/AbstView_176_164307.html
Methods: Patients &gt; 18 yrs with 1st relapse GBM received either 250 mg/m2 (21) or 350 mg/m2(7) every 21 days until tumor progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal. Tumors were assessed every 6 weeks by MRI and in some instances Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast (DSC) MRI. Safety monitoring included serum chemistries and CBC prior to each infusion and echocardiograms every 2 molnths. Results: Median age was 56 yrs (28-73); 19 females and 9 males. Subjects received 1-20 cycles of treatment. Median drug exposure for the 250 mg/m2dose is 1042 mg/m2 D equivalents (Deq) (range 371-5768 mg/m2 Deq) and for the 350 mg/m2 dose is 1912 mg/m2 Deq (range 472-3647 mg/m2Deq). Best responses in 21 subjects according to MRI were 3 PR, 7 SD and 11 PD. Median overall survival has not been reached (range is 0.5-17.3+ months) with median f/u of 7 months (1-17+ months). Major grade 3 or 4 AEs include neutropenia (6 subjects) febrile neutropenia (2 subjects) mucositis (2 subjects), thrombocytopenia (2 subjects) and anemia (2 subjects). 2 subjects experienced treatment-related SAEs. No subjects had a decrease in their LVEF below 50% of expected values.Two subjects with apparent PD by scan underwent tumor debulking and had no microscopic evidence of disease. Another subject demonstrated no active malignancy upon DSC MRI scanning. Conclusions: Unlike doxorubicin, Aldoxorubicin appears to penetrate the blood-brain barrier in humans and is associated with objective tumor responses, stable disease and prolonged survival. Pseudoprogression occurs and may confuse responsiveness to A. Clinical trial information: NCT02014844

So what does /r/stocks think? Continue lowering my avg. cost? Sell now and buy below $10?

BUT, I have some major concerns with TSLA's ability to deliver its hype on the new Model 3 as well as just production demand in general. Especially the new ""giga factory"" that is set to finish last this year (sp?). I do a lot of work in the manufacturing industry and can (from first hand experience) state that MOST large scale projects (like opening an ENTIRE new production facility) go months some times years behind schedule. The complexity of their new product is going to put demands on every company TSLA touches and just by experience I believe there will be setbacks. I believe that this factory is already priced into the current stock price and that inevitably the delays will move the price down. Anybody else feel this way? I am not even addressing the demand for batteries and raw materials behind it. I think there is a lot that needs to be resolved in order for them to ""really deliver"" what they have promised.

According to the previous link, currently $SPY is trading at $210.28, and the price per option is $0.65. The total cost would be $65. 

On the otherhand, $SPXS, the 3x inverse of S&amp;P 500, is trading at $14.25 per share. $65 invested would be 4.561 shares.

According to the call calculator, if the price of $SPY went to $231.00 (unlikely but for the sake of argument), I would profit $1,935 from the option. It would increase by an amount of 9.85%; so $SPXS would decrease by 29.56%, and the share price would be $10.04.

So my net profit would be approximately $1,889. Another example would be in the price went to other way to $190.50; my profit would only be $18.33 but a profit nevertheless.

Planning on a slow round the world trip maybe 5+ years. So limited access and time to markets and investing. We have about $2MM, $600k in IRA’s (rolled over from 401k's) and the rest in a brokerage account (all in TRowe). We have lived in the US for the last 20 years, prior to that the UK for 10 years and before that in South Africa.

My financial plan says I need to make 4% a year. I would like to make more but at the same time don’t want to be greedy and lose our retirement pot in the event of a market meltdown. 

Should I just put everything in some target date retirement Mutual Funds and be happy with that or pay somebody to manage it for me and maybe beat the 4%. I am good with some risk - I have invested steadily over the years holding in bad times and using market dips/crashes as good buying opportunities - I just don’t want to ruin our retirement plans.

I need to first clear any questions with regard to my ability to accurately discuss these points. I did grow up around money, I've found people here immediately assume that makes me a bog standard trust fund baby and I can understand the enmity to a point; it's common. I just picked this stuff up from as far back as I remember. We never talked about money. Ever. So naturally I was fascinated - Hence my eventual career choice. Tertiary education: I read at Exeter College. Planning my masters for next year, in economics or political science - unsettled.
Current position: I work for a large financial firm on a contract due to expire later this year. I'm a trader but part of what I do involved investment appraisal. It's absolutely not my intention to come across as elitist in any way but I think you'll agree that gives me a bit more credibility than some of the armchair investing cretins that crop up in this sub like bloody Cholera.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Now that the necessary rubbish is out the way: I've seen far too many threads from people who genuinely just want good advice, from experienced people, only to get commentary such as this:
&gt; most index funds outperform actively managed funds     
&gt; There are countless examples of actively managed accounts under-performing.

This blows me away because it highlights just how rampant confirmation bias is in this age of everyman-knows-best online investment advice. The statistics people will cite say things such as ""the *average* active fund doesn't do as well as a passive"", 401k, to use an example from across the pond. If you want to play the average game then you can make any number of arguments against the idea of active management. The fact remains if you treat your chosen ETF as a passive you **are obviously going to be exposed to this rule of average success.** For christ's sake get this in the noggin: The world of investing behaves just as any other market, there is money to be made. WHICH MEANS there are *obviously* positive and negative forces! So there's no point whatsoever in paying attention to the statistics argument - you need to choose the fund which is the right fit for you and make that bet. Nobody can promise consistent, high returns - if they could there'd be no competition in the money management industry. I apologize if this seems childishly blatant to you but this obviously still has to be said. People are **still** recommending 401k, Vanguard and any number of potentially ill-fitting and subsequently valueless alternatives because they are clearly clueless.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
I'll move onto my final point. There seems to be some bizarre perception that traders - that is to say money managers of the sort we're discussing - sit about following the S&amp;P like we're Alsatians it's a fucking Wagyu Tenderloin. I can't fathom where this idea came from but if you've even got your brain in Neutral you should have worked out there's a bit more to active management. Every single day considerations are made with regard to sector exposure, our DIR/INDIR hedge risk balances, fixed income (bond)-equity-commodity ratios with regard to risk climate, overall global macroeconomic  tendency, our running leverage risk models which are weighted for historical and projected T/M/D/ID volatility levels. Please don't listen to these fruity ideas some of you seem to have about how trading is ""basically index shadowing"" or ""fund managers go long on anything that'll stand still long enough to get its arse slapped"". We don't slouch into the office, spunk off a bit, buy 50m in bluechip then spend the rest of the day snorting baking soda off the steering wheels of our Quattroportes, pop home for a champagne brunch with Piers Morgan then round the day off with a spot of tramp-hunting.

So I think jobs weak -&gt; the treasury has lower income stream -&gt; gov lowers yields on t-bills

then i think existing bond funds rise because the existing holdings of older notes which have the old higher yield .

However in the long term its bad for bunds because eventually the bonds will mature and the fund has to acquire bonds at the new lower rate.

Just wondering if anyone has done some research into companies likely to benefit from the automating of vehicles and transport services.

I also would recommend looking at MATX, they're a big player in international shipping with several near-monopolies and competitive advantages in the Asia to US market. Though that exposes them to other sector risks as well.

I personally think this industry is due for huge growth in the long term as we continue to overfish our oceans.  The US is the top importer in fish and is currently producing more while current fisheries are being depleted or being restricted in access.

I'm aware that currently there is a large sector in China and northern europe but am unsure which companies are active in the US or on us markets. Google hasn't given me many results, but perhaps I'm just searching wrong? Any help would be appreciated.


I see there's MHG and GSF online but would prefer US options. Furthermore, because this is an el nino year the seas in the pacific are warmer, which hurts fisheries. This could be a good buy for a few month or years' turn around as costs will be higher if this has had an effect.",15

While the guy is a little heavy leaning on the upcoming financial panic talk, he makes some good points for owning 10% of your portfolio in physical gold.  

Here are a few points I found interesting.  Read as many or as little as you like.  I don't give a shit... GFY either way (All credit to the author, let me know if this breaks any rules and I'll put it in my own words)-

* ""Investors in GLD take other risks besides not having physical gold and being targets of digital hacking.  For example, officials could close the NYSE, leaving investors unable to trade shares.  Those who say it will never happen should recall that it happened due to a software glitch on July 8th, 2015, during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and after 9/11.""

* ""Digital wealth is subject to power outages, infrastructure and exchange collapses, hackers, and online theft.  What good is a billion dollar portfolio if it can be wiped out overnight? What if the government shuts down banks and reprograms ATMs to limit you to $300 a day for gas and groceries?  This exact scenario played out in Cyprus in 2013 and Greece in 2015.""

* ""It is also interesting to note that the amount of gold held by the Treasury, about eight thousand tons, is roughly equivalent, to the amount of gold claimed by the Fed on it's balance sheet; also eight thousand tons...Is this because the Treasury if afraid to hold less gold than it theoretically owes to the Fed? Is eight thousand tons a floor on the US gold hoard because that's how much the fed claims on it's balance sheet? If o, that relationship is highly significant because it means the US cannot dump any more physical gold on the market.""

* ""My advice is for private gold storage companies, not bank storage.  The reason is that banks are heavily regulated, and gold held there can be easily confiscated by the state... Banks may fail and your claim to any gold may get tied up in a court proceeding...You might even get worthless bank shares instead of your original gold."" 

**Last one - here the author claims gold could reach upwards of $10,000 per ounce in the near future.  YOLO.**
* ""The implied price is straightforward.  It's the ratio of paper money to official physical gold in the world...Some assumptions are needed.  For example, which countries will be included in the new gold standard?  What is the proper definition of money supply (m0, M1, M2...)?  What ratio of gold to money will be required to maintain confidence in a new gold-linked system? Gathering the data and making assumptions leads to  a indicative nondeflationary price of $10,000...Other assumptions would produce results as high as $50,000 an ounce""

If you want to gamble with this company and think they're going to shoot back, go for it. A lot of people have lost a lot of money and want this company to soar back to the levels they were at, but you have to realize the company was at that peak *because* it was operating unethically. There's a lot of ""unknown"" about VRX and its dealings and its overall operating performance is not as attractive as something like PFE. Is PFE sexy and in the news every other day? No. But it is stable and has a much more promising future.

16-06-05,4mq288,Detailed questions/advice on portfolio (xpost /r/financialindependence),"Posting here as I was told it might be more appropriate than on /r/financialindependence.

Right now I have a 401k with 36k and a brokerage with 128k, both at vanguard. I also have an HSA account but I haven't hit the minimum to invest yet so I can't see what funds are available, and I am planning on opening an IRA account w/ vanguard (I am over both traditional and roth limits so I plan on doing the roth backdoor). 

- To do the backdoor roth, I need to actually open 2 accounts with vanguard, both the Roth and Traditional, is that how it works?
- Will my IRA will have the same fund choices as my brokerage account?
- In terms of taxes, all my purchases are treated as regular post-tax purchases, and when I'm filing my taxes I simply don't claim the tIRA deduction, is that right?

Now, my current portfolio allocation is following some advice someone gave me a long time ago. I didn't really know what I was doing then but I've been reading financialindependence/boglehead and now I'd like to take control of my own situation. Here is the current allocation:

https://hellomoney.co/portfolio/d040a6-current-allocations

What I would like to do is a 3 fund portfolio (40% intl stock, 40% us stock, 20% bonds - I'm in my late 20s), and it seems recommended for tax efficiency to have bonds in tax-free or tax-deferred accounts, intl stock in the taxable account, and us stock to fill the remainder. Keeping that in mind, would the following allocations look good?

https://hellomoney.co/portfolio/6f025a-ideal-allocations

For the rIRA I would upgrade to the admiral shares once I hit the minimum next year. My 401k choices are the following:

https://i.imgur.com/MnJmRJu.png

Is there anything wrong with this? Is there anything else that would be better? Also to transition from my current to ideal, I would have to sell the current allocations and those would all be taxable events, is that right? Is there some sort of cutoff there or way for me to determine whether it's worth it or not?

This is gonna be kinda long, but I'd really appreciate some advice from people who know more than me.  I just turned 20, and it got me thinking about the performance of my investment account that's managed by my financial adviser since it's been two years since I started it (I opened it on my 18th birthday).

It started with $12,000, and I started using this adviser because, well, my dad told me to.  My dad, and his dad, use my current adviser's father and tell me that he has done very well for them, so my father told me to use his adviser's son.  Sorry if that's a confusing sentence, I'll try to shorten it down.  My adviser is the son of the adviser my dad and grandpa use.

Well, it's been about two years, and I'm at ~$11,300  That's near the highest I've seen it.  I put in 12K at the start, and honestly, I've never seen my account have more than that.  I'm a little bit worried that I'm being taken advantage of, but I don't really have anyone to ask about this.  When I ask my dad, he says I'm being a paranoid smart ass who thinks he's smarter than the professional investor.  He says that the market hasn't been doing well, and I can't freak out whenever I lose a bit of money.  I agree with that, I know the market goes up and down.  My only concern is that I just don't know what I'm paying the guy for because it doesn't seem like he does much.  Let me show you, and it'd mean a lot to get some of your guy's advice since you all seem to know a lot more than I.

Let me give you a basic activity history of my account.  I'd post screen shots, but I don't know if that's safe or not, so I'll just type out a general outline.

* On my 18th birthday, my account is opened with $12,000.  Over the course of a few days, the money was spent on... stuff?  I'm not totally certain, but I'm pretty sure their a bunch of different mutual funds.  Eight of them.
* A week later, my adviser takes out his ""Advisory Inception Fee"" of 25.00.
* No activity is done on my account for a month, but then about two and a half shares are sold of something, coming out to $58.47.  A week later, he takes out a $58.49 advisory fee for himself.
* No activity for two months, and then a large amount of trades are made on the same day, but almost all of them are catagorized as ""Automatic Investment.""
* A month and a half later in January, about two stocks are sold for a total of $58.19, and the next day, he takes a $45.32 service fee.
* There is then ZERO activity in my account for over three months.  At the end of this long period of inactivity, about one share of something is sold for $29.53, and a few days later, and advisory fee of $44.40 is taken out for him.  Two days later, about 5 trades take place.  This was in April.
* So that was April, and then there is no trades or any activity till July.  My adviser sells 2.091 shares of something for $44.86.  Three days later, my adviser takes his advising fees of EXACTLY $44.86.

I could keep going, but you all get the point.  This pattern continues for two years.  A few stocks are sold, he takes a fee, sells and buys a few stocks, does nothing for months, sells two stocks, takes out his fee, buys and sells a few stocks, does nothing for several months, blah blah blah.

Is this common practice?  I just don't know much about this stuff, and the one thing that I can't stand in this world is being taken advantage of and suckered by other people.  Like I said, I'm not worried just because I'm losing money.  It's not that.  What I'm worried about is that I'm *wasting* money and time with this guy.  I feel like these early years of my life are important to start getting a grip on investing, and I don't want to waste them with a guy who only does activity on my account about 4 times a year when it's time for his fees.

What do you guys think?  And again, thank you all in advance.",1

16-06-06,4mqetf,What are your favorite stocks to day trade with? Volatility and small cap welcome 🤑,"After opening up a ustocktrade account and realizing that day trading is the most fun shit in the world I haven't gone long once. I love being able to throw half of my account into something, make 3% in minutes and sell. The potential for gains gives me a nice hard cock from 9:30-4 M-F.

MGT has been a lot of fun to watch and I made some decent gains off of the rise and some since then. Fluctuation and volume have been really solid. Always watching PIRS and made one day trade on it. What stocks have been working for you?

EDIT: Also just a quick PSA, you are able to day trade on ustocktrade as much as you want (no minimum) and they have instant settlement, bid/ask displayed, limit buy/sell, auto buy/sell, simple clean UI (mobile is very nice). $1 a month fee and $1 buy and sell. ",9
16-06-06,4mtis4,A better way to play a pullback this week than long Volatility,"All you bearish dildoes, listen up.  I keep telling you clowns not to go long UVXY/TVIX.  If you are feeling bearish this week or thinking there may be a pullback, a much better trade this week is a put ratio spread on SVXY.  You can get a 64/65 June 10 put ratio spread for a $.75 credit. This is selling 2 $64 puts and buying 1 $65 put.

B/E: SVXY @ 62.25  
Max profit: SVXY @ 64.00 on Friday - $175 (2.8% RoC, not bad for 4 days)  
SVXY goes up/stays flat: You make $75 (1.2% RoC)    
Max Loss: $6,225 because of the uncovered put on SVXY    

If that Max Loss makes you anxious or you don't have cash to secure the put, you can slap a 61/64/65 broken-wing butterfly on this bad boy for a $33 credit.  That is: buy a $61 put, sell 2 $64 puts, and buy one more $65 put.  Max profit is $133, max loss is $167.  POP is 71% on this trade.  If you're wrong on your bearish guess, you still get to keep $25.  B/E is 62.70.

Keep in mind that SVXY should go up this week about 2% if the market stays flat or goes up, so any volatility has a lot of headwind to overcome to significantly push SVXY down.  In other words: even if VIX short term futures go up a couple percent, SVXY should still say flat.  It would take a move of about 10% on the short term futures to bring SVXY below the break evens listed above, so it could be a good play if you are mildly bearish/cautious this week.  A pullback of a couple percent would probably have you hitting your max profit on these trades, assuming vol expectations stay relatively in line with the market movement (which is usually the case for small market moves). 

If you are expecting a crash (as most of this sub seems to be) then by all means keep shorting SVXY and buying UVXY/TVIX. ",10

16-06-06,4mrx8u,Interesting start of this week: Consultancy Firm McKinsey Runs Private Hedge Fund (FT),"Some juicy news on this otherwise boring Monday morning from one of the most widely known consultancy firms worldwide. For three decades, McKinsey has been running a hedge fund in secrecy, McKinsey Investment Office Partners, in which its 1,400 partners invest.

https://next.ft.com/content/7c6700bc-2976-11e6-8b18-91555f2f4fde

Summary:

&gt; Few outside of the consultancy have ever heard of the McKinsey Investment Office, known as MIO Partners, yet it has established an operation as sophisticated as the world’s best resourced hedge funds, employing 80 staff across offices in New York, London, Munich and Singapore.

&gt; McKinsey, which employs more than 9,000 consultants, advises many of the world’s largest companies on strategic questions, including whether to enter into a merger, change their business direction or downsize. This gives McKinsey consultants unique insights into companies and entire industries.

&gt; In SEC filings, MIO says it has created an “information barrier” between itself and McKinsey consultants to ensure no material non-public information ever crosses between the two sides (...) However, the filings also make clear that there is no barrier to MIO’s funds investing in securities that are tied to McKinsey clients.

&gt; However, [MIO's fund manager] warned McKinsey partners that they were more likely to continue earning the 3.5 per cent of annual outperformance MIO had made since 2004, which stripped out his big bets in the past.

16-06-06,4mslcf,The viability of Equity Crowdfunding.,"I have been researching on how equity crowdfunding works in relation to pricing, liquidity, advertising restrictions, marketing expenses and others and how this differ from other types of Fundraising. Through my research, I sought to find out how these differences will affect viability of Equity Crowdfunding.


Equity crowdfunding differs from many other types of financing in that it has no debt component. Tailored to businesses with strong growth potential and the ability to pitch their cases persuasively, this funding comes from a pool of accredited investors via secure online platforms. This phase of the JOBS Act, non-accredited investors will be able to participate in these platforms as well. Rather than having to make payments, the business offers shares of its company in return for funding.


Financed amounts typically range from $50,000 to $1 million, and it takes about three months or more until funds are disbursed. Collateral, personal guarantees and credit checks are generally not required. Instead, investors examine the growth potential of a business idea and the odds that company shares will appreciate over time.
Although you won’t make loan payments, raising capital through an equity crowdfunding platform isn’t free. Most platforms charge between 7% and 12% of funds raised for their services, and additional payment processing fees may also apply.


Offering shares of the business is a novel alternative to taking out a traditional loan.


Even though funds don’t have to be repaid, equity crowdfunding can still be costly. Business owners also need to be sure they’re comfortable parting with company shares and maintaining the required high level of transparency. For start-up business lacking collateral or perfect credit, however, equity crowdfunding offers a terrific opportunity to turn exciting ideas into profitable reality.


Right now equity crowdfunding is in its infancy and will likely experience some growing pains. As regulations and practices evolve, and an even wider pool of investors is permitted to participate, this new way to finance has the potential to offer even greater opportunity to all involved.


On the other side, other forms of Fundraising has its own pros and cons too. it can be a fast way to raise finance with no upfront fees but it will not necessarily be an easier process to go through compared to the more traditional ways of raising finance – not all projects that apply to crowdfunding platforms get onto them. Pitching a project or business through the online platform can be a valuable form of marketing and result in media attention but when you are on your chosen platform, you need to do a lot of work in building up interest before the project launches – significant resources (money and/or time) may be required.


Sharing your idea, you can often get feedback and expert guidance on how to improve it, it is a good way to test the public’s reaction to your product/idea - if people are keen to invest it is a good sign that the your idea could work well in the market. Investors can track your progress - this may help you to promote your brand through their networks, ideas that may not appeal to conventional investors can often get financed more easily.


But, if you don’t reach your funding target, any finance that has been pledged will usually be returned to your investors and you will receive nothing, failed projects risk damage to the reputation of your business and people who have pledged money to you. Also, if you haven’t protected your business idea with a patent or copyright, someone may see it on a crowdfunding site and steal your concept, getting the rewards or returns wrong can mean giving away too much of the business to investors.


My question is “How will these differences affect the viability of Equity Crowdfunding”?

16-06-06,4mumfg,Random walk theory. Why do we invest?,"Recently I read ""Random walk down Wall Street"" and I have some questions to all of you folks. Why do people invest if indexes are more profitable in a long run? Basically, we just waste our time pursuing something which most likely most of the people here will never achieve? Why not instead of spending your time on picking stocks/making decisions invest in an index and make money in other places where it's more realistic?

We have a couple vendors that store their product here as well. There is one who must rent uhaul trailers weekly to carry his product because he was using a friend's van, but his friend moved. So he bought a truck and wants to save up and buy a trailer. He is of good character and the trailer he wants isn't very much ($2400). I offered to buy the trailer in return for something obviously and he is interested, but I am looking for ideas on what to ask for exactly/ how to structure this.

16-06-07,4mwvr6,SIG Signet Jewelers,"Shares have sold off significantly and Jim Grant just issued a negative report on the stock and famed short seller Marc Cohodes is short. Their was also buzz around a news story involving store clerks switching diamonds for lesser quality ones when selling to customers. https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephaniemcneal/women-say-kay-swapped-their-diamonds?utm_term=.cedL9XREk#.muLPkE6np

""You are setting yourself up for a Lumber Liquidators' (LL) scenario where any news show can send in hidden cameras and then the stock gets cut in half,"" Cohodes told Grant's. ""Who is to say that ABC or 60 Minutes doesn't walk into one of these stores with a hidden camera and gets the diamond appraised and the clerk hands it back not as the A-grade stone that the customer actually bought but as Moissanite or as a D-grade diamond instead?""

I believe this story is overblown and the company will take the steps neccesary to improve authenticty of its diamonds. I also believe that this type of situation is one that could be found among all types of jewelery stores and is inevitable. 

Complaints about the company surround its financing arm which seems to be weak.

""In-store credit sales at Signet have risen to 61.5% in fiscal year 2016 from 52.6% in fiscal year 2008. What is troubling about the growth in credit sales, is that the average FICO score in Signet's portfolio is 662, which is only marginally better than the 640 subprime threshold, Grant's report said."" - The Street

I think this presents an opportunity for the company to significantly improve its lending practices or explore a possible sale of the credit business. 

As the largest seller of affordable diamond, gold, and silver jewelry in the United States, and with significant operations in Canada and the United Kingdom, Signet Jewelers (SIG) is steadily consolidating what has traditionally been a fragmented retail segment. Signet operates a number of jewelry brands, including Jared, Kay, and Zales, which it segments by customer buying occasion, attitude, and in-store experience. - Morningstar

Many Hedge Funds in name and they look to be acquiring shares:

Keith Meister has a 8.3% stake.
https://hedgemind.com/stocks/SIG

On June 6th a trader/hedge fund purchased 4788 Jan2017  $95 Call Options for $11 = $5 million bet. 


SIG's revenue (TTM) has risen for more than five consecutive quarters. One year ago the firm reported $6.4 billion in revenue. For the most recent year it reported $6.9 billion (a 6.6% one-year rise). Two-years ago the firm reported annual revenue of $4.5 billion (up 53.7%). 1 year ago Operating Revenues/Operating Expense was 1.14. In the last year we can see operating margins are increasing and have reached 1.16. Net Income (after tax profit) over the trailing twelve months (TTM) for SIG is rising. For the most recent trailing-twelve-months (TTM) the company reported net income of $496 (million). That's an increase in the most recent year from $404 (million) or a 22.90% change.

Levered Free Cash Flow (TTM US$ Millions) is a critical determinant of stock price since market cap is the present value of all future free cash flows. For SIG the metric is falling (it was $-585 million last year). For the most recent trailing-twelve-months the company reported Levered Free Cash Flow (TTM US$ Millions) of $33 million. This cash metric is down $-19 million from $52 million two-years ago. Capital Expenditures (TTM US$ Millions) in the most recent quarter for SIG was $223 million. CapEx is falling (-5.15%) from last year's value of $235 million. Further, CapEx today relative to two-years ago is increasing (41.43%) from last year's value of $158 million. SIG generates $1.16 in revenue for every $1 in expense, which is above the sector average of $1.05. SIG generates $234,000 in revenue per employee which is below the sector average of $338,000.

In the quarter, sales grew 3.9% on a 2.4% increase in comparable-store sales, reaching $1.58 billion. The company opened a net 22 stores to end the quarter at 3,611, but Signet also closed a net 11 stores since the end of the last fiscal year. For 2016, Signet still expects to add 55 to 89 net new locations, which equates to 3.0% to 3.5% square footage growth, and has maintained guidance of 2.0% to 3.5% same-store sales, in line with our annual model. Gross margins ticked up 40 basis points to 38.2%, while selling, general, and administrative expenses improved 50 basis points to 28.8% of revenue, adjusting for one-time items.

Competitive Advantages:

Buyers of Jewlery can purchase on credit. &gt; non-financing jewlerey stores

Buying power in diamonds and other silver

Affordable diamonds segment

Largest jewelry retailer.

Shouldnt be affected by e-commerce as people want to hold, touch, and examine these fine goods. 

Moat:

10% market share

Not much of a moat

Needs to improve margins

The major acquisition of Zales (closed May 2014) is clouding returns on capital and reducing operating margins, although improvement is captured in our forecast. If successful, the integration and improvement of the combined operations will strengthen the scale advantages of Signet as a whole. Although Signet was already large enough to achieve scale advantages, the acquisition ensures that no new competitor can use Zales to approach Signet's size and sales levels. - Morningstar

As I got older, my plan was to fill up the first 10% of my 30% bond allocation using a long term bond fund.  The next 10% would be filled using an intermediate term fund, and the final 10% a short term bond fund.  The logic being the the risk of the marginal bond being added is lower and lower.
Does this sound like a sensible strategy?  I ask because I am reading through Swensen's 'Unconventional Investor' and he advises a 30% allocation split between Treasury Bonds and TIPS.  He argues for this allocation essentially because its safe and should be ok under unexpectedly high or low inflation.  Thanks for your thoughts!

Checked my credit score yesterday using experian and it said my FICO score is now 760. I have about 15,000 saved up from the last year and want to invest in real estate. BUT I get discouraged when I read people's comments about how it takes LOTS of capital to get started in real estate.. especially when I work for minimum wage plus TIPS. I'm grateful i make decent income through tips sometimes but I'm not exactly a money-making machine at the moment.
 I really want to start looking at real estate to invest in.. particularly in Texas, where its cheaper. Would I be making a fool of myself if I were to ask a lender how much they'd be willing to lend me with my 15k down payment? If i could get a ballpark figure from a lender it would make narrowing my property options down so much easier! Any suggestions or input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance",0

I can see that the stock is pretty much struggling around the hundreds and I need to decide of my strategy...

There’s overwhelming academic evidence that suggests that these stocks will outperform their more popular brethren over the long term, as they have in the past. But you need patience here. Over the past 10 years, the fund returned 9.1% annualized. Expenses are 0.09% annually.""

So these stocks tend to beat the stock market average, if I understand him correctly, but he only suggests investing 10% of an index fund portfolio in them.  Why not invest much more, in that instance?  Is there something I'm missing here?

(NYSE MKT: MGT) today announces the appointment of Nolan Bushnell to its Board of Directors. Bushnell will serve as an independent director, effective immediately.

Nolan Bushnell is a technology pioneer who is best known as the founder of the Atari Corporation and Chuck E. Cheese. Bushnell has also founded more than 20 companies during his career, including Catalyst Technologies, the first technology incubator; ByVideo, the first online ordering system; Etak, the first digital navigation system; UWink, the first touchscreen menu ordering and entertainment system; and BrainRush, an educational software company. Bushnell also served as a director on the boards of Wave Systems Corporation, a developer and distributor of hardware-based digital security products, and of AirPatrol Corporation/Sysorex (NASDAQ: SYRX), which makes indoor positioning systems. He was also on the board of directors at Neoedge Networks, a technology and in-game advertising company that enabled casual game publishers to deliver television-like commercials within their products.

John McAfee, proposed Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of MGT Capital, stated, ""Nolan is one of the brightest minds in cyber technology. In his career, he has founded more than 20 high tech companies, giving him unprecedented knowledge of the tech industry. As a director, he will help MGT identify and cultivate the necessary strategic partnerships to position the company as the world leader in cyber security.""

""As founder of Atari, one of the first Silicon Valley mega-success stories, Nolan single handedly created the video game industry and continues to shape its future today. It is within this industry that much of the leading edge artificial intelligence techniques are being applied, and I believe artificial intelligence will shape the future of cyber security and provide the impetus for MGT's success,"" concluded McAfee.

Bushnell commented, ""I am excited to join MGT along with John McAfee to build one of the most powerful cyber security companies in the industry and address an increasing number of cyber threats.  There is an ever evolving flow of threats through the advancements of electronic devices we use every day with very little user protection.  The opportunity is enormous in this market, and the existing companies in the cyber security space are too busy looking backwards in order to protect their existing market share to see what is happening in the market now.  We at MGT are going to approach the market from a completely different perspective, by addressing these immediate needs as our priority."" ",13

&amp;nbsp;

This is for my taxable brokerage account. I inherited it and it was 100% invested in a mutual fund that was underperforming the overall market, so I sold and am planning to re-allocate as follows. 

&amp;nbsp;

Total account value: $30,000

Investment timeline: 5-10+ years 

Risk tolerance: Moderate - looking for aggressive growth, but I don’t want to actively trade much. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Planned portfolio**:

&amp;nbsp;

$VTI - 16.7% ($5,000) - [Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF] (http://www.morningstar.com/etfs/ARCX/VTI/quote.html)


My reasoning: broad stock diversification, low expense ratio.

&amp;nbsp;

$FUSEX - 16.7% ($5,000) - [Fidelity S&amp;P 500 mutual fund] (http://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/fusex/quote.html)


My reasoning: S&amp;P exposure, and no transaction fee (so I can contribute small amounts regularly)

&amp;nbsp;

$VDC - 10% ($3,000) - [Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF] (http://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/vdc/quote.html)


My reasoning: Low expense ratio, likely to hold up a bit better in a market downturn vs. the general market. 

&amp;nbsp;

$FBSOX - 10% ($3,000) - [Fidelity Select IT Services (Tech)] (http://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/fbsox/quote.html)


My reasoning: Tech exposure. Good performance. No transaction fee, so good for contributing small amounts regularly which I plan to do. 

&amp;nbsp;

$FSMEX - 10% ($3,000) - [Fidelity Select Medical Equipment] (http://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/fsmex/quote.html)


My reasoning: I want some exposure to health care. Impressive 10-year annualized return (12.87%), outperformed S&amp;P 500 this year despite downturn in health industry, and held up fairly well even in 2008. No transaction fee

&amp;nbsp;

$VNQ - 8% ($2,500) - [Vanguard REIT ETF](http://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/vnq/quote.html)


My reasoning: REIT exposure, low fees

&amp;nbsp;

CASH - 16.7% ($5,000) - Cash 


My reasoning: I would like to keep some cash on hand to evaluate opportunities on individual stocks, or to simply buy into the general market on the next dip. 

&amp;nbsp;

?? - 11.7% ($3,500) - Bonds? Gold? Global equity? Suggestions?

&amp;nbsp;

I’d appreciate any advice or comments you might have for me!

16-06-07,4mxpq6,JUNO Juno Therapeutics looks to be breaking out on high volume.,"Pure speculation play.

I believe JUNO presents a compelling investment into the realm of CAR-T and cancer treatment. 

The firm is a clinical-stage company developing novel cellular immunotherapies based on two distinct and complementary platforms, Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CARs) and T Cell Receptors (TCRs) technologies. The company’s stated goal is “to revolutionize medicine by re-engaging the body’s immune system to treat cancer.” The company has partnerships with world leading research institutes including the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and the Seattle Children's Research Institute.

Currently there are no Hedge Funds with significant positions in the company which could mean this company is a diamond in the rough or fund managers do not have faith the company will succeed. 

https://hedgemind.com/stocks/JUNO

Juno was named to “MIT Technology Review’s 50 Smartest Companies” in 2015.

On June 4 2016 JUNO announced ""its investigational chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell product candidates are demonstrating encouraging clinical outcomes for adults and children with B-cell malignancies.""

     “We are encouraged by the continued efficacy and duration of response that we are seeing with our defined cell products in                         patients with B cell malignancies. We are moving rapidly to start potential registration trials for JCAR017 across a range of B cell malignancies, including ALL, NHL, and CLL,” said Mark J. Gilbert, M.D., Juno’s Chief Medical Officer. “As our understanding of JCAR017 and JCAR014 evolves, we are increasingly able to study these defined cell product candidates in the outpatient setting, which may allow for greater access to our technologies over time.”

JCAR014 showed patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to have complete remission reported in 34/34 (100%) patients and complete molecular remission as measured by flow cytometry (CmR) was achieved in 32/34 (94%) patients.

JCAR017 showed ""Rebecca Gardner, M.D., of Seattle Children’s, announced results from Seattle Children’s Phase I study of JCAR017 in pediatric and young adults with CD19+ r/r ALL (n=42) demonstrating 39/42 (93%) patients experienced a complete remission, all of which were a CmR by flow cytometry. In patients who received the Flu/Cy preconditioning regimen, 14/14 (100%) achieved a complete remission and a CmR. sCRS was observed in 10/42 (24%) patients and Grade 3 or higher neurotoxicity was observed in 10/42 (24%) patients.""

In total they have 10 candidates in Phase I/II Trials.

Cancer immunotherapy drugs accounted for about 50% of the overall oncology drugs market, generating about $41.0 billion in 2014.

Juno and Celgene have a 10 year collaboration.    

     "" Celgene Corporation and Juno Therapeutics, Inc. are engaged in a ten-year collaboration to advance T cell therapeutic strategies to develop treatments for patients with cancer and autoimmune diseases, with an initial focus on CAR and TCR technologies. In April 2016 Celgene exercised its option under the collaboration to develop and commercialize the Juno CD19 program outside North America and China. The CD19 program includes investigational product candidates and their safety and efficacy have not been established.""

Celgene paid $150 million in cash and bought 9.1 million newly issued Juno shares at $93 a share.

Currently margins are low due to the high cost of the personalized medicine which could eventually put a damper in profitability along with the current media attention to high drug prices could force the company to keep pricing below what they could normally price treatments. 

""Juno, Kite and Novartis are all seeking to obtain FDA approval and launch their CAR-T candidates in 2017. In comparison to Juno and Kite, Novartis has the best regulatory management and manufacturing resources, which could give them an advantage in the market and lower the drug prices. All the companies mentioned above are developing the second generation CAR-T with added control systems, or ""off the shelf"" TCR technology. Strategic partnerships are essential - for instance, Juno is teamed up with Editas, Kite is collaborating with bluebird, and Cellectis is partnered with Pfizer."" - Seeking Alpha


In China JW Biotechnology has partnered with JUNO to license its CAR-T and T-Cell Receptors.

The company currently has $316 million in cash and virtually no debt. The company finally began earning revenue this year. 

I believe based off of a DCF analysis that the company has 150% upside potential.

16-06-07,4mxwie,The Fed is trying to keep the stock market constrained to avoid a greater bubble.,"So thinking about the Fed and interest rates, and their continuing threat to raise rates, I came to a hypothesis that the Fed does not want to raise rates any more than they have to and are only doing so to prevent the stock market from running away. 

I think the fed knows that raising rates would have a detrimental impact on the American consumer and that the most recent jobs report hints that things aren't as strong as the Fed keeps telling us. But in order to prevent a massive market crash in the future, when rates inevitably return to ""normal"", they are using the threat of a rate hike to keep markets at bay. 

If this hypothesis is correct, the Fed won't raise rates until the market starts gaining momentum, and it will happen with a disregard to data about the economy. And  this would make the markets the leading indicator the Fed is looking at.

Vanguard life strategy funds state a cost (OCF) of 0.24%.

The payout includes a EUR300,000 bonus for 2007 and over EUR150,000 for unfair dismissal and damages.

Société Générale GLE, +1.82%  said the labor court’s decision is “incomprehensible” and inconsistent with a decision from France’s Supreme Court, the Cour de Cassation.


“It is counter to the facts that have been judged. We will appeal against this decision,” the French bank said.

The ruling comes as Kerviel faces a separate civil case due to start next week before an appeals court on how much he should pay the bank to make up for losses he allegedly caused. Kerviel was accused of making market bets that brought France’s second-largest listed bank to the verge of collapse in 2008.",11

16-06-07,4mzpyj,$SWHC What you need to know going into earnings season.,"1. Financial Quarter - S&amp;W is reporting for February, March and April. (read: May isn't part of results, but will figure into projections)

2. NICS - On record pace for 2016. Projecting June YoY growth conservatively, the 1H of the calendar year has seen 24% growth. http://i.imgur.com/PaUvInh.png

3. Handguns - S&amp;W primarily makes money off of handguns which are increasingly a larger number of overall guns sales. 

4. Production - Stock on hand took a huge hit with the massive holiday seasonality. S&amp;W had to use CNC contractors to create major components of guns for this past quarter, and cautioned against an earnings beat due to this challenge. 

5. News - Absent of a mass shooting, which does spike gun sales, Hillary winning the nomination will be a positive catalyst in the last half of the year.

Personal view: It is very unclear if earnings will beat, there is a chance. S&amp;W has a strong record of beats and is conservative in their guidance, so I am optimistic. At the end of the day, you aren't going to be bag holding some piece of shit bio. This is the Coke, Ford, Budweiser of the gun world. If you have the capital to hold until the end of the year if need be, this is a good upside play without intense risk. 

That said, I feel ~$22.00 based on P/E is fair market value. Much of the runup to $30.00 was pricing in NICS numbers. For this to pop, we'll need to see guidance adjusted for the remainder of the year. 

I'm in with 400 shares at $22.90 and going to be averaging down on another 400 shares this week. ",23

So I am wanting to pick a strategy for this portfolio and either want to go for momentum stocks or for special situation stocks (i.e. a stock that might be temporarily cheap like an oil major after a spill).  I think overall the pros seem to have done better with momentum strategies but I am just an amateur and was wondering if anybody had any input on which strategy might be more suitable.

16-06-07,4mzvgw,WSB Weekly Herald: Controversy as Financial Forum Ranks #3 in OUT Magazine’s “Top LGBT Chatrooms”,"***The Wall Street Bets Weekly Herald***

**Controversy as Financial Forum Ranks #3 in OUT Magazine’s “Top LGBT Chatrooms”**

Praising the community for their “refreshingly bold approach to celebrating homosexuality”, the June edition of OUT magazine ranked the forum “Wall Street Bets” as the third-best gay chat room on the internet.  Despite the shining review, the ranking has sparked a fierce debate among the gay community, with some asking, “how proud is too proud?”

The review in question: 

*“Boasting trades named with crude homosexual terms, open praise for any and all variations of sodomy, and at times, a pleasant array of dicks on their header; Wall Street Bets has brought a rebellious pride to the gay investment community.  A select few have even opened a trading firm, ‘Fags with Funds’!  With their refreshingly bold approach to celebrating homosexuality, the WSB community has secured it's place as a home for the trading gay. If you want to talk about sucking dicks while taking some financial risks, Wall Street Bets is the place to go.”*

The forum, originally created as a place to discuss investments and options trades, quickly gained a reputation of being a “safe space” for LGBTs in the financial world.  “I always felt nervous in traditional trading chatrooms, as a burgeoning homosexual I was afraid of the other guys making fun of me and not taking me seriously” bitched long-time member u/theycallme1. “I've honestly never been as turned on as I am when reading WSB threads” admitted fellow user u/bawse1.  “I know he's just a troll, but I can't help but let him keep posting - you should see his dick pics!” explained forum creator u/jartek as to why he hadn't yet banned notorious shitposter u/FSComeau from the community.  

The forum’s popularity in the gay community was drastically boosted after sexually confused high school senior u/World_Chaos made a staggering $60,000 in options. “In the money I made, I also found the strength to reveal my true self to my family and friends. I definitely owe Wall Street Bets for my success in both financial and personal matters, if it wasn't for them, me and my twenty thousand cock-gobbling little friends wouldn't have had anywhere else to go!” 

Even celebrities took part in the festivities. “Those guys literally sucked my [ego’s] throbbing dick for 6 hours a day” said ‘Pharmabro’ Martin Shkreli in an interview. “I’d just turn my webcam on and they’d be scrambling for the chance to slobber all over my [YouTube channel].”

Wall Street Bets’ penchants for taking flamboyance to a whole new level contributed to the national gay community’s hesitation to accept them. In a brief phone conversation, gay pride advocate Cho Kasandik shared his hesitations to praising them. “I know what a faggot’s delight is, and it sure as hell doesn't take three thousand dollars and something called an options account. If you're paying more than one fifty for a swole, hairy top to tear your ass apart, you're not a faggot - you're just a bitch.”  

Child pornography charges are also pending for the 35,000 members who saw underage user u/hypnotwist’s multiple posts swinging his tiny dick around. “I swear to god, I had no idea he was fifteen!” said u/pcx99, who himself faces charges for sexual exploitation of a minor after a long string of erotic messages between him and the teenager were made public.  “I thought I knew him well enough, but c’mon - everyone knows my due diligence always ends in a massive clusterfuck.”

Despite the controversy, no one is denying that Wall Street Bets is home to the most obscene collection of faggots on the internet.  “I’m probably the straightest dude here,” joked u/toadkiller in a pathetic attempt to avoid facing the truth, “and I just finished bleaching my asshole!”

16-06-07,4mzyey,Deep dive interview with Foundry Capital: How to find small-cap ideas,"Insights on small-cap investing. In particular, how Foundry Capital finds worthwhile investments.

""I don’t run screens, I don’t find a lot of value looking only at quantitative factors ­numbers typically won’t uncover a hidden story. You will not find a turnaround in a screen, you will find cheap stocks cheap for a reason, as the same companies typically come up every time as they remain cheap. Oftentimes I think running screens for “cheap” stocks leads to a lot of value traps. I like to look for change occurring in micro­cap companies. Rarely is the news announced in major publications, and you have fewer investors looking at the same companies.

For example, a $16 million market cap company is spinning off an unprofitable unit that they have wasted millions of dollars trying to ramp up and getting running. The parent company is profitable and a good business, but if you are looking backwards, the combined company is losing money. This company has also issued a ton of shares in order to fund this side business. It will be spun off this month. I don’t want to disclose the name at this point as I am building a position.

I look at some sources, paid services and talk to other buy-siders that are like minded. I use SumZero, Value Investors Club, a few random blogs, SEC 13D filings with Hedge Fund Solutions, SEC 13F’ filings for small funds, but overall the one thing consistent with the ideas we invest in, is change. Some sort of change in the company, an activist forcing change, spinoff, selling segments, turning profitable, hiring turnaround specialists, selling assets, having a new stud CEO take over with a history of selling companies, etc.

I am industry agnostic, and truly bottoms up, although I tend to stay away from biotechs, banking, energy and materials ­ more for a lack of understanding or due to commodity price movements, in which case neither I, nor management, or for that matter anyone, knows where a commodity price is going over the next 1, 2 or 3 years.""

Same with the semiconductor business. Nvidia, AMD, Intel all crushed this quarter. Applied Materials (that makes shit for the semi conductor business) released their earnings after the previous 3. I made 500% off calls on AMAT.

Now it's time for Verifone to crush earnings. Their european counterpart, Ingenico Group went up 8% 3 days after earnings... and European companies are all garbage.

Do a google image search for verifone. With the new chip readers, every fucking store in the world is going to be switching to new Verifone readers. I'll bet my dick that you've had to use their new chip readers recently.

16-06-08,4n3x79,Sell an option,"Might be a stupid question, but I want to get this right.

Let's say I have a trading account at a broker with 1000$ on it.

I buy 1 call option for some stock $XYZ for 100$. $XYZ is currently at 40$, my call option has a strike of 50$.

$XYZ moves to 55$. This is higher than what I expected, so I want to take my profits. Since my account balance is now only 900$, I cannot exercise the option (50*100=5000$).

Instead I want to sell my call for a higher premium than what I bought it at. I log in to my broker, go to the option, open the trading window and select ""Sell to open"". Someone buys it for 200$. Great, 100$ profit.

But now my question:
Assuming the underlying goes up to 60$. The buyer of the call I sold decides to exercise it since he has more cash than me. Who has to sell him 100 shares of the underlying for 50$? Is it me, because I sold the call to him, or is it someone who initially decided to write that option?

16-06-07,4n02x4,Do Markets Care About Copper Anymore?,"Today, copper prices are plunging lower by more than 3.0 percent. Yet, the financial news media barely talks about it. Years ago copper prices were followed closely by all stock market participants. In fact, the legendary trader Jesse Livermore used to say that copper prices were one of the most important commodities that anyone could follow. He would follow copper prices in order to predict future stock market direction. 

Traders can now track the action in copper by following the iPath Bloomberg Copper Subindex Total Return Sub-Index ETN (NYSEARCA:JJC). This morning, the JJC is trading lower by 0.87 cents (-3.59 percent). The current pattern on the daily and weekly charts looks very poor technically. The JJC is trading below its daily chart 50 and 200-day moving averages. The JJC peaked out in February 2011 at $61.69 a share. The next major support level on the JJC chart is the December 2008 low which was $17.97. 

It appears that the major stock market institutions no longer care about the price of copper. This former leading indicator remains extremely weak at this time and could be signaling further economic problems in China and other emerging markets. Until the copper price can form a definitive bottoming pattern it is best to steer clear of this commodity. We can only wonder if copper will ever matter again when it comes to predicting stock market direction?",8

16-06-07,4n1ms5,Some thoughts on Data Center REITs,"I'm a firm believer in low-cost diversified index allocations. Yeah, I'm a  Boglehead. The proof is in the pudding: data shows that low-cost diversified index allocations provide reliable returns over time. In other words, average is good.

But another aspect of the ""pudding"" I can't ignore is some of Warren Buffett's frequent quotes like ""investing in strong companies that outdo their peers and whose business have a high barrier of entry""  or something of this essence. In other words being on the right side of the median is good.

To me, life is not black or white. One can have a Bogglehead allocation for average returns yet sprinkle some ""better than median"" return salt like Warren for a better tasting portfolio.

Data center REITs raised my interest since my line of work is close enough that I understand the technical part and the growth prospects. 

In short the ""data center REIT"" industry will be doing awesome for the foreseable future. Demand for data center real estate outstrips supply and the barrier of entry is fairly high so there are only 6 data center REITs. Moreover they are ""frenemies"" who seem to not compete directly with one another, thus protecting profits. They are also 2 sub-categories: the category I call ""barebone"", a true REIT that focuses on infrastructure, providing only electricity, connectivity and a roof over one's head and the ""cloud subcategory"" which provides hosting on top of that.

The Cloud subcategory (despite all the hype) is very risky IMHO because customer needs are so diverse and servers depreciate fast. It's also harder to respond to change for the cloud subcategory as software needs created each time, which leads to complexity. 

By contrast the ""barebone"" category is customer-agnostic. Amazon can be their customer, or a Bank or Google. Customers roll in their own racks and servers in the form factor each has standardized and it's less headache. It's a model easier to replicate in multiple locations too and thus it scales better, easier and faster. Think economies of scale. Also the ""cloud subcategory"" may lease space from the ""barebone subcategory"". So the ""barebone subcategory"" ends up laughing all the way to the bank.


But I digress.


Out of the ""barebones"" category, the leader is Digital Realty Trust [DLR](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=DLR) and the second up-and-coming [DuPont Fabros Technology, Inc](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=DFT) a mutliple smaller looks decent. 

Also Yahoo reports a beta of -0.03 for Digital Realty meaning it's inverse correlated to the market. Inverse correlation and growth with good prospects at the same time is good in my book.

Of course puting all eggs in one basket is foolish as an omelette lasts 1 meal whereas a chicken lasts the lifetime of a chicken.


But sprinkled over an ""average"" allocation, leaders in a growing field with a high barrier of entry fueled by our cloud addiction of smartphones promises to move any allocation closer to the good side of median. Keeping in mind that any REIT really makes sense only in a tax-deferred account.

I read that the currency in circulation has not spiked, because the increase in monetary base was use to tie up balance sheets on the big banks.  

https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/MBCURRCIR

The article I was looking at indicated that the FED total assets would shrink back as the big banks start paying off the loans from the FED.

https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/WALCL

Ok... so is the growth in the monetary base directly tied to the FED assets?  If the big banks start paying off their loans successfully, will the monetary base shrink back down?

Lastly, what does the FED balance sheet look like?  Assets = Liabilities + Owner Equity.  If they are growing their assets side, what's funding that?  Where's the liabilities?  Why, when they take care of their liabilities, would the monetary base go back down?

I don't think this waits until he's in office, I think this collapse begins when polls show a decisive lead for Trump (i.e., after Clinton's email bullshit is on every news network 24/7 and it's too late for anybody else to run in her place). The administration will blame Trump for the economic collapse, saying that the markets are afraid of Trump and what he will do to the global economic climate.

me and my friend have created a site with interactive fundamental charts and historical financials for US stocks: https://stockrow.com/. You can chart over 100 fundamental ratios on a 10-year time frame, check accounting red flags, peers or export all data to excel. The site is free, no need to register.

We are currently in beta and there will be more features in the next few weeks, but I am posting this to see if there is anyone who finds the site useful :) Prices are end of day, over 6000 active and delisted stocks are available (ADRs are not included yet). I used Ycharts a lot when they were free and after they went behind a paywall I felt a free site was needed (maybe I'm wrong). I know our website currently offers only a fraction of data but hopefully we will add more features and regions as time goes by.

I took a 27% hit from PAY but only after averaging out the losses I am at -1.6% as of 30 minutes into the market. Unless $LULU somehow pulls something more out of itself then maybe we are looking at a flat day.

Looks like today's earnings include $SJM, $TLDR, and $GEF
TLDR reports earnings today in AH.
Day 1  +9%
Day 2  -1.8% 

EDIT: Finished today -.2% on Earning Calls

Now its about watching TLRD and ABM

Lets compare the two most recent bull cycles. Note the difference in the slope on the lines. The most recent rally has a gentler slope, it occurred over a longer period of time. This is a favorable, more stable rally. On both rallies we've seen a pullback after testing the 2110 level. Both times the index has retreated into a descending channel. Unlike the previous rally, this time we have seen upward movement through resistance levels. This break of resistance reaffirms the upward momentum and signals that the trend still has room to run. In the next couple of weeks the market could test all time highs. ",13

&gt;Long Individual equity positions that I have researched               

I have neglected to display a small 5k position in ARCOs last time around, the Mcdonald franchise in Latin America on the last screenshot and a few other insignificant stub positions. There has been no movement of capital (distribution or contribution) since last month. 

Current 1 month performance is 7.4%, primarily driven by the rally in GDXJ and CRESUD. SPX(S&amp;P) has gone up slightly which is hedged out by the slight decrease in 10 year treasury yield (IEF), leaving those positions largely net neutral. Returns have primarily been driven by the continued weakness in the dollar and continued hesitancy towards a rate hike by the fed, leading to higher gold and EM pricing. Going forward, I will be focused on total returns and not be tracking the sharpe ratio because I fundamentally disagree with the concept that volatility is risk.

Most commentators are either intro-to-economics students, people who haven't entered a single position in the market, or those with a neutral stance of defeatism that ""investing is a losing game,"" ""this can't be because it goes against common sense,"" ""this certain method of investing doesn't work because 95% of people blow up their accounts.

16-06-08,4n5rpt,UnitedHealth - A conservative growth stock with steadily increasing income,"Health Insurers set drug prices. They have massive datasets that are both broad and deep. The industry is rapidly consolidating through both vertical and horizontal integration.

The network effect is strong and UnitedHealth is the largest insurer. They invest heavily in technology through their subsidiary Optum and sell services to other insurers and providers. They are transitioning from an insurance company to an arbiter of healthcare prices and they are investing heavily into technology to help them do so. 
 
In my opinion you get the best of many worlds with this stock. As the largest health insurer in an industry that benefits from scale they have a wide moat. Their investments in technology should provide growth opportunities for many years to come. Currently their dividend pays 1.5% and has been growing ~30% yoy since 2010.

Being an insurer they are subject to political risks. Having withdrawn from the healthcare.gov marketplaces they've taken steps to limit this exposure. Single payer healthcare would kill off their insurance business but Optum would still be strong and would likely sell its services to the government.

16-06-08,4n63ru,"IAMA British political pollster. Brexit isn't just a possibility, Brexit is going to happen, how should I best make money off of it?","Basically while the polls look tight now, they are being quite deceiving. This is a referendum that differs from most British elections, and because of that the usual models used in the polling industry need to be adjusted.  Long story short, British media isn't much different from American media or any other media in that they want to try and control the narrative somewhat, and they are trying to do the same here.  They don't want Brexit to happen, so they are trying to avoid any narrative that describes it as likely.  Even though you are starting to see some news reports describe ""support for Brexit growing"", these are significantly downplaying the true story.  I know this because I have personally participated in changing the models (or more accurately, using the wrong models on purpose) to help supply the polls for these stories.

Brexit is going to happen.  The probability is already above 50%, and the trends are only going up.  There are no major potential events that could swing public support against Brexit that are likely to happen (or even unlikely to happen), only potential major events that could further increase support for Brexit (any other terrorist attack anywhere in Europe would essentially seal the deal for example).

While a desktop stock scanner can certainly do some of this, I've distilled all the manual configuration and price adjustments in a way that just shows daily, higher-highs and lower-lows in a reliable hassle-free way.

Moving beyond MOMO 1.0 for iOS I want to get out the Android build.  I've struggled and have had a couple of hopeful quasi-interested devs want to partake, but still on the lookout.  If into stocks and want to program in Xamarin, Socket.io, Node, etc. please connect. 

**If you are an android user - and would like to check out our free alpha, please email me.  It's stable, but missing some features, but hopefully this will help you make some $$$ while at the same time think of new features you would like to see added.**

- As not all stocks are denominated in USD, you will find some apparent outliers, e.g. Arkema France (EUR) and BBA Aviation PLC (GBP).

16-06-09,4n8ny0,The bull case for MSTX,"Not too long ago, I opened up a position in Mast Therapeutics.  It's not a large position and one I'm content with losing, but I'd like to make a few observations about this company and why I feel that they have a good chance at phase 3 success.

1. Some weak hands panic sold yesterday when it was announced that there would be a delay in reporting the results from their EPIC trial.  This even led to speculation that the CEO is intending to bail and is preparing an exit strategy.  Well, today, the patent exclusivity announcement seems to have doused those fires for the moment.  The company has been carrying on as expected, and they are even actively enrolling patients in their extension study, EPIC-E, to further strengthen their planned NDA filing.  It takes a bit of confidence to be carrying out followup studies at this point prior to the formal EPIC results release.

2. The original vepoloxamer trial undertaken by CytRx barely failed the target p-value at 0.07 (0.05 was needed).  The current EPIC trial builds upon those results by focusing on the highest performing patient categories.  Children &lt;16 had average crisis duration reduced by 22 hours (p=0.01), while those who were taking concurrent hydroxyurea had a benefit of 16 hours (p=0.02).  These patient subgroups constituted only 29% and 22% of the original CytRx study.  In Mast's EPIC trial, the aggregate average is 15, with 71% of patients being &lt;18.  &gt;60% of total patients are also using concurrent hydroxyurea.  All other factors being equal, this alone might be enough to push the statistical confidence over the hump.

3.  Patient monitoring is no longer cut off at 168 hours.  As a slow-acting agent, vepoloxamer seems to have effects that last well past the initial observation period.  This may be reflected in the EPIC study and is also the reason behind the recently-announced delay since every patient, due to followups, generates several weeks of data that have to be independently verified and signed off by each individual test center.  They have to give these results 3 passes, and they've done one and are halfway through the second.  The data will not be locked and unblinded until this process is complete.

MSTX is pure speculation for me, but I feel pretty confident going into July with my position.",42

16-06-09,4naq4n,LPCN - June 28 PFDA for testosterone pill,"Anyone follow this company? I know all you WSB jabronis have big balls but this company is there to help those who don't....

""Lipocine (LPCN) has been developing a new treatment for hypogonadism, a disease causing a lack of endogenous testosterone. In anticipation of the drug LPCN-1021 nearing its PDUFA dates the market potential of this new testosterone-deficiency treatment is big. 

Why Investors Should Care
- The FDA set new guidelines in March 2015 stating that men experiencing low testosterone levels due to natural aging should not receive treatment.
- LPCN-1021 met its Phase 3 trial endpoint, as over 75% of subjects were within the age-appropriate average levels of testosterone.
-  The PDUFA date for LPCN-1021 is June 28th. With the implications the drug could have for the company, an expert call could help investors position themselves in advance of the review date.""",1

* Here are the actual statistics from the FBI: https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/nics/reports/nics_firearm_checks_-_month_year.pdf. You can see from the numbers that April 2016 is up 25% over April 2015 and that May 2016 is only up 18% from May 2015 - but it's still up 18%! That CNBC/TheStreet numbers don't match the FBI stats.
* The upcoming earnings is for the last quarter that does not include May only Feb/Mar/Apr 2016 and for all those months background weapon checks are way up over 2015.
* It's a real company that is very successful in earnings and revenue growth, even if the stock does not recover from the earnings report immediately; the stock was oversold relative to the value of the company, on almost every valuation the company is strong (P/E, revenue growth, earnings growth, etc.).

It has been said that the IPO will be used to pay off debts and finance further and faster growth into the rest of Europe. 

Basic Fit is the first chain of gyms that has been advertising on TV as it has gyms nationwide in the Netherlands, so there's high brand recognition. But critics say that competition is high and customers aren't loyal and prices for membership are already quite low (Basic Fit charges €17,99 pm for memberships). 

&gt;The shares have been priced between €15 and €20, valuing Basic-Fit at between €994 million (£779 million) and €1.14 billion (£897 million). 

&gt;Basic-Fit, which has more than a million members, generated €202 million in revenues last year with underlying earnings (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) of €60 million. Based on the top end of the range, the float values Basic-Fit at around 6 times earnings.

16-06-09,4nb4kq,Idea for a simple strategy to allocated between stocks an bonds.,"Hey guys, looks like we missed the last moronic Monday post, but hopefully this is good enough to merit its own post.  Once of the concept from the intelligent investor is maintaining an allocation of 25 to 75 percent common stocks and the remainder in bonds.

The idea as i understand it, is whenever you rebalance you are either selling expensive stocks to protect those gains in bonds or selling bonds to buy cheap stocks.

I pull the last 9 years of $SPY and $BND data from google finance, and used that to calculate the average monthly price of each, and tested how the allocation between each worked.  Over this period, a 100% investment in SPY always outperformed any allocation to bonds.

But I thought since that period included the huge 2008 crash there must be some advantage to holding bonds somehow.

I back tested a strategy where I started with and 50/50 division.  Each month, if the SPY went down compared to previous months price, I subtracted 1% from my bonds and add it to stocks.  So after 3 months of declining stock prices id be rebalancing to 53% stock and 47% bonds.  This strategy pretty drastically outperformed either 100% stock or any unchanging balanced (90/10, 75/25 etc).  I also said that by bond allocation never drops below 10%.

9 years isn't a lot of data to go on, and I'm sure its easy to find an strategy that outperforms the market if you just back test enough strategies.  Still this seems like a simple strategy.  Buy cheap, sell high.  

Intuitively this strategy would perform poorly in a long term bull market.  It only helps you when there is a crash.  I suspect you'd have done well during the recent February crash, but it probably under performs if you look at just the last 5 years.

Limitations of my back testing

* only looking at 9 years
* Limitation of my back testing is i didn't have dividend information.  
* I didn't consider trading fees.

I think the Strategy could be further improved by setting a maximum allocation to bonds, maybe Gram's 75%.  I think the 1% is also fairly arbitrarily.  Reducing or increasing the allocation to stocks based on a factor proportional to the change in stock prices or proportional to the change in stock price compared to the change in bong price might be a beneficial.

I'm curious what people think of this.  Any stupid things I should have though of?  Do you think I just found a stupid strategy happens to work over my test period or do you think there is some merit to it.

Edit: Another thing I just realized, my back testing started literally right as a crash occurred, and its a strategy that definitely going to handle a crash quite well (compared to all stocks).  Definitely next steps would be to test a whole host of other time periods.

Edit: I can only get $BND history from 2007.   Any one have an idea on what i could use to test bonds returns from 1996 to 2006?  See how the strategy does over that period?",2

My other brokerage is what you would call ""cash-poor"" right now (see bagholding), so I decided to call my main brokerage (only way when PDT) and have them place a few orders to take advantage of upcoming volatility. One of those was going to be a strangle on DUST. I had him fill the order on the call side of DUST at the 10 strike for june monthlies, then put in an order for the put side at the 9.5 strike. We waited and it never got filled (spread was 0.20, and I came in 0.05 below ask), then I noticed how illiquid that strike was, and said fuck it , let's just play it with NUGT instead. So here's where I fuck up. Doing this stupid ass trade over the phone was a terrible idea, and I guess I confused myself by placing an order for puts on NUGT instead of calls... it filled.

16-06-09,4nb8pa,HRB Earnings Play,"H &amp; R Block announces earnings for Q4 today after close.
Consensus estimates are $3.15(Schwab)/$3.09(Zacks)  with a high and low of $3.29 and $2.79

[Some light reading] (http://finance.yahoo.com/news/h-r-block-hrb-earnings-125212998.html)

I am going to play them short with $20 6/17 Puts, current bid is $0.50.

Share price is rising ahead of earnings, good time to get some Puts on sale.

Reasoning:

- They have missed 9 out of the last 12 quarterly estimates.  
- Last quarter was a -30.77% surprise. Per Zacks Equity Research Report, this is largely due to a 6.7% YOY reduction in revenue, 1.7% increase in operating expenses, cash &amp; cash equivalents down 81% YOY, and a $2.6B increase in outstanding long-term debt.  
- Short interest as of 2/29 is 3.3%  
- 30 day Put/Call ratio is 2.0, 1 day P/C is 1.2  
- Nasdaq community rating: Bearish  
- Over the last 4 weeks, 2 analysts revisions Down  
- Given a Schwab Equity Rating of 'F' 

However, things to keep in mind:  
- In Q3, HRB repurchased 12 million shares ($393M). Bringing the total number of repurchased shares to 52.5 (19% of outstanding shares, worth $19B) through the first three quarters of FY'16.  
- Q4 is tax season, where the company really rakes in the $$. In recent news (April 26, 2016) HRB announces US assisted returns fell 5.8% through April 19 and tax returns prepared through the company's tax software products dropped 2.6%.


Previous Q4 results are as follows:  
Q4 2015: Estimate $2.6905 EPS Miss - $0.0005 / &lt;1%  
Q4 2014: Estimate $32331 EPS Beat + $0.0069 / &lt;1%  
Q4 2013: Estimate $2.6117 EPS Miss - $0.0717 / -2.75%

Tell me why this is a poor play. GFY

I have set the price to be x plus 10%) Now for the error, whenever I try to put the order in the online broker (Degiro) tells me I can't do this as I am creating a 'short error'. I'm not sure why it's telling me this, does anyone have any idea what causes this or perhaps can see im being silly and tell me how to set up a sell at 'x-price' order?

16-06-09,4nd6ri,So you want to short China? DD: EEV,"Greetings aspiring yachtsmen. I see a lot of talk on here (and on just about every other financial news source) discussing the Chinese economy. While there's a lot of data and discussion out there, an overall picture of what's going on is about as clear as the Shijiazhuang sky. In this post I'd like to discuss my view of what's actually going on, and how to trade accordingly. As real estate is my area of expertise, much of my discussion of overall Chinese economic trends will be framed through this specific aspect of the economy. 

**1: Same Same, but Different**

Analysis of the Chinese economy, and sectors within it, is tricky. Simply put, China is NOT a free market, and its markets do not behave like a free market system. While fundamentals of supply and demand apply to Chinese firms, government intervention often helps slow down or reverse market forces that would otherwise send Chinese companies into the ground. 

Ever heard about the ""ghost cities""? Well some of the ghost cities people have pointed to in 2010 and later as a sign of unsustainable economic policy are now filled with people and thriving. Central planning allows China to accomplish feats that would be impossible in a free market system. The power of the government to step in and micromanage the economy is unprecedented in its limitations and encouragement of capital flow. For instance, reactive interest rate control has been able to slow down real estate speculation or ramp up investment in Chinese real estate submarkets, essential keeping bubbles from forming. This is a plus for the overall Chinese economy, but is it sustainable? Government intervention is a fundamental concern in analysis of any Chinese company, index, or market.

**Part 2: Bubbling Up**

Many analysts point to a bubble in China. Whether its debt or real estate, the ""unsustainable"" growth of the Chinese economy can only collapse on itself... or will it not?   
Chinese real estate transactions have historically been carried out with lower leverage than those in the west. This subsequently has kept huge speculation bubbles from forming. However, peer to peer and ""shadow bank lending"" has allowed greater access to capital to individuals and property investors. Mortgages have become more popular among Chinese who see real estate as a great vehicle for return and might have been scared off of equities by the Q1 2016 drop. [Figure 1](http://imgur.com/FA9cc6i)  

""Since September, home prices in China’s biggest cities — Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen — have risen by a minimum of 13.9% month over month. They rose an average of 22.4% in those four cities in January. Prices in Shenzhen have increased a ridiculous 72% in the past 12 months alone, according to the Shenzhen Urban Planning, Land and Resources Commission."" (Forbes, 3/10/2016)

In response to this surge in value, in March 2016 the Chinese government began to crack down on borrowing from Shadow Banks for real estate deals. How effective will this crackdown be? We'll have to wait a few quarters to have an answer. 

Another source of bubble worry comes from Chinese State Owned Enterprises (SOEs). These either partially or wholly state-controlled companies have the backing of the Chinese government, and great access to debt capital from large, Chinese banks. These government relationships allow certain Chinese companies to amass large amounts of debt and stay in business when free-market forces would otherwise run them out of town on a rail. These propped up companies, often referred to as “zombie companies” in the Western media, have begun to lose out in profits. It’s only a matter of time before the Chinese government is forced to either prop up the companies with more debt or consolidate them. [Figure 2]( http://imgur.com/LbJCnFP)

**3: Opinions Are Like…**

So how does this all come together? What does this all mean?
When it comes to China, we’re dealing with an economic beast that has never been seen before. The question for most analysts is not *IF* we will see the Chinese economy unravel, but &amp;*WHEN* we will see the emperor’s bare ass. 

So far, the Chinese government has done a fairly good job at keeping everything together, however much of their action has been reactionary rather than proactive. President Xi’s recently announced “supply-side plan” aims to reign in the Chinese economy, restructure to no longer depend on raw industrial power for growth, and limit the issuance of debt. This plan aims to give China’s economy a soft-landing and save the country from fiscal disaster and global humiliation. If it all goes according to plan that is…

**4: All it Takes is One**

I believe in human greed. I believe in human fear. I believe both of these fundamental psychological forces will be the undoing of China’s economy.

If lenders find a way to make money, they will lend. China’s government will not be able to completely control access to capital through shadow banking and p2p lending, there will simply be too much demand for capital. Real estate developers often have the mind set their project is different, that it will weather the storm and be successful, even if everyone around them is failing. This same mentality will cause Chinese investors and companies to throw good money after bad if things really start to slip.

Right now, international investors are fearful. When they see the house of cards falling in China they will pull out faster than… never mind. 

The Chinese central government can only keep dancing and reacting so long to keep the first domino from tipping. They have been successful so far, which leads me to believe they could continue to prop up the economy for a while. However, one slip up and the whole thing could unravel with the government having little power to intervene. A “black swan” event is something no one sees coming, all it takes is one catalyst to collapse what the Chinese government has worked so hard to build.

**5: C’mon Ride the Train!**

So my friends, how do we cash in?

A position I have recently taken is amassing shares of **EEV**. 

EEV or ProShares UltraShort MSCI Emerging Markets is a (-2x) inverse ETF of the daily performance of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.

Why do I like EEV better than China specific short ETFs? Diversity. EEV has a 19% exposure to China. Shockwaves in slowing Chinese growth have already been passed on to its poorer Southeast-Asian neighbors who are also represented in EEV. I see EEV as covering more ground in the event of a smaller scale Chinese economic downturn than FXP or CHAD.  

From a technical standpoint, EEV is a buy. It looks like we have a reversal on our hands.

http://investor.sophirisbio.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=975147

&gt; SAN DIEGO and VANCOUVER, British Columbia, June 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Sophiris Bio Inc. (NASDAQ: SPHS) (the ""Company"" or ""Sophiris""), a biopharmaceutical company developing PRX302 (topsalysin) for the treatment of urological diseases, today announced the biopsy results from all 18 patients enrolled in the Phase 2a proof of concept study of topsalysin in localized prostate cancer. The one-time administration of topsalysin was well tolerated with no serious adverse events and no new safety signals being reported. Topsalysin demonstrated an ability to ablate tumor cells in 50 percent of patients (9/18 patients) six months after treatment in a patient population with pre-identified, clinically significant prostate cancer. The results support advancing topsalysin into a Phase 2 study to confirm dose and optimize delivery.

&gt; ""These promising early results open up the possibility of treating early prostate cancer by the simple administration of an injection into the prostate - something that could be done in an office setting,"" according to Dr. Mark Emberton, Investigator, Dean, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University College London and Honorary Consultant Urologist at University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.  

&gt; All 18 patients enrolled completed the study. Biopsy data at six months following treatment showed that:

&gt; Two men experienced complete ablation of their targeted tumor with no evidence of any tumor remaining at 6 months;
    Seven men experienced a partial response, defined as either a reduction in the maximum cancer core length or a reduction in Gleason pattern;
    Nine patients had no response to treatment.

&gt;""It was impressive to observe complete tumor ablations in this proof of concept study. We have demonstrated that topsalysin can safely ablate prostate tumor cells, so these responses increase our confidence that topsalysin could obviate or prolong the time to the need for radical therapy in this patient population,"" stated Dr. Hashim Ahmed, Principal Investigator for the study, Division of Surgery and Interventional Sciences, University College London. ""With the experience from this study, we believe we can further improve responses by optimizing dosing topsalysin based on the size of the tumor and not the prostate and optimizing the delivery of topsalysin, which we will confirm in a larger Phase 2 study."" 

tl;dr 50% success rate for early prostate cancer with a simple injection that can be done in an office setting.

16-06-09,4ndiqd,I have $3 million in assets and need to completely revamp my investments. Help!,"I have read all all the sidebar information, but didn't find anything that directly relates to my situation. I didn't get a windfall of money and need to invest; I have a corporate job as my primary income and have diligently saved my entire life. My porfolio is way too risky and I need to diversify and create a long-term plan instead of ad-hoc investing like I have historically.



**Here are relavent details:**

* I am 36 years old, married with 3 kids and live in Canada.

* My take home salary is about $110,000 per year and my expenses are about the same as well.

* I get paid variable pay mostly in stock which is about $350,000 per year after taxes.

* I have a high risk tolerance. I have never sold an equity position through the ups and downs of the market.

* I don't spend any time reviewing my investments. I wish I was more interested in investing theory/practice, but my actions have demonstrated it's not in my blood.



**Assets:** $3.3 million

* After tax equities: $1,750,000 (90% energy stocks)

* Before tax equities: $530,000 (100% energy stocks)

* Real Estate: $900,000

* Cash: $100,000


**Goals:**
I want to diversify and re-allocate my assets. I hope to have enough passive income so I have the option to retire in 10 years

**Questions:**
I'm am struggling to decide if I hire a financial advisor and pay 1.5% to 2% or just manage my own portfolio with a [Lazy Portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Lazy_portfolios). What are you thoughts?
What kind of asset allocation split do you think I should have?

Heres the buying selling history from Wikipedia:

""In 1982, the company moved its headquarters from Hollis, Queens, to Harmon Meadow, New Jersey. It was sold to CBS Toys later that year for c. $58 million.[3]

In 1987, CBS sold Ideal to Viewmaster International, which renamed itself View-Master Ideal in the process.

In 1989, View-Master Ideal was bought by Tyco Toys of Mt. Laurel, New Jersey for $43.9 million.[11] The Ideal line remained part of Tyco until Tyco’s merger with Mattel, Inc., in 1997.

Ideal's United Kingdom assets were sold to Hasbro, which has since released Mouse Trap and KerPlunk under its MB Games brand. Other toys that originated with Ideal continue to be marketed and sold by other companies, including Rubik's Cube by Hasbro and Magic 8-ball by Mattel.

The Ideal brand was revived by Plaza Toys on its Fiddlestix building sticks products, but by January 2011 was a Poof-Slinky brand.[12]""",10

- Where could you get the data from?
- How could you set it up?
- What qualifications would you need?
- How could you maintain the site?
- Do you think R/Investing could set up a discount online brokerage? 

EDIT:

Just for more clarification I'm thinking perhaps a more brick and mortar/startup brokerage firm such as

https://www.robinhood.com/
https://www.degiro.co.uk/
https://www.idealing.com/
Perhaps Etoro also?

I suppose it would be pretty interesting to see how basic or how advanced you could make the broker business model.

For example how about a completely stripped down, no thrills, no commissions, no advice broker as opposed to a fully fledged and analysis driven broker experience.

What would it take to achieve the bare minimum to be a broker then perhaps advance upon that is what I'm asking in either the US or the UK

Also Nike pays dividends and UA doesn't pay dividends. Nike also had a 2:1 split I think about 1 year ago. So even if you say, ""Oh, Nike only pays like a dollar in dividends every year."" With only 100 shares in Nike after a 2:1 split equals 200 dollars in dividends alone. I'm all for UA and I hope they succeed as a company as they have had a rough 2 years. But you have got to look at the sheer size of the market and when Nike's shares cost around 50 a share and UA costs around 37 a share and Nike has handsome dividends and UA has no dividends and Nike has had a 2:1 split in the last year,; I mean as an investor.... you gotta keep emotion out of decisions.

16-06-10,4ng0zk,Life turned upside down - lost 75K - need to tell someone. Yes I know I am an idiot.,"I have always been a smart, frugal, reserved, and cautious person. I never in my life would I have thought that I would be someone telling a story like this. However, due to my stupidity, emotions, and overconfidence, i lost 75K in a matter of months. I have nobody to blame but myself.

I just want to tell this story to someone, in hopes that I can start getting over this massive depression.

This 75K was part of the proceeds from my home that I sold late last year, and represented most of my net worth. Ive since got married and moved into a condo (renting). Since we had no immediate need for the large sum of cash, I had the bright idea of investing it in hopes of making a few extra bucks. I mean, it takes money to make money, right? Some extra money on the side to help us if we decide to have kids and the wife is out of work for a while.

So i went ahead and did it, on my own, my wife having zero knowledge. I wont get into details, but I invested in a company I thought was stable, and doing all the right things. Yes yes, I know, diversify! All that good stuff. I know. I ignored that. Unfortunately the stock price didnt agree, and after some dips, crashes, recoveries, etc. I ended up trading my way into oblivion. Yes it was volatile, and I thought my put hedges would protect me from downside risk, but due to my emotions, and large downwards moves, it wasnt enough. 

For the last several weeks, I have had the following emotional and physical consequences:

- I have dropped 10lbs (im sure a lot is water) due to not 
eating/no appetite. 

- I have gotten minimal sleep

- I have a constant tightness in my chest and headaches.

- I cannot stop thinking about how much i fucked up and how 
much I have set back my family.

- I used to exercise daily, I havent done any of that in weeks.

- I am clearly not happy at all and have no ability to truly enjoy myself or be myself. I have to pretend to be happy when I am out with friends/family/wife, and im sure I am doing a shitty job.

I have learned a lot. Looking back I ask myself, why did i do it if things were fine? I had a decent/steady job, i had money in the bank, I was happy with my life, and I loved everyone in it. I could have just let it sit in an account and just go through life a half step ahead and just enjoyed it. But instead, thoughts of extra money started popping into my head, and the things that we could do with it. I chased the dollar when I didnt need to, and I paid ever so dearly. I learned I do not have the emotional strength to invest. I would watch my investments daily, almost constantly. I would get upset, I would get happy. I couldnt sleep. I couldnt concentrate. 

So what is my gameplan now? Well, I know in the long run I can recover, but this is a significant blow to our wealth. First and foremost, ive transferred whatever I had left in my trading account back into our bank account, and put in a request to close the trading account. In the short term, I am looking for a job to do on the weekend, and maybe some night work. I am going to sell my PC for some extra cash and sell my car and buy a cheaper one. I also have to gear up to explain this to my wife at some point, but I need to get a plan together first and start executing on it before I tell her.

Any way, its been nice to actually type this out. I feel a bit better believe it or not. I know in the long run I can recover. I just need to get through this extremely depressing time in my life. This is extremely uncharacteristic of me, and I cannot believe it has happened. Please be smart and dont let it happen to you.

With bonds, I realize you face two principal risks:
*interest rate risk - NAV of bonds decreases increases when market interest rates increase.
*inflation risk - inflation eats into real returns and decreases purchasing power of the funds received upon maturation.

Using past performance to predict future results is certainly a fallacy in equities (although this engenders a discussion of both the utility of historical results for planning purposes as well as the choice of time horizon for ""future results"").

Looking at the Morningstar charts, I feel like I'd be a damn fool not to have assets allocated in the long-term bond fund given that I can weather interest-rate risk with my relatively long time horizon and the historical performance of long-term funds (with consequentially higher yields). However, this decision *also* appears to be returns-chasing behavior for what might well be an over-valued asset.

 **My question(s):** given my dual time horizons, is my decision to have my bond allocation is strictly long-term instruments as foolish as I suspect it might be? Most of the threads I've found using the search bar seem concerned with short-term performance and valuations as opposed to the longer view.",2

16-06-10,4ngrrz,Opinion on SKIS,"I would like some opinion and criticism on the reddit number crunchers out there for SKIS. 

My Speculations for picking up stock earlier in the year-

Posted a poor quarter due to a late start to ski season. Approx 25% of revenue comes from lift ticket sales(not including season pass sales). Revenue during ski season quarters highly volatile based on weather. 

Prior to announcing their Q3 2016 earning reports they announced the introduction of their peak pass(good to all their resorts). If anyone follows the industry they know about Vail Mountain Resorts(MTN) and their Epic Pass(good to all their resorts) that they introduced in 2008. Which now accounts for 40% of their revenue and is the main proponent of their business model. Go see for yourself how MTN has done since 2008. In previous years, SKIS season passes accounted for 25% (+- 3%) of their revenue, it is no secret they will follow in MTN's footsteps as the east coast version of MTN. After one month of peak pass sales they are already up 30% for season pass sales for the same time period last year. Season passes have historically fluctuated for SKIS +- 3% year to year depending on previous ski season length(which was poor this year). So a 30% increase is outstanding. 

Bonus: At the end of May, their EB-5 program submitted in August for a $52 million Mount Snow project received approval. Big win considering Mount Snow is by far their highest revenue producing resort.


Managing Risk -
Can compare opening dates for the coming season, by Mid to late November, to last seasons through OntheSnow.com historical data. Analyst reports that I found last year suggesting a poor ski season were not published until Mid December when the stock price began falling so I think it will be possible to make a buy/sell decision prior to majority.

Management has built and sold several companies with fantastic returns to original investors. One time and startup charges obscure results.

Long term institutional common stock holders control much of the common stock.

The stock is now at an approximately 25% discount to what the institutional shareholders paid.

In the past management sold the company within about five years. The commodity price collapse may have delayed those plans, but it will not cancel them.

In less than two years the company has increased its production by a factor of 7. Operational results of this will appear in the future.",3

I've been hacking my portfolio up into pieces lately, selling off certain stocks in order to do home repairs.  I own 2 homes.  One is a rental and the other I live in.  I consider these long term investments for me, and one of them I'll probably sell in 3-5 years while I hold onto the other.  I realize that I've maybe lost track of the diversification of my portfolio, in exchange for home improvements. 

I could probably have more stable, long term, low maintenance tech stocks but I'm waiting for Google or Tesla to actually be affordable.  I'm long on both of those.  I could probably have more stable long term stocks such as disney, Coke, or GE.

I'm also trying to get out of the Pharmaceutical industry, because it's so news driven, and also because these stocks swing up and down so quickly.  I'm just waiting for Pfizer, Abbott, and Relypsa to go up, but at the same time I'm debating whether Pfizer is a stable company. I'm definitely short on Relypsa.  Come on Bubble, where the fuck are you?

16-06-11,4njajq,Leveraged ETFs Question,"Well hello y'all.
Long-time lurker but first-time poster here.

I see that a lot of you guys use 3x Leveraged ETFs for maximum gain$ and faggotry. I've tried to search these instruments a bit but couldn't find any in-dept info or article about how they work (How are they made? What are the risks associated to the extra leverage? Anybody ever did some analysis on their long-term return potential rather than the intended daily use?)
They also seem to be doomed to go to $0. What I mean here is that if you look at a 3x Bull ETF and a 3x Bear ETF for the same index (ex: UWTI and DWTI), the long-term trend seems to be that the sum of their value goes down (i.e. UWTI went down WWAAYY more than DWTI went up during the last 5 years). If this is the case, what's preventing me from shorting 50% UWTI and 50% DWTI and being profitable in the long term?

I know that these questions probably sound stupid to someone who knows better, but I don't.
Anyway, I was hoping that someone could maybe explain them a bit or point out a website/article with more info about them - you know, so we can understand what we invest in.
I know, I know, I can go fuck myself.

16-06-11,4njehj,"You guys should take a look at Canada's leading Marijuana producer ""Canopy Growth Corp"" (CVE:CGC)","Canopy Growth is Canada's leading medical marijuana producer. Between it's two core brands: Tweed (recreational), and Bedrocan (medical), it has already captured over 20% of the marijuana market in Canada. Please take some time to read over their Financial Statements and MD&amp;A found near the bottom of their website: http://canopygrowth.com/. Already, their medical marijuana sales are growing 35-50% quarter-to-quarter. (NOT YOY) This kind of growth is unheard of, and when marijuana becomes legalized in Canada (mid2017-early2018), expect a sharp rise in sales and market capitalization. At a current valuation of 250M, there is a lot of room for growth.


You should also know that Canada has extremely stringent regulations on Cannabis and it can take a new company over 2 years just to obtain licenses to produce and sell marijuana. Because of this, only 19 companies can currently produce/sell marijuana legally. This means that Canopy Growth (and other Licensed Producers) will be able to capture a large % of the market very early on.


People generally associate the marijuana industry with risk, but I assure you, the Canadian marijuana industry is not a risky bet. In fact, Canada's own minister of finance holds over 8 million shares of Canopy Growth. 


I encourage you all to do some research on this company. The share price is only $2.60 Canadian so you can invest as little or as much as you'd like. ",5

16-06-11,4njl14,"Let's talk about small/microcaps.","I think we should address the stocks that every beginner seems to be losing their asses on: smallcaps!

The stocks I'm talking about are ones with market capitalizations of $1-500MM (generally on the lower end of the spectrum).

Some recent/famous examples are: GEVO, MGT, SUNE, GBSN, AVXL, CLRB, LEU, HART, and more!

Point blank, these are not investments. Pull up any of their charts and you'll see a downtrend with sudden areas of volatility, but that's it. It's fine if you want to throw some money at them, but only an amount that you'd be fine completely losing.

These are trading vehicles only. Capitalize on volatility. In, out. Boom, bam.

Before you even put in an order, though, you need to analyze why the stock is running up and what the company's like.

The most common reason for small cap runs is a PR or filing. With these you need to read between the lines to understand what's really happening. It may seem like positive news, but when you put it in proper context it seems less spectacular.

Take GEVO for example: GEVO was able to fuel 2 Alaskan Airlines flights with their biofuel. Great news! Amazing!

BUT, news doesn't exist in a vacuum.

Their current fuel isn't remotely competitive with conventional jet fuel. Even if they reach full production capacity (which they've been promising for years and seems unlikely) their fuel will still be more expensive than regular fuel. Combine that with analyzing their horrendous financials, an offering yesterday, and over 30M shares in outstanding warrants about to be exercised and you get a better picture of what this stock's future really is.


This was a great company to short once momentum dried up (if you could find locates). People who are still long got killed and are bag holding.

(aside: Probably stay away from shorting small caps if you're new. Risky business that could get you in the middle of a short squeeze.)


At the end of the day, you need to fully understand the situation before you enter a trade. If you don't, you're gambling. Learning how to read filings (8-k's, 10-Q's, etc) and PRs is one of the best ways help with this. 

And for the love of God, please don't buy a stock because it's up a lot on the day. 

**Don't buy a dream, buy a company.**

So we sought professional advice and here's what he advised us to do, looking to /r/investing to verify the pro's advice is sound:
&amp;nbsp;

-Contribute $5500 each (wife &amp; myself) into an IRA. (however we later discovered our household income is over the max amount, is it still worth doing?)

-Invest a minimum of $20,000 (avoids fees, we may do more) into 3 different Blackrock plans

16-06-11,4njyyh,"Is long term stock growth in a stock market equal to that country's real GDP growth plus inflation?","This seems like a truism to me. Stock price growth = GDP growth plus inflation. I looked up the numbers since the early 1900's. Long term stock price growth is around 7% per year. Real GDP growth was 3% per year. Inflation was 4% per year. They seem to add up perfectly. 

Edit: better numbers


Stock returns are 9%. Source: http://observationsandnotes.blogspot.com/2009/03/average-annual-stock-market-return.html

Inflation is 3%. Source: http://www.in2013dollars.com/1900-dollars-to-2014-dollars

https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwIRHCK8UAvgVDlTTXdieWo2OUE

Summary: we know that rebalancing a portfolio annually increases risk adjusted returns by passively buying low and selling high. It also keeps the portfolio risk tolerances in line with long term aims.

The issue: Rebalancing two assets every year is easy enough to calculate when you make no contributions during the year. However, I've noticed that if there are variations the workings are less clear. In the example asset Alpha has decreased in value over the year but dollar-cost averaging means a gain was made on this asset. Asset Beta has increased in value year-on-year but a loss has been made.

Surely rebalancing by selling Alpha and buying Beta is the opposite of buying low and selling high? However if we sold Beta and bought Alpha then our portfolio would be poorly weighted. Any ideas on how to reconcile this paradox?",2

16-06-10,4ni4rq,"Advice about following ""gurus"" online, and the dangers of believing everything you see","This is for the newer investors or traders out there. In regards to following guru's, or certain traders on Twitter/websites/Facebook etc., I wanted to share some of the mistakes that i've made in the past, and my goal is to have any of the newer/less experienced investors use the information going forward.

1. There is an enormous amount of garbage out there on the web. A large amount of websites and traders will claim incredible returns and that they can make you 5%, 10% a week etc. For one, 5% a week is not sustainable, under any circumstances, let alone 10%.

2. Most of these traders post specific trade results, but will not post commissions, or slippage. These two pieces can be VERY significant to returns on a portfolio. Along with that, they do not post pictures of these trades happening in their real money account. If they cannot provide a verified screenshot of the trade happening in their brokerage account, then take anything you read with a grain of salt.

3. Most of these traders have posted enormous returns from 2009 to 2013. This happened directly after the financial crisis, and not to discount anyone on here, but a monkey could have made enormous returns during 2009 to 2010. If you took a portfolio, and highly leveraged it, you would have a nice vacation home on an island in the caribbean. The problem arises in that most people will focus on these enormous returns and expect them to continue to perpetuity. Once again, this is not sustainable.

4. When looking at traders, or guru's, also look at their performance versus an index, as well as compare their performance during drawdown periods. For example, 2008, and 2011 both presented large drawdown periods. If a trader managed to navigate through these time periods unscathed, dive deeper into their results. There is a good possibility that they either A. have fudged their results (for example, I noticed one guru opened a monster hedge in 2011 that basically saved the year...when I say opened, I mean just added to their tracking spreadsheet but never entered the trade) or B. they are using excellent money management techniques. As with anything, exceptions do exist, but be wary.

5. Liquidity. This is a big one, especially if there is a very popular guru. Say someone posts a trade (whether they actually entered it or not, but they feel that there is a reason this trade will be profitable), if someone has 80,000 followers, and all of them were to invest even just a moderate amount of money, it will have an impact. In stocks, it has a potential to move the market, and cause the investors at the tail end to be on the wrong side of the train. This is MUCH more important in scalping and very short term trades. On options, if an influx of trades comes through at once, the bid/ask spread will be purposefully widened to account for the spike in volume. This phenomenon exists, so take it into consideration.

In conclusion, just be very careful about following or tracking online gurus. You will be much better served with an information depot to make your own choices, versus following someone.",4

What do you guys think of ALLY as a value investing play?  I did a bit of due diligence, I see a few things going for it:

1. By the numbers, ally seems to be undervalued (P/B ratio is very low, P/S also seems low). 

2. I read their most recent annual report, they seem to be doing quite well.  Their revenue primarily comes from dealership loans right now (which seems very risky), but they're working on diversifying to retail deposits and other credit products (credit cards). 

3. From a pure product perspective (I'm a software engineer by trade), their site and ui is very nice.  They're iterating / adding new functionality very often, and generally seem to be very nimble. 

One thing going against it is that the EPS seems to be very low (P/E for 2015 was 8.91).

- VTI - 60%

- VXUS or VEU - 30% (can't decide which one to choose)

- BND or BNDX - 10% (can't decide which one to choose)

I am ok with taking a bit higher risks, therefore smaller BND percentage.

I plan this as a long term investment naturally.

I have three questions:

1) VXUS or VEU for international stocks?

2) BND or BNDX for bonds?

3) Should I include REITs, if yes - which ones would you recommend?

4) Would you suggest to simplify the portfolio even further? If yes, how?

16-06-12,4nnzd3,A synthetic Roth IRA in a taxable account without contribution limit,"We like to put out for discussion the following idea, which we implement successfully, but we haven’t seen it talked about anywhere else. 
Important: some people interpret “synthetic Roth IRA” as the back door Roth IRA. Google that term and you will find mostly links on how to fund a traditional IRA and roll it over to a Roth. That’s not what we mean. That back door IRA is still subject to an annual contribution limit of $5,500. What we do has no upper limit!
Our procedure is very easy, almost too easy:
Get leveraged equity exposure, by a factor of exactly 1/(1-marginal tax rate). Realize your capital gains (and dividend income) every year for tax purposes and pay the tax next April 15 (or gain a tax write-off for your losses occasionally). This way the tax basis at the end of the year is exactly identical to what you have in a Roth. And you have easy access to it, no penalties for early withdrawals, no minimum required distributions as in a Traditional IRA, etc.
This is easily implemented through equity index futures, which can be cheaply traded, they have zero expense ratio (but they do require rolling contracts 4 times a year, with a cost probably slightly below the cheapest index ETFs, a few basis points). You can do this on any scale you like. The bigger the better!

We could possibly see a surge in stock price once the Army selects a candidate for contract. 

The contenders are:

Beretta: Private

Glock: Private

Ceská zbrojovka: Private

FN Herstal: Private

Sig Sauer: Private

[General Dynamics](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=general+dynamics+stock): GD

[Smith and Wesson](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=smith+and+wesson+stock): SWHC



Okay, faggot. 5/7 of these are private, what gives? Well, FN Herstal you could almost definitely eliminate due to its 5.7mm caliber that will never fly, Sig is out due to their somewhat poor weapons quality and chances are the US Military would most likely go with an American weapons manufacturer for their default side arm, and the CZ you could pretty much eliminate as well because lets face it, the US Army *probably* wont go with a Czech weapons manufacturer.

So that leaves 4, of which two are public. I'd eliminate General Dynamics based on their lack luster weapons platform history - they probably wont be a contender.

So what are we left with you ask? Beretta, Glock, and Smith and Wesson, and seeing the Smith and Wesson is the only public contender left. I think it's quite obvious who to buy in to.

16-06-12,4nqltr,How I traded HMNY Which Moved 1500%,"This week the market came back swinging sending S&amp;P 500 all the way back to the all time high reached in May 2014. The unusual side of things is that the jobs number for May came out last week and it was significantly below the projection. Normally this would be bad but in this backwards market fueled by artificially low interest rates, it sent the market back to the highs. This is because market participants thought that the federal reserve would be less likely to raise interest rates at their June meeting which means the market has more room to run. After 6 up days in a row the market finally pulled back Friday following a sharp sell off in Europe and the emerging markets which got slammed over 2% on Friday.

The move higher in the market really doesn’t make much sense (I think we are headed for a recession in the next year), but the fact is as a trader, I don’t care where the market is headed. All I care is that it goes some place so I can jump in and out and extract consistent profits. When it doesn’t move anywhere then we have a problem, but the great part about the market is that their is always an opportunity at any given time. Even in the summer months when the volatility is usually lower, you still can get many trades in the morning. The key to zeroing in on these opportunities is to get an end of day or real time scanner which will allow to find every stock that is moving at any give time. By filtering out all the low volatility stocks that have no means of providing you a profitable trade, you increase your chance of success significantly. By avoiding the low volatility times of the day you also increase your odds of success by reducing the chance you get stopped out on a trade.

This is how I found the penny stock Helios and Matheson Analytics Inc (HMNY) this week. Man oh man this was an awesome stock to trade. It’s not every day that you see a penny stock go from $1.00 to $17.00 but that’s what happened with this low float huge gainer! I won’t say this is a rare occurrence because I have seen it happen numerous times in my 14 year trading career but you don’t always get multiple opportunities like I did with HMNY. I was able to extract ten’s of thousands by simply finding the stock early and jumping in and out. By not being greedy I literally was about to win dozens of times on this stock in the past 3 days. I was even able to pinpoint the top by simply looking at my trading system and finding the optimal time to get rid of my long position. This isn’t rocket science. Anybody can do once they know how to find these stocks, when to enter, where to places stops and when to take profits. Having a plan is the most essential part of trading successful and a lack of a plan is why so many people end up big fat losers in penny stocks.

An interesting theme right now is that a lot of these low priced junk penny stocks are making 50 – 1500% moves in minutes or hours. Normally at the end of a big bull market as we have had for the last 7 years here in the US, the small and micro cap stocks are the last stocks to really move. This is because all of the mid and large cap stocks have already made there moves and are fairly valued or over valued, and the lower priced stocks which have no intrinsic value, are all that is left. It doesn’t really matter whether the companies have earnings or not because traders only care that the company has a catalyst.

It seems like one of the most common issues for a young investor.  They throw some money into the market (401k, Roth IRA, Build Wealth, etc...), and they constantly check it and consider pulling out on a market drop.

For example, I just put $15,000 into a diversified (80% stock, 20% bond) ETF portfolio with Vanguard.  Last week, my portfolio dropped $300 and I started to second-guess myself about investing in the market while it's at these highs.  I invested with the idea that it is better to put my money in NOW versus waiting and trying to time the market.   But I invested with the addage, ""time is on my side"" so I am not too concerned.

Editors notes below:

&gt;“We also see that, historically, cash has averaged a total return of about 0.28% in “normal” months and 0.24% in Crisis Alpha months.  The attribute of having a positive return in Crisis Alpha months provides fantastic diversification to a stock portfolio. Moving on to bonds, we see that historically bonds have provided a 0.21% excess return over time and have had a positive excess return in 56% of all months.  In “normal” months bonds have provided a 0.22% excess return and had a positive excess return 56% of the time.  In Crisis Alpha months, bonds provided a 0.12% excess return and had positive excess return 56% of the time.""

*(Or, how I learned to stop worrying and love the liquidity trap)*

&gt; 1)Bonds do provide some diversification benefits – they provide positive excess return in Crisis Alpha months 2)However, the diversification benefit of bonds may be smaller than people realize – bonds have produced a positive excess return only 56% of the time in Crisis Alpha months (no more frequent than in “normal” times) and they have only provided an excess return of 0.12% in Crisis Alpha months (compared with 0.22% for “normal” months).

I bought a place 3 years ago as my first house with the long term goal of renting it. I initially fixed it up then lived in it with roommates up until now. My market has recently gone crazy and I've learned I could sell for 285ish while currently owing about 140ish (original purchase price was 165), OR I could rent it out and make 500-600/month. The market is north denver suburbs.  

What are some things worth considering? At the end of the day I just want to make sure my money is working hard for me and it seems like (1) the time it would take for me to make that 100k renting it out that I could get selling would be a while, (2) while the equity build is nice there is obviously risk in having a rental property including normal wear, and (3) while nobody knows for sure, I feel a market correction in Denver has a good possibility on the horizon (but again maybe not).

On Friday I began to feel a bit nervous as I saw a red day for SWHC but after hearing of the mass shooting I decided to do some research on the correlation between mass shootings and the rise in gun stocks directly after. Here are the articles that cover most of the recent mass shootings in the last few years: http://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/jun/22/gun-sales-profits-stocks-shootings-moral-investing http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/07/business/after-mass-shootings-some-on-wall-st-cash-in-on-gun-shares.html http://money.cnn.com/2015/10/05/investing/gun-stocks-surge-2015/ http://www.mytwintiers.com/news/american-gun-stocks-at-record-high-despite-recent-mass-shootings https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/02/two-gun-makers-stocks-jumped-after-the-san-bernardino-shooting/ https://theintercept.com/2015/12/03/mass-shooting-wall-st/ http://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/05/reuters-america-trading-algorithm-shows-how-mass-shootings-politics-boost-gun-shares.html http://www.cnbc.com/id/100321785  I also checked out the charts on SWHC and verified the prices correlate directly to around the time of the shootings. SWHC saw a surge in December 2015 from 18 to  nearly $25/share after the San bernadino shooting and calls for gun control.   Goodluck and happy trading. Perhaps if we all do well we can donate a small portion to those affected by this tragedy. Stay safe guys.,42

16-06-13,4nvtq1,Real DD: Short WFM,"I'll show you why from a corporate strategy perspective WFM isn’t 100% on point and will be adding the “365” stores too slowly, look at the chart to see a good entry point, and then pick some options to put your money in.

**Corporate Strategy context**

a.	Historically, WFM is a high margin business, but has been facing competition on many fronts (i.e., traditional grocers moving into organic, WMT &amp; TGT growing their grocery business) causing it lose business.  Bad publicity - causing it to be known as Whole Check – also contributed to this.  They are weak in product selection once you leave the organic food categories.  If you want coke (the drink) you’ll have to go elsewhere

b.	OTOH, visiting their stores is a positive experience and the staff is very friendly and goes out of their way to help.  The prepared food section is a driver to get people in the door and a key strength of the chain



**Corp Strategy going forward**

a.	New strategy is to launch the “365” stores that are ~ 2/3 the size of the current stores, staffed by about ½ the # of people and integrate local, 3rd party experiences in the “Friends of 365” concept (e.g., eateries, tattoo shops [LOL], coffee, tea, etc.)

b.	There will only be about 25% of the # SKUs vs. the original stores


c.	Recent posts indicate the 365 stores will be ~ 20% lower on a basket of goods vs existing stores, but are still nowhere near TGT and WMT


d.	All this leads to controlled costs, but sacrifices the personal experience to achieve share holder friendly higher margins


e.	In sum, reasonable strategy and with tweaks they may strike a balance between margin and experience, but will only stop customers from leaving rather than growing the pie


f.	As it stands with the current 365 growth plans (expected to be 10-20 stores in the next 12-24 months), this is not going to have a material effect on the bottom line any time soon

**Looking at the chart: http://i.imgur.com/2PUdSct.jpg**


a.	I marked up a ~ 1 yr chart using tradingview.  You can see the periodic nature of the price


b.	It’s about to take a leg down IMO based on the above fundamentals and its historic performance


c.	Earnings are due out on July 27th .  You can see from the last two earnings dates that WFM took a leg up after earnings.  I’m exiting my position before earnings


d.	This gives us about 6 weeks and defines the exit point

**Picking an option**


a.	Short term Options are mostly liquid. I’ve provided a general exit point and a direction


b.	I’m buying puts.  Alternatively, a cheaper &amp; capped gain strategy would be put spreads


c.	IV constellation via OptionsHouse http://i.imgur.com/6mXNu3D.jpg.  I like the July 22nd because of the very low IV and its pre earnings


d.	Options chain for the July 22 contracts http://i.imgur.com/dHdvSLT.jpg has pretty large bid/asks


e.	Moving a week later, you’ll notice how the bid/ask increases even more for the July 29th contracts http://i.imgur.com/HO6YTLu.jpg STAY AWAY.  I don’t want to pay for IV caused by earnings on the 27th 


f.	July 15th though, looks great from a IV, bid/ask, OI and volume perspective http://i.imgur.com/llMrC41.jpg WE HAVE A WINNER


g.	Given the short term to expiry and bc generally options price starts being overtaken by theta decay three weeks out, I’m inclined to buy the $33 put contract and sell within two to three weeks


I'm long puts.

Donald Trump currently has odds at 3.60:1. This is way, way, wayyyyy too high. $5,000 on him today would return $18,000 in four months, which I think is an excellent return.

16-06-12,4nrrf7,"Short GBP for Orlando, FL gay nightclub terror attack repercussions","* On June 23rd the UK will vote on a referendum to remain or exit the EU.
* While there are many factors involved in the vote, the in/out referendum is largely seen and nationally debated as a single-issue theme: whether British people are willing to accept migrants/refugees as a continuing member of the EU.
* There have been problems of both security and social integration in some parts of Europe -- most notably in Cologne, Stockholm, Paris, Brussels -- with recently accepted migrants of Middle Eastern descent.
* The issue of national security is especially relevant as only about a week ago a cell of ISIS terrorists, some of whom entered as refugees, [were uncovered in Germany](http://www.wsj.com/articles/signs-of-bigger-islamic-state-cell-in-germany-emerge-1465421355).
* Polling on referendum has mostly been 50/50 thus far between the Remain and the Brexit camps. The [latest poll has seen a swing to the Brexit camp](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-referendum-poll-brexit-leave-campaign-10-point-lead-remain-boris-johnson-nigel-farage-david-a7075131.html), though polling data are potentially noisy high frequency data.
* Brexit potential has historically [increased](http://www.politico.eu/article/brussels-attacks-change-brexit-climate-nigel-farage-leave-stay/) after terror related incidents, though the obvious caveat of non-comparability across terror incidents must be emphasized.
* The GBPUSD has historically [depreciated](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/pound-falls-to-8-week-low-on-new-brexit-poll-2016-06-10) in line with the Brexit potential.
* On the morning of June 12th, a US citizen of self-asserted Muslim faith and Afghani parentage, shot people inside an Orlando, FL gay dance hall, killing 50 people and wounding many. The incident has already been labeled as the worst mass shooting incident in US history.
* Very preliminary reporting has linked the shooter in some way to ISIS, either through allegiance or shared ideology.

**Given the above facts, I judge the shooting incident to have a moderate to good likelihood of pushing UK voter sentiment towards the Brexit option. Assuming that Brexit likelihood continues its association with GBP weakness, the trade is to short GBPUSD.**

A bit of argument. The story is very juicy from news outlets' perspectives: carnage, plenty of pictures, a macabre record broken, a clear antagonist, possible links to a broader shadowy organization, and even a smattering of moral comeuppance by Judeo-Christian standards and traditional views against homosexuality. In other words, there's something for everyone here. For people who just like to see some blood, this news story fills that demand. For the intellectual Oxford types who like to ponder on the weighty narrative of East vs West or Religion vs Modernity, this fills that demand. In this light, the new outlets have a natural incentive to push the story hard for the full news cycle.

Meanwhile, politicians may be relied on to act like politicians. For the Brexit camp, they just received a new batch of ammunition; with such a short fuse until the vote, expect them to take a use-it-or-lose-it mentality with the news, which would further feed the news cycle dynamics.

Many are talking about the US domestic gun issue as as possible play on the political backlash and the resulting, if now muted, handgun demand reaction. While that play has certainly worked in the past it seems like mechanisms as less potent, now that successive mass shootings have failed to bring about any substantial challenges to gun ownership.

Ok, here's the deal - I'm long $BAC and have been for a number of years (so I've got a very healthy profit on it).  I don't particularly love it, but I'm not paying a lot of attention to the market these days and I don't have anything more useful to do with the cash at the moment. 

So I'm debating between:

* Just continue to sit on it until I start more actively investing again
* Sell it off now (market order) and just take whatever I can get ($13.83 at the moment)
* Sell it on a limit order around $15-$16 and hope it fills sometime in the next few months
* Sell covered calls and try to make a few bucks while I'm holding on to it (I have options access in my brokerage but I haven't really done any of the research behind how to use options, other than reading about basic strategies like covered calls).

This is in a taxable account, so I'll incur long-term cap gains taxes if/when I sell.

Obviously the right answer is - ""what's in line with your financial plan?"" Of course, if I had that all figured out then I wouldn't be asking this question :)

I guess what I want to know is - if you wanted to unload BAC, how would you approach it today?",1

[Here's some fine print](https://www.myconsumers.org/documents/TIS_Share_and_Drafts.pdf)

You must make 12 credit transactions per months and spend atleast $1000 per month through those credit transactions to receive 4.59% at a max of $20,000.  If you only spend $999.99-$500, you will get the rate of 3.59% at a maximum of $15,000, and if you spend less than $500 the rate will be 3.09% at a $10,000 maximum.

It seems like a lot of hoops to jump through and $1000 is a lot to spend each month, but it is potentially more beneficial compared to the Lake Michigan Credit Union checking account which is 3% at a $15,000 maximum.

I was wondering if you could help me on my Roth.

I have a Roth on my own that I started earlier this year, I wanted to be aggressive so I initially invested 3k into the vanguard Heathcare fund. I didn't get to deposit the max due to a family reason but this year and every year thereafter I will. I would like to diversify as well, but stay aggressive, this year I want to max the Roth with the vanguard total stock market fund or the vanguard 500. Next year I would like to add the vanguard REIT fund as well. Slowly I want to add  4-5 funds in the Roth and 1-2 bond funds. The over a period of time allocate the percentages to 80-20 and rebalance every year thereafter. I am only 27 right now and my job is stable.

16-06-13,4nuefz,New to investing. Need extra info on Index funds,"I've done a very moderate amount of research reading various blog posting and watching videos from many different websites, and honestly I still feel like I'm lost. However I have decided an option that I will be taking is the Index Fund route to pool my money for the long term.

After much consideration from reddit and various other online opinions I have decided that Vanguard will be the company I go to based on their lower costs in comparison to their competition. However one thing is I am currently not able to work all year. I go to college and while I'm at college my amount of hours i work is a lot less. I have about 800 dollars coming from a bond from awhile back, 1,000 dollars so far in savings, and a job that will most likely get me another 750 after other expenses that I must pay by the end of the summer. So all in all I'll be a little shy of 3 grand depending on how much hours I can get with upcoming job opportunities. 

One thing I see a lot is a bit of conflicting information. Obviously I know I need to have a certain amount of money to buy into an index fund but one place I read 3,000, Vanguard's website says 10.000, while I hear up to 50,000 buy in. 

So here are my questions

Using Vanguard what index fund should I buy? 

Is there an amount I have to put into it after the initial buy in or could i deposit sparingly?

I do want (of course) to have some shorter-term investments and returns, but that is after I have my long-term plans in place for retirement and the like. 

So, as I understand it, the only real cons for an EIA are if you need the money now. I am 33 and not looking to retire anytime soon. It looks like a good solid slow build sort of nest egg would work and EIA's seem to have the safety and stability that I am looking for, plus there is the advantage of the tax benefit. Am I missing a con that should be a factor in my decisions? ",1

16-06-14,4nz75e,New investor looking for strategy tips,"Just as background (not a discussion topic, I see rule 4), I got started trading 3 weeks ago using Robinhood with the intention of trying to **mostly swing trade, occasionally day trade if a good opportunity arises and won't flag me as a pattern day trader, as well as hold a few long positions**. I'm aware of the many complaints about its lack of performance and features, but so far, they haven't been a hindrance to me buying and selling when I want (other than access to smarter order types, I suppose). For a while, it seemed to be going pretty well overall, but the last 3 days have been [really rough](http://imgur.com/QBAeD4u), relatively (key word, I know it gets much worse), and I was hoping to get some tips on my strategy, particularly on discovering companies to watch.

Despite my untrained eyes, I've had a pretty good grasp on fundamental analysis thanks to Khan Academy and Investopedia, and while I could dig a bit deeper into fundamentals, I don't think that's a *big* part of my problem. Over the weekend, I vastly improved my grasp on technical analysis, thanks to the friendly reddit user who does [The Active Investor](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqT84mLVw4ZtqmcuxjJ39fw). I've got a TradingView chart set up [like this](http://i.imgur.com/R0Vnkrj.png), with moving averages, weekly (purple) and monthly (pink) Fibonacci pivots, MACD and RSI, which maxes out my free 10 indicator limit. The chart definitely makes me at least feel more informed so far, and looking back at the past few weeks, I see a lot of places where it would've been pretty helpful to have. 

**What feels like my biggest *hurdle* right now is trying to find companies to analyze. I've got a growing watchlist, but most of it has been companies I'm interested in (mainly tech and biotech, where my background is) or have seen pop up in news on Yahoo Finance and RobinHood as companies to watch, but none of them have proven particularly interesting thus far. Similarly, I think my biggest *problem* is gauging market sentiment, both in regards to specific companies and as a whole.** For example, recently I've read about the job report and speculation regarding the federal reserve rates, which has seemed to weigh on a lot of the market, but I have no idea how little or much that might've affected my recent holdings.

I'd love some recommendations to take a look at, but it'd be even better to have some better tools to do it on my own. **I've looked into the FDA catalyst trackers for clinical trials, but I'm not sure what other kinds of tools are out there. I've never been one to seek out business or finance news, so I feel like I'm missing out on a lot of potential by not having less sensationalized, more reliable and up to date sources to gather ideas from. If anyone could give their two cents on the current state of the market with the pending federal reserve decision, that'd be much appreciated, as I've only come across very sensationalized articles so far.**

For what it's worth, I've already got stop losses placed a little below support levels for everything, so I don't expect to lose too much more, but I'm starting to question the potential for gains. With my job, I only really get 10 minutes at 10 and 3 EST to take a break where I can look at the market, plus lunch, so I don't get as much exposure to analyzing the markets and keeping up to date as I'd like. Fortunately RobinHood supports Android Wear, so I can keep an eye on things from my wrist and step in if needed, but **I'm still interested in other platforms, particularly if they have order types that can be leveraged to counter my limited exposure time during actual trading hours. I'm comfortable with the idea of things going in the red, but just want to cover my bases to make sure I'm not doing anything foolish. I'm having trouble deciding whether I want to stay diversified into some of the ETFs below, or if I should use that money to focus on more calculated moves.**

**Any suggestions on how to plan for a dollar value to place a sell order at would be very helpful as well. I'm thinking maybe near resistance, but then you lose out on the potential of it breaking right through, at least with RobinHood's order types, I'm not familiar with the way more I know are out there.**

**TL;DR** - I'd appreciate if you read the bold.

My current holdings, shares, total return, and reasoning (correct me if I analyzed poorly):

Ticker | Shares | Total Return | Reasoning
------|------|------------|---------
INTC | 2 | +1.24 | solid company, liked fundamentals, upcoming processors and mobile opportunites
ATVI | 10 | -7.38 | solid company, some personal bias, high hopes for Overwatch and WoW Movie
AAPL | 5 | -3.92 | solid company, liked fundamentals, bought when cheap hoping WWDC would boost it, but hasn't yet
BIIB | 3 | -27.42 | solid company, liked fundamentals, sold before poor trial result then bought back in thinking it had leveled off before I knew to use pivots
XBI | 5 | -14.06 | wanted a broad exposure to biotech, liked over IBB
GILD | 3 | -5.73 | saw them described many places as promising, liked fundamentals
NVDA | 1 | +0.19 | solid company, hoping for more boost with new GPUs, many lucrative long term prospects, would've been all over them had I gotten in the game earlier, but was leery of buying after seeing their recent big jump
HYD | 3 | +0.39 | diversification, low volatility, dividends
HYMB | 2 | +0.96 | diversification, low volatility, dividends
IVV | 1 | -2.98 | diversify, broad exposure
UGLD | 1 | +0.27 | diversify, stupidly chased on Friday
ABX | 3 | -0.33 | diversify, stupidly chased on Friday
LPCN | 5 | +1.25 | FDA catalyst tracker, hoping for good results, near its low
QRVO | 1 | -0.04 | positive sentiments, looked promising, liked technical
AMD | 5 | +0.10 | upcoming GPUs, seem to be turning around and finding their niche, liked technical
RWR | 1 | -0.25 | diversify, decent technical

16-06-13,4nxo7p,Shitty DD: Buy $CMG puts or calls (or both) prior to the release of May sales,"CMG has been fading lower over the past two weeks due to overall market weakness, some downgrades, some surveys that show people don't love CMG anymore, etc.

The next big catalyst will be May sales #s, expected to be reported any day now.

Management is taking its good old time to report this, i'm guessing because there might be some positive blip in the trend right now so they'll try to spin it as ""May was down 22%, but the 8th to 14th day of June was only down 13%, so we're really totally finally seeing a turnaround guys.""

If there is a legit turnaround, expect a quick pop to $430+ since the stock has been weak lately.

If there is no turnaround, expect a quick drop to $350.

If there is no news release, expect continued downward pressure.

Buying a weekly straddle probably has a good chance of being profitable.

So i'm going to recommend the most /r/WSB thing ever and say go with your gut / go with what you've seen at stores around you lately. NYC actually seems to have perked up a bit lately but still fuck CMG so i'm keeping my puts. 

(I had 2 Jun 17th $410 puts bought forever ago - sold one today at breakeven and holding one more for the next couple of days. I rolled over into two new September puts at a lower strike today.)",0

That being said, what types of features do you think will be useful for such an application? As novice investors, the features we could think of would include: 
 
* Providing stock news and indicating which news caused the change in price 
* Providing several technical analysis tools and indicate when would be a good time for selling/buying 
* Comparing the stock in your portfolio against the index/other stocks in the same sector
* Provides interactive user interface that explains how certain analysis are done 

Are these features reasonable enough, and what other features would really improve such an application? Our greatest challenge thus far would be retrieving the relevant historical and financial data, but we would we like to see what are the possibilities that we can achieve, before we decide if its worth buying the required data.

I think apple will buy tesla because it is the best company around that will allow them to enter a new market area, and has the automotive structure of a tech company. This is a hunch, but if apple is at all worth its share price it would be dumb of it not to purchase TSLA for 30-35 Billion. I don't think TSLA despite poor delivery on vehicles has a completely fucked future and Elon has demonstrated interest to sell and apple has demonstrated interest to buy before.

16-06-14,4o3uwe,AVEO - flying under my radar till now,"I've known about this company for a little while now, but it wasn't until recently when a successful day trader guy I know alerted me to this company's upcoming catalysts.  Now, I have to say that this company has been left for dead, following an infamous FDA rejection of their lead drug candidate, tivozanib (for renal cell carcinoma), in 2013.

However what I didn't realize was that they've succeeded in trials for European regulatory agencies and in the process of filing their versions of NDAs for them.  Most recent corporate presentation is here: http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9MzQxNjYxfENoaWxkSUQ9LTF8VHlwZT0z&amp;t=1&amp;cb=636010807177110864


**First, some key stats**


Current price: 0.97


Market cap: 56m


Shares outstanding: 58m


Cash position: 23.8m


Institutional ownership: 30%


**Technical notes**


Before its FDA ruling, AVEO traded at around $8.  They crashed down to 3 dollars following that and have been declining ever since, settling around the $1 mark.  The 90-cent zone has proven to be a consistent and reliable area of support, however.  It must be said that their cash position alone (due to the payments they have from their European partners) accounts for 40% of that value.  They expect another 40m in milestone payments in the next year assuming the approval process goes smoothly.

**Now, onto the good stuff....**

Tivozanib was the subject of a rather nasty rejection by the FDA, and its case is illustrative of two things - the importance of study design and the fact that the FDA's review boards are by no means composed of expert statisticians.  Tivozanib was initially rejected as a first-line therapy due to the results of the TIVO-1 phase 3 study.  While the study found a statistically significant improvement in progression free survival from 9.1mo to 11.9mo going from sorafenib to tivozanib. ([Slide A](http://i.imgur.com/B7HnabW.png))  However, overall survival (which is an essential regulatory requirement for ""first-line"" therapies) was inconsistent at 29.3/28.8 months.


Now, at first glance, this looks like a clear cut example of failure, but if the FDA had cared to do a little digging, the reason for this discrepancy would have been obvious - patients were allowed to crossover.  Patients who had progressed on sorafenib were allowed to crossover to tivozanib.  This is why by the end of the study, 60% of the sorafenib comparator arm were listed as receiving ""subsequent targeted therapy,"" while only 12% of the tivozanib arm did.  ([Slide B](http://i.imgur.com/ebhMznB.png)) Tivozanib shot itself in the foot by keeping those patients alive after its competitor failed.  It's a sad realization that had AVEO just let all those other patients die instead of allowing life-extending crossover, that they would have had fulfilled the statistical requirements of the FDA.


But I guess that's why we're here talking about this stock as a value proposition.


In rejecting tivozanib, the FDA recommended AVEO to carry out an additional phase 3 study to clarify the overall survival data.  This is ongoing right now, with the endpoint expected in early 2018.  I would not be DDing this stock, though, if the only catalysts were a year away.


**For the near term, we're looking at what's happening in Europe.**


While AVEO is undertaking its new phase 3 for FDA approval, it already has mature data from a followup study that it is using to support their EU filing.  This extended trial has generated statistically significant OS data of 35.9mo vs 31mo ([Slide C](http://i.imgur.com/GoJKLde.png)), and this is why they have been getting overseas partnerships as they are in the process of filing.  As far as the European pharma industry is concerned, tivozanib is coming.  First up is the Russian approval, expected in Q3, followed by the EU approval expected in Q1 2017.  They expect to receive tiered royalties from the high single-digits to the mid-20s together with upcoming cash payments.  With these upcoming regulatory rulings and the US extension study maturing in 2018, and assuming that it passes all these hurdles without issue, we could see an internationally approved drug with potential annual sales of $0.5b.


Of course, I have to reiterate that there are inherent risks of investing in a company that's been written off for dead in the US market.  Companies this beaten down with their market caps a pitiful fraction of what they were in their heyday generally tend not to recover.  But given all the signs of life that are emerging on the European side of things, this company could be one that bucks the trend.  Obviously, the big prize is still the American market, but they are taking positive steps towards this ultimate goal.

     26

    Are you employed/making income? How much?

    Yes, Income 80k-120k

    What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)

    All the above, paid off house, retirement, savings, frugalness with pleasure, hard and fulfilling work hopefully, businesses and peace of mind.

    What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)

    I like good odds bets, for example i just won 18k in Video Poker after doing some simple math and placement.

    What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)

I have funds but non invested except for my 401k

    Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)

I will have 3 properties in my name within the next 2 years or sooner if i decide to refinance them in my name, from my family's property management real estate business. One house with 250k in equity and 289k in mortgage debt at 2% with 1500$ a month payment, the next house at 80k in equity, and the last house with 200k in equity and 150k in mortgage debt with a current Conventional Loan at 4% with 1152$ morgage payment soon to be a VA LOAN.

    What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?

I want to maximize my money, assets, and investments as safe as possible in the next 20years to put it simply.

    Any big debts?

Due to unforeseen circumstances Bankruptcy was discharged in October 2015. After such a life changing event I've turned my life around by saving and now have 35k in checking and savings, 25k in my 401k and no new debt.

I'm open to any advice that may accomplish the aforesaid goals, my current bills per month total to 1500$ and my net per month is 5000$ so far this year after taxes.
If any specifics are needed please ask.

16-06-14,4o1tsd,"Mechanically, how do you begin withdrawing from your IRA when you're ready to?","I have a family member that recently lost his job with retirement benefits.  He has a 401(k) from his old employer and has contacted a couple of financial advisers regarding what he should do with his 401(k) funds.  The family member asked that I take a look at the materials he received, and it's what you would expect.  Actively managed funds, 3.5% up front to the adviser (and/or 1.5% annually, not sure if that annual expense is in lieu of or in addition to the 3.5% up front), along with other fund expenses.

So I'm explaining to my family member that he can just rollover his 401(k) into an IRA (free!), select some index funds and get a better Net ROR over the next 5 years, after which he will retire and begin withdrawing funds.

Now with the actively managed fund advisers, there are no transaction fees to free up cash to withdraw.  Whereas in an IRA, there will be a transaction fee each time he needs cash.  So my question is this: what do folks do who want to withdraw say $1,000/mo. from their IRA?  Sell $12,000 of funds at B.O.Y. so that there is only one $8 transaction fee?  Set up monthly sales?  I'm not near retirement age yet so haven't had to go through this, but I want my family member to not give away more than he has to in fees.  I'm wondering how much these transaction fees add up while you're withdrawing funds and re-allocating your portfolio as you age, and how to minimize said fees.

Any help is appreciated, and obligatory apology if this is in the wrong sub or is handled in FAQ - did not see it there though.",2

My latest tin-foil-hat theory is that WWIII is coming. Look at the [chart](http://i.imgur.com/4zjtLrm.png), you'll see the US has been here before, but it happened a few years before WWII... of course the reasons for WWII don't really correlate to the markets, or do they? According to history, what exactly was Hitler's End Game?

&gt;Hitler's strategy involved occupying Russia's fertile, food-growing land and using it to feed Germans while 'unnutze Esser' -- 'useless mouths', eg Slavs, Jews, socialists/leftists, the disabled, and Central Asians -- starved to death. This was called the Hunger Plan (der Hungerplan) and he expected it to kill approx 25-30 million people, pushing Russia into submission. Germany would claim much of the USSR's land as lebensraum ('living space') and use it to feed their army; Germany wasn't up to fully satisfying its food needs without imports.

So, after this continues and we reenter recession, just like the[ 1937 continued 'depression'](http://i.imgur.com/vpeiDFj.png), similar radical reshaping of political views will occur, followed by increased currency and economic wars, eventually ending in WWIII.

Put down payments for all loans and buy out really low priced housing. Find good deals for people that need fast cash and want to get rid of the property for whatever reason. I am looking for metropolitan cities in growing neighborhoods (Like brooklyn and queens). Maybe do some renovation on each property to increase the value. 

The rent from each house pays out the loan. Simple enough and all I do is scale. 

For months that the property is not rented out, I compensate by the money I have on the side. I know 200k$ is not gonna get me far but I am figuring out how I can borrow more money to make more down-payments. This is a never ending cycle and I hope that within 5 years I will be able to get the cycle stabilized and within 20 years I will have maybe 10-20 houses from which I can just collect passive income.

16-06-15,4o564p,Lets celebrate 9 years of tech bubbles!,"http://blog.samaltman.com/were-in-a-bubble

The post starts with Bubble 2007, by a reasonable post by [codinghorror.com](https://blog.codinghorror.com/welcome-to-dot-com-bubble-20/). And continues with yearly bubble talk until today. Remember people, everyone has predicted 10 of the last 2 recessions!

Now to be fair, it looks like Silicon Valley is beginning to cool down a bit. Unicorns have fallen (Groupon) but overall, the valuations continue to grow. I'm not necessarily saying that the good times will roll forever, but this is a good reminder of how hard it is to actually be a bear (and be correct)",11

Apologies in advance if this has been asked before, I couldn't find it.

I own an S-Corporation of which I am currently the only employee. My tax preparer feels strongly that I need to open a 401k but wasn't able to recommend a provider.

Does anyone have any recommendations on a low-cost 401k plan? Or, any other thoughts on another strategy to invest more than $5500/year pre-tax?

Thanks a bunch.

16-06-15,4o5b5v,The Rite Aid (RAD) buyout is not a rumor,"Walgreens (WBA) is going to buyout Rite aid (RAD) sometime before the year ends, if you want a quick gain you need to hop on before it it follows through. We've all seen how well it worked out for LinkedIn when MSFT bought them out. It might not be a huge gain this time around but there's strong evidence that it's going to follow through. 

http://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2016/06/12/walgreens-finally-cuts-ties-with-theranos/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=yahootix&amp;partner=yahootix&amp;yptr=yahoo

Here's the important quote from that: 

The move by Walgreens was expected as pressure mounted on the nation’s largest drugstore chain. The company’s relationship with Theranos has hurt Walgreens’ image with investors and the public at large as the pharmacy giant is close to finalizing an acquisition of Rite Aid.

1) Brexit fears, if only until the fatadic date, but even if Brexit doesnt happen, which I dont think it will, the damage to the credibility of the euro will be huge.

2) FED interest rate raises in the US. This will destroy the economy.

3) Presidential election fears. Namely, the fear that Trump comes to power.

4) Stocks trading at a higher-than-usual P/E ratio

5) Stocks recovered way too fast, S&amp;P going from 1,800 to 2,100 in something like weeks. Anyone thinks this is kinda weird?

I don't think we'll go down that low, but I easily see the S&amp;P in the mid-low 1900s. I am not going to buy puts and get rekt by time decay again. I am simply shorting SPY.

This price is a bit strange because Microsoft’s purchase price for LNKD is $196 per share. If markets behaved efficiently the current stock price should be at minimum $196.


I can only find two reasons for the discounted current price. First reason, Microsoft is still waiting for regulators to approve the purchase. I can’t see a reason why regulators will block this sale. The business combination is complimentary and I don’t see it causing anti-competition issues. The second reason, Microsoft may not go through with the sale. Given the amount of cash Microsoft has and this being the CEO’s first major purchase I would expect the sale to go through.


Based on this reasoning, I would buy the stock as long as the price is below $196 and set a sell price for when it hits $196. I consider this as almost a risk less trade.

The Ftse100 has just had its 4th straight day in the Big reds, 2% today alone. in the last 4 days lost 375 points or 6%. Other European stockmarkets are bombing: the Cac, Dax, Ibex.   
My dudes, the smart money is getting out. Bond yields on record lows, Gold going up, JPY and CHF up. FFS Soros spent $1bn on gold ETFs this year alone. THE SMART RATS ARE LEAVING THE SHIP.
    
This Brexit bullshit is actually going to happen, do you hear me? The polls are bullshit but they all put Leave ahead by 5 to 10% of the vote. the Betting markets are a better indicator, and they're getting tighter, the odds have gone from 70:30 to 60:40 in the last 24 hours. 'The Sun', a bullshit newspaper for chav twats has come out in support of Brexit, AND THEY HAVEN'T BEEN WRONG ABOUT AN ELECTION OR REFERENDUM SINCE 1974. The prime minister hasn't been seen campaigning or making statements for like 3 days, and I believe he's leaving the leader of the opposition party to do all the campaigning so that they will take more of the fall because he knows that 'Remain' is going to lose.
  
What's going to happen? Immediate sell-offs. all the analyses from the banks, economists etc are almost certainly correct, because everyone will make them come true. I have half my cash in options shorting the pound against the dollar. I am sure I'm not the only one. Then, People will start worrying about a eurozone collapse. China exports to the EU, a lot, the dominos start to fall etc etc. This is going to spread around the world and we have the british public holding the red button under their finger. Have you met the british public? Do you know what they are like? I do. They are going to push that red button and ruin my fucking day. Instant UK recession, I just hope for everyone else's sake that the eurozone pulls together and fucks the UK so hard that none of the little squit countries in the EU fucking dream about stepping out of line and following the UK otherwise the EU is going to fracture like a frozen lake under your fatass momma.

This post is a ~~1 year~~ 10 month update on how accurate my valuations were and whether one would have made money following the results.


Company | Year Ago Market Price | My Fair Value | Trade Type | Total Return
---|---|----|---- | ----
Costco | $145.26 | $105.81 | Short | -7.5%
iRobot | $29.96 | $33.00 | Long | +23.76%
Stratasys | $29.75 | $8.23 | Short | +27.89%
TEPCO | ~~Y~~885 | ~~Y~~1,705 | Long | -30.45%
UnderArmour | $97.93 ($48.96) | $61.86 ($30.93) | Short | +24.04%
Medallion Financial | $8.50 | $9.18 | Long** | -4.7%
Tucows | $23.91 | $26.66 | Long | 0%
T-Mobile | $40.36 | $39.01 | Long | +4.06%
Shake Shack | $71.65 | got a dart board? | Short | +51.69%

**Total Return** on an Equal Weight Portfolio would have been **+9.87%**

the **S&amp;P500 rose +4%** and the **Russell 2000 fell -8.5%**.

So, depending on which index you go by, the above findings **outperformed by 5.5% to 18.3%** even with 3 bad picks

I am looking into VR growth stocks (long hold). Of the following companies: Nvidia, fb, qualcomm, intel, amd, gopro, sony, mircon, applied materials, himax, and elbit, if you guys had to choose 4-5, maybe 6 stocks to invest in (diversify between semiconductors, consumere, hardware, etc), which ones would you choose? 

I have a hard time deciding between established companies and ones that I would want to take a chance/risk on (such as gopro and AMD over Sony and Qualcomm). 

I know that of the list, I will most definitely be choosing fb and nvidia for sure. Don't exactly know what the other 3-4 stocks should be to round out my VR stock MOTIF portfolio.

any advice or insight is greatly appreciated!

1. They rely heavily on Florida travel, so much so that they are usually one of the cheapest airlines going there. The reason for this is Miami hosts one of their largest Hubs in the country.

2. Just playing Disney is risky because you have no idea how much attention the story will have passed today, people's attention is very short. You idiots should know something about that. The Orlando story will be in the news for months to come, people won't be able to forget.

-I'm a single 40-year old web designer in Brooklyn
-I make $130,000/yr, rent is $2200
-I have about $60,000 in managed portfolios and $30,000 in Roth IRA
-I have $20,000 between checking and savings
-I own a house in another state and owe $200,000 over a period of 30 years

So in August of 2015,  an accountant told me I might try being more aggressive at my age and invest in specific stocks. So I did some research and put $8000 spread across Apple, Digimarc, Fitbit and Under Armour. 3 days later was the Aug 24th 'flash crash' and my money went down to $6000. It has stayed there ever since.

So as a pretty conservative person, I'm not sure where to go. I honestly spend zero time researching stocks other than to check prices once a week. I am not the kind to be following the market and buying and selling frequently. I also think I might stink at it, even if I tried to learn more about it.

Should I revisit the stocks I have and reconsider? Or just sell everything and rely on the managed portfolios and IRAs to get me to retirement?",0

I've been watching and trading IDRA for over a year, and have made some nice profits. Since Feb it has really taken a hit, falling from $4 to $1.50 and under. The trading range at the moment is between 1.40 and 1,70. You can make some nice money playing it short term in this range.

This stock is going to hover around these levels for the next 2-3 months, although they have the JPM conference 21st June, so news may spike it, but the key thing is that they have 4 big, big items that are coming end of year / early 2017

1. Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia (WM) A Phase 1/2 clinical trial of IMO-8400 - 

2. Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) A Phase 1/2 clinical trial of IM0-8400 

3. Metastatic Melanoma A Phase 1/2 clinical trial of intratumoral IMO-2125 in combination with ipilimumab (a CTLA4 antibody) in patients with metastatic melanoma is underway. 

4. DERMATOMYOSITIS A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of IMO-8400 in dermatomyositis has recently been initiated to assess the compound’s safety,

Julian Baker of the Baker Brothers sits on the board, and the CEO has guided previous companies to billion dollar buyouts. The CEO also personally owns over $1M of stock bought on open market.

They have another key item in their pipeline, which is the reason the CEO joined the company: Third-Generation Antisense Based on our leadership and scientific expertise in nucleic acid therapeutics, Idera has developed a third-generation antisense platform using gene silencing oligonucleotides (GSOs). - 

Basically if this works out, it will not be a 5x, you'd be looking at 50x. But lets not get ahead of ourselves. 

Idra have stated they have enough cash to see them through to Q2 2017, I expect they'll dilute around this time, but they will not dilute with the SP this low, they'll be pumping it with the results from the 4 trials, where I expect the price to be $6 at least.

I want to invest, and I have been doing a decent amount of reading about it, but I feel like there is so much information out there I don't even know where to really heavily start.

I have only been casually investing up to this point - using apps like Robinhood just to buy stocks here and there, ones that I think will increase in value over the long term.  Nothing serious.

I am looking to do more medium - long term investments, nothing crazy like day trading or something I have to check up on more than a couple times a month.  I opened up an E-trade brokerage account and Roth-IRA account, but I haven't invested into anything yet.

My question is, if I don't have a huge amount of time to dedicate to investing (I have some, but I can't constantly be checking on it), is it still smart to do on my own?  I thought about going the managed portfolio route and trying to go through a bank maybe, but I don't want to pay them a premium and basically make no money from my investments, and I do want to learn.

What should I do?  Continue to do a bit of reading and make some more investments?  I feel almost insecure about making the wrong choices or just blowing my money in the wrong way because I didn't have the right amount of knowledge to be throwing my money in.  Some of the things I was looking into for the Roth-IRA account was some of the random vanguard funds that look pretty safe, as I thought those looked promising, but again I feel like I don't know much.

Does someone have any advice for a guy like me?",19

16-06-16,4oex5a,$GME - Thoughts and Feelings,As a gamer and investor I do see that GME is still generating profits. It is true that digital media is slowly killing off their core business but they are moving into phones/novelty items and other areas. Right now they are close to their 52-week low. They offer a 5.66% Dividend yield which is awesome. The only thing I am not fond of truly is their quick ratio of .60 (I know their current ratio is 1.5 which is great but I prefer the quick ratio personally). I see this as a good moment to invest on the down swing. Am I reading this situation wrong? Anyone else have thoughts on this?,5

They are only valued at $11B despite being a super-big brand, wtf? This is like 10% of MCD and they are 200% better than them.

Higher margins, higher sales, higher growth - to me, at current levels, CMG looks like a no brainer. IMHO it will recover from that small dip quickly and I can easy a pretty fair 100% gain (it only has to go back to its all time high!) in a year or so.

Is this just a case of it ""trading on technicals"" where the price is determined by people randomly drawing lines and not looking at the bigger picture, or is there really something systemic going on that the market knows that I don't?

I'm bullish on the US economy. We're one of the only major economies to not offer negative interest rates on bonds, and I firmly believe we'll see interest rates raised this year, possibly multiple times. People are losing their shit over these interest rate ""hikes"", which are going to be like 10 -20 basis points, at most. It's not going to crater the global financial system to go from .25% to .5%

The US isn't growing at light speed, but it is growing, so I see that at a bullish indicator for the years to come.

Regardless, I'm in it for the long haul. I'm dropping 5k in it as soon as my money is cleared with TD Ameritrade.

16-06-15,4o9zcm,"Court Backs Rules Treating Internet as Utility, Not Luxury","&gt; High-speed internet service can be defined as a utility, a federal court has ruled in a sweeping decision clearing the way for more rigorous policing of broadband providers and greater protections for web users.

&gt; The decision affirmed the government’s view that broadband is as essential as the phone and power and should be available to all Americans, rather than a luxury that does not need close government supervision.

&gt; The 2-to-1 decision from a three-judge panel at the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Tuesday came in a case about rules applying to a doctrine known as net neutrality, which prohibit broadband companies from blocking or slowing the delivery of internet content to consumers.

&gt; Those rules, created by the Federal Communications Commission in early 2015, started a huge legal battle as cable, telecom and wireless internet providers sued to overturn regulations that they said went far beyond the F.C.C.’s authority and would hurt their businesses. On the other side, millions of consumers and giant tech firms rallied in favor of the regulations. President Obama also called for the strictest possible mandates on broadband providers.

&gt; [The court’s decision upheld the F.C.C. on the declaration of broadband as a utility, which was the most significant aspect of the rules. That has broad-reaching implications for web and telecommunications companies that have battled for nearly a decade over the need for regulation to ensure web users get full and equal access to all content online.](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/15/technology/net-neutrality-fcc-appeals-court-ruling.html?_r=0)

** Phase two** All about the technicals. RSI, stochastics, volume. I'll just back test it. OMG holy grail!!

1) Start looking for other strategies - usually technicals.

2) Learn technicals, make a few trades, make some dough.

3) think I know my shit. Go big using technicals. It doesn't.

**Phase 3** If I combine my fundamentals and Technical analysis, I can't go wrong. No one has every done this before!

1) Use fundamentals and technicals,

2)  make a few good trades.

3) go all in, get blown up.

**Phase 4**- options are the key

1) learn about options.

2) make a few good calls with OTM

3) Start averaging down and ignore theta. take a big hit.

**Phase 5** - Get paid to own stock? how can I go wrong?

1) Discover premium and iron condor

2) make a few good trades

3) over leverage. blow up.

As Peter Thiel says, the world is full of secrets and mistaken consensus. This thread is dedicated to contrarian ideas, long and short term, both relating to inflection points and mean reversion. 

My contrarian idea revolves around China:                
Generally western investors are quite skeptical about the country in the long run, various fund managers that I admire (soros, kyle bass) have pointed out at the unsustainability of its corporate debt, its vast shadow banking sector and a chain of trust companies with duration mismatches which will bring it all tumbling down. Some of this skepticism around the short/medium term cycle have carried over to the long term as well. Now ft/economist articles regularly talk about overcapacity, aging population. I am bearish in the next 1-3 years on China but I think the long term trend is in tact. China is following the footstep of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan in its industrialization and it is still at a low base of about USD7-9k per capita GDP, it is very reasonable to believe they will get to 20-30k level over the next 10 years, which will make them by far the largest economy on earth. Many people are skeptical about Chinese entrepreneurship, pointing towards the copycating which was prevalent for the past 20-30 years, giving Japan as an example of a country that caught up to the US and then stopped. I think China will be different for one major reason. 

Although China is demographically/genetically very similar to all the other east asian countries and is the source of most east asian cultures, there is a big cultural difference between the Chinese and Japanese and Koreans, which is a very very high risk tolerance. Chinese people are generally willing to take on much more risks. You see this in the business world, there is the Chinese equivalent of Amazon, Google and Facebook in Alibaba/JD, Baidu and Tencent, while Japan and Korea never developed a formidable tech industry. Chinese companies raised 37 billion in VC capital in 2015, second only to the US at 68 billion, and far greater than any other country. While the Koreas and Japanese went after safe conventional sectors such as cars/shipping, you see China going after new frontiers, some successful (DJI in commerical UAV), some not so (Solar). As a result, I see China's future economic potential as being higher than that of Japan and Korea. Just as the U.S. experienced myriad of recessions/depressions/civil wars and disturbances on its path to become an economic giant, so will China experience turbulence in its climb to the top. ",17

&gt; It’s so big that the company’s valuation is estimated at $1 trillion to $2 trillion; some put the figure as high as $10 trillion. A sale of a 5 percent stake would be the largest I.P.O. ever, with proceeds most likely approaching $100 billion. The investment banker fees may exceed $1 billion, which has prompted a feeding frenzy at this once-in-a-lifetime sale....

&gt; If Aramco lists only on the Saudi exchange, the I.P.O. will swamp the current market capitalization of the exchange, which is $300 billion to $400 billion, and dominate trading. In this environment where the company is the dominant one and is a creature of the state, Aramco can set its own rules on disclosure and other regulation, providing little comfort to foreign shareholders....

So the stats are there, but is it too soon to jump in? The stocks will do well in the long run (airlines are here to stay, we need them as a method of transportation), but I was wondering if they would drop more before rising a lot.

Any ideas?

16-06-16,4ocehy,Why do illegal insider traders get caught?,"Honest question. Why? 
I know I will probably sound ignorant, but how hard could it be to get away with it? Seems easy to me.

Say I work in a large accounting firm, where I am in a position where I have access to non-pubic Price moving information about other companies. I have a friend who has a trading account, so we both collaborate. I will provide the information and dates for specific events, and he will make the trades and split the profit with me.

There are so many creative ways to communicate without getting caught. 

- How about communicating through the deep web? 

- How about using a burner phone?

- How about meeting up, writing the ticker symbol on a cupcake (with icing of course) and giving it to my friend? Which he will then proceed to eat up.

- How about playing an online game together such as COD, and i will proceed to draw the ticker symbol on a wall with my gun.(Shooting the wall and writing letters with the bullet holes)
^^ This could also work with GTA online.

- How about actually communicating through online games like GTA? I doubt the SEC is monitoring your online gaming activities..

- How about just meeting up in a place with no surveillance, such as inside a movie theatre. You could even give him the cupcake in here and eat in inside the theatre. 

Sure they may be suspicious of the trading patterns, but they won't be able to prove it.
Ive read about people going to jail for 18 years because of this!!! 
So either people who get caught are stupid, or I am a very ignorant bitch.

Second part. Longer.

Hi fellows! (We still say that right?) I am just looking for some info on what I can do to retire comfortably. 

I was recommended a Roth IRA by vanguard by a family member, was considering opening one and getting started with the max deposit of 5.5k.

Currently, I am in my second year of college, two more years left before I get my bachelor's. I currently own around 10k in savings, no student debt and scholarships out the whazoo (Heh, ""whazoo"") so I feel secure about these next few years.

What is the risk of investing this early? What can I expect from an IRA? Is it true that I can take out the principal without a fee? And what kind of fees would I expect to deal with over an IRA? Are IRAs given compounding interest monthly or yearly?

And the biggest question, what kind of percentage of a return would guarantee an early retirement? Like, stupid early. Like live off the interest and not work again because work sucks.

The Intelligent Investor &amp; Smarter Investing by Tim Hale. Both books right off the bat suggest that every portfolio should at least have some kind of bonds mixed in. The ratio should be at least 25% bonds and 75% stocks.

At the moment I'm invested in 85% stocks and 15% REIT's and I've made a modest 5-6% return on my investments since April. At the moment I'm using a discount broker that's only available in Europe that only charges £1.75 for UK shares and €0.50 for US shares.

However, with it being a discount broker I don't think it has much selection in terms of fixed investments. Although I'm not entirely sure I will have to contact them via email.

I have read that bond ETF's are a bit hit and miss because if you own a physical bond you can keep track of the coupon rate, maturity and price of the bond individually.

So I'm just wondering where would I go to own some Investment Grade TIPS bonds on a budget? That will guarantee more than or equal to 2% return in the mid to long term? Also if you could give me some advice on some higher risk bonds that would be a decent investment I would also be grateful.

There is no single answer to this question, but we will also need A LOT MORE information if we are to give some sort of answer

* How old are you?
* Are you employed/making income? How much?
* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)
* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)
* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
* Any big debts?
* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.

16-06-17,4ogy5z,Brexit straddle strategy,"if yes brexit estimated move is 1400 pip, at 1:50 lev (decreased lev by brokers) $1000 capital x50 lev= 50k = .5 lot

.5 lot x 1400 pips = 7 grand

200 pip cushion till dead acc.






if they vote stay, estimated move is 700 pips .

.5 lot x 700 pips= 3.5 grand

200 pip cushion till dead acc.



so either way you're either up 7k -(1k dead acc) or up 3.5k (-1k dead acc.    


so 6k or 2.5k profit off of every 1k invested.

I've got about $10k liquid assets, and am willing to use about half of that to start my investment journey. Last week, T-Mobile announced that they would give away one share of their stock per customer. This sort of forced me to begin my life in investments. They had me create an account with LOYAL3, which I had never heard of, and claim that they will cover all fees should I want to sell or transfer my stock away from LOYAL3 by the end of the year.

This brings me to my dillema: Since I'm a Mint user, I have the ability to have Wealthfront manage my money up to the first $15k. I definitely want to eventually switch over to Vanguard and ""do it myself,"" but feel like this would be a good learning opportunity so see how Wealthfront diversifies my funds and what the market really ""looks like"" for a couple years (or a couple grand.) Also, I am aware that Wealthfront's tax loss harvesting will have no bearing on my Roth IRA.

My question to you is: Should I take advantage of the fee free investment from Wealthfront while I learn the ropes, or transfer the T-Mobile stock and my initial investment to Vanguard and play this on Hard Mode?

I could really use some good advice. I'm totally new to this ""finally having enough money to save money"" thing, and don't want to screw it up.

16-06-17,4ojl7v,Recent purchase: Hormel Foods.,"After a recent failure to buy a house, I'm slowly returning to the stock market. I had sold all my stocks for a possible down payment, but I'm easing myself back in.

I bought some HRL this morning. 

I bought this for a couple of reasons:

1. The balance sheet is healthy. Quick ratio is 0.99, and the company does not employ much long term debt.
2. The company is a consistent performer, at least over the past five years. Sure, not huge amounts of earnings growth, but it's at least growing with the rate of inflation. 
3. The nature of the meat industry is defensive. People will always enjoy their bacon. Furthermore, given that bacon has become vogue again, that does bode well for the company's fortunes in the near future. 
4. The company has been trying to diversify away a bit from the meat business - as recent purchases of brands like Skippy peanut butter do indicate.
5. There was a recent selloff because people feel that food stocks were getting overvalued, which may be true, but there is a price to pay for earnings consistency. There is a small opportunity here to buy a great company.

One major risk I do forsee (and this is something associated with food production) is that a bad bout of bird flu or swine flu could hit revenue, but that's about it. 

Granted, I didn't do a whole lot of research, but the company's business is pretty easy to understand and their balance sheet is relatively clean. At this moment in time, I think it's a good buy. ",7

Intro:

So, you’re ready to play an oil rebound, and don’t want to stick your dick into the crazy that is UWTI/DWTI. Actually, the rebound seems to have already happened. So who stands to profit? That’s right, oil companies. Valero Energy Corporation ($VLO) closed at $51.79 as of today. I’m betting $1,700 that it’ll be at least up to $60 by September, and I’m targeting $65. I stand to make about a 400% profit over the next 2.5% months if we get to the middle of that range. How will I be doing that? OTM options. Completely naked. Just like the faggot I am.  


What’s the story?

Right now, we’re at our 52 week low. Last July/August, we got beat down from over 70 to a low of 51.68, about a 25% drop. Oil started heading down mid July, and Valero started tanking (lock in step with major indices) pretty exactly a month later, in mid August. S&amp;P fell 15%. Then, VLO climbed back to over 70 within 2 and a half months, helped by oil rebounding and an EPS beat. Immediately afterward, oil went on continual decline from mid November thru February this year. Perhaps due to the previous two 10% dips and immediate recoveries of the price of oil in the prior 2 months (September/October 2015), the subsequent market recession was a bit delayed this time. S&amp;P started dropping for good in late December, another 15% drop. During this same time period, Valero fell from low 70’s to low-mid 60’s, mirroring the 15% drop. As the price of oil failed to rally after stalling just above early January lows, and took another nose dive, so too did Valero plummet, dropping about another 20% as the S&amp;P tumbled a bit as well. With rising oil through late February and March, Valero got the last 20% it lost right back in a month and a half, but stopped about $5 short of it’s 70+ highs.

So what’s happened since then?

The price of oil has continued to go up, with across-the-board sentiment that it will at least hold around 45-50 through the end of the year, if not rally further. But Valero stock has been falling since it’s March highs, while most other oil/gas stocks I’ve compared it to have stayed flat or risen. Marathon and Phillips looked like they on track to do the same until they both had earnings misses in late April. Anyway, we’re right back at $51.79, exactly where we were last August. Perhaps this is due to fears of Brexit and instability in the Chinese economy. I think it’s the stock being undervalued. With Brexit looking less likely from its apparent probability spike a week or two ago, I believe Valero will start to rebound, making its way back to it’s level in late March of around 65 in the next 2-3 months. I wouldn’t be surprised by an earnings beat in July, but even a result at or slightly below estimates won’t stop this guy (see last 3 misses before the most recent, which coincided with oil bottoming oil).  

Statistics:  

I could go on and on about how much better Valero’s stats are than its competitors. However, Yahoo did it for me. Take a look:

http://i.imgur.com/Lg3vA2i.png  

The only reason that our PEG ratio is relatively high is that our growth rate of earnings is pretty low. There’s a shitload of barriers to entry for new refineries in the US, so there aren’t many (or any) new ones and the ones that are operating are almost always chugging along at 100% capacity. Direct result - low growth rate of earnings. As you can see, everything else pretty much CRUSHES competitor’s numbers.     

I’d like to mention a few things not listed on this chart. First, our 35% LT debt-to-equity and 2.2 current ratio. We’re very comfortable with the amount of leverage we’ve got, and are very liquid. In fact, we could pay off ALL long-term debt with current assets and still maintain a current ratio over 1. Helps to have almost $4B in cash, more CA$H per share than all our competitors. Sidetone on this, Valero is the only big oil or gas company of the 6 I’ve researched that has positive levered cash flow. We’re sittin pretty. Second, our returns on assets and equity, which sit at 7.9% and 17%, respectively. Again, blowing our competition out of the water entirely minus Phillips 66, which sits only slightly below us on both counts. Management knows what’s up. Next is EV/EBITDA, which sits at a cool 3.68. For the uninitiated, potential buyers look for a low EV/EBITDA as a potential sign of an undervalued company for them to acquire. 3.68 is well below the competition, which are at between 10 and 30. Lastly, I’d like to point our how tight our operating margin is to our gross margin, especially when compared to our competition. We may not get a ton of margin on our product, but we know exactly how to squeeze the most out of it. Oh and our short ratio is 2.1. Not many people are thinking this is heading down further.

How to play it?   

You could buy stock, but that’s some pussy shit. Let’s find some juicy calls. Here’s the Option Chain for September 16:

http://imgur.com/wsdVsVC  

As you can see, the open interest on the put side is centered right around where we are now. In comparison, the open interest on the call side is noticeably higher, centered (who coulda guessed) right around 65. I’m going to hazard a guess that most of the puts are being used as hedges or safety nets in case of the market/oil tanking. If we are to try to balance risk and reward, without needing to pay too much per contract, we might find something in the 55-62.5 range attractive. I’m expecting VLO to hit AT LEAST 60 during these next 3 months, barring a major market correction. I’m also looking to get out before we get too close to November and the volatility that will bring, which is why I like September. Coincidentally, September 16 is also my real life cake day. You can buy me some dildos with your gainz. Anyway, I like the 57.5 strikes. They’re less than $1 (per share) more than the 65 strikes, with $7.5 more breathing room, and cost me $115 per contract, letting me get a decent volume (15 contracts). IV is about 30% for this option, the low end of where it usually sits for this stock. If I expect at least $60 per share, they’ll be worth at least $2.50 at expiration. With a price of $1.15, that’s over 2:1 reward:risk, which moves to almost 7:1 if we reach my price target of 65. If it means anything, analyst opinion listed by Yahoo Finance has a mean price target of 72, a low of 57, and a high of 100, across 15 brokers.   

I don’t know shit about technicals so hopefully those support this too. Fuck if I know. YOLO.

16-06-17,4ojs1v,Investing Discussion: Aging Baby Boomers and US Residential Real Estate,"  So we're at an interesting time. The [costs of borrowing](http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/pmms30.htm) for residential real estate are currently near historic lows. 

  Simultaneously, I believe the demand for traditional, single-family residential real estate is going to drop precipitously over the next 20 years. A few factors I think will influence both **RRE demand** and the **type of RRE demanded**:
  
  - [Baby boomers reach retirement age](http://www.agingstats.gov/main_site/data/2012_documents/images/Popl_indicator1.GIF) and forgo their single family residences to move into retirement communities and warmer climates. 
  
  - Changing patterns of employment impact geographical demand for housing: rise of the digital economy enables people to live in communities based on lifestyle considerations and CoL, rather than proximity to employment, delaying the demand for home ownership and permanent single-family residences. 
  
  - Increasing disparity in concentrated markets: highest-paying jobs increasingly concentrated in urban markets (SF, DC, NY); among millennials, less desire to live in ""suburbia"", drawn to urban centers or micro-urban markets in T2 MSA's with similar perks as T1 MSA's (e.g. Charlotte, Minneapolis).
  
  - Higher education and delayed families: employees are now entering the workforce later and after more years of schooling, following a secular trend observed in many Western countries. On average, new employees are saddled with increased debt-to-income ratios and starting families later, leading to delayed childbearing and delayed demand for the traditional home. 
  
  - Secular trend (anecdotal): Less appetite for leverage among millennials. I believe this stems from experiencing the mortgage banking crisis at a young age. Unsure if this a short-term effect or a lasting, generational secular change.  
  
  - Secular trend (anecdotal): Millennials have less demand for property ownership (sharing economy) than boomers, more emphasis on ""experiences"", less on physical ownership and displays of wealth (McMansions) that have driven RRE trends since the 60's. This stems from changes in the cultural zeitgeist in the past 20 or so years that have affected the way young adults accumulate social capital: a de-emphasis on materialism and wealth accumulation, and increased priority on sustainability, lifestyle authenticity, and cultural fluidity.   

Thoughts? Feel free to discuss, comment, or disagree. I'd like to start a healthy discussion on how one would be able to invest in these trends. Residential real estate is a starting point, but all ideas are welcome (e.g. investing in retirement home or assisted healthcare services).  ",24

Is it better to sell off shares if you assume there will be a temporary downturn and buy back in @ $0.50(with the assumption it will rise again) and then ride that up to $0.60 and sell again. Or would you just be better off holding your original purchase through the downturn.

16-06-16,4oe8th,"Hey fucktards, want to the know the likelihood of a drug passing a certain phase?","&gt;**The Phase I transition success rate was 63.2% (n=3,582).** As this Phase is typically conducted for safety testing and is not
dependent on efficacy results for candidates to advance, it is common for this phase to have the highest success rate among the
clinical phases across most categories analyzed in this report. Phase I success rates may also benefit from delayed reporting bias,
as some larger companies may not deem failed Phase I programs as material and thereby not report them in the public domain.
**The Phase II transition success rate (30.7%, n=3,862)** was substantially lower than Phase I, and the lowest of the four phases
studied. As this is generally the first stage where proof-of-concept is deliberately tested in human subjects, Phase II consistently
had the lowest success rate of all phases. This is also the point in development where industry must decide whether to pursue
the large, expensive Phase III studies and may decide to terminate development for multiple reasons including commercial
viability. **The second-lowest phase transition success rate was found in Phase III (58.1%, n=1,491).** This is significant as most
company-sponsored Phase III trials are the longest and most expensive trials to conduct.

16-06-16,4oebmx,"Why MFRM (Mattress Firm) is good buy &lt;- convince me otherwise","Mattress Firm is a mattress retailer that has been on an acquisition spree. You have probably seen their stores in your town: Sleepys, Sleep Train, Sleep America, Mattress World -- all acquired by Mattress Firm. They now have over 3500 stores and 31% market share, making them the dominant mattress retail player. $MFRM will rebrand all of the stores to ""Mattress Firm"" over the next few Q's.

But all of those acquisitions led to a lot of debt, which has weighed down their EPS and drained their cash. They just brought on a new CEO. And last week they wrote down the cost of rebranding, causing a surprise loss for the Q.  All of these factors have been hammering the stock price.

But I really like their strategy, which is why I am long MFRM (disclosure!): They are trying to monopolize the mattress retailer market, and I think they can do it.

* There is a glut of mattress retailers, and Mattress Firm owns so many that it can shut down the less-profitable ones and drive prices/margins higher in a lot of markets.

* Increasing scale means lower costs for MFRM. Warehousing and inventory costs per store can be reduced.

* Increasing scale means more effective marketing. They are creating a national brand that will be ubiquitous. When you think mattresses, you will think ""Mattress Firm"" because you will see them everywhere and you will see their ads everywhere.

The biggest threat is direct-to-consumer online mattress sales, debt, and recession.

Currently 5% of mattress sales come from direct-to-consumer online sales, whereas general furniture sales is currently 10-15% online, so mattresses are lagging. I think direct-to-consumer sales will take some share of the market, but a lot of people will still try the mattress in a store before laying down money on a purchase. And I think they will go to Mattress Firm. I don't think showrooming will be an issue with direct-to-consumer sales because they don't offer the same products.

Servicing the debt could be an issue. I think the mattress business gives predictable revenue and the financial challenge of low cash and lots of debt is manageable.

MFRM has relatively low institutional ownership, and not a ton of analyst coverage. I think it has slipped under the radar, got recently hammered, and is well positioned to move up in the next few years.",15

Author also gives an example for a preferred stock.

Here is the relevant bit:

Investors have been starving for yield over the past couple of years. In a low interest rate environment, nothing looks attractive. Even if a dividend focused company could afford to hike dividends, they often chose to take advantage of the low cost of debt and expanded instead, sometimes leading to disastrous results (see Linn Energy (NASDAQ:LINEQ)). What's worse is that even when the management seems to be committed to dividend investors (e.g. I've warned investors many times about ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)), they can go back on their words in an instant, leaving investors to deal with the consequences themselves.

It is a treacherous market indeed.

Can one safely invest in high yield securities? To answer that question, we first have to define what is ""safe."" If you subscribe to the idea that safety is the lack volatility (which is completely fine), then I say you should not be looking for high yield investments in the first place. Securities that offer high yields are often cast aside by the market, people can't wait to get rid of them. When you are going against the crowd, there is no practical way to guard against volatility (unless derivatives are used, but that's a whole another topic). However, if you are willing to accept that the market is sometimes wrong and high volatility does not entail risk, then we are talking.

The second question we have to answer is whether the dividend is a return of capital or a return on capital. If a dividend is merely a return of capital, then a decline in the security is completely justified. If you had $100 in your bank account (the stock) and you withdrew $10 (the dividend), then only $90 would be left in the bank. However, if we determine that a dividend is a return on capital, then the security is worthy of further analysis.

However, things are rarely this clear in reality. For example, if a cyclical company posts a money losing quarter, yet still chooses to pay a dividend, is this a return of capital or a return on capital? To answer this question we must recognize that capital and earnings are intertwined. For example, the dividend can be treated as a return of capital as the company did not generate earnings in the most recent reporting period. However, it could also be viewed as a return on capital as the company has generated profits in previous years. How do we deal with this situation?

Rarely is a company immune from cyclicality (if you do find one please let me know), especially if they are high yielders. In this situation, we would need to make a decision whether a loss was the result of secular change or a temporary hiccup that it can recover from. If the loss is the result of secular change, then we have to determine if the current yield provides a satisfactory margin of safety (e.g. you would still be willing to invest even if the yield is cut in half). My belief is that dividend investors would do well to stay away from companies with deteriorating prospects (i.e. secular change), especially when dealing with the common stock, as subsequent declines in profit often accelerate much faster than anticipated.

When we deem a loss to be transitory in nature, then we must analyze the company's near term financial obligations. ""But wait, I thought investing is about focusing on the long-term?"" That is true, but only if you are investing for growth or total return. For a dividend/income investor however, a company's ability to honor its payments is of utmost importance. Furthermore, high yielders often plunge after a payment is skipped, hurting investors twice in the process.

So with other brokerage when I read through the fees for margin account , they have a % and a ratio built to a margin account.

With a typical margin account can I still do unlimited day trades with cash coming back for instant trade, or is there any limitation how many day trades can I do (excluding penny stock/ high volatile trades) ?

A lot of people are talking about sympathy votes for Bremain (a sad tragedy, the killing of the MP for sure) but the uncertainty is huge simply because both sides are neck and neck right now. The moment the campaigns were suspended, FTSE came up from 4 month lows as if the suspension changed anything. The DAX hit about 9480 and is back at 9600+. This will not hold in my opinion as the week starts off. If the fear and uncertainty sent the DAX from about 10,100 to 9,480, I expect this week that the DAX will hit at least 9300 as the date nears.

My strategy (yes numbnuts, I have a strategy) is buying puts on both indexes come Monday. Forex is too hot for me to handle, though I do believe the Euro and the Pound will fall in the coming days up to the referendum.

16-06-17,4olt5s,"Why can't I buy these stocks?","Hey.

There are some stocks I've been chasing for days, but I can't seem to buy any of them for a price that I'm willing to pay.

Here's an example. The stock ripples between 0.25 &amp; 0.26 only. (0.25 = sell, 0.26 = buy price,so you can immediately buy @0.26 or sell @0.25, I understand the concept.)

I see that transactions go through @0.25 &amp; @0.26 (so some people are selling @0.25 and some others buy at that price), but my buy order @0.25 doesn't get filled even though I place my order after three to five seconds after the market is closed, like 17:50:03 or something. I tried to buy various stocks that are cheaper than 1, but no luck. And yes, I've waited till the day is over.

Volume isn't the issue, they have ""enough"" volume (a few million shares per day, so that makes at least $250K) even though they're cheap.

GTC (good till cancelled) orders aren't available for our stock market (Turkey), so everybody has to place their orders after 17:50:00 in order to get in the line for tomorrow.

I know HFT guys have their own servers in the stock market's datacenter, so I can't beat them easily, but I think the stocks I choose are too small for them to trade, I've heard that they mainly buy-sell banks' and other big companies's stocks since they're highly volatile and high volume (&gt;100 M) stocks.

---

I'm planning to use an automated system, so robot module will place multiple orders in the right time (&lt; 1second), like 17:50:00.50.


Do you think it'd make a difference in my case? If not, how the hell these guys -whoever they are- manage to buy @0.25 and sell @0.26?",1

Initially I was under the impression that with some good thinking and luck I could make a weekly profit but after learning about stockbrokers and other intricacies it's clearly not that simple.

What I've learned so far: What a portfolio is, dont touch penny stocks, mutual funds are safe, invest in something you are interested in an/or could actually see yourself owning, invest in several stocks at a time.

 For the record, I just turned 21 and my original intention was to use the stock market as a side income type of deal. I'm a tutor in college. If I was to invest, I would likely begin with $500-1000.

Looking for schadenfreude.,"The first job I had out of school was with a privately-owned company, so its 401k match was split up in the proportion of funds I had selected.  When I took my current job I was surprised to find that the company match was in ESOP shares, and at times a bit of cash from dividends.  **I am not looking for any particular advice.**  I understand the inherent risk of holding shares in one's employer, and make an effort to ensure my 401k is diverse. I am fortunate to work for a company that makes things that will be needed for a long time, but I also know that shit happens.


That said, lunchtime discussions at work make me think this could be an interesting topic of discussion, and maybe even schadenfreude.  Every so often I hear someone at work talk about retiring in X months if the stock price keeps going up (they usually don't retire), or making their 401k 100% of the employee stock fund when the share price gets near a 52 week low (it can always go lower).  Some people made a killing after making big bets when the share price was on life support in 2008/9, others have been burned trying to time a big price swing.


I am also trying to get a sense of how common the practice is.  It seems like a really good thing for the company, but slightly annoying for the employees that would prefer to put a firewall between employment and retirement.",1

16-06-18,4omp6d,*Serious* CF Industries DD (buy as much as you can),"Over the past several days, I've been looking closely at CF Industries, a supplier of nitrogen-based fertilizer. 

The stock has taken a huge hit as of late and it's approaching what I consider ""dumpster territory"". It has lost over 30% year to date. Furthermore, the dividend yield is a juicy 4.2%, with a PE at around 13. 

The reason for this decline is that CF is facing reduced demand for fertilizer from farmers who are facing reduced commodity prices. Fertilizer prices can vary pretty widely. Despite these headwinds, the company has remained profitable. For example, it posted $1 billion of revenue and $26 million in net income on its most recent quarter. 

Some of you may ask, ""Where's the free cash flow? It's been negative the past few quarters."" Well, they are coming off of a huge capex spending spree that will hopefully lower the cost of production going forward and give the company positive free cash flow again. Furthermore, they just got $2.9 billion from the cancelled merger with OCI, which was cancelled due to political pressure (it was widely viewed as a tax inversion). 

There's a lot of uncertainty with this stock, though. The Chinese could continue to dump their coal-based fertilizers here at depressed prices. Food prices could remain depressed, discouraging farmers from buying fertilizer. The price of natural gas, which has long remained depressed, could suddenly go up and hit gross margins like a mother. 

But, this is a company that is hitting the bargain bin, a rarity in today's market, trading at a decent valuation in relation with recently depressed earnings. The volatility behind fertilizer prices also gives this company a very appealing risk/reward profile. It controls a huge chunk of domestic production for one of the most important inputs to agriculture. 

This is a buy in my book, given that the world will always need ammonium nitrate to grow food. Given enough patience, this thing could even hit $70 again. The agricultural industry is cyclical in nature, which is why it's always wise to buy at the bottom of the cycle. Plus, you get this nice yield while you wait.

16-06-18,4opl2h,Shorting (Skimming?) Eurozone Sovereign Bonds.,"So as most know, currently there is a great deal of Eurozone short term bonds [giving negative yields](http://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/quickview.do?SERIES_KEY=165.YC.B.U2.EUR.4F.G_N_A.SV_C_YM.SR_1Y).  I have no idea who the hell buys things that promise negative yields up front (even before looking at base inflation, or inflation and rate change risk.)  

While I am curious what motivates pleanty of people to buy this crap, the details and motivation are irrelivent.  What I want to know is if someone can explain to me (a slightly slow n00b) is a simple way I can do a leveraged short of these things.  Although I am not sure ""short"" is exactly the right word - hence the proposed ""skimming"" in the title - because while what I am talking about is technically a short position, shorting bonds is usually about looking for the difference in purchase price with respect to their change around interest rate changes.  Instead, what I want to do is barrow a bunch of negative yield bonds, and some-how sell them off to the aparently large market of people who mysteriously seem to like their negative coupons in a way that I can pocket the difference between the current face value of the bond, and its final value lest coupons by holding my short position until the bond matures.

16-06-18,4opmw8,Want to make money over the summer? Here are my top three picks:,"Some people asked me for ways to make money over the summer. Please note those aren't necessarily the best investments, but they offer the best possible gains over the summer for not too much work.

1) Short DWTI

This bitch is going down. Not that I'm that bullish on oil, but let's face it, oil has bottomed. It will most likely waver between $45 and $55 all summer long and DWTI will get rekt.

2) Short VXX

Brexit is not happening. Stocks are due to FINALLY break record. VXX will plummet below $10 by summer end, (almost) guaranteed.

3) Short YANG

China's stock troubles are over. Manipulators tried to fuck China, they failed miserably and now they are crying to the mommies. Shanghai should not drop below 2,680 and will most likely soar above 3,000. Shorting YANG seems like a no-brainer at this point.

16-06-18,4oq88l,$GLYC DD Small Cap BioTech,"Happy Saturday WSB. I made too much coffee this morning and wanted to try some DD again.  
  
[Last time I gave you this for $EXEL when it was at 4.30ish](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/4f303b/exel_dd/) And now the stock is trading [at 7.xx] (http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=exel) Full Disclosure: I cucked myself with a stop loss and was out near $5.00  
  
&amp;nbsp;   
  
**TL;DR**   
  

$GLYC is a thinly traded biotech company with a Phase 3 Sickle Cell and a Phase 2 Leukemia drug in their pipeline. They fuck around with blood diseases.  They just issued $19.x million in new stock and as of yesterday their stock took a 15% haircut. before that they had 38.x million in the bank (which will keep them from worrying about funding or pfizer for a year or so). They will burn about 7-12 mill a quarter. They got enough cash to live for awhile.
  
They partnered with Pfizer to develop and market their sickle cell drug and if all goes well in phase 3, they have 70 more million in regulatory and 100 + million in commercial bonuses from that.   
  
**Portfolio:** Nothing (Pre-Commercial)  
**Patents:**  They don't make anything yet, but they still have the patents for their sickle cell (exp 2023-2030) and their cancer drug (exp 2032)  
  

**Pipeline:** 1.)[GMI-1070 Sickle Phase 3](http://www.glycomimetics.com/for-clinicians/gmi-1070/)  
  
2.) [GMI-1271 Leukemia Phase 1/2](http://www.glycomimetics.com/for-clinicians/gmi-1271/)   
  
3.) 3 other preclinical drugs. Mostly just fucking around with AML and blood disorders.
    
&amp;nbsp;  

**Simple Reasons I'm Long:**

1.) They compete with $MSTX, but they aren't MSTX (big positive) all they really have to do to win this fight is not be $MSTX (GLYC is 73% institution owned MSTX is 22% look where the smart money hangs out)    
  
2.) [100,000 people get sickle cell. and a bunch go to the hospital because it gives them ow-ies. their pfizer-partnered drug gets them out of the hospital faster and reduces their dependence on opioids to mitigate pain. ](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3870916-glycomimetics-novel-therapeutic-approach-possible-high-returns) 
  
3.) [Their Phase 2 drug has big benefits when coupled with chemo in dealing with leukemia. everyone hates cancer and wants it to go away. plus the drug is targets for old people and the USA is basically nothing but old, soon to be cancer sufferers. ](http://ir.glycomimetics.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=975221) 
  
 
4.) Glycans drugs are pretty cool. They slow the growth of tumors and act as a great 1-2 punch with chemo. In addition there are other potential blood diseases that are affected by these carbohydrates. Universities, and doctors are into them.    
   

5.) [A decent Pipeline with Phase 2 and phase 3 results coming for different drugs. and R&amp;D expenditures indicate that one of their preclinical drugs will soon enter phase 1](http://www.glycomimetics.com/pipeline-technology/product-portfolio/gmi-1359/)
  

6.) $12 dollar target in 1 year    
  

7.) Enough Cash on Hand to operate through 2017

*History*  

  

**2014 Shit**  
  
Company IPO's. They were founded in 2003 and with the IPO came an announcement of a drug development deal with Pfizer. These deals and royalty payments are one revenue stream that will let the company build it's own drug distribution sales and marketing force. 
  
~[GLYC got 20 mil from pfizer last year for their sickle cell drug. they can pick up about 70 million more Under the Pfizer agreement, before the drug goes to market.](https://ipocandy.com/2014/01/glycomimetics-tries-again-with-lower-price-and-more-shares/)  
  
~&gt;[we received an upfront payment of $22.5 million from Pfizer. We are also eligible to receive payments of up to $115.0 million upon the achievement of specified development milestones, including the dosing of the first patients in Phase 3 clinical trials for up to two indications and the first commercial sale of a licensed product in the United States and selected European countries for up to two indications, up to $70.0 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory milestones, including the acceptance of our filings for regulatory approval by regulatory authorities in the United States and Europe for up to two indications, and up to $135.0 million upon the achievement of specified levels of annual net sales of licensed products p.2](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1253689/000119312514124006/d699733d10k.htm)  If the phase three trials work out, there's 135 more million for GLYC to get for doing not much of anything anymore
  
~Phase 3 trials have been going on for about 1 year now. [They are fast tracked but we still got some time](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02187003?term=rivipansel&amp;rank=1)

&amp;nbsp;
  
**2015 Shit**  
  
~[manufacturing delays the drug production of their sickle cell drug, pfizer figures it out and starts phase 3 and hooks up another 20 mil.](http://ir.glycomimetics.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=919141) 
  

~GLYC wants to sell their own drugs.
&gt;[We have not yet established a sales, marketing or drug distribution infrastructure. With the exception of rivipansel, to which we have granted Pfizer exclusive commercialization rights, we generally expect to retain commercial rights in the United States for our current drug candidates ... We also plan to build a marketing and sales management organization to create and implement marketing strategies for any drugs that we market through our own sales organization and to oversee and support our sales force. The responsibilities of the marketing organization would include developing educational initiatives with respect to approved drugs and establishing relationships with thought leaders in relevant fields of medicine. p16](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1253689/000119312515093802/d838695d10k.htm)   
     
&amp;nbsp;  
  
**2016 Shit**  
  
~[&gt;We believe we have enough money to get us through Q1 2017 without anymore milestone payments from pfizer. p30](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1253689/000155837016003688/glyc-20151231x10k.htm#ITEM1ARISKFACTORS_845333)   
  
~[But 2017 isn't far enough in the future for those sweet pfizer deals. so they issued some stock last week, and pulled 19 million from that.](http://ir.glycomimetics.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=976157)  
  
~[Their phase 2 drug is being tested by (probably) grad students at the university of michigan for non cancer related reasons. the american heart association gave UMI 1.5 million dollars to check out the drug](http://ir.glycomimetics.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=886162)   
  
~[they received fast track FDA status on their leukemia drug](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/glycomimetics-gmi-1271-receives-fda-130000848.html) 
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
**Future Potential/Events:**  
  
1.) Phase 3 trials go well, maybe pfizer wants to just buy the company.  
2.) GLYC develops its own sales force and starts selling cancer drugs  
3.) They shit the bed and it goes bankrupt.    
4.) [Phase 3 Results in 2018 on their sickle cell drug could lead to more checks from Pfizer](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02187003)  
5.) Phase 2 results will come out for GMI 1271, their cancer drug. Potentially they could sell this drug after Phase 2, like their deal with pfizer on their sickle cell drug. 


&amp;nbsp;   
  
**Challenges**  (IN WSB terms)
  
1. [That penny stock garbage $MSTX wants to fight sickle cell. There are 7 other companies with compounds to combat sickle cell as well p.17](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1253689/000155837016003688/glyc-20151231x10k.htm)  
  
2. Pfizer controls the progression of GMI-1070. Pfizer could pull a dick move like Sanofil did to MNKD  
  
3. [clinical trials don't usually go so well. it's not quite a coin flip](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/4oe8th/hey_fucktards_want_to_the_know_the_likelihood_of/)

If the strikers get better pay then they increase their income which makes them more likely to borrow money. and they also spend the money so it increases the income of businesses so the business hire more workers to meet the new demand.

Stay out of it.","I look forward to the witty bantz this will receive but if this saves even one of you from getting fucked it will be worth it.  I need people around here to hate on for years to come. If you lose all your money this week and have to live in your parent's house that still has dial-up it's a negative to me so that's why I'm telling you.

There is no reason for you to be trading anything this week.  We just went through a week of constantly down pressure after hitting new all-time highs. Now futures are flashing extremely green.  

The market is trading primarily on Brexit which means it's trading on random polls of random selections of UK citizens that (literally) have no idea what they're doing until they do it.  You could be up in your positions and then some UK news outlet at any time could announce it just did a poll showing _____ and the market could massively reverse.

There's no significant earnings, there's nothing going on you need to be trading this week.  You're not missing out on any gains - there's always more to be found next week.  

The up signal for tomorrow is because of relieving pressure that Brexit will happen but truly no one knows.  If it suddenly does happen no one knows what the short term impact will be.  It's happening on the same day as jobs report which is the thing most affecting the Fed right now. Given how much trading is down by algos a combination of factors could make Friday an absolute crash.

Just be chill.  Go jerk off to totally nude singles in your area and come back next week",57

16-06-20,4ox508,YOLO ban,"I propose a general stop to using the phrase ""yolo"". 

Investing is an art, sometimes a science, which is focused on the careful allocation of risk units in exchange for reward units. The smart investor understands that he is always taking some sort of risk, even in Treasury bonds. That intelligent investor has made a careful assessment of the expected return and has thought through the risk being ""worth it"".

The ""YOLO"" term undermines the central point of investing. While it is tautological that one only lives once, your capital may die a premature and permanent death. This ""roll the dice"" mentality is amateurish: I have never heard it in 15 years on Wall Street.

Investing can be exciting, and that can be a good thing. But simply searching for thrills is unwise. You can Bloomberg search for stocks with the highest implied volatility and flip coins on binary events and earnings announcements for a living, if you'd like. It doesn't lead to outsized returns.

Last year I made a very big bet on a biotech company called Celladon, earning over $20,0000,000 in my personal account. I was pleased but this was not a ""YOLO"" moment. I thought carefully about the embarrassment and ramifications of LOSING $20,000,000. I researched the situation for months until I felt comfortable I knew more about this company's drug than the company did. I was right and slept sound. No YOLO.

Becoming wealthy is difficult and requires immense patience. This ""yolo"" attitude discourages this perspective. Remember that the world's best fundamental (non-quantitative, non-insider trading) investors are making 15% returns (at best) in the current era. You will need a large starting capital base to become wealthy. Those investors are not simply in stodgy old-line stocks that prevent their returns from being large. They are appropriately (usually inappropriately, actually) measuring the tradeoff of risk units for return units and trying to make as much money as possible. No hedge fund manager would deny themselves a 100% year, but most do as the necessary risk to achieve that kind of return will subject a portfolio to disappearing. 

I hope these thoughts are helpful as you pursue your investment careers.

I plan to cover such topics as:
*How to understand if penny stocks have main characteristics to consider it is as penny stock so-called micro-cap stock or nano-cap stock. 
*Conditions under which it is possible to trade penny stocks (can call it ""finding an edge"").  
*What do all best traders, speculators, and investors agree on when it comes to succeeding in markets. 
*Free online tools which to use to start screening and finding penny stocks (tools are applicable for other bigger stocks). 
*How to find a great broker to trade trough and MORE TOPICS.

Since they don't have large amounts of money, there is a bit of a barrier to purchasing anything with values over the $100 mark.   ( at one given time )

They are kind of eyeing some higher dividend ETF with low price, such as PGX, MLPJ and MORL.

And then another commission based only account with Well's Fargo that I have $50,000 in (mainly with ETF's and BAC and XOM).

But for an investor who plans to Dollar-Cost-Average (DCA) her investment, e.g. buying the index for a fixed amount of cash each month/quarter, we also expect that her actual IRR will be lower, since DCA provides lower returns than investing lump sums, based on historical performance.

My question is - has anybody ever calculated the rolling absolute return of a 15-20 years investment in the S&amp;P 500 with DCAing on a monthly/quarterly basis? It would be useful to know the median returns a ""normal"" investor starting out should really be expecting from her stocks portfolio, given she doesn't have a lump sum to invest but rather intends on purchasing a little every month.

&gt; However, some ask whether Square is making it too easy. For instance, Square acts as the retailers’ agent and pays the 20-cent fee per transaction that businesses would normally forward to payment systems managers such as  Visa  (V). Square’s 2.75% fee is higher than that of rivals like Heartland Payment Systems,  Global Payments  (GPN),  Vantiv  (VNTV), and  First Data  (FDC). They tend to charge about 1.75%, but don’t absorb the 20-cent fee. 

&gt; That doesn’t sound like much, **but it can be the margin between making or losing money on small transactions.** A $5 purchase at a retailer would net Square 14 cents. But once it handed over the 20-cent fee, **Square would register a six-cent loss.**

&gt; “You simply can’t serve this segment of the market at the price points that Square uses,” says Wedbush’s Luria. Square CFO Friar argues that at its **roughly $53 average transaction** value the 20-cent fee doesn’t make a big difference, noting that the company focuses on aggregate values. **She declined to say how big a portion of transactions fall below $10.**

I got in on this early, around $14, but now it seems that they can't compete on low end transactions ($10-ish), but focusing on ""average"" transactions of $53. Yet they continue to bleed cash. I think the difference between the avg and the low end (possibly the ""mean"" [?]), is due to, what I believe the numeratii identify as ""skew.""

I have been doing options with calls only... with mild success. Ups and downs (as expected) but general concepts are there.

I want to develop a similar approach for buying puts. However, I believe that I need help understanding my strategy. For example, my gut wants me to purchase the most expensive OTM put contract knowing that there is no way (even on good news) the stock can reach that price. That being said, from what I understand as the put contracts get closer to expiration, they get cheaper and cheaper. At that point you sell at a low price and take profit.

I assume there is a major piece I am missing out of the above equation. Do put contracts expire with value? Is that the catch?

I think car manufacturers would likely buy electric motors rather than make them themselves, although I'm open to thoughts on that.

The obvious choice is Siemens, especially with Germany, Norway, and Netherlands passing bills banning gas vehicles sales by a certain year and their recent joint venture with Valeo. Not to mention that high gasoline prices shifts the economics towards EVs. GE is another choice, although I think EV adoption in the US will be slower than Europe and Asia. A good market is Japan, China, and India given the pollution levels, India's initiatives for EVs, and Japan's already strict emissions requirements. I'm not aware of a good choice of electric motor companies in Asia, is anyone aware of a Siemens or GE equivalent there? As far as I know electric motor design and production isn't rocket science (not that it's the simplest thing either) so does anyone know if any company has an edge over the competition?

&gt;Critics point out that bank preferred stocks fell sharply during the 2007-08 financial crisis. 


Welp, this is true.  So what do we conclude? 


&gt;Preferred stocks are riskier than bonds. **But high-quality preferred stocks with attractive dividend streams are relatively stable** and are only moderately more volatile than bonds. 

Yah, until they drop 40%+ with equities during a crash.  Everything is stable until it's not. 


Which is it burt? Are we to just ignore the flight to quality aspects of sovereign debt in favor of yield? Is this not a common folly of the retail investor?  Did you not write a whole book about the market being good at pricing the risks associated with such securities?  Come on Burt, we need to know.

16-06-21,4p1unu,YOLO Support,"I propose an increase in use of the phrase ""yolo"".

Investing is an art, sometimes a science, which is focused on the careless allocation of risk units in exchange for reward units. The smart investor cannot understand that he is taking some sort of risk, especially in options. That intelligent investor has made a careless assessment of the expected return and has never thought through the risk before YOLOing.

The ""YOLO"" term epitomizes the central point of investing. While it is tautological that one only lives once, your capital will always increase no matter where you invest. This ""roll the dice"" mentality is guaranteed to result in more yachts: I have always heard it in 15 years on Wall Street.

Investing can be exciting, and that is always a good thing. And searching for thrills is even better. You can use Robinhood for stocks with the highest implied volatility and flip coins on binary events and earnings announcements for a living, if you'd like. It will lead to outsized returns.

Last year I made a very big bet on a biotech company called Celladon, losing over $20,0000,000 in my personal account. I was devastated and this was definitely a ""YOLO"" moment. I never thought about the embarrassment and ramifications of LOSING $20,000,000. I never researched the situation, and I knew much less about this company's drug than the company did. I was wrong and didn't sleep. YOLO.

Becoming wealthy is easy and requires immense impulsiveness. This ""YOLO"" attitude encourages this perspective. Remember that the world's best fundamental (non-quantitative, non-insider trading) investors are making 200% returns (at worst) in the current era. You will need no money to become wealthy. Those investors are carelessly shorting stocks and investing in options. They are never measuring the tradeoff of risk units for return units and are always investing every last penny in options. No hedge fund manager would deny themselves a 100% year, but most do as the necessary risk to achieve that kind of return will always get 200% returns.

I hope these thoughts are helpful as you pursue your investment careers.

YOLO.

16-06-21,4p52ye,A thank you and some suggested changes coming to r/investing,"Hello investors!

It has been a while since I addressed this community, so let me start by introducing myself to the 160,000 subscribers that have joined since I first got here.

I got my start in the markets in the mid 90's, not in the traditional way, I was a small cap promoter. The story of my experience is in the wiki if you want to [read about that](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/158vi7/i_used_to_be_a_penny_stock_promoter_in_the_late/).

Around 2000 during the tech bubble I became a very active scalper/daytrader, those were amazing days where you could buy any tech stock at 9:30am, sell it at 9:35 and make your $500 before breakfast. 

I grew more conservative and slowed down a lot with the trading in the following years.

I went on to become a broker for RBC where most of my time was spent helping my clients plan for retirement.

Turns out being a broker was NOTHING like the movie Wall Street (the original one!). It was just a shit ton of cold calling and hand holding for clients that were panicking that the market was down today.

Around the same time an old (now gone) stock market forum I ran started getting a lot of traffic and I left the job as a broker to run the community and continued trading for myself.

I currently mod r/investing and r/stockmarket and for transparency sake, I do run the stock market forums at [stockaholics.net](http://stockaholics.net) which is linked in the sidebar of rstockmarket. You can see my ugly mug in a video that is in there.

The reason I bring you this boring story is that you often do not know who is on the other side of the screen when you talk to people online. They could be some 13yr old COD player who is on summer vacation, or it could be Jack Bogle telling you to buy Vanguard funds! (We suspect Jack Bogle has many alts here!)

This ties into another topic, that of issuing identifying flair which I will discuss further down.

I would like to address a few important issues starting with the most urgent.

A former mod (yes, we have removed him) during a heated debate implied a subscriber here should get some rope and find a balcony.

TheRealAnacular has been an excellent mod as far as dealing with spam, regulating topics and keeping the subreddit clean. The mod logs here show him doing more than any other mod!

Unfortunately when it comes to conflict resolution, some people handle it differently and things were said in the heat of argument that should not have been said.

Threatening violence against others is not how we operate here, so we are in complete agreement that he needed to step down.

I would like to let everybody know that he has done an amazing job behind the scenes and we greatly appreciate the time and effort he put into being a mod here!

Moving on!

I may not post here actively as I should, but I love this community dearly, it is the first thing I read every morning while I drink my coffee and I have it open in a tab all day, every day.

About two weeks ago u/Ozymando_ posted a critical post here telling us how everybody in r/investing is shit, the mods suck and all the topics are garbage.

I liked his spunk and blatant disregard for my feelings! So I made him a mod at r/stockmarket and we will be working together on testing out new CSS, flair and features which if successful we will then bring to r/investing!

There are several issues we need to deal with as a community, many of these listed here are reasons why the content gets stale:

1) Index/Vangaurd may be the right answer, but its also the most boring. [Arichi answered this question 2yrs ago here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1owcra/moron_monday_ask_that_question_you_always_thought/ccwd45j) and it stands true. The problem is that if the answer to every question is index funds, then we might as well just shut down this sub and forward the traffic to r/WeLoveIndexFunds

To keep topics exciting and to encourage new ideas and discussions, we need to, as a community, open this up further than short circuiting every single question about where to invest!

I know better than most that 95% of individuals coming here are probably better off just being in an index, but we need to decide how we want to do this going forward. Keep on shutting down all ideas and telling them to go to bogleheads, or open up to some additional risk* and make this place a little more fun! 

2) Flair - The topic of flair has come up many times and the biggest problem is (as any industry professional will tell you) that compliance departments will have your head for posting anything that resembles an idea or advice online. 

Due to the binary nature of the markets, even somebody tagged as ""Super Duper Amazing Analyst That Knows His Shit!!11!"" could be very wrong. I would hate to see somebody go long GE based on ""professional"" advice, only to see GE drop 5% next week because CEO Jeff Immelt had an affair with his 19yr personal assistant and is being kicked off the board.

I feel that we can find some middle ground with flair as long as everybody is aware that advice could be bad and you are ok with that.

3) The mentality ""you can't beat the market"" needs to go! 

We all know about index funds! But like I said in point #1, this place gets very stale very fast if we keep pushing that! I want to hear crazy ideas! More importantly, I want to see others debating and challenging these ideas rather than downvoting and telling the person that they can never beat the market!

There is a lot more I would like to address, but I really need to get my morning started!

Lets leave this here, but pick up on this discussion in the comments.

I want to hear your thoughts, suggestions and ideas to move this community in the right direction!

We have had some very helpful feedback already in a few other threads, so please keep them coming and I look forward to implementing some changes in the very near future!

Have a great day r/investing!

Regards from your mod team:

u/arichi,  u/hedgefundaspirations and u/CrasyMike,





re Risk  *  Understanding risk is a critical, if not the most critical part of investing or trading. New subscribers and lurkers of this sub need to understand that what works for Bob, who is a retired millionaire, might not be the best solution for Fred, who is an 18yr old student.

16-06-21,4p57oc,A couple questions from a complete noob.,"I just want to start by saying I have no experience with stocks of any kind outside of a trading simulator on my phone. 

I downloaded the trading simulator which uses real stocks and real numbers so that you can practice trading with fake money.

I came across a strategy that worked really well for me, and I wanted to know if it translates to real life at all.

First I would find a couple stocks that cost from $1 - $2, that had really high volume and high market cap. Also I looked to make sure my chosen stock is fluctuating rapidly, but only by 1 or two pennies at a time.

Next, I would dump all my money into 1 stock at the low point in the fluctuation, buying (for example) 10,000 sticks for $1 each. Then re selling 10,000 stocks for $1.01 each. Making $80 after trade fees. 

I would do this for hours upon hours buying greater and greater volume, completing thousands of trades in a day. Ultimately amassing millions.

Would this strategy realistically work for a regular person?",0

16-06-21,4p5imo,Tragic death of Sanjay Valvani,"It is with a very heavy heart that I read about Sanjay Valvani's death. The pressure of a federal indictment is immense (I would know). I have chosen to treat it as what I view the very definition of business: another challenge in a series of improbable successes. I couldn't be more saddened to see this process destroy someone.

I am certain Valvani felt tremendous shame for disappointing those around him, including his Visium partners, who must be feeling quite sorrowful at this moment. Valvani helped grow Visium to a $10bn company. Hedge funds are valued at roughly 10% of AUM, so this $1 billion valued business has disappeared overnight. 

Unfortunately, Visium's disappearance is not solely due to Valvani's actions, and insider trading is an occupational hazard for any high-performing fund manager. I'm sure there were countless times when Valvani was able to insider trade (this is very common in hedge funds) and did the right thing by ""restricting trading"" in those securities. I doubt he even knew what he was doing was strictly illegal. I'm not sure the SDNY knows after recent losses in these cases. Insider trading is a very unclear legal territory--the facts did not seem promising for his case, but SDNY has lost insider cases in recent history and he had a fighting chance. Based on USSG, I suspected a 7-10 year sentence for Valvani. He was 44.

I ran into Valvani occasionally and communicated with him from time to time on AOL Instant Messenger (used widely by hedge funds). I was closer with his other partners, recently even funding one of their projects. Visium was a leading light in the community I was honored to be a part of (healthcare hedge fund investing). He and Visium will be missed but not forgotten. I'm certain the Visium partners will forge ahead with a new fund and continue their very successful track record. I hope Valvani's family can find the strength to get through this terrible tragedy.

The price of Cobalt (important material in making batteries) has actually fallen from $15 to $11 per pound (http://www.infomine.com/investment/metal-prices/cobalt/10-year/). Despite this the stock is in an upward trend. The stock all time high is $2.25.  Did anyone else get in anytime within the past year?  ,3

16-06-21,4p2aha,Trade of the week: Short Vol,"When people inevitably freak out on Wednesday due to Brexit, jump in and sell vol. Chances of a brexit are looking incredibly low and the market has a tendency to get skittish about these binary events and start buying up options. If they vote to remain, vol should come in very hard (and it already has with polls today).  
Here are a few ways to play it:  
Sell options delta neutral. (Hedge the delta component of a call or put by selling or buying stock).  
Sell weekly or July puts in SPY or single stocks. Skew tends to be excessively steep in SPY and you collect a serious risk premium for selling them. With a remain vote these likely expire worthless.  
Buy inverse volatility ETFs such as XIV or SVXY. These moved up almost 10% as the brexot has become less likely. You can expect another 5-10% on a remain vote.  
Sell vol ETFs such as VXX or sell VIX futures.  
Note that these plays aren't looking excellent right now as the market rallied today and vol came in hard. Wait for the market to be in 1-2% (hopefully late Tuesday or Wednesday) and then jump in hard.  
If you disagree with betting on a remain vote you can make a pretty penny shorting SPY, buying VXX calls and buying SPY puts.",3

16-06-21,4p5naq,"Professional Petroleum Landman, Novice Investor here; My thoughts on the Oil Industry","I'm a 5 year landman based out of Midland, TX. I'm in no way a guru or pretending to know it all, nor am I in the business of predicting oil price, but I think there's a small fortune to be made from oil and gas companies right now on the market. 

As I type this, crude sits just below $50/barrel. I believe the worst of the bust is behind us and it's a slow, but steady climb back towards $100/barrel. I'm spreading out most of my portfolio between small cap and larger cap companies that have their main acreage in the Permian Basin of Texas. Here's why. It's the most consistent play in America. This is ground zero for oil and gas and will continue to be until they find a better field. America is different than most oil producing countries because our oil is not nationalized. Our private citizens still own their own mineral rights vs. other countries where the government makes all the money from oil sales.

Why is this important?
America will weather the storm of bust oil prices far better than countries that the sale of oil is a significant part of their national budget. With prices already bottoming out (fingers crossed we don't head south now), most companies have plans through hedging to make it back to where we are now plus some this time in 2017. Most companies have hedged their oil less than what the current price is and I believe the price of oil will only go up, leading to better earnings, company evaluations, and eventually stock price.

Being in Midland, I get the benefit of hearing the chatter around town. I can't name any names on stuff I hear, but sentiment in town is optimistic for the first time in a couple years. Lots of mergers and buy outs coming down the pipeline. I don't really think there's a bad play on any company that based out of the Permian at this time.

Not sure if I should plug in my plays that I'm currently in on here or not. But if anyone has any questions or criticisms, I'm all ears. 

EDIT: Taking my dog to the vet so I'm done for today. Stocks I like are $CWEI - $27.10, $PXD - $157.24, and $CXO - $125.74. Added price as of writing so I can be held accountable and mocked if they fall. Good luck, all!",38

16-06-20,4p0a4u,Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD),"In January of 1992 Gilead Sciences Inc.(NASDAQ:GILD) went public on the Nasdaq. Since its initial public offering of 5.75 million shares in which it raised $86.25 million, Gilead has grown to become a 110 billion dollar biotech powerhouse.

Investors that kept the faith from the IPO have been richly rewarded. A $10,000 investment made in 1992 would be worth more than 2.6 million dollars today, an approximately 26% compounded annual return.

Despite having the second highest net profit of any drug company in the world, the market has rewarded the company with a price-to-earnings multiple of just 7.07x earnings in a sector with an average p/e multiple of 23.87x earnings.

What message is the market sending with the current price of Gilead?

1. It values (grossly over-values) revenue growth above most factors in this sector

2. That it has little confidence in the mathematics of aggressive share buy-backs (or that it isn't paying attention)

3. That it doesn't have faith in management (it definitely should)

In the first 3 months of 2016, management purchased 8 billion dollars worth of Gilead common stock. The board of directors also authorized an additional 12 billion dollar share purchase plan for 2016. A 110 billion dollar market cap company buying back almost 8 percent of its shares in one quarter is extremely aggressive for a company of that size.

It's a testament to the tremendous cash-flow of the company. It's also a very strong indication of the confidence that management has in the future profitability of its portfolio of drugs. Investors have misinterpreted a quarter-over-quarter decrease in revenue and profit as a signal that revenue will continue to decline. Importantly, management has continued to offer guidance of 32 billion in revenue for 2016. Simple math dictates that if revenue of 7,794,000,000 were to continue (or decrease) in the next three quarters of 2016, that the total number would add up to less than the 32 billion in 2016 revenue that management has reaffirmed in its guidance.

When a company with 8,000 employees makes as much money as Johnson and Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) which employs 127,000 employees and has been in existence since 1885, it stands to reason to ask why the better capitalized company is rewarded with a higher market cap for earnings that it could and arguably should have had for itself. That isn't to say that the incremental earnings of a company like Johnson and Johnson shouldn't have the market value that they do. J and J has its purpose on the highway. It is steady,smart, and relatively conservative, like say a Toyota Camary.

The sky is the limit for Gilead if it continues to invest its earning with the same state of mind that it has in the past. For just 7.06 earnings you can buy a company that has returned 26% per year compounded for the past 24 years straight.

To the best of my knowledge, there is not a company that exists with a higher amount of revenue per employee. And I am almost certain that there is no company in the world with a higher net profit per employee. I haven't been able to find one. I challenge you to find one.

Conclusion: Gilead deserves much more respect than it is getting. A fair valuation for the company is $180 per share. I have faith in management to quiet many doubters with increases in revenue soon.

P/E: 7.35
P/B: 0.9
P/S: 1.4
EV/EBITDA: 6.7
Yield: 8.83%

The Net asset value/ shares outs. is &gt;15 CAD which means that the company's assets are selling for less than what they're worth in the stock market. Something which Graham claims doesnt happen often. The company has a bad year (2015) which is why it lost a lot of its market value, but they have recovered splendidly and look pretty strong financially.

16-06-21,4p651f,Easy Trading Strategy for Beginners,"I’ve been seeing quite a few posts from new traders looking to learn how to get started, strategies to incorporate, stocks to find, etc. Below is a trading strategy that I used when I first started out, and still do. 

**Platform used**: ToS

**Indicators used**:  Keltner Channels (0, 2 .0, 21, Close, Simple, Simple)


**The Idea:**

Let’s assume you are trading the utilities sector through XLU. 

The Keltner Channels help you identify a trading range that stocks move between, using a 21 day moving average and the 2 period Average True Range (ATR). This helps you identify reversals and channel breakouts, which is useful in trend trading (the type of play we will make here). 



**The Strategy:**

[Here’s what the chart currently looks like]( https://www.dropbox.com/s/qshn2ldlehvqnfh/Screen%20Shot%202016-06-21%20at%2011.20.20%20AM.png?dl=0)

1.	Go long (buy) XLU when the price is towards the bottom of the 2 ATR range, with a price target of the 21 day moving average (white line)
2.	Go short (sell) XLU when the price is towards the top of the 2 ATR range, with a price target of the 21 day moving average (white line) 

Once the price level hits your 21 day moving average line, you can reverse your position. Conversely, if price action is moving against your position, set a 2% stop loss and manage the loss. 

**Not every trade will be a winning one** 

**Conclusion**

By tracking the ebbs and flows of the market, you can time moves more efficiently and identify trend trades in an easier manner. This strategy is more commonly known as “reversion to the mean,” and helps you trade the markets in a predictable and structured manner. 


*Edit: What you will learn from this is the following: how to use indicators, building discipline around your entries and exits, managing your losses, getting a feel for the charts. As /u/BDempster mentioned, this should not be the only indicator you use to trade.*

For those that don't know: Sometimes a company you hold shares in becomes part of a class action lawsuit on if they potentially violated SEC regulations.

If they are found to have been in violation of SEC regulations you can gain some of the winnings from the case. I'm not sure of the amount but I believe it is quite low..

As to why I received more than one of them. I think the advisement firm that was in control of the portfolio in the past was just a horrible stock picker.

16-06-21,4p6ggj,Help! Differing advice from 2 FPs,"Thanks in advance.  Short version is I've been working with a non-fiduciary 1% fee FP for a few years and have been very happy.  Thanks to John Oliver last week, I was prompted to investigate what I'm paying in fees.  I am paying very high fees in a permanent indexed life policy (after maxing out backdoor Roth, 403b and some in mutual funds).  I make $250,000 per yr and wife makes $90000.

This led me to meet with a fiduciary FP who recommended index instead of active funds and mutual bonds instead of the permanent life policy.

Can anyone chime in about the relative pros and cons of each?

16-06-21,4p6jc9,What investments can be made in order to profit in the event of another major economic crisis?,"My dad is worried that another crisis may occur in the next 12-18 months. His reasons include global political turmoil, negative interest rates, and the $20 trillion in US debt, as well as the additional cost of unfunded liabilities.  
  
I no longer think it's crazy to spend time worrying about such concerns and am looking for investment ideas to help protect his 401k.  
  
Gold and silver are doing really well this year after a five year bear market. Their price is inversely correlated to the strength of the U.S. dollar. If there were an economic crisis, I suspect the value of precious-metals would rise considerably. I think that strong precious-metal equities, namely Canadian junior miners, would perform even better (although picking the right ones is a very risky business).  
  
No doubt my post has already betrayed the fact that I am no expert investor, but hopefully it illustrates a general investment thesis. If there's even a 15 percent chance that an economic crisis is coming, I want to have my head on straight before things go haywire like in 2008.  
  
Thanks for reading! I'd love to read your ideas on where the money will be made in the event of an economic crisis/collapse, or any reputable sources relating to the topic. Dad is looking to allocate $20-30k of his 401k to hedge against financial disaster.",4

I’m writing about the election and retirement investments. The majority of Americans--anyone with around $1 or 2 million to invest or less--hold most of their assets in equities, often because their savings are in retirement products. Analysts expect at least some degree of market volatility ahead of the 2016 presidential election, which could impact these investors’ portfolios. Financial advisers usually urge taking a long term view, and not to making changes to investments based on Geo-political events. However, with the many unprecedented elements at play in this presidential election, some investors and advisers are taking unique steps to safeguard against or capitalize on market volatility. Investors: have you made changes to your investment portfolio this election year and never before? What changes did you make? Have you moved into investments that protect against risk (core holdings, S&amp;P 500 index fund, and large cap holding w/ value orientation, Vanguard High dividend yield ETF)? Are you staying put or have you moved into stocks that you think could benefit from a relief rally? Are you holding more cash than you typically do or have in past election cycles? Have you asked an adviser for help? Advisers: are you finding yourselves making suggestions you’ve never made before?

I would love to hear your investing and election stories. If you have something to share but would rather do so privately, feel free to DM me. Thanks! Elizabeth",16

I benefit from having a lot of career security in my current position, and I also have access to the military savings programs, as well. I was wondering if I should just invest in those programs and maintain a conservative plan. 

I am interested in trading as a hobby (ex. I have a Robinhood account). How would one value the options of individual trading, the military programs, and 401k programs, etc.?

Edit: I am not risk averse.

16-06-22,4paq15,SERIOUS: Need help understanding what I should do with a ITM Call Option,"I made a good ""call"" on a few INTC options a few weeks back.
JUL 15 2016 31.00 C to be exact. I purchased at ~0.50 a piece and they are now up ~%250 percent to date. They are ~3 weeks out and want to hold my ground as I know that they should expire ITM but I want to understand how hard/easy it will be to get rid of these option contracts as we approach the expire date. I know that time decay will act on the option as they get closer to expire, but if the IV is high enough, the loss for theta should be minimal (I assume, it will not close below strike + (Actual price - strike price) is that correct?) Basically, if you do ""win big"" on option contracts, how hard is it to actually ""claim your prize?"" How can I gauge this? Open interest? Can somebody explain? ",0

I can't seem to think of a way to find out how good of a proxy that a specific ETF's closing price mirrors the LMBA/GOLD US pm price. I tried a few different methods to test if the percentage change day to day the same, but I am getting some weird results. And my searching around for how the proxy EFTs are structured to mirror the LMBA gold bullion pricing hasn't yielded much of anything remotely near a mathematical answer.


Basically I was just wondering what is the Gold EFT stock price that mirrors the gold bullion price best? I would imagine that /r/investing would have a better answer than any of the data analysis or data science subs for this topic.

I ran an element-wise correlation test for each day of data I have and got that the cor(LMBA[US pm], AMEX_GLD)=~0.8506, meanwhile the cor(LMBA[US pm], GOLD)=~0.6406.

Meaning that the ticker:GLD has a constant 85% correlation with LMBA gold movements, this could partially be attributed to differences in the holidays and the day after where either stock would 'jump' to match the one which did not have the holiday.",0

# Description
Archer-Daniels-Midland is a processor of oilseeds, corn, wheat, cocoa and other agricultural commodities and a manufacturer of protein meal, vegetable oil, corn sweeteners, flour, biodiesel, ethanol, and other food and feed ingredients. The Company's segments include Agricultural Services; Corn Processing; and Oilseeds Processing.

Bunge and Ingredion seen to be the closest competitors that I can find, but I've added a range of more consumer facing food processors to the analysis. The tiny operating margin is the key differentiator. And returns of equity are clearly lower than the less commodity like food processors.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Archer Daniels Midland Company | $64,580M | 4% | 9%
Bunge Ltd | $41,565M | 4% | 11%
Campbell Soup Company | $7,967M | 20% | 44%
ConAgra Foods Inc | $12,915M | 16% | 18%
General Mills, Inc. | $16,934M | 21% | 29%
Ingredion Inc | $5,651M | 16% | 20%
Kellogg Company | $13,364M | 19% | 25%
Kraft Heinz Co | $22,430M | 22% | 2%
Mondelez International Inc | $28,329M | 17% | 29%

Archer Daniels Midland Company has $5,415M of net debt. That is 2x it's latest operating profit. Not scary, but still, a figure to watch!

The professionals on Wall Street have a $41.50 for ADM which is 2% below the current price. So no surprise their recommendation to their clients is HOLD.

# Valuation
The following table shows the key valuation metrics

This is a sector with reasonable dividends but patchy growth forecasts. A straight comparison of $ADM to $BG shows Bunge to appear to be better value on price and growth as well as having higher free-cash-flow yield. In fact, it's surprising to me that the commodity agriculture food processors have better FCF yield that the consumer stocks.

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/adm/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------|
$ADM | $24,943M | 17x | 3% | 3% | 12%
$BG | $8,640M | 11x | 10% | 2% | 16%
$CPB | $19,263M | 21x | 7% | 2% | 7%
$CAG | $20,546M | 22x | 7% | 2% | 7%
$GIS | $39,159M | 23x | 5% | 3% | 8%
$INGR | $8,942M | 19x | 2% | 2% | 9%
$K | $26,905M | 21x | 4% | 3% | 7%
$KHC | $103,964M | 28x | 20% | 3% | 4%
$MDLZ | $68,648M | 24x | 11% | 2% | 13%

# Dividends

ADM is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.20 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $1.14 per share. So it's growing! And if you are worried about volatility, well, EPS forecast is $2.46 a share, so the payout ratio isn't excessive.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 13% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -3%. The good run is a little surprising given the sales over the last 3 months are down 18% and earnings off 53%. Sure the agricultural commodities industry is super volatile, but that's quite a ride!

Perhaps the optimism comes from the [latest earnings conference call with investors](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3970735-archer-daniels-midland-adm-juan-ricardo-luciano-q1-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single):

&gt; We would remain on track to achieve our 15% to 20% operating profit growth target for 2016. In the second quarter, we expect some modest underlying growth on a year-over-year basis and we'll continue to see some additional startup costs. Our growth will be more concentrated in the second half based upon the pattern of new business and synergy realizations, the startup of Campo Grande, as well as the avoidance of some unique one-time costs incurred last year.

capital to finance future losses rather than future returns. The assumption in this dynamic is that
the future losses will be covered by a second capital raise (similarly pyramidal) which will allow
some investors to exit profitably, although many will reinvest and / or accept losses.

16-06-21,4p4w3d,Wal-Mart is arguably undervalued,"I've spent a good amount of time going through Wal-Mart SEC filings the past several days. I know you guys don't like reading a wall of serious research so I'll keep it short and sweet. 

Company has plenty of cash and cash equivalents. They have a favorable debt position. Increasing investments in property and equipment. Their cash flow from operations is solid and they don't need to rely on financing cash flows to pay the bills. Solid dividend and they have pretty expansive geographic coverage. 

Now here's why I think this is all important. Wal-Mart took a shit a little while back, shareholders lost money and everyone is like oh no muhh cash. Perfect,   they are so cheap right now it isn't even funny. A P/E ratio below 16, compare that to Amazons 560+ P/E. We all know Wal-Mart is not Amazon, obviously, but it doesn't take a genius to figure out they already took a hit from seemingly like they were behind and Amazon is their largest (albeit different) competitor.

Wal-Mart is poised to have tremendous gains from the adaptation of smart technology. Increasing use of automation has the potential to streamline their processes and increase their efficiency overall with of course large upfront costs. They are in a position where pursuing this is a necessity, especially with Amazon looming on the corner swinging it's dick at Wal-Mart shareholders. 

Now you could argue that Amazons P/E ratio reflects all the benefits from rapid expansion of automation and technology, at this point it seems that Wal-Mart's does not. This is where they are undervalued. 

Personally with upcoming automation and technological improvements I'm seeking out areas that will benefit from this the most given that I'll probably be out of a job in 25 years and nobody can rely on UBI being feasible or implemented. I think Wal-Mart is at a point where it is cheap, and it can really take advantage of automation since it already has expansive distribution and other facilities. The ground work is there and I bet my ass they are moving towards utilizing their current networks and improving them with automation. 

Personally I want a piece of the automation pie. This is just one of many avenues I am taking to get their. Make your own choice, but I'll bet Wal-Mart will be above  $100/share by the end of Q1 next year. 

TL;DR: if this wasn't short enough for you, Wal-Mart will be above $100/share in less than a year.",23

I'm considering more actively managing (not going too crazy until I'm more comfortable with trading) my retirement than the 401(k) and the old job allowed for.

I have about $20,000 in the account and was wondering which platform would you consider the best and why?

I'm intrigued by Interactive Brokers since it looks to have a powerful platform and generally cheap commissions for a relatively active trader (which I intend to become through time). What worries me is the restrictions on IRA accounts. I'm also curious if the $20k the IRA would have allow for non-IRA trading within IB as well.

For those that are trying emulate or follow Warren Buffett, the secret doesn't lie in following his 13F - which shows what public stocks Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway - i.e. Coca-Cola, American Express, IBM - rather, it's understanding how he turned Berkshire into a powerhouse. 

Basically the TL;DR of it is - Buffett used insurance float, specifically by investing and buying property and casualty insurance companies. The takeaway is that there are underrated P&amp;C companies out there that look like a young Berkshire. 

Some of the how Buffett ""did"" it - He didn't have redemption requests or pressure from limited partners because he had permanent capital from insurers. Plus, he was able to leverage the insurance capital beyond traditional debt standards because it was lower risk. 

Buffett doesn't really outline the 'how' when it comes to shareholder letters. There are a handful of pages from one letter in the mid-2000s that really kind of lays Buffett's thoughts on P&amp;C insurers and how to leverage them to make other investments (i.e. Coke). 

All in all - the moral appears that there could be some P&amp;C insurers that look like early Berkshire Hathaways, where the market overlooks their compounding power - much like they did in the early 70s - not fully understanding Berkshire’s compounding power. 

What are your guys thoughts on where to find these P&amp;Cs? Any P&amp;C experts here?

I have come up with an alternative plan what about shipping food off the coast of Florida in shipping box's with enough of an eclectic combination to cover one village for at least a month have at least a 30% up charge on the food due to supply constraints. I'm going to do some calculations, research local cuisine, import/export tariffs and shipping costs. I'll post if people think this is remotely a descent idea or just to fucked up to even contemplate!


Edit: Yes, I am making money. No, this is not a fucking donation I'd rather burn the food then give it away they have money this is just a food shortage. 

So I had some fun with this last night. 

Conservative estimate we could get around $30k to $50k of food per cargo container @20ft long. Shipping charges are between like $1.00 to $4.00 a mile! 1,609 miles from Miami to Venezuela. We could rent a chopper to bring the cargo containers back and forth to more remote areas for like $2500 an hour. Security personal would be contract based say $25k local security for the month.

# Description
Bank of America Corporation is a bank holding and financial holding company. The Company is a financial institution, serving individual consumers, small- and middle-market businesses, institutional investors, corporations and governments with various banking, investing, asset management and other financial and risk management products and services. 

I always find it hard to judge what are the best metrics for a bank :( so suggestions appreciated. 

Clearing, looking at RoE, $BAC is the poor cousin of $JPM and $WFC.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|
Bank of America Corp | $49,532M | 6%
Citigroup Inc | $58,118M | 7%
HSBC Holdings plc (ADR) | $32,170M | 6%

U.S. Bancorp | $12,562M | 14%
Wells Fargo &amp; Co | $50,286M | 12%

# Wall Street says?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $17.45 for BAC, which implies an upside of 28% to their target. So guess... yes, their recommendation to clients is *Buy*.

# Valuation

The following table shows the key valuation metrics for the large peers. Any I should add?

For me, it's surprising that Citi's growth is so low. Are it's emerging market operations dragging it down at the moment, not lifting it? Similarly the divie at HSBC looks excessively high. If I was a bottom feeder, I might prefer them to $BAC.

Companies|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|
|--------:|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|
$BAC | $139,904M | 10x | 7% | 2% 
$C | $125,967M | 9x | 4% | 1% 
$HSBC | $128,038M | 10x | 1% | 8% 
$JPM | $230,187M | 11x | 6% | 3% 
$USB | $71,421M | 13x | 5% | 3% 
$WFC | $239,789M | 12x | 9% | 3% 

# Dividends

$BAC is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.27 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $0.20 per share. Which is a pretty nice growth to get. And with earnings forecast of $1.31 there looks like lots of round in the future.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 0% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -8%. That's a little concerning. 

With BAC seeing interest income decreased 2% to $11.7B in the last 3 months. Net interest income after loan loss provision decreased 5% to $8.17B.  Net income applicable to common stockholders decreased 18% to $2.3B. 

Though perhaps the tightening cycle is the driver to watch? For $BAC and the rest of the sector?

16-06-22,4pc25y,$SWHC to $29 by beginning of August,"Made a post yesterday about SWHC to $26 by first week in July, but I've dug into it a little more and I can see this puppy soaring.  I now can see SWHC to $29+ by the first week in August and here's why:

I have a buddy who just graduated from Princeton, he wrote his senior thesis on the impact mass murders has on gun stocks, RGR and SWHC. To keep it short, he found that gun stocks rise in the months following a mass shooting (statistically significant at 99% level or there is a positive correlation between mass shootings and gun stock prices), and then he looked into why that happens. It comes down to two things, people stock pile guns following a mass shooting in anticipation of heightened gun legislation and any gun control reform, or two; people who are pro-guns but don't own guns will be more inclined to purchase a gun following a mass shooting because they feel the need to protect themselves or be more prepared. To pair with that, gun owners are more inclined to purchase more and/or different guns after a mass shooting because they too feel the need to protect their families and themselves. 

With that being said its trading at 25.51 currently, and that is before background check numbers are released, which will be the next indicator of increased or decreased sales. Background checks will be much higher for the month of June due to the Orlando shooting. It might drop a little but hold steady around $24-$26 into next week, we might see that drop this coming thursday, in anticipation of background check numbers following week. But if my friends research is correct, we should see an increased background check number for the month of June because of the Orlando shooting, which will mean an increase of sales, which will increase the price of gun stocks. so if it stays around $25 until numbers are released, and background numbers are positive, I can see it up around $27 after background numbers come out, and then trading $27&amp;28 in anticipation of Ruger's numbers which come out end of July, and if Ruger beats projected earnings, it would mean an increase of sales, and SWHC is positively correlated with RGR(buddies research), so if we see an increase in RGR, we will see an increase in SWHC, which would bring it to about $29 in the beginning of August. And we can expect that RGR will see an increase of sales for the month of June due to the shooting which will aid them in their earnings beat, which will also prop up SWHC stock. 

Then I know SWHC next earnings report is the end of August, so if trading stays relatively flat through August and no crazy legislation comes into play, we hope to see a BIG earnings beat come end of August because of the aftermath of the Orlando shooting, which then would push the stock above $30. 


Right now I am in two positions, $25 SP expiring July 16th and $26 SP July 16th contract, and $27 SP August 16th contract that are all doing well.

However, I am feeling that I sell off my $25 SP contracts and then reinvest in $27 and $28 september 16th contracts, and all the research holds, I will be seeing a $$$BIG$$$ return. I will keep you guys updated on any moves I pull. If you want to talk more in depth message me and we can shoot the shit.

16-06-23,4pen8a,"Poor 401(k) fund choices, high ERs. Need some clarity on total returns.","Currently, I put about 5% of my pretax salary in my 401(k). There's no match, but there is profit sharing. I do invest in taxable accounts in a more risky manner (I read WSB), but with retirement I tend to be more conservative and stick with lower-cost, mostly passive funds. 

Anyway, I am having trouble with the funds that I'm presented with in my 401(k). My main goal is to widen my exposure while keeping the number of funds I am in to a minimum and my expense ratios down. There are two index funds: one for the S&amp;P 500 (at .36% ER) and an international index for large cap international equities from developed markets (.41% ER). The rest are active funds, and currently I also have the following funds in my portfolio as well as their expense ratio:

- Large Cap Global Return (1.4% ER): I am getting rid of this and moving to the international index.

- Mid-Cap Value Fund (.9% ER)

- Small Cap Value Fund (1.52% ER)

- Developing Markets Fund (1.56% ER)

- Intermediate Bond Fund (1.10% ER)

Like I said, I want to increase my exposure to more different markets/sectors with a higher upside, but these ERs are legit killing me. Is it worth the possible extra return from (for example) small cap or developing markets, or are the ERs so high that in the future I'm still better off being in these larger cap domestic and international index funds?",2

16-06-22,4pchjm,The Parable of the Talents: The Bible and YOLO,"The following is an excerpt taken from the WSB annotated version of the New Testament.

The Book of Matthew, chapter 24, verses 14-30:

*“For it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted to them his property. 15 To one he gave five talents (a talent is a unit roughly equivalent to 75lb, so a gold talent would roughly equal ~$1.25 million.), to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability.*

The text isn't clear how he determined who got what; it seems to indicate that it was directly correlated with their ""ability"". Since he was most likely Roman we can assume that asset allotment was directly correlated with their ability to suck/take dick. And while the scripture does call them ""servants"" let's be real, these were slaves, and from my extensive research watching Spartacus: Blood and Sand, slave basically equates to walking pocket pussy. At that time, the general consensus on fagotry seemed to be that ""holes-is-holes"". This lines up with both my personal motto and the WSB creed.

*Then he went away. 16 He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more. 17 So also he who had the two talents made two talents more.*

Again, we don't have a clear picture of what they were trading to see these returns. Biotechs where pretty scarce, from what I can gather you were pretty much limited to a witch doctor field testing which plants helped you shit yourself less. That's too risky for me, and my entire portfolio is currently in MSTX and INO.

*18 But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money.*

/r/investing mod material

*19 Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. 20 And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me five talents; here I have made five talents more.’* *21 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’ 22 And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me two talents; here I have made two talents more.’ 23 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’ *

Not sure what 'Enter into the joy of your master"" means, but it sounds like these guys got to pitch for once so good for them.

*24 He also who had received the one talents came forward, saying, ‘Master, I knew you to be a hard man (giggity), reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed, 25 so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talents in the ground. Here you have what is yours.’ 26 But his master answered him, ‘You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I scattered no seed? 27 Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest. 28 So take the talents from him and give it to him who has the ten talents. 29 For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. 30 And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’*

The ending is kind of harsh, but overall a good lesson in investment, one that WSB should be able to appreciate. The whole point of this is to highlight that the YOLO mentality is supported by the best-selling book in history, so the recent ""advice"" from /u/martinshkreli just screams false prophet. Ever heard the phrase ""Take no thought for tomorrow""? Matthew 6:34. If that isn't YOLO I don't know what is.

Frankly, the Bible is absolutely full of good, practical YOLO advice. I'm working on a thesis that Christ's original purpose was a long play at shorting the Roman solidus. If finance wasn't his angle then why would he choose to be born a Jew?. It wasn't until around age 12-13 that he realized the real money was in religion and spent the next 20 years building Christianity to ultimately force the Jews into a buyout or merger, eventually the top Jews caught on and had him killed to squash out a competing religion, aka revenue.",0

How do you buy gold that is easily traded like other equities?

A step by step explanation would be highly appreciated!

Let's say I have 10,000 sitting in my BofA account, and I intend to invest that in gold. What are the steps to make that happen? 

A follow up question: if for some reason I wanted the 10,000 dollar worth of gold to be physically in front of me, is it possible to redeem your 10,000 USD investment in gold for actual physical gold? If it is possible to get actual gold from your investment, what would be the steps to make that happen?

I am just genuinely curious and felt people in this subreddit might know the answer to this question. Please don't get offended or angry, I apologize beforehand if I have somehow upset someone reading this. 

TL;DR: What is the step-by-step process to buy gold for investment. What is the process to turn that investment into actual, tangible gold? ",17
16-06-23,4pf6hh,Yahoo Spin off,"Quick and dirty:


* YHOO Market value: 35.5B


* Alibaba Market value: 196.5B


* Yahoo Japan Market Value: 25.7B


* Ownership in Alibaba: 15% or 29.5B


* Ownership in Yahoo Japan: 35.5% or 9.12B


So excluding its core internet business which is one of the most visited sites on the web (top 3 in 2015. not sure YTD but have seen top 6), Yahoo is undervalued by AT LEAST $3B. As well, they have received a 'low ball' offer for its core biz of $3B so that means its current market value is $6B below its estimated value.


Why should I not buy this company before it is spun off/sold? Are the tax implications for spinning off the $BABA stake really as steep ($12billion hit) as the news is making it out to be?


What other factors should I be looking at?

16-06-22,4pd063,My [F]irst time. Be Gentle. [BREXIT OPTIONS PLAY],"Ok. It’s actually my thirty[F]irst time posting here, but I know you fucks only like to follow advice from investing virgins. Seems every time I see some really shitty advice from someone who has clearly only been trading a month, you guys pile-on. So lets just pretend for this one post…

&amp;nbsp;

On to the actual advice. Frankly, this is likely only helpful to those who are new to trading options as it should be blatantly obvious to anyone with some experience. 

&amp;nbsp;

Long story short, with the Brexit vote coming up, Vol has popped nicely. High Vol usually means it’s a good time to write options, in this case I’m talking on SPY specifically. Now, you’re thinking to yourself “Mr. Cudgeler, how do I know which options to sell.” Well, it depends on a few things but in this case its pretty obvious. The IV of Puts is huge compared to that of Calls. Calls aren’t getting enough premium to make it worth selling vs the risk in my opinion. Puts, on the other hand, are priced extremely high currently. For example, a $201 strike put expiring June 24 is selling for about $.70 a contract right now. That means, in laymans terms, unless SPY moves more than 3.3% to the downside by FRIDAY, the put will expire worthless, leaving you with $70 for every put you wrote. I like those odds.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, this is kind of a reverse YOLO. Instead of putting a bunch of money on a single bet with the hopes of striking it rich, you are making a small-but-guaranteed amount of money up front, with the hopes of not totally losing your ass. 
Anyways, as I said, be gentle. Im sure a majority of you know everything I’ve written above already, but figured it would be a good quick lesson in Vol for those new to the dark art of options.

And because talking to officials is important in order to get a whole picture of the company's situation in supplement with financial data of course, wouldn't it be foolish to do these simulators if you did not talk to them when making the decision?

I currently have a mixed portfolio of ~75% equities, ~10% bonds, ~10% REITs, and 5% gold. I'm interested in levering this portfolio very moderately through my margin on IB.

However, this is my concern: seems if you decide you want to lever your portfolio by a specific percentage, then as the value of your securities increases, you need to buy more assets to maintain the leverage level; and as the value of your securities falls, then you would need to sell assets to maintain the leverage level. Doesn't this necessarily result in you buying high and selling low while re-balancing? What is the best practice here? Would it make more sense to just lever by a specific dollar amount at the start and then maintain that amount in dollar terms when re-balancing?

Anyone else in a similar situation? Thanks in advance for any suggestions!

16-06-24,4pkepr,"Brexit Impact on S&amp;P","Full text: http://seekingalpha.com/article/3983467-s-and-p-500-fear-brexit

&gt;The prevailing sentiment is that the pound (GBB, FXB) will crash if the U.K. does exit EU. With Soros warning of another Black Wednesday, understandably everyone is getting nervous. I see two problems with this hypothesis. First I disagree that the pound ""will definitely crash"" if U.K. exits the EU. The environment that led to the collapse of the pound sterling back in 1992 is completely different from today's circumstances. At the time, the government was actively supporting the currency, and when the support was withdrawn, the pound tanked. A similar situation happened with the Swiss Franc in 2015. The opposite happened (currency appreciated), but the circumstances were similar as the cause was the removal of the peg (i.e., no more support). Today, the pound is floating against both the euro and the dollar, there is no pent-up pressure. And that's not all. The swap lines opened by the ECB will effectively provide unlimited liquidity in both currencies (euro and pound) to European banks (coined the ""Draghi Put""). This will address any liquidity issues that could lead to the collapse of the pound, which would further perpetuate the panic selling as investors dump their pound denominated assets (however unwarranted). In summary, not only is there a lack of pressure on the pound to begin with, the exchange rate will also be supported with unlimited funds. These factors cast serious doubts on whether the pound will fall at all.

&gt; The second problem relates to what would happen if the pound did crash. Save a subset of the market, I believe that there would be no impact whatsoever. The percentage of S&amp;P 500 companies' revenue generated in the U.K. was less than 1% in 2014, meaning that currency impact will be insignificant to the market as a whole. In addition, any damages suffered by international companies would most likely be translation losses (i.e., one-time). The dollar denominated profit will shrink (if the pound depreciates), but the actual amount of pounds earned will not change. Revenue will still be generated in pounds and expenses will still be incurred in pounds. A profitable business in the U.K. will remain profitable regardless of how the pound moves.

Around 560m marketcap, public since the late nineties with fantastic returns so far.  They're a MA based company that does protective materials for construction and industrial uses.  A large segment of their business appears to be based on electronics materials.  Stock is currently around an all time high and returned over 50% the last year and has a 1.04% div and 19.86 P/E.  EPS growth of 68% last quarter compared to last year.

# Description
Carter's, Inc. is a marketer of apparel for babies and young children in the United States and Canada. The Company operates through five segments: Carter's Retail, Carter's Wholesale, OshKosh Retail, OshKosh Wholesale and International.

Metric | 2015A | 2014A | 2013A | 2012A | 2011A
:--------|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:
Revenue | $3.0bn | $2.9bn | $2.6bn | $2.4bn | $2.1bn
Cash EPS | $4.50 | $3.62 | $2.75 | $2.69 | $1.94

# Competitors

According to its SEC filing it sees its competitors as 

&gt; Our primary competitors in the wholesale channel include private label product offerings, and, in alphabetical order, Disney and Gerber. Our primary competitors in the retail channel include, in alphabetical order, Disney, Gap, Gymboree, Old Navy, and The Children's Place.

Now, I've not included Disney, as it's stock is more media and merchandising driven, but I've added in some of the large apparel companies for comparison.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Carter's, Inc. | $3,053M | 15% | 29%
Childrens Place Inc | $1,740M | 10% | 12%
Gap Inc | $15,578M | 12% | 30%
Hanesbrands Inc. | $5,742M | 13% | 39%
Under Armour Inc | $4,206M | 13% | 15%
VF Corp | $12,379M | 16% | 25%

Carter's, Inc. has $185M of net debt. That is 0.4x it's latest operating profit. So no concerns there.

# And the Professionals Say:

The professionals on Wall Street have a $113.33 for Carter's, and that implies an upside of 9% to their target. Their recommendation to clients is *Buy*. 

# Valuation

The following table shows the key valuation metrics. The two children's plays in the table, CRI and PLCE are at the high-end of the valuation and growth end. And Under Armour looks like an outlier. How come $UA is worth 3 times $CRI when it has only a third more sales?

Companies|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|--------:|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------|
$CRI | $5,302M | 20x | 12% | 1% | 7%
$PLCE | $1,425M | 18x | 12% | 1% | 10%
$GPS | $8,202M | 11x | 6% | 4% | 21%
$HBI | $9,944M | 14x | 10% | 2% | 7%
$UA | $15,664M | 63x | 24% | 0% | 3%
$VFC | $26,894M | 20x | 11% | 2% | 7%

Here's the comparison of sales v $UA

Metric | 2015A | 2014A | 2013A | 2012A | 2011A
:--------|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:
$CRI Revenue | $3.0bn | $2.9bn | $2.6bn | $2.4bn | $2.1bn
$UA Revenue | $4.0bn | $3.1bn | $2.3bn | $1.8bn | $1.5bn

Hmm....different business.

# Dividends

Carter's, Inc. is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.33 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $0.99 per share.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 3% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 1%. So little change in earnings or sentiment recently. Nice to see that their recent sales, up 6% to $724m in the quarter, were driven by US up 5% to $646m and International up 14%. 

Is there a good international growth story to come?

Here's what a fellow redditor said, when suggesting we feature $CRI

&gt; * Children's apparel retailer under the ""Carter's"" and ""Osh Kosh"" brands
&gt; * market leader in the US and Canadian children's apparel market over its competitors Children's Place and other smaller brands
&gt; * strong positive sentiment from Wall Street, curently 96% institutionally owned
&gt; * exciting catalysts: expanding in to China; plans to open 200 new retail stores in the next few years despite the challenges most retail companies are facing in brick and mortar stores; recently raised their EPS forecast for the remainder of the year

1.  Buy solid stocks.  Look to Dow components, particularly the energy majors - oil is way off in addition to the general market pressure

2.  If you're going to buy options, do not buy a week or two weeks out - we have no idea when this gap down will reverse but it will reverse.  Pay more and go a month out to ensure you win.  But be careful and make sure you don't also go past a company's earnings date (they're coming up) because they you have that risk too

3.  If you want to YOLO just buy what will be very OTM SPY calls - we're going to gap down 75 points as of now so buy calls that are 50 points above something like that",71

16-06-23,4phs31,$PGNX - Some shit DD,"Let's talk about Progenics Pharma.


Overview


PGNX is a small cap (327M) biotech that's currently trading around 4.7 a share. They are know for their cancer products and have a very specific focus on prostate cancer, which is a extremely common cancer that kills 1 in 39 men every year. 


Financials


This company has absolutely no fucking debt. For being a low cap biotech this is pretty exciting, since they also have 66M in cash just sitting around to use. I'm not to skilled in the heavy TA department, but I can tell you the company has a 18.6% short float and and average 3m volume of 810K with 70M shares outstanding. The dollar volume is really shit, but were not here for the technicals becuase its all fugazi.


Pipeline


The pipeline is solid right now. They have got a few oncology drugs going through phase 2 - phase 3 trials such as Small Molecule Diagnostic 1404, which is a diagnostic tool specifically developed for prostate cancer imaging. You can read about the rest on their website becuase I'm not really playing this long term. But the main catalyst here is the oral version of Relistor, which treats the source of constipation caused by opioids without affecting the pain relief from opioid therapy. Drugs like this are not new to the world, however it's approval is going to push PGNX to at least $7 a share when it gets approved. 


The Future


The PDUFA for oral Relistor is July 19th and it's going to be approved no problem. The FDA even said ""Among the opioid receptor antagonists in development for OIC, Relistor has been the most extensively evaluated in the nonclinical, clinical, and post-marketing settings"". So now I'm going to predict the future. Once this get approved, were going to be looking at a potential buyout for PGNX. At such a small market cap lots of big companys are going to try to get them. While VRX is working with PGNX on the marketing and distribution of Relistor through a satellite company they are not a likely contender to buy because their company right now is the financial equivalent of a dumpster fire. My best guess for a buyout would be Pfizer (PFE) since its oncology department isnt really up to par with the other big dogs like Novartis (NVS), Amgen (AMGN) or Roche (ROG). Other possible buyout candidates are AbbVie (ABBV), Biogen Idec (BIIB), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), and Sanofi (SNY). I think after Relistor gets approved, we will see

I planned on buying $150k worth of Fidelity funds last week to meet my overhauled asset allocations. I was going to break it up into 3 different investment chunks and buy FSTVX (Fidelity Total Us Fund). I purchased $50k last week and now have $100k more on the sideline.

With BREXIT and the possibility that British leaves the EU, now could be a great time to pump the rest in.

Should the market drop, how many days would you wait for it to bottom out or % loss before pumping in the next $50k or full $100 chunk?

I'm still pretty new to all these trading strategies so bare with me and please tell me if i'm right or wrong.

In early May, there was a large sell off in shares and jump in share volume only to be followed by another sell off (my guess is that it was probably weak investors). 

Also, from the April 27 to the low of May 9th, there is a 30-33% decrease in price. From that point on, higher highs and higher lows have been set and can be seen in the base. Volume also appears to be higher than it was prior to May.

There has also been a change in management for the company.

Please give me your opinions on how I am analyzing this stock. 

Much appreciated.

Currently, i use Debt/Equity Ratio (should be &lt;0.50), Current Ratio (i like a ratio between 1.50-2.00), it must have long term prospects such as a foreseeable future which is easier on CGT as you'd hold for longer without the fear of the company going bankrupt.
I'd also look at how the book value/share and EPS change through the year and see if there's a trend rather than random numbers going all over the place so that the future may be easier to predict.

I've been told to use P/E Ratio, POE, Intrinsic Value etc. but i'm not sure if they're any good because as i mentioned i'm novice. I watched a video on YouTube from 2011 where the guy was using Intrinsic Value and my other methods to value Disney over a few years.

My bets are that GBP/USD is going to about 1.25 when the Holy Fuck our City is screwed hysteria kicks in.

16-06-24,4pphiu,"What determines a stock's price? (In the most direct sense)","I know the list of things that influence a stocks price is quite large: the company's earnings, the economy, the company's product, the industry, consumer behavior, etc. and ultimately supply and demand.

But that's not what I mean.  In a very direct sense, what is it that causes the price to go up or down after a trade.  This seems like the most basic and elementary question yet I can't find a straight answer... My (uneducated) guess is that there's some sort of computer algorithm that automatically adjusts the price after a trade? (perhaps if a share is for sale and goes unsold, the price steadily declines till it is sold?) If so, is this algorithm produced by the company, the stock exchange, or what?

I hope you understand what I mean and don't give me an answer like ""supply and demand"".  I'm looking for the most basic direct thing (or person) that changes the stock price.  Thanks in advance for the help.",10

I, along with everybody else, learned in school that gold is supposed to be an inflation hedge. That is reflected in the price decrease during the brief period of deflation in 2009, but inflation does not explain the large price movement between 2000-now. What other factors affect gold? Why didn't I learn about it in economics class?

16-06-24,4pmjdv,AAR of my Brexit volatility play,"Several days ago I posted the following:

&gt;I've been very tempted to buy volatility ($TVIX or $UVXY) [note - I then purchased $TVIX] in anticipation of Brexit. Not that I think Brexit will happen, mind, but because I believe the potential upside is huge. 

&gt;Efficient market theorists would have one believe that the possibility of Brexit has already been priced into the market. To a certain degree, this is undoubtably true. However, markets are run by people, and people are emotional, squirrely, and far from omniscient.

&gt;One of the lasting lessons I took from reading Antifragile by Taleb was that there can be massive upsides to betting against the market. Let us consider the original question: Whether to buy or sell volatility in anticipation of Brexit, regardless of whether we think it will happen. 

&gt;At the moment, polling suggests (and the markets seem to believe) that Brexit will not happen. If the polls and markets are correct, when the votes are tallied tomorrow and Britain remains in the EU the markets should not move much. There will perhaps be a few twitches as traders breathe sighs of relief, but meeting expectations is not big business. Selling volatilty, then, in anticipation of ""Bremain,"" is unlikely to have a large upside.

&gt;On the other hand, consider that the British defy expectations and vote to leave the EU. Panic and fear will likely take hold of the markets, and volatility will almost certainly spike as traders buy options in order to protect themselves. Buying volatilty, then, is likely to have a much larger upside, even though it is the less likely outcome. 

&gt;The math becomes simple. In basic probability, the formula to determine an expected outcome is as follows:

    [(probability of winning)(amount won per bet) - (probability of losing)(amount lost per bet)]


&gt;Let's say we choose to buy $1,000 worth of volatility ETFs or ETNs, in hopes that Britain will leave the EU. We can expect a 10% loss ($100) if Britain stays, as the market settles and becomes less volatile. If Britain leaves, however, we can expect a 40% gain ($400), which is not unreasonable if we purchased a leveraged ETN like $TVIX. After looking at the odds, we think there's a 3/4 chance that Britain will remain in the union and a 1/4 chance it will leave. We win if Britain leaves. 

&gt;The math becomes:

&gt;25% chance of $400 gain - 75% chance of $100 loss = +$25. 

&gt;Even if we think that Britain will remain in the EU, then, it can make sense to bet on Brexit. 

Obviously Britain did vote to leave the EU, and my play was successful -- UVXY and TVIX are both up ~40% in premarket trading.

Things to improve:  

* in aftermarket trading before the referendum was counted, volatility dropped by about 20%. The potential downside was larger than I had accounted for  

* part of the reason for the huge spike in volatility was because most polls pointed to remain. This strategy may not work if Brexit had been the expectation

Things that went well:  

* my underlying hypothesis -- that brexit was *not* priced into the market -- was clearly vindicated


I'd like to see your comments, suggestions for improvement, or whining. ",2

1) Will the pound take a permanent hit or is this temporary? 

2) What UK companies should I invest in?

-companies that sell cheap items without imports.  

-companies that export to countries outside of the UK. These companies will see an increase in sales as their price will be based on a currency that has depreciated outside of the UK.

3) What non-UK companies should I invest in?

-Avoid companies that have a lot of sales in the UK


What I was thinking about purchasing:

1) [Gregg](https://www.google.com/finance?q=LON:GRG): This is a UK pastry company that seems to be fairly reliable.

16-06-24,4ppyey,"Student, Coop Program, Looking For Advise and Areas to Research","Hi everyone! 

Was looking for areas to invest in given my current situation :

- Only 1 year trading experience
- Initial Capital of 6 -  15k (depends on what I find,  currently 6k invested in market)  
- Looking for a medium term position (up to 2 years) 
- 13k student loan that we begin to collect interest in Q4 2018 (loan value won't change) 
- Alternate every 4 months between school and work 
- Primary intent is to move money from my low interest savings account,  as well as my paychecks after living expenses (1.5k/month),  into the market
- By nature I am VERY risk averse. Trying to get a little it of my comfort zone. 
- Currently work two jobs,  the second is only part time. Using that money for personal interests. Willing to invest it instead,  ideally in a low risk,  high liquid stock/fund.

Goal:

- Lower end of the risk spectrum,   fixed income generating portfolio 

- I just wanted to put my hard earned money to work for me,  I'm not looking for returns I can brag about. I feel dumb dumping my cash in my low interest savings account and taking advantage of petty bank promotions when there's so many other options. I just don't know where to start. 

- My personal goal is to have enough capital saved the day I graduate to pay off my loan and start from 0 =) 

In my recent experience I have found that I will not panic; I keep an emergency fund that always covers tuition for the coming semester. 
For example,  I didn't loose sleep when A energy Company (TSE: TA)  I bought a while back lost over 50% of its value (since recovered), I am still holding it and collecting dividends. 

I really like Canadian banks and would love to take advantage of the Brexit situation (TSE: CM is on my radar,  dropped 2.5% after British vote). I currently own shares of TSE: TD. 

I'm just looking for anyones thoughts or advise. Anything really. I just like to learn about finance and money. Thanks!

I want to share little bit of advice before I start this thread off. Skip to the first emboldened ticker if you don't give a fuck. 

This sub has grown a lot since I first started posting here. WSB has always been shit, but more people knew the difference between a good YOLO and straight up gambling. I've made calls on solid companies and raked in plenty of money. Lots of people in WSB have. I actually specialize in Biotech &amp; Pharma, so I know how much more money there is to be made on a positive FDA approval. Companies like these that I invest in have solid research and data backing them up, but even then I always keep in mind the true reality of this field: **FDA and Clinical Trial results will always come down to chance.** 

So when you think you have a good pick on some $0.40/share company that doesn't have a single source of revenue and is funding multiple clinical trials that are months or years away from commercialization, be well prepared to lose 100% of your money. This isn't because smaller companies have a lesser chance of success, but because [*every* company fails an FDA approval every now and then](http://www.fda.gov/ForPatients/Approvals/Drugs/ucm405622.htm). A small company can't afford that failure, though. There's nothing for that company to fall on.

**Mast Therapeutics ($MSTX)**

This was requested highly and apparently it's WSB's new biopharm crush. I never thought I would spend time reading up on one of my blacklisted diseases (Heart Disease), but here I am.

* Are you betting on Mast's Heart Failure trails? You're an idiot. If their clinical trial was in Phase 3 and showed positive interim data towards its latter half, then you wouldn't be an idiot. But *the start* of Phase 2? There is absolutely nothing a company can say that should convince you on a drug that has eluded much bigger companies countless times in the past. At least not until there are some major discoveries in the field. Historical data says this drug will probably fail. FDA approval statistics says this drug will probably fail. Clinical trial data so far says effectively nothing, except that people who are taking the drug haven't suffered adverse effects. 

* Vepoloxamer for Sickle Cell Disease. This isn't on my blacklist, but it probably should be. I personally think this is the only good thing Mast has going for it right now, and even then it's a very risky play. It's not a pure gamble, but definitely a high level YOLO.

* The first catalyst (we'll call this 'C1') is for sure coming up on or before July 31st. Mast has to deliver positive Phase 3 results by July 31st to one of their creditors, Hercules Capital, or they will have to entirely pay back $15M by that date. Additionally, on February 10th MSTX had a huge Public Offering of almost 30M warrants. These can be exercised around the second week of August (we'll call this catalyst 'C2') for $0.42 each in return for a single share. Here are the most likely things that could happen before, during, and after these dates. 

   * C1 results are negative and you're fucked. 

   * Shares go up in anticipation of C1 results (to $X), the results are positive, and the shares immediately drop to between $0.42 and $X. If the results are significant but end up disappointing for whatever reason, then they could even drop below $0.42, but this is unlikely.  

   * C1 results are positive, shares spike up (to $Y) for a variable number of days, and then drop back down to between $0.42 and $Y on or before C2. 

   * Results are positive, shares go up, and then go up again after C2. 

* C2 is a very important date that is going to end up shaping every decision you will, and should, make surrounding Mast. 30M new shares will suddenly enter the market, and the people who own them will have bought them for only $0.42 each. *Even if Phase 3 results are good, you could lose money.* People who know this might also short and potentially cause a panic sell-off. The only way bullet point #4 will ever happen is if C2 is already priced in after results are released, but this is hopeful thinking. 

* The safest YOLO-esque option is to sell a portion of your shares if Mast goes up in anticipation of C1, and then hold out to see the results. After the results come out, and if the price goes up again because of them, you should sell everything immediately. Do not wait to see what will happen. Yes, it could go up even more and you could lose out on some profit. But if you hold onto your shares at this point, it's not a YOLO anymore. It's a gamble.

**MannKind Corporation ($MNKD)**

A steaming pile of shit. This isn't a YOLO or even a gamble. It's just shit.

Their sole drug AFREZZA suffered the same fate as its predecessor: there's not enough demand for inhalable insulin to generate profit. Especially not when you have to sell the device (which needs to be replaced) needed to deliver the drug effectively, and also price the entire package so people don't choose injections instead. 

Medically, AFREZZA has nothing going for it over injectable insulin other than a faster action time. Sure, it's more convenient for people who are afraid of shots, but that's it. That's MannKind's entire consumer base. No one else will want to buy the drug over injections. Injections are cheaper, far more reliable, safer (constant dose every time), and have done the job effectively for so long that a company needs to innovate far beyond mere convenience to make a change.  

MannKind also wants to explore other drugs that could potentially use their inhalation device. They're not even in a Phase 1 trial. 

Let's recap now. They have a failed drug that will never make a dent in competition, and they have a device that they're looking to use but have nothing concrete to show for at least the next three years. 

They are not worth a $600M valuation.

**Array Biopharma Inc ($ARRY):** 

No. I will never invest in cancer until major breakthroughs are made in the field outside of pharmaceuticals. No matter how much you think you know about some drug, or how many clinical trials you read, you will *never* know how a treatment for cancer will turn out. Cancer is by far the biggest risk you could ever take in Pharma. It will continue to be the biggest risk for quite some time. 

The only thing I would even think about doing with Array is buying shares and selling slightly OTM covered calls. That way I could wait for some of their Phase 3 results and not lose out on too much money when/if the data is bad. There's much less upside in doing this, but you would be a fool to think Phase 3 cancer trials are safe bets.

**Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD):**

This was one of my first ever YOLOs, and I lost money on it twice. AMD has this thing where they seem really promising a few times every single fucking year, and then fail to deliver. Good news is that AMD will probably never completely fall apart. They own too many patents and carry a niche market. I think AMD will always have a chance to go up, but I wouldn't go ham on it. Buy a few options if you want to. Only YOLO a little bit of your portfolio. Look at it from afar, but don't fall in love. 

---
---

-

**Smith &amp; Wesson Holding Corp $SWHC:**

This isn't a YOLO. I think it's a great company with more than enough stability to gain a spot on your main portfolio. You might lose money on it in the short term (think months or even years), but long term this company isn't going anywhere. Buy it and forget about it. 

---
---

-

**NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA):** 

Unless AMD suddenly markets a breakthrough product line, NVIDIA will be fine. This is a YOLO because there's potential to lose money in the coming months, but in that case you could always hold through for the year and you would most likely be fine. Another buy it and forget about it. Not as stable as SWHC, but stable enough to not worry for at least half a year. 

---

-

**22nd Century Group Inc ($XXII):**

Maybe if vaping wasn't a thing. Seems like their products cost a lot of money to produce. The only way they're going to profit is if they either reduce the cost of production, or carve out a really solid niche as a premium cigarette brand. I personally think that this company would make quite a bit of money if they marketed somewhere like Central London or Dubai where you have rich people who also smoke a lot. Right now I wouldn't invest in the company until they make a few more advancements. Especially not when electronic cigarettes are becoming more popular than regular cigarettes for younger demographics. 

---
---

-

**Relypsa Inc ($RLYP):**

I was into RLYP when there was still uncertainty surrounding them. I made a lot of money off selling covered calls, and I know I made a few people in here a lot of money as well. I don't have confidence in the company's success anymore, though. They will likely profit, but not enough to sustain their currently huge market valuation (unless they start trials on new drugs). The next major catalyst for this company is the removal of Veltassa's black box warning. That will cause some hype if approved, but if anything I would use that hype only to exit out of the position. I'll keep an eye out on this one, but for the time being, RLYP isn't worth investing in and doesn't have that much potential. ",42

16-06-25,4pqb82,US Citizen living in NZ - Move investments to NZ?,"This is a little similar to other questions which specifically ask about investment options in New Zealand... 
I'm a U.S. citizen, living long term in New Zealand. Currently I have a U.S. Vanguard account which has a mixture of FTSE All World and Total U.S. Index Fund admiral shares (and a little bit of ETF). Then I also have an amount in the NZ savings which is pretty good (~4%). At first I used to send NZ funds to the US, but lately the exchange rate has kind of been poor, so I haven't sent funds in a while. 

My question is whether anyone can offer insight on the benefits of keeping my funds in the US and making contributions with the currency exchange, vs moving those funds over to NZ into something like SmartShares. NZ options seem to have a significantly higher operating cost (~.30 - .40 on SmartShares). But I would be able to easily make contributions in NZ currency.

Musk doesn't want to announce what the combination project is just in case is fails and I have a theory as to what it is. I am only going off speculation and not necessarily hard facts because of the secrecy. This company started good and went down hill. My question mainly is why? Does anyone even know what solar panels do? They produce electricity through the power of the sun. I don't know the details on to how but it does it. Tesla is a rising electric car company, because of this I firmly believe that tesla is working towards getting a solar powered electric car. This isn't infinite energy just yet but it is at the very least a start. It will certainly extend the battery life where you will not need to charge your tesla car as often. I just don't understand why other people don't see it this way. When solar panel technology gets more advanced hopefully we will eventually not need to recharge at all or very infrequently.

Brexit will send rounds of shockwaves through the markets for weeks to come. Next week there will be talks of Europe falling apart, -5%, the week after that, -5% again. There hasn't been this much uncertainty in the financial world since 2008.

# Description
Vodafone is a mobile communications company which provides services to mobile voice, messaging, data and fixed line. 

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Vodafone Group Plc (ADR) | $60,960M | 28% | n/a
BT Group plc (ADR) | $28,133M | 35% | 46%
Deutsche Telekom AG (ADR) | $79,713M | 25% | 20%
Orange SA (ADR) | $45,809M | 28% | 7%
Telefonica S.A. (ADR) | $52,896M | 24% | 0%
Telenor ASA (ADR) | $15,927M | 38% | 6%

Vodafone Group Plc (ADR) has $20,646M of net debt. That is 1.2x it's latest operating profit. So nothing troubling there.

The professionals on Wall Street have a $39.15 for Vodafone Group Plc (ADR) and their recommendation to clients is buy. That implies an upside of 21% to their target.

# Valuation

The following table shows the key valuation metrics

Companies|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|--------:|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------|
$VOD | $85,098M | 40x | 17% | 5% | 15%
$BT | $64,180M | 11x | 7% | 5% | 17%
$DTEGY (Pink sheet) | $78,314M | 19x | 21% | 4% | 29%
$ORAN | $44,746M | 15x | 3% | 4% | 24%
$TEF | $52,213M | 17x | 44% | 9% | 12%
$TELNY (Pink sheet) | $24,087M | 11x | 14% | 6% | 40%

# Dividends
Vodafone Group Plc (ADR) is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.71 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $1.70 per share. But given the dividend is substantially higher than earnings, there may be reason for concern.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 3% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 26%. So it's *growing* into it's valuation. All comes against a backdrop of declining revenues. For the fiscal year ended 31 March 2016, Vodafone Group Plc (ADR) revenues decreased 3% to L40.97B. 

If sentiment turns for Europe, the UK and Emerging Markets maybe $VOD can overcome the headwinds it's currently facing. Feels like it is ex-growth. And unless they can squeeze more cash out of the machine, it's hard to see that the catalysts are going to be.

16-06-25,4pqpek,Novavax $NVAX DD,"Due to a request by /u/701_PUMPER, I have put together this DD of a company I've been talking about since March.  Unlike most of the bio stocks talked about here, this is an example of a mid-cap, with market cap around $2b.  However, it is still pre-commercial, meaning that its first Phase 3 data release in Q3 of this year has potential to significantly move the price.  They specialize in developing vaccines for infectious diseases and have a proprietary synthetic nanoparticle platform that allows them to develop vaccines much more quickly than with traditional methods.

This is a well-respected company with heavy institutional support and the recipient of of high profile grants from BARDA (Office of Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  They have also been awarded millions from the State of Maryland to help expand their facilities and their workforce from 443 to 1300: http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-novavax-expands-20160608-story.html  Also rated one of the WaPo's top workplaces 2 years in a row.

Most recent corporate presentation: http://novavax.com/presentation.show

**Key Statistics**

Current Price: $6.66

Shares Outstanding: 270.8m

Market Cap: $1.80b

Cash Position: 433.87m

Total Debt: 315.52m (explanation below)

Institutional Ownership: 69.5%

Employees: 443 (plans to add another 850)

**Technical Notes**

Novavax enjoyed a dramatic run last year from $6 to $15 amidst positive phase 2 announcements, news of the Gates grant, and the Ebola crisis.  Unfortunately, like most pre-phase 3 companies, price action didn't hold, and it quickly corrected to the $7-8 range.  The stock further tanked amidst the biotech panic early this year, and this decline was compounded by a $300m offering that sent the price to the mid-$4s.  However, it must be said that unlike many bios that had dilutive common stock offerings in an attempt to shore up their cash positions amidst hostile market conditions in Jan/Feb, Novavax's offering came in the form of convertible notes maturing in 2023.  This means that matters of dilution are kicked down the road.

Currently, NVAX is enjoying another dramatic run that started in mid-May, as investors started loading in anticipation of P3 results.  It has been going more or less non-stop since touching down for the third time this year at the mid-$4 support zone.  This month it has been consolidating in the mid-$6s.  It is clear of both the 50-day SMA (5.68) and 200-day SMA (6.49).

**Technology and Pipeline**

Video describing the Matrix-M platform: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTMA2YPvUmk

Despite huge advances in medical technology in the 20th century, most of the vaccine industry is still using the tried-and-true traditional approach of cultivating viruses in chicken eggs to be weakened or killed for the eventual vaccine.  Not only is this time-consuming, but vaccines produced in the traditional way carry with them the risk of adverse infectious effects (particularly with attenuated viruses).  Novavax's Matrix-M is of a new class of synthetic nanoparticle vaccine platforms, whereby a virus's immunogenic epitopes are identified, synthetically produced, and attached to a virus-like nanoparticle.  Not only does this speed up the production of a vaccine, but it also has benefits of more efficient dosing and greater safety.

Novavax's current focus consists of 2 main product lines - its much touted RSV vaccine and its novel flu vaccines.

RSV is a respiratory illness that afflicts primarily babies and old people, with over 200,000 hospitalizations and 16,000 deaths per year in the United States.  Doctors have been trying to develop a vaccine for RSV since the 40s, and this is the first one that seems to work.  Novavax's RSV vaccine is currently in P3 tests in elderly and in infants (via maternal immunization).  These are two separate trials.  They also intend to initiate P2 trials in immunizing children aged 6mo-5yrs.

Novavax's quadrivalent influenza vaccine reported positive P2 results last year.  Nothing too exciting here other than that it's a bit more efficient and well-tolerated than current vaccines.  HOWEVER, the company is working on combining their RSV vaccine and this seasonal flu vaccine into a single shot, thereby covering these two respiratory ailments at once.  This has huge market potential.  They are also working, with the money granted to them by BARDA, on a pandemic flu vaccine.  This is a moving target based on the likelihood of pandemic threats - they started with H1N1, but now they've transitioned to focusing on H7N9.

On the matter of emerging threats, Novavax routinely does clinical-stage research on proof of concept vaccines for the latest disease panic.  Don't expect any of these programs to yield fruits until years down the line when Novavax can self-fund some of this development, but the fact that they are producing viable vaccines for the likes of ebola, Mers, and zika demonstrates the power and potential of their platform.  For example, Novavax's ebola vaccine has the advantage of being able to be stored at standard refrigeration temps (unlike most other candidates that require dry ice temps) and has the potential to be effective against multiple ebola strains.

**Near term catalysts/value drivers**

For 2016, there's only one thing you need to pay attention to - the phase 3 RSV results.  Phase 3 data for the elderly trial is due to report in Q3 of this year.  The patients were immunized in November-December of 2015, and right now it's just data compilation, as there are some 11850 patients to process.  If successful, and by all indications the market seems to strongly believe in this outcome, Novavax intends to have FDA approval in hand in 2017 ahead of the 2017/18 RSV season.  Fast track designation will help get them there.

RSV maternal is still in the process of recruiting, and data from that study will take years to mature, but the elderly market is the more essential market for the time being.  Given that there is a ready and willing population that already gets flu shots in huge numbers, the RSV vaccine has the potential to get rapid market penetration.  And this will only get better for Novavax once they start packaging RSV with their seasonal flu shot.",21

16-06-25,4pr71t,Please help me understand wash sale rule correctly,"This is in regards to US wash sale rule. 

The general principle of the wash sale rule makes sense, but what I don't fully understand the ""before"" part: 

&gt; trades a security at a loss, and within 30 days **before** or after this sale, buys a “substantially identical” stock

All online examples assume that one is buying -&gt; selling -&gt; buying. What if I'm just buying -&gt; selling -&gt; NOT buying back for 30 days.

The ""before"" part makes it sound like I'd still have to deal with the wash sale rule? 
Let's say I buy 100 shares of AAPL at $95 and a week later I decide to sell all 100 shares at $90. I made a loss of $500 but it would trigger the wash sale rule because I bought within the 30 days before the sale. But I never actually buy back into the stock, I want to accept the loss and move on. Can I write off the $500 even though I bought &amp; sold within 30 days? The key factor being that I never bought the stock back after selling it. 

Would it behave the same if I sold 50 shares and held on to the other half, as in, being able to deduct $250? ",1

16-06-25,4prblm,[Rant] I just took a 15k loss on Brexit,"I'm an idiot and I kind of hate myself, I make all of my money selling options and holding stock... Last week during the news panic over brexit, the GBP was at pretty low levels. I kept hearing in the news that the brexit would fail because remain was projected to win, I believed it myself as well, the idea of GB leaving the EU sounded ridiculous to me, that combined with the pro-remain MP being assassinated, and the literal 'firing of a shotgun on your own foot' it would do to everyone's economy, not just GB, I thought the fears were overblown so I broke my system and I did an impulse trade that I swore myself to stop doing because they always cost me, I didn't have a clear exit or entry point, I just went in and the night of the election, I had about +8k sitting in my account, feeling pretty good about it I decided to hold anticipating that the 8 would be 10-11k after the results were official and I would exit my position after that.

I took a nap, and woke up to find my account was suddenly -2k, I was really surprised so I looked at the news channel and my heart sank like a rock, I saw that 'leave' was in the lead by 6%, but then I saw only 1% of the vote was reporting in, so I let off a sigh.

Later on that night, remain took a very brief lead, and I was back positive again by ~1k, and here I should have just exited, I am hating myself for this, because I realized at that point, I don't fucking know much anything about British politics, brexit, or anything about the EU besides what's been on the news, so fuck me, I should get out, but I was too blinded by this point, I wanted to get back to my previous level, I was too emotional getting sucked into an event happening in real time, which is also why I don't allow myself to trade during big market moves because I always make HORRIBLE trades when I am fearful, I second guess everything and try to envision the opposite leg of the trade, do convoluted shit like recognize it is a stressful situation and I make bad choices, so I should short my leg instead, then if it starts going down, I tell myself to exit like normal, but then I convince myself to stay, or exit, then buy back in, it's just a fucking trainwreck that would be hilariously pathetic to watch if it were on a TV show, except this is real life and it's just sad and infuriating to see yourself destroying your life and everything you've worked hard and patiently to build. 

Sorry for the tangent, but to get back to the story, I finally panic sold, I took off a portion while it was still in the 1.4x, and again after it broke below, and finally closed my last position damn near the bottom when USD/GBP was at 1.335. Under normal conditions, if I was thinking clearly I never would have done that trade, I just smash through buttons so fast without thinking about what I'm doing when my mind is watching a red candle falling further and further, lower than my predicted low (And this is another reason why I do better when I trade things I research, because I have price points I don't FUCKING PULL OUT OF MY ASS), so I started getting these wild PTSD visions of the time I first started trading options and lost my entire account trying to buy OTM contracts, so I said 'fuck this! not again!! not like this!!!' and I burned through the fucking screen and before I knew it, I wanted to just punch myself.

The thing about these kind of events, they're always overblown, people love to panic, they panic when the news is wrong about something, when everyone in the news is reporting something is probably or probably not going to happen, the entire market prices it in like the news is right, but when the news is wrong, shit just hits the fan and people panic, like it's the end of the world and begin panic selling or buying... I knew a major currency changing it's value by 15% in a day was insane, yet I didn't take the time to think about the implications and instead I just focused on the NOW on fearing that the GBP would be worth almost the same, if not the same as my filthy american moneys.

then I saw it climb back up slowly to 1.4x and now it's sitting at 1.38x last time I saw it. 

My total loss from this trade was ~15k, my account was worth a total of 55k the night before, so it was 40k by the time I was done trading that night, then the next morning my stock positions all collectively tanked so it's currently at 30k.

I decided this is the final straw for me, I'm not ever going to allow myself to try to trade on a volatile event ever again, the excitement always gets to me, the desire to make money off an event like sports betting, but this is some different shit, I wouldn't even bet $1000 on my favorite boxer to win a fight, why the fuck would I bet so much on some referendum that was reportedly very close to 50/50 that I barely know anything about? BECAUSE I'M A RETARD. 

Fuck. Let this be a lesson to all of you, don't be fucking retarded, manage your risk. I put up WAYYY too much money on that leg, the fact that I just nuked more than a 4th of my account really tilts me, it will take me a couple of months trading options to recover all of that, I broke my system and I want to punch myself in the face for it, this is what happens when I get too bored...

Anyway, yesterday I was pretty annoyed, this morning I was a little depressed because I didn't leave the apartment except to buy food once, but at this point, I've forgiven myself for the mistake. I'm going to try my best to avoid ever repeating such a stupid error and continue back to doing what I was doing before, research nice trades which I manage and calculate better risk/odds and never do this Las Vegas type horse racing shit ever again.

However, if you think there is a chance at rebound consider waiting for it to climb a little after Brexit.  Some stocks just fell from the referendum and others were falling either way.


**Edit 2:**  Ok since people are getting a little pissy about it.  Technically yes, your equity value decreases when a stock goes down.  You don't realize the lose until it is sold though.  This was really only a reminder to those with solid investments playing a longer game.  Stay calm and understand that good companies with growth and foundation will rebound, do not 1929 this and panic.",88

16-06-25,4puqu9,"Ladies and gentlemens, it's officially time to panic (DD)","This Friday, shortly after opening, I liquidated all my positions, taking a sizeable loss. Why? Because it's fairly obvious the market is going to keep going down.

Monday at bell opening, I am going to massively short the S&amp;P500  by short selling the SPY, which I think is less risky than buying puts / definitely less than selling calls. There is no way in hell the market won't keep going down over the summer.

Here's why:

1) We are just barely 37 points over the 2,000 mark. Do you honestly believe we won't cross that mark? We are just 1.85% over it; at this point, it's basically guaranteed we'll break the 2,000 mark. And then what? You think it will bounce back above 2,000 immediately? Lol.

2) This is the summer season. Big traders are away. People aren't saving as much and aren't investing a lot (this happens in September/January, a long time from now). If anything, people will cover their losses ""before they lose more."" This will last AT LEAST until the end of summer.

3) We just had the biggest one day crash in what, a year? There are consequences to that.

4) Brexit is just starting. Soon it will be France, Portugal, Italy, every country leaving the EU. This will seriously mess up the world economy for years to come. Simply said, europe is fucked. This will fuck up everything from banks around the world to manufacturers in the US (selling in EU) for years.

5) I fully expect another crash in September/October once people come back from vacations

6) Sell in may they say?

For these reasons, I fail to see how the market could go up. Do you think people will wake up on monday and think, ""well, last week was last week, guess it's time to forget the 4%+ crash and just buy."" Obviously not. Nobody wants to buy at the start of a crash. People are not going to wake up monday and think, ""well, now that we had the biggest crash in a while and with tons of uncertainties, I'm going to go buy... still in the second month of summer LOL!""

**I believe we will not see the S&amp;P500 above 2,100 for a very long time - at the very least until the end of this decade.**

This is just the beginning of the crash. Don't believe all the people telling you ""this isn't a lehman moment"" and all that crap. They said the same thing when Lehman Brother failed: ""It ain't so bad blah blah blah don't sell blah blah blah just hold."" These fuckers just want you to keep holding your stocks while they LIQUIDATE. That's what the big players are doing right now: slowly selling all their positions, knowing they can buy them back at a 10%+ discount.

**There is no way in hell - NO WAY IN HELL WHATSOEVER - that the S&amp;P500 doesn't break below the 1,800 mark.**

Look at the graph of the S&amp;P500; see something odds? Of course, there's a big gap down. And what happens afterwards? It keeps gapping down!

Look at the february low, where we barely stood above the 1,800 mark. You really think we aren't going to break that? Name me ONE thing that has improved since then, ONE thing that changed or improved. You know the answer? None. Not a single thing is going better since the February low.  And somehow we bounced anyway?

Now, we have a REAL, CONCRETE horrible news for the economy (brexit). There is no way we aren't crashing through the February low, period.

My own prediction is that we will have a day close at 1,850 or so, followed by a MASSIVE crash day where the S&amp;P will touch 1,790 or so, followed by a quick bounce. What happens after the bounce I do not know, but I plan to short the market and cover when the S&amp;P 500 hits 1,795 just to be safe.

In summary, I fail to see ONE single catalyst to push the market higher. And with fear still rampant, summer underway and Brexit being mere days ago, the market is going down, period. Go ahead and short everything.

With brexit happening it took a 30% dip. So I'm thinking it might actually recover it's value in the future and it might be worthwhile to invest some more money in it for when it does. 

Since people posting think I'm just an idiot. I'll explain.. First off I didn't purchase this stock some stupid financial advisors did. I just wasn't sure what to buy as a replacement stock so I haven't sold it yet. I also wasn't sure of the affects of brexit would have on it either. I already explained this too many times elsewhere.

Second.. Brexit might not have such a large adverse effect as people are expecting on British banks. Conversely it might actually have a positive effect. Since the UK is no longer required to support the poor of the entire EU. I'm not expecting it to raise to new highs but pre bexit levels seems likely at least right? That's what I wanted to know


Now I was asking in hopes for some serious discussion. On the pros and cons of having such a stock. I know nothing about it nor do I even know how to research into british banking stocks. Fidelity doesn't offer in depth research into foreign stocks.

Among advanced economies, the next highest debt level is Greece (197 percent), followed by Portugal (128 percent). This very high debt level means that a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates on government debt would cause the share of taxes required to pay interest on the debt to rise by an amount equal to 2.5 percent of GDP. 

&gt; Fortunately, the situation is not so dire since the government earns income from its asset holdings, making net debt a more appropriate measure of the tax burden. The Japanese government owns equity shares, has deposits in banks, and holds the country’s foreign exchange reserves ($1.2 trillion as of April 2016). This last entry is somewhat unique, as most advanced economies put their foreign exchange reserves on the central bank’s balance sheet. In addition, a substantial amount of government debt is held by other parts of the government. Together, these assets produce a net debt of 126 percent of GDP.

I'm not talking about that giant petition, that thing is nonsense.  There's a ton of stuff out there you can read up on but main points that have got me focused on this:

1.  Brexit can't happen until the UK triggers EU Article 50.  That starts the 2-year exit clock.  Cameron said he won't do it and he said he's staying until October.  So at a minimum you've got 2.5 years before this actually goes down during which both the citizens and powers that be in the UK can watch the toll this possibility takes on their country

2.  You've got the issue of a UK breakup.  Today Scotland's First Minister said she'd try to prevent Brexit via the power Scotland's Parliament has.  

There's a whole other litany of things that call into question if this will ever actually get done or if the regret of the reality of the situation will prevent it.  

I don't trade currency or British banks so looking for group discussion on what we could play here.  It has to be something long-dated because who know when this might pay off, at least a year probably.  

Has to also somehow be something that would actually pay off and not remain shitty because of the instability a reversion from Brexit would also cause

I agree, it's always best to get back on the market quickly:

... 


&gt;“Great Britain needs to say which kind of relationship it imagines having with the EU,” Merkel told reporters in Potsdam, outside Berlin. Those talks should be “matter-of-fact” and “shouldn’t drag on forever,” she said.
Others were less polite.

&gt;“We demand that the 27 other member countries also get respect” from the U.K., French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said

16-06-26,4pzwgg,Limit order question,"If this is a stupid question, sorry in advance. I'm a complete novice at investing but recently opened an account with 25k so I have this question. Let's say on any given day you want to put in 10 limit orders, and you really want to use 100% of your account on these orders. But I assume you have to put  about 10% of your account into each order to divide it up evenly to accomplish this. But only 5 of your orders ever process and by the end of the day the other 5 orders are cancelled. So I guess you end up only using 50% of your account between those orders. Which kind of stinks if you want to invest with 100% of your account all the time.


I'd like to do something like this:

Place 10 orders at 9:35

Order 1 processed 9:45am: 100% 

Order 2 processed 9:50am: 50%, 50%

Order 1 hits stop loss 9:55am: Now have 100% on order 2

Order 3 processed 10:00am: 50% 50%

Order 4 processed 11:00am: 33.3%, 33.3%, 33.3%

Order 5 processed 12:00pm: 25%, 25%, 25%, 25%

Others get cancelled at EOD

(I read the [Why we recommend Vanguard](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1owcra/moron_monday_ask_that_question_you_always_thought/ccwd45j) in the FAQ.)

I will be 44 in September and my income will drop to basically zero as I will quit my job and move. I have $10K in cash sitting in a Fidelity account that I want to put to work. I also have cash in a savings account that could allow me to not work for 6 months (very low rent/I'm single, no kids). No debts, working car, excellent credit score (~820).

I do expect to find a new job within 6 months but don't expect it to be high paying. I've given up on that... (A bachelor's degree in Biology hasn't exactly paid off for me). And I do expect to be working until I'm 65 at least :(

One thing I have recently learned is the practically unanimous advice of picking a Vanguard fund. I like my choices to be simple! As I learn more and get the ball rolling, I can/will move more money from savings to another fund, most likely. The days of buying cd's are long gone.

With the markets taking a breather, I think this is a good time to dip back in.

So I'm sure some of you remember the FLIP HD cameras and how big they were when they came out.  They were simple cameras, used by almost everybody in the online video making community.  Almost the same to how go pro is now.  Alot of people use them for vlogs and what not.  Well cisco bought out FLIP camera's but they ultimately all went to shit and no one used them anymore all due to one thing...smart phones.  I'm betting the same happens with go pro as well.  Smart phones will evolve even more and will soon allow you to use them for the same purpose that a go pro is used (POV filming).  Which i guess you could use them for that now, but i bet sooner or later companies will start producing products for these smart phones to allow them to be used for the same purpose that a go pro is used.

16-06-26,4pwc8c,DD on MSTX. Hype or not?,"There has been a lot of hype surrounding MSTX. Here is my quick DD on MSTX and Vepolaxamer, A perspective from a heavy background in science although just a newbie in finance ( I just started investing about a week ago). I don’t know how many people actually understand the drug and the trials or are most people just buying in on the hype.

MST-188 is a drug that hopes to reduce pain during a sickle crisis. 
Physiologically, the sickled red blood cells are sickled shape, causing it to carry reduced oxygen and the sickle shape makes it harder to travel though blood vessels, it will eventually collide against the walls of a blood vessel and stay put. The damaged RBCS will have sticky open sores that cause them to stick to one another accumulating a blood dam and thus preventing tissues from receiving adequate oxygen. This inadequate lack of oxygen tissue is what causes the pain. The current therapy focuses on eliminating symptoms by inducing more fluids.

In the simplest form,Vepolaxamer or MST-188 is targeting the source of pain by its action of mechanism which is attaching directly on to a cell membrane with it’s sticky side, and having the surfactant surface on the other end to avoid RBCS from sticking to one another, increasing blood flow and productively reducing pain. The drug eventually leaves the membrane once the RBC repairs itself, exiting the body by the kidneys.

Complete video here : http://theepicstudy.com/videos/
If you are interested in seeing the animation of the drug inside the body.

FDA conditional success rates for drugs in Phase III of clinical trials is about 64%. According to this site: http://www.fdareview.org/03_drug_development.php.

MSTX revenues, operating costs, and stability depends heavily on the success of this drug. 
The drug effect might show minor results, a symptom reducing drug but not anywhere close to a breakthrough. It will not replace hydroxyurea, the hail mary of sickle cell drugs for the last 25 years. I could however see Vepolaxamer working in conjunction with hydroxyurea ( if it passes phase III) to stop the production of the sickle cells and to alleviate the pain of ones that are sickled through lubrication.

At a quick glance the trend seems to show support around $0.40 and a resistance at $0.45. It most likely wont break the resistance point until after the release of a successful trial. Until then we’re all just going to be clenching our assholes waiting for news.

Conclusion: Buy YOLO shares, as the data points towards success. I would not long this stock. My guess is this drug is just meant to bring in quick revenue for the company if it succeeds but not for long term growth. 

I’m positive there is a lot of people here who have a ton of biotech experience and science backgrounds. Please do get in on the conversation and correct me if I am wrong.",27
16-06-26,4pwgm9,My attempt at NKE ER DD.,"Alright, I'm new to this whole DD thing, but I'm going to take a stab at this: I think NKE might beat their ER estimate, and might even have a nice gap up as a result.


Nikes posting their earnings Tuesday PM for Q4 2016. Taking a look at last year we see:


EPS forecast: $.42
Actual EPS: $.49


I'm not as concerned with the fact that Nike beat last year, I'm more interested in their EPS, $.49. If we look at the EPS forecast for this year [it's $.48, lower than last year](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/nke), meaning they're expected to have worse results than last year.


However, when looking at the (Q3 financial statement from this fiscal year)[http://s1.q4cdn.com/806093406/files/doc_financials/2016/Q3/NIKE-Inc-Q316-Press-Release-03-22-16-FINAL.pdf]:


&gt; Futures Orders
&gt; As of the end of the quarter, worldwide futures orders for NIKE Brand athletic footwear and apparel
scheduled for delivery from March 2016 through July 2016 were 12 percent higher than orders
reported for the same period last year. Excluding currency changes, futures orders would have
increased 17 percent.*


So Nike is expected to report worse earnings than last year, despite the fact that they saw a double digit increase in orders expected to deliver in Q4. Granted, I don't know if these orders were paid for, and counted, in the Q3 earnings but that still seems like a good sign to me.


Looking towards the future, I'm guessing Nike will have a positive outlook. I think European sales could see an bump due to the Euros, and possibly NA sales from [Lebron and the Cavs becoming the first team to come back from a 3-1 deficit in the Finals](http://www.si.com/nba/photos/2015/05/18/nba-playoff-3-1-comebacks), which seems important. Or not. Who the hell knows.


Anyway, last thing. With Brexit, I think any stock showing signs of stability/promise are going to be priced at a higher premium than normal. If Nike can beat their earnings estimate, and not show shitty guidance, I think there will be a bigger bump than if Britain Bremained.


Well there it is, I gave it a shot. GFYs.",14
16-06-25,4pt8rx,Who is hurting by Brexit? Let it out here.,"I didn't take the Brexit news seriously and didn't think I'd be affected by it. Honestly, I didn't give a fuck.


Going into the vote, I only had one position:  Apple calendar spreads at strike price 97 (half calls, half puts). The short options were Friday expiry. Just my luck, Apple closed under 94 and I'm out 1500 bucks. I should have closed the puts for break even when I had the chance earlier in the morning but it seemed that Apple was going to close in the green because so many people were buying. Now, I am left with  long July 22 97 calls. Apple earnings are July 15 so I hope to sell them right before earnings. I hope the inflated IV will help me to break even in three weeks.



I was all cash besides that one position. When I got home on Thursday night, some guy on here said that he went bankrupt on Brexit. Thanks to his post, I logged into my trading platform and saw the carnage. I was a few hours late, but I was able to trade crude oil futures and come out with a 1,000 dollar profit in a couple of hours. 



Then when crude oil futures lost steam, I went to trade S&amp;P futures. I shorted 2013.50 at the European open. I thought they would sell off but instead I got squeezed hard. I left my position open and went to bed hoping to wake up in the morning to a lower market. However, at the opening bell it was 2030 and in the early hours it was over 2060. I was negative 2500 on this trade. I almost decided to exit the position in the 2060's, but I told myself that I wasn't going to let them shake me out like they have done in the past (fuck them!). So I held throughout the day on Friday and the futures closed at 2018. So now, I'm only down 250 bucks. I'll probably exit the position on Sunday evening.




In short, I was late to the party but still managed to make 1k trading crude oil futures on Thursday night. I shorted S&amp;P futures near the lows. There was a huge short squeeze and I was down over 2k in that single trade. Friday closed near the lows and now I am only down 250 in that trade. My only other position was a calendar spread on Apple that I entered a week ago. I lost 1500 on that trade. Net:  500 loss.

On Thursday and Friday, I purchased in the money puts right when both the underlyings were at their lowest like a dummy (SPY @ 4.35 &amp; TSLA @ 8.25). I somehow was making a profit on both positions even though I over paid, and since the options had a week till expiry I thought I could milk out more gains. My spy put expires Jul 16 and my TSLA put is expiring Jul 1. 

So I log onto options house and see that the bid/ask for both of my positions are 80% less than what they were going for before close. Is this the theta decay that occurs on Fridays to account for the weekend? If so, wtf options lose that much in two days? Is it because the option is now a weekly and shit goes down where the option is revalued or something? If this is the case I shouldn't I always sell before the end of the second to last week? Or maybe this is that IV crush everyone talks about on here, and the BREXIT was the IV crushing event causing my shit to be bunk? 

What I'm convincing myself right now is that the bid and ask just plummet on weekends/after hours but go back to normal once market opens. Regardless of w/e happened I'm a dumbass for not flipping both these options on Friday and moving on.

&gt; Does the fund do something unique that realistically cannot be replicated in a cheaper and more transparent vehicle, such as an ETF, mutual fund or managed account?

I know of zero funds that are long Precious, the Riyal, perfectly rational priced FFFs, and WMT. But there IS always $DUST.......

[Oh and a healthy allocation of the non-gentile elderly's store of enamel]

&gt; Does the fund deal in illiquid securities that would justify the lack of liquidity of the fund itself?

Sometimes. [Gotta know when to hold 'n when to fold'em on the liquids]

&gt; Does the fund have a strategy that would be fundamentally undermined by investor redemptions?

Yes. There will be long lockups, narrow redemptions, and various magnitudes of ""gates."" You will not see your money for a very long time.

16-06-26,4px681,Barclays DD,"First off, there is probably more room to head down but come on - it's Barclay's.  

These dudes were founded in 1690.  Ya, that's right, like three hundred and twenty five years ago.  Why is this important?  Well, as their CEO said, a LOT of crazy shit has happened during that time that they have weathered.  Brexit? Gfy....it's just a minor wrinkle.  

Fucking three hundred+ years of major, earth shattering events - some of which resulted in millions dying - and you think now, this one referendum is going to bring about a fiscal apocalypse?  Let's look at (some) what they have already been through: 

Pachelbels Canon in D:  This was written about the same time they were formed.  Have you ever seen the bass part?  It's literally 8 notes....the whole song.  THE WHOLE FUCKING SONG.  This is really an excuse to tell Pachelbel to gfy for that.  Gfy.

American Revolution- the original brexit.  Barclays was pretty young and survived helping to finance a losing effort where we beat the shit out of those red coats; the Patriot is a solid movie.

Napoleon- This fucking short little guy attempted to take over the world, declared himself as emperor, and you probably know the rest.  Just Google it.  Britain survived.  And if you think you've made some bad trades....this dumbass sold us like half of our country (Louisiana Purchase) for the equivalent of 18 beanie babies during their peak picking.  

Irish Potato Famine: OMG THE WORLD IS ENDING.  Nah, barclays and the UK survived.  

WW1/WW2-  How many bombs dropped on England does it take?  Apparently more than the 30,000 dropped on them over 3 months in ww2.  Or killing like 700,000 during ww1...  something about ""brexit"" doesn't feel as catastrophic as the world powers gasing and nuking each other.

You get the idea....add in the Crimean War, the birth of Fscomeau, there 3747382837 other market ""crashes"" (some hyperbole), and all the other shitty things that we as humans have been through.  

It might go down more - but they are not going anywhere.  It's a buying opportunity for what people have called ""The Illuminatis Bank"".  Even Alex Jones is probably picking up shares of this.  THE FUCKING ILLUMINATI.

I am very excited to share with you http://www.retnio.com

For anyone interested in investing, this is a new and very convenient way to find new stocks or get insights about stocks that you already own. There's no investment advice on this site - it is just a new way for you to browse and get ideas (or rethink ideas).

For example, you can see what the main themes any company is talking about by going to that company's page: http://www.retnio.com/MSFT

You can see the universe of stocks for ANY industry that you can think of, and why those stocks are included: http://www.retnio.com/nuclear%20energy

And for each theme and each company, you can see exactly where and how often that theme is discussed in the public filings.

Would love to hear your feedback!

* How old are you?

* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)
* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)
* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)

* Any big debts?

""Dumb Dumber and don't have a fucking clue but will use big words to try and impress anyway""


Game of Morons

[Teaser Trailer](https://media.giphy.com/media/DkuLdtOLhkW6k/giphy.gif)


Episodes of this show will be a whopping 24 x 5 starting Monday with the Tokyo open and last through the Trading week ending Friday with the New York close with brief and debriefs by the surrounding equally clueless and entirely lost battery of Analysts and commentators at the mercy of whatever bullshit is spewed out on the teleprompter. However if the daily show was looking for an opportunity to establish itself . . .its here.

The cast will be made up from all our favorite characters whom we all know. The Epic battle between ole' Iron Britches and Pe Pe le Pew will of course continue and get shriller and more nonsensical. 

Mary Poppins in the legacy of Elmer Fudd and Greengas will continue to make a cacophony of grunt, whooshes, burps farts and whistles which are supposed to mean something to the enlightened but is most probably old age and gas and the discomfort of try to cut one off in front of a million cameras without a sound. 

Across the pond we will have Petulant Posey trying keep the barrage in check with a strategically placed finger in the English Arsehole bursting damn, all the while waiting desperately to sneak off and shag a pig. And the of course our new freed slaves in the British isles with one question on every new free slave's mind when he finds himself well . . surprisingly freed . . .""Huh? . . .what the fuck do I do now?""

The bear Laughs in glee and the Chinese think to them selves "" sirry fukling blitish . .way to fuck yo serves . .mo oppotunity fo us""

India cringes "" (shaking head) Bloody hell . .no wonder the Americans were getting so cosy . .we are the fuck of last resort in todays economy""


In the first episode  . . no spoilers ahead . .its what we always knew but were afraid to admit, we come to the stark realization that Ned stark is dead . .just kidding . . .we come to the stark realization that our lives and world and our futures are in the hands of complete buffoons who know fucking next to nothing about the things they like to talk about most. They have a word list, with words like inflation, monetary policy, Treasury bills, geostrategic,national security, cpi,ppi, turmoil, economy, expected, interest rates . .etc etc and then they string them together in any random order so they sound like a sentence and they blast you in the face with it in the hope that you for a second believe that they know what they are doing.

This is what has been happening since 2007 . . .QE . .QE1 . .QE2 . . .QE3 . . .and oh wait . . .wait for it  QE4 . . .yes taking on debt will of course reduce debt

Every pregnant women knows that more fucking always reduces the pregnancy.

So dear friends, Romans, country men, people of the earth, martians, microbes on asteroids which will someday be sentient beings, flat eartherers may you always see straight and true, let the show begin . . .please keep a safe distance from your TV so the bullshit does not over flow and spew over your feet . . .

The object of the contestants is to keep talking as much as they can and to try and sound like they know what is happening and as if they are somehow in control and know something which we dont. They of course dont know you are reading this spoiler. Thats part of the game you see.

We shall watch them pose prance and spew all sorts of nonsense . . .the winner will be the one to fluke it or whose random meandering will be closest to the outcome.

Unfortunately the loser of course will be the people who of course have to foot the bill for whatever solution these leaders come out with, you see they are all broke of course . .out of cash . .moneyless . . . and the only place they can get it

16-06-27,4q26y0,"All of you are wrong about the market tomorrow, and here's why...","I've been in this game for quite a while, my dad works for NASDAQ so investing runs in my blood. 

Alright faggots - If you take a look at the charts from Friday, you'll see the Arbitrage limits are exponential, causing a simultaneous basis point for best-effort underwritings. What you don't see however is the European-style escrowed securities equity volume and exchangeable securities offering prospects on the ETF by the Ex-Dates are expiring due to registered traders rallying for reverse takeover and back door listing rights. So all those people who have the guaranteed investment securities are going to have to index their liquidating order for long term multi-jurisdictional disclosure system calls. But Jaden, what about the professional and equivalent real time data subscriptions on private placement financing principal trades? Well I'm glad you asked, because what you don't know is the north american industry classification system issued an OTC foreign trading per value partial fill limit on all private placement reverse take over listings. So therein, by underwriting the TSX venture exchange and doubling down on all S&amp;P/TSX Composite capped indexes for secondary financial offerings, you've met the Delta cap for all SEDAR requirements.

After all that - It's safe to say, that without a doubt I know with 100% certainty the market will either go up, or go down today. ",200

Qty bid ask
Min. qty bid ask
Maturity Coupon (with a date and a number)
Price bid ask
Yield to worst bid ask
Yield to maturity bid ask

Second, does this mean if I randomly choose one of these corporate bonds, in a year's time, I'll get 1.98% interest back plus principle?

16-06-27,4q2xsw,What to do with stock certificates,"Discovered that my dad  owns a ton of old stock certificates dating back from 2001. Companies like CP,  CNR....  Even companies that are no longer listed (fairmont hotel).  He no longer invests thank God (lost majority of his retirement money in the Nortel crash) but the other day I was watching TV and Brexit was all over the news and he casually mentioned that he gets dividend checks and what not.  Odd so I ask him if he owns any more stocks.  Said no and then brings in these
 certificates dating back to 2001. He has it stored in a box but there must be a better way to store/transfer these securities.

16-06-27,4q3b4e,Some reasons to consider shorting the yen (again),"hi wsb. here with sikk DD.

In short, as brexit continues to provide excellent dip after dip to buy, I'd like to point out another opportunity that might be safer than catching falling knives.

The pound and euro weaken, making people flee to safe havens such as the dollar, gold and the yen. The US is fine and dandy with a strong dollar, gold is inanimate, however the Yen is slightly different I think.

A strong yen is considered bad for Japan's economy, as I'm sure you all know, and the Japanese government, abe, and the BOJ really don't want it floating around the levels it is. They'd love to see 110 yen / dollar, or even more. 

[many analysts agree](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/26/japan-pm-abe-says-he-has-told-finmin-taro-aso-to-take-steps-to-calm-yen-if-needed.html) that the BOJ wants to take steps to weaken it's currency. Now I know a lot of you don't trade the big scary forex, so here's some plays.

Two good etfs I've enjoyed trading are YCS and YCL, short and long yen respectively.

You could also try longing EWJ, as the nikkei responds well to weaker yens.

Pepperonilly, I feel that having a government actively involved in weakening it's own currency is a strong ally, and without getting into the specifics of QE, or helicopter money and their (in)effectiveness, these stocks should pop on any news or action from the BOJ.

thats all.",3

16-06-26,4pznku,Great Instability Ahead,"I am writing this as a warning. Most investors on here are relatively young and have only lived through a bull market, never having experienced the full force of a bear market. What is ahead of us may not just a short term downturn like 2000 or 2008 but something greater, this is potentially the reset of the super debt cycle and perhaps even war as well. 

Most people here have applied a successful philosophy of mean reversion or ""buy the dip"", this type of strategy while works in the context of a overall bull market is very dangerous once the fundamentals have changed. I will try to cover briefly why it has changed and why we are in a very dangerous period.

Since the global financial crisis in 2008-2009, we have been basically in 6-7 years of soft currency wars, the fed was first to engage in a massive rate cut and QE cycle that pushed the dollar to historical lows, this proved good for corporate earnings and created a bubble in emerging markets. In 2012 EU got into the game with LTRO and Japan in 2013-2014. These created major currency volatility that swing upwards of 20-40%. Why were they doing this? What is the context?

The context is that the developed world has been off its growth trajectory and real wages haven't increased in close to 30 years. Both consumers and governments have tried to artificially boost improvements by taking on debt, but that incremental debt to growth is getting smaller and smaller, and is now having no impact. Governments and central banks know this and are each trying to devalue their own currency to devalue their debts and export deflation to someone else. But now as every currency is trying to devalue, there is no net real effect anymore.

There is now real populist mood brewing in all of the developed world, people who didn't benefit significantly from globalization are actively looking for scapegoats, which immigrants and foreigners fit. We are seeing the rise of ultra right parties in Northern Europe, ultra left parties in Southern Europe and Trump in the US. All of these parties appeal to a anti-globalization demographic that has long been ignored by the elites. The coming 1-2 year will host a number of election cycles in Western Europe and the us, which will have both extreme lefts or rights gaining large legislative blocks. What both extremes have in common is a anti-free trade and anti immigration bent. What has previously been sentiment now have a good chance of becoming legislation in the coming years. The pro-globalization consensus that came about since the end of WW2 is being challenged.

I think it is very likely that the trend is more trade barriers being put up, borders are getting redrawn in the EU, and a resurgence in nationalism. Last time this happened was in the 1930s, the Market crash of 1929 was followed by a depegging from gold (""currency war"") which was followed by the rise of extremist parties, nationalism and rising trade barriers in the late 30s and finally war. While I think the war cycle is much less likely in the context of nuclear weapons, I do think that major trade wars may be coming soon. It is not hard to imagine a China that needs to devalue by 30% to stem its fx reserve burn rate being challenged by a president trump with unilateral duties, sparking a global crisis of confidence. 

In short, the world is becoming a lot more unstable and uncertain. One should be a lot more prudent about ones management of capital. Can you live off of your savings if markets tank 50%, don't recover and you can't find a job for 2 years? These are real questions you should be thinking about that are in the realms of real possibilities when you are planning your portfolio allocation.",20

What is driving this move, and what fundamentals are effected by this?

Also it seems the central bankers don't even know what to do. Yellen just pulled out of the ECB conference.

On July 1St when I get paid I will set aside $150.

Now what I want to see happen, is have the reddit community (you) vote and tell me exactly what to do with that money. The end goal is to bring back more money each time a community vote is held, and when we all agree enough money had been made over the course of time and people watching, everything that has been made will be donated to a charity which receives the most number of votes from reddit.

This could go on as long as the thread stays relevant and keeps the user community's attention. So there is no limit or course of time we can do this in.

To begin I would like you the user to come up with an idea and specific details of what I should do with my money, and whichever idea gets the most upvotes is what will happen with the money.

Periodic updates on the amount of money in the bank account will be shown on here from screenshots so everyone knows where we stand with each transaction.

So to you the reddit community, tell me how to spend my money! So we can change some lives for the better in the not to distant future!",0

I've also been looking at investing in property in the UK, as rent is high in comparison to house prices, again i can find many american books, but still lack the information to make the investment.

I find investing in houses easier to understand than investing in stocks, the book recommends that you are to own a company before you start stock investing and that there's two types of investors (Enterprising + Defensive), the former requires a lot more research but makes a lot more money, they view it as a job rather than something they do in their spare time. And like I said, I won't be able to evaluate stock because without running a company before, I won't know what makes a good business.

I am struggling to find in depth education about investing in general, would like to understand stocks more in depth, but would say that housing market is better for me as It's easier to grasp.",6

16-06-27,4q3xlz,Market Analysis: The Cost of a (Gay) Human Life.,"Gentlemen, as we are well aware - the stock prices of both Ruger and Smith &amp; Wesson increased after the tragic shooting in Orlando, where 50 gays lost their lives.  

Now, the question is - did the increase in stock price reflect the mere value of their lives or did it reflect increased expectations for sales for the corporations?  The day after, both companies sold off to their previous levels, and from this we can see, given that the efficient market hypothesis tells us that speculative excess is impossible and since broader market conditions had not changed, that there was in fact an appropriate pricing for both RGR and SWHC that day after the shooting.   But with what were they appropriately priced in mind?

I put forward that the souls of the gays were in a transitory state and held in a pur-gay-tory of sorts inside the market cap of RGR and SWHC themselves and it is the value of their lives inside the increased market caps and the subsequently, after spending their time in the market cap, they went to their appropriate afterlife.

Based on this, we can estimate the life of a gay person based on the change in market cap for both companies.

SWHC closed at 21.41 previously and opened at 22.98, the opening price reflecting the increase due to the shooting.  Similarly, Ruger closed at 58.01 and closed at 60.46.  SWHC has 56 million shares and RGR has 19 million shares.   Using these to determine the market caps on the day before and day after we arrive at a difference of 134.47 million dollars.

Dividing that by the number of killed - 50 (including the probably gay shooter himself) we discover that a gay life is worth $2.69 million dollars.

That seems impressively high.  Perhaps it is the rarity of the homosexual that makes them so valuable.  ",46

16-06-28,4q6rtl,"My plans for the next two weeks... Collect T's dividend, gamble on European banks + AMD, start a position in GILD.","Going into Brexit, I was sitting on two long equity positions, with 95% of the rest of my assets in cash:

1. 145 shares of HRL ($5,000 cost)
2. 35 shares of TMO ($5,000 cost)

Last week, I felt that Brexit was going to impact the markets in a negative way, so I sold all of my TMO for a tiny $125 profit. Turned out it was a prescient move, as HRL continued to move up despite the chaos and TMO trended down with the rest of the market. Whew! Almost became a TMO bagholder.

I have some cash in my brokerage account, but I need to transfer at least $200,000 into my brokerage to prepare for the biggest trade I will make in my ~~gambling~~ investing career - buy up at least 5,200 shares of T on Thursday or Friday so that I can get the August dividend payment. T's price has been trending up, given that people are flocking to utilities in this market crash, so I might have to buy fewer shares at a higher price. Either way, I plan to lock up at $2,400 in income. 

I am confident that T will only keep appreciating in price in the short term, so it's unlikely I'll end up being a bag holder as I hold T until July 11th. 

Once I get out of T with my guaranteed dividend payment, I'm going to really start gambling - if V goes below $70 a share, I might put half of my money into it. 

Another thing I'll be eyeing are bank stocks (WFC, JPM, BCS, UBS, CS), so I might put $5,000 into one or two of those. Banks are not going to fail, they will be bailed out, and plus, I think the bearishness over American banks in particular are overblown. I like European banks because, you know, YOLO. 

GILD is another trade I might toss $10,000 or $20,000 into. It has gotten so cheap, the market is just waiting for these guys to do a big acquisition, and I'm betting it will happen... eventually. 

And lastly, I might go long on AMD, put $5,000 into that around mid-July. I'm planning to buy an RX 480 at launch, so that must mean that AMD is doing something right for once business-wise (long-time Nvidia user here). 

The next couple of weeks are going to be great for longs - so long as you can withstand some short-term pain. Scared money don't make no money, as they say!",10

This is a follow-up to my post ""[Ladies and gentlement, it is officially time to panic DD](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/4puqu9/ladies_and_gentlemens_its_officially_time_to/)"" It goes without saying that I am surer than ever that we will break the 1,800 S&amp;P500 level.

A massive market crash is in the works. Make no mistake: this is the new financial crisis. People called the 2007-2008 events the Great Financial Crisis, well, this is the Greater Financial Crisis.

I limited my upside by selling puts at the 1,700 level. I don't think we will dip below that - not this year at least. I also chose a long expiration so I can close my positions in September if I need to, while keeping a good amount of time until expiration.

I am 100% convinced the market will have a massive crash and I guess I am putting my money where my mouth is. I wish I could short more, but this is all I have left now.

Fewer of us felt that Brexit would be the catalyst for it. Many people believe the market is going to be headed downhill soon, after this current rally we are seeing today is short-lived. However, just because the market is predicted to drop again doesn't mean it will be the big crash. Thankfully, we here at WSB have access to the one thing more useful than insider information. A man who's never been right.

/u/fscomeau, the anti-prophet, has his SPY PUTs out to Jan 2017. I think it is safe to assume, using a statistical analysis of the inverse-fscomeau formula, that the market will have its next major fallout/collapse the second his contracts expire. After all, he went ALL IN this time, guys. Thus, things are on a more grand scale this time around.

In the meantime, ride the waves of the short term bounces coming and going. Ride out your MSTX shares to the moon. Watch your YOLO plays net huge gains, and your safe investments fail miserably. Even the most bullish or bearish individuals here can't argue with a man who's been wrong 100% of the time.

Based on my initial research, I've kind of narrowed my choices down to TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, or Fidelity. They all have fees that are on the higher end ($8-$10 per trade) but I keep hearing about their research tools being top notch. Can anyone clue me in on what exactly these research tools comprise of? Are we talking analyst reports that are actually substantive (rather than the regurgitated, meaningless metrics that you might usually find on, say, Seeking Alpha?) 

The way I see it, if the research and data available on these platforms are actually useful in helping you make smart investments, then the extra few bucks you pay for TD Ameritrade or Fidelity should not be a big deal.

It seems the SP has lost value due to Brexit which is another decent buy factor. Q2 earnings will probably be shit as well.",13

Personally I turn into more of an indexer when uncertainty is abound. I don't know if the prices are going lower, but with index funds I can incrementally buy as the market slides without incurring transaction costs.

Some examples of decisions I've made:
I wanted JPM, WFC, BAC, research indicated WFC was best in breed but I bought VFH (Vanguard Financials Index) which has WFC as the top holding.

I wanted XOM on a dip and had also done previous research into TSO and PSX. I bought VDE which is 20% XOM.

Wanted JNJ, CELG, GILD, bought VHT.

16-06-28,4q79n6,"Big picture of what's going on in the markets","1. Before we knew there would be Brexit, weeks ago, the one thing intelligent people were sure of was that if there was Brexit it would be a short term shock to the U.S. markets because, in the end, it means very little.  The UK is essentially now saying it wants a leave deal that's almost as close to its current status in the EU as possible.  You're not going to see other countries having legitimate referendums. You see them called for by minority parties and stuff but countries that aren't remotely in as strong of economic shape are not going to look at the demise of the UK and be like ""oh sure me too""

2. Fast forward to reality and you had another big down day today, but also had VIX significantly down.  VIX is 30 days forward looking.  This is replicating #1 above exactly

3.  So what should you be doing (and please note this is just my view there's a lot of smarter people here and everywhere I welcome all thoughts)

Volatility is still high, but a lot of people here don't trade in selling vol.  If you don't know how to do that - you should be staying out of the market this week and next week

Because you're not missing out on anything.  It's going to be  a clusterfuck, rollercoaster ride, we're going into a July 4th holiday, etc. etc.

Save your money for earnings season, which starts again July 11th

Unless you have some very strong view of the world that you're willing to stand by as the market bucks wildly, there's nothing you're going to miss out on between now and 2 weeks from now.  Instead all you might have is a much smaller bankroll to play earnings season

If you do know how to sell vol I recommend going nuts because Christmas come early",21

It was recommended several times to me by different people to max out my HSA contributions so it can be invested tax-free.

Looking into it, however, it looks like my company uses HSA Bank for managing HSAs. Apparently they do not offer the ability to invest funds from the HSA. The funds do earn interest, but it's a very low amount (starts at 0.05% APY, increases to 0.5% APY at an account balance of $25k or more). If I have $5k in the account, it'll earn a paltry $10 of interest in a year.

Do I have any options? From what I understand HSAs are employee-owned so I'm free to choose the HSA bank that I'd like? The only information I see from my employer is 

&gt;""Once enrolled, you will receive additional information about your HSA from the Bank. HSAs are personal health savings vehicles rather than group employee benefits. Although [company] has agreed to forward contributions through its payroll system to the bank, it has no specifically endorsed Bank or any other HSA provider. You are not restricted from moving funds to another HSA, but [company] is not required to forward payroll contributions to another HSA provider. With respect to HSAs offer through the Bank, employers may not impose conditions on the use of HSA funds, make or influence any investment decisions with respect to funds contributed to an HSA, or receive any payment or compensation in connection with an HSA.""

So does this mean I can open an HSA with a bank that *does* allow investing of funds and then manually deposit funds into that account? Won't I be charged taxes on those funds since I am receiving them though?",1

16-06-27,4q4hby,Manipulating a Market after Futures Purchase,"A young accountant here, my investing knowledge is limited it building thanks to Michael Lewis and a few other authors, I have a question that may sound silly.

I'm currently wrapping my head around future contracts and arbitrage.  The question I have is the following, what stops an individual from buying a futures contract then manipulating the market to favor their futures contract which they sell.  For example, if you bought a short position future of something that you already own a lot of, then you sell everything you have enough to drive the price of the market down, then subsequently sell your future at a profit due to the fallen price.  Or conversely, you buy a long position future, then purchase a whole bunch of that commodity or what-not, driving the price up then cashing in your future.

I don't think what I've mentioned is possible because it seems to simplified, but if anyone knows how to simplify this a bit for me I'd really appreciate it.",0

16-06-28,4qbcgx,"A newbie's perspective before taking the plunge.","Greetings /r/investing,

In the past few weeks I've been preparing to enter the exciting world of investing and so I decided to impart some of my perceptions on how this all works and if you feel so inclined you can reply.

As an uneducated trader I started with cryptocurrency(don't downvote just yet) with marginal success but got out of that game soon after because while I believe cryptocurrency has a strong place in the future it is currently a very niche market with price fluctuations based mostly on memes. I believe it's one of the most toxic environments I've ever been in.

Soon after I was exposed to an employee matched 401k and tinkered with it obsessively. But I wasn't satisfied with the rate of return. I wanted to be more active with my investments while also earning a higher rate of return. 

I have no investment contributions or savings and just started working a ""real"" job @ 30 y.o. so I feel like I must aggressively invest to close the gap between those 8 or so years I missed out.

I frequent /r/stocks, /r/investing, /r/wallstreetbets, and regrettably 4chan biz, the latter two I'm thinking of exiting. To me those communities seem to be filled with gamblers, pump and dumps, profiting from the inexperienced, etc.  It's certainly an intoxicating environment as well but no a healthy one.

Yesterday I googled something along the lines of *Did Warren Buffett make wall street bets?*. In the brief biography I found you could certainly argue that he did make major bets but they all seemed very educated verging on the point of insider info. While the guy had impeccable business savvy it seemed like he rode the coat tails of Graham and others.

For normies like us we don't have access to a brilliant investor pointing you at stocks and we aren't able to visit with CEOs to discuss their business plans at length.

And lastly, value investing. Based on Graham and Buffett's careers I've been examining the real values of stocks and it doesn't seem to make sense at all. *Every* single stock I found was overvalued by large margins. Is it so binary as *invest in undervalued stock and don't invest in overvalued stock*? Wouldn't there already be an algorithm somewhere with a list that says ""The 100 most undervalued stocks"" and then they become instantly overvalued as people buy them?

These are just some musings of a likely ignorant novice that I hope will incite some type of advice. ",0

16-06-28,4q7sdf,Is it worth it to apply trailing stops to a long ETF position?,"I'm new to investing, I will be transitioning my savings into a portfolio mostly comprised of ETFs, and am wondering if I should should just take a standard long position (this is a retirement account), or if it is worth it to apply some trailing stop sell/buy logic to capitalize on short term downturns. 

As I understand it, the pitfalls to trading shorter term are:
- Higher tax bracket (actual federal bracket vs capital gains in a long position)
- No guarantee of success

Just based on the tax differences, where is the break-even point on whether it's worth it to day trade? My household federal bracket is 28%, so that would mean capital gains are 15%, a difference of 13%. So to end up with the same amount of money, this means that by day trading I need to outperform a pure long position by 13% for it to make sense, right? 

Also, what's the best tool for me to use to simulate a strategy based on historical prices?

These stocks have all taken a major pounding in the past few weeks amplified further by Brexit and it's shenanigans. Granted, Brexit will likely result in the fed not increasing rates this year due to ""global economic turbulence,"" but banks are still making money anyway and in the grand scheme of things Brexit will likely have next to no impact on the global economy or even the UK economy for that matter, but that's a different conversation for a different post. 

Anyway, $ZION passed their recent stress test, so they'll likely be raising their dividend; making them more attractive. That coupled with the recent meritless drop makes me think right now is a good buying opportunity, possibly seeing $29 a share by mid august. I bought in yesterday, and might increase my position if the price doesn't rocket up when the market opens.

16-06-28,4qbooh,Selling Volatility,"This is a simple idea that many here already use, and is very popular with people who enjoy making money. (I know many of you don't, so if not, don't bother reading any further.)

Selling Volatility on spikes in the VIX. Go look at any VIX chart and see how it falls back down. Now that you've done that, your first thought should be, ""How do I profit off of the fall back down?"" If your first thought is, ""How do I profit off of the huge spike upwards"" you are going to have a very bad time. Very bad. Lots of money lost, like what initially happened to me. 

Selling volatility takes the correct timing and generally a bunch of scaling into the position. Scaling in means starting the position with a lower amount of capital than you usually would, and increasing the capital in the position over time. For example, the past 3 trading days with XIV (Inverse VIX): Started with about 200 dollars in it on Friday during the drop, put about 400 more in on Monday. I was going to continue to average in as the market continued to drop but today it rebounded so I'll end up having meager profits. 

I will only go full into my position in XIV if the VIX spikes above 30-35. We only reached around 27 on this flash crash so probability of a fall back down was not in my favor yet, risk-reward was not in my favor, so I instead decided to scale in. I'll end up making money like usual, I have never lost on this play, but it won't be as much as I desired. 

Other people like using puts on the VIX or VXX to do the same strategy i'm taking, but those will involve Theta decay and other factors so I stay away from that option. XIV offers lower profits than the options play but allows you more time for the VIX to stay inflated. 

TL;DR.. Short the VIX when it spikes high, and if high enough (30-40 on the index) go balls deep into the short. Short it using XIV or puts on VXX. This is a very simple strategy but works extremely well. 

I know most of you probably already know this play, but just trying to help others out that don't know. It allows you to profit off of rebounds with higher profits than a simple 3x leverage ETF such as TQQQ and doesn't make you choose specific companies. ",38

The stock went up over 20% today, so I wanted to do more research on the company. Apparently these are warrants for $DRWI stock. I understand the textbook definition of stock warrants, but am curious if I even wanted to exercise these warrants, would I be able to do that without a more *traditional* broker?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.",3

# Description

First Solar, Inc. is a provider of photovoltaic (PV) solar energy solutions. The Company designs, manufactures and sells PV solar modules with thin-film semiconductor technology, and also develops, designs, constructs and sells PV solar power solutions. 

So they are the picks-and-shovels play in the solar business, not the owner operator of solar power. 

## Competition?

When it comes to competition their SEC filing is pretty stark, when it talks about 150 competitors.

&gt; We face intense competition for sales of solar modules, which has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced margins and loss of market share. ... Certain of our existing or future competitors may be part of larger corporations that have greater financial resources and greater brand name recognition than we do and, as a result, may be better positioned to adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole. Certain competitors may have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital, which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time. 

Nasty set of competitors and dynamics so it's impressive to see high operating margins and good returns on equity for FSLR.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
First Solar, Inc. | $3,958M | 25% | 15%
SolarCity Corp | $455M | -ve | -ve
SunPower Corporation | $1,520M | -ve | -ve
Hanwha Q Cells Co Ltd  | $1,982M | 12% | 27%
Canadian Solar Inc. | $3,328M | 6% | 16%
Solaredge Technologies | $464M | 15% | 35%
Trina Solar Limited  | $3,294M | 6% | 9%
JinkoSolar Holding  | $2,827M | 9% | 23%

## Performance

Furthermore it's great to see how the business has turns a good profit 3 years in a row.

Metric | 2015A | 2014A | 2013A | 2012A | 2011A
:--------|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:
Revenue | $3.6bn | $3.4bn | $3.3bn | $3.4bn | $2.8bn
Cash EPS | $5.37 | $3.90 | $3.67 | -$1.23 | -$0.72

First Solar, Inc. has $1,581M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 35% of the market value of First Solar, Inc. So the business looks like it's got a good buffer. 

# Wall Street says ...

The professionals on Wall Street have a $73.29 for First Solar, that implies an upside of 66% to their target. So don't be surprised that their recommendation to clients is *Buy*. 

# Valuation

The following table shows the key valuation metrics. At 10x earnings it's hardly an expensive stock, but the long-term growth outlook is negative. Given the recent performance it's hard to see how Wall Street comes up with that view. Plus the FCF yield looks healthy.

Companies|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|--------:|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------|
FSLR | $4,522M | 10x | -13% | 0% | 22%
SCTY | $2,224M | n/a | n/a | 0% | -ve
SPWR | $1,862M | 10x | 2% | 0% | -ve
HQCL | $1,092M | 8x | n/a | 0% | 16%
CSIQ | $793M | 6x | 13% | 0% | n/a
SEDG | $740M | 11x | n/a | 0% | 9%
TSL | $644M | 6x | n/a | 0% | n/a
JKS | $596M | 4x | n/a | 0% | n/a

# Dividends

First Solar, Inc. is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. And sadly, from their SEC statement

&gt; We have never paid, and it is our present intention for the foreseeable future not to pay, dividends on our common stock. Our Revolving Credit Facility imposes restrictions on our ability to declare or pay dividends. 

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -36% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 1%. For the three months ended 31 March 2016, First Solar, Inc. revenues increased 81% to $848.5M. Net income totaled $170.6M vs. loss of $60.9M. 

Is this fall-out from SunEdison?

It's hard to see solar energy going away anytime soon, and given First Solar has cost-competitive technology, maybe an advantage, and it's able to deliver scale to electricity providers, the future isn't cloudy? 

And if the future isn't cloud, does that mean it's bright?

16-06-28,4q8ukp,Algorithmic vs Discretionary trading. [i.e. Computer trading vs human trading],"I'm curious to know what people think between algorithmic and discretionary strategies. 

Personally, I was a discretionary technical trader until the past half year where I have focused my time on quantitative systematic trading. My discretionary trading did work (netting 3 figure % return in 2015). 

However as someone who strictly judges my performance objectively, I had constantly wondered whether my strategy genuinely does work, or whether I am just extremely lucky and that I am just an outlier on a normal distribution curve. [For example If 10 million people made 20 random trades in a row, statistically speaking around 9 of those people will get 20 correct trades in a row]

 I felt that the only way to determine if my strategy truly worked was to code it, and then backtest it on historical data. 

SO i want to know what other peoples views are on systematic/algorithmic trading VS human discretionary trading, and perhaps which one you believe is better?

Thanks!",1

16-06-28,4qc6s4,$RGR DD,"First off a bit about me. I'm that guy who posted a few times on $SWHC. You may remember my [""what you need to know going into earnings""](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/4mzpyj/swhc_what_you_need_to_know_going_into_earnings/) post. I also made comments including a [pre-earnings assessment](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/4oduiv/how_many_of_you_are_holding_swhc_through_earnings/d4bsoh8) of what the stock would do. If you applied my DD using a smart entry approach, you would have made 10-18%. I pulled the trigger a bit early and was on the lower part of that range.

This play is all about guns. Considering my audience, I'm assuming there won't be much of a moral argument. That said, I'm asking you keep this to financials. Pretend they sell teddy bears if you have to.

**Who is Ruger?**
Ruger is an American gun manufacturer founded in 1949 who produced a Luger (German handgun) clone. The company is technically named Storm, Ruger &amp; Co, but is more commonly referred to as Ruger. It was first publically traded in 1969 and is listed on the NYSE as $RGR.

**Why is Ruger different?**
Ruger's management is largely old school. 0 debt. Consistent dividend. No acquisitions. No interest outside of guns. If Warren Buffet bought or ran a gun company this would be it. As a result the stock is largely institutionally owned, and their shareholders are very loyal and passionate. 

**What does the market look like?**
$RGR &amp; $SWHC are largely tied together. When one is valued higher, the other eventually catches up, and vice versa. Both are strong brands, that do not lose market share. As consumer gun demand increases, they both proportionally increase revenue off of that demand. 

After $SWHC crushed earnings and increased guidance a couple of weeks ago, the stock has responded. If you followed my posts you expected this. The news was ""gun sales are slowing"" when in fact, taking in seasonality they were actually growing. We bought the NICS report dip, held past earnings and cashed in.

Funny thing is, [$RGR didn't move](http://i.imgur.com/FxxTjgx.png). From that June 16th earnings date for $SWHC to today, there is a 16.5% difference between the tickers. Even Brexit had a significantly bigger impact on $RGR than $SWHC. It's safe to say that there is a divide in the market between the two companies. A divide that history tells us doesn't actually exist. 

Put simply, $RGR is undervalued. I'm not sure if $SWHC is under or overvalued, there is significant uncertainty in my mind there, but if you go off of historical brand value and the trend of consumer demand $RGR is no question under fair market value.

**What does consumer demand look like?**
Because of gun laws, anyone purchasing a fire arm legally must have a background check performed. This results in an entry in the NICS database. That information directly correlates to new gun sales, and is released monthly. Its a wonderful catalyst that helps us make gains outside of earnings or news events. This information is published in the first week of a month on an unreleased date.

Here is the latest report: https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/nics/reports/nics_firearm_checks_-_month_year.pdf 

**What does the play look like?**
We have two immediate catalysts we are going to play (NICS and earnings). Much like we did we $SWHC. This time though, I'm recommending a buy before NICS numbers are released. Why?

Let's dig in. In May we had 1.87M checks. This is an 18.28% increase YoY and was reported as a downturn. Bullshit. If we expect the trend to continue we would see ~1.8M checks in June which is historically the lowest month of the year. BUT. Orlando happened. 

If you go back and look at December 2015 and December 2012 you will see ~1M jumps for both months. These were the last two shootings that approached the death toll of Orlando. Two things that are different this time around:

- June is seasonally one of the worst months, while December is seasonally the best month.

- The death toll and political rhetoric is significantly higher this time around. 

So a bit of a toss up here on how much of an impact Orlando really has. Keep in mind too that Orlando happened a few weeks into the month as well. What do we really need though for NICS numbers to be perceived as positive ?

I put together [this view](http://i.imgur.com/EvQJLw9.png) to help us predict. First an explanation on the colors. Orange and Purple are $SWHC's last financial quarter report. Purple and Blue are what we know from $RGR's upcoming quarter. Green is complete unknown.

As you can see I have filled out June already. Assuming the trend we were on for the year and last year's seasonality AND NOT ACCOUNTING FOR ORLANDO I am predicting a 17.7% increase YoY for June to 1.8M checks. Of course the news with such a number would be that gun sales are decreasing. This is our baseline.

Let's factor in Orlando. I'm trying to stay conservative here. Assuming 400,000 additional checks from the Orlando event, and applying half of those to June and half to July (we were 2 weeks in when Orlando occurred) we get to 2,000,000 checks. Personally I feel that is the floor. Added benefit that its a nice round number that is particularly newsworthy. 

**What is our entry?**
Buy this week and avoid Friday. The sooner the better to avoid any run-up in anticipation of June NICS numbers. I will be making my entry in the AM tomorrow, assuming the market doesn't strongly correct from today.

**What is our exit?**
I'm swinging this so I will very likely hold through earnings until after the 40% EPS dividend is distributed. That said, I'll provide a few updates along the way if you want to be more aggressive with your exit.

So it appears to me if you buy NPSNY you are getting a discount on their stake in Tencent and you get everything else for free.

As for why to do that. I know dick about their core business in Africa (print media, cable etc) but it's profitable. And they are basically a venture capital firm investing [all sorts of companies](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/naspers/investments). They own 17.4% of Flipkart which raised money at a $15 billion valuation (Morgan Stanley marked it down to $9 billion),  29% of Mail.ru, which is publicly traded, their stake worth over $1 billion. 30% of Abril a huge latin american media company, 47.6% of Souq which was valued at $1 billion recently etc. etc. etc. So many companies. 

Their core has a value &gt; $0. All of that VC stuff has a value far greater than $0. I can't find a reason not to pull the trigger on this. Other than the huge exposure to a Chinese internet company worth $200 billion. That could be shorted out to get everything else, though.

My question is: why is it that the share price doesn't more closely mirror the price set by Apollo? What's to keep investors from buying DRII en masse and then pocketing the quick spread on the stock?

Is it that:

*  investors are pricing in transaction costs?
*  investors are considering the risk of the deal falling through?
*  now that DRII is to be purchased, shares aren't available in volume to be purchased?

Gevo has developed a technology that uses a mixture of synthetic biology, metabolic engineering, chemistry and chemical engineering to produce isobutanol and related products from renewable feedstock.

Gevo’s renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels business is actually preparing to blossom with new arrangements in the past 5-years with big players like the US military or more recently with Alaska Airlines.

So as a case study I'm trying to pick a stock that I think would be a good long term buy.

Do you think Bayer AG would be a good stock to go long on (since I'm from Europe, I'm talking specifically about $BAYN.DE).

This is a summary of the stock:


Stat | Value
---|---
Last close| 89.11
52 Week range | 83.45 -138
Total revenue 2015 | 46.3 B (yoy increase of 9%)
Operating income 2015 | 4.39 B (yoy increase 15%)
R&amp;D expense 2015 | 4.28 B (yoy increase 19%)
EPS 2015 | 4.97
Forward P/E | 11.4

Bayer is currently in talks with Monsanto for talking other some parts of their business (although it seems that the initial bid was not accepted).

So, it is trading close to the 52 week low, might take over some parts of Monsanto and has good financials (imo).

16-06-29,4qhb98,WSB Weekly Herald: Idiot Canadian Trader Hailed as Hero After Sacrificing Self to Save American Economy,"***The Wall Street Bets Weekly Herald***

**Idiot Canadian Trader Hailed as Hero After Sacrificing Self to Save American Economy**

Flags nationwide flew at half-mast Wednesday, as retail and institutional investors alike spent the day contemplating the tremendous sacrifice made by an anonymous and incompetent Canadian trader.  

“He was an hero that we didn’t deserve,” said Citigroup Chairman Michael O'Neill in a somber press conference on the steps of the NYSE.  “Known only by his online username, FSComeau was a mystery to all, but we’ll also be forever in his debt.  Having paid the ultimate price to ensure the continued prosperity of our great nation, and despite his Canuck roots, he’s taught us the true definition of an American patriot.”

The man, known as both FSYolo and FSComeau (often shortened to FSC), was already widely known as the worst trader in the history of speculative investments.  Multiple sources have confirmed that his publicly posted trades, which he called “YOLOs”, were being tracked by hedge funds and institutions, one of the first retail trader-based indicators to be incorporated into multi-billion dollar strategies.  When the Brexit hit, and the S&amp;P was in a 5% free-fall, FSC shorted the market with every cent he had - sending a strong buy signal to Wall Street’s largest players and triggering enough demand for SPY to hold $200 and avoid a market crash.   

“This guy lost his ass time after time, but he never stopped trying” said a source within Dimensional Fund Advisors.  “So many funds were tracking him, it got to the point where the market couldn’t make a major reversal until he’d entered a six-figure position.  He was dumber than a sack of rocks, and I think we all feel a bit guilty today.  When it really mattered he had the cojones to step up and do what needed to be done.  We’ve taken advantage of him over the past few years, but in the end, he saved us all.  God bless that man, and may he rest in peace.”

When asked how they know that he’s dead, the source explained “I mean, there’s no way that guy hasn’t offed himself yet.  This ruined his life!  The fuck else is he gonna do?”  

A ticker-tape parade in his honor has been planned for Wall Street after market’s close on Friday, and President Obama is said to be preparing an executive order to designate June 27th as “YOLO Day”.  While his final resting place remains unknown, his last words to the world will forever be remembered by those he saved.  “A massive market crash is in the works… I wish I could short more, but this is all I have left now... Good luck to all, and #YOLO.”

After watching John Oliver's HBO special, i got to thinking - should i stop contributing to my 457 and just put it all into the Roth - then -  as a fidelity customer doing 75/25 into ITOT/IXUS.  
  
I have room in my IRA contributions to put my current 457 contribution there.  It appears that i have to stop contributing to the 457 for 2 years before i can withdraw the money.  Assuming that is correct, should I...and is a mixture of ITOT/IXUS/AGG (down the road) appropriate to make more money than the 457?

16-06-28,4qa2va,Am I wrong for thinking Brexit is being blown way out of proportion?,"Maybe some other autist can shed some light, but it seems like people and the market are being way too overactive. 

Worst case scenario, other solvent countries like France and Germany follow Britain's lead out of the union and eventually the whole EU collapses because no one else will be there to bailout shit countries like Greece. Ultimately though, these shit countries will learn that their socialist bullshit isn't sustainable and they're forced to restructure or collapse; all while the solvent countries continue to thrive no longer hindered by obligations to foot the bill for their commie cousins. Eventually leading to a stronger world economy. 

Additionally, I don't think there will be any major changes in Britain. Brexit will likely have little effect on domestic trade and foreign trade policy will likely remain relatively unrestricted as free trade agreements will likely be signed, as big business still control everything, plus anyone that's ever taken a first year econ class knows taxes and tariffs only create a wedge of inefficiency, and Brits tend to be pretty educated people. Also, people for the most part are lazy and don't want to deal with added bs like tariffs and other regulatory nonsense. Plus Britain already has their own money, so it's not like anything has to change there. 

I don't see Britain leaving the EU, or the collapse of the EU as anything significant enough to collapse the global markets or anything like that. The world functioned fine before the EU and will continue to do so without it, if need be. 

I think there's too much doom and gloom reported around the uncertainty of what is to come, but in reality shit really won't change.

We've seen almost a full recovery from the temporary dive due to Brexit fears. If Friday left you reeling about your portfolio, now's the time to unwind some of your equities.

I adjusted my allocation to a level I was comfortable with losing back in November. The S&amp;P had gone to around 2100 in February before some sharp dives in August and September. 

I see 2100 as a resistance point that won't give way in the near future. I'm probably wrong. The point here is that if volatility causes you to lose sleep, you need to reduce your exposure.

The dip in the S&amp;P 500, according to a 10 second look at Yahoo Finance, was from 2113 to a low of 1992 in trading during Monday's trading session.

All of this being said, I do believe in playing the long game with investing. But we literally had posts about suicide hotlines on Friday. If you can't handle the volatility, use this as a time to reduce your exposure.

16-06-28,4qac9h,Restoration Hardware (NYSE:RH),"Today we are going to discuss a leading luxury retailer in the home furnishings marketplace. The Company, Restoration Hardware (NYSE:RH) has a current market cap of $1.03 bn, and an enterprise value of $1.4bn (including cash of $338mm and debt of $707mm).

RH has hit a bit of a bump in the road over the past 9 months, to the tune of losing ~76% of its market cap (52 week high of $106.49, current price of $25.49). The decline has been driven by a number of factors including missing earnings, lowering guidance, and concern about the rent/lease expense associated with the Company's 69, notoriously massive stores (think 80,000 sq. ft+ per store) in the US and Canada.

RH competes with other home furnishing manufacturers/retailers including Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM), which also owns West Elm and Pottery Barn, Ethan Allen Interiors (NYSE:ETH), as well as non-public competitors like Mitchell Gold+Bob Williams and Arhaus Furniture. Others, like Pier 1 or Bed Bath and Beyond, are not great comps due to pricing differentials (RH tends to have a much higher average price point for furniture) and product mix. That peer group (WSM &amp; ETH) is currently trading at an average LTM EV/EBITDA multiple of 7.6x, and an average 2016E EV/EBITDA multiple of 7.2x. RH is trading at 6.0x LTM, and 7.7x 2016E.

Now you're probably wondering why I'd be pitching a stock that has shit the respective bed, so to speak. I'm sure at some point you've heard the phrase 'buy low, sell high' and there could not be a more opportune time to do so than with RH. From a value standpoint, if RH corrects to the average LTM multiple of its closest peers (7.6x), we'd be looking at a share price of ~$35, or a ~38% gain from current prices. However, I happen to believe there is likely an even more attractive outcome, and one that has only recently become available due to the massive drop in price at RH. As I mentioned earlier, RH is a premium brand and commands high product margins. Williams-Sonoma lacks a competitive product, but has a superior distribution strategy and is a clear leader in the eCommerce space. With virtually no debt, an acquisition of RH by WSM is certainly doable before even considering the synergy opportunities. RH would enhance their product offering by fulfilling the 'good, better, best' merchandise assortment, and even at valuations of $50/share it would still be accretive to EPS for WSM. For those of you doing the math at home, a $50/share acquisition would result in a ~100% gain from current prices.",28

Searching for a platform that would have a lot of stocks (mainly US) covered, equipped with essential technical analysis tools and also have options (probably the most important of three). Plus a nice addition would be an opportunity to use hedging strategies (trading options + their underlying simultaneously from one account).

Had my eyes set on Thinkorswim because I really like their platform but I am not too sure about it. First off, commissions are kinda crispy. For an account up to 10k it seems like commissions would eat up a lot of capital if my focus would be on frequent trading. Secondly, they are US based and I am from Europe and I guess that would bring about some technical difficulties (+extra costs?) in setting up an account. Thirdly, their fee structure is not that transparent imo, there seem to be some additional costs which I don´t fully understand either. But despite these drawbacks I still think ToS has what I need and is also a market leader in respective fields.

Does anybody have experience with ToS being non-US citizen? Are there better alternatives available for non-US traders (low commissions playing important role here)?",0

*Parallel to Brexit*: media narrative was vastly pro-stay, populist minority party figures were pro-leave. Bookies drastically miscalled this with odds for stay as high as 85% in the days before the referendum.

*Quality and Impartiality of Polling*: political polls always seem somewhat fishy, especially when they are conducted by media companies or their subsidiaries who depend on the elections being close to generate ad revenue and viewers. Statistics *GOD* Nate ""Trump will never be the Republican Nominee"" Silver's trust in the quality of polling certainly lead him astray.

**Can you tell me one reason the market bounced back?**

Thought so. Brexit is happening. This will wipe out the EU. I simply fail to see how the market could go up - it's basically impossible. This is the dead cat bounce to crush all other dead cat bounces. We went up for what reason exactly? Tell me again.

I am 100% holding my puts. When you trade, you have to hold to your guns. You can't let a little loss shake you off your trade.

I believe this comeback is probably just algorithmic market manipulation. As soon as people wake up and start to realize Europe is properly fucked, we'll break 2,000 faster than I cheat on my diet.

I guess if you are reading this, going short on SPY will give you an even better entry point. Good, but remember that you might have missed the boat altogether as well. We could be at 1,800 by now and you would all be crushed you missed it.

PREDICTIONS:

- Thursday, move down by 0.5%
- Friday, move down by 1.5-2.5% (the ""friday effect"")
- ~~Monday~~ **Tuesday, sorry**, up by 0.25% (at this point, bulls will give up).

16-06-29,4qdxp8,Husband and Wife friendly stock earning competition,"So my wife and I have decided to start investing in stocks. We've never invested before and have a good amount of money saved up.

I thought it'd be fun to make a competition out of our new adventure and hope it'll help us be more willing to learn and enjoy investing in stocks.

Our goals are focused on long term retirement growth. 

So what I came up with(and just came up with it a few hours ago) is we both have $1,000 to invest and whoever earns more in a year wins something.

I was thinking a year to decide a winner to keep us interested but maybe since were focused on retirement funds it'd be moot to pick a winner in such a short time.

Also since we are beginners I'm thinking we should both invest in mutual funds instead of individual stocks. 

Maybe use $500 for retirement/mutual funds and the other $500 for our 1 year challenge and make a rule on how many times we can trade in that year or any other rule.

Pretty much I am hoping for any ideas on how we can set up a competition and what rules we should come up with. So if anyone has any ideas that would be great and much appreciated!!

Let's say I open a long position with $3400, @3.40 x 10000 shares and the margin is 10:1 but I only use 1/10 of my account balance, so I don't take a biggest risk I could have.

I'm gonna use a DMA CFD provider, so the price will be the same with actual stock's price.

The question is, if the stock drops five percent today, I'm gonna lose 50% of my initial investment, $1700, but let's say I want to keep it. If the stock regains the losses and increases by four percent on the third day (~3.53), what happens? Can I walk away with the four percent ($3400 * 40% = $1360 - fees) I've made? Is there a catch?

16-06-29,4qi9p4,What value is there in investing in European stocks?,"I'm really curious. Even if I pretend Brexit never happened and wasn't even being considered I don't see the value in investing in European stocks. They really seemed to be pushed by financial advisors to be invested in as part of their mutual funds.

These are my observations.

Considering their pharmaceuticals:
I recently read news that Sanofi is trying to be do a hostile take over of TSRO. Also around a month ago Bayer also tried to use underhanded means to buy out Monsato. When american companies buy other companies out the acquires seem like the heroes. Perhaps it's press manipulation. But this way of negatively trying to acquire companies only harms the stock price.

Their economy has always been crap. So many countries supporting the worse off countries. Having no real boarders is honestly probably harming them this latest refugee thing is a good example. Having an influx of poor people constantly migrating isn't really good for an economy if there is no way to help them besides government funding.

Financial stocks are doing bad, when the economy is bad the financials do bad. They don't even grow.

I'm just a bit peeved since this brexit thing happened, and a month ago I was trying to talk to financial advisors managing my families portfolio with the conditions ""I don't want to be invested in europe"" I wasn't even aware of brexit at the time, and I got the run around with them saying ""I'm sorry we can't change our investment method to suite your needs, we must invest in europe. What we can do is find someone for you who can invest how you like but they'd probably take a 1.5% fee"" That made me go.. ""Then why do I even need you or them, I might as well invest myself."" 

Also the previous financial advisors we had heavily invested in europe, especially their financials.

16-06-29,4qibc9,You guys are still idiots. And I was right about today.,"Here's my market thoughts again for tomorrow. I figure you champions of industry could do with some analysis.

Today opened out of range, offered a slight auction downwards, before bulls picked up all of the available batons and ran then twenty handles into the close. Honestly, I cannot forsee a case in which we plop back down to 2000, or even 2020. The bullish argument has been so strong since we decided that 1980 was too cheap. The end of the month is tomorrow and there's the ol' 12:00 fade trade (mountain time, so 2PM eastern) that looks for a high to be made two hours before the close of the month.

I personally don't put any weight behind ""Sell at this time, you'll make a million bucks"" because that's just not how the market works. I think we'll see another gap open higher tomorrow around 2070--though not as crazily high as today--and a rotation lower by about ten points into today's POC of 2060. From this point, I expect choppy accumulation similar to Tuesday's midday action before we run an assault on the upper POC of 2080 to complete three strong bullish days.

Because 2067-2070 is one of the very few LVN's in the recent trading range, I am going to be careful about long entries there because it's a low R/R zone--that is, until the market starts pushing 2080.


If we get Thursday like Tuesday, I expect bounces from 2050 to 2062, before pushing to 2080.


On the other hand, if we gap higher into the 2075 range I will be anticipating choppy, mean reversion type trade like we saw Monday afternoon because of the wide POC up there. Of course this could all get blown out of the water if we gap to 2090 or 2100(!) but I do not expect a move like that to happen.


I had a decent trade today. I got long at an advantageous location early in the day (2051.25) but I exited much too soon for only five points. Had I held to the end of day, I would have banked 15 whole points! However, in the moment I was not expecting a large move and 5 points was more than enough to bank for a half hour's efforts. In the future, I need to practice scaling into a trade on a day like this off of +1SD vwap to build my position size and run the balance for eight to ten points.

# Description

L-3 operates through three segments: *Electronic Systems*, which provides a range of products and services, including components, products, subsystems, systems and related services to military and commercial customers; *Aerospace Systems*, which provides products and services for the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) market, specializing in signals intelligence (SIGINT) and multi-intelligence platforms, and *Communication Systems*, which provides network and communication systems, secure communications products, radio frequency components, satellite communication terminals, and space, microwave and telemetry products. 

Comparing it with it's peers, it's not one of the behemoths, and it's not got a particularly impressive margin or return. 

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. | $10,106M | 11% | 7%
Boeing Co | $96,597M | 9% | 85%
General Dynamics Corporation | $31,409M | 15% | 27%
Lockheed Martin Corporation | $47,723M | 14% | 105%
Northrop Grumman Corporation | $23,525M | 15% | 33%
Raytheon Company | $23,722M | 14% | 20%
Rockwell Collins, Inc. | $5,157M | 24% | 34%
Rolls-Royce Holding PLC (ADR) | $18,309M | 16% | 1%
TransDigm Group Incorporated | $3,000M | 44% | n/a
United Technologies Corporation | $56,135M | 17% | 13%

L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. has $3,102M of net debt. That is 2.7x it's latest operating profit. That's not troublesome, but it is on the high end of my comfort zone.

The professionals on Wall Street have a $149.45 for L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. and their recommendation to clients is *Buy*. That implies an upside of 6% to their target. Not too impressive either.

# Valuation

The following table shows the key valuation metrics. It's priced to be one of the fastest growers.

UTX | $82,875M | 15x | 8% | 3% | 10%

That view of high growth long term, seems odd looking at the history:

# Dividends
L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. is forecast to pay a dividend of $2.95 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $2.65 per share.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 18% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 3%. So sentiment's been improving, dramatically.

I find that hard to get looking at recent results where in the three months ended 25 March 2016, overall revenues decreased 5% to $2.35B. With the two largest divisions, Electronic Systems segment decrease of 14% to $903M, &amp; Aerospace Systems segment decrease of 2% to $1.01B. 

With the stock performing so strongly recently and little sign of earnings upgrades, I struggle to see what can drive this higher in the near term.

16-06-29,4qiiw1,Portfolio Construction With Leverage,"I'm curious about asset allocation plans more sophisticated than the basic ""x% in stocks and (100-x)% in bonds."" There has been [some](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1rab73/a_levered_5050_portfolio_is_better_than_a_9010_one) [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/430bn6/maybe_someone_will_find_this_useful_basic) on thinking about using leverage along with a more dramatic tilt toward bonds and other less correlated asset classes. 

As a starting point, as a younger investor (24), the plan I've considered holding in a margin account is:


Asset Class | Weight
---|---
US Stocks | 10
Intl Stocks | 10
EM Stocks | 10
TIPS | 10
Long Treasuries | 30
Intermediate Treasuries | 15
Commodities | 7.5
REITs | 7.5

Backtesting this portfolio from 1972 onwards gave an annualized return of 9.85% with a standard deviation of 8.81% and a max drawdown of 10.67%, so it seemed like a reasonable starting point.

The portfolio would be initially leveraged to ~1.5x, and deleveraged over the next two decades, and then moved to further weight in bonds.

What do you all think about this plan? If you're executing a similar strategy, how are you getting leverage, what does your portfolio look like and how has it been working for you?",4

I will pick up more of each to increase and decrease position as the market moves. Additionally because you all love to hate him, I am betting with Fs that the market bounced and should see down ticks in the near future. 

The position is small relatively but I just got a new job which means this is done from phone and not my desk which, turns out, is a lot harder.

AMD puts bought yesterday at peak, 6 - 5.5 puts Oct , .98 each. I have traded AMD multiple times over the last few years. It always bounces between 2.5 and 4.5 so I was always making that trade. It has some good tailwind right now but it think it is over bought so I am betting a fall back to 4.5 in the near future. OCT puts give me time to not stress and check each day at the new job. 

SPY puts bought right now. 3 - 207  puts July, 2.30 each. I think we will see a near term down swing. Additionally, I needed to buy time to get past the 4th and really let this brexit new PM stuff get people stirred up.

16-06-29,4qilcr,Scynexis,"Let's see if I get shadow banned.

So, I've been busy with work but this is my next bullish target.

Scynexis / SCYX has an anti-fungal
1) This is an oral formulation (as well as IV)

2) Other oral formulations exist, but they have up to 5% resistance

3) The company showed results in p2 that it is ""as good"" as the other anti-fungals for vajayjay yeast infection
-- The market reacted negatively to this, apparently expecting the drug to perform better. Would have been nice but the major point is this drug works, and will provide a second step for resistance strains

4) The larger market here is now step-down therapy.
--The fluconazole (standard of care for invasive candida) IV treatment will still reign as SoC, but this drug will likely be added as an oral-step down therapy to reduce chance of a recurrence

#4 opens up the possibility of a billion dollar market.

Currently, SCYX dropped after the ""positive"" p2 data, and didn't fair well even after this brexit green. 

Discount.
P2 is soon. (***FUCK I thought it was p3***)

What red flags am I missing here? Here are some stats that I just pulled from Yahoo Finance to illustrate my point.

16-06-30,4qm5n2,$GILD DD,"$GILD has fallen sharply since Q1 earnings this year, but I believe that their new HCV drug, Epclusa, is going to give the comeback that this company needs.

Epclusa has significant advantages over their competitors' ($ABBV/$MRK) HCV drugs, Viekira and Zepatier, being approved for use in patients within any hepatitis C genotype. Viekira, in contrast, is confined to genotype 1 patients and Zepatier to genotype 1 and 4 patients. 
&gt;There are multiple genotypes of HCV that exist in the world.
&gt;HCV genotype 1 is the most prevalent worldwide, comprising 83.4 million cases (46.2% of all HCV cases), approximately one third of which are in East Asia. Genotype 3 is the next most prevalent globally (54.3 million, 30.1%); genotypes 2, 4, and 6 are responsible for a total 22.8% of all cases; genotype 5 comprises the remaining less than 1%. While genotypes 1 and 3 dominate in most countries irrespective of economic status, the largest proportions of genotypes 4 and 5 are in lower-income countries.

In addition, $ABBV's Viekira is a multi-drug-per-day therapy that generally has to be used in conjunction with ribavirin, an outdated drug with a long list of side effects. Last fall, the FDA required a new label warning for Viekira for potential liver damage in patients with decompensated livers. $MRK's Zepatier isn't as bad as Viekira, but it has a treatment cycle of 16 weeks compared to Epclusa's 12 weeks.

tl;dr $GILD is at an all time low due to poor earnings in recent months. A few days ago, however, their new HCV drug was approved, and it is way better than any of the other drugs currently available. $GILD is going to go the moon as earnings rebound.",4

There's three stocks that I watch that I can't figure out what they do and why their prices do what they do/have done: NUGT, DUST and JDST


First of all, DUST and NUGT always move inversely to each other. I understand that one is ""bull"" and one is ""bear"" but what exactly are these stocks that when one falls the other rises? I've tried looking at the Drirexion website but I am just getting confused. Like I said, I've barely even dipped my toes into the world of stocks so a lot it is sort of overwhelming and I need a good ELI5 version of some of it.


JDST usually moves the same direction as DUST, but it doesn't say bear or bull it just says gold miners. Why does it usually move with DUST and when it does go the same way at NUGT, why the change?

Lastly, and again I feel like this is probably a dumb question and if I wasn't sort of on information overload trying to learn the basics of trading I could probably figure it out on my own, wtf is with all of these stocks 5 year performance? In 2011 NUGT was at $20,000, was at $18 in January of this year and is at $122 today. Did they dilute a bunch of really valuable shares into a bunch of less valuable shares, and do they just, like, not specify that when you're looking at the price? If that's the case, how the hell are you supposed to know when something dipped because of more shares existing or just becoming less valuable? Likewise, DUST surpassed $600 per share in 2013 yet today sits at just over $8, and JDST skied to over $3000 in 2013 yet today sits at a little over $9.


Is this a Robinhood shortcoming? Is this a lot simpler than I'm making it out to be? I don't want to come here as a ""do all the research for me"" kind of guy, but I am just confused as to wtf these stocks even do and why their highs/lows are so astronomically apart. Also what one rising means about gold in general.


Any help very appreciated. Just trying to learn a little bit here. ELI5...


TL;DR What are NUGT, DUST and JDST, what do they do, why are they so astronomically lower than they were in years past and why do they move inversely to each other (and what does it mean when they do)?",43
16-06-30,4qmg8e,WSB guide to getting started in the glamorous world of penny stock day trading.,"Are you ready to get started on being the next penny stock billionaire? Do you have what it takes? Do yourself a favor and start your journey to the moon here so you don't end up in over your head.

You first need to know if you are emotionally, mentally, and physically prepared for the high speed high stakes world of penny stock day trading.

Here is a way for you to evaluate your tolerance for the game.

First, you need to save up $110.14. You can get away with less, but you won't get the full effect of the simulation. Do not, under any circumstances, go higher. It is dangerous for reasons I will explain later, and sets unrealistic expectations of gains.

Head to the bank and take your $110.14 out in pennies and take it all home. You are going to want to remove the coins from the rolls to improve your liquidity.

Once you have all off your coins unwrapped, pick a penny stock you want to invest in on seeking alpha and copy all the information to a spread sheet labeled ""DD RESEARCH""

Once this is done, take 700 pennies, head outside and throw them in an open sewer. This is your trade commision. You will never see it again.

Now head back inside and take every penny you have and shove it up your ass as many as you can at a time.

Once you are done with that, head over to stock twits and study expert opinion while you let the heavy, dead, cold feeling in your bowel seep into the rest of your gut as you start to realize you have no idea why you just did anything you fucking did.

When you finally come to your senses and realize you fucked up, go shit all those pennies directly into the same open sewer you threw your first 700 into. 

Pay particular attention to how each penny feels as it squeezes past your anus. This is how you will feel agonizing every tick of your stock downward. If you accidentally shit out more than a 1000 pennies at the same time, call it market manipulation, declare it will gap up by friday, go back to the bank for more pennies and top off so you are back up to your starting ammount.

When you are done go back inside and reflect on the raw emptiness you feel inside and all the time you wasted with nothing to show for it.

If you are OK with all of this, then download Robinhood and start investing!",285

Instead of paying down on the mortgage, we want to take our hand at taking an extra $2500-3000 a year and investing it into a mutual fund for 10-12 years.  After talking over how much risk we want to assume and doing some research, we're down to these 2 funds.  Granted the Life Strategy is 65/35 vs Wellesley's 35/65   I've already opened a Taxable account through Vanguard, we're just not sure what fund to choose.

I know the expense ratio of Wellesley is .09% higher, but it has also shown a greater return in last 10 years as well, over 2% (although, I know past performance doesnt guarantee future returns).  

Seeing as this is a taxable account, is one fund better than the other as far as taxes go?  Even though Wellesley invests in less stock, the stocks it does invest in historically pay high dividends.  Will this affect my taxes every year?

Is there anything else I should be taking into account before choosing a fund?  Or is there another fund that I'm completely missing that is around the 50/50 allocation we're looking for.

16-06-30,4qmtpi,Leveraged portfolio - June progress,"I've posted quite a few times about leveraged ETFs and leveraged portfolios that include both leveraged stocks and bonds (e.g. risk parity portfolios).  I think many of the fears about volatility decaying the value of daily reset funds are grossly overblown (and this has empirically been shown to be the case).  The recent Brexit volatility is a good test of this, imo, as we saw a multi-day draw down in excess of 5%.  [Optimal daily equity leverage has historically been about 2-3x](http://ddnum.com/articles/leveragedETFs.php), though I expect if we are truly in a ""new normal"" period going forward, higher leverage amounts will be rewarded as volatility (and expected growth) will be lower.  Accordingly, this portfolio aims for equity leverage of roughly 2.3x ^[1]. 

Edit: Note that this is non-callable leverage (ie: not margin).  Some will argue that using leveraged ETFs is a poor way to gain leverage because of fees and compounding decay of daily re-balancing.  I disagree. Firstly, the ""cost"" of these things is relatively small, especially compared to margin or borrowing fees that you would incur anyway.  Second, by buying a leveraged fund in a cash account, I am making my risk of a margin call ZERO.  I will gladly give up some gains to offload my liquidity risk.  I don't want to end up like [this guy](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/4lwrrh/epic_yolo_onbogleheads/) and spend two years meeting margin calls because I wanted to lever up. Third, you can't get margin in an IRA/401k, making this the only way to lever up in that type of account.  And that's precisely the account type you *want* to lever up in, because then you can shield your gains from the government's grubby fingers. 

After lots of playing around and research and testing, I came up with a pretty comfortable allocation.  

40% SSO - 2x SPY  
20% UPRO - 3x SPY  
20% UST - 2x Intermediate Treasury (7-10)  
20% TMF - 3x Long-term treasury (20+)

Bought 30 SSO @ 66.26 - $1,994.8   
Bought 15 UPRO @ 66.7 - $958.00	 
Bought 17 UST @ 60.785 - $1,040.35   
Bought 10 TMF @ 95.1 - $1,007.50  

Total portfolio basis: $5,000.65

Today, the positions are at:

UPRO @ 66.1 - $991.20   
UST @ 64.23 - $1092.59  
TMF @ 115.78 - $1,129  

**Total portfolio value: $5,190.69, for a gain of $190.04, or 3.8% **

This month, other investments had the following returns:  

SPY: -0.63%  
VTI: -0.56%  
VBINX: -0.4% (Vanguard balanced 60/40 equity/bond fund)  

Not bad for a volatile month!  Obviously, treasuries have done very well this month (TLT is up 9%) but that's part of the point of this portfolio: including leveraged treasuries to balance the volatility of the leveraged equities.  Backtesting this portfolio for a few years shows returns that are roughly double the returns of the market but with about the same volatility, a much higher Sharpe ratio and lower market correlation.  [Here is the 5-year backtest](http://tinyurl.com/nevernoobbacktest) in case anyone is curious. 

The interesting thing will be seeing how interest rates going forward will impact this portfolio.  It appears that excess available capital continues to put downward pressure on interest rates, and I would expect real interest rates going forward to be lower than historical rates as more countries get their shit together, global standards of living rise, and people start having excess capital that needs a home.  Obviously, the bonds will get beat up during periods of interest rate increases, but I would expect that to coincide with (and be smaller than) an increase in the equity portion.  The net effect of this is hopefully above-market returns with similar risk.  

Edit: If anyone has any ideas on how to target ideal bond leverage, I'm all ears.  The three funds I would probably play around with are BND, TMF, and UST, to give 1x, 2x, and 3x leverage. If interest rates went to zero, for instance, I'd probably want to shift TMF to BND and de-lever significantly. 

*[1] I would probably be comfortable ramping leverage closer to 3x if the shiller P/E was 5 points below the trailing 10 year average, but I would otherwise want it to be closer to 2x.  Likewise, I would probably want it to be less than 2x if the shiller P/E was 5 points above the trailing 10 year average.  It's currently about 3 points above the trailing 10 year average - not a level that has ever been associated with a significant correction in the post-war era. But that can be managed by looking at overall portfolio leverage, not just this one aspect. In other words: I would add more funds to this sub-portfolio after a steep correction, but would make more traditional investments as the market is putting up new all time highs.*

16-06-29,4qfysw,Suggestions for a Bond ETF/Mutual Fund,"Just to clarify, this trade won't be placed on a site like Vanguard/Fidelity so there won't be any benefit or savings by selecting an investment that way.

-

So for an older person (low 60s) residing in New York can someone suggest an ETF or Mutual Fund to invest roughly $50,000. The money is sitting in cash and has built up over some time from dividends and interest income and this is to reinvest in the bond funds.

-
Some investments that might be appealing:

1. [iShares New York Muni Bond Fund ETF](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239767/ishares-new-york-amtfree-muni-bond-etf)

2. [Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund Admiral Shares](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0584&amp;FundIntExt=INT)

3. [Vanguard Long-Term Government Bond Index Fund Admiral Shares](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=1944&amp;FundIntExt=INT)

4. [Vanguard New York Long-Term Tax-Exempt Fund Admiral Shares](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundIntExt=INT&amp;FundId=0576)

5. [Vanguard Long-Term Investment-Grade Fund Investor Shares](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0028&amp;FundIntExt=INT)

-

(1) and (4) may be beneficial since the investor lives in New York. (4) requires a $50,000 investment so that would essentially be it but there is also a similar [ETF](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0076&amp;FundIntExt=INT). (2) is good because it gives you broad exposure.

30% VXC (Global All Cap ex Canada Index)

I've been doing it for about three weeks now, the first week or so was a bit stagnant as I was trying to learn how to analyze charts a little better and understand robinhood's system.

I recently got the robinhood instant upgrade but am considering downgrading soon as this method is not very effective with the day trade and volatility limitations on instant.

16-06-30,4qnt26,Jurble Securities initiates coverage of Twilio [TWLO] at Strong Buy with price target of $420.,"Despite its recent run, our firm's analysts see substantial upside to the TWLO common stock based on the following:

Consensus of Wallstreetbets that the stock is garbage is a strong contraindicator for forwards price appreciation. 

However, Cramer states that had the stock IPO'd a few years ago, it would have done so at 4x its IPO value - that is $60/share.  The inverse-Cramer effect would state that Twilio is a short target.

Yet, both inverse-Cramer and inverse-WSB are both perfectly possible in this situation - inverse-WSB by the simple expectation of appreciation and inverse-Cramer by expectation of a *higher* valuation above $60.

A target price of $420 is set based on an expected forward-P/E growth for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 at 69%.",23

16-06-30,4qnvup,Investing in my Health Savings Account,"Health Savings Accounts are funded with pre-tax income that is set aside to cover medical expenses and can only be used for medical expenses. I've been contributing the max ($3,350) and rarely get sick so I have ~10k in the HSA. I just found out that I can invest the balance in an assortment of 12 Vanguard mutual funds. The max deductible on the insurance plan is $1,900 / yr and I'm financially secure, so prepared to take some risk with the money.

Since I can only use the HSA for health expenses, does it make sense to invest in the Healthcare fund with the thinking that if health expenses go up, the fund will too? It's an interesting situation since I can only use the money for health expenses. Alternatively I would probably just invest it in a conservative grown fund.

16-06-30,4qkiwt,Holding a lot of EUR. What to do with it in light of Brexit ?,"I (35, mainland Europe) sold my company two years ago, and am holding a few million EUR across several bank accounts.

I have read up on some investing, FI things, etc. That has lead me to believe I need to put money in index funds and bonds. I like to take things slow, so over the past year I've put in 300k (25% world bond, 75% world index). (Is it smarter to use world bonds or EUR bonds as a European?)

I am not looking for a quick profit, but I do want to protect myself from major losses. Brexit has made me lose a few % on that 300k, but that is not what worries me at all - I'm worried about the rest of the EUR I still have in my bank accounts. I don't expect a domino effect, but I didn't expect the Brexit either. In case of said domino effect, the EUR might drop off a cliff, the banks holding my EUR may fail, etc.

What is the smart move to protect that money? Just do nothing? Put half of it in USD (as EUR/USD has already dropped, isn't this an instant loss) ? Gold (I still don't understand why gold has any value to anyone at all) ? Bonds? Matresses?

16-06-30,4qkl2d,Professionals: Can you give us some insight into the assumptions that have been fed into equity valuations throughout this past week?,"I'm hoping for some answers that can give us, in very general terms, how the market is thinking about Brexit. Specifically, I'm wondering what are the assumptions that caused the drop on Friday and Monday, and what changed to bring the S&amp;P almost back to pre-Brexit levels. 

Last Friday when the market dropped, I thought that valuations changed based just on the effects of Britain leaving the UK. (e.g. higher import taxes on foreign goods being sold just in the UK.)

But, based on how the market has rebounded, my theory is now that when the Brexit results were announced on Friday, investors assumed the worst - that Brexit would lead to the dissolution of the EU (leading to higher import taxes on foreign goods sold throughout Europe rather than just to the UK). After the weekend, investors firmed up their analyses which lead to an even steeper drop. However, after statements by Merkel and other EU officials that they would work their damnedest to keep the EU together, investors backed off their doomsday assumptions and kept their valuation based just on the effects of Britain leaving the EU, which led to the the rebound we have seen over the past couple of days. Is this about right or am I totally off the mark here?

I'm hoping to get some insight into the current situation, but also some insight into how analysts think about macro events in general and what causes these drastic swings in valuation.

## Recent financials
 
Looking at recent data, the top line looks like it's hit a tough patch.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $4.7bn | $4.4bn | $4.6bn | $4.9bn | $4.8bn|
|EPS | $1.19 | $1.13 | $0.95 | $1.01 | $0.92|

## Competition

In their SEC filing they point out that there are a lot of indirect competition ...

&gt; We compete for the leisure time and discretionary spending of consumers with other interactive entertainment companies, as well as with providers of different forms of entertainment, such as motion pictures, television, social networking, online casual entertainment, music and other consumer products.

... and some pretty large direct competitors:

&gt; We compete primarily with other publishers of PC, online, mobile, and video game console interactive entertainment software. In addition to third-party software competitors, integrated video game console hardware and software companies, such as Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony, compete directly with us in the development of software titles for their respective platforms. 

Though compared with EA and TTWO it's margins are pretty healthy.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Activision Blizzard, Inc. | $4,841M | 35% | 11%
Electronic Arts Inc. | $4,396M | 25% | 36%
Hasbro, Inc. | $4,565M | 19% | 31%
Mattel, Inc. | $5,649M | 14% | 14%
Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. | $1,414M | 9% | -1%

Activision Blizzard, Inc. has $2,969M of net debt. That is 2x it's latest operating profit. Not alarming, but high all the same.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $42.58 for ATVI and their recommendation to clients is *Buy*. That implies an upside of 12% to their target.

# Valuation

The following table shows the key valuation metrics, unlike the traditional toy companies, the games industries dividends are a pittance. Valuations are strong and free-cashflow yields are low.  

View Peers|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------|
ATVI | $28,067M | 21x | 19% | 0% | 6%
EA | $22,224M | 21x | 15% | 0% | 6%
HAS | $10,359M | 20x | 15% | 2% | 8%
MAT | $10,554M | 23x | 12% | 5% | 11%
TTWO | $3,107M | 28x | 12% | 0% | 2%

# Dividends
ATVI is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.15 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $0.26 per share. A decline is a surprise! Though maybe this is to help reduce the debt levels incurred after buying Candy Crush maker, King.com. 

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 12% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 3%. So sentiment has improved.

The business is firing on all cylinders with revenues up 14% in the last 3 months, and good growth in all key regions. Is this the King.com acquisition come into the figures? Or is it now an engine of growth? Is the mobile expertise this brought to the story the key?

&gt;The system has run up against economic limitations and metaphorical walls that are due to the way capital accumulation works. The need for 3% compound growth, ever cheaper labor pools, the imperative need for consumers with the necessary buying power for consumption, contrasted with stagnant or lower and lower wages that are not conducive for that necessary consumption, limited resources, finite accessible new markets, and a level of greed that exceeds the wildest imagination of our ancestors of just 100 years ago. These internal contradictions are what will end this era.

&gt;In short we have reached the point in human history where the system that once built the world around us and which once improved the lives of much of society has now gone retrograde and will no longer permit stability and prosperity for the mass of humanity. This inflection point is but the beginning of the end and it will be a long drawn out and brutal collapse. Yet, simultaneously, the seed has been planted for the next economic structure.

16-06-30,4qldg6,Trending Value: Breaking Down a Proven Quantitative Investing Strategy,"The trending value strategy was developed by James O'Shaughnessy and detailed in his book What Works on Wall Street as one of the best performing strategies, using a combination of value and growth metrics.

Every metric in this strategy is commonly used by millions of investors every day; but when they are combined in a specific way, the results can be extraordinary.

[Cumulative % Return, Trending Value vs All Stocks \(1964 - 2009\)](http://i.imgur.com/toENS0y.png)


[Portfolio Performance, Trending Value vs All Stocks \(1965 - 2009\)](http://i.imgur.com/1VEmLIm.png)

O'Shaughnessy begins by backtesting strategies using one value metric at a time. For example, a strategy that is only invested in the stocks in the top decile (lowest 10%) of price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) and rebalanced every year. And likewise using price-to-book ratio (P/B), price-to-sales ratio (P/S), and price-to-cash flow ratio (P/CF). He also looks at enterprise value to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxs, depreciation and amortization) ratio (EV/EBITDA), which was the single best performing value factor he backtested. (For each of these 5 factors, low values are better).

Another factor he looked at was shareholder yield (SHY), which is buyback (how many stocks are repurchased by the company (i.e., decrease in number of outstanding shares)) plus dividends divided by market capitalization. (For shareholder yield, higher is better). The results for the top decile of these factors (lowest (or highest for SHY) 10%, rebalanced annually) are below (with all stocks for comparison).

[Performance \(1965 - 2009\)](http://i.imgur.com/Mn17pXe.png)

By themselves, all of these factors beat the overall stock market. But combining the factors, coming up with a composite score and investing in the top decile of composite scores, yields even better results. To develop the composite scores, a ranking for each factor is given to each stock in the universe of stocks. So the stock with the lowest P/E gets a score of 100, the stock with the lowest SHY gets a 1, and so on (this can be done with the PERCENTRANK function in Excel (or 1 - PERCENTRANK for SHY, since higher numbers are better), or much more seamlessly using a more powerful tool like Portfolio123).

The ranks for each factor of a stock are added up for its composite score. O'Shaughnessy looked at 3 different value composite scores: value composite 1 (VC1) used the factors described above except SHY, value composite 2 (VC2) add SHY to VC1, and value composite 3 replaces SHY with just buyback yield. The returns for top decile of each of these composite scores is below (rebalanced annually).

[Performance \(1964 - 2009\)](http://i.imgur.com/8KSY0vu.png)

Each value composite is a significant improvement over any individual factor. Composites are more powerful than just screening for the best values of the individual factors because a stock that may be deficient in one metric but excellent in the others would get eliminated from consideration by screening (e.g., a stock in the top decile of VC2 may not necessarily be in the top decile for all of the individual factors).

To implement the trending value strategy, you simply invest in the top 25 stocks sorted by 6-month % price change (the ""trending"" part of the name) among the top decile of stocks ranked by VC2 (O'Shaughnessy chose VC2 over VC3 because of its slightly higher Sharpe ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted return).

The universe of stocks is limited to those with a market capitalization of more than $200M (in 2009 $) to avoid liquidity problems with trading smaller stocks. It's a buy and hold strategy that is rebalanced annually with the following exceptions. If a company fails to verify its financial numbers, is charged with fraud by the Federal government, restates its numbers so that it would not have been in the top 25, receives a buyout offer and the stock price moves within 95% of the buyout price, or if the price drops more than 50% from when you bought it and is in the bottom 10% of all stocks in price performance for the last 12 months, the stock is replaced in the portfolio.

So what's the catch? There are a few:

* The Data: While most of the metrics described are freely available from any number of online sources, some (e.g., buyback yield) aren't as easy to come by, and I still haven't found a free way to obtain all of the data for all of the stocks at once.
* Psychology: While the trending value strategy has never underperformed the market for any rolling 5-, 7-, or 10-year periods between 1964 and 2009, it has underperformed the market for rolling 1-year periods 15% of the time, and 3-year period 1% of the time. If you hit a few years with less-than-stellar performance, are you going to stick it out and trust the strategy, or are you going to jump ship to bonds (as many people did in 2009, missing out on the huge subsequent rebound) or another trendy strategy that seems to be performing better at the time?
* Commissions (for small-time investors): At $10/trade and 25 trades per year, you need a portfolio of $100,000 to keep your commissions to a reasonable 0.25%. (Hint: use Robin Hood)",153

In particular, the proposed titration scheme for clinical practice was significantly different from the titration scheme used in the Phase 3 trial leading to discordance in titration decisions between the Phase 3 trial and real-world clinical practice.
