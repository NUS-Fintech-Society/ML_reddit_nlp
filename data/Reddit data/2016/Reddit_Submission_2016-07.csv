16-07-01,4qovww,"What, if any, correlation exists between the initial size of an investment portfolio and its expected return?","I'm currently reading Piketty and he makes the argument that financial globalization fosters an ""inequality of returns,"" where the return on investments is correlated with the initial investment amount. So one's initial wealth is a factor in the rate of return they're able to achieve.

Does this claim have merit? Can anyone elaborate?  Is choice of investment vehicle a factor? Access to insider opportunities, advice or advantage?

This makes me think about index funds and how they're a tool, used by the masses that, by definition, will not achieve exceptional returns. Further, those at the top of the wealth pyramid, benefit from the commoner's purchase of index funds, because we're purchasing their company. Maybe these points are inconsequential, but I can't help but think of them in this context.

I'm curious what this forum's opinions are of this statement.

i like the owner. wynns conference calls are the best. he is very straight forward and funny.

earnings aug 3rd.

currently at RSI 39, pretty low, and bouncing off the bottom bollinger band. its just below its 50 day MA of 94.55 and current price is around 90. it was 100 just a week ago and has lost all its gains since may. back in april it also topped close to 100.

post BR exit it has not recovered as well as the rest of the market.

i see MACD not looking so good now, so maybe it goes a bit lower. but it has really solid support at 88. below that there isnt much support. maybe 85 and 80. highs in december were over 100 and it fell most of 2015.

gambling is gambling long term i have no idea what this will do. id think that online gambling and fantasy takes away from them a bit. younger generations dont enjoy casinos as much. smoking/drinking/blowing your cash isnt as cool. its cool to get coke and hookers and open up your trade window instead.

tourism im not sure. with the election and terrorists. id call that a wash compared to last year. i dont see it being a big deal. legal weed might boost it a bit even, if vegas becomes like an amsterdam.

thinking of opening some calls a few months out. hoping it goes up to high 90s or even 100 and just offing them.

also i heard a few people say they like the setup on streams, not that it matters. esp at a lower price, which we have now thanks to BR.

was using this chart. http://imgur.com/y7apjgF

16-07-01,4qpy9g,"Turnover's impact on portfolio costs","**shameless repost from /r/personalfinance**

A fund's stated expense ratio is **not** the true and *fully loaded* cost of ownership for that vehicle. 

Think of the way price tags in most stores do not include the sales tax cost and the amount ultimately exchanged at the register. 

We all pay these other hidden ""friction"" costs when a fund is re-balancing, adjusting, or just plain maintaining its portfolio. Unless you only own individual company stocks, there is no escaping it. 

Bogle has a [great paper](http://johncbogle.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/FAJ-All-In-Investment-Expenses-Jan-Feb-2014.pdf) out in the ""Financial Analyst Journal"" on calculating the ""all-in"" price of an investment. Check out page 3 for his methodology and page 5 for long term impact on returns versus passive / low turnover index funds.

When I do my periodic portfolio analysis and it's associated cost, I not only log the stated expense ratio from the annual statement and multiply it by the average NAV over previous 12 months; I also add a certain ""multiplier"" as a percentage of turnover to account for these ""hidden"" transaction costs. 

I currently use (**0.8%** * *turnover* + *expense ratio*  = *""all-in"" price*) to estimate fully loaded costs. I use 0.8% based on an interview I heard with Bogle where he stated that for every 100% in turnover of a fund's portfolio, the transaction/trading costs are an *additional* 0.8% of assets (he wasn't clear on whether ""Assets"" meant NAV or market price, but I assume NAV)






**TL;DR**

Expense ratios (ER) are only a piece of the puzzle. 

I use 0.8% as a multiplier of portfolio turnover added to ER for estimation of *fully loaded* expense

**Was curious how other people in the community tackle this issue and what is your method and/or ""multiplier""?**",6

So DGAZ tracks the natural gas futures and how badly it does. So for you fucking retards, it means we want natural futures to go to zero for DGAZ to go up.


Natural Gas futures are currently hovering at the levels similar to last years futures of the same months. Given the current sentiment of higher temps and global warming and all that fucking good jazz, these futures are gonna stay up by 2.9$ and will probably break 3$ a contract. August is expected to be a hotter so that means DGAZ is still gonna head down. This would also mean you might want to start loading up on this position in a less retarded manner and may want to start with a small position and average down with increasingly larger share quantity purchases.

Production has also been decreasing up til the month of April 16 and May 16 numbers have not been released but historically, May should have a higher production compared to April but declined in the year of 2015. 2015 also had similar weather temps as this year but the trend of the 2015 futures when compared to the current futures says that we should be expecting an increase in production.

Open interest is also moving upwards and will most likely continue the bullish trend uptil mid august for the contracts meaning DGAZ should be fucking cheaper for you asshats to buy. 

I will be making a move in August or even before that depending on pricing and sentiment.

# Description

Kinder Morgan is an energy infrastructure company in North America. The Company segments include Natural Gas Pipelines, carbon dioxide (CO2), Terminals, Products Pipelines, Kinder Morgan Canada and Other. 

So it's a picks-and-shovels business, not actually doing the Exploration and Production.

## Recent financials 

A look at the last five years shows a mixed picture for revenues, a worrying trend of EPS below Dividends and a massive increase in long-term debt.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $14.4bn | $16.2bn | $14.1bn | $10.0bn | $7.9bn|
|EPS | $0.10 | $0.89 | $1.15 | $0.35 | $0.74|
|DPS | $1.93 | $1.70 | $1.56 | $1.34 | $0.74|
|Long-term debt | $40.7bn | $38.3bn | $31.9bn | $29.4bn | $13.3bn|

## Competition

From their SEC filing:

&gt; The market for supply of natural gas is highly competitive, and new pipelines, storage facilities, treating facilities, and facilities for related services are currently being built to serve the growing demand for natural gas in each of the markets served by the pipelines in our Natural Gas Pipelines business segment.  Our operations compete with interstate and intrastate pipelines, and their shippers, for connections to new markets and supplies and for transportation, processing and treating services.  We believe the principal elements of competition in our various markets are location, rates, terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service. 

And of course they have a good record on these fronts. But of course their it a separate issue to think about too... it's not just competition from other pipeline businesses but also about natural gas versus other energy sources!

&gt; Shippers on our natural gas pipelines compete with other forms of energy available to their natural gas customers and end users, including electricity, coal, propane and fuel oils.  

## Metrics

KMI's clearly operating well with some of the highest margins in the industry. 

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Kinder Morgan Inc | $14,001M | 48% | n/a
Columbia Pipeline Group Inc | $1,359M | 41% | 6%
Enterprise Products Partners L.P. | $24,561M | 20% | 12%
Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. | $2,186M | 48% | 43%
Spectra Energy Corp. | $4,995M | 50% | 2%
Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. | $21,321M | 8% | 2%
Williams Companies Inc | $7,304M | 43% | -ve

Kinder Morgan Inc has $43,178M of net debt. That is 6x it's latest operating profit. That's a lot of debt! And actually exceeds their market value. So it should be no surprise to anyone that this stock has traded as low as $11 and high as $28 in the last year.

# Wall Street says:

The professionals on Wall Street have a $20.79 for KMI and their recommendation to clients is *Buy*. That implies an upside of 12% to their target.

# Valuation

The following table shows the key valuation metrics. The entire sector is highly rated on the PE front because the view is these are trough earnings. i.e. that the earnings are suppressed by the cycle. For example KMI's forecast of $0.70 is well below the 2013 figure of $1.15. But are you confident the market is turning?

View Peers|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------|
KMI | $41,351M | 27x | 9% | 3% | 6%
CPGX | $10,202M | 39x | -2% | 2% | 7%
EPD | $60,156M | 21x | 4% | 6% | 12%
MMP | $17,364M | 22x | 8% | 4% | 10%
SE | $25,052M | 30x | 8% | 5% | 9%
PAA | $10,894M | 22x | 2% | 10% | 8%
WMB | $15,641M | 28x | n/a | 11% | 7%

# Dividends

Kinder Morgan Inc is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.50 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $1.25 per share. That is a large decline. However it's still a 2.7% yield and it get's DPS back under the EPS forecast.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 4% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -3%. So the valuation has risen marginally. This is against a backdrop of revenues down 11% in the last 3 months and net income down 36%.

Looking at the analysis on [Seeking Alpha](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KMI/focus) the bulls are really impressed with the cash generation, and unphased by the debt levels or capex plans. The bears are worried that the cashflow will not make it to shareholders anytime soon.

For now, I'm scared off by the volatility, valuation and debt levels. But would be happy to be persuaded otherwise.

* How old are you?
* Are you employed/making income? How much?
* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)
* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)
* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
* Any big debts?
* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.

16-07-01,4qrw3x,HTZ HRI spinoff,"I bought $HTZ (on Jun 27 at $9.90).  Today I read a couple descriptions of the the HTZ, HRI split but don't understand it.  
  
I assume (by the price) that HTZ is trading today priced after the reverse split (which I think is one for five), and I assume after the spinoff as well.  But Merrill Edge doesn't show any transaction yet, so I'd like to know how many shares of each I actually own.  
  
The news implies $HRI should be trading priced before a 15 for 1 reverse split.  But the price seems to imply it is trading after that.  
  
So for each 15 shared of HTZ I bought on Jun 27, I think I have 3 shares of HTZ and 1 share of HRI.  But I'm not sure and would like to know (and don't know how soon Merrill Edge will correct the info in my account).",6

I'm 22 years old making $50k a year. My 401k with match is in Principal LargeCap S&amp;P 500 Index Separate Account. Which is 100% invested in stocks. My Roth IRA is with vanguard in a target fund VTTSX(2060).

I have a couple good options with my HSA through health equity and they are as follows.

•VGSNX - REAL ESTATE

•VIIX - LARGE BLEND

•VEMPX - MID CAP BLEND

•TPLGX - LARGE GROWTH

•VIGIX - LARGE GROWTH

•VSMAX - SMALL BLEND

16-07-01,4qsp6y,A treatise on the current macro economic outlook.,"Dear Gentlemen, 

this is to bring to your notice that although the Brexit *referendum* has taken place, there is no evidence whatsoever that the current political confusion in currently headless UK is going to be resolved soon. Mr. Carney has *indicated* that easing might be necessary, this should not be a reason for the exuberance being seen.

Furthermore Gentlemen faggots, the fact that lending in big asian hubs like Singapore and Hong Kong has basically dried up for purchasers of property in the UK, it might lead to a significant drop in the already inflated housing prices mainly because it is uncertain how long the the situation remains bad.

Gentlemen buttslaves, it is imperative - I say *imperative* dear sirs, to not lose track of how bad the banks in Europe are positioned. A €166 billion guaruntee for providing liquidity for Italian banks was approved just days ago.

Please keep in mind Gentlemen jizztrumpets, the currency swings currently do not bode well for earnings as well as derivatives.

I would remind you dear cocaine whores, that the manipulation of reserve currencies might well lead to turmoil in the emerging markets.

So after you have gone and fornicated yourselves to your heart's content, please keep these macro outlooks in the back of your head as you slam your foreheads into the wall at your everyday loss making ventures.

Your's sincerely,

Vanguard von DeezNuts.",32

There has been no movement of capital (distribution or contribution) since last month. I have switched methodology to reporting at month end, so some of the performances last report have shifted to June. 

Performance:
May: -2.2%, June: 12.4%, Since Start: 9.9%

Current 1 month performance is 12.4%, primarily driven by the rally in GDXJ on the backs of brexit volatility and a continuing recovery in EM sentiments given now lowered expectations of rate hikes. I have closed my short SPY position on June 28, given the strong bullish reaction of the us market and covered with a selldown of a similar sized position in IEF and as a result avoided significant losses, but will re-establish the position over the coming months. I sold down 35% of my position in GDXJ to avoid the uncertainty prior to brexit. 

New position added include a 3k position in JD.com. I think there is significant discount to chinese listed companies in the US and hate for Chinese companies on this subreddit. I think the amazon model of JD wins out in the long run versus Alibaba and the company could be a potential 10 bagger given the leapfrogging potential of Chinese retail. The main risk is currency going forward.

The Brexit drop has now given us a lower high and lower low. Traditionally that is what we call a ""Down trend"" 

Also note the sloping trendline today which we've rejected. As price goes lower from today's high if you were to look at a daily chart you'd see a pattern called a ""shooting star"" where price reached an intraday high but sellers forced the price substantially lower. This is also generally a bearish sign.

The Brexit drop was from about 2113-1991 = 122 basis points. If am right about the wave count the next wave down has a first price target of around 1900-1910 where the next wave will be 197 points down. (122 x the fibonacci 1.618) if not then the lower target would be around 1782 where abouts 122 x 2.618 would be the number of basis points we drop.

Couple that the the fact that Utilities, Gold and treasuries have been leading. This is not typically normal bull market behaviour to see the safe haven trades leading. 

Bond Yields continue to drop world-wide.

16-07-01,4qtpkb,Petrobras Securities Litigation question,"So I guess I'll start off with a little bit of background information regarding my situation. Let me preface this by saying I'm sorry for any lack of knowledge/proper terminology. I also don't mean to break any subreddit rules if I do by posting this, but I'm pretty lost for the most part. 

Anyway...

My dad was an experienced investor. Since he was retired, he would spend his day watching the live ticker on his laptop with ""Squawk Box"" or any other stock program on in the background. Back when I was in high school, my dad and I opened an account for me to trade stocks on and invest the little money I had. I'm the very frugal type, not one to spend my money and would much rather invest it for future savings, so I agreed. My dad oversaw the account, making any sort of purchases or sells he saw necessary (I trusted him 100%), and would be thrilled to tell me about it after I got home from school. I was ecstatic to watch my savings grow and learn about what happened to the market that day.

 This went on for a few years. I moved about 5 hours away to go to college. While I was away, my dad still maintained my account, and everyday was eager to call me up to tell me how my stocks are doing. During this period, he purchased Petroleo Brasileiro SA Petrobras (PBR) in the beginning of September 2013 and sold in the middle of September 2013. He once again purchased PBR in the beginning of January of 2014 and sold in the beginning of April 2014.

In July 2014, my dad passed away unexpectedly from complications with cancer that he has had since 2001. As the days and now years went by, I hardly paid attention to the stocks I have left on my account and since they are pretty safe stocks, more or less forgot about them.

Fast forward to a few days ago and I receive a letter in the mail about a class action lawsuit regarding Petrobras and there are a few questions I thought you guys can maybe help me out with.

My first question is, realistically, how much money can I expect to get from this class action lawsuit? Is it $20, $2,000, or more?

My next question is, does the amount you invested in the company depend on the amount you receive from the settlement? I'm not sure what is considered a ""large investment"", but the first time in September I bought 318 shares at $13.97 and sold all 318 shares about a week later for $14.20. The second time in January I bought 250 shares at $12.89 and sold all 250 shares at $13.15.

Finally, my last question is, does anyone have an idea when this is supposed to be settled? Will the entire process from the beginning to the final payout be a month or a year or longer? and how far along the process are they?

Any other information you think might be worth telling me is greatly appreciated! Thank you guys once again and I look forward to getting some answers to this!",1

They're as high as 5.75% on some of these funds for the share class that is available to our plan. Does that mean that every time I invest in that fund, the fund is charging a percentage of the sale?

Working a full time job I hate, doing regular long term investing with Roth and brokerage accounts at Schwab.
Should have a significant deposit in the near future to get me over the PDT rules, so now I am limited to 3 day trades a week which I check all day while working.
I have day traded VXX and USL last Thursday, Yesterday and today was SIVR.
I begin watching the open and check out volume and where that leads selling or buying. I look at potential day trades I have scoped out and pick one.

Right now my day trade watch list is:
AA, VXX, XIV, UNL, UNG, USL &amp; SIVR

Last Thursday bought 100 VXX with a gain of $27.86 or 1.70% (which ended up a wash) And added to an existing USL position for a $20.86 gain or a 1.49% gain

Friday 200 VXX with a $98.64 loss or -2.68% (should have sold sooner and/or had stops - my bad)

Monday SIVR with a $9 loss

Thursday traded 175 SIVR with a $47 gain set a sell stop for $17.93 and adusted that up throughout the day to sell 3 mins below the closing bell (Odd note was in accupuncture when it climbed after intraday and visioned the stock going to $18.35 while I relaxed and saw it was at $18.40 when I could check it)

I am trying to use Schwab commission free ETF's if I can just to eliminate commissions in the beginning.

How can I improve and have more days like Thursday?
Pick better stocks with better volume?

* Closet indexers and their effect on average MF Performance
* Active Share 
* Fund size 
* Selection Alpha/Allocation Alpha Persistence
* Qualitative traits for great managers
* Different Ratios (sharpe, Treynor, Information)

I'm a government employee who's enrolled in a mandatory pension plan with a set contribution rate. The plan is seemingly great (if I stick around until retirement), but I want to invest in other ways too. My employer offers both 457(b) and 457(b) Roth plans, but there's no contribution matching. Being young and fine with having my contributions taxed now, I'm interested in either a 457(b) Roth or Roth IRA plan. 

Here's what I've gathered. Please correct any misunderstandings...

1. I can contribute more to a 457(b) (Roth or standard; 18k annually) than I can an IRA (5.5k annually).

2. 457(b) plans can have fees just like IRAs. I don't know the exact fees for the three vendors I can choose from (Fidelity, VOYA, and MNDCP).

16-07-02,4quvub,"If I had money left, I would massively short Valeant (VRX)","Let's face it: if someone was to come out with a buyout offer for that turd of a company, he would have done so already.

It's been almost a year now since Valeant's problems began to show up and the situation has not improved by an inch. On the contrary, problems seem to pile up and I am amongst those who believe Valeant's days are counted.

In simple words: valeant has too many problems.

Let's start with Hilary who might become president and has made a mission of attacking overpriced drugs. Yeah, not good for a company based almost exclusively on buying drugs then increasing the price by 5,000% or so. Of course, there's the crap accounting, up to the point where we have no idea what is going on behind the curtains. And then there's their weird distribution thing I won't even begin to discuss. All of this led to earnings being filed late and I believe this is just the tip of the iceberg.

Let's also not forget their massive $30B in debt. That makes sense for a company currently valued at $9B, right? Right??

Valeant is going to go bankrupt, there is no way to prevent it now. You'd have to be a fool to invest into it today as it is a typical value trap. On the contrary, I believe shorting Valeant to be an incredibly safe move. Let's face it: it went from $330 to $26. Look at BBD.B for another shitty canadian company if you need more evidence about how bad it can get.

Valeant will survive, but its shareholders won't. It will be the new Yellow media or something, current shareholders will get like 1 share of the new company for every 20 shares of Valeant they own. This creates a perfect shorting company. Even assuming Valeant survive, you are looking at an easy 50% profit here.

Fibonacci Retracement:

Downwards 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/BbMSW27c/

The dip went up above 50%. came down but did not pass 38%, wait, jumps to 62%. Indicating a good trend.



Upwards

https://www.tradingview.com/x/P7pdxJyG/

Dip did not go pass 38% and passing above 23%. Wait for confirmation of a bullish trend, sees it goes above original resistance. Indicating it will be going up.





Fibonacci Extension

16-07-02,4qx8m0,"Some observation on ARRY/AZN's Selumetinib (P3 trial results in NSCLC due in Q3)","Selumetinib was a much touted MEK inhibitor that was marred last year by a trial ""failure"" in uveal melanoma, as reported on sites like this: http://www.onclive.com/web-exclusives/selumetinib-misses-endpoint-in-phase-iii-uveal-melanoma-study#sthash.PfknxR4h.dpuf

However, since AstraZeneca never really put out a proper press release, I couldn't get my hands on the data to analyze what went wrong, so I had to do some digging.  This was a drug that showed a promising 100%+ improvement in PFS (from 7 to 15 weeks) during its 101-person P2 trials.  So, what went wrong?

Simply stated, they got screwed over by an improper trial design.  For a phase 3 study, they chose to recruit only 152 patients, barely larger than their P2 study: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01974752

Due to the small patient pool, they were unable to attain the p-value needed for statistical significance despite having a very strong statistical trend consistent with the p2 results.  In this video here, Dr. Richard Caravjal gives the final PFS data as 11w vs 7w (or 2.8m vs 1.8m), a 50%+ improvement in PFS.  The people in this study had metastatic disease, so while you may scoff at the 1 month improvement, it suggests clear effect and the potential to have much greater benefit for patients who are not as sick.  A common pitfall of the P2-to-P3 transition is that the patients recruited for the P3 tend to be sicker and harder to treat.  (There's a good discussion of this phenomenon here - ""patient selection bias"" http://seekingalpha.com/article/3985193-cytrxs-aldoxorubicin-phase-3-trial-high-ev-scenario)

http://www.onclive.com/onclive-tv/dr-richard-carvajal-on-selumetinib-dacarbazine-in-uveal-melanoma  (he gives PFS stats at the 1:15 mark)

50% improvement would be statistically significant in most phase 3 trials, but not one with only 152 patients.  Fortunately, the study that is due to announce results, the SELECT-1 NSCLC trials, has 500 patients, more than triple the size of the ""failed"" study.  This larger sample should easily pass statistical efficacy confidence thresholds and detect even a modest clinical benefit: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01933932

P2 results in the KRAS NSCLC indication can be found here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23200175

16-07-02,4qxdfw,Moving expensive managed mutual fund to Vanguard,"My wife and I have a Templeton World mutual fund (not in a tax sheltered account) and a Roth IRA handled by my father's money guy. Long story short, we are getting charged out the nose and don't feel like this guy necessarily has our best interests at heart, and would like to move to Vanguard. I've done quite a bit of reading including the Bogleheads guide and feel comfortable making a lot of these decisions myself now. 

I think moving the IRA should be fairly straightforward, but I'm trying to figure out the best way to cash out the mutual fund and buying something better at Vanguard. I'm hoping there is some way we can transfer the monies in the mutual fund to another Vanguard fund (ideally a Roth) and avoid having to cash out, for the purpose of taxes.

Today is the 2nd July 2016, all my calculations point to the next top in the SP500 to fall on the 7th July 2016, after this I expect the markets to decline. The next date to watch for a top is the 27th July 2016. If this top is lower than the top I expect to form on the 7th July , then this will point to a substantial decline in the value of stocks. I post this because  friend told me her pension dropped by 10% on the BREXIT. Anyone that is going to retire this year with an index linked pension needs to know that 2016 will be the year the stock market tops. December 2016 is going to see the markets crash around the world, stocks will decline by 50 to 60% at least. If you are invested in the stock market or you have friends or family that are going to retire this year please warn them that the crash is coming and to go into cash, before they get half their investment wiped out.

Please help me warn more people, by letting other people know and hitting the up arrow, I am really trying to help people before they get financially destroyed.

Here is a forward prediction I stated on a trading website

(you need to put the the www in here).forexfactory.com/news.php?do=news&amp;id=571983#post8664501
Here is what I said 

Dec 29, 2015 5:31pm

I will state here that the SP, DAX,DOW will all fall towards the end of December, the 30th of December would be the possible start of the fall. I expect the market to keep falling in January till about the 22nd, from here there should be a move up of a brief duration about 16 days, then the markets will fall again until Feb 15th-18th and if this occurs the markets will rally until April 6th or 8th possibly challenging or slightly exceeding their last all time highs.

I have made other posts where I have also called the top or bottom of the market to the day. My method is based upon the study of past cycle, ascertaining the cause of that cycle and then applying it to find the same cause in the future. Human behavior repeats, the market has a memory, and these cycels repeat into the future. som of my cycles go back over 50 years and they play out with an accuracy of plus minus 1 day. I am not always right but the fact I can do this suggests that the markets are not random and can be predicted into the future if you know where to start.

16-07-02,4qy40v,disturbing macro similarity to current conditions,"In late 1985 and early 1986, the United States economy began shifting from a rapidly growing recovery from the early 1980s recession to a slower growing expansion, which resulted in a brief ""soft landing"" period as the economy slowed and inflation dropped. The stock market advanced significantly, with the Dow peaking in August 1987 at 2,722 points, or 44% over the previous year's closing of 1,895 points. Further financial uncertainty may have resulted from the collapse of OPEC in early 1986, which led to crude oil price decreasing by more than 50% by mid-1986.[2]

On October 14, the DJIA dropped 95.46 points (3.8%) (a then record) to 2,412.70, and fell another 58 points (2.4%) the next day, down over 12% from the August 25 all-time high.

On Thursday, October 15, 1987, Iran hit the American-owned (and Liberian-flagged) supertanker, the Sungari, with a Silkworm missile off Kuwait's main Mina Al Ahmadi oil port. The next morning, Iran hit another ship, the U.S.-flagged MV Sea Isle City, with another Silkworm missile.

On Friday, October 16, when all the markets in London were unexpectedly closed due to the Great Storm of 1987, the DJIA fell 108.35 points (4.6%) to close at 2,246.74 on record volume. Then-Treasury Secretary James Baker stated concerns about the falling prices.

The crash began in Far Eastern markets the morning of October 19. Later that morning, two U.S. warships shelled an Iranian oil platform in the Persian Gulf in response to Iran's Silkworm missile attack on the Sea Isle City.[3][4]...

16-07-02,4qy76y,What % decline before the Fed starts to act again?,"Check out [this chart](https://www.thecapitalgroup.com/capitalideas/article/queue-up-for-more-qe.html), it's a simple and current chart of QE vs market movements.

IMHO, we are seeing the upswing in commodities largely because it looks like we're getting an answer to the question, ""will the market survive without the Fed (or other central bank interventions)?""

As of right now, it looks like the answer is ""no"". So, everyone assumes that banks are going to step in.

My question is - what kind of a decline do we have to see before more stimulus happens? Is there political will for it? 

My prediction: we will see another motion towards some other kind of stimulus if we have more negative macro data. But, I'm guessing we'll have to see another 10% off the markets for that to happen, I think Yellen wants to have a mandate to act. Also, that seems to be the standard number they use.

I'm guessing that by the end of the year we see a 10% decline and some dovish Fed members start making noise about further stimulus actions. I think we'll keep seeing commodities trade sideways/creep up slowly, then really taking off if further Fed action is discussed.",3

If you predict what will happen in the future accurately you should be able to make money.  The problem I have is a lack of time to research what the proper investments I should make to gamble on my predictions of the future.  I am referring to what is obvious to the professional investor.  The casual investor can't always connect those dots without a lot of research. For example, if I think Brexit will be a non-issue within the year - what should I invest in?  If I think the stock market will crash in the next 6 month?  Anyway always thought that would be a great idea for an investment site (or subreddit) and wanted to share.",8

With that being said, I am studying Business and Management at University, thus, I have a clear understanding on the Business perspective and terminology.

Now, the issuing itself does dilute the stock, but it also gives them more than enough capital to get by until FDA approval. When a stock is priced sub-penny because of near-bankruptcy, I think a $5mil cash injection dramatically increases their strength.

1 Brexit created future market uncertainty that has people worried. 

2 Brexit is currently wreaking havoc on currencies and gold &amp; silver are a safe haven

Gold and silver have been under valued for awhile imo. It should've been floating around 1300 all year.

16-07-03,4r0vgu,"If the Fed increases interest rates, isn't that subsidizing banks at the expense of other companies?","Investors of US banks are eargarly waiting for the Fed to increase interest rates which will boost earnings for US retail banks like $BAC, $WFC or $USB. This is because of a
widening spread: the amount of interest they pay to depositors is relatively
fixed while the interest they charge for loans will increase.

In parallel, non-bank companies will find it more expensive to raise debt and invest in value-creating projects which would decrease jobs and innovation overall. For example, Boeing or GE might open less factories or invest less in R&amp;D.

Banks will reap profits at the expense of value creating companies. Margins for banks are already sky high (ie. WFC has a 42% net margin). Why should this margin go even higher through government subsidization?

Why should the Fed raise rates at all? Isn't it a good thing for borrowing to be cheap rather than expensive? Why not just keep it close to zero?",3

I'm 18 right now, I work for Frontier Communications making $11/hour for 30-40 hours a week. Hopefully I'll see a small raise soon, if not, I will look for s slightly higher paying job after my first semester of college.  I really like where I work, but when my hours get cut back due to college, it won't be much income.  I live at home, so there's no rent yet. I'll be getting a new car in the next few months. I'm getting a salvage title Challenger and going to fix it up for &lt;$15K. My parents will give me a loan, so I'll have an expense of $200/month plus gas, possibly insurance. 

ANYWAY... I'm not a complete beginner to investing, but lately I got into penny stocks and learned why they're a horrible idea.  Now I would like into stocks that pay a decent dividend that I can hold and sell options on.  My goal is to buy 100 ATT stocks and sell weekly options, but that requires a lot of capital that I don't have.  What I'm thinking now is buy 200 or more FTR stocks and sell the monthly options. I would prefer a stock with weeklys, so I get more monthly income, but FTR only has monthly.  However, it has a big dividend.

I'd want to add to my position in blocks of 100 shares, probably once every 1-2 months, until I'm happy with my income. 

Can anyone critique my strategy or provide other good ideas or stocks that have weeklys and good dividends? I just want a little extra income in school.

Thank you all

tl;dr individual investors who trade the most frequently achieve worse performance than infrequent traders, probably due to overconfidence, high costs (commisions etc.) of frequent trading, and a tendency of selling winning stocks while hanging on to poor stocks.
  
Also interesting that after considering trading costs, even infrequent traders in this sample did not outperform the market. This also seems to be true for mutual funds, though to a lesser extent.",7

The S&amp;P just broke 2,100 for something like the 20th time. Every time after that, it fell towards 2,000 and sometimes under it. Do you really think this time is going to be different? Of course not.

I think we are about to witness one of the most epic and sustained fall in the S&amp;P we have ever seen. In fact, I am so sure a crash is coming that **if the S&amp;P500 doesn't crash by at least 2% tomorrow, I will officially turn insane.** This shows you how sure of myself I am.

The S&amp;P has been overvalued for ages now. With china dying, EU blowing up, QE stopping, rates being low for ages, it's rather clear that we are going to witness AT LEAST a 5-6% pullback this week, followed by the same decline for the rest of the month.

Buy 200 SPY puts today (or short the index).

But many companies were born because of it like zynga. Apple, has their dev kit for people to write apps. Microsoft also does too. Amazon also gives some things towards content creators.

Youtube can also be used as an example though they were acquired by google. But they still relied on the fact that people using them to publish videos. Reddit could also be an example. Neither of these are publicly traded though.

I started up a fresh demo on IG a couple of months ago just to test the waters, see if I could grasp the mass of data on the screen. After a little bit of fiddling around and a few awful trades, I got the concept.

Now heres my question, I've been trying stocks, and forex, and I can't find a consistent way of making profits without a lot of research into whatever I'm looking at. Until I came to binaries. Specifically binary 2 hourlies, basically gambling on wall Street prices at a certain time. 

Now I do realise there's poorer odds in binaries than forex, and I know they can be very unpredictable, but with a few rules I've consistently made a fair bit of money (imaginary as it may be). From what I can see, if wall Street is 50 points away from whatever my trade is with 5 minutes to close, chances are its probably not going to make that drastic of a change 9 times out of 10. And even then, if a see that drastic a change coming, I bet the other way to cover as much of the loss as I can.

So,low cost,good historical performance,good diversification(Even that 60 % of them are in USA),all stocks are re-investing dividends/income automatically(only bonds are redistributing income)
1)What do you think of the portfolio(Even that i am european,i have better trust in US economy,that in old Europe,so i decide to invest in US -so i invest 60 % in US(US small caps,S&amp;P 500,NASDAQ) and 40 % in the world(Global bonds and WorldMinumum Volatility)
2)Should I  pay a dividend tax(for stocks ETFs),because all of them are re-investing dividend/income automatically-is there a tax event ?
3)If i open my account in Euro and the ETFs are in USD,can i buy them automatically or first i should make a conversion of my currency(from euro to USD) ? 
4)If you have other feedback,suggestions,propositions.............i am glad to hear it.
P.S
I am not afraid of positive criticism,so use it bravely :)",4

# Description
Mohawk Industries, Inc. is a flooring manufacturer that creates products for residential and commercial spaces around the world. The Company's manufacturing and distribution processes provide carpet, rugs, ceramic tile, laminate, wood, stone, luxury vinyl tile (LVT) and vinyl flooring. Its trademarks include American Olean, Bigelow, Lees, Quick-Step and Unilin.

## Recent financials 

From their latest annual

&gt; These markets are influenced by many factors including consumer confidence, spending for durable goods, interest rates, availability of credit, turnover in housing and the overall strength of the economy. 

So sounds like this is a classic cyclical business with the economy being the key driver. The growth and margin expansion look pretty good too!

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $8.1bn | $7.8bn | $7.3bn | $5.8bn | $5.6bn|
|EPS | $8.31 | $7.25 | $5.07 | $3.61 | $2.52|
## Competition

From their latest SEC filing

&gt; The Company is the largest flooring manufacturer in a fragmented industry composed of a wide variety of companies from small privately held firms to large multinationals. In 2014, the U.S. floor covering industry reported $21.8 billion in sales, up approximately 5.6% over 2013's sales of $20.7 billion.

&gt; The principal methods of competition within the floor covering industry generally are service, style, quality, price, product innovation and technology. In each of the markets, price and market coverage are particularly important because there is limited differentiation among competing product lines.

Despite that commentary both margins and returns look healthy.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Mohawk Industries, Inc. | $8,362M | 18% | 16%
Ethan Allen Interiors Inc. | $782M | 13% | 14%
Interface, Inc. | $988M | 15% | 22%
La-Z-Boy Incorporated | $1,525M | 10% | 15%
Leggett &amp; Platt, Inc. | $3,889M | 16% | 31%
Select Comfort Corp. | $1,217M | 8% | 15%
Tempur Sealy International Inc | $3,133M | 12% | 40%

Mohawk Industries, Inc. has $3,151M of net debt. That is 2.1x it's latest operating profit.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $226.75 for Mohawk Industries, Inc. and their recommendation to clients is *Buy*. That implies an upside of 20% to their target.

# Valuation

The following table shows the key valuation metrics. The valuation is aggressive versus it's *Household Furnishings* peers. Though, I'm not sure I have the right peer group. If we look at a wider cyclical consumer group forecast PE is over 20 times with long-term growth expectations of 15%+ per annum. Could it be this is a ""boring business"" that is largely ignored?

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/mhk/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|

# Dividends
Mohawk Industries, Inc. is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. The firm appears to be happily doing deals, re-investing cashflow rather than paying dividends. In 2015 they did 3 big deals. 

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 0% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 2%. That's against a backdrop of revenues up 15% to $2.17B over the 3 months and reported net income up from $22.3M to $171.5M. Revenues were up for all 3 divisions: Flooring ROW; Flooring NA  and Ceramics.

In their [latest earnings call](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3972500-mohawk-industries-mhk-jeffrey-s-lorberbaum-q1-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single) they talked about their optimism, the benefits of the acquistions and the way their recent capital investments are bearing fruit. 

But they note that:

&gt; Each of our capital expansion projects creates significant long-term value, adding new revenues by increasing our product offerings and our customer base. Typically, these projects take one to three years to achieve their full benefit. All of these investments could provide higher returns than our acquisitions, though start-up costs impact our immediate results.

Perhaps these investments will provide a catalyst for earnings upgrades in the coming quarters? Alternatively could it be a stronger US economy and housebuilding market?

&gt; Similar to 2015, the U.S. economy had a soft start this year, but continues to benefit from solid job creation and low interest rates. Despite sluggish new home starts in March, the National Association of Home Builders affirmed the recovery of the U.S. single home family market.

For me, this is an intriguing stock! I think it merits a more detailed look.

Pricing the 210 weekly put expiring on the 22nd is 2.33 - gonna be higher since futures are off about 10 points from the afternoon close.  Ain't gonna pay that shit!  So, I priced the 212x215.5 call spread to sell brings it down to 1.3......basically at 208 or roughly 2080 on the spx i'm green.  I'm shitposting out loud here to flush out my thoughts and give the community their chance to DD this trade and tighten it up.  

Concerns - Who isn't looking for the next Brexit trade, now?  If the Brits had voted to stay, this bitch would be tasty AF!  But, everyone is expecting Trump to wipe his ass with the flag of the Frankfurt School and Critical Theory in general....ADD to that earnings season, which will be in full force.  But, how many earnings seasons have we had that hasn't produced a breakout?  

DISCLAIMER!
I am NOT looking for a one day type massive plunge like we got the other week.  I'm looking for a tape that basically has no bids.  Who is gonna make a big bet ahead of Trump being coronated?

Things to remember - FOMC meeting the following week. DNC convention is 25-28 - they will coincide.....how convenient.    

Which makes me think....I should probably play this for the monthly expiry...which is the friday before the convention starts.  

Conclusion - My bias is there is no fucking way we start a breakout in the indicies before a major political decision this fall.  The risk is central banks are already concerned about this and will support markets to convince the vox populi of sticking with the status quo.  In that case...GFM.... and buy the dec 230 call.

I am gonna trade this event.  Will look to open this trade this week on any strength.  Looking for a 1x10 payout structure.  Risk 1 to make 10.  

In conclusion.  I'm a fucking sociopath.  I will post sporadically to this thread.  I will change my mind, and maybe tell you about it.  I've had this idea in my head for a while now, and it's time to place it, but would love to see others fade this or enhance it....it's 11:30 pm and am about to short the /es because it feels like this trade is running away from me already.

http://imgur.com/FNcBPIB - Russell 2000..If things are so great why are small caps locked in a clear downtrend? Lower highs and lower lows. No new highs have been made in a year. Traditionally small-caps are used as leading indicators.

http://imgur.com/4wnQKCt - Bank Stocks...Nowhere even near the highs of last year and have lagged the February Rally heavily.

http://imgur.com/jTJaR3t - Biotech RISK ON....Not so much. Biotech and the NASDAQ in general have been some of the weakest performing sectors.

http://imgur.com/Kl4zvYM - Utilities! All aboard! Why are people investing in traditional safety and risk off plays? Not a bull market sign.

http://imgur.com/L0Y433Y - Go go Gadget Gold! Another traditional Safe Haven play. Signals Risk off.

http://imgur.com/nccolUI - Ahh TLT. The 10 and 30 year yields are scratching new all-time lows. Bonds don't lie.

http://imgur.com/3UDEQuC - And last but not least. Deustchebank. Recently named the most systemically dangerous bank in the world with about 72.8 Trillion dollars worth of derivatives on it's books. Trading lower than its 2008 lows. Something is amiss in Euro-bank land.

http://imgur.com/mV0D2uH - The purple line is the S&amp;P 500 and the regular chart is Dollar/Yen. A falling USD/JPY Ratio usually indicates risk off. When USD/JPY rises it usually signals risk on. Look how tightly correlated they were until recently. S&amp;P is going to have to play catch down.

(Yes, this includes inflation and re-invested dividends) (crosspost from /r/personalfinance)","I submitted this to /r/dataisbeautiful [some time last week](https://np.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/4q9iwa/40_years_of_investing_returns_in_the_sp500_with/) and it got some traction, so I wanted to post it here but with a more in-depth writeup.

Note that this data is from Robert Shiller's work. An up-to-date repository is kept [at this link](https://github.com/datasets/s-and-p-500/tree/master/data). Up next, I'll probably find some bond data and see if I can simulate a three-fund portfolio or something. But for now, enjoy some visuals based around the stock market:

**Image Gallery:**

* [Main image](https://i.redd.it/nn43lzu4d16x.png)
* [After 145 years (all data)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zonination/investing/master/returns.png)
* [Your chance of selling short](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zonination/investing/master/snippets/short-probability-2.png)
* [Animated](https://github.com/zonination/investing/blob/master/README.md#other-visualizations)

The plots above were generated based on past returns in the S&amp;P. So at Year 1, we take every point on the S&amp;P curve, look at every point on the S&amp;P that's one year ahead, add in dividends and subtract inflation, and record all points as a relative gain or loss for Year 1. Then we do the same thing for Year 2. Then Year 3. And so on, ad nauseum. The program took a couple hours to finish crunching all the numbers.

In short, for the plots above: **If you invest for X years, you have a distribution of Y possible returns**, based on previous history.

Some of the worst market downturns are also represented here, like the [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression), the [1970s recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973%E2%80%9374_stock_market_crash), [Black Monday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Monday_(1987\)), the [Dot-Com Bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble), the [2008 Financial Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308). But note how they completely recover to turn a profit after some more time in the market. Here's the list of years you can invest, and still be down. Take note that **some of these years cover the same eras**:

* **Down after 10 years** (11.8% chance historically)**:** 1908 1909 1910 1911 1912 1929 1930 1936 1937 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969 1970 1971 1972 1973 1998 1999 2000 2001
* **Down after 15 years** (4.73% chance historically)**:** 1905 1906 1907 1929 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969
* **Down after 20 years** (0.0664% chance historically)**:** 1901
* **Down after 25 years** (0% chance historically)**:** *none*

---

**Disclaimer:**

Note that this stock market simulation assumes a portfolio that is invested in 100% US Stocks. While a lot of the results show that 100% Stocks can generate an impressive return, **this is not an ideal portfolio.**

**[A portfolio should be diversified](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio)** with a good mix of US Stocks, International Stocks, and Bonds. This diversification helps to hedge against market swings, and will help the investor to optimize returns on their investment with lower risk than this visual demonstrates. This is especially true closer to retirement age.

In addition to this, this curve only looks at **one lump sum** of initial investing. A typical investor will not have the capital to employ a single lump sum as a basis for a long-term investment, and will instead rely on *dollar cost averaging*, where cash is deposited across multiple years (which helps to smooth out the curve as well).

Article Highlights (because, copyright)


- Standard Life has been forced to stop retail investors selling out of one of the UK’s largest property funds after **rapid cash outflows were sparked by fears over falling real estate values in the week after the UK’s vote to leave the EU.**

- **£2.9bn commercial property fund will need to sell real estate to raise cash.**

- **UK’s third largest open-ended property fund for retail investors.**

- The last property crash in the UK was preceded by a wave of similar gatings by funds struggling to meet investor demands for cash.

- Standard Life marked down the value of the buildings its funds own by 5 per cent in the wake of the Brexit vote. The UK’s two largest open-ended property funds did the same.

- impact could be wide-ranging since property has become one of the most popular choices for retail investors seeking yield in an era of low interest rates.

- **some closed-ended property trusts are trading at discounts of more than 10 per cent to their net asset value**

- **“The risk is this creates a vicious circle, and prompts more investors to dump property, until such time as sentiment stabilises.”**

- Investors in the fund will be unable to redeem for at least 28 days.

- Open-ended property funds have been criticised for the mismatch for promising investors daily liquidity despite property being an illiquid asset class

- During the financial crisis many investors were stuck in funds which had closed to redemptions as liquidity dried up

- open-ended fund redemptions will “drive capital values over the short term”, he said.",21

- They won't delist the trades.

- They are not going for a full interest, perhaps just a controlling interest.

Questions:

- If I decline the offer now, and they reach a majority position in the company, do I get a second chance to accept the offer?

- If they reach a +90% position in the company, what does this mean for my shares?

- If I cash in now for 115, can I decide to repurchase later on?

16-07-05,4rbz2w,Possible Blow Off Top On Commodity Silver,"The United States stock market may be closed, but commodities are still trading. What a session it was overnight with silver potentially putting in a blow off top. What is a blow off top? This term is used to describe the height of greed, where common sense and logic goes out the door and buyers rush in with reckless abandon. Almost always this is a near term top signal. In addition, this epic pop usually is caused in part by a short squeeze. A short squeeze is the term used when shorts panic and cover. Covering a short means they must by the commodity back, thus it increases net buying pressure.

Silver futures (September 2016 SIU6) spiked over the holiday session almost 10%. The commodity surged from $19.54 to a high of $21.21 before backing off to close at $20.41. Silver has been outpacing recent gains in all other commodities. From June 1st, 2016 to July 3rd, 2016, the commodity went from $15.83 to $21.21. This is a monthly whopping gain of 34%.

If the blow off top is correct, look for silver to retrace to a technical price target of $18.00 in the enxt week or two. This quick pull back usually follows a blow off top.",3

But the thread didn't include a lot of numbers. So hopefully this data ""overload"" helps.

## Retailers First:

Starting with sales, margins and returns, Amazon isn't an outlier. 

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Amazon.com, Inc. | $113,418M | 9% | 9%
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. | $483,208M | 7% | 19%
Home Depot Inc | $90,390M | 16% | 93%
Lowe's Companies, Inc. | $60,178M | 11% | 33%
Costco Wholesale Corporation | $117,937M | 4% | 21%
Target Corporation | $72,862M | 10% | 25%

Then valuation:

Companies |Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
AMZN | $342,396M | 135x | 49% | 0% | 2%
WMT | $226,923M | 17x | 2% | 3% | 13%
HD | $161,248M | 21x | 14% | 2% | 7%
LOW | $70,534M | 20x | 17% | 2% | 7%
COST | $68,386M | 29x | 9% | 1% | 6%
TGT | $41,279M | 14x | 9% | 3% | 16%

So it's clearly an outlier versus the retailers. Stating the *obvious* it's high valuation reflects a belief in its future growth prospects.

## Then to the top tech peers

Again, looking at sales, margins and returns, first. Amazon may have some of the highest sales figures, but margins and returns are clearly inferior.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Amazon.com, Inc. | $113,418M | 9% | 9%
Apple Inc. | $227,535M | 34% | 39%
Alphabet Inc | $77,988M | 33% | 14%
Microsoft Corporation | $86,886M | 34% | 13%
Facebook Inc | $19,766M | 47% | 11%
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd | $15,181M | 36% | 39%

Then valuation. Again, the high valuation reflects a view on growth. But it's even out of whack versus Facebook, the highest rated tech titan.

Companies |Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
AMZN | $342,396M | 135x | 49% | 0% | 2%
AAPL | $525,230M | 12x | 9% | 2% | 14%
GOOGL | $483,834M | 21x | 16% | 0% | 5%
MSFT | $402,142M | 19x | 9% | 3% | 7%
FB | $326,618M | 32x | 37% | 0% | 2%
BABA | $196,818M | 25x | 26% | 0% | 6%

## And media plays?

And if those comparisons don't work for you, how about that other darling, Netflix?

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Amazon.com, Inc. | $113,418M | 9% | 9%
Netflix, Inc. | $7,164M | 57% | 6%

and

Peers|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
AMZN | $342,396M | 135x | 49% | 0% | 2%
NFLX | $41,404M | 355x | 25% | 0% | 9%

The rights are currently held by our favorite pharma company, VRX. This is good for a few reasons. They can market it well since they're still a huge company although they're a dumpster fire currently. Also, if the oral version gets approved and sells well, they can see the rights off to pay down their debt. Even if they hold the rights, PGNX gets royalties and bonuses based on sales from VRX.

* 24.6% Chinese Yuan earning 2-3%. Better return than US banks, I like the cash position, I like the money out of the US financial system. Thesis is that they'll keep allowing it to strengthen vs the dollar. I expect this to return 5-8% over the long run, with little volatility.
* 13.2% S&amp;P500 Index Funds. Benchmark for everything else.
* 9% Wealthfront. Some overlap with my US stocks but they have me in a lot of things I wouldn't invest in otherwise. Bonds, energy, foreign etc.
* 6.4% Mutual funds focused on Thailand. My thesis when I bought them was the whole market was undervalued and that remains true. P/E's and dividend ratios are amazing relative to US stocks. 
* 6.4% Lending Club (LC). My largest individual stock position. I think it's dirt cheap right now after the CEO fiasco. 
* 5.67% Physical gold. I like the store of value outside of the financial system. I like the hedge. I don't have high hopes of this going up in value and if it does, everything else will probably be in bad shape.
* 5.15% AAPL. Dirt cheap. For the price of the stock you get a great price on current revenue streams and a free lottery ticket on future products and growth. 
* 5.05% GOOGL. Amazing company. Very fair price. Enough said.
* 4.12% Lending Club loans. Still paying over 10% after a few years but I'm not re-investing anymore. I don't like that it's not liquid. And still worried my long term return will be low, always hear stories about that.
* 3% YHOO. Sum of the parts math is still amazing. I like the exposure to BABA which I'd own otherwise and basically getting everything else free.
* 2.6% BRK.B. Warren Buffett does good against the S&amp;P500. When he dies, I have confidence they'll keep doing good.
* 1.9% Short Amaya (AYA). Company is a piece of shit, running their largest asset, PokerStars, into the ground. This is a bankruptcy waiting to happen, with all their debt. Only real risk I see is that somebody buys the company.
* 1.8% Barclays. Losing 50% of their value due to Brexit seems unwarranted. Financials look good, strong dividend. 
* 1.8% Vanguard Emerging Markets (VWO). Saw this recommended so many times I bought it. Non-correlated and all that.
* 1.6% Naspers. The market cap is their stake in Tencent. You get everything else (a lot) for free. 
* 1.6% Bitcoin and Ethereum. They have performed great. High risk but I think a really high reward. 
* 1.6% Short GoDaddy (GDDY). Similar story as Amaya, company is a huge piece of shit. Priced like a high growth tech company but I think the market has it wrong. They IPO'd very late in their life, they are a slow growth, mature company. One losing marketshare rapidly to AWS and others.
* 1.4% each: VGT, VYM: ETF fun
* 0.2% VUG more ETF fun
* 0.2% FB. token position. love the company but it's way too expensive right now. i'll add more when the valuation is more reasonable.",13

First off, I'm not sure this is the right sub for this question but I was hoping you guys could share your thoughts with me. The situation is as follows: in December I'll be moving from Amsterdam to London. As most of you know, London is really expensive and I'll be studying there so j won't make any money in the local currency. Most of my savings (around 10k) is in euros and I'll have to use it towards rent (around 1k GBP) and food. My tuition fees are already paid for. 

Seeing as the pound has dropped quite a bit in value, my 10k is already worth around 1,5 k more than a year ago. No one knows what's going to happen of course but do you think it'd be a good idea to change money into pounds already? Or is it likely that the pound is going to drop even more? What would you do in my situation?

However it seems that people are willing to pay any price for this stock, driving the yield down to a relatively measly 3.3%  It is extremely over bought based on RSI. If it were simply to return to it's historical dividend yield investors would see losses of &gt;20% which at this yield would be more than 5 years of dividends.

I realize that we are in a low yield environment, and relative to treasuries it might still look attractive.  I'm not sure that in 5 years that will be the case though. In my opinion low rates are coiling a spring that could lead to the next crisis. We assume this new paradigm of low interest rates will last forever, but eventually it will break. An increase of 100 or 200 bps in long term yields could cause massive losses with bond yields so low (or negative). I believe inflation will return 2 or 3%, not 10 or 12 and the US will lead the world kicking and screaming back to higher rates.

1. CDTI is debt free. This is rare for a micro cap stock.

2. CDTI will be profitable in the fourth quarter per their latest conference call. Extremely rare for a micro play.

3. Debt conversion is very attractive for the company, also very rare for a small cap. Usually debt conversion had be a horrible deal for small stocks.

So the trade would go something like this , depending on account size. Share quantities will be depending on the trade distribution of your portfolio. Like with all good trades, you still need risk management, so this trade plan will max out at 2%. That 2% will be divided over these entry points, all the way down to zero, so the most you'd lose is 2%.

# Description
Smith &amp; Wesson Holding Corporation is a manufacturer of firearms. The Company manufactures an array of handguns, including revolvers and pistols; long guns, including modern sporting rifles, bolt action rifles, and single shot rifles; handcuffs, and firearm-related products and accessories. 

## Recent financials 
|April-end|2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $773m | $552m | $627m | $588m | $412m|
|EPS | $1.68 | $0.90 | $1.49 | $1.18 | $0.25|

## Competition

When they talk about their competition they refer to:

&gt; The firearm industry is dominated by a small number of well-known companies. We encounter competition from both domestic and foreign manufacturers. Some competitors manufacture a wide variety of firearms as we do, while the majority of our competitors manufacture only certain types of firearms. We are one of the largest manufacturers of handguns, modern sporting rifles, and handcuffs in the United States and an active participant in the hunting rifle market. We compete primarily based upon innovation, quality, reliability, durability, price, performance, consumer brand awareness, and customer service and support. 

And when they talk about their performance they say:

&gt; our peer group consisting of stocks that participate in the shooting, defense, or outdoor market.

With that in mind...We can see that margins and returns are excellent for SWHC!

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Smith &amp; Wesson Holding Corp | $723M | 28% | 37%
Sturm, Ruger &amp; Company | $587M | 24% | 32%
Arctic Cat Inc | $633M | 1% | -ve
National Presto Industries Inc. | $413M | 17% | 13%
TASER International, Inc. | $209M | 16% | 11%
Vista Outdoor Inc | $2,271M | 15% | 9%

Furthermore, looking at the balance sheet, Smith &amp; Wesson Holding Corp has $17M of net cash. Nothing crazy, but nice all the same.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $29.00 for Smith &amp; Wesson Holding Corp and their recommendation to clients is *Buy*. That implies an upside of 4% to their target. So nothing exciting there.

# Valuation

The following table shows the key valuation metrics. It's valuation doesn't look aggressive and it's yield is reasonable. Though the lack of dividends looks strange. Surely this is a firm that could pay dividends?

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/swhc.o/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|

TASR.O | $1,309M | 88x | 30% | 0% | 1%
VSTO.K | $2,882M | 17x | 25% | 0% | 7%

# Dividends

Smith &amp; Wesson Holding Corp is not forecast to pay a dividend this year.

&gt; We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our preferred stock or our common stock. We currently plan to retain any earnings to finance the growth of our business rather than to pay cash dividends. 

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 22% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 12%. In the last year, revenues increased 31% with all divisions doing well.

Referring to guidance on their June [investor call](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3982585-smith-and-wesson-holding-swhc-james-debney-q4-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single) they suggested there would

&gt; we expect revenue for full year fiscal 2017 to be between $740 million and $760 million, with EPS of between $1.71 and $1.81 and non-GAAP EPS of between $1.83 and $1.93. 

So no topline growth, but reasonable bottom line growth. Why?

* firearm sales were very good in 2016, so 2017 could be challenging
* accessories market will still see solid growth
* they aren't forecasting any new firearms regulation that could lead to a spike in demand
* not factoring any acquisitions.

So maybe any of these 4 bullets being favorable would provide a boost?

16-07-06,4rj1mk,The purely American Bull Case for $SWHC,"This weekend I decided to celebrate the holiday at Lake Havasu with some buddies. After loading up my friends 2012 Toyota Corolla Sport with 6 racks of The Alcoholic Pisswater that they call Budweiser as well as two pairs of swimtrunks each and a VERY optimistic number of condoms; we departed from our humble apartment at Arizona State and prepared our livers for irresponsible drinking and possible skin cancer inducing sunburn. After a day on the lake and watching a lot of 18***(IDK) year old girls with shitty tattoos twerk we decided to take some of our American Firepower out to the desert to shoot some shit.

Within minutes of getting to the spot on the back of some Mexican guys Polaris Razr (If youre out there reading this, im fully convinced you are a cartel member so I hope you at least pay taxes here in America). I spotted a very ISIS looking jack rabbit. After sending a blazing hot .556 round out of my SWHC Ar-15 I could only pray that the ISIS rabbit would be hit.

Let me tell you I hit this guy and his face exploded into a red mist that played homage to the red on our flag. Instant death that was indicative of our napalm bombing of the Vietnamese in Laos. Red explosion that could only be compared to the eruption of Osama's kicked in face. That ISIS rabbit didn't stand a chance and the true power of my AR-15 invigorated my alcohol soaked body. 

The firework show that night only reminded me how great of a country America is and I almost felt thankful for the ISIS rabbit as it reminded me of our greatness. 

That all being said, I donated some  money to WWF and PETA as I felt like a shit bag today for killing an innocent rabbit in my drunken rage. My b rabbit fam. Also you should never shoot guns with alcohol, that shit was retarded. Also if a middle aged Mexican guy asks to go shooting with you, say yes. Also I didn't use any of the condoms.

Point of the story is, if my retarded and unskilled self could hit that rabbit from a mediocre distance when I could barely stand up straight, the SWHC AR-15 is a damn good gun. Buy all the stock you can. Lets ride this shit to the moon.

16-07-06,4rj2cb,Moderator Applications,"Hello /r/Investing community,

If you haven’t noticed we’ve brought on a few new mods. If you haven’t welcomed them already please welcome Donnie-Azoff, jperras, Fletch71011 and MasterCookSwag. These moderators have been brought on to expand the team to something more active and more knowledgeable, and to obviously *Make /r/Investing Great Again*. 

**However, an additional sticking point for us has been lack of active moderation over fairly basic “crap”. We have issues with adequately dealing with all of the issues outlined below:**

1)	Removing topics that should go into one of the “Advice” threads (Daily, Monday or Wednesday)

2)	Removing topics that are clearly promotional in nature (ie. Someone links to a shitty blog website, and apparently that is all the account does)

3)	Removing comments that are unarguably abusive, derogatory, cruel, or insulting (Rule 4)

4)	And finally, removing topics that are not discussable or not related to investing (think “brag” topics with zero analysis or information OR the 1,739,284th topic about Tesla without any information about how the stock price has been effected) 

At this time the modteam is currently NOT capable of moderating all of these issues. This is clear some days where the frontpage is clogged with crap and the community has complained about this more than once. 

**So, obviously we want more moderators.** So far our main focus has been bringing on people who want to bring change (think new good stuff, or great knowledge and history around here to help make decisions) to the subreddit. 

At this point we are willing to be much more relaxed about your professional background or depth of knowledge – activity on /r/Investing is a must but having some professional designation or resume is not needed (though a bonus)

**We want people who:**

* Read the four above issues and are, for some reason, excited about the opportunity to help clean it up

* Are willing to consistently dedicate some time to dealing with these issues. This means logging in at least once daily, having a look at /r/investing/new and the modqueue, and removing these topics and comments and leaving a removal reason. Maybe you don’t login some days, but you really try to make this a regular habit for you.
* Are active on Reddit and in this community  – one of the primary selection criteria will be activity on Reddit in general and activity on /r/Investing specifically 
* Are willing to pay attention to modmail and the moderator chat to help us discuss issues, decisions, and the subreddit in general
	
You can send in a quick application of interest by messaging the modteam. Please include a short overview about past volunteering with moderating online or your professional background, if applicable.

Thank you! 


P.S. I think a couple of people have submitted applications in very recent past regarding CSS help, or just helping out. If you all want to submit an application again - please go ahead. However I'm probably go to scroll back through modmail to find these applications again and include them in the pool. This post is just to get a ""full"" pool of applications.",4

16-07-06,4rhccx,Up 31% since January using Technical Analysis. Learn to trade the SPY,"**Hello traders**,

I am here to tell you how to make money using technicals. It's easy and it works. Technical Analysis takes 5 minutes per chart to predict where the price is going, as long as you remove your petty emotions you can trade successfully. How to trade using Technical Analysis.

**Technical Indicators**: Start with RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands. These are your most simple, and most effective indicators for you to begin trading with. Basically, buy when RSI is 30-50, short above 60. Buy when MACD line is above signal line, sell when it crosses below(Crossover). Buy when the stock is below the lower BB line, short when above top BB line. Simple. It's absolutely simple to use.

Use this website Investopedia for explanations of how different indicators work. 
http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp

After you master these basic indicators, begin following **volume**. When volume spikes, it usually spikes at the end of a trend(Whether uptrend or downtrend). Your technical indicators will show you a stock is overbought, and you'll see a volume spike to indicate the end of that trend. We would short here.

**Support and Resistance**: This one is the most import aspect of Technical Analysis. You need to know where support and resistance levels are. Once you find these levels, trade using them. Buy during uptrends. Short during reversals. You must always, at all times, know the support and resistance levels. I personally advise drawing a horizontal line from the last support/resistance (Use a free software, it doesn't matter)

http://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/061801.asp

**Learn it. Master it. And profit.**

**My trading strategy** involves trading only the SPY and the leveraging ETF's associated with it. You can go short, and go long by trading these ETF's. I personally advise using a trading software while you use Technical Analysis, free ones are okay like Yahoo Finance and Finviz, but I have a paid broker OptionsHouse for my charting.

SPXL - 3x SPY BULL

SPXS - 3x SPY BEAR

SSO - 2x SPY BULL

SDS - 2x SPY BEAR


For the haters, keep hating, I'll keep making money regardless. 

Technical Analysis is amazing. Learn it and you'll never regret it.

Leave a comment about how you pick your stocks, how you make your money or a particular stock you'd like technical analysis on. 

Cheers!

16-07-06,4rjo9f,This Mega Dual Rally Signals The End Of Central Banks And Epic Warning Shot,"Gold and silver have spiked dramatically higher in 2016. Just in the last week we have seen silver squeeze higher by 20%. It is extremely rare to see both gold and silver surging together. Why? The basics of it revolve around gold being a store of safety, while silver is mainly an industrial metal. The idea being, if there is panic gold surges but usually silver stalls or falls because the panic is due to something economic. Negative economic issues can hurt demand for silver.

 

This mega spike price action on gold and silver tells of something absolutely scary. It screams to the world that investors have lost all confidence in the central banks. Whether it is the Bank of England, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan or the Federal Reserve, currencies are looked at as being far too risky. Remember, interest rates in Japan and some places in Europe are now negative. It is not normal to pay a bank to hold your money. Central banks have created this artificially. Investors now prefer to hold gold, which is normal in fearful times...but also silver. That is the more shocking part. Central bank printing presses and monetary policy have gotten so out of control that investors are willing to buy anything but currencies. Look at the price of Bitcoin as well. It is up over 200% in 2016. Again, Bitcoin (BTC) is something the central banks around the globe have no power over. It cannot be printed at will.

 

Keep an eye on other metals to see if they start getting the same play. An even more economic dependent metal is Copper. If gold and silver continue higher, look to buy Copper. This could be the next store of safety from the out of control central banks. Pretty scary for investors if you hold lots of Dollars, Yen, Euro or Pound. Diversifying into other assets that cannot be printed is extremely important in this day and age.

 

The end game is simple yet horrifying. There will be another epic global collapse, far worse than the financial catastrophe in 2008-2009. It will spur a global depression. All of it caused by central bank policy. As the world emerges, the central banks will be dissolved. You read it here first. This will happen in the next 10 years.",10

16-07-06,4rjsnx,Swing trading $LABU and $LABD,"Hi. I would like to start strictly swing trading $LABU and $LABD. I am only 19 years old and have enough money saved up to deal with this volatility. (6k portfolio, have savings outside of that) So I have a few questions on how I should go about this.

Firstly, how do I follow/predict these stocks? I know they are 3x leveraged ETF following biotech, but not sure what that means as far as day-to-day research. Is there a radio station or website that actively talks about market moves in this sector? How could I predict which goes up and which goes down the next day?

As I understand, they are pretty much directly inverse, so I would take a big loss and big win everyday. With swing trading, I hope to invest big on down days and take my profits on green days. In my very amateur opinion, it looks like both these stocks have a resistance level of about $29 or something which is near the 52-week low. And I've noticed within a few days of this low, they bounce back up so I would like to take advantage of this. 

This stuff seems pretty obvious and kinda easy, so how can I do this properly?

If anyone else is interested in doing this with me, I would surely be happy to keep in touch every trading day to discuss the next move.

16-07-06,4rghbt,What are you guys doing for earnings season run up?,"Gambling on earnings is great fun it's true. For once I would like to have a plan in the works ahead of time and not just Yolo the day of. 

Right now my only semi earnings play is I'm holding AMD $5 puts expiring in August. 

I'll sell some or all of them before ER if good old AMD takes a dive pre earnings. I figure if AMD makes a big move upwards at least I can hold through ER and possibly recover some gains. 

I was hoping AAPL would run to $100 again so I could get puts on it. My guess is IPhone sales will be down again and AAPL will have a tough ER.

16-07-06,4rk1hw,Are you allowed to exercise a put option with stock you already owned before buying the option?,"I am just learning about options and was wondering if this kind of scenario is valid:

Say I bought stock 'X' at $50 last week. Today, 'X' is worth $150. Then today, I buy a (European) put option for 'X' that costs $74 on a strike price of $200 with an expiration date of next week. Next week comes around, and the price of 'X' has dropped to $125. 

From what I've read, in this position, I would immediately buy 'X' for $125 and sell it for $200 with my put option, and make a net profit of $1 (due to the option price being $74). But am I required to purchase 'X' for $125, or am I allowed to not buy anything and just sell what stock I already have (when I bought 'X' at $50) for $200?

- Apple computers lost competition with Windows PC and are merely toys for Instagram hipsters,
- Apple have many problems with management and Tim Cook scares investors.

On the other hand, this a great opportunity to short APPL. It lost 24% already in last 12 months and in long run it might share the fate of Nokia, being outplayed by Korean and Chinese phone manufacturers - HTC, Xiaomi, Samsung (already most popular brand worldwide).",0

I am very confused after having been reading this sub for a while. 
I am fully aware that it's easy to lose a lot of money doing what you guys are doing, but from what I see here it would seem you should never count on getting any money from investing in stocks, as it's more likely you'll lose it then earn it.

I'm sure this is true when we're talking about unexperienced investors, but what about people who actually put an effort into it?


I'm just having a hard time getting my head around why so many people invest in stocks if at the same time they say they lose all the time.

I was under the impression that it was risky (of course), but could prove quite lucrative **provided one does a lot of research** and doesn't just **blindly gamble**. Basically, I thought it was considered more of a side job, than some random hobby.


Was I wrong?

Or maybe most people treat stocks market like a casino instead of trying to make educated guesses and rational choices and that's where all this advice is coming from?

Could someone please clear this up for me?

For Selling Now:

- Near 52 week high
- Background checks data released caused a big jump in the stock recently, without further positive news the stock will probably go down

For Not Selling Now:

- Fears of a Clinton Presidency may drive the gun sales and thus the stock *sky high* through campaign season and beyond

What do you guys think?

About the challenge:  
I recently gained access to a stock trading service called Robinhood which allows users to make free stock trades with $0 transaction fees. To take advantage of this benefit, I’m starting this “$26k Challenge” thread with the following premise:
  
I’ll swing trade different stocks, my goal is 30K by the end of summer
Each day, I’ll report here with an update on my picks and overall portfolio progress
I’m hoping this will spark some interesting conversation about Robinhood, about my specific stock picks, general investment strategy, hot topics such as high frequency trading, etc… I’m making this public because I think it will be fun for people to follow along. Please don’t take my updates as advice or suggestions: I’m not a professional investor and this is just an experience for me.
  
The vast majority of investing professionals would tell you to invest for the long haul and that timing the market and riding the ups and downs is a coin toss at best, unless you’ve got millions of dollars at your disposal. I agree and it’s a strategy to which I largely subscribe. The $0 transaction fees offered by Robinhood do somewhat reduce the barriers that potential low volume day traders face, but I’m not suggesting it’s a strategy you use yourself. Again, I’m doing this for fun.
  
I may update this first post with more information depending on the interest/response… but here goes nothing.

16-07-06,4rkwo6,Some DD on $FIZZ (Earnings in a Week),"So FIZZ is a small (compared to $KO &amp; $PEP) beverage company. They make a bunch of crap you've never heard of ... but they also make La Croix. La Croix is flavored, bubbly water–and basically the hottest drink going right now. Think of it as the ""Lululemon of Soft Drinks"". Every millennial and quasi-healthy-yoga-doing-career-woman is drinking them. I went into my Target the other day and La Croix 12-packs were flying off the end cap. People are even making cocktails out of this shit. 

The stock has been a rocket ship the last year. Its basically at its 52-week high right now. *Can it keep going up?* That's the big question. Personally, I think this is more than just a fad and it has room to keep going–plus, why wouldn't Coke or Pepsi jump on this bitch and buy it out? 

*Here's some data points for you to consider:*

• In the last 2 years, soda purchases are down but sparkling water sales are up

• They don't even do any advertising–its like this hidden, secret drink for cool kids. Imagine if they did!

• Their market cap is $2.88B. Coke paid over $4B for Vitamin Water. Buying FIZZ for a premium would be a rounding error for Coke or Pepsi. 

• Philadelphia just passed a soda tax and San Francisco is considering a soda warning label law. Soda is the new tobacco and the dominoes could really start falling with taxes and warnings on sugar water. 

• 27% earnings growth (yoy)

• No debt 

*On the negative side:*

• Its not exactly hard for another company to make a copycat product

• P/E of 52 is pretty high compared to competitors/industry

• Its at its 52 week high, so maybe it has peaked 


Anyway, maybe one of you TA dorks can provide some insight on that front (I can't). Earnings are in 7-10 days ... time to buy high and sell higher boys!",31

# Description
General Motors Company designs, builds and sells cars, trucks, crossovers and automobile parts. Brands include: Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, Holden, Opel and Vauxhall. GM's Financial arm provides retail lending, both loan and lease, across the credit spectrum.

## Recent financials 

Sales aren't going anywhere recently, despite the global economic recovery, though earnings have recovered and GM is now paying dividends again!

## Competition

From the latest SEC filing:

&gt; We operate in a very competitive industry with market participants routinely introducing new and improved vehicle models designed to meet rapidly evolving consumer expectations. Producing new and improved vehicle models competitively and preserving our reputation for designing, building and selling high quality cars and trucks is critical to our long-term profitability. We will launch a substantial number of new vehicles in 2016. Successful launches of our new vehicles are critical to our short-term profitability. In addition, our growth strategies require us to make significant investment in our brands to appeal to new markets.

Furthermore, they point out that it can take 2 years to launch a new vehicle and that they are a very fixed cost business. 

Margins and returns are good versus most of the peers, though perhaps there is a chance to get to Toyota or Volkswagen's long term?

General Motors Company has $49,718M of net debt. That is 2.9x it's latest operating profit. Typically I would worry when a company's debt gets that high... but this is the auto industry and I sometimes wonder if this industry is more a bank that gives cars away to attract borrowers, than a car company that lends to its clients... here's a subset of the group, just look at the size of the borrowings versus the market value. Wow!

General Motors Company | $43bn | $50bn | 2.9x
Ford Motor Company | $49bn | $125bn | 9.3x
Toyota Motor Corp (ADR) | $168bn | $131bn | 3.0x

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $37.06 for General Motors Company and their recommendation to clients is *Buy*. That implies an upside of 32% to their target.

# Valuation
The following table shows the key valuation metrics. Valuations are tiny, though I am suspicious of the long-term growth forecasts from Wall Street. And of all the majors the Free cashflow looks attractive.

But I can't help to recall a *maxim* that you sell autos when they are *cheap* and buy them when they are *expensive* as usually they are cheap at peak earnings and the top of the economic cycle. :(

VLKAY.PK | $64,071M | 6x | N/A | 11% | 17%

# Dividends
General Motors Company is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.48 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $1.38 per share. That is a 7% growth. Nice! And it's still looks like there is room, given forecast EPS of $5.64 a share.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -6% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 3%. So it's valuation's under pressure. That's despite sales in the last 3 months up 4%, with the US performing well, and the Financial division too.

I fear the drivers in the near term are going to be, the obvious ones: 
* US auto sales
* global economic outlook
* the dollar
* interest rates

So, maybe I just buy it, take the 5% yield and ignore the fluctuations, assuming they'll survive the electric car onslaught from Tesla and friends.

Or would you suggest a different auto stock?

16-07-06,4rivrw,The iphone 7 is rumored to be very similar to the 6/6S line. Time to say goodbye to Apple till the iphone 8?,"In case you haven't heard, the iphone 7 will look very similar to the iphone 6 and 6S. This is unusual because when the iphone increments to a new number, it usually gets a new design. 

And for the internals, aside from the standard upgrade in CPU and camera power, there is also very little that is expected to be different. One of the only notable changes, the removal of the headphone jack, will probably annoy as many people as it intrigues. 

Apple's reply has been that the features they wanted were not ready in time and so they are putting everything into the 10-year anniversary iphone, which will come out in 2017 and be called the iphone 8(the iphone 7S will be skipped).

Apple has been in a bad spot over the last 18 months and many had been hoping the release of the iphone 7 would put an end, at least temporarily, to its lackluster performance.  

But if these rumors hold true, then it seems that not only will the iphone 7 not improve Apple's performance, but it may actually detract and slow it down even more, as people shelve their iphone 7 purchase/upgrade plans upon seeing how similar it is to the iphone 6/6S and hearing about the big upgrades coming to the iphone 8. 

Because Apple will have to explain the lack of innovation. They won't be able to say ""the only thing that's changed is everything"" this time. ",0

16-07-07,4rmapp,Observation about price on option chain.,"TLDR --- You need to think in terms of ROI when looking at price difference between two options.

On OptionHouse I'm seeing the following pricing for calls.

* Please read on only if you have never thought about why you're choosing to buy one call rather than another.

2090C -&gt; $21.2

2100C -&gt; $15.10

For 90C, the breakeven point for is spx of 2111.2.
For 00C, the breakeven point for is spx of 2115.1.

The following ranges are relevant when determining between the two calls. Let's look at whether you'd do better buying the 90C or the 00C in these cases.

1) If SPX ends up below 2090, both ""investments"" are worth 0. No difference. [ You should have bought puts instead. ]

2) When SPX is between 2090 and 2100, you will get some money back for the 2090C, but the 2100C will be worthless. [ 90C is better. ]

3) At the price of 2111.2 is when the 90C makes up the fee. At this price point, the 00C is still losing you money. [ 90C is better. ]

4) Between 2111.2 and 2115.1, the 00C is still losing you money or just covering up the fee. Where the 90C is making you money for every dollar above the 2111.2 point. [ 90C is better ]

5) And finally, when SPX gets above 2115.1, is when both options starts making you money. Let's take a closer look at this.

Say SPX is at price P, where P &gt; 2115.1. 

For option on every share, you make (P - 2115.1) for the 2100C, and (P - 2111.2) for the 2090C. At first blush, it may seem like the 2090C is still better, b/c you get more profit per share. But you need to take into account of the price you paid for the options. So instead of profit per share. Lets look at return on investment. This is what you care about the most. Because the question you want answer to is, I have $10K, how do I get the most cash from these $10K.

The ROI on the 2010C is (P - 2115.1) / 15.1, and the other is (P - 2111.2) / 21.2. 
*Note the significance of the denominator, it's saying that even though you're making less profit per share for the 2100C, you also paid less in fees for the right to make that money per share.

These are two straight lines that must intersect at one point and diverge. Let's look at the of of the difference between the ROIs of the two calls.

https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+100+*+((x+-+2115.1)+%2F+15.1+-+(x+-+2111.2)+%2F+21.2),+x+from+2100+to+2300

Note the x-intercept at 2124.75. This is saying that it is only when the stock goes to this point that the 2090C start giving you better ROI. Note also that 2124.75 represents about a 1.2% increase in the index. Which I guess is not that much.

Below is the plot of both lines.

https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=calculate+100+*+(x+-+2115.1)+%2F+15.1+and+100+*+(x+-+2111.2)+%2F+21.2,+x+from+2100+to+2200

In particular, when SPX is at 2200, the 90C offers a ROI of about 419% where 00C has a ROI of 562%.

Well, there you have it. The only time when the 00C is better than the 90C is when P is above 2124. Which means, when you buy the 00C instead of the 90C, you're literally saying you expect the SPX to be above 2124.

16-07-07,4rmb6h,Semi-DD of th Steel Industry (x-post from WS-DD),"Sorry for writing a book. But this only part one of many if it is well liked or wanted. TLDR; Steel is complicated.

As a lurker of many subs I should not complain, but I will try do my part on this sub to help inform this sub on the steel industry. This is all speculation.

My Background: I graduated with BS in Business with focuses in management and marketing. Upon graduation I started working for one of the World's largest Steel Processors (SP'S)

Major Players in the Industry in no order: Suppliers North America

$X United States Steel- Currently trading at $17.95

$ADR Arcelormittal- Currently trading at $4.69

$NUE Nucor Corporation-Currently trading at $51.08

These are the 3 biggest suppliers in America. They are all inherently different in their own ways.

$X- United States Steel is a heavily unionized steel mill. They were founded in the early 20th century and has since been a staple in the industry. Their largest facility is Gary Works in Gary, Indiana. I live about 15 minutes from this facility. They were strongly affected by imported steel from China, South Korea, and Turkey after the Chinese economy slowed down. China started importing steel at ridiculously low prices. This negatively affected the North American steel industry including my own facility. USS is considered an integrated mill as they have all the functions to produce steel, meaning they produce steel from raw form. I can go over how steel is made if anyone cares to know.

Side Bar: I will answer all and any questions concerning the importation of steel to the best of my ability. I have directly and indirectly handled foreign steel. In the past, it was not a concern, as the quality of steel from Non-North American facilities was considered of less quality.

$ADR- Arcelor Mittal is a multinational steel producer. It was formed in 2005 and is the world’s largest producer of steel. There are two major facilities within 20 minutes of my home. They basically bought up many facilities after the steel market collapsed in 2008 along with housing. As of December of 2013 they employed over a quarter of a million persons. In my area, they are also largely unionized. They are considered an integrated mill.

$NUE-Nucor Corporation is the largest mini-mill steel producer. The biggest difference between this company and the two above is that they are a mini-mill. Meaning they use electric arc furnaces to melt scrap steel as opposed to blast furnaces to melt iron. The biggest downfall of mini-mill material is that it comes with certain impurities that some customers do not prefer.
If you look at the stock prices of each company and wonder why each is trading at different levels although all being the biggest suppliers in North America I will explain below. Reasoning: (Simple in my opinion)

$X- USS is trading at the number 2 spot for the simple reason that there was a tariff of more than 500% on all material entering the United States and because USS is mostly in the United States it has proven to be a positive impact to their stock.

$ADR-Arcelormittal is trading at is price because of the globalization of the company. They are only affected by a worldly event in my opinion. Their foot print is massive.

$NUE- Goes back to how they make steel. When China, South Korea, and Turkey was importing massive amounts of steel into the United States, the price of steel dropped with it so did the price of scrap. The price of scrap dropped much lower, meaning that NUE was able to produce steel at a lower price than X and ADR. Catalysts for the steel market to watch for in no order however price of steel is often the most important factor.
 1. Price of Steel
 2. Car Sales 
3. Price of Oil 
4. Housing Market

I will end this post here and answer all questions to the best of my ability. If there is a positive reaction to this post I will post a follow up with steel processors to give an informative view. 

Top SP’s below for those who are curious. I work for one of these. There is a reason this list is much larger than steel makers above.

Russel Metals
Samuel, Son &amp; CO., LTD.

I want to ask a quick question about stocks.

Here's an example, INTEL : http://www.investing.com/equities/intel-corp-chart

May 4 is the ex-dividend ($0.26 per share) and jun 1 is the payment date for dividend, which means if I open a short position before the dividends is announced (ex-dividend date is the announcement date, right?), my obligation would be to pay the dividends to the real shareholder -since I borrowed his stocks-, which makes shorting stocks and CFDs make dangerous albeit it's also advantageous while you're right.

Have I got this right?

Is there a way to guess when a company gives a dividend so I can stay away from shorting those stocks?

I am a 31 yr old software engineer with IBM. I have the option to invest up to 10% of my salary in IBM stock, purchased at a 5% discount with the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. 

Alternatively, I could just move that money from my personal bank account into something like the Robinhood mobile app and invest in Blue-Chip stocks(Apple, Google, Citi, etc...). 

I dont have the upfront minimum balance to go the more traditional fund route so I'm looking at the lower barrier of entry methods. I have a wife and kids, and the normal debt that goes along with that, 2 cars, rent, etc...

The overall goal is to save money in the long term and not become rich off the stock market. I dont have the delusions of grander, I just want something saved so down the road I have the rainy day fund and/or retirement. 

I would only be investing about 5% of my pay instead of the whole 10% because that is just what we have budgeted. I would just be curious on everyones take; IBM Employee Stock Program, or another avenue of approach?

Thanks!

 Edit to answer a couple things:

1) you cannot sell immediately. The plan periods are 6 months, Jan 1 - Jun 30 and July 1-Dec31. All shares bought in that period can be sold as soon as that period closes. 

2) no look back 

3) the stock is purchased with each pay period. 1st and 15th of the month. If you can afford a full share with your contribution, you purchase a partial share. 

4) I do not know what the sale commission is. I would have to go looking through all the documentation more. ",5

# Description
The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (Boston Beer) is a craft brewer in the United States. Brands include Samuel Adams, Twisted Tea and Angry Orchard. The Company’s beers are primarily positioned in the Better Beer category of the beer industry, which includes craft (small, independent and traditional) brewers, domestic specialty beers and most imports. Better Beers are determined by higher price, quality, image and taste, as compared with regular domestic beers.

Sales and profitability have had a nice trajectory over the last 5 years.

## Recent financials 
|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $1,024m | $966m | $794m | $629m | $558m|
|EPS | $7.25 | $6.69 | $5.18 | $4.39 | $4.81|

That is despite a tough *beer* market, as the outline in their latest SEC filing

&gt; The domestic beer industry, excluding Better Beers, has experienced a decline in shipment volume over the last ten years. The Company believes that this decline is due to declining alcohol consumption per person in the population, drinkers trading up to drink high quality, more flavorful beers and increased competition from wine and spirits companies.

## Competition

Competition is intense, again from the filing

&gt; The Better Beer category within the United States beer market is highly competitive due to the increasing number of craft brewers, imported beers with similar pricing and target drinkers, and efforts by large domestic brewers to enter this category. The Company estimates there are over 5,000 craft breweries in operation or in the planning stages, up from approximately 1,409 operating craft breweries in 2006. 

Though if we look at the financials both the operating profit and returns are inline with the big brewers, though brewers are less profitable that wine &amp; spirit companies.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Boston Beer Co Inc | $949M | 20% | 20%
Anheuser Busch Inbev SA (ADR) | $42,551M | 38% | 18%
Compania Cervecerias Unidas S.A. (ADR) | $2,177M | 19% | 11%
Craft Brew Alliance Inc | $202M | 5% | 0%
Heineken N.V. (ADR) | $22,765M | 21% | 15%
Kirin Holdings Co Ltd (ADR) | $21,375M | 11% | -ve
Molson Coors Brewing Company | $3,525M | 22% | 5%
Brown-Forman Corporation | $3,091M | 36% | 62%
Constellation Brands, Inc. | $6,789M | 33% | 18%
Diageo plc (ADR) | $13,600M | 33% | 32%

Boston Beer Co Inc has $50M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 2% of the market value of Boston Beer Co Inc. So nothing to worry about on the balance sheet, as far as I can tell.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $156.00 for Boston Beer Co Inc and their recommendation to clients is *Hold*. That implies a downside of -8% to their target. It seems that he high valuation at 25x forecast earnings and is weighing on Wall Street :( or it could be that earnings this year are forecast to be down v. 2015.

# Valuation

The following table shows the key valuation metrics. Valuation doesn't look as stretched as at $BREW but it is still strange to see a valuation in the 20s for a business that isn't expected to grow much. Though admittedly the entire sector looks richly valued, distillers and wine included.

DEO | $70,280M | 17x | 4% | 3% | 8%

# Dividends

Boston Beer Co Inc is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. And sadly:

&gt; Since its inception, the Company has not paid dividends and does not currently anticipate paying dividends on its Class A or Class B Common Stock in the foreseeable future. 

The company prefers to do stock repurchases instead. Theoretically the same  as dividends of course!

&gt; On February 10, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company increased the aggregate expenditure limit for the Company’s Stock Repurchase Program by $50.0 million, thereby increasing the limit from $525.0 million to $575.0 million. As of December 26, 2015, the Company has repurchased a cumulative total of approximately 11.5 million shares of its Class A Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $446.1 million.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -3% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -14%. That's against a backdrop of sales down 5% in the last 3 months.

Yes competition is up, but they have a great distribution network, have invested heavily in the last 3 years, which is now starting to pay off, and they are launching new products that could see growth pick up. 

Maybe it's not frothy at these levels? Even if Wall Street isn't a fan.

After the recent explosion of [Tesaro Inc.](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3ATSRO&amp;ei=kHdzV4HkMueyiQKt4pbgCQ) due to encouraging phase 3 clinical trials or their drug Niraparib, the hype continues to grow in the industry.


Then there is Medivation’s drug, Talazoparib. The company claims their drug is the best in the class of competition and has declined multiple offers in what looks to be shaping up as a bidding war for their drug. They had an encouraging conference call today and are pointing at data and claiming that their drug is 50x more effective than Tesaro's recent blockbuster. Clinical results are also expected before their anticipated date.


And then there is Clovis Oncology and their drug Rucaparib. If you compare the results of both Phase 2 results: Rucaparib vs. Niraparib....You'll see Rucaparib has better results. I know this not an indication of how good Rucaparib phase 3 results are going to be, but if this trend continues, Rucarparib will be superior to Niraparib. Plus, Rucaparib's RUCAPANC trials for Pancreatic Cancer look promising as well. FDA approval or FDA NDA acceptance of (Ariel-Ovarian cancer treatment) along with positive Phase 3 trials will send this stock on a rocket ship to the moon. With every positive news and positive press release from the PARP Inhibitor group, Clovis has seen the benefits.


Expect similar benefits tomorrow and in coming weeks-months as the value of Medivation’s drug, Talazoparib increases and preps for an acquisition. If clinical results are as good as they are hinting at, and since we've already seen the results of Tesaro's drug, Clovis will more than likely see the same or they will literally crash and burn. Of all the competing drug companies in the PARP bubble, Clovis is undoubtedly the most undervalued and possessing the most upside. ",15

I have dividend option selected to not be reinvested and going directly to the money market account.

My thought was because you cannot buy fractional shares of an ETF like you can with a mutual fund that bad things would happen and the money would just kind of vanish forever or lay in limbo since it would take years to own enough shares of voo to generate 180 in dividends to buy another share of voo

So
My stupid question is am i incorrect on this?

Can dividends actually be reinvested into an ETF when the dollar amount generated is not sufficint enough to buy a share or does ""reinvesting dividends"" occur in some other mechanics that im not grasping?

They claim to use a proprietary research platform called ATLAS, but there's not a lot of info available on how ATLAS works or compares to other platforms. 

Their chief candidate (in phase 2b trials) right now is a drug called GEN-003, a vaccine aimed at decreasing the severity and viral transmission rate of genital herpes. They are working on some cancer stuff as well, but it's all smoke at the moment. Two things are exciting about GEN-003, should it be a viable therapy:

1) Their drug has so far shown comparable results to daily oral medication (i.e. valtrex), but GEN-003 is an annual injection.

2) If GEN-003 is successful, it will be one of the first-ever T-cell vaccines for an infectious disease. Some T-cell therapies are used to treat leukemia/lymphoma, but as far as I know, this would be one of the first commercially available T-Cell therapies for something other than cancer. 

The latter point especially makes GNCA a prime buyout target if GEN-003 is successful. Remember the ATLAS thing? If they've successfully used it to create a widely-applicable T-cell vaccine, a large company will want that technology. 

#Gen-003
Here's where we're at so far. 

In 2012, [Phase 1 trials](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01667341?term=gen-003&amp;rank=3) established that the concept would probably work and was safe. 

In 2014 they started the first part of [Phase 2](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02114060?term=gen-003&amp;rank=2) trials, using 6 different formulations of the vaccine to see which one worked the best. 

In 2015 they started [Phase 2b](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02515175?term=gen-003&amp;rank=4), a closer look at the 2 best-performing formulations.

**The Good**

In March this year, GNCA announced that they had positive 12-month efficacy results for their drug. The presentation is [here](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AMDA-2GAAWE/2377417216x0x883623/37F3C69F-B332-4CCB-9375-557CE1436162/GEN-003-002_12_month_Results_FINAL.pdf). This is big, though -- positive 12-month efficacy will probably be their phase 3 endpoint and determinant of drug approval. Hitting it here means that the NDA is pretty likely to be approved. 

The next step for Gen-003 is the phase 2b trial ([ongoing](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02515175?term=gen-003&amp;rank=4)), which is comparing the two most promising formulations of the drug. GNCA estimates that they will meet with the FDA in Q1 of 2017 to discuss the end of the phase 2 period. Given the strong results in Phase 2, if the drug passes phase 2, a phase 3 go seems extremely likely. 


**The Bad**

Their research seems pretty solid, on the whole, but there are two problems so far. First, they rolled the placebo group into a testing group after the drug administration and first datapoint (on day 28 of the trial). Basically they confirmed that there was a significant difference with the drug and no change for the placebo group, then rolled the placebo group. Given that the rest of the trial was just following up to make sure the results stuck around, this isn't *terrible*, but it's not great. I don't know why they rolled the placebo group. Potential explanations include a need for more test participants and a desire to give the patients access to the real thing after the first datapoints showed a statistically significant difference between the drug and the placebo. 

Second, in every trial far, GEN-003 has outperformed the placebo in viral shedding, but **matched** the placebo in actual lesion outbreak [\[results album\]](http://imgur.com/a/OaOS1) Potential explanations: a) viral shedding is determined in a lab, but lesion outbreak is patient-reported. It's possible that there are some reporting issues there. b) placebo effect can decrease lesion outbreak (external symptom and immune mediated) but not viral shedding (asymptomatic, less immune mediated).

**Summary**

Although I'm not thrilled about the lesion thing, even if the drug only decreases viral load it could still be considered a success, as viral shedding is necessary for herpes transmission. The company itself seems to have a very positive outlook on GEN-003's chances, and if you're looking for a biotech that might deliver some spikes in the near term (expect a spike in Q1 2017 if Phase 2 is completed successfully) with good potential for longer term (6mos - 2yrs), GNCA is a good target.

16-07-07,4rpln6,Article on CAPE ratios and forecasting,"http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/faj.v72.n3.1

There's been talk of overpriced equities non-stop, any many of those times people will point to CAPE and point out how it's higher than usual.  But here's an article from not too long ago touching on CAPE and it's potential downsides.

Some Key Takeaways:

1.) The CAPE Shiller Ratio is based on GAAP earnings.  The definition of GAAP earnings changed significantly in 1993 and again in 2001.  Thus there is an inconsistency when comparing the current trailing 10 year CAPE ratio to earlier decades.

1a) . These new accounting principles lead to an aggregation bias.  For example in Q4 2008 AIG made up 0.2% of the S&amp;P 500 but the new rules required it to write down book values which led to a reported loss of $63 billion in the quarter.  This wiped out all earnings from the 30 most profitable companies in the S&amp;P 500 whose values made up more than half of the index.

2.) From 1928 to present the Bureau of Economic Analysis has compiled National Income and Product accounts (NIPA).  NIPA has been compiled in a consistent manner from 1928 to present.

3.) The study finds that using NIPA instead of GAAP earnings has produced a higher R squared (40.09% versus 34.98%).  Thus substituting NIPA for GAAP earnings leads to higher predictive value from 1928-2014. 

3a.) While the recent CAPE Shiller using GAAP predicts a 2.81% plus inflation return over the next ten years the more reliable NIPA CAPE predicts a 5.25% return plus inflation. 

3b.) Assuming 3% inflation the GAAP CAPE predicts a 5.81% over the next ten years versus 8.25% predicted using the more consistent and reliable NIPA input.  8.25% are modestly below average but still much more attractive than likely bond returns over the next ten years.

Full and fair disclosure, I'm not an accountant, nor am I am equity analyst.  I work in the industry and I enjoy reading.  I am curious to see what any equity analysts in here think about the takeaways of the article.",17
16-07-07,4rplnl,Guide to not being an options retard: (repost of original by u/MightyDerek),"I thought this was a great guide that was deleted when u/MightyDerek deleted his post.  Someone posted a screenshot of it, so I thought I'd type it up and repost it for future faggots, weird capitalization and typos intact.

Ok so a quick options guide, because since that high school kid had his run the level of options retardism has ~~gone through the roof~~ remained unchanged.  So here is how to not blow up your account.

For Long Options (Just don't bother shorting options if you're reading this). Just follow this guide to maybe not completely waste your money.

**Explanations:**

Note: If a contract has a price of ""$1.35"" you pay $135/contract.

Thing|Description|Guidance
:--|:--|:--
Delta|Delta = 0.4 = For every $1 the underlying increases your options increases $0.4 = $40.  Calls have a (+) delta (increase in value when underlying goes up),puts have (-) delta (increase in price when underlying goes down)|Delta &lt; 0.3, probably avoid
Theta|Theta = -0.15 =your option contract decreases $0.15 every day = $15 per contract.  Theta increases closer to expiration, so weeklies lose value fast| 
Implied Volatility (IV)|High IV = More Expensive Option|Increases leading into earnings, drops after
Volatility Crush|IV Drops significantly after earnings making your options less valuable even if you guessed the direction right| 
Bid-Ask Spread|Difference between bid price and ask price of the option|Large spread = bad
Expiry|The contract is exercised after market close on this date.  Call = you have the right to buy 100 shares at the call's strike. Put you have the right to sell @ the strike.  Exercising usually costs a decent amount of money (~$30). If you're on here you can't afford either of these so don't worry about that.| 

**Strategy Guide**

Strategy|Description|Should I do it?
:--|:--|:--
""Faggot's Delight""|Weekly options (&lt;5DTE) + Plan to hold a few nights + Out of the money (Delta&lt;0.3)|no
Earnings Play|Buy weekly options w/ Delta &gt; 0.45 the night of earnings|ok
Earnings play|Buying a Weekly ATM straddle (1 Call + 1 Put)|No, you're not the first person to think of this. IV Crush will kill you
It's the middle of the day and SPY is done 1.5%+|You want to buy a weekly put|No (99% of the time), The market will move against or stagnate and you will either sell at a loss or hold overnight and let theta get you.
Shorting Calls/Puts|-|If you're learning from this guide, no

**Pre Purchase Checklist:**

If you check 2 or more things on this list, don't do it and save us the impending shitpost.

**Editor's note: If given strategy is inverse u/FSComeau you may safely check up to 4 boxes**

||Checklist
:--|:--
Is it a weekly? (&lt;5 Days to Expiry)|
Are Earnings this Week?|
Does it involve Oil?|
Is Delta &lt;0.3|
Is Implied Volatility &gt; 200?|
Is it what everyone else on WSB is doing?|
Is the underlying &lt;$20|
Does it involve a short call/put?|
Is the bid-ask spread&gt;$0.15/contract|

Edit:

Some people have mentioned using vertical spreads.  These are decent defined risk trades.  The only issue with these are (without getting into the math) that you will often find that verticals don't become profitable until very close to the expiration date unless there is a huge move int eh underlying.",60

16-07-08,4rthl7,Game Plan For The Non Farm Payrolls Report: Be Ready To Capitalize,"Within hours the Non Farm Payrolls Report will be released. This is the once a month jobs report that gives a clear picture on whether or not the economy is speeding up or slowing down. The stock market pays close attention to this number because the Federal Reserve bases a large part of their interest rate policy on it.

Analysts estimates range from 150,000 to 225,000. A number anywhere between 150,000 to 200,000 would be considered a goldilocks number and be very positive for the stock market. However, a number below 150,000 would be negative. Why? Because it would signal a slowing economy. Considering the Federal Reserve has almost no bullets left in their 'quantitative easing' gun, the markets would likely panic. A -300 day on the Dow Jones Industrial average would be likely. Should the jobs number come in north of 200,000, the markets would likely be flat to lower. Why? Because it would be interest rate hikes back on the table for later this year. You would see a sharp spike in yields and the Dollar would shoot higher. A higher Dollar would put pressure on gold, silver and oil.

Ultimately, the market is hoping for that perfect number. Not too hot, not too cold. Somewhere around 185,000 would be perfect in my humble opinion. If that happens, the S&amp;P could head to 2120 or higher.

A few things to note: There will be 35,000 jobs automatically added into this number because of the Verizon strike being over. Also, pay close attention to last months horrid number in terms of revisions. Revisions up would be very positive.",9

16-07-07,4rpuz0,Why crude oil had such huge drop,"*M o d s deleted the one I posted 15 minutes ago, hope they don't delete it again*

Today the EIA data was presented and crude oil has dropped from 48.20 to 45.00 (so far) based on the [data](http://ir.eia.gov/wpsr/wpsrsummary.pdf).

The market expectations where

* Crude Oil Inventories -2.250M

* EIA Weekly Distillates Stocks 0.031M

* Gasoline Inventories -0.353M


Data showed


* Crude Oil Inventories -2.223M

* EIA Weekly Distillates Stocks -1.574M

* Gasoline Inventories -0.122M


Not a huge miss and nothing to justify the huge 6.6% drop in crude oil prices. So why did crude oil drop so hard? It is all about production. US supply rose to 9.75 million barrels per day. 


The fear is that supply is growing, while demand may shrink. The fear is not only based on the US, but also sign that Libya, Nigeria and Canada may increase production. 

Although there is a truth in this fear, it does not justify a 6.6% drop. For the last few month my projection for 2016 has been that oil will remain between the $43 and $56  this year. I still believe that oil that. I [posted this](https://np.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/4jmd9r/oil_my_thoughts_and_expectations_basically_best/d37vyez) when oil was $45 and since then 2016 prices have been between the $45 and $54.

Good luck trading everyone.

I know there are a lot of tools already out there, and yeah I'm not into re-inventing the wheel. We are mostly building skills and hope to improve on existing services, and maybe find a niche to specialise in.",2

16-07-08,4rugv1,What Wilt Chamberlain Can Teach You About Investing,"On March 2, 1962 Wilt Chamberlain set an NBA record by scoring [100 points in a game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilt_Chamberlain%27s_100-point_game). He scored 28 points in free throws alone, another NBA record, going 28 for 32 (87.5%) from the line. While 100 points in a game is no small task, Wilt averaged 50.4 points per game and had already scored 78 points in a game that season.

What was more impressive in that game was his free throw percentage. Why? Wilt Chamberlain's [career average from the free throw line was 50.4%](https://youtu.be/ITxDdnzpnU8). So how did he shoot 87.5% that night? By [shooting his free throws underhanded](https://youtu.be/tU88dxJKTHI). So why didn't he permanently adopt the underhanded free throw permanently? Because, in his words, it made him [""feel silly, like a sissy.""](https://books.google.com/books?id=-Y7inUoP0NkC&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;ots=Emv7VrDQ5_&amp;dq=sissy%20wilt%20chamberlain%20free%20throw&amp;pg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) 

Malcolm Gladwell explored this and Wilt's inexplicable aversion to shooting underhanded in a [recent podcast](http://revisionisthistory.com/episodes/03-the-big-man-cant-shoot/). (A Q&amp;amp;A with Gladwell that touches on the same issue with [other NBA players](http://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/62100/dear-andre-drummond) is [here](http://www.si.com/nba/2016/06/30/malcolm-gladwell-wilt-chamberlain-rick-barry-nba-free-throw-granny-shot)). Ira Glass explores this topic, including other examples of people ""choosing wrong"", despite evidence suggesting a better outcome if they choose otherwise, in a [recent episode of This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/590/choosing-wrong).

Gladwell ties Wilt's choice to rebuff the underhanded free throw to Mark Granovetter's [threshold theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_model). In short, people with low thresholds are much more likely to follow the crowd, despite the advantages of not doing so. People with high thresholds are much more likely to ignore the social context of a behavior.

So how can this help you be a better investor? By being aware of our innate irrationality, we can avoid the herd mentality that led to the dotcom bubble. Awareness of this phenomenon can help you resist the latest trendy stock or strategy and to not lose sight of the underlying fundamentals of an asset. 

Knowing that your brain is working against you will hopefully prevent you from selling low and buying high, [like so many millions of investors still seem to do](http://www.northstarfinancial.com/files/6314/6523/9571/2016_DALBAR_Advisor_Edition.pdf).",19

***Back to the 1950s we go***…Moody’s Baa corporate bond spreads have cruised back to their tightest yield since Aug 1956 (at 4.2%), thanks to the ultra-low rate environment brought on by rising expectations of further monetary easing and the comfort that Brexit is a local, not a global, shock. 

And as the ‘50s spawned the age of the automobile—while today, notions of driverless automation swirl—the wheels will likely get greased up for a search for yield ride, a welcome auto-pilot mode for credit as the thick of summer sets in. The risk is that escalating systemic concerns in Europe—as the collapse in European bank equities reflect roadblocks to earnings—could put the brakes on the search for yield environment, but all eyes will be on the policy response to Italian banks that are most vulnerable in the low-growth environment.  

Back to 2Q, oh the records we set as risk-taking gained further momentum in both the primary and secondary markets, albeit punctuated by a (very) brief retreat to the bastions of safety. 

1.	CCC performance at post-crisis highs, returning 14% in 2Q and ranking amongst the top 5 best quarterly performances ever. While positively convex opportunities have shrunk—no CCC bonds in the index trade under $20 today vs. 1/10th on Feb 11—yield is still left over, with one third of CCCs yielding &gt;15%. Challenge ahead for CCCs remains much weaker fundamentals.

2.	IG M&amp;A supply from US issuers soared to record highs with $82bn pricing in 2Q, a 14% bump from 1Q despite overall IG volumes finishing down 2% QoQ. This figure is even more impressive considering that a near record $400bn of M&amp;A deals (also including equity deals) were pulled in 2Q due to stricter regulation. 

3.	EUR IG non-bank supply spiked to all-time highs (€62bn) as this cohort of CSPP-eligible issuers saw their borrowing costs fall to post-crisis tights. Conversely, EUR IG bank issuance—ineligible for the CSPP program—declined by 15% vs. 1Q. The ECB ended up relying less on the primary market than anticipated in the first month of the CSPP, with just 4% of their €6.4bn purchases occurring in the primary, but we expect this to normalize to a 30% share in line with the ECB’s past programs. 

4.	Longest loan outflow streak with 2Q extending the 9 quarter streak of redemptions. The consistency of the outflows far exceeds the magnitude, with a mere $72mm exiting on average per week. The concern is that the loan ownership structure is more concentrated—mutual funds own 20% and CLOs own 80%--making the asset class more vulnerable to outflows with dim prospects of attracting retail investors in a no-to-one-rate hike regime.

  
Fun fact: Back to the future, today $1,000 can buy computer power equivalent to that of an insect’s brain, with the expectation that the same amount can buy the equivalent of a mouse’s brain in a few years and a human brain by 2020, according to IBM Watson’s previous CEO.

It has now grown into Japans and almost all other major Asian country (except China) most popular free  messaging service. Its pretty much the Japanese version of Whatsapp. It allows free messaging between users along with other features like games, the ability to order food and so on.

BETTER INVESTMENT THAN TWITTER:
ITS ALREADY PROFITABLE. One of the major things this company has going for it is that its profitable. Almost all of its profits come from advertising which is expected to grow significantly. the company is very stable, all 3 of its creators are still on board. 

A few other Notes as well as some headwinds:
If your like me and didnt know what wtf Line was until news about the IPO dropped your not alone. Outside of Asia Line has a very small user base and faces steep competition from the likes of Whatsapp. This is the main knock against Line; can it grow and penetrate the western market? From what people familiar with both services say, Line has a better user interface along with better features however that may not be enough to tap into Western markets who already have Whatsapp. 

Another thing worth mentioning is that it will be a twin listing spread between NY and Tokyo, as in the stock will go Public in NY July 14 and then Public in Japan the next day. I for one have never seen anything like this and am not sure how that will effect the stock at all. Perhaps someone could shed some light on that for us. 

In all this is a short term play for me. The company is sound and the market is in desperate short supply of good IPO's. I believe going full YOLO on opening day and holding for 2-3 months (maybe even just a few days to lock in gainz) is the play for this stock. The stagnant growth and competition going forward are real issues for the company in the long term.

P.S. if you want to ignore everything i just wrote here is the skinny, on July 14 take every YOLO dime you have and invest in this Japanese rice rocket called Line ($LN) and ride it straight to our moon Yachts where only the finest sake and sushi will be served. See you in orbit faggots!",29

16-07-08,4rwd8k,Best Investing Books for the Beginner-Intermediate Investor,"I've decided to dedicate a large chunk of this summer to better educating myself financially. I believe financial education can go a long way. I find it pretty crazy how people will spend ~9 hours a day grinding away at their work for a paycheck, only to make spending/investing mistakes and miss out on great opportunities due to a lack of financial education.

Below, I've compiled a list of books that I find to be extremely beneficial for the beginner-intermediate investor.

* The Elements of Investing by Burton Malkiel 
* A Beginners Guide to Investing by Ivy Bytes 
* A Random Walk Down Wall Street (11th Ed.) by Burton Malkiel 
* Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki 
* Think and Grow Rich (Revised and Updated for the 21st Century) by Napoleon Hill 
* The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John C Bogle 
* Money Master the Game by Tony Robbins 
* If you can: How Millennials can get rich slowly by William J Bernstein 
* Retire Inspired by Chris Hogan 
* The Richest Man in Babylon by George Clason 
* The Total Money Makeover by Dave Ramsey

Pick any two (or whatever you can read) and see if you can read those by the end of summer, and believe me, you may be more financially prepared on what to do with money. Also, please feel free to comment any of your own favorite financial/investing reads, as well as any opinions on those I've listed above!",11

# Description
BlackRock, Inc. is an investment management company. The Company provides a range of investment and risk management services to institutional and retail clients across the world. Its offerings include single and multi-asset class portfolios investing in equities, fixed income, alternatives and money market instruments. 

In fact they are one of the largest asset managers in the world. Maybe you own one of their iShares ETFs of have a 401k managed by them?

## Recent financials 

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $11.4bn | $11.1bn | $10.2bn | $9.3bn | $9.1bn|
|EPS | $19.79 | $19.25 | $16.87 | $13.79 | $12.37|

## Competition
From their SEC filing

&gt; The investment management industry is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry. BlackRock competes based on a number of factors including: investment performance, the level of fees charged, the quality and diversity of services and products provided, name recognition and reputation, and the ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors.

In fact competition is coming both from (a) other traditional asset managers like Fidelity, Schwab, etc (b) from a shift way from high cost mutual funds to low cost ETFs (c) a heightened interest in alternative asset managers, like Blackstone. 

Operating margins are wonderful in this industry. :) Though given their is quasi-fix cost in managing other people's money, that's not a surprise. Though in a recession that can hurt too.

Note: I've included the private equity / alternatives stocks too: Blackstone, Carlyle, KKR and Oaktree, but their financials make no sense to me :(

KKR &amp; Co. L.P. | $915M | -ve | -ve
Oaktree Capital Group LLC | $406M | -ve | N/A

BlackRock, Inc. has $116M of net cash. That is a tiny % of it's market value. Though as with many financial stocks, the balance sheet is often a mystery

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $387.14 for BlackRock, Inc. and their recommendation to clients is *Buy*. That implies an upside of 16% to their target.

# Valuation

The following table shows the key valuation metrics. Again, as with the margins and returns of the alternatives... their valuation stats look odd. Perhaps these stocks are ""asset plays"" where you look at the net asset value and the price relative to that. Alternatively you ""clip the coupon"" i.e. take the dividend and hope the DPS isn't going south.

PE Peers|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|

KKR | $9,760M | 22x | 23% | 5% | 16%
OAK | $7,102M | 20x | 35% | 5% | N/A

As for $BLK and the traditional asset managers, there appear to be a few dogs in the group. And those dogs like $BEN and $AMP have pretty nice FCF yields, so it's odd they aren't churning out cash, at first glance. $BLK isn't highly rated, but at 17x and a 3% divie it's not cheap. Though suppose you get way you pay for!

# Dividends
BlackRock, Inc. is forecast to pay a dividend of $9.16 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $8.83 per share. That is a 4% growth. Nice enough.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 1% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 0%. So you could say, it's steady as she goes. Though that is against a backdrop of revenues down 4% in the last 3 months.

Recently BlackRock bought a robo-advisor. Perhaps they can use this to drive a new business line. Similarly, their Solutions division has a risk-analytics tool called Aladdin that is the talk of the asset management industry. That could make large clients less likely to churn. Though against these possible nice catalysts are there clouds out there too? The markets' peaking? The ETF steam-roller?

For me, 17x seems a little rich at this staging in the cycle, even for a well managed business like $BLK. But happy to be persuaded otherwise!

16-07-08,4rt7ve,How do dividend payments affect stock price?,"I've been thinking at purchasing dividend stocks but I keep coming across a concept that could really use some explaining. So if the record date is this coming Friday, the ex-dividend date would be this coming Wednesday. So in order to receive the dividend payment, I'd have to buy the stock by the end of Tuesday. But everything I've seen says the stock will decrease by the price of the dividend payment.

So let's say there's a stock holding steady at $100/share and it pays a dividend of $1 per quarter. If I buy 1 share of the stock on Monday, will the price then drop to $99 on Wednesday? And will the price ever return to $100?",14

I didn't sleep all night. I puked all morning long. This seems like some kind of sick game. Can someone explain why the market moved up today? No. It just moved up to piss me off. Sometimes, I think about all the money I lost in JUST ONE WEEK and I burst into random tears. This is absolutely unbelievable. I've never seen anything like this in my 15+ career as a trader.

I still can't believe this is real. Sometimes, I look at the screen and I just don't believe what I see. This has been the worst week in my life. Absolutely everything I've said was wrong. This is the biggest one-week loss I've ever had by a HUGE HUGE margin. And it happened precisely at a moment I couldn't afford it.

I know I will eventually get this money back. The market will crash, sooner rather than later, but it's still unbelievably hard. I have no one else to blame here, but WTF the market recovered from ""Brexit"" so quickly it's not even funny. Like it never happened. A 5% crash? Insta-recovery within days! This is absolutely sickening.

I am done making a fool out of myself. I still can't believe this is real and sometimes i wish I could wake up from this nightmare. Why the FUCK does the market do the opposite of everything I do? It's like some hedge fund is reading this and purposedly ruining me for shit and giggles. ""Oh fscomeau did that, let's fucking break him by doing the opposite.""

I am just speechless. This is insane. I'm out. If people want a last prediction from me - I know the market is about to massively crash. Once it drops below 2,100, probably within days, you won't see the S&amp;P above 2,100 for a very long time - possibly ever again in your lifetime (depending on your life expectancy). I would massively short the S&amp;P here and if you are waiting on the sidelines, you have been given a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to mass short it. The level it is at right now is crazy and way, way too high. Mass short SPY.

16-07-08,4rwn7q,You dildoes need to understand unemployment numbers,"[I addressed this a bit] (https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/4n5d59/buy_spy_puts_ahead_of_the_jobs_report_tomorrow/d413y9x) when the last jobs report came out, but it's worth repeating and diving into some more detail for those that follow macro data.  

**There are 6 measures of unemployment**

Not one, six.  There are six metrics used to determine the overall unemployment picture, and they do in fact count all the shit people think doesn't get counted.  Every time there is a jobs report that is slightly positive people say ""oh, that's just because people stopped looking for jobs"" or ""those are all part time jobs!""  ZeroHedge likes to post about how ""economists are ignoring the *real* unemployment numbers""! (Labor economists hate him!)  You know, because economists are so fucking stupid that they just don't count obvious numbers because they're too dumb to know their relevance, right?  Wrong.  They not only count them, but they clearly break them down by segment.   The six measures are as follows:

* U-1: Persons unemployed 15 weeks or longer, as a percent of the civilian labor force  
* U-2: Job losers and persons who completed temporary jobs, as a percent of the civilian labor force  
* U-3: Total unemployed, as a percent of the civilian labor force (official unemployment rate)  
* U-4: Total unemployed plus discouraged workers, as a percent of the civilian labor force plus discouraged workers  
* U-5: Total unemployed, plus discouraged workers, plus all other persons marginally attached to the labor force, as a percent of the civilian labor force plus all persons marginally attached to the labor force  
* U-6: Total unemployed, plus all persons marginally attached to the labor force, plus total employed part time for economic reasons, as a percent of the civilian labor force plus all persons marginally attached to the labor force  

*Edit: This data is available at the [BLS website](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm)*

The U-3 number is the one commonly referred to as ""the unemployment rate"".  Looking at the spread between U3 and U4 tells you about discouraged workers, and U3 and U4 are usually pretty close, meaning that there aren't that many discouraged workers in relative terms.  If U4 takes off from U3, then can say there might be tons of discouraged workers, but that is not usually the case. U6 is a measure of underemployment as well as unemployment.  But if you see how the number is calculated, underemployment is *not* the same as unemployment.  Despite all the hysteria that the ""actual unemployment rate is 10%+"" because U6 is ~10, that simply isn't true.  You can argue that 10% is still too high for underemployment, but the trend since we started measuring that value in 1995 has been 10 plus or minus a few points and it did indeed shoot up very high during the GFC.  But it is currently in line with historical numbers.  **In other words: we are currently near full employment in the US** 

**There is a natural rate of unemployment and labor force participation**

Unemployment should never be 0% and labor force participation should never be 100%.  You know what societies have unemployment rates of 0% with labor force participation rates of 100%?  Really fucking poor ones.  Societies where everyone - old or young, sick or healthy, able or disabled - *must* work because they would starve otherwise.  Unemployment will never be 0% and we don't want it do be 0%.  Instead, full employment is typically closer to the 4-5% range for U3 and the 9-10% range for U6.  Most people know this, but what they don't consider as a logical consequence of this is that *rates of job growth should slow down as we approach the natural rate*.  We should not expect the same number of jobs added each month when U3 is near 5% as we do when U3 is near 10% and we're coming out of a recession.  Job growth is asymptotic as it approaches that 4-5% barrier and there will be a resistance to push past that.  It's not a deficiency of the labor market, it's a natural consequence of structural and frictional unemployment.  

Another claim I see is that the labor force participation rate is super low, suggesting that all the unemployment numbers are wrong because they're based on an artificially deflated number of people in the labor force.  But that's not true either.  Labor force participation is actually quite a bit *higher* than during the 50s, 60s, and 70s [Source](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/labor-force-participation-rate).  Yes, there is a drop relative to the 90s and 00s, but that started in the late 90s (before the dot com crash and long before the GFC) and could be due to any number of reasons that don't warrant freaking out about.  Also, it's not like the number fell by half - it's down a few points from the peak, which itself was a large deviation from the longer term average. 

**Jobs numbers need to be placed in the context of rates and overall population**

If I told you that some country only added 20 jobs in a month, you'd probably be like ""oh, that place is boned, how can I short it?"".  But if that country is the Vatican City and only has a population of 1,000, then adding 20 jobs is actually pretty fucking good. ([relevant satire](https://www.thebeaverton.com/world/item/2731-vatican-city-unemployment-rate-soars-to-five))  The point? Don't be moved by seemingly large numbers in the tens of thousands when it comes to interpreting job data in the US.  This is a *huge* country.  We have 350 Million people in the country, and a civilian labor force of almost 160 Million people.  When I read Zero Hedge articles that scarily ask [""What If I Told You Employment Actually Declined 119,000 In June?""] (http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-07-08/bearish-david-rosenberg-reemerges-what-if-i-told-you-employment-actually-declined-11) my response is: so fucking what?  Even if that's true, you're talking about a .07% change in the total labor force numbers - that's a god damn rounding error and should be well within any reasonable person's expectation of the accuracy of numbers of this scale.  Hell, the BLS data aggregation isn't even done to two decimal places. 

**The Lesson?  Stop paying attention to headlines about jobs data**

This data is readily available and, really, very easy to digest.  Headlines about this data tend to oversimplify the situation at best and be downright misleading at worst.  Everyone crapped their pants when the last job report came out in June, and yet it was a total overreaction.  The data was *fine*.  U3 and U4 both *went down* from April to May, and yet people were freaking out because the absolute number of jobs missed expectations (the error I mentioned in the preceding paragraph).  It's completely asinine.  I shorted the living shit out of volatility during that over-reaction and profited handsomely because everyone thought the world was coming to an end instead of just looking at the god damn freely available data that takes up less than half a page. So, learn to read and interpret readily available data instead of outsourcing that thinking to other entities that may have an agenda (or just be retarded).  As always, hugs, kisses, and go fuck yourselves.

**Edit: A final note: Unemployment data is almost certainly _not_ manipulated**

The last piece I need to address here is the frequent claim that this data is manipulated.  First, let me say that I dislike and distrust government authority very much. I am skeptical of pretty much every government claim and action that comes from the corrupt hellhole that is Washington DC and I think both political parties are completely insane, retarded, or both.  In other words: I'm no government shill.  However, your tinfoil hat is on *way* too tight if you think that there is some sort of cohesive government conspiracy to inflate job data.  Who would be doing it?  And who would benefit?  You could argue that republicans in congress have an incentive to lean on the BLS and show good jobs numbers so that *they* get re-elected.  But wouldn't it also be possible for the democratic administration (and non-trivial numbers of democrats in the congress) to do the same?  And who's to say how the public will interpret the data?  Do good or bad job numbers reflect on the administration or the congress?  How do all these varying factions all vying for political power draw public opinion one way or another based on data sets this large and public?  For you to believe that this data is manipulated maliciously, you have to believe that there is one underlying ruling faction in DC that calls the shots and perfectly manipulates the data every time so that it roughly fits with independent analyses and the overall macroeconomic picture which is studied by literally tens of thousands of people whose job it is to study said data.  And if that's the case, why would we ever have *bad* data?  Why did 2008-2009 have bad jobs data at all if the NWO/lizard people/zionist jews (those are the things people are afraid of, right?) have complete and utter control over the data?  No, the far more likely scenario is that the BLS data is actually pretty good and can be reasonably used to measure macroeconomic variables to the extent that we are capable of measuring them.  So take of the tinfoil hats and embrace the data. ",343

16-07-08,4rwp10,Understanding Tax Harvesting?,"Let's walk through a scenario regarding tax harvesting.  Let's say I have $100k.  It was invested in SPY years ago.

* May 1st: I sold my SPY investment and realized $10k in long term gains.  
* August 1st: I buy $100k of VOO (a similar but different fund).
* November 1st: The market tanks.  I sell at a $10k loss.  
* December 2nd: Buy SPY for the long haul.

As I understand it,  the $10k loss from selling VOO offset the taxes from the initial $10k realized gain.  Is that right?

It seems like you really have to get lucky in terms of market fluctuation to make tax loss harvesting work.  There is also a risk that, the market bounces back in the 30 days you wait (November to December in this example) and you've missed out.  Or am I missing something?  Is there a better way to offset the $10k in long term gains already realized?",1

I apply for an account as a non US person as I am a non resident alien. 

I fund my account during application with an ACH transfer. 

Costumer service tells me that it is IB policy to have non resident aliens living in the US for a prolonged time (student) and hence to start a new application as a US person, I am also told my money will be returned to the originating account.

I apply for US account and my account is opened, nothing strange here. 

My older account application continues to show as ""pending"" although I am told it was rejected: my money does not come back.

Costumer service tells me they won't return my funds for 40 business days (2 and a half months since I transferred the money, essentially) unless my bank asks for a ""recall"" of the ACH, which my bank tells me they cannot do.

The hold seems to also contradict their own rules:
https://ibkb.interactivebrokers.com/node/567/

"" Also note that ACH deposits are subject to a 4 business day credit hold after arrival prior to being credited to your account.  In addition,  if funds are withdrawn to a bank other than the originating bank, a 40-business-day withdrawal hold period will be applied.""

This is the only place such hold seems mentioned and I am trying to send the money back to the originating account!

UPDATE: apparently the supervisor says that I have to wait the two months because their system is automated and  they can't solve the bug on my account... this is beyond parody, what if it were 1 million dollars, would they really keep it for 2 months without any compensation, because of a problem on their end? I suspect it would be illegal, in my case it is not enough money to bother though...

This forum pointed me to https://portfoliocharts.com/ and what I've read there is very interesting.  I am now considering changing my portfolio philosophy to something more like [this](https://portfoliocharts.com/portfolio/golden-butterfly/) for higher sustained withdrawal rates.

The tradeoff is overall expected returns may go down a little, but volatility should go down a lot.  I've retired but my wife is still working and is likely to do so for a few more years, so there will be little if any immediate withdrawals.

One of my biggest concerns regarding changing right now is that I am overweight in international stocks.

Of course any stock can move big on earnings due to an outsized situation, but there is a trend to these things.  Look at the stock you're wanting to trade and its last 4 earnings reports.  If 2/3/4 of those reports it moved 10% - then don't make a trade that requires little move.

16-07-09,4ryl2z,Apple breaking pattern and skipping next cycle of design changes,"&gt; Apple Inc. plans to break with its recent pattern of overhauling the design of its flagship iPhone every two years, and make only subtle changes in the models it will release this fall, according to people familiar with the matter.

&gt; Apple plans bigger design changes for 2017, the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone. Those changes could include an edge-to-edge organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, screen and eliminating the home button by building the fingerprint sensor into the display, according to people familiar with the matter.

&gt; In the past, Apple has introduced new iPhones on a “ticktock” cycle. Apple delivers major design changes every other year—the “tick” years—followed by software improvements and hardware refinements in the “tock” years.

&gt; It isn’t clear whether this year’s shift is a temporary or permanent departure from this pattern. Either way, it comes at a precarious moment for the iPhone, Apple’s most important product, accounting for two-thirds of the company’s revenue.

&gt; At a meeting with an Apple executive last month, one of the company’s China-based engineers asked why this year’s model lacked a major design change in keeping with Apple’s usual two-year cycle. The answer, one person at the meeting recalled, was that the new technology in the pipeline will take time to implement.

&gt; People familiar with the matter said some features that Apple hopes to integrate into iPhones, such as curved screens, weren't ready for this year’s models.

http://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-unlikely-to-make-big-changes-for-next-iphone-1466526489

So even with a multi-year development cycle, they couldn't figure out how to improve the iPhone 7...and by the time they figured it out...it was too late. 

Curved OLED phone screens have been around for several years, this is not brand new technology. Not sure why its so hard to implement something Samsung implemented several years ago.

I get that genuine innovation can be hard. Creativity isn't something you can teach. But there's no excuse for not even implementing the innovative features other smartphone makers are coming up with. 

I think a lot of people were hoping the expected iPhone 7 design refresh would pull Apple out of its 12-month slump. It looks like both apple consumers and apple shareholders are in for a bad surprise.

Not sure what's going on at Apple but someone should be fired for this. ",42

16-07-09,4s2yja,"S&amp;P 500 DD","I mostly like to trade with basic TA, intuition, small positions and big dreams. I love buying cheap options on expiry and seeing how many I can flip for profit, for one. This is a pretty long post, so I have 3 sections - feel free to read just one if you want. a) inverse fsc b) What's next? c) How to make mad money imo

a) I think the most interesting thing happening in the market so far is how sentiment keeps flip-flopping from ""rate hike is good: signals strong economy"" to ""rate hike is bad: we still want our easy money"". To me, the market is looking for an excuse to go higher. But, it's weird - aren't we in the second longest bull market in history? Why on earth is gold AND the market rallying so hard together?!

I feel that Brexit felt like the biggest kick in the balls to everyone that the world is going to shit, just much slower than it has in the past. I feel that smart money is slowly moving into gold with the newly available capital they are getting from covering their short and long term shorts. Moreover, foreign institutions have recently bid up US assets in general. If you think hedge funds like to play in bad times like Jan, you bet your ass they make MAD EASY money when the market rallies 5.12% in the week post-Brexit. We could have a rally for a good amount of time - anywhere from a month to a year in my opinion. Our lord and savior did the best inverse he could for all us plebs - he indirectly called the last bottom of this bull market...

b) I think what happens next depends on the schedule of future global events. If Trump becomes President, who the fuck knows what can happen. Stocks will be volatile, I feel that's all I can say with certainty. If there is a surprise recession, the fed could cut rates and stocks could rally for a while in denial while more smart money gets out.

I think there are two 'broader' outcomes, regardless of the timeline. Either the market 'stagnates' and cools off for a year or two, or we crash somewhat hard (thinking S&amp;P 1700 or so). If we cool off, I think this will solely be because the US won't have it as bad as other countries. The picture worldwide isn't pretty. Yes, a lot of it is doomsday hearsay, but weren't we all about China? Oil? Fed? like 5 months ago? The US is just about 'okay', while China and now Europe have a lot of glaring problems that mostly boil down to financials. Investors are always trying to hedge their bets, and one would be a fool not to make money off that.

On the other hand, we could crash pretty hard. I think we would then recover slightly, but then enter a series of lower lows and lower highs. I feel that could go down for 2-3 years, before we stagnate and then enter into another bull market. Idk where the world is headed 50 years from now, but I personally feel certain issues like global warming and ISIS could evolve into something much nastier if the world leaves it unchecked.

c) Money time boyz. Now, I'm pretty new to options, but I love it. There are a lot of fancy strategies that can definitely make you short term money, but this is a slightly longer term bet. But it's still a yolo. Just a yolo you need to be slightly lucky for. The luck comes in calling the bottom. For now, gold is a good bet, but keep some cash handy for when this bull market runs out of steam.

At the bottom, with as much money as you DO NOT GIVE A FUCK ABOUT, throw your dollars into a basket of OTM calls dated about 6 months - 1 year from then (depends on your preference and time frame). This has to happen at YOUR BEST GUESS FOR THE BOTTOM AS POSSIBLE. This is slightly inspired by the best Brexit DD post I saw, eventhough Brexit turned out to be a nonissue. /r/wallstreetbets/comments/4pkuhh/tomorrow_is_the_buying_opportunity_you_wait_years/

This guy got it right. Some nice OTM calls bought that Friday would have made a shit ton by today. I'm too lazy to math atm, but I'm thinking some calls that were worth $0.05 could easily have been worth $3-6 today.

If the S&amp;P goes to 1800 within the next year, for the love of God pray that you have some cash to dump into far out expiry calls on your favourite stocks. Whatever you like to play.

Some sub picks: FB, AMZN, NFLX, GOOG, TSLA, VRX, ABX, SWHC, AMD, etc.

Some sub picks that I prefer: ATVI, EA, TTWO, SNE, NVDA (If I only had $1000, I'd put it all on this baby), HL (this one you can buy today and still have a good time).

16-07-09,4s17tg,[Shorting Nintendo] A play I would do if I had money,"-Nintendo has been on a long string on failures. The Wii U is a disaster. Their latest games underperform. People are growing tired with the 10+ annual mario games

-Nintendo is [losing money](http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/post-arcade/nintendo-co-announces-nx-release-date-and-zelda-details-in-us216m-loss-earnings-report) and has no way to turn it around. Microsoft and Sony are ripping it apart.

-The stock jumped for no reason. Yes, Pokemon Go is nice, but like all things Nintendo does, they'll fuck it up.

-Once the novelty factor wears off, Pokemon Go will die a slow death.

-The revenue from Pokemon Go are minimal at best. $0.99, of which Apple takes a 33% cut? Lol.

-Although Nintendo has some cash streams, they squander way too much money and what do they have to show for it? A useless, boring, old, unsellable Wii U. Even their games are starting to get stale.

-I don't think Nintendo will die, but it will follow the path of Best Buy. At the very least, the stock will crash 50% from its current level.

-The stock went down from 70k to 8k. If that doesn't tell you something, I don't know what else will.

Nintendo is not a horrible company, but it's not even decent neither. It's somewhat bad. The stock is overpriced at a ridiculous P/E of 118, with very little coming to turn the tide. If they can't make money off the Wii U now, how are they gonna make money in 3-4 years? 

The market they are in is simply too competitive and has shifted beneath their feet. What used to be a formidable company is now a GREAT short opportunity. See: Atari.",58

16-07-10,4s5p0q,Consumer Staples + Shareholder Yield = Higher Returns + Lower Risk,"In [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/4qldg6/trending_value_breaking_down_a_proven/), I introduced trending value, a strategy develop by James O'Shaughnessy in his book What Works on Wall Street. He also looked at how different factors fared within individual sectors of the stock market. He found the best performing factor for the consumer staples sector was shareholder yield (SHY), which is buybacks + dividends.

To replicate the consumer staples value strategy, purchase the top 25 stocks in the all stocks universe sorted by highest SHY (rebalance annually, as with all the strategies in the book).

This is a more robust strategy than trending value as is does not rely on multiple factors which would make it prone to data mining. It has demonstrated higher return and lower risk than the overall market as presented in the book.

[Strategy Performance \(1968 - 2009\)](http://i.imgur.com/b339ERs.png) (nominal performance, does not include slippage or commission, not discussing utilities strategy in this post)

It outperforms the market with lower standard deviation.  A limitation of just looking at standard deviation is that it accounts for upside risk and downside risk, but since upside risk is a good thing, a more useful measure is downside deviation, which only measures downside risk.

The lower the downside deviation, the less likely the return will be lower than expected. In other words, the lower the downside deviation, the less risk the strategy has when stock prices are falling.

Here is the strategy out of sample (book published in 2011). Better returns and lower drawdowns.

If anyone knows of anything better, please feel free to chime in!

Thanks in advance.

I forgot to mention, I am concerned about the expense ratio differences between admiral shares and VTTSX. VFIAX and VTSAX have expense ratios of 0.05% while VTTSX has an expense ratio of 0.16%. Considering this fact, are target retirement funds still worth having over conventional index funds?

1) seres therapeutics MCRB is having p2 data. This is very important, there has been massive insider selling following incredibly good p1 data. So the stock has been torn between the clinical trial phenomenal data and the really nasty insider selling. If you want a full recap altumresearch has our summary article on seeking alpha http://seekingalpha.com/article/3962932-seres-therapeutics-need-know-will-first-prescription-microbiome-company
 but here's the tl;dr:
The company takes the intestinal gut bacteria from healthy individuals, and filters them out for a concoction of just a handful of bacteria that are conserved in healthy individuals. They then put this in a pill and if you're suffering from serious gut bacteria infections (*c.diff* which kills 20,000 people a year), your cured... 29/30 at least in the p1.
P2 data any day. With the Nestlé collaboration, I used to think they were too expensive to get bought out but I don't think so anymore.

2) Scynexis $Scyx is a company releasing a p2 again, here's our more in depth article http://seekingalpha.com/article/3986354-scynexis-proven-drug-much-needed-market-analysis .
Tl; dr the company is making a new anti fungal medicine that seems to be about as effective as the standard of care but, in many cases will be effective when the final infection becomes resistance to the standard of care. The kicker is that this thing is orally active, where other similar drugs are necessarily IV. There's a lot of market potential for the drug depending on how they design their P3s but be careful to buy before the p2 as outlined in the article. Buy out target of they show equal to or better than standard of care in upcoming p2.

3) CytRx or $cytr. P3 results as soon as Monday. Jesus Christ if you talk about cytr in any bearish manner on stocktwits or Yahoo message boards be prepared for full on autistic hate. They are a relentless group and I think it's because very few of them are intelligent or understand science. There are a sudden splurge of cytr articles this past week, and I have an inclination they have been paid for by cytr, since cytr gas done this in the past and got a small also on the wrist.

Anyway, we again have an article on them, but the basics are the drug seems to perform as good as the standard of care, but it has no cardiotoxicity which is very good. I believe, with all the data I've seen, that they are basically able to deliver doxorubicin to the body in much higher quantities and somehow it avoids cardiotoxic events. There are usually more AEs associated with cytr drug versus the standard though (other than cardiotoxic). It's iffy but I think the company is going to get away with their p3 being a success. I think PDUFA will destroy them though.

4) RIGL or Rigel therapeutics has a P3 by mid July and it's interesting. For an autoimmune disease that targets platelets and blood cells. They shut down a MASTER REGULATOR of immune response and show decent results in previous trials. The problem is in caps. I have a feeling it's doing to be extremely effective in proving it works but I am curious if it will work too well and people will end up developing serious infections or die from the flu, etc.

I'm playing MCRB with half my portfolio.
I'm waiting until after p2 to buy some long term scyx.
I'm holding about $100 in cytr for yolo
I'm not holding RIGL

After doing a bit of research on the topic it seems that the chances of the phase 3 trial going well are extremely low, for a few reasons

1. A drug already exists that does what MST-888 is aiming to do, and it does it better (hydroxyurea).
2. MST-888 has been around for almost 20 years under different names and has had failed/had the same results every time, and Mast has changed almost nothing about it.
3. Due to the nature of the drug and the amount of time it takes to work, there is no possible way for the results to show the ""best case scenario"".

16-07-11,4s8xio,"A Review of Robo-Advisors (Vanguard, Betterment, etc.) [WARNING: LONG POST]","[**In response to the question: What is the best robo-advisor?**](https://www.quora.com/What’s-the-best-robo-advisor?share=1)

To dissect this topic, I want to break it down by a custom [FinTech Pyramid](http://imgur.com/a/0dqAc) that I created to answer this question.


As you can see with my infographic, I separate assets and liabilities among five groups:

* Savers
* Experimenters
* Career Makers
* Accumulators
* Preservers

I will base my analysis on each group, as I believe it is easiest to declare winners in each, based on the needs of the end users, and thus how robos have segmented the market.

**Introduction**

A firm that targets everybody, really targets nobody.

This question is very much like asking, what is the best fast food restaurant, or what is the best car? Do you want mexican or pizza? Fast casual or sit down? An economy car or luxury? Electric car or gas guzzler?

If you want to think about it like the ETF market, are you looking for an index fund or something more specialized - a Vanguard Group or a Wisdomtree? You can’t pick a “best” ETF because they are targeting different markets.

**FinTech Pyramid — Savers**


This segment I define as being very tied to their new financial independence. They are entering college or the workforce and have established their own bank accounts, debit cards, and are starting to pay their own bills. Any robo solution needs to address these needs.

The main players here would be Acorns (Brokerage), Digit, Stash.

Acorns (Brokerage) really was the innovator in this customer segment. For years, it was derided to offer investment focused products to college students. This has since changed that Snapchat (product) and others have announced their intention to get more involved in fintech. But, the thought of offering an investment product to those with only $100 or maybe even less to invest was very disruptive.

What Acorns did was take a page from the old Bank of America (company) ‘Keep the Change Program’ and combine it with the robo principles that were created by Betterment (product/company).


Instead of investing in a near 0% interest rate Savings Account, Acorns decided to engineer it as an investment account in the stock market instead.


It has paid off, as of the time of this writing, Acorns has 472,000 accounts!


The negative - they charge $1 per month on balances below $5,000. Given their average account size I calculate to be around $155, that means the average person is paying 7.7% per year in fees.

But, I am a strong believer in consumer driven economics, customers love this app and don’t seem to care about the high fees. If interest rates go up, I believe this customer segment can move towards something like Digit, but at 0% that is hard to do.

*Winner: Acorns*

**FinTech Pyramid — Experimenters**


This market I define as being UI UX focused. They are first time investors in the market, thus the experience needs to be fast, seamless, and educational. Robinhood (Brokerage) has done a brilliant job targeting this audience. According to a Fortune report, their average customer age is 26. They make it very simple, clean, and FREE to buy your first stocks.

Likewise, I have always been impressed with the clean UI/UX of Betterment (product/company) and how many little bells and whistles they have to make their app simple for a complimentary wealth audience. There is a reason why they have attracted over 100,000 clients. It is very easy to use for first time investors.


Acorns also has a very nice interface that wins a lot of awards for their UI/UX. You could argue they have a good product for the Savers and Experimenters.


But Betterment has a much more robust technology platform that cuts across web and mobile, while Acorns is strictly mobile and it it focused more on savings (through the round up the change feature). Betterment also has been in the market longer managing money, and has a large Data Science department that puts out many interesting studies. For these reasons, I believe they are the clear winner in this segment.

*Winner: Betterment (product/company)*

**FinTech Pyramid — Career Makers**


For those in Generation X and Millennial Generation that are just getting their careers on track, the biggest thing they are looking for is investing robustness and features. They are 20–30 years away from being able to reach a Private Bank like Goldman Sachs Private Wealth Management, and they may only have $50,000 saved up, not nearly enough to access a private bank. According to Barron’s, the median minimum investment on these private banking platforms is $3 Million.

Some of the biggest things here that are wanted would be access, investing sophistication, and breadth of platform. On the liabilities sign they are most likely starting to re-finance their student debt and using more high end crdit cards like American Express (company). They are also driven by things like rewards and new experiences.

Career makers want to go into work and tell their friends that they just invested in the next Uber (company). This comes down to what I define as “access.” Below, we show the current portfolio makeup of a Hedgeable portfolio.


This includes our own Venture Capital fund that has a $1 minimum investment, integration with Coinbase for bitcoin and soon Ethereum (virtual currency) and more products in the pipeline lie P2P Lending investments, private real estate, and green energy. Hedgeable also allows clients to change the entire makeup of their portfolio to be Impact Investing focused, or called SRI in the industry -


Career makers also want to make sure their growing sums are at least attempted to be protected from big collapses like the 2008 Financial Crisis. Remember, this demographic was in the Experimenters segment during the crisis, and they were deeply hurt by the aftermath. This comes down to what I define as “investing sophistication.”

Below, I show GIPS compliant client composite performance of Hedgeable clients from Jan 1 - Feb 11 of 2016, versus a passive “Robo Index” that we have developed.


What is Hedgeable's investment philosophy?

A third decision point here would be what I call the “breadth of platform.” Are you a small business owner? Do you want to open an account for kids? The “best” robo-advisor might not even be able to take your money because of limited account types! So this could be a very important determining factor for career makers.

Wealthfront currently supports taxable investment accounts including individual, joint and trust accounts. We also support Traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, SEP IRAs, and Rollover IRAs.

Betterment is harder to pin down, because they separate all of the account types into separate FAQ questions based on goals, but it seems like they offer about the same number as Wealthfront, with one or two exceptions.

Hedgeable offers the most account types. In addition to all those listed above, Hedgeable has 27 account types, including 4 different joint accounts and popular small business account types like SIMPLE IRAs and Solo 401ks.


Because of these three dynamics, I believe Hedgeable is the winner for Career Makers.

*Winner: Hedgeable*

**FinTech Pyramid — Accumulators**


This segment has reached the pinnacle of their careers, and their earnings start to level off. They have “access” due to their typically larger account balances than those lower on the pyramid.

They have accumulated many accounts across savings, checking, mortgage, investments. They are looking for the most robust app to keep track of these finances.

The average American in this demographic spreads investment accounts across 3 or more firms. They also have 4 or more credit cards, 2 or more kids ready to go off to college, at least 1 mortgage, 2 or more insurance premiums and health accounts, and much more. PLUS, I call them accumulators, because the numbers get larger as they reach their 60s and 70s.

This leads many to need a very robust suite of Personal Financial Management (PFM) apps to look at these accounts.

Personal Capital has done a very good job of targeting this demographic. As of the time of this writing, they have over 1 Million downloads of their PFM apps, which like Mint.com (product) was originally, are built on top of the Yodlee (company) aggregation software. Other platforms have PFM, but Personal Capital is by far the most robust.



Personal Capital allows you to hire one of their advisors if you want to talk to someone about your accounts and build an investment plan.


I like to think about Personal Capital as the only true player in the market that is disruptive to the advisory industry. Whereas firms like Acorns, Betterment, Hedgeable, Wealthfront are targeting clients that have traditionally been shut out of the advisory space - they do not meet the minimums - Personal Capital is directly competing with them with a similar business model.

The average balance of a Personal Capital client is about $125,000 according to my calculations based on SEC data. An advisor at Merrill Lynch or Wells Fargo (company) is about the same. Instead of building their own PFM apps, these advisors will use tools like eMoney Advisor for account aggregation or a TAMP platform such as Envestnet (company).

Thus, if you are in the accumulator phase, Personal Capital is a good choice as a digital solution vs. a traditional advisor.

*Winner: Personal Capital*

**FinTech Pyramid — Preservers**


This customer segment is going to be more income based, they are typically already in retirement, and are looking for products like annuities and health insurance. They also will tend to be more tied to the traditional brands like Charles Schwab, Merrill Lynch, Vanguard Group, etc, because they came of age with many of them.

This is why Schwab Intelligent Portfolios and Vanguard Personal Advisor Services will most likely be strong choices for this group. Not necessarily for the actual product offered (as of the time of this writing I do not believe either offers true retirement &amp; insurance), but because branding and trust matters with this demographic.


Remember, Schwab was founded in 1971, and Vanguard in 1975. They were the fintech disruptors of their day. From the time the Preservers have been in their 20s and 30s - like the Gen X / Gen Y generation of today - they have grown with these brands.

The brands Baby Boomers know from the 70’s remain attractive today.

This will explain why Schwab has been able to move over about $5 Billion from this demographic, while Vanguard has been able to move over about $30 Billion, since they launched their digital solutions. According to reports, 75% -80% of Schwab’s Intelligent Portfolio AUM has come from existing clients. Their average client is over 55 years old, so this proves my hypothesis. They struggle to attract new young clients, but are very solid choices for their current Baby Boomer client base.

*Tie: Charles Schwab and Vanguard Group*

**Pareto Principle - Other Segments**

I am also a strong believer in the 80/20 rule. My pyramid probably only encompasses about 80% of the market.

For the 20% of the equation there are specialized situations that drive human behavior in consumer finance and in particular in wealth management.

—-

**Bargain Hunters**

We see this “coupon” or “bargain” mentality occur a lot in the ETF space, some investors will solely look at low-cost options, and compare expense ratios of Vanguard, SsgA, Blackrock iShares, etc.

Here the competitors would be Wisebanyan and Schwab Intelligent Portfolios.

Both are no management fee, but Wisebanyan is truly no fee, Schwab is not really free when you look under the hood, as we did here -

Why does Schwab Intelligent Portfolios hold so much cash?

What is a good Schwab Intelligent Portfolios review?

In fact, we estimate that with increasing interest rates, Schwab could be making over 2% on some accounts!

WiseBanyan has done a nice job on their app design, and they have high ratings among customers in the iOS App Store.


Because of the many conflicts of interest within the Intelligent Portfolios product, I believe Wisebanyan will be the clear choice among those looking at a simple solution at no cost.

*Winner: WiseBanyan*

—-

**Tax Efficiency Hunters**

If you have a large amount of unrealized capital gains in a taxable account or are concerned with cutting down on a potentially large tax bill on an account transfer or ongoing trading, then this sub-category is for you.

Although most people will typically compare Wealthfront and Betterment (product/company) head on, I think of Wealthfront more as a tax manager and Betterment (product/company) as a UI/UX focused personal finance app.

Tax managed investing is a very lucrative industry. For example, Parametric is a leading institutional asset manager that focuses on tax optimization, and they have over $160 Billion in AUM!

When Wealthfront pivoted from Kaching (and then their original Wealthfront business model of a marketplace for actively managed portfolios) they smartly created new awareness in the industry for Tax Loss Harvesting. This technique has been used for decades by advisors, but was never optimized for the scale that Wealthfront operated on. They obviously hit a nerve in the market, especially from high earning Silicon Valley workers, because since they brought this to the forefront in their marketing, it has become “table stakes”. Every robo is expected to offer it, and Wealthfront can be credited with this.

Below, is what Wealthfront claims is the returns from their TLH strategy (until August 2014).


Wealthfront also does tax-efficient transfers of securities. Again, if a client has a large amount of realized gains in a taxable portfolio it becomes difficult to sell them. If you go to Wealthfront, they claim to sell them in a tax efficient manner, waiting for some legacy securities to become long-term gains, etc.

Introducing Tax-Minimized Brokerage Account Transfers » Wealthfront Knowledge Center

For these reasons, I would say Wealthfront is the leader in this niche part of the market so far.

*Winner: Wealthfront*

—-

**Service Hunters**

This niche will cut across demographic lines. Some consumer finance shoppers are most interested in the breadth of customer service.

Personal Capital and Vanguard Group approach to support is to provide a human advisor that you can chat with. So, if your only concern would be that you want to talk to someone about your account via a video portal then these would be good choices. Below, I show the video portal from Vanguard PAS -


Some people (like myself, who has never walked into a bank branch and hates talking on the phone) are looking for a more digital/tech look and feel. On the more digital side I believe Hedgeable has the most robust service, which is 7 day text messaging, live chat, support ticketing, phone, CIO office hours, digital consultations, email, and soon chatbots.

Betterment (product/company) would be a close second, they also offer 7 day chat and phone service and they get good reviews from customers on service. Although, I am writing this in the afternoon on a weekend and Betterment’s chat is offline (see below), even though the chat hours say it should’t be -


Some platforms just aren’t selling service and that is fine - sometimes people just want to go to an automat (remember those?!) versus a sit down restaurant. For example, Wealthfront doesn’t even offer a live chat feature, but that is purposeful (I assume), since they are trying to build more of a TurboTax (product) low service model.


I cannot pick a best of this sub-category, because it really depends on what kind of support is important to you - an advisor via video chat or a fully digital experience.

*Winner: Depends on service type wanted*

**Conclusion Part I**

The wealth management market is very complex, there is never going to be a one size fits all solution for everyone. Therefore I suggest the following two steps -

Determine where you stand on the FinTech Pyramid
Below I created a graphic based on the levels of the pyramid and my selections in each:


Once you have determined where you fit in the pyramid (there will be some overlap in age, thus I took off the ages in some of the levels), it will help to narrow down the “best” selection for you and your circumstances.

Determine if the 20% rule applies to you
If so, the pyramid isn’t going to be applicable, and you can look across the spectrum for a solution. This accounts for why about 80%-85% of most robos’ demographics fall within the same age range, but 15%-20% do not. There are many more categories, but I focused on just three in my analysis.


**Conclusion Part II**

A shopper that is best suited for a Hyundai (car company) is probably not going to be hanging out at the Tesla Motors (company) dealership and someone in a hurry on game day is probably not going to trade in their Papa John's Pizza order for an hour adventure at Outback Steakhouse.

Many of the answers here will point out a clear winner, but that is because they fall in a certain part of this pyramid, and they are looking myopically at the market from their own eyes. Thus, they are not even mentioning some key players in the space, that aren’t targeting their demographic. There is no way a firm can be best for everyone, and I don’t believe anyone tries to be. This is a common miss-conception in Financial Technology.

Just look at the infographic I made below. This shows data from a Citi survey, on the expected rise of robo assets over the next 10 years. Much like the ETF market, this space will be fragmented, with “best” in class equivalents of Vanguard, SSgA, WisdomTree, GlobalX, etc. Or if you want to look at it like the trading market, an options trader certainly wouldn’t think Robinhood (Brokerage) is “best” because they don’t even offer that service, even though millions of 20 somethings might love it!

There is nothing wrong with any of the players in the market, it depends on what is important to you at a particular stage in life. Happy investing!

1) seres therapeutics MCRB is having p2 data. This is very important, there has been massive insider selling following incredibly good p1 data. So the stock has been torn between the clinical trial phenomenal data and the really nasty insider selling. If you want a full recap altumresearch has our summary article on seeking alpha http://seekingalpha.com/article/3962932-seres-therapeutics-need-know-will-first-prescription-microbiome-company
 but here's the tl;dr:
The company takes the intestinal gut bacteria from healthy individuals, and filters them out for a concoction of just a handful of bacteria that are conserved in healthy individuals. They then put this in a pill and if you're suffering from serious gut bacteria infections (*c.diff* which kills 20,000 people a year), your cured... 29/30 at least in the p1.
P2 data any day. With the Nestlé collaboration, I used to think they were too expensive to get bought out but I don't think so anymore.

2) Scynexis $Scyx is a company releasing a p2 again, here's our more in depth article http://seekingalpha.com/article/3986354-scynexis-proven-drug-much-needed-market-analysis .
Tl; dr the company is making a new anti fungal medicine that seems to be about as effective as the standard of care but, in many cases will be effective when the final infection becomes resistance to the standard of care. The kicker is that this thing is orally active, where other similar drugs are necessarily IV. There's a lot of market potential for the drug depending on how they design their P3s but be careful to buy before the p2 as outlined in the article. Buy out target of they show equal to or better than standard of care in upcoming p2.

3) CytRx or $cytr. P3 results as soon as Monday. Jesus Christ if you talk about cytr in any bearish manner on stocktwits or Yahoo message boards be prepared for full on autistic hate. They are a relentless group and I think it's because very few of them are intelligent or understand science. There are a sudden splurge of cytr articles this past week, and I have an inclination they have been paid for by cytr, since cytr gas done this in the past and got a small also on the wrist.

Anyway, we again have an article on them, but the basics are the drug seems to perform as good as the standard of care, but it has no cardiotoxicity which is very good. I believe, with all the data I've seen, that they are basically able to deliver doxorubicin to the body in much higher quantities and somehow it avoids cardiotoxic events. There are usually more AEs associated with cytr drug versus the standard though (other than cardiotoxic). It's iffy but I think the company is going to get away with their p3 being a success. I think PDUFA will destroy them though.

4) RIGL or Rigel therapeutics has a P3 by mid July and it's interesting. For an autoimmune disease that targets platelets and blood cells. They shut down a MASTER REGULATOR of immune response and show decent results in previous trials. The problem is in caps. I have a feeling it's doing to be extremely effective in proving it works but I am curious if it will work too well and people will end up developing serious infections or die from the flu, etc.

I'm playing MCRB with half my portfolio.
I'm waiting until after p2 to buy some long term scyx.
I'm holding about $100 in cytr for yolo
I'm not holding RIGL

16-07-11,4s9qk7,"This Weeks Game Plan In The Stock Market: Prepare For Earnings, Fed Speak","The week ahead promises to be volatile. With the stock market near all-time highs, the markets have shrugged off worries about Federal Reserve rate hikes, economic signals of weakness and Brexit. So what happens now? Is the all clear given for new all-time highs?
This week we will begin earnings season. The first big name company to report will be Monday after the market closes. Alcoa Inc (NYSE:AA) will report earnings, and economists will be looking for signals of growth or lack their of, in the aluminum industry. This could tell investors if a global slowdown is getting worse or easing. The consensus estimates are for $0.09 per share on $5.20 billion in revenue.
The rest of the week will mainly be devoted to financial stocks. Banks such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) and Wells Fargo &amp; Co (NYSE:WFC) will report. Investors will be looking closely at these reports to decipher how much of an impact low rates are having on their earning potential. The 10 year yield closed on Friday at 1.358%. After Dodd-Frank was passed, banks are much mor reliant on higher interest rates to increase profits. In addition, look for comments from CEO's like JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon on the future of the global economy. The markets always pay attention to his remarks.

Lastly, there are many Federal Reserve presidents set to speak this week. After the Non Farm Payrolls Report showed a monster increase in jobs in June of 287,000, investors will be watching to see if the Fed President's tones have shifted to hawkish. Could interest rate hikes be back on the table for later in 2016?",7

16-07-11,4s9v89,"Fellow redditors, Here's my take on Brexit referendum","The fallout of the UK’s decision to leave the EU has been pretty monumental so far – both politically and economically. I’ve been thinking about what it means for investors. Here are my conclusions:


1. **Humans are fallible**-It’s obvious, I know. Yet, this fallibility takes us by surprise again and again.  In the run up to the referendum the markets were stable, even on the day of the vote the pound and the FTSE performed well. Traders simply didn’t consider that the UK would actually vote to leave. Why would they? From their perspective, the country was overwhelmingly in favour of staying – as was the case in London, however their isolation from other sectors of British society meant they completely misjudged the mood of much of the country.

2. **Black Swan events happen**- Some financial experts are describing the Brexit aftermath as a Black Swan event, much like the Lehman crisis in 2008 which also shook markets. 
The immediate fall-out was devastating, $2 trillion wiped off world markets and the pound plummeted to a 31 year low (and continues to struggle). 

3. **Risk management is key**-
Although markets bounced back to relative stability, the pound is still low and the period ahead likely to be volatile and uncertain. Diversifying investments, in particular to include those which don’t follow market trends is a good way to mitigate risks during such periods. Gold is a favourite with investors and indeed wine is increasing in popularity. Some hedge funds made serious gains from Brexit, good news for the super wealthy, however, even robo-adviser newcomer invest.com which is seeks to democratise hedge fund investing succeeded in turning loss into profit. 


4. **Knowledge and experience make all the difference**-
If you were watching the news as the Brexit votes were announced you may have picked up the looks of panic on the young finance reporters faces, they reminded me of the first market crash I experienced. Despite the risks involved, investing is still the best way to make money grow in the long run. What is more technology is making quality and risk considered investing more accessible with the introduction of robo advisers to the industry. 
In short, keep investing, but be aware of the risks and do what you can to protect yourself, including getting expert advice and diversifying your investments.

""You will be eligible to participate in the company's stock option program, subject to approval by the board of directors.

So the first part is easy to understand, the option will be there to purchase the stocks at their market value but the confusing part is the vesting? the 25% at the one year anniversary then ratably at 2.083% per month thereafter for 36 months.

I like IBM for Watson cog and I feel like they are just making good choices that will give them a competitive advantage in the long run. For example they purchased the Weather company and they are trying to feed all that weather data into Watson to help predict the weather more accurately. Now I was just at the airport and my plane was delayed for 12 hours and then cancelled because of bad weather. If IBM figures that out they can help airports better prepare for storms like that so last minute delays aren't an issue. 

I realize they have hardware sales constantly dropping and this offsets the growth from their 'strategic imperatives', but at some point they will hit a growth phase and I see that continuing. 

HPE - they are already in the growth phase...they don't have a hardware segment that's eating at their profits like cisco or ibm. They are also planning a merger with CSC which I don't know much about but seems promising from what I read.  

What I don't like is that the CTO working on 'the machine' is leaving at the end of the year. For those that don't know this machine is supposed to revolutionize the way data centers operate. The fact that the main lead on the project is leaving doesn't show much confidence in it's success. 

 Cisco - I have done much less research but they seem similar to IBM but without the ruthlessness to lose the dead-weight and a future competitive advantage other then the hardware know how for IoT switches(which I believe have been dropping in sales) but they also have a large cash horde so....idk. 

This is what I think ..IBM has longer history and I feel like once they are finished with this transformation they will hit high speed growth and see a massive jump in share price. I think that may be a little longer away, where as HPE I think will start seeing growth in the short run and kind of dwindle away as they don't seem to have any distinct advantages over IBM as far as I can tell, unless this machine turns out to be legit. 

These are all my opinions and I'm no expert so feel free to tear my theories apart lol what do you all think? I think if I had to rank them by my favorite it would be ibm &gt; cisco &gt; hpe",3

But does it really compare to managing investments directly?","I remembered the Acorns app from an old television commercial and thought it was just a savings app. I planned to invest the money I saved with it. However, when I downloaded it to check it out, I discovered that it actually invests the money. 

The app seems very focused on simplicity rather than control, and it's tough to tell right away how they're making money on my money. I can find out what stocks I own if I bother to try, but the app seems to take a ""leave it to us"" approach. For example, they offer different profiles but they won't allow me to make my own. None the less, I am capable of reviewing the stocks I am invested in via Acorns and verifying the profit they claim I have made. 

Despite being wary of such a ""leave it to us"" process, I have made nearly 2% in a week (with a high risk portfolio). Money is money, so it seems like a legitimate way to invest some spare change, but maybe I am being naive about this. Is Acorns really a good way to invest?",0

And in trying to list them, I was curious as to what you guys believe the future holds, if you agree and possibly if you could shed some light on the areas I haven't considered.

I see a massive push towards renewable energy. People are calling Tesla's move on SolarCity a wash because it has no benefit. I disagree as I saw a similar argument being presented when Netflix said they were splitting their company and look how well that turned out for them.

Another area I see potential growth in is these AR/VR market segments. If GO is any indication what lies beyond the frontier of the mobile platforms true potential, the next couple years are going to send your head spinning. With this speculation in mind, I have considered 4k resolution cameras for future generation mobile devices, along with semiconductor manufactures, is there another area I should be looking into to capitalize on this upward trend?

With that in mind, I've started to look into optical transistors. From my understanding, this is the technology that will and quite possibly already has started to supersede fiber optics. Some are speculating this discovery will pave the way for quantum computing, as well as fast-as-light communication(no downloads, instantaneous streaming, no buffers, etc) However, most companies I've considered in this field, are either still in the R&amp;D phase or are in the process of buying smaller manufactures to make the transition when the time presents itself. I could be wrong, but this is one of the reasons why I believe it's taking Google as long as it has to roll out their fiber network but who knows, maybe there's more red-tape than I can comprehend. So given this area of technology will upend our current computing standards, am I better off looking at the big dogs like Sony, Samsung, Google, and other titans-- or, in the off chance, they aren't ready for this developed tech, should I follow these R&amp;D firms hoping to sign off on some larger than life partnership?

Lastly, I believe there is something interesting going on in the vein of pharmaceuticals, however, the industry is already well established. Although, with the legalization of marijuana and the pursued research in alternative medicines(ie LSD), I can't help but wonder what type of cures will come from such interests. I've also found a hard time locating the companies along the frontier of this directive, mainly because a lot of their press releases are medical mumbo-jumbo that sails over my head.

Anyway, to wrap this up, what do you guys think? Have I lost my mind? Am I onto something? What do you all believe?",3

16-07-11,4sd413,Is there a gold bubble?,"Now, this may sound stupid. I'm a college student and I've still got a lot to learn. But yesterday I was watching a movie called Boom Bust Boom (great movie btw) and it got me to thinking of what possible bubbles could exist at the moment.

My honest opinion is that the economy is being propped up and we are a lot more fragile than the fed, media, etc. are making us out to be. Obviously many others believe the same/something similar so they flocked to safer assets like treasuries and gold. The fact that gold has risen by well over 100% year to date has me feeling like if there was a bubble developing in the U.S. economy, it'd be gold. Not just because it's risen so high but because it's risen so quickly. 

Could this be possible? Like I said I'm only in college so I'm not sure how a commodity bubble would work since I don't believe I've consciously experienced one. Is it different because borrowing money to buy gold isn't very common? Or maybe it is. I'm not sure.

Either way, I believe we are in some sort of bubble since the markets are overvalued and the amount of consumer (and overall) debt in the U.S. is way too high to be considered healthy imo.",0

* I have closed my VRX short position at a small loss in order to make this trade.

* I will now try to slowly grind back to money I lost. This means smaller position and risk.

* AAPL will crash massively after its earnings release date on July 26th. It almost always crash anyway and this quarter in particular will be terrible.

* It almost pains me to do that, but it must be done.

* Apple is still a solid company, but short-term, it has many challenges it cannot quickly adapt too.

* Apple is about to have the worst quarter in years. iPhone sales are down. iPad are still going down. 

* The USD is too strong and their hedges rolled off. Also, Apple had a lot of its cash in GBP. They are going to have a terrible earnings release.

* Apple has nothing to bring to the table. The watch is a failure.  iPhone have plateaued. The 7 might restart it but that's several months from now.

* All this to say, this quarter's earnings will be terrible and have not been fully priced in the stock price.

* I have to decided to sell ITM call because a) I will gain money from time decay b) I will gain money from volatility crush c) Apple should crash 4-5% post-earnings, making the calls OOM and thus, I keep the entire premium.

Apple seems like a sure short right now, if only for the post-earnings pullback and weak momemtum. I am going to enter such trades in the future to slowly rebuild my capital.

16-07-11,4sc0ut,"Pokemon GO($NTDOY): Why you should buy &amp; hold","Hi,  
  
I noticed a lot of bear-ish comments on WSB about Nintendo and Pokemon GO. Here's why I think you should buy and hold... at least for a few weeks:  
  
* The hype is immense - There are tons of memes on social media about Pokemon GO. Worldstar Hiphop is constantly shouting it out. The game is very popular in areas that 1. use a lot of social media and 2. take good advantage of the game and it's setting. As I typed this list out, at least 3 other positive news articles have been released on TradingView. Hell, Emily Sears(a very popular model) was even shouting it out on her Snapchat story yesterday. Hype of this sort(generally) leads to positive expectations about the future of the game.  
  
* Pokemon GO appeals to children(a great target audience) and to people who have played previous Pokemon titles.   
  
* Micro-transactions and future sales of Pokemon games. The former is more important than the latter; do you really think people are going to constantly have time to visit ""Pokestops"" to collect freebies? I don't. This could go in both directions - players may leave instead of spending more. GO could also increase sales of Nintendo equipment.  
  
* Issues with old Pokemon games - People who have played previous Pokemon titles may remember walking through specific areas to find Pokemon. You'd have to stare at the screen and walk through grass until you find one. While this was a core element of gameplay, it was an outdated one, forcing you to live through some of the most boring parts of Pokemon. Walking around in real time to find Pokemon innovates this concept and is undoubtedly a more attractive option.  
  
* The app is still unreleased in many areas. At the time of typing this, it's still unavailable in the Google Play Store. In Canada. I obtained my copy through a special link. The full international potential has not yet been realized.  

* Pokemon branding in a mobile game market.  
  
There are some weaknesses that could lead to stock to fall:  
  
* The game is casual and who knows what updates will be released for it. This could effectively have the stock on life support.  
  
* Accidents and catastrophes. Usually these are classified under unexpected events, but due to the nature of Pokemon GO(having the phone open at all times, having to keep a close eye on your screen, having rare chances of catching Pokemon at the wrong place, wrong time) lead to decreased awareness in the surroundings. Which further could lead to the game being hit with penalties.   
  
My personal opinion? Buy, hold, and keep a close eye on the news. The hype and the fact that Pokemon GO has not reached it's full potential, coupled with the Pokemon brand and the mobile market, means it's likely to continue as a bull. There are some half-expected issues with the game but that can be remedied with keeping your eye triggered on the news.",5

I think institutional buying has begun on this bitch (the reason CRC wanted it's recent reverse split to happen for). They're doing their part and just recently presented this:

I don't know how to read big words, but the pdf has pretty graphs and I was impressed with how much cum they've been able to recover, [9 cums. Wow.](http://imgur.com/uqhGxKT). Fantastic recovery rate.

Either way the conference must have liked what it saw. The timing of this volume arriving matches up for these guys to get home from that ""conference"" and masturbate over $CRC with their chart people and other hedge fund office people who like to masturbate too. Then they do some buying while again, masturbating.

The last few days the price has only reacted to the positive swings in oil... I think there's big money flowing in that's bullish (buying any weakness/not selling). The price of crude ate shit today, but this one hasn't budged... as well I've been noticing that the chart has completely diverged from the other energy stocks that it normally tracks along side of (*$WLL $CHK*).

I'm gay for volume, block trades, divergence and irregular activity.

Several redditors have noticed a sharp rise in BP's stock since Brexit! Does that matter? Given the dollar nature of the oil business, I doubt it, though a $ sales £ costs business is on the right side of the Brexit trade.

In fact for me the key question I'd like answered is around dividend sustainability.

# Description
BP p.l.c. is an integrated oil and gas company. No much more to say! Though worth noting that the company owns 20% of Rosneft one of the largest oil companies in Russia.

## Recent financials 

Anything but exciting both in terms of sales and profitability.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $223bn | $354bn | $379bn | $376bn | $376bn|
|EPS | -$0.35 | $0.20 | $1.23 | $0.58 | $1.32|

But to put that in perspective here's Exxon's latest figures. Rather a lot more impressive, really.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $259bn | $394bn | $421bn | $452bn | $467bn|
|EPS | $3.85 | $7.60 | $7.37 | $9.70 | $8.42|

## Competition
BP is mute on competition in its SEC 20K so here's the commentary of Exxon

&gt; The energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive. There is competition within the industries and also with other industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of both industrial and individual consumers. 

So not only are BP, XOM and the boys at each others throats, they've got to worry about solar, nuclear, etc.

Looking at it's size, last 12 months, things are still in reverse. Margins are at the bottom of the pack and returns negative. Generally a poor comparison to the other majors.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
BP plc (ADR) | $207,210M | 8% | -ve
Chevron Corporation | $120,308M | 14% | 1%
China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corp (ADR) | $292,238M | 8% | 5%
Eni SpA (ADR) | $66,433M | 16% | -ve
Exxon Mobil Corporation | $241,835M | 11% | 8%
PetroChina Company Limited (ADR) | $300,042M | 15% | 5%
Royal Dutch Shell plc (ADR) | $247,808M | 11% | -ve
Total SA (ADR) | $133,980M | 20% | 4%

BP plc (ADR) has $30,815M of net debt. That is 1.8x it's latest operating profit. Nothing hideous... but watch out, dividends are higher than earnings, so with debts of $31bn can they really sustain a higher divie that profits?

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $35.56 for BP plc (ADR) and their recommendation to clients is *Buy*. That implies an upside of -1% to their target. So rather a mockery of the idea of price targets. 

# Valuation
The following table shows the key valuation metrics. With earnings this high, I can't but feel that the current EPS isn't a good reflection of future cashflows. So *boring* large cash cows like oils, who are cutting cutting on capex and just pumping what they've got, the EPS looks depressed. And the FCF yields look a lot more reasonable, as a result.

Though again, Wall Street's hardly showering itself in glory maintaining double digit long-term growth forecasts for many of the majors.

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/bp/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
BP | $110,793M | 29x | 23% | 7% | 10%
CVX | $197,460M | 87x | 40% | 4% | 16%
SNP | $85,606M | 14x | 2% | 4% | 31%
E | $58,276M | 13x | N/A | 4% | 5%
XOM | $387,874M | 34x | 27% | 3% | 11%
PTR | $189,739M | 29x | 41% | 1% | N/A
RDSA | $221,207M | 23x | 20% | 7% | 28%
TOT | $118,064M | 15x | -3% | 5% | 24%

# Dividends
BP plc (ADR) is forecast to pay a dividend of $2.34 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $1.80 per share. That is a 30% growth. But way above the current forecast of an EPS of $1.23. Worries me that.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 19% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 26%. So the performance has all been driven by earnings upgrades. So it's all about their ability to:
* ride the oil price
* show they are aggressively cutting capex
* give comfort that their 7% divie is sustainable 

Anything else that could boost it? Or trash it?

* Current REITs and Utilities are yielding ~4% dividends.  [REITs](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0123&amp;FundIntExt=INT) are up 15.49% and [Utilities](https://www.google.com/finance?catid=TRBC%3A59&amp;ei=XxOEV6jmH-3wiQKp2IGwAg) are up 14.91% for a year (Jul 13, 2015 - Jul 11, 2016) vs S&amp;P 500's 1.08% in the same time period.
* If Interest Rates increase, REITs yield will increase as most REITs will have secured a 5-10 year term loan and there will be a corresponding increase in rents (lest any calamity in the market occurs).  
* Utilities will suffer as mid market and capital market companies have variable rates.

16-07-11,4se0bn,Did I make a mistake creating a taxable account.,"Background: I'm 27, and about a year ago I got a job making 34k. I expect to be promoted to a salary of around 45k in less than a year. Unfortunately I got into the workforce late and didn't start working until after college. My first job was full time with and Walmart that didn't allow for much savings so I pretty much started saving for real when I hit this salary bump a year ago. Around the time I got the salary bump I moved back in with parents to cut expenses and I've saved up around 1k a month. I definitely haven't been as frugal as I  could have been, but I also could be a lot worse. I will be moving out into my own place in August cutting my savings to about 400-500 a month until I get a new salary bump.

I have zero outstanding debt and own a reliable car valued around 5k.

Current savings:
2k in employer 401k (just opened my first 401k last December :( ) 
7.2k in a 3 fund Vanguard taxable brokerage account with the following allocation: 25% vxus, 35% BND, 40% VTI.
4k in a 1% savings acciunt.

The question: I made this taxable brokerage account in March thinking it would be a good way to save for a house / condo down payment (5-10 year time horizon at this point, depends on salary increases and whether I meet a S.O.). Is this foolish? I see everywhere to max your Roth IRA after employer match, but I feel that if I maxed a Roth out, that would leave me with very minimal savings towards a down payment. I really don't want to rent forever. 
I see three choices:
A. Hold the taxable account as is, potentially add to it from my savings if the market takes a plunge. 
B. Liquidate taxable account and create a Roth with vanguard, hold extra money in 1% savings.
C. Liquidate taxable account account and put 10k in a 5 year CD since my time horizon may be as short as 5 years and my investment is too risky.

16-07-12,4sg4wt,GoPro Earnings DD,"This may be a gimme, but I just completed my Estimize on GoPro, so I thought I'd share.  

GoPro is expected to report earnings next Tuesday on 7/19/16.  Can't verify the date, as GPRO hasn't announced yet when they will report.

Somehow, GoPro staged a rally yesterday.  You've probably read the news about it being related to VR and augmented reality in response to the Pokemon Go phenom, or just normal volatility (IMO, the talking heads have no idea why it went up and any of these were as good a reason as any).


GoPro claims, as of their last earnings report, they will still meet the guidance they gave in February of $1.3-$1.5B in revenue for the year.

In order to meet that target, they need another year like 2014.  $600M+ in revenue in the 4th quarter and a pretty good 3rd quarter, and even then, I think they'd only reach the bottom guidance.


Best case for the bulls, they have an ok quarter, and keep to the party line with their guidance, hoping they will pull out a miracle with the Hero 5 and the Karma.  That way, they'll squeeze out another quarter with the stock hovering around $11-$12.


Best case for the bears.  They don't meet expectations for the quarter, and guide lower forward (obviously).  Stock below $9 (like 5 days after earnings last quarter).

However, if they don't guide lower, consistent with last quarter, I think, it will be harder for investors to believe that they will really meet $1.3B in revenue, though it can't be discounted.  Looking for $10-11.

I am going to be buying $12 puts for GoPro, July 29 expiration.  Should be a ~50% return if they hit $11* on July 20.  Anything lower and it will be triple digit returns.  I may wait a couple days and hope the price holds to get a lower price on the puts, or step into them, and wait til closer to earnings to hedge with some calls, but I just can't see why this stock jumped today and expect it to return to the average of the last couple months.

Warning:  Estimize consensus, however, is higher than wall street estimates (unbelievable to me, but there you go), and short interest is high (26%) so there's a chance for a rally if they beat slightly and give the same guidance as before.

I will also admit, I pulled the price estimates from my ass based on the price GPRO was at after earnings last quarter.  It has been my experience (4 months at least playing on here), that stocks tend to trend towards the last stock price they were at when earnings were last reported, unless there is significant upward revisions to guidance (looking at you NVDA).  There hasn't been.  Last quarter after earnings, it was around 10.50.


There you go people (can't really call you gentlemen, can I?), tear it up...

Edited gain/loss at $11, not $12, because I am an idiot.

16-07-12,4sg5lv,Nintendo MOON Flight has just began,"Crystal ball says Nintendo is going to $36+ today and moon from there. These last few days have been the most profitable in the history of the company -- and the show just started. 

2:30am DD, here you go faggots 


The **Bad:**

-Nintendo doesn't own the game. Niantic does; a privately traded company. While Nintendo profits from the Pokemon brand name, I'm not certain they will directly profit from in-app purchases and similar revenues. 

-[Nintendo only owns about a third of the Pokemon brand name, though they do profit the most from it.]( http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2016/07/11/will-pokemon-go-be-the-nintendo-cash-cow-investors-are-hoping-for/#7ef201875926)

-The game has huge potential to become a fad. I believe this factor hinges solely on whether or not Niantic re-introduces the old combat system; because the new one is shitty.

-People will die playing this game. Media will blow it out of proportion and it could potentially hurt the SP. *On a side note I'm willing to Yolo that somebody dies within a month in a Pokemon GO-related accident.* 





&amp; the overwhelmingly **Good:**

-[Pokemon GO is already bigger than Twitter or Tinder in the US. It has only been out for a week.](http://www.businessinsider.com/pokmon-gobigger-than-tinder-overtake-twitter-similarweb-data-stock-price-nintendo-niantic-2016-7)

-[Niantic says they're going to implement trading with other players.](http://www.businessinsider.com/pokmon-go-will-get-pokmon-trading-2016-7) This was wildly requested and highly important to the longevity of the game. It also shows that the company is willing to make critical updates.

-The 5-day chart looks like a staircase to the moon. Absolute Yolo material. 

-[Pokemon GO hasn't even been released in Europe or Canada yet, as well as most other places.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2016/07/07/uk-europe-south-america-when-will-pokemon-go-launch-in-canada-and-the-rest-of-the-world/#1abd3e0849ad)

16-07-12,4ses21,Small cap stock with little to no information available,"The stock I'm referring to is $SGY.

For no particular reason than buying on an upswing I decided to pick up a small amount of shares of this stock a few weeks back when it was around $7.15. Today, including after hours trading it is sitting at about $18.30. This stock shoots up anywhere from 10-20% daily and is trading at a much higher rate than normal.  

Most of you I would assume haven't been following this stock. The articles I have been able to find from March were forewarning of possible bankruptcy. Since then the company did a reverse split 1:10 to stay listed on the exchange as well as restructure a contract deal and paid off some debt early.  

This stock is a little more terrifying to me than normal just due to the lack of information coming out. The last three weeks I think it has had a total of 3 negative days, two during the Brexit (36 and 3  cents) and one after the 4th of July where it dropped around $1.30.  

I've been attempting to use historical oil pricing data to try and get any sort of grasp on where this thing could be headed since there really isn't anything else out there.  

May 2008 crude = $139.45  
SGY = $61.30 (adjusting for split $613.00)  

January 2009 crude = $46.86  
SGY = $10.99 (adjusting for split $109.90)  

May 2015 crude = $60.07  
SGY = $16.87 (adjusting for split $168.70)  

Right now if you adjusted for the split the stock would be at $1.83. There are many other factors that determine a stocks price, but due to the lack of information, is it even reasonable to assume this stock has the potential to reach $30+ with crude and NG continuing to hover around ~$45-50 and $3 respectively?",3
16-07-12,4setmv,Twitter Earnings Play. The Socialist SWHC. DD Inside,"**TL;DR: Gun Violence is a leading indicator for TWTR monthly active users, because people live tweet at riots and people love getting their news unfiltered from schmucks on the street. it's been a quarter for gun stocks to rise because of all the riots. Twitter is going to be the culmination of that with a huge bump in their monthly active users.**  

  
&amp;nbsp;
  
OK we know SWHC shareholder's American Dream of cops executing detained suspects and getting themselves sniped. Or people living their favorite GTA mission at gay nightclubs and mental health facilities.    
  
But that got me thinking, there's gotta be a less risky way to profit off people shooting each other. I'm not a put it in RGR and wait for the terrorists, rioters, or cops to get on TV for murdering a group of people. Those shootings are like monthly black swans.  In completly un WSB type fashion, I'm looking for a little more stability. Im looking for an earnings play.   
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
Something like Twitter's Earnings.    
Why? Cause Jack Dorsey told us how to value twitter:
  
&amp;nbsp;  

*In twitters first 10-K, they told investors about their forward looking statements on Pg 1. The 2 of the first four forward looking statements are:*
	
**1.) our ability to attract and retain users and increase the level of engagement of our users;**  

2.) our expectations regarding our user growth rate and the usage of our mobile applications    
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
*In Twitter's most recent 10-K they decided they were looking for*

**1.) our ability to attract and retain users and increase the level of engagement of our users;**  
   
**2.) our business strategies, plans and priorities, including our plans for growth and refinement of our core service;**  
 
**3.) our expectations regarding our user growth rate and the continued usage of our mobile applications;**  
 
&amp;nbsp;  
  
Look at that bold shit. Twitter wants investors to believe that the number one thing to look at is their ability to attract and retain users. And continued usage of their mobile service is pretty fucking important too. Fuck that presidential debate and fuck whatever random weekday football they live stream, it's all about tweets and retweets on a monthly basis. Thank god there's been biweekly riots and shootings this quarter.    
  
Well, when do people use twitter? When they wanna see live fucked up news. Like Sniped Cops. Or Dead Gays. Or Dead Crazies. Or Dead Black men.   
  
When gun nuts are busy buying SWHC and counting their ammo, techie hipsters will be live tweeting the chaos and millennials will be watching that shit on their couch while they hit the bong and wonder when it's time to vote for bernie sanders. They population will be engaging with twitter.   
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
**The Play**

sell if you can.  the longer they delay releasing their numbers, the more likely it is that they won't

I don't think they will release poor numbers (since they don't always release them).  so in this case, no news is bad news and if you're green it may not be worth the risk

ER is coming up at the end of month and we may see a better entry point before ER with gold as volatile as it is lately

Analysts as a whole have had mixed reviews on their future.  These upcoming earnings are an important check-point on their road to predicted profitability.

In the near past, earnings differing from consensus have had some pretty big moves for AMD. 

The chart is tightening up from its run-up while we approach earnings, people are taking a lot of positions on each side with high than usual average volume while basically going sideways.  That means a lot of shorts to cover and a lot of stop-loss triggers to pull from an earnings surprise on either direction.

If you can get a fair enough priced long volatility spread (strangle, straddle, etc.) for Aug, it may be worth it.  Short call butterfly spread would be better if there were some damn volume in OTM options to help finance it, but there's not right now.

Worst-case is their in-line and you sell the spread back at a slight loss.

Thanks for any advice you all can give me. I inherited an IRA from a family member, and rolled it over to Vanguard. It wasn't a pile of money - $18k - but I'd like to invest it effectively. I'm required to take annual RMD's (I'm 31), but other than that I'd just like to reinvest the dividends and let it grow.

I currently have ~$12k in VTSAX and ~$3k in VBMFX. I'd like to put the remaining $3k into an international index fund for a little more diversification. But I'm not sure which fund is the best for me. My research steers me towards either VGTSX or VFWIX for full exposure. But I'm also interested in either VEIEX or VFSVX- they're more volatile, but seem to have the chance for much greater returns down the road.

I'm willing to accept quite a bit of risk with this- this is separate from my 401k and Roth, so it's almost play money. I could only see myself withdrawing it in an absolute emergency, so I'd just like to let it effectively grow. Any suggestions on what would be the best fund to chose?",0

Okay so I just started work at a mid sized public company in the finance industry in their back office. I recently got into investing and purchased two securities on two separate occasions while at work. Both times I purchased one share of two separate companies unrelated to the company I work for. It wasn't until later did I realize that it may have been against company policy to place any kind of trade during working hours. My question is, what should I do? Should I contact compliance? Or are the chances of getting caught slim in this case? Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.

16-07-12,4shnr3,Significant Gold pullback - Be watching for entry,"Gents if you've paid any attention to precious metals then you know they're the safe-haven for investors fearful of instability. 

Right now we have gold at a significant pullback from prices of the last several weeks (XAUUSD under 1,340/oz at this writing) and as such the rocket-ship-like ETFS of NUGT/JNUG are discounted. Taking into account their recent surge in popularity &amp; trade volume, I believe they are due for further growth going into the fall.

To buy in I'm looking for sustained prices of

~~- &lt;$160 NUGT~~

~~- &lt;$290 JNUG~~


~~You won't see NUGT under 150 unless we have a rate hike or an extremely hawkish fed statement, for JNUG I believe the floor to be around 270.~~ If stocks keep performing we may see a continued slump in gold but I don't think it will last. Especially with the highly contested US general election in November, I'm expecting to see tremendous market turmoil and instability (leading to a further flight to bonds/precious metals).  

**Edit: 12:30pm**
**Gold is about to drop under $1,330**. Based on the shift in gold price I'm expecting NUGT to touch around $145 unless gold stabilizes. 

Updated price targets to buy in:

 - NUGT $150

 - JNUG $270

**Edit: 3:30**
Gold has stabilized north of $1,330 and I expect NUGT/JNUG will not fall much further. NUGT is currently right around $149 and JNUG is at $266. Its up to you but this is where I'm buying in. In the grand scheme of things nothing has really changed and I expect the major stock indices to top out this week.

However the correction for United seems overdone -- Canada only accounts for only 10% of revenues while upstream oil and gas accounts for 6% and supply/demand for equipment rental is expected to rebound in 2017, driven by compelling benefits for clients and strong construction growth.
Equipment rental brings real benefits to United's business clients and with U.S. contractors increasingly reliant on rentals of equipment rather than owning or Leasing, United Rentals looks poised to benefit strongly given its leading market share.  Total construction spending is forecast to grow by 8.3% in 2016 and 6.7% in 2017.
With the stock at $68.26  and trading on a PE of 8.5 if the company can produce a surprise on the upside coupled with positive guidance it may just be what the stock price needs.

1+2 makes this a day trader as well as a ROTH IRA for you old-man-feeding-ducks-by-the-pond ""investor"". Yeah both of you.

JESUS I could write a book but let me try and **TLD;DR** it for you guys:

Phase 3 is treating people **WHO ARE CURRENTLY UNTREATABLE** for bone marrow transplant. In their phase 2 study, when they looked at a specific biomarker - peripheral blast burden (PBB) they saw that low PBB gave 50-100% RESPONSE RATE - **WHAT**? You should be saying.

And the skeptic then says, well hah, idiot, that's only if they have the biomarker of low PBB. True. 

Guess what? They can *pre-treat PBB* with hydroxy-urea and make it so all the patients are near that 50-100% response rate.

Sup.

Beyond that, that isn't even their most promising drug. Their soon to enter P2 trials with Actinab-A will have results by early 2017. Sounds far off.

Here's the deal, though. 

The company, since they need liquidity to keep chugging along (don't read between the lines you fuck) is going to continually present safety data at 25, 50, 75, and 100% enrollment as well as some pre-liminary data at 2 points along the way as well.

In other words. You don't just buy now and sit for 6-8 months for results and catalysts, you get a string of little bumps all along the way.

Nice. *Real nice*.

But for the actual data? The numbers? *The real story*? You'll have to wait until I write this saucy boy up - but boy I haven't been this excited to write something in a while. *A long while*

16-07-12,4sjy9d,Is a company allowed to do this?,"After reading about the firms that got fined because they only offered/essentially forced their employees into their own funds in their 401k, it made me curious about my previous employer. It was a financial firm, and do to ""security reasons"" we were only allowed to have brokerage accounts with the brokerage arm of the company. We didn't get any discounts and the fees per trade were terrible ($20 for a stock etc.) Are they allowed to do this? I know if you work for a member firm you are allowed to open up brokerage accounts elsewhere and just have to fill out a 407 letter and can have statements sent to your employer, so I feel ""security"" is a bs reason to get you to pay them more.

I recall the saying, ""be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when others are greedy"". So that makes me want to buy LEAP SPY Puts (aka short the market).

# Description
MasterCard Incorporated is a technology company that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments and businesses across the world. The Company operates through payment solutions segment. Its offerings include loyalty and reward programs, information services and consulting. The Company's services facilitate transactions on the MasterCard Network among cardholders, merchants, financial institutions and governments. 

Visa's kid brother? At $10bn of sales v Visa's $14bn it's not that little anymore. And wow has the growth been good the last 5 years.

## Recent financials 
|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $9.7bn | $9.4bn | $8.3bn | $7.4bn | $6.7bn|
|EPS | $3.35 | $3.10 | $2.56 | $2.19 | $1.48|

## Competition

It's pretty intense as they point out:

&gt; We compete in the global payments industry against all forms of payment including: (a) cash and checks; (b) card-based payments, including credit, charge, debit, ATM and prepaid products, as well as limited-use products such as private label; (c) contactless, mobile and e-commerce payments, as well as cryptocurrency; and (d) other electronic payments, including wire transfers, electronic benefits transfers, bill payments and automated clearing house payments (ACH).

In addition to the obvious competitors, every tech company, bank, or telco would like to eat their lunch. And then there is government regulation to worry about, including the occasional anti-trust lawsuit!

Of course there would be... look at $MA and $V margins.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Mastercard Inc | $9,883M | 55% | 64%
Alliance Data Systems Corporation | $6,515M | 28% | 30%
American Express Company | $34,594M | 27% | 23%
Fiserv Inc | $5,310M | 30% | 28%
Global Payments Inc | $2,858M | 22% | 36%
Paypal Holdings Inc | $9,655M | 23% | 12%
Visa Inc | $14,280M | 69% | 24%

Mastercard Inc has $3,812M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 4% of the market value of Mastercard Inc. Though I'm always a bit wary of cash figures for any business in a quasi financial services industry.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $108.34 for Mastercard Inc and their recommendation to clients is *Buy*. That implies an upside of 22% to their target. 

# Valuation
The following table shows the key valuation metrics. Now, I'm rarely a fan of businesses that are trading in the high 20s, but the growth has been good and they do seem to have *moat*. Is this a Quality purchase? Rather than Value or Growth?

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/ma/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|

# Dividends
Mastercard Inc is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.73 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $0.70 per share. That is a 4% growth. Given a EPS forecast of $3.54 it doesn't look generous.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -5% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 0%. That's against a backdrop of revenues up 10%.

For me the obvious catalysts are earnings, the global economy and the move online. All are clear positives for the giants, $MA, $V and Paypal. But these aren't really anything to write home about :( Perhaps their is international consolidation in emerging markets like China, card adoption in markets like India that can also drive growth? 

And on the downside? regulation and the tech giants? Though given how slow consumer adoption is in finance, I can't see an immediate threat on the tech front.

16-07-13,4skuwh,anti cyclic options for times when stocks are overvalued,"Hello everybody,

I am into long term indexing with Vanguard. 

Recently I have realized the US stock market is greatly overvalued (GDP to total market cap). 

So instead of sending money to the stock funds I am sending money to the money market settlement fund. I just do not feel comfortable paying for overpriced stocks.

But money market is making only 0.3% pa, so I am wondering if there is any truly anti cyclic option, that makes reasonable money.

Here are some options:
1. US treasuries. (2% pa)
2. emerging market government bonds (4.5%) for example VWOB
3. gold, which I would try to avoid since it does not return anything, its just losing money on fees. And since I cannot time the crash, the fees could add up in years.
4. keep it in money market... Zero is better then negative (0.3% pa)

What do you think about emerging market government bonds (VWOB) ? Any idea how it will perform during the next big stock correction?  The VWOB was not around during 2008, so I am not sure.

Please share your ideas about truly anti cyclic options. I do not consider consumer staples anti cyclic since they loose during the correction too, just not as bad. So they are not option.",0

16-07-13,4sncu8,Sell TELOZ at a loss now or later?,"For a couple of years TELOZ, a stock in the energy sector, would drop significantly after paying dividends and then slowly rise back.  I'm not that experienced in the stock market although I've dabbled since about 2000.  I noticed this trend after first being attracted to the high dividends they paid so I always sold immediately after dividends paid and then re-bought when it bottomed out.  Well, after a hurricane hit the gulf several years ago they had some bad losses and the stock has done nothing but drop from what I last paid ($18 in 2008) down to 14 cents today.  I own 250 shares.  At first I thought it would eventually come back so I could at least recoup some of my losses, but it never did.  Now, for the past couple of years I've held on to the stock so I could sell at the same time that I sold some other stock (possible Apple) to help offset the capital gains.

I've been wondering if this is the best strategy and if I can claim the losses even if TELOZ goes completely under.  If they do go under is there a time limit to claim the losses?",11

Do you remember a week ago when the sub was temporariy private, and the mods said they could not talk about it for legal reasons, and many of us think it could be involved with SEC? Well what a coincedence, his account first posted a week ago. Bottom line : I believe CommodityTycoon may be a SEC rep, trying to bait people into using inside information. The way his last post was set up, as if he was trying to make it obvious that he was using inside info, then saying ""PM me for my twitter handle"", that way they have you're username confirmed as trying to trade on inside info.

If you have a long-term horizon, it seems win-win (if done in moderation, of course) -- collect the premium, and then if prices do fall, you basically are getting paid to average down.

I've recently been following Timothy Sykes, the more I've learned about this person, I have come to realize he's running a scheme of pump and dumps using things like ""TimAlerts"", among other tools. What he does is he talks about a stock that is about to rise and thousands of his followers buy in on the stock, raising the value. However, he markets his services as educational; which leads to my overall question.

Where can I find these schemes and subscribe to them? I don't want to pay for TimAlerts and all that other stuff, exactly. Rather, I would like to subscribe to these nearly-illegal schemes so that I can short the pump-and-dumps. To my understanding, this seems legal as far as I can tell.

Despite the fact that investors continue buying bonds, the yield on the bonds is low. 

If the fed never raises rates, and everyone continues investing in the stock market due to lack of other options, could the stock market continue to grow to infinity? Why not?

Why is the yield on bonds low? Is it because everyone is buying them anyway, the treasury has no incentive to offer good rates of return?

16-07-13,4soe05,Finding past index data,"Hey guys and gals,

I've always been interested by optimization problems and recently found a new one to tackle: my 401k. I figured it would be a fun problem and I'd learn something, though probably won't change my allocation by that much regardless of the results. Instead of looking at past fund performance, I wanted to just look at the index funds and check their indexes, since the index by definition predates the fund. Basically my goals are:

1. Supply:
 * A list of indices and the expense ratio associated with each index
 * A volatility tolerance of some sort
 * Some time period over which to look at index performance
2. Receive
 * The ""optimal"" index fund(s) allocation over that time period within the volatility measurement
 * The performance of that allocation of other time periods
 * Some other fun statistics on that allocation

I thought this was a neat little project that wouldn't take me too long. There's a python module for Yahoo Finance. My problems lies in getting index data.

For established indices like the S&amp;P 500, it's easy enough to find tickers for total returns (SP500TR). But one of the funds available in my 401k is the Vanguard Small-Cap fund, which follows the CRSP US Small-Cap Index. I've found the ticker (CRSPSCT), but can't find historical price info. Or maybe something even more exotic, like this sub's new fascination with consumer staples (like the MSCI ASCI Consumer Staples Index, for which I had a ticker last night but can't find now). Where can I find (free?) historical data on these? Or is this something I'd have to pay some crazy amount for?

I know I could just use tickers for the ETFs or mutual funds I have access to, but again, I'd like more data than some can provide (as an arbitrary example, VIOO didn't exist until 2009).

Thanks in advance!",3

16-07-13,4sof9r,"See This Huge Sell Signal On Amazon ($AMZN), Target $600","Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is putting in the sell signal of the year. This stock has been a one way freight train, but that is about to reverse hard. Take a look at the price action in 2016. The stock is up from $475 per shares to a high yesterday of $757 per share. Just in 2016 that is a gain of almost 60%. The overbought nature of this stock is only a minor part of why it is going to be a huge sell with a target of $600. The main factor has to do with the sell signal seen on the chart in the last 24 hours. The stock rallied in the past week into Prime Day, a made up shopping holiday. Yesterday, the stock sold off on rumors that sales were not going to meet expectations. However, today good news on sales popped it back up...for a short while. This good news failed to keep the stock up, let alone take out yesterdays highs. The fact that yesterdays highs did not get breached is a sell signal of epic proportion on a stock up 60% in 2016. Investors with a technical analysis background are rushing to sell or short. If the key up-sloping trend line is broken to the downside, Amazon has little to no support until $600 (a key gap fill). This might be one of the best shorts in the stock market for the second half of 2016. You heard it here first.",0

16-07-13,4soj8n,The elephant in the room,"China...an opaque, yet gargantuan question mark in the macro arena. [REDACTED NAME], our commodities strategist, answers the question: Where has all money gone? in her new weekly publication below, China on Demand. 

We know China’s seen an explosion in capital creation in 2015, amounting to 36% of GDP, coupled with another $1 trillion of new credit injected into the economy in 1Q16, according to official statistics. Yet, unlike the experience in ’09, we haven’t seen a meaningful increase in Chinese steel demand this year. 
                                                                    
So where is the money going? Spoiler alert: credit’s at the crux of the issue— more capital has been used to pay down debt than stimulate economic activity in years past, especially as China’s leverage and debt-servicing burden skyrockets. [REDACTED] estimates that up to 10% of credit flows were deployed to service debt last year, resulting in less investment in the real economy per yuan of stimulus. 

At the same time as the potency of credit injections has declined in supercharging the economy, we would need to see an acceleration in credit growth just to maintain the same level of steel consumption…a scenario that is unstainable and unlikely. As it would take a significant deterioration in the China growth outlook to bring on another stimulus (especially after the magnitude of the 1Q program), we expect Chinese steel demand to fall in coming years. 

**Key numbers: China and Credit:**

* 200%...ratio of private non-financial debt to GDP at the end of last year, vs. 110% at the end of 2008

* 20%...debt service ratio last year as companies devote a rising share of income to repay debt vs. in 2008 when ratio was 12% 

* 14%...of outstanding debt was issued by public companies last year where their interest expenses exceeded earnings

16-07-14,4sqm38,$NOW DD,"I got interested in ServiceNow ($NOW) a few weeks ago when a friend was impressed with the work they had done at his 5B+ IT company. To sum up the DD, I think this firm is underpriced and has tons of growth potential and business opportunities in the future if it continues to be managed intelligently. 

**Who is ServiceNow?**

ServiceNow, Inc. is a provider of cloud-based solutions that define, structure, manage and automate services across the global enterprise. The Company provides cloud-based service management and business management solutions that address the needs of various departments within an enterprise, including information technology (IT), human resources (HR), facilities, field service, marketing, customer service, security, legal and finance. Its service management solutions are built on the Company's platform that also allows customers to create, by themselves or with its partners, their own service-oriented applications for use in departments across the enterprise. The Company markets its services to enterprises in a range of industries, including financial services, consumer products, IT services, healthcare and technology.

In other words, ServiceNow is increasing the efficiency of its customers by improving the speed, quality, and integration of the activities, tasks and processes that make up day-to-day work life in order to allow modern enterprise to operate faster and scale comfortably. 

**How does ServiceNow create value for its customers?**

This question is best answered by a ServiceNow report published in May titled “Today’s State of Work: The Service Experience Gap.” The report unveiled the ‘Service Experience Index’, a proprietary metric used to highlight the inefficiencies of services within corporations. Here are the 5 key findings:

1. **Popular consumer services ranked 103% better on “The Service Experience Index” compared to workplace services.** Most employees enjoy the tech perks of 2016 at home but head back to 1996 for work. 
2. **The Service Experience gap is driven by outdated technologies that sap productivity.** 69% of managers reported that manual workplace services (such as monitoring emails) left them less time for strategic initiatives, lowered their productivity, and caused stress.
3. **The companies with mostly manual services lag even farther behind those with outdated technologies.** 81% of managers reported that the manual services were delivered slowly, and only 43% of managers reported that these manual services were easy to use, compared to 79% for consumer services.
4. **Automation drove a 50% improvement in the workplace Service Experience Index, but mostly automated workplace services still contain a lot of manual work.** Injecting automation in workplace services starts to diminish the consumer services gap, however 89% of managers report that they often use email to find out the status of their service request status which is a stark contrast of typical consumer experience.
5. **Industry-specific data indicates future service improvement opportunities.** Financial services respondents were more likely to have automated processes (41% v. 32% of all top industries), however 30% of financial services firms say their workplace services are still mostly manual. Government and public sector respondents had the highest percentage of mostly manual services with 43%. The tech industry was most likely to use mobile apps to order workplace services (16% v. 5%) and least likely to use email to request services (35% v. 47%). Every industry could have their services greatly improved with automation, posing vast potential business opportunities for ServiceNow.

ServiceNow seeks to address these inefficiencies by providing models and platforms that allow their customers to define, automate, and structure their flow of work. 

**Who are ServiceNow’s competitors?**

Competitors include BMC Software, Inc. ($BMC), CA, Inc. ($CA), Hewlett-Packard Company ($HPQ, $HPE), International Business Machines Corporation ($IBM), and salesforce.com ($CRM).

**Why is ServiceNow different?**

ServiceNow’s main competitive advantage is the pricing, product functionality, breadth of offerings, security, flexibility and performance. In short, they are the dominant player in the game right now (in fact, they serve 33% of the global 2000). To top it off, all of the offerings on ServiceNow’s roster (analytics, platform, IT operations, IT services, etc) are integrated, which not only lowers cost and complexity for the customer— as everything is unified and obtained from a single provider— but also allows for a convenient opportunity to upsell. The number of multi-product customers increased from 35% in Q1 2014 to 70% in Q1 2016 and ACV has increased each year from 2010-2015 by 55-70%.

**What is ServiceNow’s anticipated revenue growth?**

ServiceNow plans to quadruple annual earnings by 2020 to 4B with plans to add security and customer service management to its roster of services. It also plans to increase its international offerings (right now 70% of revenue comes from North America). First quarter (April) results were great with an increase of 44% YoY. Expect to see higher growth second quarter given new deals and the acquisition of BrightPoint Security, ServiceNow’s first step into security services, a space with an estimated potential of $4B. 

**What are the analyst ratings?**

Strong buy, with projected reach of $102 and safety of $60. 

**What’s the play?**

Try to buy around $70. I predict that second quarter earnings should push pps past $75 at the very least. Expect around $82 for third quarter. Ability to hit reach most likely depends on management's ability to become an international player while staying competitive at home. ",39
16-07-14,4sqm4h,I sold all my Apple stock.,"I've been buying this stock all year ranging in price from $106 down to $90, average price of about $96.

I sold it all today. After analysis, I'm just not sure wtf this company is doing anymore. I've been a big fan of Apple since 2008 when I first bought my Macbook Pro, then iPhone, and pretty much everything after that.

This company is a shadow of its former self. Sure they generate tons of cash, but 90% of that is overseas. They are borrowing money to pay dividends. The company seems to get more loaded with debt by the year, which was never the case under Jobs.

I honestly don't like companies that buyback a ton of stock. This tells me Apple is out of ideas. Tim Cook is robbing this company blind.

They've been spending a fortune in R&amp;D, yet all we have new under Tim Cook is a Watch that collects dust on the nightstand. Sure, they are looking into cars, but....cars???

The Mac line of computers never seem to get updated anymore, yet they'll release 3 iPad size versions and a couple of iPhone versions in a year. I just read a report that Mac sales are on a decline and they've lost what little market share they have, mostly due to the lack of upgrades to the hardware they used to be on the forefront on.

This combined with declining sales of their bread and butter iPhone? Yikes 

Judging by WWDC recently, Apple is truly out of ideas and lost its way. Stickers in the messaging app? Ok. Default apps would go a long way for me but whatever.

Plus, I have to wonder why the stock is so cheap. I've been picking it up all year as I've said, but I think investors realize there's no real future with this company anymore. They've got stagnant. I've owned the stock off and on since 2009 so I've made some gains, but I was hoping this round would be the last who-rah.

This stock has done nothing even in the face of the Brexit rally of the past couple of weeks. Zilch. No where. Sideways. Whatever you want to call it, Apple is lagging behind the market and I'm not just talking about the stock market.

The fundamentals of this company has drastically changed.

Perhaps...PERHAPS, once I see this stock in the low 80's and Apple shows some sign of innovation and a new product or two, that'll be the appropriate time to pick it up again.

But for now. I'm out. Good luck to whoever took my trade at $97.40.",481

16-07-14,4sqzvv,Portfolio returns are 26% lower out-of-sample and 58% lower post-publication.,"I've seen a few comments about academics and predicting the stock market.  I think a topic to actually discuss this issue is important.  

For one, academic publications, especially in statistics, are going to be data analysis of past information.  To claim there is a secret society of academics who can predict the market is quite strange in my opinion.

There have been academic publications in many fields, including finance, where a model can seem to predict data, which in a few years turns out not to be able to predict the future.  One example of this is beta: ""Beta: Black, Jensen, and Scholes (1972), Fama and MacBeth (1973), and others provide evidence that beta is
positively related to expected stock returns, though not as strongly as the CAPM predicts. More recent work
shows that beta has no predictive power after 1960 and no predictive power back to 1926 after controlling for
its correlation with size and B/M (e.g., Fama and French, 1992, 2006b). "" source (the appendix) http://faculty.tuck.dartmouth.edu/images/uploads/faculty/jonathan-lewellen/ExpectedStockReturns.pdf

Another issue is the title of this post.  If there was some magic algorithm that predicting which stocks should be bought, everyone would use it.  If 90% of the market uses this algorithm, it fundamentally changes the factors in which the algorithm was developed, and the algorithm is not accurate anymore. 
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jofi.12365/full

From what I can find, much of the prediction ability of a market is based off of basic criteria such as past performance for the month.  If it has gone up, it is statistically likely to go up within the next month.  

Further, the ability to 'predict the market' is not defined.  The academic work is discussing the statistical relationship between returns of a market wide investment.  In very little cases would this apply to anyone besides large investment firms with significant cash flow, such as the ability to invest it every company in the S&amp;P500.  On that same note, just investing in the S&amp;P500 itself provides a statistically likely return over time.  One basic aspect to this is, companies that fail do not continue to lose money.  Companies can be added to and removed from the exchange. 

Now, maybe everyone talking about academics is already aware of this, but I think there are many people, including myself, who have read 'predicting the market' as if there is a magic box where you ask 'should i buy Ford' and it gives a yes/no, or even a price target and all that.  

tl;dr The words 'predicting the market' can be applied to academics in an academic sense of statistics of past data, refers to large sectors, and is not some magic box making academics millions.

any positive analysis or news will send it soaring.  Tiara run-up will begin later this month

they have been slammed with $70M due to another company (timeline unknown).  they had over $40M in March on hand, with approx $11M paid to legal fees.  that brings them down to the $30M range on hand, and one of their assets are experiencing exponential YoY sales *growth*

worst case scenario, they have to redesign Tiara which is due Aug-Sept iirc

this company is still profitable, but fines and legalities have beaten it down to a discounted pps

analysts have withdrawn ratings because they are *unsure*.  with a current pps under 0.50, I am confident this is a gamble worth playing.  the market has assumed the role of NVCN as being doomed, but if you read analyst articles they just don't know.  they have both bullish and bearish statements

since the market has priced in an 80% drop from previous trading levels, there is not nearly as much downside in this stock as upside

16-07-13,4sp6s6,Student Loans and Stocks?,"Hello everyone,

Over the past couple months I have become more serious/interested about my finances and investing. I am an Aerospace/Mechanical Engineering student with a minor in Computer Science at the University of Florida. I do well in school, and am involved in a few engineering clubs.


My family, however, is by no means rich, and I have accrued a solid chunk of student debt. I am in my third year, and two years out from graduation. After the next two years, my debt will be floating around **$45,000** if I don't pay off anything until then.

Over the past three years, my interest rates have fluctuated between **3.86%** and **4.66%**. Each semester, about 25% of the loan was subsidized, and the rest was unsubsidized.

All that being said, I got a $100 stock gift card, and was thinking of supplementing it with a couple more hundred just to get a stock to play around with and keep track off. (Note: I have had a 20hr part time job for the past year and a half).


One of my friends mentioned he had an educational **Roth IRA**, and suddenly that seemed like a good place to put my money. I thought about it more, and then realized, unless I am getting a guaranteed interest rate over 4.66%, it is best to just start paying off my loans, because I am essentially getting that return immediately. It's not the sexy option, but seems like the smartest.


All that being said, aerospace/mechanical engineering has an average entry level salary anywhere from **$50k - $70k** from what I have seen. So I think I will be able to manage my debt. I definitely plan on diving into stocks when I am financially stable, but since time is so valuable, I figured I would try to start early and set myself up for a financially secure, stress free, late 20s and beyond.


TL;DR - As an engineering student that has decent job prospects, what is the best way to manage my loan money and part time job money early on to set myself up for a thriving 20s and 30s. **Stocks? Roth IRA? SOFI?** Or just straight up paying loans off and spending less than I earn.


Sorry for the super long post!

Regards.

16-07-14,4srger,MSTX Extensive DD,"**Mast Therapeutics (MSTX)** is a San Diego-based biopharmaceutical company with a market cap of approx 95m. They currently have two drugs (Vepoloxamer &amp; AIR001) in clinical trials. This review will focus primarily on

* Vepoloxamer: This is an organic polymer that uses biophysical properties to help remedy damaged phospholipid bilayers. Mast is currently looking to explore its uses in 

* Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) (Phase III) 
* Chronic Heart Failure (Phase II approaching) 
* Ischemic Stroke (Phase II)

**Brief History of Vepoloxamer**
This drug (or its sister analogs) has been investigated for a long time. Burroughs Wellcome conducted many clinical studies on this drug for treatment of acute myocadial infarction. However, renal (kidney) failure was a reoccurring problem due to high absorption in kidney epithelial cells. The candidate was dropped (by Glaxo) and readdressed by CytRx once the source of renal failure was properly addressed (now safe due to purification of P188 by removal of low-molecular weight polymers).

Purification proved to eliminate the kidney problems and a phase II study showed strong results (lower pain in SCD patients). Here’s where things get interesting. There was a phase III study that finished in 2001 that missed its primary endpoint of shorter duration of these vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) (p=0.07 v. a required p&lt;=0.050). This is basically what I would term “trending toward significance” and is a giant pain in the ass for the people who ran this study. Mast thinks that the study design was flawed in a few key aspects and hopes that by increasing sample size they can get that magic p-value. There was a post-hoc analysis (see: sketchy) that states if you eliminate the patients who did not respond to treatment at all, then you get a p-value = 0.02. But then again, it was post-hoc.

So now, to the present, where we have the largest phase III trial in SCD ever so that they can hopefully improve their less-than-desired p-value (as N increases, you get lower variability, but there are diminishing returns) [1] [2]

**How Does Vepoloxamer Work?** (I’m intentionally trying to make this as layman as possible)
Basically, this polymer is structured like a T, where you have two hydrophilic (water soluble) “wings” flanking a hydrophobic (fat soluble) center. As this polymer flows through the circulatory system, it can bind to exposures in the lipid bilayer so that cells become less “sticky.” This is because “like dissolves like” so if you combine shitty red blood cells with arteries filled with VLDLs, you have more a chance of clogging. This limits arterial blood flow, consequentially hindering the ability of the blood cells to distribute oxygen to other parts of your body. If you don’t understand this, Mast has a great video here: http://theepicstudy.com/videos/

**In SCD**
Mast is looking to use MST-188 to improve blood flow during VOCs, which would in turn help distribute oxygen and alleviate pain. It does this by limiting * Adhesion * Hemolysis * Aggregation * and Viscosity[7][Slide 8].
They modified the endpoints for the phase III study. Now the primary endpoint is duration of crisis (from randomization to the cessation of parenteral opioid) and the two secondaries are 1) Rehospitalization for VOCs within 14 days and 2) Acute chest syndrome within 120h of randomization [7][Slide 11]. Mast claims that this will help reduce variability by removing a subjective pain score.
Another interesting thing I am just noticing upon review is the change in demographics. The oldest patient is 46yo, compared to 75 in the previous failed study with a mean of 15yo. This is significant because looking back at [2] you can see from table 5 that this treatment was much more effective in children. As patients age and become more susceptible to atherosclerosis, I would suspect this treatment to become less and less effective.
Vepoloxamer does not have the ability to change the conformation of sickled blood cells [3]. One of the most important aspects of red blood cells is their flexible conformation, which allows for incredible tensile strength. Sickled cells lack this feature, making them very susceptible to bursting and getting stuck.
In short, vepoloxamer looks to solve one aspect of the problem, but there is still much to be desired. That being said, I think they may have adjusted the trial just enough to get that p-value they just missed last time.

**In Heart Failure**
Basically, the heart loses its ability to sufficiently pump, preventing the flow of oxygen to the body’s vital organs [4]. While their phase II study is currently recruiting patients, they have really strong results from their preclinical study in dogs. Cardiac contraction is dependant on Ca2+ influx [5]. In damaged cells, the phospholipid bilayer of the cells may become more permeable calcium, preventing the relaxation necessary for a normal cardiac function.
As discuss previously, MST-188 allows for a “mending” of the damaged phospholipid bilayer, which should in turn lead to a normalized Ca2+ permeability. As you will see from the graphs Mast published, MST-188 allows for an increased left ventricle ejection fraction and a dose-dependant decrease in intracellular calcium concentrations [6]. This is great news and may be an essential supplement to the future treatment of heart failure.

**In Ischemic Stroke**
Stroke occurs when you cut off blood flow to the brain, which results on neuronal death. Depending on the brain area affected, this can cause serious debilitation (notably paralysis and cognitive impairment). Mast has shown that, in combination with tPa, time to reperfusion (restoration of blood flow)[7] [Slide 36], and cognitive performance [8] are enhanced. Additionally, overall survivability was enhanced with sole administration of MST-188 [7] [Slide 37]. This is especially important with an aging global population and seems to be promising, although I think getting a stroke phase II trial will take a significant time so this is hardly a near term catalyst.

**AIR001**
I’m too tired to cover this. Sorry. It won’t move the stock in the near term regardless.

**Financials**
This is basically an all-in on their SCD study. They have enough cash equivalents to stay afloat for ~ 6 mo (starting at march 2016). That means Sept ‘16.

**Summary**
Honestly, I really didn’t like the stock for a while. There were way too many people on WSB just blindly throwing money into because “OMG orphan disease”. I begrudgingly took the responsibility of digesting the facts of this company due to the large amount of votes it received on the Biotech DD thread. There is real boom-or-bust potential in this POS though. After failing for 20 years, I actually think they finally got it right by excluding the geezers from their study. This isn’t a permanent fix to a real genetic problem by any means. It is what I believe to be an effective and well-tolerated band-aid. I am actually much more optimistic on the other applications (heart failure/stroke), but this is worth a shot. Especially with based Shkreli shorting the fuck out of this thing, it will pop real hard if they get approval.

**TLDR:** worth a few OTM calls. Not for the weak of heart. Potential to lose all your investment if primary endpoint not met, but there is serious money to be had and the catalyst should be announced any day now.
Full Disclosure: I am long OTM 2.5 strike 19Aug16 calls on MSTX. What lies in this thread are my interpretations of my secondary research into this company. I welcome all questions and fully encourage readers to check primary sources for themselves, rather than taking my opinions blindly.

I need some help. I don't know much about stocks and all the ways you can lose money and be scammed.

My dad got called by a guy saying that he works for a company that is paid by companies to sell their stocks. He says he tells you what stock to buy and calls you and tells you when to sell.

I said it sounded like a scam but I don't know how they can be making money out of this other than getting a lot of people to do it and then shorting it.

All of these stocks are in the $0.20 to $1.50 range and they are supposed to go up 50 to 200%. 

My dad went ahead and listened to this guy for a stock and ended up making about 1000 dollars. Then the guy called again with another one and he made about 5000 dollars on that one.

Now the guy wants us to subscribe to him to continue to get the tips.

So whats going on? Is this legit? Do people work for companies that are paid to sell companies stock and they know it will go up? I need more information to be able to tell my dad why he should/should not subscribe to them because right now all he sees is 6000 dollars.

Thank you for any help.

I realize they are some semi-obscure stocks. I'm going for value, here, and of the assumption that water is the most valuable of all in the future-VEOEY. I am 18 with a long-term horizon (So I may consider selling NAT soon, as we move away from oil). 

I am also not super confident in U.S. markets in general. I know that it's usually pointed out newbies to investing/younger people generally have this attitude for little reason. This is one you won't convince me out of, whether it be right or wrong. I do still have a little exposure with AAPL.

16-07-14,4suj3u,Want some free easy money over the week-end? Short NFLX!,"[http://i.imgur.com/0Ch6PZy.png](http://i.imgur.com/0Ch6PZy.png)

* **Netflix next's earnings is July 18th** I am betting on a medium-sized crash of the stock price.

* Netflix has plateaued. Look at a 10 year graph: it is the next AAPL. Great company, but the stock has plateaued.

* Unlike AAPL, NFLX trades at a ridiculous P/E and has a fraction of the cash.

* Stock should drop 8-9% following earnings (see: historical data after earnings)

* Buying puts is a low-risk way to benefit from this drop.

* Subcriber count has plateaued, mostly because everyone who wants NFLX has it by now. Really, once everyone in the US is subscribed to US, how can they grow?

* NFLX is a joke internationally. I'm in Canada and I don't know anyone who has it. 

*  Their earnings sucks. They earn something like $0.02 per share (lol). Their revenue's growth will soon flatter, if not stop altogether.

* Like Disney, NFLX will be hit by the ""curse of entertainment,"" meaning it is slower over the beginning of the summer (remember that this quarter's earnings are  april-may-june, where nothing happens.

* NFLX is significantly overvalued.

For this reason, a short on NFLX seems obvious. Buying puts limits your risk and offers great potential returns. Be ready to cover a few days after earnings at most.

16-07-13,4sps2t,Love You Some PokémonGo? You Have Activists To Thank,"If you’re loving running around catching all the damned Pokémons with Pokémon Go you have a Hong Kong-based activist hedge fund, Oasis Management, to thank. Players explore real world locations hunting Pokémon characters. Free to download, it makes its money off in-app purchases that make capturing Pokémon easier. 

The hedge fund is finally making money on their Nintendo position after a near three-year push to get Nintendo to focus more on mobile. The fund has repeatedly called for Nintendo to target the mobile market and has 4% of its fund invested in the name. 

Oasis is one of a handful of activists investors taking on sleepy Japanese companies and looking to overhaul corporate governance there. Note that Dan Loeb’s Third Point has been one of the pioneers of activism in Japan, taking on the parent company of 7-Eleven, Sony, and Suzuki. 

Thanks to Pokémon Go, shares of Nintendo have soared more than 50% in just the last week. If you ask Nintendo, they’ll say the move to mobile was the brainchild of its in-touch C-suite, but it’s hard not see Oasis’ impact. In a 2013 presentation, Oasis had a slide that simply said: We want Nintendo to publish games for iOS and Android.”

They also put out this slide, showing that Nintendo was asleep at the wheel it when it comes to not targeting iOS and Android gaming. 

http://imgur.com/c9Dboj6

When asked about it today, Oasis says that the move into mobile gaming was “so obvious, but nobody was talking about it.”

The problem, Japan operates in a completely different way. It’s very different from the Silicon Valley method of being eccentric, but at the end of the day being rational. Oasis says, “In Japan, analysts are looking at what the companies are doing and not what they could do.”

It took awhile, but Nintendo management appears to have realized that the same people who used to play Donkey Kong and Super Mario are still into gaming, but their engagement is smartphone focused these days. Lest, we forget that the idea of console gaming is quickly declining among millennials. The latest round of XBOX Ones and PS4s could easily be the last iteration of console systems. ",1

16-07-14,4ssbud,"General thoughts on upcoming Q2 Earnings Calls? Brexit fallout, higher wages and negative profits.","Q2 earnings calls are about to start coming out. I'm struggling if they will be a net positive or negative. Can't decide to sell off before the calls to be safe or hold.

From this article: http://www.investing.com/analysis/q2-earnings-grapple-with-brexit-and-wage-growth-200141640

So far, of the 14 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported since the Brexit vote took place, only Carnival (NYSE:CCL) and McCormick (NYSE:MKC) have explicitly mentioned the negative toll it will take on their businesses. All told, around 10% of S&amp;P 500 revenues come from Europe.

Another big trend to watch in 2016 is how higher wages will impact companies’ bottom-lines. Increases come by way of employers that have voluntarily chosen to increase salaries and states that are boosting minimum wages.
This trend started in earnest with Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) in February of 2015 when the world’s largest retailer announced that it was raising entry wages to $9 an hour, and that by February 2016 all employees would earn at least $10/hour. Manager roles were raised to $13, and then to at least $15 an hour earlier this year. While the move was great for the company’s smeared public image, it’s one that will cost $2.7B by the end of the year. In order to compete, other big box retailers felt the pressure to follow suit, including TJX (NYSE:TJX), Target (NYSE:TGT), Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD). This has pressured margins, which have fallen to their lowest levels since 2009. Even the banks are getting involved, with JPMorgan Chase just announcing that it will hike wages for 18,000 low-ranking, hourly employees over the next three years.

While jobs numbers have continually improved since the end of the great recession in 2009, wage growth is one metric that has remained stagnant. The average hourly wage growth figure in the US has not surpassed more than a 0.77% increase on a month-over-month basis in the first half of this year. In June, wages increased 2.6% from the year ago period, a marked improvement from prior months, but still lower than the average of 3% before the recession and no where near the pace it should be at this point in the recovery. But those slight improvements are leading to a situation in which labor costs are now outpacing business output prices, further compressing margins.

Negative Profits Expected to Persist for the 5th Consecutive Quarter
In response to these emerging concerns, estimates for Q2 have continually been ratcheted down for many large multinational corporations. The S&amp;P 500 is currently expected to show a YoY EPS decline of 3% and revenues of -1.1%. This would be the fifth consecutive decline on the bottom-line, marking the first time the index has recorded five consecutive profit declines since during the recession when 9 consecutive quarter were recorded (Q7 2008 - Q3 2009). Revenues are in for their sixth consecutive decline, more than during the recession when 5 consecutive declines were recorded form Q3 2008 - Q3 2009.",2

16-07-14,4ssgel,Have you tried fractional-trading? :),"There are multiple brokers in the US now offering *dollar-based investing* where you can buy $50 of any stock, including high-priced stocks like Amazon who at $700 a share is beyond most first time investors. 

Examples include [DriveWealth](https://drivewealth.com/app/), [Loyal3](https://www.loyal3.com/) and [Stash](https://www.stashinvest.com/). (Any others?)

I think it's a great offering because:

* it's allowing *micro investing* in stocks with high prices like Amazon, Google, PriceLine etc.
* it's intuitive to invest $100 than to buy 1 share @ $XXX
* fees are either low in $ terms or even free

However, I've a few concerns:

* if you own less than 1 share, you've no voting rights
* I'm unsure as to whether you actually own the fractional share, or have an IOU from the broker, i.e. you are taking credit risk
* Are the fees hidden / high. Sure $0.99 sounds low, but if you buy $20 of stock that's still a 5% transaction fee
* some use batch trading (i.e. all trades are aggregated into a mega order at the end of the day)
* market-orders only with no ability to set limits
* There aren't a huge number of stocks that have a $ price over $100. So if you invest $100 at a time, is fractional investing really that innovative?

Love to hear what everyone thinks? Especially if you've tried one of the fractional share apps!

Many thanks.

EDIT:

Two comments below worth highlighting

1. fractional shares don't offer dividend-re-investment-programs
2. they are not tax-efficient accounts

Been pointed out to me that fractional accounts like regular brokerage accounts are SIPC insured too.

16-07-14,4suwta,[Discuss] Diversification in stocks and how much?,"I see a lot of discussion when people link their portfolios as to how many stocks any one individual should hold. I've seen numbers thrown around like 10, 15, 20, 30... and I thought this would be a good discussion to have. 

Here is Warren's Buffet take on it:

**What are your views on diversification?**

&gt;I have 2 views on diversification. If you are a professional and have confidence, then I would advocate lots of concentration. For everyone else, if it’s not your game, participate in total diversification. The economy will do fine over time. Make sure you don’t buy at the wrong price or the wrong time. That’s what most people should do, buy a cheap index fund, and slowly dollar cost average into it. If you try to be just a little bit smart, spending an hour a week investing, you’re liable to be really dumb.

&gt;If it’s your game, diversification doesn’t make sense. It’s crazy to put money into your 20th choice rather than your 1st choice. “Lebron James” analogy. If you have Lebron James on your team, don’t take him out of the game just to make room for someone else. If you have a harem of 40 women, you never really get to know any of them well.


&gt;Charlie and I operated mostly with 5 positions. If I were running 50, 100, 200 million, I would have 80% in 5 positions, with 25% for the largest. In 1964 I found a position I was willing to go heavier into, up to 40%. I told investors they could pull their money out. None did. The position was American Express after the Salad Oil Scandal. In 1951 I put the bulk of my net worth into GEICO. Later in 1998, LTCM was in trouble. With the spread between the on-the-run versus off-the-run 30 year Treasury bonds, I would have been willing to put 75% of my portfolio into it. There were various times I would have gone up to 75%, even in the past few years. If it’s your game and you really know your business, you can load up.


&gt;In stocks, it’s the only place where when things go on sale, people get unhappy. If I like a business, then it makes sense to buy more at 20 than at 30. If McDonalds reduces the price of hamburgers, I think it’s great.


&gt;Source: Emory's Goizueta Business School and McCombs School of Business at UT Austin

&gt;Time: February 2008

He brings up a very basic point that most people here will agree on. You shouldn't expect to win if you don't bring anything to the game. So if you aren't bringing anything into the game (98% of investors) you should invest in index funds and just be happy you're even with how the market is doing. I'm sure the majority of people in this sub have Dunning Kreuger and think they're in the 2% but that's a topic of a another day.

What is interesting is his points on diversifying for those not using index funds. He's said previously that you don't need more than 7... so we'll say 10 ...stocks. If you don't have enough confidence to say your 1st idea is better than your 20th ... did you really do enough homework and should you hold positions in either of these investments? He also implied having too many stocks makes it difficult for you to keep up with any of them and understand any of them well and why stop at 20, why not 30, 40, 50, 100.... might as well do an index fund at that point and you'll get real diversity nevertheless.

So take Amazon, Apple, Google, etc.  Kinda out of my price range to buy too many so I have put more focus on stocks where I can buy a larger stake in.  Then I look at dividiends.  I, like several people, buy stocks for the dividend right?  But are they worth buying if your only going to get .05 cents per share every so many months?  

Here are some perfect examples.  

SWKS - I bought 4 shares because that is all I could buy at the time.

TWLO - said I was going to wait until it went through a market correction of sorts and buy it on the downside.  I coudl have bought it at 25 and now its almost 40.  But even then i would only have been able to buy a certain amount of shares.  Now I dont know if it will drop or how far, but I dont think it will see 25 again and if they do I am not sure its going to be for a good reason.

Just curious about your thoughts on if there is a minimum you should buy or if even 1 share is still a good thing.

The cosy duopoly of NYSE and Nasdaq is long gone. Trading in all assets is now global, but... if you look at their margins, the figures are anything but shabby ;). Certainly the business is doing a lot better than Nasdaq, and the _monopoly_ players internationally.

## Cash / Debt?
Intercontinental Exchange Inc has $6,273M of net debt. That is 2.6x it's latest operating profit. That's higher than I like... but perhaps given the stability of its revenue stream...

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $285.36 for Intercontinental Exchange Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 11% to their target.

# Valuation
The following table shows the key valuation metrics. It's a little surprising that they don't get more love than Nasdaq or BATS. And why are the commodity exchanges so much more valuable?

# Dividends

Intercontinental Exchange Inc is forecast to pay a dividend of $3.40 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $3.10 per share. That is a 10% growth. The forecast dividend of $3.40 compares to a forecast EPS of $13.88, so plenty of cover. Though given the debt levels, we should be happy to see them using earnings to pay down debt.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 11% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -1%. That's against a backdrop on sales up 36%. Net income up 17%. 

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ice/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers. Where they said

&gt; We delivered solid revenue growth, strong operating margin expansion, and once again, double-digit earnings growth. And importantly, we see strong demand from our customers and encouraging trends across the markets we serve.

So perhaps this is still a top line growth, margin expansion, and de-leveraging story? Apart from those, I can't see any other catalysts. You?

16-07-13,4spzt9,Excel Stock Model - Feedback Appreciated!,"Link at bottom!

I’ve seen some people share some cool excel tools over the last couple months so thought I would share this one I was working on a few months ago. I never really had a full plan with the model except to pull in stock data, which eventually led to adding more features. 

To use the model:
The Cover tab just gives some basic info on the stocks you want. 

Pick the 5 tickers that you want to compare and the headers are all dropdowns. Change those before refreshing the data.

Also, refreshing the data takes some time (10-20 seconds), probably because of inefficient VBA and just pulling a lot of info off yahoo.

Prices tab lets you choose a range of dates and you can click on/off which stocks to show.
Past earnings and stock movement are at the bottom.

You can change the # days. (Also, it was a bit tough pulling when the actual earnings reports came out, so those could be off sometimes. It is based on filings in yahoo finance that end with the word “Report”)

The rest of the tabs (Chart Data) are what I really spent most of the time on. I built it to be a research tool, and educational at the same time. I wanted to make all the statements as “Visual” as possible. I apologize that there are some features that I could add, like options to exclude certain line items, but I don’t have too much time to work on the model. 
Also, the chart formats are not all consistent, as I was messing around with what looks best.

Please let me know what you think or if you have any suggestions! 

Also, sorry if you get errors with the macros, I am incredibly novice on VBA and can try fixing issues you might have.

16-07-14,4sso3m,"Why are both ""everything is awesome"" and ""panic"" (stock) signals soaring ?","What I would consider ""panic"" (very defensive) bonds, funds, ETFs, ... ie. bets on the economy deteriorating rapidly

TLT
GLD/IAU/...
GDX
...

And ""aggressive"" stocks/funds/ETFs (the bets on the economy improving rapidly)

SPY/DIA/VTI (and the many other SPX500 mirror ETFs)
LQD/BND
HYG and family (HYG is the odd one out here, as the graph does look like investors are much less convinced)

These represent diametrically opposite investment theses, so why are they both going up ? Also if this keeps going, how can this end ? It seems to me that given a clash between these 2 viewpoints, any downward move could quickly accelerate and would take much less selling to create a fullblown panic situation, so isn't the panic side pretty much guaranteed to win ?

""Non-financial"" Numbers seem to favor the panic thesis:

Earnings expectations are negative, and dropping (e.g. http://www.investing.com/analysis/sp-500-weekly-earnings-update:-can-the-sp-500-make-an-all-time-high-off-200140886, SP500 average -4.8 earnings growth, -1% expected revenue growth, and those are non-GAAP measures. On a GAAP basis we're easily in the 2 digit negative range)
The currency wars are restarting ( https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=USDJPY , and it's not just Japan, but most recently China, Euroland, Britain (not entirely voluntarily on the BoE's part I guess, but still) and Malaysia). Given the current Fed path, the dollar should soar in the medium term, putting further pressure on SPX500 earnings.
Energy is not recovering, nor are goods transport indices. Put otherwise: global trade is down sharply YoY, and while it has recovered a bit ... Recently, oil has restarted it's slide and it appears to be going down consistently

Financial numbers seem to favor the ""economy is great !"" thesis:

SPY stock prices up a lot
Large cap bonds up a lot

So my question really is simple : WTF is going on ? The only thing that makes some sense in my mind is that there has been a huge jump in inflation and the world is at the very beginning stages of pricing this in. But given the price changes already happened it's going to be huge inflation for quite a while. Would you agree ? Why/why not ?",29

16-07-13,4sq260,"Is the S&amp;P in a short squeeze?","TL;DR If you are shorting you better pray to god you don't get margin called.  

The S&amp;P is just knocking out new ATH's left and right.  It just doesn't make sense.  How can the S&amp;P be shooting up to ATH's with Brexit, uncertainty with the European Union sticking together, falling oil and a market that's been stagnate for over a year after a huge bull run.  After the S&amp;P hit all time highs I started looking for bearish charts or patterns that could allow for new ATH's while still being bearish.  I came up with this chart I posted yesterday http://imgur.com/bE2Xlqk.  After seeing a pattern that may occur I also like to ask the ""why would this happen?"" question.  Why would the S&amp;P go to 2210 with all the bad news and everybody feeling that we are overvalued?
  
I then thought about /u/fscomeau.  /u/fscomeau through out the past couple months he has been the epitome of the emotions of the market.  On the uptrend he's screaming for ATH's and we will never see sub 2100 S&amp;P ever again.  A few weeks later Brexit happen and its ""we will never see over 2000 again"".  Why is this important?  I think it shows how bull sentiment changed with Brexit.  During Brexit so many bulls jumped ship onto the bear train that it overloaded it.  It seemed like a such a sure thing at the time.  There was no way with the EU in turmoil we would go to ATH's.  We have no reason to be at ATH's.  But here we are on a rocket shooting through ATH's with little resistance. Why would anyone be putting money in the market right now?  Even the knee jerk trend reactionary /u/fscomeau can't believe we keep going up. The S&amp;P just plowed right through 2135.  It didn't try to test it.  None of it makes any sense...  Unless... Unless there's a short squeeze underway.  Think about all the /u/fscomeau's out there who went from bull to bear on top of everyone else who was already feeling bearish.  Thinking "" this is our time to shine!"" and licking their greedy lips to short the market down to 1800.  But there was a dead cat bounce and I think too many bears tried to cover too quickly pushing the market back up and up.  And now its just a viscous cycle of covering.
  
I spent today loading up on 219 SPY calls.  I think the S&amp;P is going to 2210 as the new ATH.  Not only I do I think its going to 2210 but I think it will be there by next Monday or Tuesday.   I can't believe I'm buying call options 60 points above ATH's after an 8 year bull run and stagnate year after it and on the brink of a crash...  But when /u/fscomeau can't believe it should go up any more and should crash any second... you gotta inverse...  Wish me luck and GFY

16-07-14,4svciu,Looking to invest through fidelity or vanguard. Advice?,"After starting a new job and receiving a decent salary I've thought its in my best interest to start investing money into the stock market. I am interested in doing a dollar cost average totaling $2,400 for 12 months so I wouldn't have to purchase stocks at the price they are today. 

A past professor I had recommended I invest in a large index ETF fund that mirrors the Dow jones or the s&amp;p 500. He believes this would give me the largest diversification. 

Being a college student and still being new to investing I am looking for all the advice I can get. I am interested in starting a brokerage account as I am young and believe I will one day want to take money out of the account (as compared to an IRA.) I think for my current situation a brokerage account would be a better option than an IRA for various reasons. 

Now for my next question is with who do I open an account? My professor says he uses fidelity but through some research I believe vanguard may be the better option. I specifically like how with vanguard you are part company holder therefore if they make money you make money. But it seems fidelity is the more popular option on the market. I am sure either option is a good choice but for a student who most likely won't be making a ton of trades, or who expects to only invest $2-$3k a year (for now at least, only 20) what's the better choice for me? Any advice is greatly appreciated! ",2

I am wondering if anyone has experience with these sites and can give feedback?

16-07-14,4svym9,input on my strategy of custom index funds,"Warning, long post. Tl;dr at the end. 

I wanted to invest for a 10-30 year time frame and liked the passive approach but didn't want to just dump my money in a few index funds and leave. I definitely wanted specific exposure to virtual reality, robotics and automation, drones, electric and autonomous vehicles, elderly care, micro caps, ciber security, organic and natural food and products, and alternative energy. I also had a few companies I specifically liked.. dis, ge, IBM, and many others.

I decided to make my own blend of index investing and specific researched picks. I looked at index funds, etfs, and mutual funds in a specific category,  then personally looked into the top 25 ish holdings, then did more research on the ones I liked the most, and kept track of these picks. I would generally end up with 10 or so companies after reviewing 3 or 4 funds and also would research each category myself
Independently of this and would generate another 5-10 companies. In the end, I would have 10-20 companies that I personally felt were good long term holds and all in the industry I was seeking to cover. This provided a smaller, riskier group of stocks in a sector but a group I felt better about, had more potential for gains, and still would track the sector in general.

I did similar research into small caps, mid caps, and large caps in general as well as major sectors.. industrials, tech, healthcare, energy, etc. I made sure I had covered every major sector reasonably evenly with a slant towards my personal selections.

Each purchase was completed with the commission fee equaling to no more than 1% of the purchase amount, usually .5%. This way, it may be a slight hit total but not much more than the expenses from index funds, mutual funds, etc, and I only had to pay it once. 

I spent a year purchasing the stocks fit the portfolio, and many were purchased after the big hits we had last August, in Jan, and on brexit which was nice. I plan on balancing the portfolio each quarter by selling off gains for companies that are way up and purchasing more when a company takes a hit.

If anyone actually read all this, please give feedback or additional advice.

Tl;dr.... for long term investing: pick sectors you like for long term gain, select 10-20 companies you like the most in said sector after much research to create a custom index fund fit that sector, fill in missing major sectors similarly. Make sure each transaction costs less than 1% in fees. Rebalance and adjust periodically.

My choices: 10% robotics and automation, 10% alt energy, 10% electric and autonomous vehicles, 10% REITs, 10% international index funds, 5% organic products, 5% ciber security, 5% healthcare, 5% drones, 5% virtual reality, 5% microcaps, 5% favorite large caps, 10% others to fill in holes, and 5% cash

16-07-14,4sw3xx,"Mod request: help us improve the sidebar resources including FAQ, recommended reading, online coursework, and wiki","Alright kids, we're growing, a lot.  Reddit is now a mecca of online media and what was once our humble little sub is now 200k subscribers strong.  We've been mentioned in major financial publications more than once and that trend isn't likely to slow.

In response to the expected influx of novice investors I'm looking to improve our sidebar resources over the next few weeks(perhaps months).  This effort should have the twofold effect of providing more education to novices and cutting down on repeat advice/frequent flyer questions.  

That's where you our wonderful subscriber comes in:  Please comment below with information that you'd like to see added as a resource.  Here are a few key areas:

1) FAQ.  We've got one right now but it's a bit out of date.  Go ahead and post up all of those repetitive questions that make you want to throw your[electronic device of choice] through the wall.  I'm talking about the ""which broker is best for me"" and ""how do I buy stocks"" posts.  If you've seen it posted more than once a month it's safe to say it belongs in the FAQ.  If you're feeling spicy maybe even provide a nice detailed answer to said frequent question for us to use.

2) Recommended reading: I'm looking to expand this area quite a bit and also rank recommendations by beginner/intermediate/expert so we don't have high schoolers grabbing a copy of *Security Analysis* and asking why they can't find any railroad bonds on yahoo finance.

2(b) Recommended coursework/white papers: There are a ton of free classes/coursework material by prominent financial minds.  Post links to your favorites with a quick description.  Also what are some of your favorite white papers?  We'll assimilate links to those based on level of acumen and add that to the reading library for those looking to research specific topics.

3) wiki contributions.  If you've got any favorite posts/write ups of something you think should be in the wiki please post it up.  This can be as simple as explaining the difference between a mutual fund and an etf to an explanation of quantitative easing.

4) Macroeconomic resources.  It's been said before that investing is just applied economics.  Post up some favorite economic articles/resources.  For example I like [this](http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/ben-bernanke/posts/2015/03/30-why-interest-rates-so-low) piece by ol Helicopter Ben about why rates are the way they are.  Have another favorite?  post it up.

5) specific subtopics of investing for example:  

* Fundamentals investing (value, spec sit, event driven, etc would all go here)

* Quantitative investing

* Algorithmic investing

* Technical trading
* Behavioral / momentum / sentiment
* Macro

Have an excellent resource on one of the above?  Want to do a write up on one of those topics?  Think I missed something?  Go ahead and post it below.  The more the better.

I'll leave this post stickied for a while for exposure and to give y'all some time to post stuff up. 

Thanks in advance!

# Description
The Coca-Cola Company is a beverage company. The Company owns or licenses and markets over 500 nonalcoholic beverage brands, primarily sparkling beverages but also a range of still beverages, such as waters, enhanced waters, juices and juice drinks, ready-to-drink teas and coffees, and energy and sports drinks. It markets, manufactures and sells beverage concentrates, which are referred to as beverage bases, and syrups, including fountain syrups (concentrate business or concentrate operations), and finished sparkling and still beverages (finished product business or finished product operations).

What we often miss as investors is that $KO is a concentrates business. It has affiliates that do the actual, mixing, bottling and distribution of Coke.

## Recent financials 

2015 didn't look too good. Though a look though their 10-K reveals that the 4% decline in sales was driven by a 7% move in the $. That hurts and hopefully 2016 isn't going to experience the same pain.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $44.3bn | $46.0bn | $46.9bn | $48.0bn | $46.5bn|
|EPS | $1.67 | $1.60 | $1.90 | $1.97 | $1.85|

## Competition
Here's how they see the competition:

&gt; The nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry is highly competitive, consisting of numerous companies ranging from small or emerging to very large and well established. In many of the countries in which we do business, including the United States, PepsiCo, Inc. (""PepsiCo""), is one of our primary competitors. Other significant competitors include, but are not limited to, Nestlé, DPSG, Groupe Danone, Mondelēz International, Inc. (""Mondelēz""), Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (""Kraft""), Suntory Beverage &amp; Food Limited (""Suntory"") and Unilever. 

Looking at the stats, Pepsi's bigger but perhaps that's cos it owns its bottlers / distributors.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
The Coca-Cola Co | $43,865M | 27% | 27%
Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. | $6,318M | 25% | 37%
PepsiCo, Inc. | $62,173M | 20% | 36%

In fact, there are lots of Coca-Cola bottlers and many are listed. They own over $15bn of stock in these affiliates. Margins and returns vary wildly. Though in total they have more sales combined than KO itself.

|Bottling Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated | $2,479M | 8% | 22%
Coca-Cola European Partners PLC | $6,897M | 17% | 58%
Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. (ADR) | $8,444M | 20% | 11%
Embotelladora Andina SA (ADR) | $2,797M | 16% | 10%
Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB (ADR) | $18,089M | 14% | 9%
Monster Beverage Corp | $2,776M | 37% | 22%

## Cash / Debt?
The Coca-Cola Co has $24,623M of net debt. That is 2.1x it's latest operating profit. 

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $48.35 for The Coca-Cola Co and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 6% to their target. Which is far from exciting.

# Valuation

The following table shows the key valuation metrics. But it's hardly surprising that their forecast upside isn't large, give a PE ratio in the 20s and a low single digit forecast long term growth. Though at 8% the FCF yield is pretty respectable.

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/ko/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
KO | $197,880M | 24x | 5% | 3% | 8%
DPS | $18,063M | 22x | 9% | 2% | 8%
PEP | $158,178M | 23x | 7% | 3% | 7%

I am a little surprised that some of the bottlers have higher PEs. Can they really grow significantly faster than KO or generate greater cashflow?

Bottling Companies|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
COKE.O | $1,368M | 22x | N/A | 1% | 9%
CCE | $17,368M | 16x | 10% | 2% | 13%
KOF | $5,432M | 25x | 8% | 3% | 8%
AKOB | $3,385M | 26x | -5% | 2% | 8%
FMX | $30,981M | 27x | N/A | 2% | 9%
MNST.O | $32,848M | 41x | 21% | 0% | 2%

# Dividends

The Coca-Cola Co is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.38 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $1.34 per share. That is a 3% growth. The forecast dividend of $1.38 compares to a forecast EPS of $1.94. So it's fair to say, they aren't hoarding the cashflow. 

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price hasn't moved, that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of zero. That's against a backdrop of sales down 4% in 3 months. 

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ko/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers. On it they said:

&gt; We expect organic revenue growth of 4% to 5% and comparable currency neutral EPS growth of 4% to 6%, inclusive of a three to four point structural headwind to income before tax.

So low single digit growth, before accounting for moves in the %. 

I can't help but feeling that Coca-Cola has made to everywhere on the planet. That they are an economic bellwether. They've seen issues in key markets like Brazil &amp; China recently, but that's been offset by the US, Japan and India. So no surprises there, economically. 

And if the global economy is the only real catalyst, then isn't that a tad boring? Or maybe even scary if you are paying 24x forecast earnings?

**Executive Summary**

Apple Inc. was founded more than 40 years ago and has experienced tremendous growth. They began by developing and manufacturing personal computers and have grown into one of the most valuable tech companies in the world. With great success comes great expectations, and investors have a tendency to punish Apple (AAPL) if they don’t significantly beat expectations. They are currently trading 28% below its 52 week high.

This paper will discuss their 2016 Q2 results, interpret their financials, explain their different revenue streams, discuss their future direction, and will recommend a buy, sell, or hold recommendation. There are many people that will tell you that Apple is a one-trick-pony, that if their iPhone sales slowdown, they will fall just like tech companies of the past have. The bears like to compare Apple to other historical models like Blackberry, IBM, or Microsoft. These historical models suggest that Apple cannot retain their large growth forever and will eventually slow as their innovation and sales stagnate. 

Earlier this week, on April 16, 2016, Apple posted its first quarterly loss in more than 13 years. This can be attributed to economic factors in China, slowing iPhone sales, and a slightly weaker gross profit margin. The strong dollar is a major reason why Apple didn’t meet revenue expectations, as the majority of their weakness is in Hong Kong. iPhone sales were also down from a year ago in Q2 2015. While many analysts think Apple is a cyclical company that relies solely on their iPhone sales, I will explain throughout this paper why Apple is much more than simply the iPhone. With $50.6B in revenues, an EPS of $1.90, and a P/E of 10.08, Apple is a strong buy at $94.83 a share.      

**Article Summary**

In an article published on April 26, 2016, the New York Times reports Apple’s Q2 results and suggests reasons why Apple missed earnings expectations for the first time in over a decade. “The technology company’s dazzling 13-year run of quarterly revenue growth ended on Tuesday 
— a casualty of Apple’s already immense size, weakness in key global markets like China and 
the lack of another hot product to pry open the wallets of customers” (Goel, 2016). While the 
article provides the raw data from the earnings results, the author also projects a bearish sentiment to it. “Nearly half of the smartphones sold in the United States are iPhones, and Apple may be reaching the saturation point among potential customers in other developed countries” (Goel, 2016). It should be noted that this is mere speculation. Although Apple owns over half of the smartphone market here in the US, Apple is still expanding into emerging markets. Apples dominance will continue to chip away at the Android market and bring new customers into their ecosystem. The article points out Apple’s revenue decline from one year ago, “declined 13 percent to $50.6 billion as sales of its flagship product, the iPhone, fell, with little else to take its place” (Goel, 2016). The article reports that Apple sold 16% less iPhones than the same quarter last year. The higher revenues a year ago can be easily explained if you consider the iPhone upgrade cycles. Every two years a new iPhone is launched, and the years between Apple releases small upgraded features to the same model. In September of 2014 they released the iPhone 6, their first device with a larger screen. “The company has just announced that it set a ""new record"" after selling 10 million units of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 units combined during their three-day launch weekend beginning Sept. 19” (Arce, 2016). It would make sense why iPhone 6 sales are spilling over into 2015 Q2 numbers. The 2016 Q2 period is coming off of the iPhone 6S upgrade cycle, where less customers are upgrading their phones compared to 2015 Q2. In September of 2016 Apple will release their newest iPhone, the iPhone 7. 

The article also uses another negative opinion from an outside analyst, “There’s no question that Apple’s best days are behind it,” said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at the Bernstein brokerage firm. “The company grew at astronomical rates, and it’s now so big that its ability to grow at those rates doesn’t exist anymore.” (Goel, 2016). The analyst holds a popular industry-wide opinion: Apple cannot maintain its current growth. Despite the fact that Apple is being beaten down by Wall Street and suffering from global economic concerns, I will clearly explain why Apple is a clear and strong buy. 

**Interpreting the Financials**

The second quarter results were not in line with analyst expectations. “The Company posted quarterly revenue of $50.6 billion and quarterly net income of $10.5 billion, or $1.90 per diluted share. These results compare to revenue of $58 billion and net income of $13.6 billion, or $2.33 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was 39.4 percent compared to 40.8 percent in the year-ago quarter” (Hoover, 2016). That’s a Q2 drop 12.79% from the same quarter one year ago. But a 10.96% increase from the same quarter two years ago. Their EPS is down 
18.45% from a year ago, but up 14.45% from the same quarter two years ago. Despite this Q2 miss, Apple’s gross profit margin decreased by 3.43%, but over the past year they have increased their NPM by 5.73%. During the earnings call, CEO Tim Cook announced more money being brought back to the shareholders. They announced an additional $50 billion to their program to return capital back to shareholders; they authorized $40 billion towards share buy backs, and a 10% increase in their quarterly dividend. Apple likes returning money to its shareholders, which can be seen with their high ROE ratio. ROE is up 49.76 from 2013, and 26.31% from 2014. 

During the conference all Apple’s CEO said, “Our team executed extremely well in the face of strong macroeconomic headwinds” (Hoover, 2016). It was reported that international sales accounted for 67% of the quarter’s revenue, which could explain the missed revenue growth for the past few quarters. If more than half the revenues are hurt by the strong dollar, Apple looks rather strong considering they still pulled in $50 in revenue. 

Their $230 billion in cash is located overseas and would have to pay the full 35% corporate tax to bring it back to the US. This cash isn’t just sitting there; it’s placed into long-term marketable securities earning interest. To avoid paying all the taxes to bring the money back to the US, Apple announced in February of 2016 that they would issue $10-12 billion of bonds to finance share buybacks and dividends. “Apple said that the proceeds from the deal would be used for “general corporate purposes” including “repurchases of our common stock and payment of dividends under our program to return capital to shareholders” (Jackson, 2016). It’s cheaper for them to issue debt than to use their own cash, plus they get a tax write off for the interest expense. 
To show how strong Apple’s financials are, I will be comparing them with two of their largest competitors: Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MFST). Although Apple has many competitors, I believe these two companies are the only ones that have a real shot at taking market share from them. Microsoft has been very successful with software and licensing, and has recently released their new Surface device. The Surface has been very popular and has given Microsoft some hope in competing with Apple’s iMacs. Their Windows phones however don’t pose any serious threat to the iPhone, and will most likely never catch on. I believe Alphabet is Apple’s #1 competitor. They’re both valued at around $500 billion and focus heavily on research and developing grandiose innovations. “Even though they compete across a huge range of subindustries, such as computing software, hardware, operating systems, mobile devices, advertising, applications and Web browsing, each firm takes a different approach from an organizational and philosophical perspective” (Ross, 2015). You can see that all three companies have high gross profit margins, but Apple achieves a slightly high net profit margin. 
Apple has always had incredibly high gross profit margins and maintained high net profit margins throughout the years. Their 2016 Q2 reported NPM of 22.87%.  What’s more impressive, is their ability to maintain high net profit margins year after year. In the past 12 quarters Apple has seen steady improvements in their NPM. These steady margins are attributed to their excellent management. You can see how well Apple has been managing their assets and improving their net profit margins. Compared to their competitors, their ratios are significantly better. These ratios show how effective Apple’s management is with supply chain management and asset turnover. These high gross profits and stand-out ratios are reasons why Apple has looked so attractive to investors. Their ROA increased from 17.04% in 2014 to 18.38% in 2015, an increase of 7.86%. They charge higher prices compared to their competition, and they maintain high gross margins, year after year. 

As mentioned before, investors hold Apple to a much higher standard than other companies. Apple has to not only beat earnings expectations, but they have to beat them by a 
significant margin or else the market will punish the stock price.  Benjamin Graham said, “In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.” This is a 
company that isn’t meant to be traded; it should be a long term investment. The peaks and troughs should be ignored and in the long run, Apple’s true valuation will be priced in. Their second quarter numbers weren’t in line with expectations, but I strongly believe their stock has seen an irrational and unjustified sell off in the past year. On February 23, 2015 Apple shares hit its all-time high of $133/share, which gave them a market cap of $736 billion. They were expected to be the first trillion dollar company. Quarter after quarter they met all expectations, yet the stock continued to fall to where it is today. As of April 28, 2016, Apple is trading at $94.83/share, roughly down 28% February 2015.  The price to earnings ratio is a way of valuing a company based off its share price divided by its earnings per share. If a company has very little earnings compared to its share price, the ratio can be extremely high. Netflix and Amazon for example have both high P/E ratios because they have very little earnings. Investors who buy these high P/E stocks are paying very high multiples. They’re valuing the companies as if they actually made money. Apple on the other hand, is trading at very low multiple and the market has already priced them in for lower future sales. Their current P/E ratio is 10.88, meaning you’re only paying 10 times earnings. You can see from the attached chart that it’s quite cheap compared to its competitors. Alphabet is trading 30.39 times earnings, and Microsoft is trading for 38.82 times earnings. You can say that you’re paying 179% more for Alphabet, and 256% more for Microsoft.

**Revenue Streams**

The main article discussed in this paper suggests that Apple’s innovation and high growth has peaked. Like tech companies of the past have proved, a company can’t stay hot forever. Investors believe that when iPhone sales start slowing, Apple’s valuation will collapse. I will breakdown Apple’s revenue streams and explain why they are more than just a smartphone company. In their second quarter earnings report they showed high revenue growth in their services sector accompanied by their highly valuable ecosystem.

While Apple is known as a hardware company, they are making huge revenues through their services and expanding ecosystem. “Investors may have been focused on the decline in iPhone shipments when Apple reported its latest quarterly results on Tuesday, but there was one bright spot which could be a key driver of growth for the U.S. technology giant: Services” (Kharpal, 2016). Their services include products like iTunes, their App Store, Apple Pay, and Apple Music. On the Q2 earnings call, Tim Cook said, “We are very happy with the continued strong growth in revenue from Services, thanks to the incredible strength of the Apple ecosystem and our growing base of over one billion active devices” (Hoover, 2016). Apple’s ecosystem makes all these services much more accessible, which leads to much higher revenues. “Revenue from services came in at $5.99 billion in the fiscal second quarter - a 20 percent rise from the same period last year, highlighting the focus Apple has been putting on the segment” (Kharpal, 2016). While Apple sees higher revenues during iPhone upgrade cycles, their Services give them recurring and growing revenues. There’s a lot of room to grow in some of their newer services, “The current 13 million subscriber number for Apple Music, which chief executive Tim Cook announced yesterday, was small in comparison to the over 1 billion install base of Apple devices” (Kharpal, 2016). 

Apple’s ecosystem is an integral part of the whole user experience when using Apple products.  It’s also a big reason why Apple users would never considering switching to Google’s Android devices. “As the years have rolled on however, it’s clear that Apple’s competitive advantage isn’t built on its hardware or its software. Apple’s greatest competitive advantage is its ecosystem” (Jackson, 2016). Apples ecosystem includes the following: iMac, iPad, iPod, iPhone, iTunes, iCloud, Apple TV, App Store, Apple Watch, Apple Pay, Car Play, and the Health Kit. All of these devices are continuously synced together. As an example, you can start an email on your iPad, and finish it on your iPhone. You can download music through iTunes and it will simultaneously be available to listen to across all your devices, including your CarPlay located in your automobile. When someone buys an iPhone, they will most likely purchase more Apple devices inside the ecosystem instead of buying an nonintegrated PC from Microsoft or device from Google. “Apple today trumpeted that gross revenue from its iOS App Store -- which now also includes software for the Apple Watch and Apple TV -- exceeded $20 billion for 2015, implying that sales were up between 40% and 47% year-over-year” (Keizer, 2016). It’s easy to see how valuable Apple’s ecosystem is for both the consumers and their total revenues. 

**Apple’s Next Big Move**

Apple is often criticized for having so much cash, but never making any big acquisitions. I’m bullish on Apple because I like cash rich companies that are patient and extremely careful with their capital budgeting and acquisitions. They have some of the smartest minds in the industry and I suspect they are working on several large projects.  Reports show that Apple has been hiring experts from the automotive industry to begin developing a car. “Apple has several hundred employees working secretly toward creating an Apple-branded electric vehicle, according to people familiar with the matter. They said the project, code-named “Titan,” has an initial design of a vehicle that resembles a minivan, one of these people said” (Ramsey, 2015). Why should they make their own car when they could just buy Tesla? Apple might be able to do it cheaper, have full autonomy, and build something that blows Tesla away. Just to put things into perspective, Apple has so much cash they could buy Tesla, Netflix, and Starbucks, all at a 20% premium. Yet, Apple hasn’t been making any big acquisitions. They have made one small acquisition in the past year: a virtual reality startup. “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,” an Apple spokesperson wrote in an email to VentureBeat” (Novet, 2016). Facebook on the other hand, has been snatching up numerous companies. In 2014 alone, they acquired 56 companies, one of which cost them $19 billion. Apple on the other hand has not announced any big plans, besides the car, and we must assume they are planning something big. It’s possible that Apple knows they don’t need to acquire anything; they have the most valuable company in the world and boast a 40% profit margin. 

I think within the next five years Apple’s market share will dominate all world economies at a far greater scale. I believe they will consume the entire smartphone market share, and their ecosystem will aid in higher revenues and increased customer retention. I think their valuation will shoot well past one trillion dollars after they make one of the largest acquisitions in world history. I can speculate, and see Apple buying a company like Visa, one of the world’s largest multination financial services company. 

Apple has grown from a hardware and software company into a luxury brand with the highest of customer loyalty. They are cash rich, well disciplined, provide a high ROE, and are currently trading 28% below its 52 week highs. As Benjamin Graham said, “In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.” Apple has been beaten up in the past year due to macroeconomic factors, but has proven they can still churn out 200B in annual revenue in a bad year. Apple is only trading at 10x earnings, they are months away from the iPhone 7 upgrade cycle, and I rate Apple (AAPL) as a strong buy.

16-07-14,4str5o,All good things must come to an end,"Some light Thursday morning inspiration for you…In this case, we’re talking about the stimulus of the ECB’s Corporate Sector Purchase Program (CSPP) on EUR IG non-bank bonds, driving a vivid  outperformance of CSPP-eligible vs. non-eligible bonds. But when using past ECB programs as a guide, we expect that by year-end the pace of purchases will necessarily slow and the impact on the eligible universe will fade. 

1 month into the program and €8.5 billion of EUR bond purchases later, [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] assess the robust (yet potentially ephemeral) impact of the CSPP. Some Q&amp;A: 

1.	How has the CSPP impacted the EUR IG bond market?
Within the universe of EUR non-bank bonds, the CSPP's announcement on March 10 had roughly the same positive impact on eligible and non-eligible bonds—with both universes tightening by 27bp in the four weeks since the announcement—as the criterion for eligibility were initially unclear. But since the purchases began on June 8, the impact has been visible. CSPP-eligible bonds have outperformed their non-eligible counterparts in the first month of the program, with the former tightening by 8bp while ineligible bonds tightened by only 1bp. 

2.	But could the outperformance of CSPP-eligible bonds just reflect compositional differences? 
To rule out this possibility, we constructed two otherwise identical portfolios of CSPP-eligible and ineligible bonds, controlling for sector, ratings, maturity, and parent companies’ countries of risk. And we found that the outperformance of CSPP-eligible bonds since Jun 8 is still significant even when accounting for compositional differences with the non-eligible cohort. 

3.	How long will the CSPP effect last? 
If the ECB is able to maintain its current pace of purchases of non-bank corporate bonds, it would own more than 15% of the eligible market in one year’s time. As the flow of purchases becomes predictable and the supply scarcity begins to set in, the impact of the CSPP will likely begin to wear off. Using the third covered bond purchase program (CBPP3) as a guide (the CBPP3 was announced in September 2014), we estimate that by the end of the year the pace of purchases will slow and the outperformance of the eligible universe will stabilize.

16-07-15,4swzvm,Netflix calls are the way to go (DD),"Netflix gave guidance to expect 2 cents of earnings per share. I really doubt we're going to see worse than 2 cents per share. It would be dropping the ball big time if the CFO of Netflix allowed spending to happen which would place the books at less than guidance.

If you take it as a given that earnings will be at guidance or better, then I think it's a clear that being bullish on netflix is the way to go (i.e. market does not expect that much better than guidance). 

Next, I think we can safely say that the risk of netflix users churning is low since netflix has been making great choices for its originals. There are a lot of articles raving about netflix emmys right now. There are 56 emmy nominations associated with netflix originals.

Last quarter they came in with low expectations for user acquisition. From last quarters letter:
""In the US, we added 2.23 million members in Q1, against 2.28 million a year ago, and 2.25 two years
ago. Our forecast for the quarter was low (at 1.75 million) because we underestimated the positive
acquisition impact of our major original content debuts."" 
Well, their originals are doing even better now than they were before.

Last quarter they also gave guidance on # of new users for Q2. They estimate 0.5 million. They also state that this includes a modest impact from 'un-grandfathering', i.e. people whose bills go from $8 to $10. I wouldn't be surprised if this is way too conservative and we will probably see acquisitions beat guidance like in Q1.

I think Netflix is low-balling us with the guidance.

16-07-15,4sz7if,Opinions and questions on selling covered calls,"When I submitted my application for options trading I was only approved for level 1, I think, because I'm only allowed to sell covered calls. For this I am thinking there are two main strategies.

1.) Pick a stock that has crazy votility with a relatively low price that I can put a high strike price that would fetch a nice premium. The only thing is I have to find the stock that people are willing to pay that, that isn't already over populated with options; unless I undercut other sellers. 

2.) The second is the more typical solution which is to pick a stable company, like GE, that I feel good about long term with a strike price close to the current price. This is the one that I usually see referenced in the ""How to sell covered calls"" topics.

Does anyone have experience selling covered calls? If so what strategies worked for you? How do my strateies sound, screwed up, room for improvment, suggestions? Also, will this experience eventually allow me to start buying calls and puts? I have a lot more learning to do before I execute my first call writing, but I figured I would start with the sub that would give me an honest opinion.",3

CAR-T has seen some fantastic results in trials (at least blood cancers) and looks to be the next evolution of cancer treatment as long as issues with manufacturing, delivery and pricing can be worked out.

**Cellectis plus points:**

1. Working on producing allogeneic cells which would allow for ""off-the-shelf"" cancer treatments as opposed to the current most advanced CAR-T candidates which have to extract T-cells from patients and genetically modify them before reintroduction.

2. Their tech seems to work, cured leukemia in two babies so far - the latest in [May this year](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-celltherapy-idUSKCN0XX1F7)

3. They have a licensing deal with Pfizer who owns about 10% of the company. Pfizer have expressed interest in [acquiring Cellectis in the past](http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/pfizer_bids_1.5bn_for_car-t_specialist_cellectis_745990) and now that the Allergan deal has collapsed Pfizer has a lot of free cash for acquisitions. They already [bought Anacor](http://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer_to_acquire_anacor) in May but that was peanuts compared to the $160 billion Allergan deal.

If you are slightly familiar with HLF and how a pyramid scheme works, you know that those demands will hit the core of the company a.k.a. lies and money flow that keep them afloat.

There are only two options here: Either Herbalife complies with the demands and sink slowly into bankrupcy as the recruitment of ""partners"" dies down month after month or they simply ignore those demands and end up being sued again/shut down. Of course, there is always the possibility of FTC inertia/incompetence, but given the headline and the number of people ""unhappy"", this could be considered somewhat unlikely.

(Un)fortunately, there are a TON of books when it comes to the field of investing. As a noob, I find it hard to separate the gold from the pyrite. The only book I know that has been recommended time and time again and received good reviews overall is The Intelligent Investor by Graham.

So, I have a bunch of other books on my list. A think it wouldn't be too unfair to say that MOST of these are POP-investing books. I.e. they seem to have taken the fundamentals of investing that might take a bit more intellectual energy and simplified them for the general public. And then there are those that want to sell me the ""secret method.""

I am aware that that there is a difference between signal and noise. But, I don't know what that difference is when it comes to investing since I have basically JUST gotten started (I have only read a few chapters of The Intelligent Investor so far).

So:

1) How do I go about vetting which books are worth purchasing and reading. I don't think Amazon reviews are a good measure.

2) If you had to recommend 2-3 books for someone that you feel would cover a VERY LARGE base of investing knowledge and foundations, what would they be?

-First and foremost: Kevin MOTHAFUCKIN' Plank. This dude is a genius, a graduate of UMD ( a school specializes in supply chain management not that any of that fuckin matters), he is a straight up leader. I've met him personally and his employees would be licking his boots if they didn't have work to do. This guy rules with respect and a forward thinking mindset that you want in a successful company. 

-second and sensual: Their signings. It is undeniable that these guys are on a hotstreak with with signings. Steph Curry, Cam Newton, recently Ingram, Tom Brady, and then some big names from that gay ass sport where you smack balls with a stick and run around in circles like an autist (I refuse to look up their names). But the point is they are earning the respect of big name athletes and Nike is losing it.

-Thrid and blurred: Just a few random notes. UA has a huge amount of money invested in RnD and are on the forefront of athletic technology, this helps explain their P/E in the 40's that investors are so scared of. They are also in the trend (BUZZ WORD) of fashion when in comes to casual athletic (casletic if youre a valley girl) wear. 

All in all there is too much upside to this company. They have everything to gain with the slipping giant that is Nike and their fearless leader.

For example if i want to lose all my money in high volatility penny stocks then i should be able to. Also even though i have instant it still takes 3 business days for me to receive my money. In 3 days the world can change and all my research becomes worthless. If you've never traded before download it to lose money and figure out how the market works and then switch. ",2

16-07-15,4t0ia2,Get in TGD (again) -- To thine mooneth,"I made the mistake of bouncing out of TGD before they released their production counts.  I made the topic earlier this week, but my prediction was off by ONE day and I made next to nothing off of TGD on the recent spike.

That said, take a look at this comment from their report:

&gt; “Gold ounces produced this quarter increased by 13% over the same period last year. Production for the quarter exceeded expectation due to the pit yielding more tonnes at a higher grade with a lower strip ratio than plan. We have successfully implemented multiple cost reductions this year (including mine-site G&amp;A, mining and cyanide cost reduction), ...

+13%!  Not to mention they held a bit of extra gold over from Q1 and sold in Q2 likely while prices were higher.

Gold price ranged from 1060-1230 in Q1, averaging around 1175.  In Q2, gold price ranged from 1200-1300 and averaged around 1245.  Obviously some of this is priced in.  TGD was trading at 0.07 at the beginning of January 2016.

They've also raised guidance for Q2 today:

http://www.com-unik.info/timmins-gold-corp-tmm-to-post-q2-2016-earnings-of-0-04-per-share-national-bank-financial-forecasts/

The tipping point for me is that we are experiencing a healthy pullback from the Brexit gold jump of over 100 points, as we are *down* nearly 30 points over the past week--and TGD is still *green* on the week.  Market fear isn't over, and analysts are expecting red days in the near future.

Get in before the weekend and we'll gap up until ER on (estimated) *JULY 28th*.

# Description
Exelon Corporation is a utility services holding company. The Company operates through nine segments consisting of Exelon Generation Company, LLC's (Generation's) six power marketing segments, including Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New England, New York, ERCOT and other regions; Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd); PECO Energy Company (PECO), and Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BGE). 

## Recent financials 

Revenues have been doing well in the last while but the earnings and dividend trajectory is anything but impressive.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $29.4bn | $27.4bn | $24.9bn | $23.5bn | $19.1bn|
|EPS | $2.54 | $1.88 | $2.00 | $1.42 | $3.75|
|DPS | $1.24 | $1.24 | $1.46 | $2.10 | $2.10|

## Competition

When it comes to utilities, competition is really only one of the major factors to think about. There is energy prices fluctuating, regulators having a go at them, interest rates affecting their considerable debt piles, and then in terms of competition it comes in both the generation of electricity and how you deliver it to retail clients. 

To some extent competition is the slowest moving of all these factors. And regulation and energy prices can be must faster at impacting the business and stock price.

Looking at EXC versus other multiline utilities, it's not that impressive on either a margins or returns basis. Not sure if that reflects their mix / management or if it's a potential opportunity for them. Anyone got a view?

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|Leverage|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Exelon Corporation | $28,190M | 29% | 7% | 4.3x
American Electric Power Company Inc | $15,918M | 32% | 9% | 4.0x
Consolidated Edison, Inc. | $12,094M | 29% | 9% | 4.0x

## Cash / Debt?
Exelon Corporation has $34,886M of net debt. That is 4.3x its latest operating profit. Not that far off the level of debt it's peers are willing to bear.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $36.41 for Exelon Corporation and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 0% to their target. :( So scratching my head on that...

# Valuation
The following table shows the key valuation metrics. FCF yield is lower than its peers, even though the PE ratio is also lower. Seems like the business just isn't turning the cashflow into earnings or paying it out in dividends. For a striking example look at Duke.

As a sector, am a little surprised that it's high teens PEs for a regulated industry with pedestrian growth prospects. Is it just a chase for yield?

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/exc/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
EXC | $32,289M | 15x | 3% | 3% | 11%
AEP | $34,087M | 19x | 4% | 3% | 14%
ED | $23,961M | 20x | 2% | 3% | 13%

EIX | $25,123M | 20x | 2% | 2% | 14%
PEG | $23,131M | 16x | 2% | 4% | 15%
SO | $50,316M | 19x | 3% | 4% | 14%

# Dividends
Exelon Corporation is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.26 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $1.24 per share. That is a 2% growth. The forecast dividend of $1.26 compares to a forecast EPS of $2.50. So no concerns there. Though utilities are subject to lots of restrictions by regulators on what they can and can't do with their cashflow. Obviously they don't want the lights to go out!

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 6% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -1%. On a 1 year view the stock is up 8% with earnings only up 2%. Said it before... pedestrian.

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/exc/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers. On that call they said:
&gt; we are affirming our full-year guidance range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share

I really don't know the utilities industry, so am at a loss on what the catalysts could be. Is it wholesale gas prices? Smart acquisitions? Better management? If you've got a view, please let us know. Thanks.

16-07-16,4t3dgd,3 possible outcome of $MSTX,"Outcome 1: “If vepoloxamer reduces the duration (and total dose) of IV opioids by 20+ hours in the overall population, as well as among children and those on HU, we would expect MSTX’s shares to more than double.”

Outcome 2: “At 30% probability, we view this as the most likely outcome, with reductions in IV opioid durations that are 16+ hours less than standard of care. We don’t expect the secondary outcomes will have to be met to be approved, but with 16+ hour reductions, we would expect to see improvements in the secondary outcomes.”

Outcome 3: “While less likely, it is possible vepoloxamer treatment produces a reduction in the duration of IV opioids for the entire patient set, but “misses” on either kids or HU patients. Another surprising outcome may include an unbalance on the secondary outcomes.”

I am a newbie investor that has just been approved on the robinhood app. As soon as I was approved I dropped $1000 on some stocks that I had read about on the internet. I had shares in $NVDA $PTX $ONVO $VIG $VOO. Truthfully I felt like I hadn't done enough research but I told myself that I was just practicing and that it was okay to lose out because i was learning.

I used to work at $MKTO, and my boss was totally fucking cool. He road a motorcycle to work and those things are fucking fast. So one day before the IPO, yes I was there PRE-IPO so I killed it, my boss called this cunt a cunt. He didn't get fired but that was because it was 2013 you dummies.

So my boss was friends with this short dude at doubledutch, $DD. He was VP of Solutions Consulting. WAS.  The dude got fucken shit-canned. That's right faggots. Listen to the horn of my fucking yacht. 

$DD is a company that makes event software. And less companies are doing events. So that means, they are spending less on marketing, which means their pipelines are all drying up.

Analysts currently estimate Marriott's earnings at a record high 0.98 which sounds like a tall order compared to 0.87 in Q1 but Marriott has a history of beating estimates consistently. In fact they delivered a beat 10 out of 12 times over the last three years. Better yet 4 times they beat record high expectations.

All that analysts expect of Transocean in Q2 is not to lose money. RIG has remained profitable and beat the consensus for every quarter even after 2014. Crude prices averaged about 33% higher in the second quarter than the first and drilling is slowly ramping back up so I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that RIG will probably beat the expectation of zero.

16-07-16,4t58am,Most in depth MSTX DD,"Credit to Trader-Blogger Blink. His analysis is brilliant. Please note his disclosure and all credit goes to him.

$MSTX Does the EPIC Ph 3 have a 99.9999% chance of failure? 

""The treatment difference between vepoloxamer and placebo only starts to become apparent after 80-120 hours. My investor source views this delayed response as an insurmountable problem because vepoloxamer is administered only for the first 48 hours of the study. The drug's half life is 4-6 hours. Mast's study also doses vepoloxamer for 48 hours.""

""There's simply no way vepoloxamer could be responsible for the separation of the treatment curves at 80-120 hours given the exposure profile of the drug, my investor source believes.""

I am glad someone, anyone, has finally given a bearish view on the science, but to me this seems like a fairly simplistic view. This is a complex story and one needs to dig into all the publicly available information on the development of Vepoloxmer to properly review the current phase 3 trial known as EPIC.

Firstly, the ""investor source"" is looking at the VERY poorly designed phase 3 of Poloxamer-188, published in JAMA 2001. Despite all of its shortcomings and vs EPIC: 1) The trial was underpowered as it was designed to enroll 350 patients and only enrolled 255 due to capital constraints. 2) The primary endpoint was limited to 168 hours. 3) Only 29% of those enrolled were under 15 yrs old 4) Only 21% were on concurrent Hydroxyurea + P-188 and 5) Muddy endpoint of ""time to discharge, the trial barely missed hitting its primary endpoint , N=249 p=.072, however among the 255 randomized patients, the results were deemed statistically significant, N=255, p=.04. Incidentally, the curves actually start to separate at around 70 hrs for the peds and those on concurrent Hydroxyurea and a subgroup analysis for these 2 groups showed statistically significant results that were ""very encouraging"" (according to JAMA) 

""VERY ENCOURAGING""
""Nevertheless, the decrease in the duration of vaso-occlusive crisis and increase in the proportion of patients able to achieve crisis resolution, particularly in children, are very encouraging. It is possible that children exhibit a better response to PP188 because they have less overall tissue and organ damage due to previous crises and experience less chronic pain, thereby making more evident the rheologic and anti-inflammatory effects of PP188. A beneficial effect was also observed in patients who received hydroxyurea along with PP188. This could be due to a cooperative or even a synergistic effect between these 2 agents, one that might be a result of decreased adhesion of sickle erythrocytes to the microvascular endothelium or to some other less well-defined mechanism. Future studies of PP188 in sickle cell crisis would be useful to confirm the efficacy observed in children and to determine the nature of the interaction between PP188 and hydroxyurea.
http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=194337

The ""investor source"" is looking at the primary endpoint in the JAMA study, ""time to patient hospital discharge"", which was a very muddy endpoint and based upon the availability of the treating ER physician to allow the patient to leave, which could of been many hours longer ( 5, 10, 20 hrs??)then necessary. Also in this study, the physician could keep the SCD patient hospitalized for any reason, SCD related or not. EPIC has a very pure primary endpoint that is driven by pain ""time from last opioid use""(measured via patient controlled analgesia, PCA etc) not ""time to discharge"". EPIC has no mandatory pain scale measurements 

Secondly, a healthy circulatory system is imperative in maintaining healthy organ function, and adequate bloodflow, this is especially important in Sickle Cell patients where blood flow in the microcirculation can often be comprised, especially during a Vaso Occlusive Crisis. Vepoloxamer is NOT a pain drug it is a drug that is designed to improve microvascular blood flow and hence to shorten the duration of the Vaso Occlusive Crisis which in turn should reduce organ damage (and perhaps increase survival materially over a lifetime?)

Yes Vepoloxamer (a rheologic agent) is administered for ""only"" 48 hours, but it adheres, seals (patches) and repairs the ruptured cell membranes, restoring the cells non adhesive properties and improving microvascular blood flow. It then releases from the membrane when density normalizes and it is cleared renally, unmetabolized. Vepoloxamer reduces the degree of adhesion to the walls of the vessels and to other ruptured red blood cells, which should lead to less occlusion and less pain. So a ""delayed"" response to the drug to fully engage seems not only plausible but totally reasonable. .

Has the ""investor source"" ever seen data showing that the Vepoloxamer ""patch"" becomes ""unattached"" after 48 hours from the damaged RBC membranes? Is it not possible that Vepoloxamer's RBC repair may well exceed the drugs half life of 4-6 hours? Is it possible Vepoloxamer has a durable and cumulative effect of improving microvascular blood flow and that's why it's working for SCD patients, especially kids and those on concurrent HU? Why does the ""investor source"" even assume that the assessment of the endpoint in the JAMA study was even allowed prior to completion of the 48-hr drug administration? Vepoloxamer is not WD-40, it is not just a lubricant, it repairs(patches) ruptured RBCs.

What about the P-188 Phase 2 trial which showed statistically significant shorter crisis and less opioid use?? (for which the placebo didn't even reach 96hrs) See subgroup 3, full dose patients N=31, duration of painful crisis 44hrs vs placebo 80 hrs, or a 36 hr decrease. P=.02.
http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/90/5/2041?sso-checked=true

What about Vepoloxamer in chronic heart failure which showed statistically significant improvements lasting up to two weeks! (I guess Vepo can have an effect after 80-120 hrs??)
""The Company previously announced that a single, two-hour infusion of MST-188 improved left ventricular systolic function that was significant immediately (at the end of MST-188 administration) and remained significant at one week (and, in some cases, at two weeks) after MST-188 administration. In particular, MST-188 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction, end-systolic volume, stroke volume and cardiac output."" 
http://masttherapeutics.com/investors/news/?releaseid=1900672

Why EPIC should be positive:

1)Vepoloxamer worked very well in the 1st failed phase 3 trial for children,(duration of crisis 21 hours less; P = .01) This makes sense because vessels are less damaged and more accessible in younger patients. After 250 patients enrolled in EPIC, 79% are children with average an average age of 15. The 1st failed Phase 3 only had 29% under 15 yrs old.

2) In the 1st failed phase 3 trial those patients taking concurrent Hydroxyurea (HU) +P-188 showed a duration of crisis of 16 hours less ; P =.02. In EPIC, 60% of patients are on Vepoloxamer +(HU) vs only 21% in the failed Phase 3. If 30% had been on HU in the 1st failed trial, the trial would of hit statistical significance on this one metric alone.

3) The first Phase 3’s endpoint was limited to a maximum of 168 hours. The JAMA exhibits shows that there was a clear, increasing separation between Vepoloxamer and placebo arms and that a majority of enrolled patients were not resolved after 168 hours, but marked as a censored value. It's very interesting to note that 72% of the peds in the placebo group were still in the hospital AFTER 168 hrs. It would appear vepoloxamer would have continued to show superiority after 168 hours, yet those results were not reflected in the first Phase 3. In EPIC there is no such cutoff, patients are marked when they leave the hospital.

JAMA Comments on the 168 hr cutoff:
""It is important to emphasize that in an earlier phase 2 study, even greater benefits with PP188 had been observed.19 This disparity may be explained at least in part by the assumptions used in our definition of crisis duration, the primary end point in this study. Specifically, we observed that fewer patients achieved crisis resolution within 168 hours than patients in the earlier pilot study had led us to anticipate.19 The current study used a very stringent definition of crisis resolution, one that required repeated assessments of pain throughout the entire hospitalization, including the period following discontinuation of parenteral analgesics. In a number of instances, patients were discharged from the hospital before pain relief had been confirmed by a second pain assessment. In still other instances, study patients were discharged before the criteria for crisis resolution had been met. In either case, the analysis plan required that these patients be considered as treatment failures and that the worst-case duration of crisis (ie, 168 hours) be imputed for them""

""Use of an extremely stringent definition of crisis resolution represented a very conservative approach to the analysis of the data. Because the proportion of patients achieving crisis resolution within 168 hours was lower than anticipated, the ability of this study to detect differences in the length of crisis was correspondingly smaller than expected.39 The work reported here also differed from the earlier phase 2 study in that treatment assignment was made according to the stratified dynamic randomization method of Pocock and Simon.28 For these reasons, the statistical analysis methods used in this study were conservative. While less conservative methods might have shown substantially greater differences between the study populations, such an analysis plan would have required taking into account the use of the randomization method.

4) EPIC was designed based upon the assumption that the mean duration of VOC would be 96 hours with a standard deviation of 51 hours. The interim look in October after 250 patients showed the mean duration of patients on I.V. Opioids to be 79 hours, with a standard deviation of 47 hrs. The three doctors on the recent expert calls all said, the 79 hour mean duration is ""encouraging"". If the 96 hour assumption holds up, EPIC results should be highly positive
FYI- (1998 hospital stay was 5.38 days and in 2008 was 5.18 days,(overall) Peds right at 96 hrs(see Figure F3))

Evaluation of EPIC

Although the stock certainly trades poorly and appears to have a total EPIC miss nearly priced in, I certainly do not believe that Vepoloxamer has a ""99.9999%"" chance of failure. In fact, if you seriously look at all the Vepoloxamer information publicly available for the last 15-20 years , it would appear to have a very high chance of success. Mast has completed enrollment in the largest placebo-controlled clinical SCD trial conducted to date when most said they couldn't even do that, yet they receive zero recognition. The Company appears to be preparing to file a very robust NDA package. Julie Kanter, Hematologist and lead investigator running the EPIC trial at MUSC recently used a few adjectives to describe Vepoloxamer, ""incredible potential"", ""game changer"". Two other SCD experts on recent calls also had very positive things to say about the drug as well. These SCD experts seem to see something they like. I personally have never seen such a disconnect in my life, we will know all of the answers shortly. Good luck to anyone involved.

16-07-17,4t7viy,How to compare expense ratio affects between funds,"I'm using the [Financial Industry Regulatory Authority tool](http://apps.finra.org/fundanalyzer/1/fa.aspx) for analyzing the affects of fund expenses.  When using the tool, you specify a symbol, and then you specify an investment amount, return rate, and length.  When specifying the return rate, should i be using the average annualized rate of return, so if I specify a length of 10, I should specify the funds 10 year average annualized rate of return?  This question doesn't have to be specific to the tool I am using, but any tool which breaks out the yearly expenses and profit.

Further, let's say I am comparing two funds, fund A with an expense ratio of .10, and fund B with an expense ratio of .80.  If the 10 year average return of fund B is higher than fund A where fund B makes more profit than fund A, even with a .80 expense ratio, doesn't it make sense to go with fund B?  This is for a rollover IRA, so I do not believe fund trading causing short term/long term gains matters at the moment (though I could be wrong).",1

Is there anything bad about this? Like let's say you end up trading 10 apple shares at $100 each. Is someone going to come after you?

Also if you found an extremely illiquid penny stock, bought $500 for $0.01 each in an IRA and then placed them for sale at $1.00 each, and then all of a sudden got an urge to enter a fat finger panic buy order on your normal brokerage account for $1 each you end up buying from yourself.

Are both of these scenarios illegal, or just second one?

Edit: also what happens if there are no limit orders on the books and someone places a market buy order the same time someone places a market sell order? Will the trades be exectuted or will they need to wait for limit orders to be added?",3

I think Twitter is going through a major rebranding, away from a tweeting/messaging-blog platform to something more substantial. They've started with Moments, and is now branching into livestreaming. This gives Twitter a lot more to work with in terms of revenue and is something that would retain users and get people to sign up. We also see that companies love them as a platform-- preferring them over other companies.

I think Twitter is no longer being propped up-- the bubble has burst.

 While all of that is acceptable and many laughs can be had when bold calls are made stating that you are going to YOLO against  the trend only to get rekt as expected.

*  All this is great provided that these trades were made with real money.  
 
*  To be absolutely clear.  **No one gives a fuck about your paper trades.**
  
The extent of which some of you will go through to gain any any legitimacy in your life such as using  multiple accounts and forging screenshots is understandable since you have nothing better to do since you aren't really trading.  Even worse is to try and pass off bullshit as real.

However,  to post a 6 minute video of ""PROOF"" in which 5:40 of those  consisted of nothing but a laptop booting up is beyond ridiculous.  The amount of time wasted to create that video is better spent on planning your own suicide.  

* Going forward, bullshit to this degree is no longer tolerated in /r/wallstreetbets.

I manage my finances as a 23 year old finishing up my final semester of BS in finance with 3 types of accounts. i have my checking/savings, my investment account (option house) and my roth IRA. currently my roth with vanguard has the VFFVX fund.
It is a target retirement fund for 2055 and is a mixture of about 90% stocks 10% bonds. It allocates more space to bonds the closer it gets to retirement. This is great for me since i study the markets everyday and i can not worry about that since I'm actively trading in my other brokerage account. I just want a lazy portfolio once i have 3k to disperse into each of their low fee admiral shares. ( i think its total bond, stock, international, and REITs)
But for now is there a better choice for me? I have seen the ETF's have lower expense fee and they are a bit more liquid so i see the gains have been slightly higher. Am i wasting time with the VFFVX fund or should i just leave it there until retirement ?

Short summary: I am about to spend at least 2 years where (out of the country) I will not need any housing or have any housing expense.  My current home has been heavily renovated and even conservatively I expect to receive around $100,000 on the sale.  As I won't be buying a replacement home for 2+years, I am looking for a relatively safe investment for this money.

Even though I'm looking at low risk options; I'm not totally risk averse here.  I am hoping to stay away from high risk of course.  It is also not important that I make a lot of money on the investment but would (as anyone would) love to be able to make something with my money.

16-07-17,4taiik,"My beginner, mostly philosophical, investment strategy (feedback appreciated)","I'm a software engineer who recently start dabbling with the stock market using Robinhood. I think that without a clear plan and enter/exit strategies and numbers, then investing is no different from gambling. Here is my plan:

###Investment Strategy

1. Long-term investment = buy/hold stock for 1+ years based on company value
2. Short-term investment = buy/sell stock in short time based on market events

Hypothetical:

1 year of trading ~ 250 trading days.

Need .56% return everyday to make 4x initial capital:
(1.0056)^250 = 4.0

For ""guaranteed"" returns everyday, you can't do long-term investments because of unexpected short-term volatility.  **So, focus on short-term investments.**

###Investment Approach

1. Wait for probable market moving event in a sector
2. Look for trends in that sector
3. Buy/sell the ""best"" trend for +.56%

--- 

1. is simple enough.
2. is complicated. Find a trend by looking for suspect changes in price in a given time.
3. is simple enough. Buy/sell the most volatile stock following that trend.

---

False Assumptions:

- there aren't market moving events everyday
- assume ""best"" trend is always the most volatile one which isn't always true

###Example

1. EIA Petroleum Status Report came out last week on Thursday. 
2. Noticeable negative trends on oil equities right after report released.
3. Buy extremely volatile oil stock DWTI after it jumps from +2% to +6% in 30 seconds after report. Sell it at end of day at ~+12%

###Main Problem to the Approach

How the **FUCK** do I determine 2.? That is the hardest problem for this strategy right now. Definitely need to use real-time mathematical modeling. Feedback about this problem is most appreciated.

Prior to joining banking, my investing experience has entirely been in US equity markets, but for the past few months I've been happy to let my money sit in a robo-adviser account (Wealthfront/Betterment). I have almost zero exposure to macro investing (currency, commodities, etc.)

Holding stock worries me at the moment, as I think valuations are quite rich and the risk/reward has become unfavorable.

Essentially, what I would like to do is put most of my savings into a safe, relatively low-yield account, while putting a small portion of money into betting on an market downturn in the next few years. I have no illusion that I can accurately predict the likelihood/timing of the next recession, but I'd like to get some exposure to instruments that have low cost but have high payoffs in case something calamitous does happen in the next 3-5 years.

Am I looking for something that doesn't exist? Again, while I generally understand principles behind vanilla equity investing, I am completely new to the concept of market timing/macro investing. Any suggestions/educational resources would be greatly appreciated.",4

Lets take a minute to go over the basics, their Balance Sheet. 

* $65MM Cash on hand (enough to last them 1.5 years)  
* $78.31MM Stockholder equity (compared to $398MM market cap.)     
* $2.5MM revs last quarter with -$12.5MM operating loss 


So, essentially the financials are pretty shitty, but for a mostly clinical stage biopharmaceutical company, they're pretty decent. At least the stockholder equity is positive, compared to say... MSTX?

Right now they have 2 products on the market:

1) Relistor® SC (AI) for OIC Advanced Illness    
2) Relistor® SC (CP) for OIC Chronic Pain   

The new Relistor that they are seeking approval for today is for OIC Chronic Pain, but, this time it's in oral form. 

""The pipeline is solid right now. They have got a few oncology drugs going through phase 2 - phase 3 trials such as Small Molecule Diagnostic 1404, which is a diagnostic tool specifically developed for prostate cancer imaging. You can read about the rest on their website becuase I'm not really playing this long term. But the main catalyst here is the oral version of Relistor, which treats the source of constipation caused by opioids without affecting the pain relief from opioid therapy. Drugs like this are not new to the world, however it's approval is going to push PGNX to at least $7 a share when it gets approved.""

This oral form is really important due to ease of use. I'm do doctor or heroin addict but I'd rater pop a pill than stick some dirty needle into my arm with questionable substances. Also, they're fucking working with Valeant. If that isn't a huge vote of confidence, then I don't know what is. $VRX doesn't joke fuck around (except for fucking Ackman in the un-lubed butthole) and they've got a solid marketing partnership going. I know Valeant isn't very hot right now but who gives a fuck if the drug works, it doesn't matter who's selling it, it's getting sold. 

""The PDUFA for oral Relistor is July 19th and it's going to be approved no problem. The FDA even said ""Among the opioid receptor antagonists in development for OIC, Relistor has been the most extensively evaluated in the nonclinical, clinical, and post-marketing settings"", yeah, the FDA ha practically already fucking approved this bitch"". 

""Now to the business side of things. $PGNX will get a 50 million milestone payment if Oral Relistor is aproved. Based on the numbers(50 million milestone payment and new revenue from Oral Relistor and growing royalties payed form Reilstor) the company has a shot to turn a profit by the end of this year."" This is important because not only is it going to add value to the company (duh) but with 3 drugs on the market it's going to provide them increased revenues AND a huge cash runway to pay for all their other drugs in clinical trials. 

So what the fuck does this mean? It means the PGNX is going to the fucking moon. They're getting their drug approved, $50MM in milestone payments and defenitely getting bought out.

NFLX is a fluke. Their profit margins are getting eaten by distributors, competitors are popping left and right, growth is slowing and they had their time. They are the next Myspace, in a way. Something much better will come along.

Tomorrow, NFLX will plateau for good. After decades of very impressive growth, it willl finally reach its zenith. Why? Because distributors will soon launch their own services. See HBO now which is a massive success and tell me others won't follow.

16-07-18,4td4a8,"Originally a reply in a dead thread - Why I don't think Go will make good profits in the long term","This is just a reply to guy seeming to think Go is going to be some long term moneymaker so it'll read weird as a straight up post. You'll all have to deal with it.

________________________________________________

OK realistically lets judge this based on the actual mechanics in play and not your facebook feed, the frontpage of reddit and some nebulous concept of brand recognition and loyalty. The fact is the entire concept of Go is built around this explosive release. Think about it, nothing else is going to get the news stories this game does. Thus the hype. But as time goes on there's first the inevitable dropoff, as will always happen, but with less press becomes less interest, and that's more important for this game which is like an MMO in that as less and less people play more and more people stop playing - it works with a big community and bigger is always better. But the decline then becomes sharper than any other type of game. You can't genuinely believe that these same people are going to be doing their two hour 'PokeWalks' in big groups providing endless advertising come the future, this is always going to be a short term thing for a high portion of the userbase just due to the hype.

But that's besides the point because we care about the profits this is turning. Firstly, a lower userbase not only removes people buying shit but also in a game like this removes the peer pressure to buy shit, so again a steeper decline in purchases with lower userbase. Then think about what this game actually is. We need to consider, does it have a compelling endgame that people will continue to buy into. I don't think so, there's a reason Ingress never got massive, because it's not compelling to keep going for a long period of time. Compare this game to Clash Royale - in that game there's always someone else to beat or someone to stay above, so you keep buying to make sure you are in that position. In Go, what is there, some desire to hold gyms in your area based on retaining your compulsion to walk around and shit. That won't last. I'm not justifying that statement but I don't think many people will disagree with it. Even assuming people will still dedicate their movements to the game (they won't), there's not enough competition to care about whether or not your team owns the gyms and so on. Why do you give a shit.

So that's not the endgame we want. There's also the other endgame of catching all the Pokemon, and that one is compelling yes. But it's limited in the fact that when it's over, it's over. And that's important, insanely so. Here we compare again to Clash Royale, that game in infinite in its endgame essentially, but here the endgame stops. So let's consider the actual business model of Go and any F2P game. It's the whale model, the idea that about only 1% (I don't know the actual number but it's small as shit) will buy anything in your game, but they will often buy a large amount of that anything. These are your profits, these whales. Clash Royale takes their money over and over as they compete against other whales, and they rake it in. In Go, the endgame means even the whales stop giving you money, and given the large amount of purchases expected from a whale that endgame will be quickly achieved, meaning that the profit stream will fall off very fast.

This is a bit of a ramble but I'm sure it's fucking readable so let's conclude. There are many pros to Go, yes, but it's super naive to think that this is some endless money stream going into Ninetendo's pocket. The speculation about Apple and Niantic cuts aren't even noted here because we're merely looking at the profit structure in place, and I'd like to think I've explained why it likely won't be as successful as other F2P mobile games in the long run. If I was long on Nintendo I'd want that expansion with more pokemon ASAP because that'll see a big burst again, but who knows. But again, this doesn't translate directly to NTDOY and we all know that. The NX, sun / moon, other mobile release potentials etc etc mean that NTDOY may well be very bullish short and long term but if you're trying to justify holding long because of some massive Go money I don't think that's wise, make sure you know what you're getting into.

TL;DR

* The MMO-Esque nature means that any dropoff in userbase contributes to a further dropoff. This means any declines in numbers will show much steeper drops than most games. This is amplified by the fact it's a hype machine right now and that just cannot last. This is important for profits as many purchases are semi-peer pressured with people doing stuff in groups, so more dropoff and less and less money, again showing steep drops.
* Lacking 'endgame' model means no infinite income from 'whales', when they're done collecting the Pokemon they have no further reason to dump in cash. Unlike most F2P games therefore the profits will dry up soon after any new Pokemon are added unless a more compelling endgame is implemented.",5

I presumed the term to mean the average of the previous 12 months of data, but I'm apparently mistaken.  The former source writes, ""the unemployment rate [for February '16] is at an 8 year low at 4.9% and well below its 12-month average of 6.27%."" The average of the month in question and the previous 12 months would be in the [low 5s](http://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet); if it means the past 12 Februaries, it would be 6.7%.  

The latter article notes that March '07 was a point of unemployment going higher than its 12-month moving average (a recession signal) when it actually dropped from either of the two types of calculations (previous 12 months, previous 12 Marches).

This is keeping the real estate market floating but significant weakness in high end housing spells trouble. While many areas across the United States are showing increases in housing prices, this is mostly in middle to low end housing. Once you move north of $1+ million, demand has cratered. Why? The upper income buyers have too many questions about the future of housing in relation to the domestic and global economy. In many areas, housing has jumped dramatically from the 2010-12 lows, some places it is approaching the highs from 2007. The wealthy tend to be more housing savvy in regards to finding a good deal. They are also the buyers who use all cash, meaning they are less likely to care about interest rates being a historic lows. The high end real estate buyers are more likely to follow the global news and realize Europe is a mess, Brexit may have a long lasting impact and the United States election in November could have major consequences. Canadian buyers have also left the high end United States markets because of the collapse in oil from over $100 per barrel. While it has recovered somewhat, they are not yet inching back into the market.

Ultimately, high end real estate weakness may be a signal of a downturn in all of housing. Smart money is usually the first to leave the market. The scariest of all is what will happen if interest rates rise even a tiny bit. Look for a major slow down to spread from $1+ million housing into all of housing.

It might not look much for those of you who are trading with over thousands of dollars but as for percentage wise, I think I managed it pretty well as a beginner XD


I didn't have any prior experience on stock trading and just started off with couple hundred dollars to see how I would perform. (Which I'm pretty sure this is how most beginners are starting off.)

I did my research on all companies that I was interested in before I made my initial trade and tried not to listen to anyone who would tell me to buy this and that especially when I had no idea of what those companies were.

I never timed the market and didn't really panic when the companies that I invested on had dips here and there. I held onto them knowing that they will eventually go up (with a research) and this method has been working pretty well for me so far.


For those of you who might wonder what I invested in, most of my earnings are from ATVI, NVDA and AMD. (I'm currently working in the IT field and tech stocks are what I'm most familiar of.) I've invested in DIS, MSFT and few others here and there but I only made little off of them.


Investing in a Roth IRA and a stock market was the best decision that I've made last year and I'm grateful to have these extra earnings following along.


I'm not an expert in anyway but if anyone who are trying to start their first trading is in need of help, I'll be more than happy to help! :)

&amp;nbsp;

Edit1. I usually setup a line and once that line has been hit, I put a stop loss with a certain % above the initial price. So let's say your stock was up 10% from $5.00 to $5.50. Then I would decide a certain % (let's say 5% in this case) and setup a stop loss at $5.25. In this case I would still be making some profit even if the stock falls. :)

Edit2. I don't time the market :) I usually buy and hold. I didn't start (and didn't expected) stock trading to double or triple my money within few months. I started it simply thinking that investing on a stock market would be a better option than my savings account ;)",76

$AMD $5.56 +0.42 (+8.16%)
Is at a four-year high today, and it's potentially a great day to sell if you have been holding many shares for a while now. If you entered in at the $1.XX range 6 months ago or more, it could be a good idea to sell. 

However, I have not entered any positions in my career as of yet, and I am pondering on buying at it's new price in the event that it might go higher. AMD is coming out with new hyper-threading/multi-threading technology that has been deemed comparable to Intel processing and technology in the near future. July 21st is the next earnings call. 

How do you guys feel about entering in this current state/price, even though it is suggested by many sources to sell, for example TheStreet.

As listed the VAS (Vanguard Australian Shares Index Fund) is averaging ~7%, however, looking at the actual price of the stock (see: https://au.finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=VAS.AX#symbol=VAS.AX;range=1y) it doesn't really look similar and it's just making me very confused (because of the drops etc).

Does it include dividends as well as the general price of the ETF? Or am I on the wrong track completely?

(1) risk-free rates = 1% and expected stock returns = 6%  (This is arguably what the current situation roughly looks like.)

(2) risk-free rates = 5% and expected stock returns = 10%  (The good old days?)

16-07-18,4th0k0,"Completely new to investing, and have a few questions that the sidebar links couldnt answer.","First off, I want to say that I have read the sidebar links and have been reading up on Investopedia and other sites to get my feet wet with terminology and the basics.  I feel I have enough basics to at least open up an account and ease into investing.  There are a few things I'd like some help on that some of the sidebar links could not help me with.


**My background**

* 28 years old.

* Employed full time (~63k/yr). Wife makes ~38k (The joys of being an inner city school teacher!)

* Risk tolerance: **this I need advice with**.  I feel I should be riskier now as I'm fairly young, but my wife and I work very hard for what we have and I would like to just make the SMART choice.

* Current holdings: my wife and I both have retirement accounts at our respective jobs, but thats it.

* Debts: My wife is still paying off student loans and car. Also 4 years into our mortgage. No credit card debt. 

* We have a savings account for emergencies with about $3,000.

* I have about $1,000 to invest at the moment.  I will probably start in $100-$300 range though, and then add a little bit to it out of each pay (maybe like $50-$75).



**My 401k**

* Roth IRA (5% contribution)

* Company match: $1,500/year max (I know.. terrible..)

* Amount: ~22k

* Allocation: based off of available choices and advice given to me over in r/personalfinance, I have the following %'s: 


Vanguard Total International Stock Index Inv: 31.94%

Vanguard Extended Market Index Adm: 10.45%

Vanguard 500 Index Admiral: 38.5%

Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Adm: 19.11%



**Objective**

Long term investing, not necessarily retirement. Once I get more involved and educated, I'll probably pursue shorter-term investments as well.



**Questions and Advice Topics**

1. I downloaded the Robinhood app (no transaction fees or minimum account balance), and put $250 in there to start. Has anyone used this app? Are there any downfalls that I'm overseeing? It seems that it does not give all the available 

2. I plan on adding $50-$75 per pay going forward into the Robinhood account.  Since there are no transaction fees, I assume its not an issue to buy in small increments here and there?

3. What is a good place to start?  I'd like to ease in with a few index/mutual/ETF funds. I figure I already have Vanguard for my 401k, so I'd like to diversify this new account by starting with other low annual fee index/mutual/ETF funds. Is this even a good idea?  

4. Can I get an ELI5 the difference between index, mutual, and ETF?  I have read [this article](http://time.com/money/3938695/index-exchange-traded-funds-mutual-fund-difference/) but its still a little confusing.

5. Any other general advice and discussions are welcome!  I am still trying to learn. If I missed something important, please let me know and I'll update this.  


Thank you all in advance for giving me your time.

For those that fish in these ponds, how do you keep track of those subsequent amendments in a manner that allows you to review the information prior to the distribution date? Or, is is that you simply do not know in advance, and part of the ""gamble"" it taking a position in the hopes of a speedy resolution?

For example, in the case of Danaher and Fortive, what submission would have let me know the cut-off date and ratio details in advance? It's not of much use to know on June 15th that the cut-off is June 15th...

16-07-18,4th785,"What does ""debt aggregation facility"" mean?","Received an IR letter today from SolarCity saying that they:

&gt;In addition to the $345 million in new funds, SolarCity also expanded its existing **debt aggregation facility** to $760 million, an increase of $110 million. SolarCity added two new lenders to the facility, which accounted for $70 million of the $110 million upsize.

I did some googling as I don't understand this term, but didn't get much further beyond the definition of ""account aggregation"" from investopedia. Does this mean that they increased their total (used+available) credit across all lenders to $760MM?

 And for the second part: Does it mean that one or several of their previous lenders/investors agreed to increase their credit by $40MM, which may mean that they(the lenders) have an increased/continued belief in SolarCity?

What does the term mean? English is my second language, and the translation in google translate makes zero sense.

16-07-19,4tkein,Question about New IPO release (Line Corp:LN),"So I am wondering about the usual release and this so called ""joined"" release with JPM and others (ADS) mainly for simplification of tax issues between countries.

In a usual release, if they say the company will sell 20M shares with starting price at $10, I assume until the first 20M all sold, it is $10 and would all be released at once?
After that the prices changes as trade goes.

Line release 25M (for US more for Japan) at starting price of $32.5 , but none of them were sold at that price. The first bid/ask was $42/43. Also, it seems only 10M were traded in the first 1/2 hour and maybe less than 25M the whole day. So if I had a buy at market price at $32.5 with limit of $40 how come I didn't get any?! How come know-one got any? Who had them?

I'm thinking of a way to activate the WSB crowd, since we are all clueless, gambling, individuals by using an experiment.


**The idea is the following:**

I would make a very simple weekly survey with the following question.

*""On a 1 week horizon your advice for stock X is: BUY/SELL"".*

Afterwards I would add a few follow-up questions to filter on things like, age, years experience, years WSB subscriber,... . 
The idea is to do this for a couple of weeks untill I might (or might not) find a correlation between a certain profile and a reliable estimation (even if it's inverse). Then I would redo the survey again and share the results. 

Not sure if there would be enough participation but if there would be, I would still need some input on the following questions:

- what stocks should I use (highest volume? most discussed on Reddit?,..?)

- how many stocks should I put in the survey? Too much risks answer of people don't know anything about them.

- what should the frequency be? I'm thinking of once a week, every Saturday when the markets are closed.

- what should the investment horizon for the question be? A week might be to short.


All other comments and/or suggestions are more then welcome.

This could end up in a big failure without any data (or just some random data), but could also just might work...


**[EDIT]**
The goal is not to find a guy that is a trading oracle. The goal is to find a group (by distillation) who give reliable results. I shouldn't matter whether they are right or wrong, as long as they are reliable.

# Description

According to their filing: 

&gt; Rockwell Automation is a provider of industrial automation power, control and information solutions for manufacturers. The Company operates through two segments: Architecture &amp; Software and Control Products &amp; Solutions. 

To me that's pretty hard to understand. So a whizz round their website including investor relations, sadly sheds little light. Seems that Rockwell is one of those amazing businesses that we consumers never hear of. Factories all over the world are filled with their equipment, be it safety gear, electronics, production line machinery, etc.

Sure there are the companies that manufacture the products we buy, but who are the companies that manufacture the plants that manufacture the products we buy? Well Rockwell is one of them.

## Recent financials 

The top line's not had a great time recently, even though the EPS and divie have improved nicely. Why's that:

&gt; In 2015, sales were $6,307.9 million, a decrease of 4.8 percent year over year. Organic sales increased 1.1 percent, and currency translation reduced sales by 6.0 percent. The modest organic growth was led by the consumer and automotive industries, offset by significant headwinds from heavy industries, particularly the oil and gas industry.


|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $6.3bn | $6.6bn | $6.4bn | $6.3bn | $6.0bn|
|EPS | $6.09 | $5.91 | $5.36 | $5.13 | $4.80|
|DPS | $2.60 | $2.32 | $1.98 | $1.75 | $1.48|

## Competition
In terms of the competition:

&gt; Our competitors range from large diversified corporations that also have business interests outside of industrial automation to smaller companies that specialize in niche industrial automation products, solutions and services. Our major competitors of both segments include Siemens AG, ABB Ltd, Schneider Electric SA, Emerson Electric Co., Mitsubishi Electric Corp. and Honeywell International Inc.

And for the small kid, their margins and returns are great. Rivalling even the performance of the giant, Honeywell.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Rockwell Automation | $6,050M | 21% | 32%
ABB Ltd (ADR) | $34,829M | 14% | 12%
AMETEK, Inc. | $3,935M | 27% | 18%
Eaton Corporation PLC | $20,445M | 17% | 12%
Emerson Electric Co. | $20,958M | 18% | 23%
Honeywell International Inc. | $38,890M | 22% | 27%
Kyocera Corp (ADR) | $14,115M | 12% | 5%
Nidec Corporation (ADR) | $11,240M | 15% | 12%
Siemens AG (ADR) | $86,130M | 11% | 15%
TE Connectivity Ltd | $11,887M | 21% | 15%

## Cash / Debt?
Rockwell Automation has $519M of net cash. That is the equivalent of a modest 3% of the market value of Rockwell Automation.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $110.50 for Rockwell Automation and their recommendation to clients is _Hold_. That implies a downside of -7% to their target.

# Valuation

The yield is nice at 3%, the FCF is reasonable any at 20x earnings it's not cheap given the mid-single digit growth rate. But it's hard to spot a peer that looks more attractive on valuation terms? TEL perhaps?


[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/rok/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|

ABB | $44,412M | 20x | 6% | 4% | 7%
AME | $11,115M | 19x | 11% | 1% | 7%
ETN | $29,234M | 15x | 8% | 3% | 13%
EMR | $36,176M | 18x | 6% | 3% | 11%

KYO | $18,537M | 24x | N/A | 2% | 10%
NJDCY.PK | $23,765M | 24x | 15% | 1% | 6%
SIEGY.PK | $89,296M | 14x | 5% | 4% | 14%
TEL | $21,478M | 15x | 13% | 2% | 10%

# Dividends
Rockwell Automation is forecast to pay a dividend of $3.05 per share, compared with a dividend of $2.75 per share, the last 12 months.. That is a 11% growth. Pretty nice. The forecast dividend of $3.05 compares to a forecast EPS of $5.91. 

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 2% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 1%. Though that's against a backdrop of a decreased of 8% in sales.

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/rok/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers. Looking at the 8% decline in sales the management said:

&gt; Organic sales declined 3.5%. Heavy industry verticals were down globally. And growth in Latin America and EMEA was offset by declines in the US and China. I’m pleased that we have been able to keep segment margins at 20%, despite 8% lower sales.

So rather a nasty recent performance, with little in the way of positive news. They continue to expect a decline in sales for all of 2016 and for earnings to be flat to down. 

And catalysts? Well, it seems it's a play on global economic growth, though in a different way to the Coca-Cola's of this world. It's not about consumer confidence and take home plays, at least not directly. But it's a play on the nuts and bolts of the global economy. Factories, upgrading facilities, improved manufacturing efficiencies. 

This doesn't sound like a stock that engages in short-term ramps, but a steady as she goes sort of investment. And of the industrial plays, it looks pretty solid.

Pokemon is a brand owned by Nintendo (up 70% in 5 trading days) since release. However, the game itself was developed by Niantic Labs. The game is described as ""part owned"" by Nintendo.

How much is part owned, who owns the other portion? The only logical conclusion is Niantic owns some if not the remaining portion of the rights to the game. 

Who owns Niantic? They were an internal Google start up until 2015 when they were spun out as their own company. However, I haven't read any details as to the ownership. Is Google still the majority owner of Niantic labs?

If Google still owns Niantic and Niantic owns at least part of Pokemon Go, how much skin does Google have in Pokemon Go?

16-07-18,4tf2yc,"The future ain't what it used to be","The past and future…quite an oxymoronic pair that often coexist

We saw this quite literally in the past week as the meteoric rise of “Pokémon Go” shuttled us back to the 1990s, yet at the same time transported us into what the future of virtual and augmented reality could look like…taking gaming from your basement couch with a Capri Sun out into the “real” world with an actual sun. But, enough about Pokémon. 

More figuratively, the act of taking a step back can often launch us a few steps forward. And the market’s setback from Brexit was no exception, accelerating on the speed bump towards new highs in the S&amp;P and new lows for global bond yields. That kind of brazen charge forward has also been visible in the HY market where bonds gained 2.3% over the past week despite a 11.5% decline in oil prices, a downturn that would normally unnerve the HY market. But this time was different. 

While we often use the past as a guide to the future, the market is operating out of a new playbook at the moment. Just as HY shrugs off lower oil prices, at the same time, HY and IG spreads have absorbed higher rates, as the sensitivity declines relative to post-crisis peaks in mid-2014.

Chartering new territory, records have been broken as technical tailwinds gain vigor. Today, there’s the highest amount of negative yielding debt outstanding with 14% of EUR corporate bonds trading in the sub-zero camp (€216bn) and when adding in sovereign  bond, that number rises to a staggering €4.1 trillion, or 49% of the EUR bond complex. 

As negative yields fuels a global rotation to USD products, demand flourished with record inflows into HY ETFs last week ($2.6bn) and the 2nd largest ETF inflow in IG ($3.5bn). Robust demand met with anemic supply has allowed credit to sprint to the finish line, despite obstacles (rates and crude) in its way. 

**Fun fact:** After spending just $10 on an in-game purchase to attract virtual Pokémon (and thus Pokémon Go players) to their pizzeria, L’inizio’s Pizza Bar in Queens saw its business jump 30% from the previous weekend (credit goes to [REACTED])

This wouldn't be a problem except that once labeled this way you must carry 25k in your account.  My question is why?  As long as I'm not selling options why do they care for me to have 25k in my account if I'm simply buying and selling shares?

I will almost certainly never run the risk of being labeled this way, but it did make me curious.  Thank you for any help.",4
16-07-18,4ti08p,NVDA- What it looks like when irrational traders take over,"https://www.tradingview.com/x/I2UTazam/

These red lines are where I expect NVDA to hit over the next 2 quarters.

When a stock goes straight up like this and offers no other value to shareholders other than the promise of growth, that's what you'd call irrational buying. There's no incentive to hold any longer since there is no dividend. 

What happens is, the first layer will start to take their profits and it will continue and continue till it balances out somewhere near the center, whereby, original investors start to reevaluate whether its still valuable. 

So, in the next 2-3 quarters I expect it to find levels near these arrows.


EDIT:

If everyone and their mom is buying, then maybe that's a signal to get out.  Someone is going to be left holding the bag. stocktwits has  buy sentiment of 63%. Apparently reddit agrees. So who is going to be left holding the bag ?

Based on the chart, it looks like it can hit 60,IF everything keeps going according to plan. 

I just think there's too many moving parts and its priced too high for it to be worth the risk at this point. People will start to take profits. It happens. Why would you lend your money to a company and not take profits?

16-07-19,4tlk6v,Canadian Oil and Gas - help me understand the risks,"I've recently taken an interest in the oil sands and gas wells across our northern neighbor. The big boom is over, but they will keep chuggin on. My top picks:

* CNQ largest nat gas producer in Canada, not a lot of cash but pays a dividend, and these Canadians need their gas for that long cold winter. 
* ENB owns the pipelines, probably has room to grow West and South, has some debt (which I like), and pays a dividend.
* SU exploring and producing Athabasca and abroad, pays a dividend.
* PWE exploring and producing, owns a bunch of land out there, willing to sell land, and do whatever it takes to get through the hard times, seems like a good representation of the Calgary spirit. Doesn't pay a dividend, more of a bet on the region. 

So, other than risks of gas/oil prices rising and falling, and the risks inherent to each company individually, **what systemic risks should I be aware of?** Am I being an oil idiot, or does going long make sense right now?

My hypothesis is that these reserves will be tapped, and that very longterm the price of oil and gas should only be rising. The bubble popped, they've been through the price war, and they survived, and they're prepared for the long haul. I'm trying to figure out how to value these companies to know if I'm getting good prices. ",7

16-07-19,4tnx9o,Investment Strategy - Rotational Sector ETF,"I want to get your advice on my investment strategy. Yes I am trying to beat the market. Yes it is more volatile.

My strategy is simple – Rotation Sector ETF based on Momentum

To keep my cost low – I will be using Robinhood for my trades, ETFs from either Charles Schwab or Vanguard (I will be using Vanguard for this example) and obtaining Capital Gains Tax.

Momentum investing is arguably one of the most basic strategies and it has been proven with past market data that it does work. The simple definition is that investments that have performed will tend to continue to perform well and investments that have performed poorly tend to continue to perform poorly. Obviously, this doesn't happen all the time but in my opinion it happens more than it doesn't.

Here is my strategy: 
Look at Vanguard’s Sector ETFs
https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/list?assetclass=ss&amp;assetclass=ss#/etf/asset-class/month-end-returns

Sort it out by 1Y performance. 
At this time of the post, Utilities and REIT are the best performing ETFs

Invest in both ETFs equally

Wait a year and then sell it so that your gains are considered capital gains

Rinse and Repeat

Here is the youtube video that goes over it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd0BjTiFBfE

The paper that it’s based on. The paper is a bit different where it used the different sectors in the S&amp;P 500  such as XLY, XLU instead. It proved that it beats the S&amp;P 500 70% of the time.
http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1585517

You can obviously tailor the investment to your strategy. Maybe do a 3 month period instead of a 12 month period. Or instead of doing the Top 2 ETFs maybe do the Top 3. 

I have changed the strategy to make the cost as low as possible and I have included Real Estate as one of the sectors but you have the flexibility to do what you like.

16-07-19,4to14v,Next FDA Approval Play: $OCUL,"Okay friends, here's the long and short of it. In the next week (the 24th at the latest) our good buddies at the FDA are gonna sit around a table and talk about Ocular Therapeautix, a company that is up for FDA approval for their ""ocular sealant drug"". 

Now, you probably realized that the stock went down on us (unlike my girlfriend, bitch) early June... Okay, I'll tell you. One of their drugs for eyeball itching didn't achieve statistical significance, but, who gives a fuck about that? It just made the stock cheaper for us. 

OCUL is trading near it's 52 week lows and this is an excellent opportunity to buy in. 

So the drug that OCUL has up for approval is called DEXTENZA. Now, I'm looking at their top line Phase 3 trial results and they look fucking amazing. I'm not a doctor by any stretch of the imagination but I'm pretty good with numbers and 50% of their placebo group experiences ""dry eye"" or whatever the fuck they're trying to treat, compared to only 13% of their actual trial group experiencing symptoms. 

This is pretty good, lots of people are being cured by this medication. Also, they mentioned some shit about retention. I have no idea what the fuck that means but I know in some cases if 100% of your patients can hold the drug in their system for 14 days and 97% for 30 days, that's a fucking solid sign. 

Look, their drug is hot shit, if you don't believe me go look at the charts they included with their press release [here](http://www.ocutx.com/pipeline/dexamethasone-punctum-plug). In ALL cases a substantial number of patients taking the drug exhibited strong results, and, an absence of eye pain compared to their placebo group. 

Their trial results were solid and it's a super solid drug that has a real high chance of approval. Again, I'm not a doctor BUT if there is a doctor here, I'll send you the trial results and maybe you can go over them? The more people that look at this company the stronger the DD...

Also, this is a biopharm company, so, their financials don't really mean much but they're pretty solid. They have 10 quarters of cash runway so they won't really need to raise any money anytime soon. They equity is also pretty nigh. The P/B ratio for this company is less that 2 which is really fucking amazing for a drug company in their trial stages. 

This is an excellent time to buy in and the market has really over reacted from the negative results of one of their other trials for a different drug released earlier this year. Regardless, this sweet valuation is only going to make this fucker pop more when the FDA stamps a nice go-ahead on their drug. 

Yeah, so, I'm buying in. 

Disclamer: I'm really autistic so please do you own DD I'm not even sure if I'm looking at the right numbers.

If you’ve missed the 57 articles/day on YHOO’s valuation it basically translates to “Declining Core Assets and IP (4B – 8B) + BABA shares (32.5B) + YHOO JAPAN (8.6) + NET CASH (4.2B)” = 41.B conservatively (figuring 20% tax rate on BABA and YAHOY, and 4B for core assets.)  

At my most conservative – I see this at $43 in the next 4 weeks.  $42 on news of sale of core assets, with plenty of upside if the Core goes for more than $4B, or if BABA continues its moon-run (earnings 8/10).  

I’m in for 25K (15K on calls split between Aug 16 ITM and Sep 16 ITM.  I also have a few July 22nd calls in case the hypetrain leaves the station early, and another 10K in shares in case YHOO sells the whole kit and caboodle at the same time and there’s some sort of shareswap/ dividend bullshit.

The past few weeks I've been selling OTM verticals, on NUGT, an hour or two before close and expiration. It's was a quick an easy way to make a few hundred bucks. 

Because I'm an idiot, I thought if your option expired OTM, at 4pm eastern, your short option was essentially closed and you just collected the premium. As I watched NUGT head towards the moon at 4:30, on Friday, I figured I should look up after hours option risks. To my surprise, the contract buyer has until 5:30, to exercise the option. 

Woke up Saturday morning with a margin call and short $150k worth of NUGT... With all the garbage going on in Turkey, I had visions of NUGT taking off like it did for Brexit, up 30%  and me having a $40k+ loss. Luckily, that shit calmed down and I woke up this morning to some decent gains. 

TL:DR Buy back your short options before expiration, so you don't get fucked.

16-07-19,4tis12,"Dumb Question: Why don't mutual funds for shorts exist?","Conventional wisdom is that the problem with shorts is that potentially the stock will exponentially increase in value, which means that holding them long term requires tying up a lot of capital and is a terrible idea. However, in aggregate, the stock market does not rise very much each year. If all the individuals who wanted to do a long term short were able to pool their risk, the liquidity required to cover the aggregate risk would be a lot lower, since it's unlikely the entirety of the stock market will exponentially increase in value. So why do no mechanisms or services for pooling this risk currently exist? Why not have individuals pay money into a fund that does a large number of long term shorts, and thus be able to avoid imposing such strenuous liquidity requirements on people? I would think this service would be highly in demand.

I am probably missing something obvious here. Can anyone point at it for me?

It does make sense to me that to the extent inverse ETFs work well, they would be more popular than this. But my understanding is that they don't really work, and require a lot of cost consuming active management.

It also makes sense to me that it would be better to invest in a competitor directly than to bet against one specific company. But many many many situations exist which are not zero sum, in which there is no good way to approximate the long term shorting of a company. Situations where direct competitors exist seem rare.

From what I've been reading, this was basically the strategy pursued by Kynikos. But they did it on a very large scale. I'm curious why nothing more decentralized than them has come into existence?",0

Youre buying a legacy company doing fairly well from what I see at first glance, in a low cost-of-goods environment (oils cheap, tires are made from oil) so one could see an increased profit from lower oil prices in the future. Prices are still stabilizing though so its hard to read that.  
  
Tires are essential and Cooper is the 12th largest global tire manufacturer. Wrigleys/Buffett kinda feel to this, tires will be around for the next 100 years.

It might be a bit of a showerthought, but I just started contemplating energy ideas and thinking that smaller scale power, power not reliant on transmission, could see very strong growth in the mid-term in a lot of markets; especially emerging. Remote villages and developing countries that currently have little to no (reliable) power generation due to inability to build/lack of infrastructure to deliver it from large generation plants could move to buying packs like this to supply power. Rural areas in developed countries could find it cheaper to invest in more off-grid options to save on infrastructure maintenance. 

Almost in a sense of how cell phones became widespread, even in areas that did not previously have land-line service, when they became ubiquitous and inexpensive enough. I could potentially even see utilities leasing/servicing units like this over maintaining or repairing infrastructure like they do. How often are wind and ice storms knocking out power due to line failure that might be mitigated by smaller power generation units over large ones? The maintenance and labor costs to upkeep, replace, or expand these systems could be large savings to utilities, perhaps.

Even green initiatives like wind farms and solar arrays require distribution and proximity; what if smaller power units eliminated that? As prices of these generation options continue to fall, use continues to rise, and applications continue to expand, what companies could be at the forefront?

Anyway, maybe it's outlandish, but I figured I'd see if any of you might know of any companies that might focus or have a piece of any aspect of something like this. Sure, I know there are TSLA and GE size companies that are in this market, but what about smaller companies? How about deeper into the wormhole and companies that manufacture battery packs, switches, smaller turbines or arrays, control boards, cases, etc. that are utilized in these?",1

16-07-19,4tje98,"Why not to hold TASR, RGR, and SWHC until earnings","Since y'all like homoeroticism, here's some sexy TA on why you shouldn't keep holding these three stocks until earnings roll in.

Lets look at the 1-day charts, with a rainbow moving average overlay, for:

[TASR](http://connect.chartiq.com/IQSXLILGUU.png)

[RGR](http://connect.chartiq.com/IQSXM36CJJ.png)

[SWHC](http://connect.chartiq.com/IQSXMBGJ7X.png)

For those that don't know what you're looking at, [each vertical rectangle represents a stock's prices on a given day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlestick_chart). [The rainbow/ribbon moving average](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/movingaverageribbon.asp) is just a bunch of [moving averages](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/movingaverage.asp) that consider different \(in this case, rather small\) periods - red is the shortest period (2 days, in this case) purple is the longest period (20 day, I believe). [When the moving averages cross over,](http://www.onlinetradingconcepts.com/TechnicalAnalysis/MASimple2.html) there's a good reason to expect a new trend, or general direction in which the stock prices moves. Normally I wouldn't write this out, but I have almost infinite faith in the incompetence of this subreddit.

With that out of the way, what is the common trend here? There aren't any BIG jumps going on in the aftermath of domestic tragedies - at least not in the same way as we saw with [NVDA's most recent earning (circled in this chart)](http://connect.chartiq.com/IQSY3Y10K7.png). 

So not much of a yolo opportunity, unless you're placing calls/puts.

More importantly, you're not even seeing any noteworthy growth! Maybe a percent or two, that almost instantly gets wiped out by a percent or two in the opposite direction. As you can see, the moving averages are constantly crossing over one another, bouncing back and forth. This is indicative of a sideways trend - meaning, you're not going to see much growth or decline. 

For reference, take a look at the [NVDA chart](http://connect.chartiq.com/IQSY3Y10K7.png) again. Look at the area that's circled and the area that's right before July. See how nicely all the moving averages intersect one another and start to go up? That's how a trend reversal looks. There's none of that going on at the moment in TASR, RGR, or SWHC.

In my opinion, most heavy weight investors aren't buying into the hype anymore, when there's a shooting, and aren't buying up these stocks. Similarly, there hasn't been as much talk of body cams recently, [which comprise a large portion of Taser's business](http://www.axon.io/products/body), while their stun gun sales are casually chugging along, just as they always were, for the most part ([there's been some talk about possible abuse of stun guns this year](http://lawofficer.com/2016/03/new-ruling-places-officers-at-risk-for-lawsuit-using-taser/)). Technically speaking, no pun intended, this is more in line with fundamental analysis, but I think it's relevant, nonetheless.

So, to any *traders* who are holding, it's probably best to set up a stop loss right after the prices for any of these three goes up 1.5-2%, and dump most of your shares. If you're confident that there might be a spike or jump in the next week or two, keeping a couple of shares probably won't hurt. Then, I'd buy back in a few day to a week before earnings are announced. Similarly, you could work some plays around NICS numbers, whenever the newest batch gets released. As much as I hate to say it, I actually don't know when that will happen.

To anyone who owns shares of these companies and is trying to be an *investor*, got lost, and somehow ended up on this dumbass sub, keep holding your shares. You'll most likely make modest return until earnings come in. I'd recommend checking the next NICS report, and seeing if there's reason to believe that firearm sales went up or not. If the did, keep holding. If not, there's a chance that earnings may not bring about any particularly good gains.

Standard disclaimers: I'm not a pro. The above is like just my opinion, man. Take the above with a grain of salt. Don't rely on it when making trades and/or investments. Plz gfy.",5

16-07-19,4tn2xp,CHEW!! CHEW!! All aboard the AAPL train. Next stop: Dumpsterfire Depot,"Buy your puts now, gentlemen. Earnings are on the 26th, and the stock is near its highest point since its last earnings report, when the stock dropped more than 10% over the course of a few days based on lower than expected EPS, weak guidance, and on being the first time in a long while that AAPL didn't experience a higher growth % compared to the previous quarter.

So why buy puts now, a couple of weeks before earnings?

* What has AAPL put out since the last earnings? The iPhone SE
*[iPhone SE](http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/07/06/apple-incs-iphone-se-a-hit-or-miss-in-china.aspx) [not received as well](http://www.cnet.com/news/iphone-se-garners-3-4-million-preorders-in-china/) [as hoped in China](http://www.valuewalk.com/2016/07/apple-inc-aapl-china-june-q/)
* AAPL may well beat EPS, but what's important is guidance. AAPL is a growth company, and if it's not able to maintain its exponential growth, and if it doesn't reveal any solid plans to maintain said growth, you can be sure investors are going to flock elsewhere.
* [This fucking interview lol](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/02/tim-cook-the-most-important-thing-for-apple-long-term.html)
* Stock is nearing $100, where it has massive resistance. It's not likely to convincingly break this resistance leading up to earnings. Again, what has the company accomplished in the last quarter?
* Last time leading up to earnings, AAPL stock hit a multi-month high, and then started trending steadily downwards. This info, combined with the above, leads me to believe the stock may start trending downwards.
* Get your puts now before pre-earnings premium sends put prices through the roof... if you're confident the stock won't float above $100 leading up to earnings, that is.
* I just can't imagine what good news could come from the earnings report. What revelutionary plan will AAPL present for continuing its growth and expanding its client base? The only thing I can think of is announcing they will be acquiring some business or another, which would still send its share price down.

So get your AAPL puts now. If I'm wrong, I'll eat my dinner and post video proof.",4

16-07-20,4tpi4i,Is GSS gay?,"No. It's a fucking ticker. It has no sexual preference. But I'm drunk, so fuggit. It's TA time.

But first, lets do the super basic fundies.

GSS ([Golden Star Resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Star_Resources)) is a Canuck company that mines gold in Ghana. [Mining comprises 5% of Ghana's GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_industry_of_Ghana), which is 5% of [48.14 billion USD](https://www.google.com/search?q=ghana+gdp&amp;amp;amp;oq=ghana+gdp&amp;amp;amp;aqs=chrome.0.0l6.2919j0j4&amp;amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;amp;ie=UTF-8). So the value of mining in Ghana amounts to roughly $2,407,000,000 (USD). I can't really walk a straight line at the moment, let alone read a wiki article. But the wiki page for mining in Ghana covers six sectors. Let's, for the sake of simplicity, assume that they all have equal contribution to the nation's GDP. This means that gold in Ghana contributes 401,166,666.70 USD. I don't know squat about Ghana, but [a basic Google search indicates that there are a good number of juniors in the country](https://www.google.com/search?q=number+of+gold+miners+in+ghana&amp;amp;amp;oq=number+of+gold+miners+in+ghana&amp;amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0.6775j0j9&amp;amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;amp;ie=UTF-8). So let's divide that number by 20 - this should take into account all the miners in the country and add a factor of safety for any inflated numbers and/or corruption). We get a best case real-world value of 20,058,333.33 USD for GSS - I tend to be on the cynical side of things.

What is the market cap of GSS? According to Yahoo Finance, it's [280.69M](http://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GSS?ltr=1)

So, fundamentally speaking, I think the stock is kinda overpriced.

But who gives a shit?

&amp;amp;gt;something about personal solvency and market rationality, amiright?

[Let's take look at the 1-day candle stick chart with a moving avg. rainbow overlay (2 day-20 day SMA)](http://connect.chartiq.com/IQUDV3ZGV8.png).

Now, I'm drunk, so I might be totally wrong, but.... it looks like we're in a solid up trend! Like, holy shit! I don't know what happened on July 14 - maybe Nice? - but GSS shot the fuck up! Maybe a large fund decided to buy in right around noon, based on the volume spike, right around that time on 7/14?

Regardless, it appears that a mild sideways/down trend began around June 14, which gave way to a strong up trend in late June. This uptrend continued through early July. Mid July, there was a huge bump that carried a fuckload of momentum. Based on trading volume, this trend is very strong (the last strong uptrend happened in April and it had mostly lower volume).

My taken on GSS is hold that motherfucker, if you're a trader. It looks like this shit can very well keep climbing... But it technically is a penny stock and, [looking at the 1 min charts more closely](http://connect.chartiq.com/IQUEHJPOW4.png), the trade volume has been really low, excluding 7/14. Frankly, I think I'm going to drop $10-20 into this crap tomorrow, just for shits and gigs. If I had to predict right now, I'll probably hold for a week or two.

I'd do a resistance/support analysis for all you technical analysis believers, but I don't think that I could draw a horizontal line even if I used the horizontal line tool, right now.

If you're an investor, do better DD than what a drunk millennial can offer you on a Tuesday night.

16-07-19,4tnmxt,Trump Victory Play: Analysis of an Overlooked Catalyst,"Personally, I don't think Trump will win. But if he did, I think there's an interesting (and possibly overlooked) play on the following companies: 
AAPL, MSFT, GE, PFE, IBM

Consider the following 3 points: 

First, US companies hold over **1.4 Trillion Dollars** overseas from international sales. They do not repatriate it because the tax rate is higher than normal corporate profits. Apple alone has over $180 Billion dollars just sitting overseas and Tim Cook has said he will not bring it into the US because they'd lose around 40% of it right off the top. The 5 companies listed above are the largest *known* overseas cash bag holders. 

Second, take a look at [Donald Trump's Tax Plan](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/tax-reform). Regarding the funding of his tax cuts, he plans to implement: 

*A one-time deemed repatriation of corporate cash held overseas at a significantly discounted 10% tax rate, followed by an end to the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad.*

This is basically what these companies have been lobbying for. If this actually happened, Apple would be able to bring in that $180B and keep $160B+ of it. Those five companies would probably bring in close to half a trillion dollars. That's money they can use for acquisitions, R&amp;D, marketing, stock buybacks, top-shelf hookers, you name it ...

Just wanted some opinions/dd discussion.

Just to begin obviously the biggest factors are going to be all about user growth, vr breakthroughs and ad revenue.

Currently FB has 1.6 billion people using FB at least once/month and 1 billion on the mobile app. I don't recall if Instagram and Whatsapp are included but the shear ad revenue generated is fucking staggering.

After listening to the most recent shareholder meeting it seems that most people are concerned about International (Chinese) growth, VR, how Mark stays ""warm and fuzzy to potential investors"" and how long Mark is planning on staying at FB (he says a long time.)

Thoughts?

Aug 26 125 C lookin mighty tasty right now.

Edit: I also forgot to mention that after listening to the June 2016 shareholder meeting, Mark mentioned that the VP was visiting China. Obviously this is the next frontier for facebook, imagine during earnings what will happen if Facebook announces it has been granted access in China. Not saying its 100% but it could be a big catalyst.

16-07-19,4tnssl,stockAday: Tick-tock Teva! Should you wait? $TEVA,"# Key Stats for Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR)

Teva's a king in the generic drugs business. i.e. they wait until drug patents expire and they then produce low cost versions. They help get those drugs to a massive audience who otherwise weren't able to afford the high cost on-patent drugs. Nice!

Though the big one to watch with Teva is probably the closing of their mega deal to buy Actavis Generics, from Allergan. Was supposed to close in March, then June...

# Description
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited is a global pharmaceutical company. The Company is engaged in developing, producing and marketing generic medicines and a portfolio of specialty medicines. 

## Recent financials 

It's been an uneventful few years at the top line. Though earnings have been less than exciting :(

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $19.7bn | $20.3bn | $20.3bn | $20.3bn | $18.3bn|
|EPS | $1.82 | $3.56 | $1.49 | $2.25 | $3.09|

## Competition

From their SEC filing:

&gt; We are subject to intense competition in the generic drug market from domestic and international generic drug manufacturers, brand-name pharmaceutical companies through lifecycle management initiatives, authorized generics, existing brand equivalents and manufacturers of therapeutically similar drugs. Price competition from additional generic versions of the same product typically results in margin pressures. We believe that our primary competitive advantages are our ability to continually introduce new and complex generic equivalents for brand-name drug products on a timely basis, our quality, our customer service and the breadth of our product portfolio. 

It seems that the cost of manufacturing generics continues to decline. Therefore distribution will be increasingly important. I can only imagine a scale player like TEVA has an advantage.

It's margins are pretty good versus the pure-play competitors though returns aren't that impressive.

|Generics Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR) | $19,480M | 31% | 6%
Allergan plc | $16,304M | 27% | -ve
Mylan NV | $9,749M | 31% | 8%
Dr.Reddy's Laboratories Ltd (ADR) | $2,305M | 27% | 17%
Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc | C$13,521M | 46% | -ve

Surprisingly, if we look at the 3 pharma majors with big generic businesses, the margins compare nicely. 

|Mainstream|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Novartis AG (ADR) | $49,995M | 31% | 9%
Pfizer Inc. | $50,992M | 38% | 12%
Sanofi SA (ADR) | $38,271M | 31% | N/A

So maybe copying is just as good as inventing? ;)

## Cash / Debt?

Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR) has $4,236M of net debt. That is 0.7x it's latest operating profit. Not a lot to get worries about there. But after the Actavis deal the situation is going to be markedly different. With FCF going to pay off debts in 2017,2018,2019 they think they'll get back to 1.1x debt by end of 2019.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $69.43 for Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR) and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 28% to their target.

# Valuation

And at 10x forecast earnings, I can see why Wall Street has a sweet spot for $TEVA. It doesn't take a lot of positive sentiment to push that, especially if it earnings surprise.

However, one thing that looks odd is the low FCF yield. How does a 10% earnings yield become a 5% FCF yield and only a 2% dividend yield? 

Aside: Valeant's figures look like Wall Street's forgotten to update them!

[Generics Companies](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/teva.k/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
TEVA.K | $49,810M | 10x | 5% | 2% | 5%
AGN | $96,686M | 17x | 10% | 0% | 4%
MYL.O | $23,146M | 9x | 14% | 0% | 8%
RDY | $9,064M | 26x | 9% | 1% | 5%
VRX.TO | C$10,372M | 3x | 20% | 0% | 7%

And in contrast the mainstream pharma boys have higher PEs but seem to convert to both cashflow and dividends a lot better. Anyone have a view why?

Mainstream|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
NVS | $215,182M | 17x | 6% | 3% | 9%
PFE | $222,216M | 15x | 8% | 3% | 9%
SNY | $106,756M | 14x | 5% | 4% | 12%

# Dividends
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR) is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.29 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $1.36 per share. That is a -5% growth. The forecast dividend of $1.29 compares to a forecast EPS of $5.31.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -5% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -4%. So no real surprise there. 

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/teva/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers. On the latest call they gave a view on the 2016 to 2019 period, which is pretty rare for a US listed company to do. 
&gt; EPS between 6.9 to 7.4 in 2019 

Versus $5.31 for 2016, that's a pretty nice boost.

Though in terms of catalysts
* I can't help believe that the market doesn't like the uncertainty on when the deal closes. It's a massive purchase (circa $35 to 40bn price tag, when their own market value is just $50bn).
* Plus allergan will end up with 100m shares, just under 10% stake and it's hard not to see them dumping those shares, when their lock-up agreement ends
* Also the major jump in earnings is synergies related. So proof they can squeeze out the synergies faster is likely to be well received.

Now I'm leaving ABC.  They are going to want 50% of their contributions back (5 shares of ABC).   Since I no longer own any ABC...

* Do they take some of my shares of XYZ that would equal 50% of their contributions in dollar value?  Or...
* Do they sell some of my XYZ, convert it to ABC, then take that?  Or...

16-07-20,4tt3b2,"I just faded NUGT and jumped on DUST - here's why.","What made gold miners take such a huge hit today?  A lot of gold miners have earnings come out in 2 weeks.  Equities are doing well and it could just be some profit taking.  However, the main catalyst causing the downturn, in my opinion, was this WSJ article released at 7/19 8:36PM.


http://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-officials-gain-confidence-they-can-raise-rates-this-year-1468922401


The next fed meeting minutes will be released on the 27th and this article basically states that a rate hike in September is very much on the table due to better than expected economic data.  This is corroborated by the CME fedwatch tool.  Take a look at the change in the September contracts: 
http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html

The chance of rates increasing to 50-75 in September changed from 18.2% to 24% overnight. 

I think more and more articles providing this fed viewpoint will basically leak out and gold will continue to drop.  I don't think its an accident WSJ released this article after hours.  So if you buy the premise that the Fed will likely raise rates in September and will confirm this info on 7/27 then gold will continue to drop.  All the gold miners, especially NUGT, which have advanced incredibly fast based on continued rate cutting climate will also drop, just as fast if not faster, thus LONG DUST!

16-07-20,4tqy2u,A little help understanding dividends,"I've been doing a bit of reading on dividends and how they work and I'm a bit confused.  I'm hoping someone can help clear up what I'm missing.

My first concept of dividends was essentially ""great, the company is giving me free money.""  However, upon doing further research I discovered that the share price drops by the amount of the dividend when dividends are issued.   This makes sense to me, since the value of the dividend is no longer on the company books.

This, then, appears to be a zero-sum game: my share price is decreased by the amount of the dividend (thus lowering the total value of the existing shares), but, if I reinvest the dividends, my total account value is increased by the amount of the dividend.  So nothing has changed?  Except, of course, that dividends are a taxable event that cost me money.

Given this, can someone help me understand why dividends exist?  I'm sure I'm missing something critical in my understanding.  It just seems like the zero-sum nature of the game coupled with the taxes would be seen as a net negative, yet they are not. 

Thanks for the help! :)",13

tl;dr there's still upside to this bear rally on DUST/JDST, probably ~15% after a brief pullback for the next couple of days.

why? lots of rumors about a rate hike, lately. FOMC is 7/26-27. a strong dollar kills gold, and rumors of a fed rate hike will completely fuck up miner guidance this earnings season, making their earnings beats pointless. 

the NUGT/JNUG DUST/JDST funds have apparently only gone through one rate hike, ever. an actual rate hike, especially in a hot domestic american economy, would wreck gold. a lot of old fuckers who believed the snake oil salesmen are going to have to move to shittier nursing homes. 

what's even worse for gold is this unprecedented economic indicator for these ETFs: american wage growth is knocking it out of the park, for the first time in nearly a decade. keep in mind, stagnant wages were one of the last indicators that we were still shaking off the shitstorm of 2008. the american consumer is the biggest driver of the american economy, and he just got paid.

the existing home sales data + the jobless claims + chicago fed reports coming out tomorrow will also have a major impact. 

if these reports look good, then holding DUST/JDST is a very sweet deal for a couple weeks, up to a month if you're full degen. the bear miner funds could rocket until at least mid-august in a way we haven't seen since oct 2014 (~100%) or july 2015 (~62%, or ~110% on a very lucky 1-day spike that closed down HARD).

it's not a good idea to get into these funds right when rate hikes are implemented; most of the time the market prices in hikes well before then. as always, buy the rumor. JDST actually lost money in december 2015, w/ the last rate hike that everyone had anticipated all year.

also important to keep in mind, the highest 1-mo return on JDST is about 80%, but holding it for longer than a month is nearly always suicide. you can lose 69% in a single month on JDST, in fact this just happened in february. april was even worse, where we saw a 71.2% drop. 

as the autist ETF of choice, this fund has lost over 98% in the last 52 weeks. don't fuck around with it long-term.

when to buy, then? JDST has gained 5 straight days. the last time it did that was in January. personally, i'd hold off and let it sort itself out for a day or two. if it hits $6.80, that's a good starting point. ",15

But the main thing im confused about is the taxes between the two. Which one is easier to do for taxes at the end of the year. 

I'm also a bit confused from how some people say there's no tax difference between etf and mutual funds if you're going to be buying Vanguard etf/fund.

16-07-20,4tre8k,Beginner Stock Trader Who needs Advice.,"So about 3-4 days ago, I had realized it would have been an excellent idea to invest in NTDOY because of the Pokemon release, however due to restrictions on my Scottrade account, i was having to wait 3 days to not only verify my bank account, But also they put a 3 day wait on your funds that you had just added. So in the midst of this time, alot has happened, and now that i've had to wait so long, i have slowly lost interest and feel that i've missed my shot to invest in Nintendo. But in this time, i have spent days reading what people say stocks are ""Gold Mines"", although i will never buy a stock someone says is great until i determine its great myself, i have some ideas of what i may be interested in investing in. 

Since i'm a beginner, Im just starting out with $500 to play around with. So shares that are $500+ i'm Not interested in..

I'm Currently debating NVDA, GE, EA, TSLA, AMD. Have considered half and half in 2 stocks, have considered all evenly distributed. I Guess at my current stage id like to define myself as a swing trader, ill most likely want a return in about a week or 2. Until i really get everything figured out, i don't think ill do any long term investing. I chose these companies because i generally know the market well, and their Charts are beautiful. I have watched some videos on Resistance and Support, and how all of that works, and i feel that these stocks have potential. Although id like some advice before i do anything.",1

I lost nearly $300 in NFLX, but let this be a great reminder to us about the psychology of a Wall Street Better.

# Description
Seagate Technology is a provider of electronic data storage products, i.e. hard disk drives.

## Recent financials 

Now financials haven't been growing for a couple of years, but if you look at earnings the scenarios has much nicer, though looking at the share count, it's been driven by a pretty good buyback in train. Roll forward to 2016... and the party train's stopped, with EPS forecast for this year of $2.07. :(

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $13.7bn | $13.7bn | $14.4bn | $14.9bn | $11.0bn|
|EPS | $5.26 | $4.52 | $4.81 | $6.49 | $1.09|
|No. of shares | 331m | 347m | 382m | 441m | 467m|

## Competition

Talking about the competition they say:

&gt; We compete primarily with manufacturers of hard drives used in the enterprise, client compute and client non-compute applications, in addition to manufacturers of solid-state drives and PCIe accelerator cards. Disk drive manufacturers compete for a limited number of major disk drive customers but also compete with other companies in the electronic data storage industry that provide SSDs and PCIe technology. 

&gt; There are three companies in the electronic data storage industry that manufacture disk drives: Seagate; Western Digital, and; Toshiba Corporation

So it's a pretty concentrated industry. That should be good for margins and returns?
Even so, Seagate's margins are worse than $WDC's though better than the conglomerates: Toshiba and HD.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Seagate Technology PLC | $11,434M | 13% | 13%
Western Digital Corp | $12,690M | 18% | 9%
HP Inc | $61,449M | 11% | 33%
Toshiba Corp (USA) | $53,423M | -ve | -ve

## Cash / Debt?
Seagate Technology PLC has $2,931M of net debt. That is 2x it's latest operating profit. Probably nothing to worry about there, as it seems they are busy paying dividends and buying back shares, returning cash to shareholders as best they can. These activities can be adjusted to make sure the balance sheet is reasonable.

&gt;   On July 24, 2013, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase $2.5 billion of its outstanding ordinary shares. On April 22, 2015 the Board of Directors authorized the company to repurchase an additional $2.5 billion of its outstanding ordinary shares. As of July 3, 2015, $2.9 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limits. There is no expiration date on these authorizations.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $27.19 for Seagate Technology PLC and their recommendation to clients is _Hold_. That implies an downside of 9% to their target.

# Valuation

FCF yield looks wonderful for this industry, even if the PE ratios aren't cheap, and Seagate's offering a remarkable dividend. Though the growth forecasts are worrisome. Is this really a business that is going in reverse? That the impact of the _cloud_?

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/stx.o/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
STX.O | $8,952M | 14x | -11% | 8% | 20%
WDC.O | $11,929M | 10x | -1% | 4% | 19%
HPQ | $24,034M | 9x | 1% | 4% | 28%
TOSYY.PK | $11,956M | 11x | 7% | 0% | -ve

# Dividends
Seagate Technology PLC is forecast to pay a dividend of $2.36 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $2.34 per share. That is a 1% growth. 

The forecast dividend of $2.36 compares to a forecast EPS of $2.07. Now, I am rarely a fan of a business that has a DPS  &gt; EPS. It's a warning signal. Any cut in the DPS would be a negative signal even though the yield is high at 8%.


# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 17% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -12%. That's against a backdrop of sales for the 39 weeks ended 01 April 2016, down 21% to $8.51B.

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/stx/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers. On that call they made a worrisome comment about 2017. Thinking about their buyback...

&gt; I think in terms of buy backs whether it's debt or equity, for the near term we will probably not reduce the cash or probably if there is excess cash we would keep it on the balance sheet, just in case the macro situation turns on us as we had more confidence about 2017 outlook.

It seems that sentiment is against them, and they are worrying people with their outlook. The secular negative is that their cash-cow, hard-disk-drives is in trouble. Perhaps the doomsday view is just that?

Even so, maybe I'll sit until after a dividend cut? If one comes at all.

16-07-20,4tu3cr,GPRO What to do with it.,"Ok, so I purchased 100 shares of Go Pro when the IPO initially hit the market.  The goal was to purchase enough to cover my initial investment and sell half.  Once the stock doubled in price, I sold half of it, essentially covering my initial investment.  I still have 50 shares, but the price for my remaining shares is now below my initial purchase price (by about 60%).  So my question is two fold

A) Does this stock have ANY real hope of bouncing back and becoming worth the holding onto or.

B) Do I sell the remaining shares (I will profit from it only because I have already covered my initial investment with the first sale) and move on.  If I do this, when is the most financially intelligent time to do so?  From my understanding selling stocks at a loss at certain times in the fiscal year can affect your tax rates/write offs.

16-07-20,4ts2a6,Ben Graham and the Intelligent Investor. Overrated?,"I'm reading The Intelligent Investor by Ben Graham, and I'm kind of disappointed. The first half of the book is mostly just stock market psychology. The difference between investing and speculating, Mr. Market, and various such vague aphorisms. It's not that I don't agree with the general sentiment, it's that it's so well known and somewhat obvious. Stay rational! You must do your due diligence! Kind of John Madden-esque: ""Well you know if you get the ball in the end zone, that's a touchdown."" (**Madden Voice**)

You could say that the proper psychology is ""necessary but not sufficient"" for successful investing. But guys like David Einhorn are successful because of their intensive fundamental analysis, and I was hoping to see more of that in the book.

In the second half of the book, he does get into some individual security analysis, but it's mostly just surface level financial ratios type of stuff. For example: take the 30 stocks in the DJIA, and subject them to a screen for P/B, Current Ratio, long history of dividends etc. and you're left with 12 companies. Buy those 12 companies. 

This is a more purely quantitative style of investing, and I'm not sure if I believe that it's useful nowadays. Surely, some guys like Cliff Asness are successful with similar strategies, but it seems like for guys coming into the business it'd be easier to make your edge by reading lots of 10-ks and industry reports, and really just getting to know a company and it's key drivers, and eventually after 100s of hours, getting a usable insight. Anyone can apply a stock screen, but not everyone is willing to devote 100s of hours to analyzing a single company/industry.

16-07-20,4ts3h8,Div announced today JNJ ??,"In the past I have found the following site quite reliable:
  
http://www.marketbeat.com/dividends/latest/  
  
Today that page includes a JNJ div announcement that makes no sense.  Is that just an error?  Or is something strange going on that I don't understand?  Or does that line that looks like it says JNJ really say something else (some other class of stock maybe)?  
  
Edit:  Now a google search finds many news stories from online news organizations (that I never heard of) containing the same announcement.  But even though the news organization names and URLs are all different, all the page layout and formatting details are the same across all those pages.  So I assume all those news sites are fake.  I hope using Centos Linux makes me safe from whatever malware is installed by visiting those fake news sites (Centos is pretty hard for third party software to install into, even when you want to.  If it isn't open source recompiled by the Centos team, you'll have trouble installing it).  
  
But the original site on which I saw the announcement is legit.  What's the story?  
  
Edit2: I never meant to imply there was any connection (conspiracy) between the strange info about JNJ (which I now understand was pure error) and the bogus news sites that were found by my google search.  I don't think bogus news sites **selectively** repeat incorrect info.  I assume they copy info from other sites without caring whether it is right or wrong.  And now that I know the original info was an error, I assume the google search didn't find legit sites because most legit sites didn't copy that error (except for the one legit site where I originally found it).

Honestly, I'm just looking for a discussion.  Also I'm new to WSB, trade on RH, and only have around $3k to play with, so by all means tell me to GFM.

General Information Via [NASDAQ](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/ttwo):

Current:            $40.52
52 Wk Low	        $25.01

Avg. Volume	1,356,421
Market Cap	3.39 B
Dividend	        0.00 ( 0.00%)
Exp Earnings Date - 8/4/16  *AMC
Current Qtr Est	-0.49

So, I can't make heads or tails of what to do with this stock right now. I originally jumped in at $40.78 earlier this month, wondering if there was a possibility for some gains to still be made here (along with wanting to diversify beyond just ATVI/NVDA/AMD at the time).

TTWO's E3 line-up was, to put it kindly, uninspired.  Despite a lot of hype and potential build-up, the two biggest titles shown were *Mafia 3* and *Civilization VI*.  *Battleborn* is very likely under-performing, especially given an immediate transition to allow micro-transaction purchases within the game, and *Overwatch* just being hyped as fuck. (Here's hoping for some sweet ATVI quarterly reports!)

*NBA 2K17*, *WWE 2K17*, and *Civ* will probably be financially successful, but it seems the market isn't buying into any pre-release hype at all.  *Civ's* stock-bump seems to have long-since settled, and I find it unlikely that *XCOM 2's* Shen's Last Gift DLC is selling anywhere near enough to garner any movement from a stock perspective.

However, *despite all that*, what has my interest piqued is the potential for a *Red Dead Redemption* sequel announcement.  [Former employees](http://www.psu.com/news/28777/Rockstar-working-on-Red-Dead-Redemption-2-says-former-employee) have bluntly stated they were working on the project in the past, and many seem to feel that a trailer or announcement was pulled from E3 in the wake of the Orlando shooting. (Sony has denied this.) It's rumored that assets for the new game have leaked online as well.

Personally, I feel RDR2 could help TTWO continue to grow in the coming months.  The question I'm asking myself is, how long will it take for us to get anything concrete on the game, and do I feel it's *potential* sales would result in the stock growing enough to warrant holding it during that in-between period, especially with a possible negative sales report coming on 8/4/16?

So, what do you guys think?  Buy/Hold/Sell/GFY?

16-07-20,4ts59a,Earnings Play Currently Not Being Discussed.,"Just thought I would share a play I am involved in that some of you may not be looking at. That is LUV. While I usually stay away from airlines, I see an opportunity here. I am just going to lay out a bunch of info and you can read up as much or little as you wish.

Some close competitors of LUV : AAL,DAL,SAVE,UAL,ALK,HA,JBLU.

As you may know, DAL and UAL recently beat earnings. Lets see how LUV stacks up compared to them. 
What pops out to me LUV has a better short float, better sales Q/Q, better debt and LTdebt/eq. Slightly higher PE and forward PE though. 

Another factor at play is competetors who happen to release earnings on the same day. LUV releases tomorrow BMO. So does ALK. LUV is projected to have better PE growth, better EPS this Y, next year, better sales Q/Q, and a much better float short. 

I think LUV has a good chance at solid 2-3% gains. Sorry for the messy format, but just wanted to share so you can maybe go research for yourself and make a play. These same industry comparisons and way of thinking has worked 3/3 for me with BAC, SAP, and ABB.

So what is the website about? Basically, it solved a problem I had. We all see articles like ""Sentiment this negative has translated to higher stock prices"" or ""Earnings are on the decline, sell stocks"". My problem was that these articles quoted statistics in isolation. Sure, negative sentiment in the past might have indicated a turning point for stocks. But what were macro indicators doing back then? Or what was happening with the yield curve? I wanted the context of a multitude of different indicators, not just a sole data point, to make my investing decisions. Simple Stock Model provides that context.

There are four different categories of indicators on the site: Technicals, Sentiment, Rates, and Macro. Each category includes a number of different indicators. Each indicator has a simple filter rule to determine whether you should have exposure to the S&amp;P or not. For example, one macro indicator is the annual change in industrial production. That section of the site shows what would have happened if you would have historically only been invested in the S&amp;P when IP is positive over the past year.
Finally, there's the composite model that takes into account all 18 indicators to give you a comprehensive short-term overview of the market.

Check it out and let me know what you think!

A little new to investing, and been doing some research before plumping any money down. I've also been looking up how to short NTDOY, as I don't think the valuation of the stock given it's current price is sustainable nor correct.

Now, there was another thread a couple of days ago asking the same question, but the thread devolved into people criticizing whether or not the OP should short or not. That is not my goal.

My goal is to ask, is there a way on a common brokerage in the US (i.e. E Trade, TDA, Schwab, etc) to short NTDOY? I heard from people that they ""won't let you"". Is this correct?

His broker sends the order to exchange A which can only fulfill 2000 shares then the rest of the order is ""forwarded"" to exchange B to get the rest. However, HFTs saw that the trader wants 10k shares so they rushed to exchange B, purchased the stock and sold it to him at a higher price. That's front running. Now my question is.. how do they know he needs 10k shares? When HFT pay exchanges for info do they actually get the full info as in ""Trader A wants 10k shares, we gave him 2k and he needs 8k more"" ? or is there another way?

16-07-21,4ty3q4,Amazon enters student loan business in partnership with Wells Fargo,"Sources:

http://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-tip-toes-into-banking-business-1469093403

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-wells-fargo-student-loans-idUSKCN10125S

WFC and Amazon entered into this partnership today -- ""Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. bank by market value and the second-largest private student lender by origination volume, will shave a half a percentage point off the interest rate on student loans it extends to applicants who are members of Amazon’s Prime Student.""

""Wells Fargo had $12.2 billion in student loans outstanding at the end of 2015, compared with $11.9 billion at the end of 2014. One of the largest private lenders, the bank sold substantially all of its government guaranteed student loan portfolio in 2014.""

As a huge fan of WFC, I am worried by their pursuit of the student loan market. I don't know how competitive they can remain with the rise of smaller innovative business models like SoFi. Moreoever, I'm also worried that the bank sold substantially all of its government guaranteed student loan portfolio -- I think this was a risky move granted student loan repayment is so dependent on the economy, and that millennials, as as a group, aren't doing too well.

In regard to the actual partnership with Amazon - I think it will largely be a wash. I don't think it will have much of a dent on bringing in new customers. As a former student loan borrower myself, half a percentage point in interest was not enough incentive for me to make any significant decisions on choosing lender, if other terms  (like deferral) were not the most favorable. Still, its nice to see my favorite bank partnering with amazon.

16-07-21,4ty4j6,PENTAD Timing Model,"I've searched the sub for any references, but can't find any, so I figured I'd make a post.

Has anyone used the PENTAD Timing Model for a long period of time, if so how and where are you acquring your market information and what success have you had?

Background:
A family friend who has been retired/trading to maintain retirement for the past 20 years similar to my family member has been trading a decent chunk of his portfolio following the PENTAD timing system with decent success. It outperforms the S&amp;P by roughly 1% on a 15 and 30 year time frame, but depending on start or end points can have much larger alpha based almost entirely on avoiding losses.

It was designed by Nelson Freeburg and discussed in his book:
(https://www.amazon.com/Timing-Models-Proven-Indicators-Markets/dp/1592802281)

For a passive investor (e.g. SPY, buy and hold or buy/sell at major moves) it doesn't seem to require too much work (simple buy/sell/hold signals at end of week), and doesn't really have large trading costs as it generally doesn't flip from buy to sell rapidly. It bases the buy/hold/sell signals based on 5 different indexes (S&amp;P, DJ Utilities, DJ Transport, weekly adv/dec line, dow jones 20 bonds) and specific weekly MA tied to each index. Based on my limited knowledge it provides a buy signal when all 5 indexes are above their MA, and sell when 2 fall below. 


Any thoughts, experience, insight would be appreciated.

Positives
It is one of the very few companies in the industry that has a positive net cash position, 3.6% of net sales goes into R&amp;D which isn't too bad, growth isn't too aggressive or slow, the rest of the positives are included in the picture

Negatives
There has been an earnings deficit within the past 10 years and it doesn't pay a dividend. Its also not trading near the grahams enterprising stock number but is trading under the book value.

16-07-21,4tyko1,Timing the Market with Index Funds,"Now I know Jack Boggle doesn't want us to buy and sell in short term periods but rather he wants us to hold for the long term. Of course this makes sense but I do see potential in making even more in gains if you take advantage of short periods of volatility such as Brexit. I made a good decision during Brexit's low period to buy a lot of VTSAX with the ""speculation"" it would rise in the future, which it has. However, one thing I really wish I could have done was to sell as soon as I heard Brexit was being voted and then to buy about a week or so later so that I could be buying my stocks at a cheaper price while holding onto the regular gains my money would get over time. Unfortunately though, Vanguard doesn't allow the buying and selling of stocks within less than a month's period so, I couldn't sell but only 

I know I know I know, this is market timing and I shouldn't be worried about short term gains and loses, which I am not. However, I feel periods like Brexit are moments of opportunity. Warren Buffet says that when people are fearful you should be gready and to be fearful when people are gready. I'm a regular Joe who doesn't want to get hit by actively managed stock fees when trying to time the market so I was wondering if there way a way to time the market with index funds. 
If you do want to time the market with index funds, perhaps you can sell shares of one particular stock and buy another when you think the market is down. This way you can avoid the one month delay as the delay is associated with the stock type. Example, you buy VTSAX and sit on it till market volatility and when you predict the market will fall you sell before the fall actually happens. If the market does fall then you buy VLCAX which is a different stock type. You wait approximately one month after you've sold the VTSAX to transfer the money from your VTLAX into the VTSAX (putting a hold on your VTLAX for one month).

This is just my thoughts on how I would time the market if another Brexit type event were to happen. What are your thoughts? I know I'm speculating when to buy again  is tough but I think for moments like brexit you can avoid obvious losses and turn them into more of pure gains. Of course, simply holding would reveal a 8% return after inflation but I personally want to ""gamble"" on timing the market than gambling my money in vegas. A few % increase of decrease from that 8% return sounds like a good deal of fun for me.",11

 This was probably one of the only stocks I have ever publicly talked about, as I felt like not only the market deserved to be shared, but also the stock may have needed help too (don't know how much it did).


I also really appreciate the nice comments from my other RLYP posts, here are just a few.

[Post3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/4akbpb/rlyp_march_15th_script_data/)

So first off...CONGRATULATIONS to anyone who was involved in $RLYP, small, large, whatever it was we all made a profit...I hope. A lot of people have been asking what's next, what to invest in now and asking advice, however I am still going to remain stuck exactly where I am. I do have some companies in mind, but there is plenty of time to spare. 


Now, back to $RLYP. Currently as of this morning I bought another 400 shares at the current price. Why? Worst case scenario, I get back about 10c for evert share there, so $40, whatever. However, after quite a large amount of frustration last night at the buyout price, I was considering why the offer was taken. The company that offered $RLYP is small...this is about 20% of their market cap, big investment. I believe they thought they could offer a little more, and get a steal. 


What now? I am holding my shares, about 4200, until the $$ come in from the purchase. Will not hurt me to do that at all. However, I believe that JO has taken a gamble here, in the hopes that this buyout decision may have totally reversed the pressure on the big pharmas. The short position was huge, that is essentially gone now. Big pharma now has a time frame called the 'Go Shop Period', where $RLYP is allowed to shop for another round of offers, as it is in their duty to find the best possible price for the stock, law binding in-fact. What I believe this has done, is it is forcing a decision from these other potential bidders. AZN interests me, as they may have spent $2.7B for 0% of a market, so there is potentially a higher bid there. The market for this drug is perceived at $3B a year...potentially much bigger. It doesn't make sense to sell this for half the yearly TO. 


I will add to this later, as I am frazzled thinking about all of the possibilities. Please excuse the messy writeup, just wanted to get something out.

UPDATE 1: Remember the Go Shop Period lasts about 1-2 months, and in the press release, they are giving a three month window for the deal to be finalized. Look to AZN conference call next week to see if there is a fightback. Could be smart timing by Orwin.

UPDATE 2: From what I am understanding **AZN shorted RLYP**. This is very interesting, as they may now become a bidder to try and not only save losses, but also to gain control of the market. Interesting couple of months to come. 

I also made a twitter account @TheCrownedPixel. Would love to help share my advice if you all do find it valuable. ",67

16-07-22,4u1fm1,"$CRBP, watch for it, I am not saying buy it.","I know, another Biotech company. I am not happy about it either. 

I have been followed CRBP alongside RLYP for the past 6 months. 

**-------What is it-------**

CRBP's drug is called Resunab, it is aiming to treat four different patient groups, namely:

- Cystic Fibrosis - 30,000 (10million carry the gene, but do not have the disease).
- Systemic Sclerosis - 75,000 to 100,000
- Dermatomyositis - could not find
- Systemic Lupus Erythematosus - 1.5 million

**All of these numbers represent the US numbers only**

All of which get harder to say as you go down. As of right now the drug is deep in Phase 2 study, which I have heard should be ending in Q4, October time. **The drug has also been fast tracked by the FDA.**

The drug is meant to be administered daily, similar to a heart pill, or hypertension drug. 

**-------Potential Upside-------**

Trying to evaluate a pre Phase 3 drug is hard, as so many things could still drastically change. What interests me right now is the fact that there are NO OTHER DRUGS in the market that provide a solution to any of these problems (please correct me if I am wrong). This, to me, automatically determines total market dominance, as these conditions are not pleasant to deal with. 

The biggest question for me right now is how much will this drug cost. I tried evaluating it next to a heart failure drug, but they are a dime a dozen now, so very cheap. If we were to look at a months supply costing the same as RLYP:

10% market penetration: 160,000
Cost of drug: $600
12 month per year refill: 12

160,000*600*12 = $1.152B. 

CRBP is currently valued at $128Million. 

This would give up just over a 10x upside assuming a buyout for that amount. Now, my numbers are **PROBABLY** wildly off. I tried to counter this with the low market penetration. 

**-------Future-------**

I am interested in this stock, as it presents a possibility, as with all stocks. However:

&gt;Resunab™ has been well tolerated in a number of toxicity studies in mice, rats, and dogs with assessments of the central nervous system, cardiovascular and respiratory systems, renal system, and gastrointestinal system showing no adverse effects. In addition, 13-week toxicology studies have been completed in rats and dogs and showed no major toxicological concerns and an excellent safety margin based on drug exposure levels.

This says a little more to me than maybe it should. The fact that there were no damaging affects on such smaller animals is promising, Phase 1 trials can be vastly different for animals, but toxicity is usually a problem. Now we are waiting to see if the drug is actually useful for solving a problem. 

As of right now, I do not believe there is any need to act, and I am not endorsing to buy or mess with that ticker. I think this will be an interesting drug to watch, and then make a decision towards the end of September.

PETS will generally beat/flat because of millenial new pet owners during spring/ early summer, CEO got a pay increase recently, signal of good results. They are generally quiet, which skews analysts. I think it may beat by .01-.02 eps. Maybe a buy with a little of your portfolio, not yacht gains or anything like that.

# Description
Hasbro, Inc. (Hasbro) is a branded-play company. The Company offers entertainment offerings, including television programming and motion pictures, and products, ranging from traditional to digital, all informed by storytelling and consumer insights.

## Recent financials 

Sales have stagnated, But the company's managed to eek higher earnings in the last few years.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $4.4bn | $4.3bn | $4.1bn | $4.1bn | $4.3bn|
|EPS | $3.57 | $3.20 | $2.17 | $2.55 | $2.82|

## Competition

&gt; We are a worldwide leader in the design, manufacture and marketing of toys and games and other family entertainment offerings. We compete with several large toy and game companies in our product categories, as well as many smaller United States and international toy and game designers, manufacturers and marketers. 
&gt; We also compete with other companies that offer branded entertainment specific to children and their families. In entertainment, Hasbro Studios and Discovery Family Channel compete with other children’s and family television networks and entertainment producers, such as Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network and Disney Channel, for viewers, advertising revenue and distribution.

Of course there is the hideous reality that kids are increasingly more digital, and entertainment is coming in the form of apps and social networks too. So Apple and Facebook are competitors too. At least for a child's attention.

Defining competitors is a little tough. There's really only Mattel left in the pure sense. Then the games companies are probably a source of competition for a parent's wallet. And finally, Viacom and Disney are the beasts in the room, trying to bearhug the kids market.

So margins aren't as stellar as the other peers, nor are returns, but this is still a pretty nice business to be in. 

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Hasbro, Inc. | $4,646M | 19% | 32%
Mattel, Inc. | $5,649M | 14% | 14%
Activision Blizzard, Inc. | $4,841M | 35% | 11%
Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. | $1,414M | 9% | -ve
Electronic Arts Inc. | $4,396M | 25% | 36%
Walt Disney Co | $54,826M | 30% | 20%
Viacom, Inc. | $13,001M | 29% | 72%

## Cash / Debt?
Hasbro, Inc. has $629M of net debt. That is 0.7x it's latest operating profit. Management has the right to repurchase stock, but we can see they've not been aggressive. 

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $88.00 for Hasbro, Inc. and their recommendation to clients is _Hold_. That implies an upside of just 8% to their target. At 20x earnings, it seems fair.

# Valuation

Bizarrely, Wall Street still rates the growth prospects of $HAS and $MAT highly. Though I can't see how they justify it. That aside, the company does have a reasonable free-cash flow yield and they are returning cash to shareholders.

Of course the outlier is Viacom, though that's a whole post in itself!

VIAB.O | $17,936M | 10x | 5% | 4% | 18%

# Dividends
Hasbro, Inc. is forecast to pay a dividend of $2.00 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $1.94 per share. That is a 3% growth. The forecast dividend of $2.00 compares to a forecast EPS of $4.05. So everything seems reasonable there.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -6% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 1%. That's against of background of revenues up 13% in the last quarter. On a 6 month view the stock is up 15% driven by earnings upgraded 18%.

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/has/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers. They said:

&gt; Looking ahead, we have positive momentum and a powerful line of brands and play experiences for the remainder of 2016 and clear line of sight to growth in future years. 

Now that's a nice rally call but it's light on details. :( 

Perhaps the toys market isn't a hit-driven business, that it's hard to see any mega catalyst? Sure the economy and disposable income is key, but from a company driven basis, a toy franchise once established looks like it can live for years. $HAS have bought a couple of digital assets over the years. Is there a hit potential there? So far, no evidence. 

Anyone see a key catalyst for them?

I recently understood how a stock exchange worked at a low level, in principle. The exchange opens and starts taking ASK and BID orders in their book. If a BID order comes and there's an ASK order with a price lower or equal, the order gets fulfilled, if not it remains ""in the book"". And so, the price of the stock is determined by the line between the unfulfilled ASK and BID orders. [Like so](http://imgur.com/JWGfSnz) 

My question is: does a futures/options exchange works the same way?. For example does the NY Board of Trade works the same way as the NYSE? Or it's something completely different? How about a currency exchange, like FOREX?",5

16-07-22,4u2jdb,The Death of a Value Factor: The Arbitrage of Price-to-Book,"The [trending value strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/4qldg6/trending_value_breaking_down_a_proven/) buys the top 25 stocks by their 6 month price momentum among the top decile of stocks ranked by value composite 2 (VC2), a combination of price-to-earnings ratio, price-to-sales ratio, price-to-book ratio, earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization to enterprise value ratio (EBITDA/EV), price-to-cash flow ratio, and shareholder yield.

Price-to-book was touted by Ben Graham, the father of value investing, in his book The Intelligent Investor (""By far the best book on investing ever written."" - Warren Buffet) as a cornerstone of his rules for investing. Eugene Fama and Ken French published their famous three-factor model in 1992, which identified price-to-book as one of three factors that can explain the performance of a portfolio. They created a growth portfolio, comprised of stocks with the highest (top 30%) price-to-book ratios, and a value portfolio comprised of the lowest (bottom 30%) price-to-book ratios.

Since its publication, low price-to-book ratio has become the cornerstone of value indices, including the Russell 1000 Value (see page 25), the MSCI US Prime Market Value Index, and others, which are now tracked by hundreds of billions of dollars of value ETFs and mutual funds.

Any factor that is widely identified risks the chance of arbitrage. Essentially, as investors become aware of an anomaly (low price-to-book stocks performing well, in this case) and start tilting their portfolios toward that anomaly, it tends to be eroded away. Below is the recent performance of the top decile of stocks ranked by the various value factors of VC2.


[Nominal Return %, Top Decile of Various Value Factors \(Jan 1999 - July 2016\)](http://imgur.com/a/1Ktad)

The first thing that stands out is how well each factor has performed against the S&amp;P 500 over the last 16 years (it has be too good to be true, [right](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/4rugv1/what_wilt_chamberlain_can_teach_you_about/)?). The second thing that stands out is that price-to-book has been eroded as a value factor. It's reasonable to believe that the erosion is due at least in part to its identification and wide use as a value factor.

This erosion, in addition to historical long periods of underperformance, is reason for concern for the trending value strategy. It's reasonable to expect better performance if price-to-book was removed from VC2.

[Nominal Return %, Trending Value with and without Price-to-Book \(Jan 2010 - July 2016\)](http://imgur.com/a/T4pYU)

Removing price-to-book from VC2 does improve performance, though the trending value strategy has been pretty flat for the last 2 years, as stock prices continue to rise and the bull market continues.

In addition to dropping price-to-book from his value composite of evaluating stocks, it appears from his mutual funds' fact sheets that James O'Shaughnessy has replaced price-to-cash flow ratio with free cash flow to enterprise value.

[Nominal Return %, Top Decile of Various Value Factors \(Jan 1999 - July 2016\)](http://imgur.com/a/pHwTJ)

Free cash flow to enterprise value has been pretty much on par with price-to-sales and price-to-cash flow for the past 16 years, with price-to-cash flow actually outperforming free cash flow to enterprise value from about 2010 to 2015. But O'Shaughnessy has access to much larger datasets than I have available through Portfolio123, which may indicate larger advantages outside of the past 16 years. Additionally, free cash flow to enterprise value seems to have advantages over other traditional value factors, at least in theory.

Mimicking O'Shaughnessy by dropping price-to-book and replacing price to cash flow with free cash flow to enterprise value, value composite 4 (VC4) is born (VC3 was already named by O'Shaughnessy, as briefly mentioned here).


[Nominal Return %, Trending Value \(VC2, VC2 - PB, &amp; VC4\) \(Jan 2010 - July 2016\)](http://imgur.com/a/15byp)

The trending value strategy that uses VC4 finishes a touch ahead of the benchmark for this time period, and has exhibited a much flatter trend over the last ~2 years than trending value using VC2 or VC2 without price-to-book.

How these perform moving forward remains to be seen, and I'll continue to track both. But O'Shaughnessy himself altering the value composite from the one he published in 2011 is pretty strong evidence that he has acknowledged the arbitrage of price-to-book.",9

The restaurant chain's revenue also posted a miss, as comparable-store sales dropped more than expected. That came despite promotions and increased food safety measures in the aftermath of last year's food illness incidents.

So when Dave Ramsey talks about Investment Return of 12%, I supposed he is talking about ceiling value of S&amp;P500 performance since inception.

Personally, I'm of the belief that this market is more bloated than James Gandolfini after his last meal. That's not to say I don't see more gains on the horizon, just that this market will be eventually bested and fall well from where it's at right now.

With that said, would it be such a dumb idea to load up on SPXU and wait? It's dirt cheap considering the tear this markets been on and when the S&amp;P500 does fall it's a shoe in for massive profit. When 2008 hit you could have made a killing with it.

Long story short, the question is, will markets rise more than they could fall in the next 3 months? It's not entirely a coin toss, it's really a question of whether you see more upside or downside to our current setup. Am I retarded?

It seems to me that ecoli isn't even Chipotle's problem. Their revenue and EPS significantly dropped and it's probably a much larger underlying reason for it than a couple of ecoli outbreaks. Chipotle seems to have already hit market saturation in the United States, and I don't see much international success.

I also can't tell if doing a stock buyback is a good thing in their position. Right now they're still priced for growth (PE ratio ~43). Isn't it better to use that money to expand their business even more? I feel like a stock buyback at this point is saying ""we don't know what to do with our money anymore, but we're still going to buy back stocks even though we're priced for growth"".

For example, I understand why Apple's doing buybacks. They're making a shit ton of money, don't know what to do with that cash reserve, but now they're priced for value (instead of growth).

I disagree with their management and I think this buyback is a poor decision by Chipotle and I may be closing my position at a loss soon.",4

16-07-22,4u2y6f,Up nearly 2% despite missing on Q2,"One of my favorite holdings, AT&amp;T fell short of EPS and revenue estimates yesterday. They missed but not by a lot. 

AT&amp;T is up about 25% this year, this is arguably due to an unstable market as well as acquisition of Direct TV and several foreign telecom providers in Mexico. 

I love this stock for several reasons and you should too. I know many of you are always looking for the next hot thing or the next rocket ship with a launch date within a week. Sorry to say AT&amp;T is not that, AT&amp;T is a Mars mission that is years in the making. A company with a plan to take shareholders somewhere very successful but in a more sustainable way, seeking to avoid a challenger incident. 

So why are they doing well despite missing analysts estimates? A lot of this comes down to the guidance they offered yesterday. The areas they are targeting for growth, as discussed by the CFO, are exhibiting that growth. Direct TV and Mexico markets are a great example of this, along with business services, fiber connections and cell site expansion. 

Their decline in revenues comes directly from discontinuation of ""legacy"" services, 2g networks being an example of this. As they are working to cut this network out they are losing the business of those using it, that being said once they completely stop this service their costs will then be reduced significantly boosting their margin. Also very important is the frequencies that will be available once no longer occupied by their 2g network. 

AT&amp;T is also involved in the FCC auction for further frequency acquisitions and their previous acquisitions of smaller telecom providers have given them more access to broadcast frequencies, which is very important for a company like this. Did I mention they're developing and filing patents for 5g networking right now?

Their guidance touched on a few other things which really make the miss on earnings insignificant. Their cash flow is incredible, billions incoming from cash flow from operations and a heft sum of free cash flows is available to them. This means a lot to shareholders, because as many say ""cash is king"". They have the cash necessary to continue developing infrastructure and expanding in foreign markets, which represent huge areas of growth. 

Their debt position has been expanded and they are clearly aware of this. In order to acquire market share in Mexico and Direct TV as well, the company has taken on more debt then they usually have on the books. I don't see this as an issue, mainly because they're making these moves while debt is still cheap. The cash flows from these acquisitions and potential future growth outweighs the drag from increased debt especially in this economic climate. 

I believe this company has a very strong future. In providing entertainment service, business services, data transmission and consumer communications. Data is valuable, being able to provide it to consumers in a seamless way is important. As I've mentioned in another post (and some on my main accounts), with self driving cars, automation and the Internet of things fast approaching, the ability to connect these devices is paramount and AT&amp;T shows they are aware of this and are forward looking.

I'll leave you with a paraphrased comment from their letter to shareholders from year end 2015. The consumer doesn't care about whether it's WiFi, Satellite, Fiber or Cell towers providing them a connection, all that matters is we provide them with a seamless integration of these services so they can always be connected.

Them releasing a ""budget"" smartphone was also probably a good idea on their part since all of their other phones cost way too much money for what you're getting for them.

On the other hand, Apple Watch sales have apparently plummeted as of April, even though theyre outselling most other smartwatches. I just don't think people are into the whole smartwatch idea yet, sounds pretty fucking dumb if you ask me.

Their Q1 earnings weren't very good, but that's probably cuz they did shit all in Q1.

There is no single answer to this question, but we will also need A LOT MORE information if we are to give some sort of answer

* How old are you?
* Are you employed/making income? How much?
* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)
* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)
* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
* Any big debts?
* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.

Be aware that these answers are just opinions of Redditors and should be used as a starting point for your research. You should strongly consider seeing a registered financial rep before making any financial decisions!

They focus on Capital Markets, Principal Investing and Asset Management and CDO's so they are literally yoloing around money and investing which could potentially give the company huge earnings. 

They also offer a 9% Dividend.

They are competing. Still a high market cap means not many can buy them and they are some of the leaders in cloud. A billion revenue annually.

16-07-22,4u3vdj,"$TSLA and Uber, valuation comparison","Uber is currently valued at 62.5 billion, while TSLA is valued at 31 billion. 

From this I would argue that uber has done amazing things and transformed the landscape. I agree they are a valuable and profitable company. In the end they hold nothing proprietary though. They don't own the cars, the drivers are not under contract, and really what they have is a widely used app and a fleet of drivers that choose to be with them. 

What if, you cut out the driver part? How much is that worth to Ubers valuation? To estimate at this I would say you could take the total value a driver could make expect to make, less cost of vehicle, maintenance, and gas. This new total would be the per driver added value that Uber would now pocket. Take that and multiply it by 24 hour cycle instead of 8-12 hours a human drives, and then multiply it by how many uber drivers they have. (Side note, this is all estimating, Uber actually could figure this out to the dollar) Now, you have the added value to Uber. 

Take that same scenario, but if you are Tesla. You must build the app (1000% doable), then start producing the cars that Uber already plans on buying but you don't sell to Uber you create your own fleet. This in turn allows you to achieve the same value add as the driver removal above, plus there will be cost savings on the gas and you already have regional distribution in place and maintenance. 

I hate typing on my phone. But this is my first thought when I looked up what Uber was up to in value... Downside.... This is a long ways off and Elon could fail. I just think that logically one of the 2 companies values are off if you take a 10 year view at it. I normally post to WSB but they don't like long term talk. 

TL;DR how would you capture the Delta in expected value between these two companies? I am up for discussion.",7

16-07-23,4u6cet,"[NTDOY] Nintendo Downplays Pokemon Go Hype, My Analysis for the Future","Nintendo put out a press release today (https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2016/160722e.pdf) basically saying all the money they will make from PokemonGo is already in their financial forecast from last April.

What is encouraging is despite this press release the stock held firm at the second level of support of $28 (the other was $33) after its release. It could still fall through the floor, who knows.

This press release seems like a big lie to me. Nintendo does not want to admit that they had no idea how popular this game would be so they are trying to say they won't make money from it. They are trying to protect themselves from legal liability if they don't go to the moon with money spewing out in a trail behind them.

But they don't have to go to the moon, they just need to make more money than expected and surprise everyone. Which is what has happened. Here are the top reasons why NTDOY will rebuild value in my eyes:

1) PokemonGo has revitalized the Pokemon brand, it is literally a household name, not a single person does not know what a Pokemon is unless they live in a literal cave.

2) The classic NES (yes, that was accounted for in earnings) is going to be another sleeper hit, it is a perfect holiday gift. 

3) If the next home console turns out to be a hit, well we all know where the stock can go. This is like a 50-50 shot because Nintendo are stubborn and do their own thing to the point of determent (see not making smartphone games).

And the biggest reason to get behind Nintendo:

4) The cat is out of the bag on Nintendo Mobile, they see the money PokemonGo is making and are insanely jealous, they no longer have any excuse not to develop smartphone games. Nintendo has hundreds of classic NES and Super NES games just waiting to be put on iOS. Each one will sell millions of copies. Lets make a super conservative estimate that Nintendo released 100 games with 10 million downloads at 99 cents each. That comes out to 1 billion downloads raking in 700 million after Apple's cut. Knowing Nintendo, they will likely be $5 or $10 each and some will bring in a lot more downloads. Lets estimate in a moderate range of 100 games x 5 million downloads x $5 each is 1.75 billion for Nintendo. Plus they could cut a special deal with Apple giving them a better rate than the standard 70-30 model. This is all pure profit because these games are already made and ready to go.

The moment Nintendo announces their first upcoming release on iOS you watch this stock go to the moon. Hopefully they will have some games to release for this fall to test the waters.

16-07-22,4u45in,Unless you expect negative rates in the future I strongly suggest CDs over sovereigns and IG corporates,"Yields of up to 2.25% on 5 year CDs at credit unions with the same credit risk as US Treasuries, zero duration exposure besides (on average) 180 days lost interest on early withdrawal.

I don't see the upside potential on sovereigns being worth the risk at this point for your typical, unsophisticated investor. You have massive downside risk with little upside potential. Why play with the big boys in Treasury securities and even bond funds like AGG when you can receive significantly higher rates in a sector unavailable to larger players?

2.25% 5 year CD with a 1.125% early withdrawal penalty and no credit risk to principal versus 1.72% SEC yield on AGG with an effective duration of 5.19 years and credit risk.

In order to get the same benefits using sovereigns (obviously without the upside potential) you would have to purchase *30 year* Treasuries and even then they yield a mere 0.04 basis points higher than a 5 year credit union CD. 

Personally I think you'll see helicopter money before you see negative long-term rates in the US, so even in a recessionary environment I see little upside potential and massive risk to the downside.

Anyway, just my 2 cents since no one ever mentions CDs here. They certainly aren't inversely correlated with stocks as high quality bonds have been in the past so I suppose it depends on your monetary policy outlook in the event of a downturn.",26

So, I have a question about the TD Canadian TFSA. This morning I bought 5,000 shares worth of a company under the ticker symbol $GASS... I paid $3.19 per share. 

When the stock ticked up to $3.28, I went to check my account and realized that I Was only up less than $200, confused because I should be up around $400 after fees, I did some investigation. 

[Here is the little investigation I did](http://imgur.com/a/2ADjM). Essentially I paid $311.17 in mysterious fees to complete this trade. That's a lot of money to make a trade and I have no idea where this would come from? Has anyone had any experience with this? I was assuming that the only commission that I paid would be the $9.99 any any currency exchange fees...

Am I missing something here? Is there a huge markup on the currency exchange that I'm not aware of?

$311.17 sounds so ridiculous. Does anyone know about this? I'd love to hear some insight. 

Thanks. ",6

* If Q2 matches Q1 license revenue it will be 0% YoY growth.

After all this I'm still not sure... I'm leaning towards short as I think the market for BI has become saturated and Tableau cannot keep up. People that want to buy BI software have already purchased it at this point from Tableau or gone with alternatives (Amazon, SAP, Microsoft).

Nintendo owns lots more IPs, not to mention licensing, merchandizing, etc. There's lots more to Nintendo than just Pokemon Go. Pokemon Go gave Nintendo a new breath of life, I only see opportunity here. 

So can anyone with better insight than me explain the downfall of the stock? Should I hold long or is everyone just thinking that Pokemon Go is a one time deal and when the hype goes, so does the stock? I can get out now with minimal losses, but my gut feeling is that this bodes well for Nintendo in the future.",3

16-07-22,4u57uy,How legit is forextime.com?,"I have been looking into foreign exchange for a little while.

I've come across signal providers, which appear to be the best route if one has excess cash and little to no experience or knowledge in FX. However, after some research it seems like the general consensus among FX traders is that signals are not as reliable as they may appear, and that the strongest FX traders won't sell signals because it would be detrimental to their own trading potential, so they keep their methods secret.

But I have come across something that has been itching my brain for a while. On forextime they don't sell signals, instead they have what they call  ""investment managers"". They don't use their own money, but rather take a cut of the profits they earned using your money to trade. Obviously this is hit or miss, but there appear to be a few reliable traders who have done very well.

http://imgur.com/a/bPOSY (I apologize for cutting off the titles of the columns. They are 'currency' '1 month' 'all time' 'risk level' 'fee')

That is a screenshot of the top trading managers on forextime.com with the best ""700 THE POWER""  making a 1 month profit of 102% and an all time of 1607%.

My first reaction is that this is too good to be true. The fancy website design and enticing numbers they throw at you are designed to reel you in. But I can't shake the thought of handing over a few hundred dollars to one of these proven managers and seeing what happens. 

What is the consensus on this idea? Surely I'm not the first person to stumble across this and I want to know if it truly is too good to be true.

# Description
Annaly is a mortgage real estate investment trust. Its portfolio also includes residential credit investments, such as credit risk transfer securities and non-agency mortgage-backed securities. Its business operations primarily consist of Annaly Commercial Real Estate Group, Inc. (ACREG), which specializes in originating or acquiring, financing and managing commercial loans and other commercial real estate debt, commercial mortgage-backed securities and other commercial real estate-related assets; Annaly Middle Market Lending LLC (MML), which engages in corporate middle market lending transactions, and RCap Securities, Inc. (RCap), which operates as a broker-dealer, and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). 

It is managed by Annaly Management Company LLC. Wondering what the deal is there?

&gt; In exchange for the management services, we pay the Manager a monthly management fee in an amount equal to 1/12th of 1.05% of our stockholders’ equity (as defined in the Management Agreement).  We do not pay the Manager any incentive fees. 

## Recent financials 

Finance is really not the same as any other business. Just look at the smooth ""net interest income"" and the hideous ""realized and unrealised gains / losses"". 

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Net Interest Income | $1.7bn | $2.1bn | $2.3bn | $2.6bn | $3.1bn|
|Realized and unrealised gains / losses | -$1.0bn | -$2.8bn | +$1.6bn | -$0.7bn | -$2.6bn|
|Operating profit | $0.5bn | -$0.8bn | $3.7bn | $1.8bn | $0.4bn|

No wonder the EPS is a rollercoaster with multiple loop the loops. And still the dividends keep coming, with the net effect that shareholders equity continues to dwindle.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|EPS | $0.42 | -$0.96 | $3.74 | $1.71 | $0.37|
|DPS | $1.20 | $1.20 | $1.50 | $2.05 | $2.44|
|Total equity | $11.9bn | $13.3bn | $12.4bn | $15.9bn | $15.8bn|

## Competition

From their SEC filing

&gt; We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities and competition may limit our ability to acquire desirable investments in our target assets and could also affect the pricing of these securities. In acquiring our target assets, we will compete with financial institutions, institutional investors, other lenders, government entities and certain other REITs. 

So, here's the data we get from Reuters. But frankly, it really doesn't mean a lot to me :(

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Annaly Capital Management, Inc. | $781M | 15% | N/A
American Capital Agency Corp. | $174M | -ve | -ve
Starwood Property Trust, Inc. | $753M | 33% | 9%
New Residential Investment Corp | $812M | 43% | 16%
Chimera Investment Corporation | $831M | 69% | 8%
MFA Financial, Inc. | $545M | 57% | 10%
Blackstone Mortgage Trust Inc | $470M | 45% | 11%
Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc | $603M | 49% | -ve

## Cash / Debt?
Annaly Capital Management, Inc. has $60,670M of net debt. That is 518.5x it's latest operating profit. Again, the actual debt levels are pretty meaningless in Financials... or at least they don't make any sense to me.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $10.91 for Annaly Capital Management, Inc. and their recommendation to clients is _Hold_. That implies an upside of 1% to their target. So Wall Street isn't hot on this stock

# Valuation

Then we get to the valuation. Given REITs have to pay out their cashflow to maintain their tax status, it's hard for the PE and divie to diverge. 

But the tax situation is more complicated, as the REIT doesn't pay corporate and income taxes, instead the shareholder does. So an 11% yield from $NLY isn't the same as 11% from a widget maker.

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/nly/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:
NLY | $9,989M | 9x | -7% | 11% 
AGNC.O | $6,484M | 9x | N/A | 12% 
STWD.K | $5,093M | 11x | 6% | 9% 
NRZ | $3,088M | 7x | -1% | 14% 
CIM | $3,054M | 7x | 2% | 13% 
MFA | $2,779M | 10x | 2% | 11% 
BXMT.K | $2,700M | 11x | 3% | 9% 
IVR | $1,598M | 8x | -1% | 11% 

# Dividends
Annaly Capital Management, Inc. is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.17 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $1.20 per share. That is a decline of 3%. The forecast dividend of $1.17 compares to a forecast EPS of $1.21. Which isn't a shock given REITs having to payout their cashflow.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 6% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 5%. On 6 month basis the stock's up 22% even though the earnings are only up 5%. 

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/nly/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers.

&gt; In my remarks last quarter I also discussed our outlook for 2016. I stated that because of our diversified platform and low leverage profile, we were positioned to, take advantage of current market volatility, expected industry dislocations and the unforeseen opportunities we've been waiting for. I was signaling the benefits of and our desire for enhanced size and diversification in this volatile world.

So what did they do...they decided to buy another mortgage REIT, Hatteras. The deal will close later this year and perhaps it will give then increased scale? Cost synergies? A new pipeline of mortgage assets to acquire?

But is this all moot? Is it really just a play on interest rates and mortgage prepayments? A ""leveraged"" play? I don't get a lot of confidence from the CEO's comment that they want to get big and diversify ""in this volatile world"". 

Not my kind of investment, not a ""widows &amp; orphans stock"", is it. But would love to hear why anyone on this subreddit is a fan. Happy to be persuaded! :)

16-07-22,4u5epj,Evolution of the financial advisory business,"In this article [[link]](https://www.kitces.com/blog/actively-managed-etfs-for-financial-advisors-why-im-not-optimistic/) Michael Kitces talks about how the financial advisory business has changed from:

(1) being stockbrokers (until discount brokers came along) to

(2) being mutual fund salespeople (until online brokers came along and people could research and buy funds themselves) and finally to 

(3) being registered investment advisors offering wrap accounts focused on making asset allocation decisions for clients and overall financial planning and charging AUM-based fees.

Kitces then goes on to discuss how ETFs are increasingly used by advisors instead of active mutual funds so that the financial advisors can justify their fees (i.e. if they just put their clients into active mutual funds, the clients would wonder what value the advisor is adding).

The question that this raises in my mind (especially after having had some recent conversations with various financial advisors on behalf of my parents) is what actual investing expertise do financial advisors have?? Most are salespeople (i.e. getting new clients is the key to success in this business) and they have neither the time nor the experience to actually research and trade the markets. Some of the bigger financial advisory firms have in-house staffs that focus on making investments. But from the few that I spoke to, including  the investment committee members of some national firms, these guys didn't seem to be the brightest bulbs in the investment world.

**For those here who use financial advisors, what do you expect them to do to earn the 1% or so AUM fees?** Is asset allocation using index ETFs enough, particularly given the introduction of robo-advisors, who will do this component of the job for 25 bp? Are they doing handholding in other areas like tax and estate planning?? (The ones I spoke to didn't take on the functions of proper accountants or tax lawyers, which you'd still need to retain separately). In other words where is the value-added that justifies them in your mind? And if it's investment management services, do you believe that your financial advisor actually has the necessary experience and skills? And do you want them to start actively managing your asset allocation instead of sticking to a tame target date sort of program?

**If any of you are financial advisors, same questions, but from the other side of the table. How are you seeing the landscape change?** Are the bigger ($1-2 bn+) RIAs offering compelling in-house investment capabilities in your view? Especially for the smaller 1-10 person shop, what is your game plan for the next several years? Also how do the economics work if you are charging the client 1% and then you outsource to a TAMP or SMA program?",1

16-07-24,4ublq8,Stock picks of the week,"Hello peeps.  

I've been lurking r/stocks for years now.  I've decided to join you guys;  I'm surprised yahoo finance message forum has more action than Reddit.  I enjoy the well thought out posts here. I'm not a daily trader but I do trade one a week or so.  

Picks of the year for me are: 

1). TWITTER
- Twitter has few hundred million users and it's not going anywhere.  This company is going to get bought out. Seems as if companies have been waiting for it to bottom out before making a move.  $14 seems like the bottom. If it dips below $15 again i definitely recommend buying and holding.  Another thing I noticed after 3+ years of trading is that when there is a lot of negative sentiment on a stock by analysts it usually means it's a positive thing.  Furthermore, Twitter has more than enough cash on hand to basically ride out any wave.  

2). GLUU
Tencent has a stake in this company.  Tencent is a Chinese company that is worth over 250 billion that is willing to support GLUU anyway it can.  Pokemon Go paved the way for other companies such as GLUU to realize the untapped potential of phone gaming.  GLUU also has more than enough cash and no debt. This stock is waiting for jump. It jumps on every earning.  Word is that company is working on gaming similar to Pokemon go that involves real life interaction.  If it dips below $2.20 I'd def buy.  

3) RBS ( Royal bank of Scotland). Lloyds bank.  HSBC. BCS.  Any euro bank stock basically. Non of them are going anywhere.  Buy buy buy. I like HSBC because of its high dividend but I suspect there might be another drop.  One more drop before we get a bounce.  From my experience, when you think that a stock can't bottom out anymore, it usually does. 

Lastly, I am going to attach pictures of my stock picks so far as evidence.  I put my money where my mouth is.  Best advice I can give for newbies is to look at balance sheet. Easiest thing to do is look at cash on hand and debt.  It usually gives a clear description of the company and where it stands.

16-07-24,4ubluq,Recommendation for cheap/reliable electronic trading platform/company? Possibly one that is based on $/trade percentage vs. flat fee?,"I will start out by being honest and tell you that I am new to trading individual stocks on ""my own."" I am very familiar with commodities and the CBOT/CME. I actually work as a grain merchandiser and my company uses multiple trading houses to complete our trades through (not that it matters, but corn and soybeans.) I use a trading platform through one of our brokerage houses that our company has an account with where I do live, to the second, trading. I also do personal Bitcoin speculation through Coinbase. Not at any high volumes or frequencies but more so for hobby. I do some mutual fund 401k Roth investing with Vanguard accounts through my work pay checks.

I don't know if the NYSE has anything set up like that for ""normal"" people. I suppose for the live trading I would need to get some more registration/certification. I know a series 3 is needed for commodities but I'm not sure what all that allows you to broker for? Anyways, even a website similar to Ameritrade or Schwab would be fine. It definitely doesn't have to be live or me personally trading, but I would like something that is cost effective that I can do myself. I would prefer to do more things more similar to small trades daily or some smaller trades every few days or so. I'm not looking to make large investments (relative to my income) daily or ever really. I would just like to do some stock market investing and build a portfolio of my own with small transactions and over time build a ""sound"" portfolio.

Are they typically liable for fraudulent transactions or is the merchant? Also do they upgrade the card readers for free as a way to cover their ass (assuming they get held liable for fraudulent transactions) or do the merchants have to buy these new machines if they want to upgrade? Or do they get paid a transaction fee and the chip readers are a slightly higher fee compared to swipe?

16-07-24,4uc2dw,"[Need Advice] Bought AAPL puts, up but not sure if I should hold.","About a week ago I purchased 50 AAPL puts @ 95 strike expiring 3nd Fri of August for the earnings call this Tuesday.

Currently, I'm up about 40% on the trade.

I'm really unsure if I should sell the AAPL puts on Monday when IV rises further and take the profit, or if I want to risk holding. If I do hold, I was planning to sell 50 AAPL puts @ ~91 strike to try to hedge and mitigate the losses if AAPL remains flat or rises after earnings to deal with the IV crush.

Seems like the greedier play to hold the puts, however. I think walking away with a 40-50% gain on the trade is quite good since I'm pocketing a good profit but I also realize that if earnings or guidance falls short of expectations, AAPL can easily fall below the 95 strike by the expiration and I will make a killing + collect on the IV crush of the options I sold (less some black swan happens and AAPL tanks &gt; 10% which is highly unlikely). I was expecting that if AAPL does fall, it should be somewhere around $93 in 1-2 weeks. 

What would you do in my situation? Sell and walk away or hold and hedge with the credit spread? 

If I'm correct, holding could potentially net a 100-250% gain, or a potential 10-40% loss if things go against me. 

This is reminiscent of the time I got destroyed by holding through the brexit vote when I went long GBP... I'm still hurting from that loss, so I really want to sell... If anything, I could pawn off maybe 50-75% of my positions and hold a small portion, but I'm really not sure at this point. Pretty hard call to make. 

Any experienced traders please chime in. I think it's the novice mistake to hold and not take the gains when they're right in front of me and face the very real risk of losing it all... But I'm also such a greedy bastard HAHAHAHA. Earnings estimates from the street are actually pretty horrible, last quarter was ~1.97 EPS, and I believe this quarter the projections are ~1.40 EPS, so it's very possible that AAPL can outperform when the projections are so low. 

Edit: After reading through the comments, I've decided I'm going to sell somewhere around 70% of the holdings to secure profits Monday then sell a credit spread on the remaining positions, this way I've calculated if the position remains neutral/bullish I can still walk away with a very small profit of around 5-10%, and if I'm correct I still make a decent profit totaling ~60-100% of what I put in.

With that said, no chance for monster gains of 250%... But this is definitely the smarter play. Thanks for the input guys.

What are everyone's thoughts? I am a bit torn on this one, I think it will go sharply in one direction or the other. On one hand I think they will beat earnings, on the other hand I don't know what their guidance is going to be like. Biotech is hot right now, and this stock is praised over and over as a value stock with a 1 year target of $116.

They have some drugs going out of patent in early 2018. Truvada is a big one. I believe the old one is going out of patent but causes long term bone loss, they have a new formula that fixed that which I assume has a separate patent. They have a lot of drugs in regulatory approval and phase 3. Source http://www.gilead.com/research/pipeline

Truvada is huge, being the only approved pre exposure prevention treatment approved by the FDA. PrEP adoption and campaigning is huge in the gay community right now, and I believe the social acceptance of homosexuality leads to greater adoption of PrEP have less hesitation to bring it up with their doctors. Over the last year every gay I know has talked about getting on it or wanting to get on it. 

Gilead also dominates the HIV treatment market with several one pill a day solutions. While new HIV diagnosis numbers are dropping (partly due to Truvada as PrEP), the number of people on medication will only grow as it is a lifelong treatment and the average life expectancy for someone with HIV on treatment is only 5 years less than someone without HIV at all.

They have a very low P/E ratio at 7.4. Funding for HIV treatment is only increasing, and with more people getting health insurance I would assume that means more people on treatment.

Shares short has decreased 2.5 million over the past month representing 22.4 million of 1.3 billion shares outstanding (not sure if this is a lot of shorts or not relative). 1 year price target is $116. With lower EPS targets over the quarters I would assume if it is going to pop up towards that target it would be now.

16-07-23,4u8io0,Question about puts,"So here's my situation:

I want to buy a put on the SPY, as I think it is going to go lower. I strongly believe the market is going to take a large negative turn again.  So I was interested in buying a 200 strike put for Dec. 30 so I can capitalize on my hunch.

Obviously I would buy the put now, and then sell it again to someone else in a couple weeks/months when/if the SPY started going down again and I could make a profit.  But what obligations do I have beyond that?

I know if I buy the put I have the right to sell the shares at the 200 strike price, but not the obligation.  But if I re-sell the put to someone else, am I then on the hook for those shares for the guy who I sold the option to, or is it the initial writer of the option who is still on the hook (the ""obligation"" part of the option)?


I guess the basis of my question is, I don't want anything to do with exercising the option.  I'm not interested in actually having to buy or sell shares.  I don't want to be on the hook for having to get involved with the shares themselves, since I don't have the money to be responsible for 100 shares of a $200 ETF.  

I just want to speculate on where the SPY is going.  As you can see I'm pretty new to options and only have a rough estimation of what I am doing/talking about, so any insight is appreciated.

That peak was fueled by all manner of crazy loan schemes - when I was looking to buy another house in late '06 I kept hearing crap like ""don't put any money down, just take out a 2nd mortgage that's used as the downpayment for the first"" it was at that point I became convinced there was a bubble afoot. So all of the crazy mortgage schemes back then pushed prices way beyond what could be supported by actual incomes.  And of course, we know what happened...

Fast forward to now. Prices are even higher than they were then in many areas, but incomes haven't kept up - not even close. What's driven this runup? Some say it's all the easy money from the Fed finding its' way into Wall St. firms which are buying up houses to rent them out -  these are all cash purchases. It's difficult to find accurate data on all-cash purchases - I've seen numbers ranging from 15% to 40% in my area.

So if there was a bubble in home prices in '07, why isn't the current situation considered a bubble?  It also seems to me that interest rates will eventually have to revert to mean (between 6 and 7%) and at that point prices have to fall in order for people to afford the monthly payment. Of course, it could be a long time before we see interest rates rise here in the US so this could go on for some time.

Any thoughts on the potential for another real estate bubble? (I've got a rental, and I'm starting to get the feeling that maybe I should sell it and stash the money for a few years and buy later when prices are lower again, but I also worry that I could be several years too early with this thesis.)",2

16-07-24,4uczkd,Front Running and Limit Orders,"I've been reading Michael Lewis' ""Flash Boys"" recently, and have been trying to wrap my head around the idea of HFTs and front running. As I understand it, HFTs are able to use faster technology to not only monitor incoming orders to exchanges, but also move in front of those orders to increase price so that other orders are executed at prices higher than the buyer wanted.

My question is, why would someone place an order for a stock without some sort of limit? If you are continuously seeing your orders get subjected to some ""unknown"" phenomenon as mentioned in the book, when the trader clicks the buy button and the market shifts, then why wouldn't you just start setting a limit? As a trader, I would imagine you want to be precise in your trades anyways so just leaving technology up to getting you the best price seems like a bad idea. If you know what price you want to buy at, just set a limit, so that even if someone using technology to increase the price of the stock, your trade will only execute against the price you wanted, and not a higher price.",1

In an effort to make this place somewhat serious, I've created a survey for earnings plays for companies posting results Monday PM and Tuesday AM. I've made it so everyone who takes the survey can see the results instantly. I feel this will help shed some translucency on us as a hive-mind. I will post the results of our survey paired with the actual results sometime Tuesday so we can compare results.

If this is popular I will continue to do this every day for the rest of the week and post results accordingly. 

I have made it so you do not require a google login to take this survey but that means people can take it multiple times if they so chose, I ask you do not this for obvious reasons, if I notice abuse I will require a google login for the rest of the surveys. 

In the comments it'd be cool to see what your most confident pick is and why you chose it so we can get some reasoning behind it.

Any feedback on this would be much appreciated so I can improve this in the future!

16-07-24,4uaws6,Effect of warrants on stock price?,"Hey guys, I am currently looking at the company HTBX - it is a healthcare biotech focused on cancer treatment. The company's IP seems great (although I'm no healthcare expert), but after reading through some of the disclosures, it seems like the company's financial situation is not that great.

I was wondering if you could help me analyze the effect that outstanding warrants have on stock price?

Struggling for operational cash to complete its ongoing Phase II studies of some cancer drugs, the company recently conducted a public offering of 9,100,000 shares of common stock, and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 6,825,000 shares of its common stock. **The warrants are exercisable to purchase stock at a $1.00 per share.**

Currently, the stock is trading at ~**75 cents per share**.

My question is this - hypothetically, in the case that the stock ever hits $1.00 (I have doubts, but say it does), and the warrant holders chose to exercise the warrants, what effect are we going to see on stock price? How does the dilutive effect of warrant exercise affect stock price? Finally, is it possible that the $1.00 warrant price will create a ceiling for the share price, because current majority stockholders don't want the warrants to be exercised and have their stock diluted?

Any thoughts? ",1

If you don't believe in the predictive power of CAPE over the long-term this presentation isn't for you. If you believe we've entered a new normal the RRs also won't be indicative of future returns due to mean reversion to normal being reflected in asset pricing. Arnott makes a strong case for the predictive power of CAPE (&gt;85% correlation in most markets), but this also assumes that a new valuation standard (high multiples) is transient, not permanent.

&amp;nbsp;

https://vimeo.com/167847506/8f5a43d73f

&amp;nbsp;

Bright RR asset classes: EM equity (&gt;7% RR), EM debt (local, currency mean reversion a strong contributor), EM currency.

Middle of the road: Global equities, high yield (RR likely lower since rally), bank loans

Poor outlook: US bonds (&lt;1% RR), US equities (~1-1.5% RR), REITS

&amp;nbsp;

Notable mentions: Fundamental indexing should generate higher returns than market cap weighted indexing (don't think any low fee FI indexes exist). Vast majority of active management underperforms after fees (keep fees low). Equal weighting/more diversification of asset classes should up real return expectation. Rebalancing to overweight underperforming asset classes will likely generate additional alpha.

Previously, I'd give you some bullshit and call you all faggots, but it's time we make this sub great again. Disclaimer: I'm not an electrical engineering and I probably don't know what I'm talking about. Please feel free to correct me.

# What does Texas Instruments do?
Texas Instruments is in the semiconductor industry. They revolve around designing analog semiconductors (~80% revenue) and embedded processors (~20%). I don't know enough about these two things, so you'll have to go find an EE to explain these two to you.

# What Industries does TI sell to?
* Automotive (15% of revenue) - Infotainment, safety software, and all the stuff you don't have because you bought the base model you broke ass bitch.

* Industrial (30% of revenue) - Factory automation, medical devices, appliances, etc

* Personal Electronics (30% of revenue) - Phones, computers, that electric toothbrush your wife uses to pleasure herself because you can't.

* Other - Enterprise systems, communication equipment, calculators, and stuff

# How are these industries currently doing?

ETFs do a great job telling us how an industry is doing. Be sure to pay attention to how the general market is doing before going into your earnings play.

* Automotive ($CARZ) - **Bearish.** Their 2015 Q4 claimed that the strong auto industry significantly boosted their revenue, which makes sense because 2015 was a great year for car sales (with the low oil prices). However, notice how $CARZ has been in decline since 2015. There will likely be zero growth in this industry (and even more likely a decline).

* Industrial (Automation, Healthcare) - **Uncertain, leaning bearish.** TI definitely generates significant income from Factory Automation. We can track how well that industry is doing with $XLI. It seems like the manufacturing industry has stayed relatively flat except for that spike in July post-Brexit that was caused solely because of FSComeau. Regardless, this earnings report will not account for that spike. However, the Healthcare Technology, $IHI (**Bullish**), industry seems to be doing very well. Medical devices also usually use analog chips because they need to record real measurements (I'm not explaining analog vs digital to you mouthbreathers). **If there's any growth from TI, it will be in this sector.**

* Personal electronics - **Bearish.** I have no idea what TI does for smartphones and laptops/tablets - if someone can explain this that would be great. Regardless, smartphone sales have declined for the first time ever. As for laptops, I did some spot checking on companies such as Lenovo, Apple, HP, Asus, etc; they're all doing very poor.

# What is the general consensus of TI?

Texas instruments is up ~20% YTD for whatever reason. There was a small market correction of -2% the day after after Q2 earnings (-5% week after). The growth that they're seeing is absolutely absurd, and they should be in for another market correction this earnings. Their growth is already priced into the stock; which means that any indication that TI isn't going to continue to grow at 20% will cause a drop in price - even if they beat earnings. **I will be opening a short position when market opens tomorrow. http://imgur.com/eb7PI76.**

# Insider Trading
I don't open a position based of insider trading alone, but I definitely look at it to confirm my decision. More shares have been sold this quarter than have been sold in the entire year. 

# TL;DR. 

I've kept this post relatively PG-13, which means I can still drop the F word once. **Go Fuck Yourself and open a short position tomorrow.** 


TI is a great long term investment, the microprocessors they create is used in literally everything. But there's no reason why they should be seeing this kind of growth.

This has now garnered some attention for others where I have a couple other people wanting me to manage their money. Obviously, I'm hesitant to do so, but even more so concerned about the logistics. My trading strategy combines a few long term plays, but mostly quickly timed swing trades. I currently have 3 different brokerage accounts open at all times during the trading day. 2 of mine (yolo account and responsible account) and one for the guy I'm managing, and that's just too many damn windows. Not sure if anyone else has experience with this but I'm not trying to create a hedge fund or anything, and hoping there's an easier way than taking my series 7 and all that jazz. I've heard of things like C2 that mimic my trades in others' accounts but not sure how it would work when I'm trying to scalp on like 15 minute swings or trade not-very-liquid options and stuff like that. 

Help me lose some more people money WSB. ",21

16-07-24,4ue8q4,Verizon Finalizes $4.8 Billion Yahoo Deal,"From The Wall Street Journal:

""Verizon Communications Inc. has agreed to pay $4.8 billion to acquire Yahoo Inc., according to a person familiar with the matter, ending a drawn-out auction process for the beleaguered internet company.

The price tag, which includes Yahoo’s core internet business and real estate, is a remarkable fall for the Silicon Valley web pioneer that once had a market capitalization of more than $125 billion at the height of the dot-com boom.

For Verizon, the deal simply adds another piece to the digital media and advertising business it is trying to build.

The deal is expected to be announced early Monday. The price was earlier reported by Bloomberg News.""

16-07-24,4ue9h3,Trip Advisor,"I'm really not sure if this is the place to post this info, but I own a small inn and we have been a long time client of Trip Advisor's.  Though the annual fees have risen from (off the top of my head) $1300+ in 2014 to $1700+ in 2015 to $2300+ in 2016, we have generally found some value in membership at this price point.  We just received notification that fees for 2017 will be $8000+.  Our property is affiliated with a group of innkeepers and the overwhelming majority are not planning to renew at that price point.   Now the caveat here is that TripAdvisor when contacted is showing a great deal of flexibility in substantially lowering the renewal price (and may in fact relent and allow properties to renew at close to their 2016 levels.). Regardless, I believe they are taking a substantial risk trying to impose a 400% price fee increase on subscribing properties.  Netflix got a ton of backlash for an annual increase of 15 or so % and while the services are completely different, I believe that Trip Advisor may be playing with fire here.

I don't have anything invested in the stock and really don't know anything about it from a DD standpoint, I just figured that those that either had a position or were considering one might want to know what was occurring on the ground level.

Does any one have preferred methods and also do you use local banks or online banks? What tools can I use to help me see which CD's have a better return for their term i.e. Assuming the minimums for both Bank A and B were $1,000. Bank A has a 3 month CD with a .75% return where as Bank B has a 6 month CD with a 1.5% return. Would it be smarter to get 2, 3 month CD's from bank A, one after the other, or would it be smarter to just go with Bank B's 6 month CD? Thank you for the help.

16-07-25,4ui7x1,"Contract for Difference - What's the catch?","I trade US stocks and commodities such as gold. Usually my holding period would be 1 day up to 1 month. For this purpose, I found CFD is just too good comparing to my local stock broker (in EU). The CFD broker I'm dealing with is ig.com, so far I can see it has:

- Access to a wide range of markets

- Short selling

- Usually cheaper brokerage fee ($0.02 per share vs. 0.2% at my local broker)

- Offers high leverage

- Transactions are settled immediately (it takes 3 days with my local stock broker)

- Guaranteed stop

- Trading APIs


Some bad things I found about CFD:

- Overnight holding fee (1-month LIBOR + 2.5% annualized) - still much cheaper than taking a loan from bank (8% margin at my local bank plus other significant fees)

- Lots of negative reviews for all CFD brokers on the internet, mostly for stop loss slippage or unavailability in high volatility time, some has tricky user agreements.

- Prohibited in US


What am I missing? Should I avoid CFD brokers (or specifically ig.com)?


I have put a few thousand euros in ig.com to try trading with the broker for a month. Things have been good so far. I haven't tried withdrawing the money yet. Actually it's very tempting to put more money in and do all short to medium term trading there because I made better profit with less capital than trading with my local stock broker.

16-07-24,4uf65j,Depressing or just depressed? Uranium and Potash,"The trend for these 2 commodities has been down so long that I really believe these are due for a turnaround. Of course I'm using my traditional style of investing to put it all on red. That doesn't mean that you can't play this way safer, take a fair yield and still make out like a bandit, relatively. Here's the price charts for [uranium over the last last 28 years](http://imgur.com/a/gBrDG) and [potash over the last 10 years](http://imgur.com/a/jwqLA). 



Companies in my wheelhouse for uranium are Ur-Energy Inc (TSX:URE) and Nexgen Energy (TSX:NXE).
URE is just about breaking even at these rock-bottom prices. The reason, they've secured contract prices ~40/lb for uranium.  
NXE is in exploration and has found deposits in the ~15-25% grade uranium (a traditionally great grade would be ~2%). It's properties are immediately next to Cameco's and it is also definitely an acquisition target.

A company that would be more suited to the needs of a more *prudent* investor would be **Cameco Corporation (TSX:CCO)**. For the same reason that you may avoid commodity-linked stocks, the price of this stock is quite depressed(depressing). However, they have contract prices in the mid $40s/lb, they are turning a profit, and they are giving a **~3% divided** in this environment. 

Here's a nice piece by Rick Rule of Sprott Global Resource Investments:  https://youtu.be/2TPQHpe2TD8?t=20m45s


~~~

For potash my insane gamble is Gensource Potash (CVE:GSP). When they begin producing products, they are supposed to be profitable at current potash prices and even lower. Their only downside is the capital expenditures they have slated for 2017-2019 ($200 million).   
 
In terms of potash prices rebounding, I don't see that happening in the next year, but am looking more toward 2018/2019. That's why I'm investing in a junior who plans to mature to production right at that moment. They're building their operation out in the best possible environment for credit. 

In terms of established companies, I think of **Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (TSX:POT)**. It's still turning a very small profit with potash prices at $227/tonne and has a **dividend of ~5.5%**. I believe it will be back to climbing toward it's former glory when potash prices begin to rebound in (hopefully) 2019. 




Now there may be a bit of a ride down further with the commodity prices, who knows, and thus the stock prices of these companies. I believe Cameco and Potash Corp will remain solvent though to the up-swing of the price cycle. Could be wrong. But if I'm right... goddamn dawg.

16-07-25,4uito3,Friend wants me to manage some of his money,"Hello all.

I have a friend who I share investing and trading strategies with. Over the past couple of years I've done pretty well in the market and this friend in question would like me to manage a percentage of his portfolio. I told him I would need to research the regulatory ramifications and the tax ramifications before I do anything, but I have no idea where to start (in terms of licensing and tax treatment). I planned on getting in to money management after my personal portfolio had 5 years of history behind it, but with his request, I would like to at least start heading in that direction. I have 2 years of established history. I have a trading plan and prospectus all put together, but again, I know there are legal parameters to follow and tax guidelines to avoid pitfalls, I just don't know where to begin to get in to all of that.

I don't plan on making him or myself a millionaire, I'm not unrealistic. I know I will need a series 7 most likely, but without sponsorship from a firm, can I get that on my own accord through an LLC? Once I am in a position to, I am going to hire an accountant and a lawyer for these matters, but as of right now, I just want to familiarize myself with the legal and tax side of things.

16-07-25,4uixsj,Defaults heat up,"The weather…we spend 10 full months of our lives talkin’ about it, but somehow we just can’t get enough. To work into your Monday morning catch-ups, there’s something other than the climate that’s heating up: HY default rates. 

At 5.1%, the US HY default rate is the highest in 6 years, more than doubling from a year ago as the magnitude of Energy and Metals and Mining defaults exceeded our expectations. To adjust for the lagged effect of recent commodity defaults, we are nudging up our year-end default forecast to 5.75-6.25% range (from 4.5-5%), before returning  back towards 5% by the end of 1H2017. Despite the rise in defaults, our thesis remains-intact “what happens in commodities, mostly stays in commodities” with little spillover into the rest of the HY market. This is because HY defaults have a strong “business cycle” component, i.e. when US recession risk remains low, so too does the spillover from commodity defaults to the broader market. 

**Defaults in numbers: Still a commodities story**

*   33…total number of issuers defaulted in 2Q, taking the default rate to 5.1%, the highest since 2010 
*   39.7%...default rate in HY E&amp;Ps, a rapid acceleration from a year ago when the default rate was 8.8%
*   16.3%...default rate in HY Metals and Mining issuers, which has actually declined from 22% in 1Q 
*   30 years...how long it’s been since the combined HY Energy and Metals and Mining default got this high (at nearly 22%)
*   3/4ths…of the total default debt over the past 12 months has been in Energy and Metals and Mining sectors on a dollar basis
*   2.4%...the HY default rate when excluding Energy and Metals and Mining sectors, nearly half the long-term average.

**What should cool down? in a line**

HY Metals and Mining compression…spreads in the sector traded over 1000bp wide to the HY index in Jan/Feb, but that gap has shrunk to &lt;100bp, driven by recent asset sales and over $1 trillion of stimulus from China in 1Q, trends that we do not think will be sustained in the next leg of the long, W-shaped recovery for metals and mining commodities (read our analysts’ fantastic report here)

**What should stay hot? in a line**

Foreign investment into USD credit… USD credit has attracted $148bn of capital from foreign investors, cumulatively, since the start of 2015 through May, 80% of which has come from Europe where nearly half their bond market is yielding below 0%; we expect this trend to continue in the global hunt for yield.

**Fun fact: the average person complains for about 34 minutes on a Monday morning, compared to 22 minutes on other days of the week.**

With Mr/Mrs/It. Janet Yellen speaking on Wednesday I need a good play so I can jerk myself off at the end of the week and tell my parents how good of a trader I am.

It is seeming like rate hikes are NOT coming this September especially with the economic uncertainty and BOE not raising and brexit, and Asian people and this random marketwatch article and blah blah blah (Insert all factors from other posts).

Heres the real kicker. It is from my understanding that historically there is no real correlation between gold prices and rate hikes, but If my memory is correct, $DUST jumped up last time Yellen said we were not raising rates, and it also jumped when BOE said they weren't raising rates.

Im thinking about hopping into Dust tomorrow. 

1. Does anyone have a good reason that rates will raise?

2. If rate hikes are discussed, logic says that people will buy into gold. Prove me wrong?

Im looking into a short position of course, so If someone can come in here and swing there big gold cock and drop some knowledge that would be great, because lord knows I need it.
I dont mind being wrong here, I just want to be on the correct side for Wednesday (Jnug or Dust).

P.S GFM and GFY if all you post is ""($Stock) to the moon"" Edit&lt;- Saying this was a bad idea but leaving it in because GFM

EDIT: Apparently 15 Central Banks are meeting this week including Japan on Friday, my guess is most of them will have similar positions on rate hikes as the US right?
EDIT: To add more confusion heres an article that say they could raise rates at the end of the year

16-07-25,4uj2vg,Traveling last week and forgot all about $RLYP,,30
16-07-25,4uj330,"$RLYP, Options.","This will probably be my final RLYP post for you guys. I am starting to get a headache thinking about this.

**This is my final play on RLYP unless something drastic happens**

I would like to quickly reiterate what has happened so far:

- ZS-9 bought out for $60, before approval.
- Veltassa approved with BB warning.
- Short interest reached 60-65% of float on RLYP.
- ZS-9 received a Complete Response Letter regarding manufacturing issues. 
- ZS-9 has 6-8 months at least before secondary test, which I still believe will be denied
- RLYP is bought out for peanuts at $32 a share by Galencia. 

**Red Flags**

- Galencia is posing themselves as another competitor in the US market by having a major drug in RLYP. This means less cash and more competition for big pharma. I don't believe they want this.
- AZN has burned themselves significantly here, I believe they will think it is better to double down, than to lose out completely AND gain a competitor. 
- $32 is just ridiculous when there was just information being floated regarding a $3B a year turnover for ZS-9 or Veltassa. 
- The short position was intriguing, it didn't make sense. Now all of these shorts are effectively gone (we will see late this week), I wonder if whoever was shorting, will look to buy the company instead. 

**Personal Thoughts**

So we all profited greatly on this RLYP trade. I know it made me a lot of money, which is fantastic! However, there is still a considerable amount of cash being left on the table. I am still holding my stock until the deal is done. Usually I would be out, as too many things could go wrong, but Galencia seems ready to me. So either way, I get my $32. 

I believe John Orwin had to do something. There wasn't enough exponential growth to force a price hike, even though growth was fantastic. Shorts were forcing the numbers down, stopping any natural growth. By him accepting this BO offer, he killed all the shorts and is now forcing the hand of the other pharmas. This is a huge power play to me. 

I move now to options. As cheap as they are, I can't see anything but a small loss, or a gigantic win. I truly don't believe big pharma wants another competitor, with Hilary on the horizon, it will just eat away at future profits. Not good for them. This leaves only one alternative, a significantly higher buyout price. My first inclination is the $40, 25% higher than the current offering. This is an offer that could not be turned down, otherwise lawsuits will become very apparent for the board for not fulfilling their fiduciary duty. 

All in all, this leaves me with my position. I have since purchased the following:

- RLYP 09/16/2016 33.00 C --&gt; Volume of 400. 

I am expecting at least a $40 price hike from this stock, and potentially more. I have eight weeks from today for any rise above $33 to happen, and I still believe we could be seeing something quite a bit higher than that. 

Once again:

*If you win, I win*


**UPDATE July 25th 2016 4:10pm ET**: I am now XXX options deep on September 16th $33 calls. I am sold on this, and I am expecting another higher buyout. I expect to make at least a 23x return on these options. Happy playing! ",31

SY-1425 - the north american drug that will potentially cure acute myeloid &amp; acute promyelocytic leukemia, as well as breast cancer, all before they actually happen.  looks like it consists of retinoic acid receptor agonists to be used in patients who are genetically susceptible to these diseases. they are focusing their research on the non-coding region of the genome - which makes up 98% of our DNA. i guess non-coding region of dna can drive diseases despite seeming relatively unimportant. they'll be one of the first to study this region of dna and hope that theyll find methods to alter dna with use of RAR agonists. Now im not entirely sure what all of this means but they seem to be confident that this market is relatively untapped.  further dd will have to be done to find other drugs in this market and their effectiveness towards these cancers.  also might have to dig to find any current data on their studies. probably not much coming out about it as theyre early in testing but im sure theres something that im too lazy to find.

only glaring fault as far as the untrained eye can see is the financial situation.  no revenue as no drugs are currently on the market.  this wont be a problem unless research for sy-1425 hits a snag in phase II/III testing. 

If anyone wants to add some analysis of their financials or how effective this treatment could be feel free to add on.  just a quick thing i put together at work so if you dont like it gfy

TL;DR - syros has tons of potential, looks like it could be the first company to address genome modification to prevent cancer in susceptible patients, but no financials could be an issue",5

For example (completely made up figures here), last 6 months S&amp;P up 50%, GOOGL up 49%, AAPL up 24%. I am looking to find a bunch of AAPL's that are not tracking to the market so consistently

I understand that I could look at beta, but I don't think that's what I'm looking for

any ideas?",1

So what? I have calls on USO, Calls on GDX. Spy puts, Vix Calls. in various amounts. I have no idea what will happen and neither does anyone here but insights and YOLOs welcome. Would love a pro oil trader come on here and tell me this FED meeting will simultaneously lower the dollar and we get out EIA reports. Boom! double whammy pop on oil Wednesday?

For example, Brexit. Or Nintendo's recent rise, and then more recent drop.

Basically, the idea here is that traders need something to signal their next move. Information, while of course having long-term impact on fundament value, might in the short-run serve as a useful Schelling point.

16-07-25,4ujaux,VZ sucks lol. What does it all mean?!,"Verizon looks like it wants to capitalize on the daily active users still going to Yahoo! by advertising to them through mobile platforms, etc. Google has been destroying Yahoo! over the past decade in the market of email, news, and increasingly finance too.. This is both fact and sentiment. What VZ is buying, is the core of the total Yahoo valuation of 40b+... but this is an investment for the future. Maybe it will pay off since Yahoo! still holds some share of internet traffic- but it is very small compared to Google + Facebook. VZ will be scrutinized heavily for this.

There is a lot of people who would invest in Verizon (IT IS THE LARGEST wireless communications company in the US)- but not in Yahoo!, just based on the general sentiment towards Yahoo!. By pitting themselves against Google for a time- Yahoo! is cursed being evaluated against its extremely successful and powerful competitors. By selling out, they prove that they've been mismanaged and are looking for a way out. It doesn't matter what Verizon does at this point with Yahoo- it is taking on negative publicity at a vulnerable time given that the stock of VZ is hitting new highs.

Even if some people are calling this a good purchase, Verizon/Yahoo stock is falling today as a result of the announcement. VZ purchased AOL in Jan 2015 with the same goals to monetize advertising to the few who still used that service. Companies like Google and Facebook are already so heavily integrated in email and other mainstream services already- Verizon is extremely late to the party. 

There is no reason for people to leave Google/FB for an inferior- less integrated service, and tomorrow's earnings report for Verizon will be telling a big story. They only stand to gain from international traffic- like in China where Google is blocked. Google is also pushing communications providers into faster services by providing cheap fiber optics in certain US cities. Verizon is a bloated giant, with lots of revenue from overpriced services. Its purchases to maintain revenue streams in advertising + data are just typical of struggling innovators in technology. If you can't do something special, better to use your buzz to coast into obscurity than admit you cannot compete with the big boys who actually care about giving consumers good, fairly-priced services and tank all at once. Verizon is a cell carrier and so it shall remain.

Consider loss of revenue from Q2- this could be a catalyst for the correction when earnings are announced tomorrow morning.
[Verizon strike of 2016 - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_strike_of_2016)

Also, consider the recent criticisms of Verizon for its involvement in political donations, and the further smearing of the Democratic party as a result of the DNC email leaks that recently came out.

And just to show how poorly Yahoo! is faring against its competitors:

I was correct on 5/8 of my PM guesses, not a bad score. Hopefully the AM drives my total up. I'm more so excited to see how WSB does as a whole compared to actual results. 

/u/business2690 made some suggestions on improving the survey so I have made changes this time around. More suggestions are welcome, and as always. If this stays popular / relevant I will continue to compile the data and post results.

16-07-26,4unl2d,Is it unusual/discouraged to use multiple brokers for different purposes?,"I've got about $10,000 that I'd like to start investing. For the last several days I've been researching different online brokers (saw Barrons reviews and lots of other resources, asked personal opinions of friends and family, etc). It's clear that there are several highly-rated brokers with different strengths and weaknesses.

If I plan on mixing shorter-term trades with long-term trades, would it be unusual or discouraged if, for example, I placed a proportion of my $10,000 in TD Ameritrade (for buy-and-hold investments, and also to take advantage of the tools/research/learning/apps) and the rest in another broker with potentially less support but also much lower fees (e.g. Tradeking) for shorter-term trades?

From searching back through this subreddit it seems there are many users here (as well as one of my non-redditor family members who's a full-time trader) who recommend Interactive Brokers. Rather than juggling multiple brokers for different purposes would it be wiser to just use IB for everything, since I'm already willing to put in a maximum of $10,000 which happens to be IB's minimum deposit last I checked?",2

New to Reddit and thought id share a few bits from my UK long portfolio. This is not advice its just an insight.

Heaviest Weighting to lightest

SL. Been under the kosh due to brexit however its overdone and currently paying 6% dividend.

ITV. Looking like the could potentially become a takeover target to a US firm due to the currency movement.

IAG. Again has come under fire in the brexit fallout however the world doesn't stop and people need to fly.

WTB. Strong brand and will benefit from people holidaying in the UK and visiting the high streets.

MERL. Own theme parks/attractions and again due to currency movements look set to benefit from people taking staycations and also holidaying in the UK.

SXX. Very interesting Potash play. Still in a risky stage but has been rewarding shareholders and with currency movements looks like it could win some decent export contracts.

Will report back in due course with updates! 

Feel free to ask questions.

If your looking for stocks to suit different risks then fire away!

I wonder if any of you guys know why there is nothing like Vanguard 500 ETF for the Indonesian stock market? I'm looking to invest for a long term in some sort of index fund, but as far as I can find, there isn't any. The closest thing is the LQ45 fund, which tracks the 45 most liquid companies in the IDX (Indonesian Stock Exchange), but I think the fee is outrageous (2% buying fee, 2% selling) for an index fund. Why isn't there someone that creates an ETF that duplicates the IDX' movement and sell it at a cheap fee?

Lastly, what do you guys suggest? Should I look out for the international index funds instead? I don't think I can buy from Vanguard without some kind of nasty taxes.",1

Ive been interested in stocks and thought they were fun to play around with so I've been transferring money to Robinhood to kind of forget about it. I always make sure that I'm not making ridiculously risky plays so that over a span of the month I won't lose that much money as opposed to having it in my bank account where I'll probably feel like I have a surplus of money and end up spending it. 

My question is when I do my taxes will I be taxed on just the difference between how much I've made and how much I've invested in total? Say I've spent $1000 and made $100. Do I just get taxed on this $100 even though I've bounced this money back and forth between the market and Robinhood?

16-07-25,4ukc9m,TWTR and FB earnings play,"Buy TWTR puts. I am long the weekly $16 strikes for TWTR. Why?
-TWTR in recent weeks has risen close to 30% due to speculation that there is a buyout on the backdrop of linkedin. This ain't happening people. This is Jack Dorsey's love child, he didn't come back to sell off his company. He has something to prove to the world, so being acquired is off the table
-Yes, they are being more creative with streaming live content, this is not going to be reflective of last quarter. Going forward revenue may pick up steam, but as of right now they are making timely acquisitions to increase their content. This means spending money
- Expectations aren't super high and yes that means it could be an easy beat, but there is more downside than upside at this point in time
-buy cheap puts 

I am also long FB shares and short FB puts ($112 strikes)
- FB is a monster clear and simple
- they've proven that they are monetizing their apps and instagram has been great at pulling up their bottom line
- The problem is that everyone expects FB to do well. I expect numbers to be great as well because they still have yet to monetize whatsapp and VR
- However this means it is also harder for them to beat. The better play here is to write out of the money puts for high premium as this stock is expected to move. Collect that volatility

# Description
Robert Half International provides specialized staffing and risk consulting services. It operates through three segments: temporary and consultant staffing, permanent placement staffing, and risk consulting and internal audit services. 

## Recent financials 

Given the economic backdrop, it's not surprising to see how well sales and profits are doing!

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $5.1bn | $4.7bn | $4.2bn | $4.1bn | $3.8bn|
|EPS | $2.69 | $2.26 | $1.83 | $1.50 | $1.04|

## Competition

&gt; The Company’s staffing services face competition in attracting clients as well as skilled specialized employment candidates. The most significant competitive factors in the staffing business are price and the reliability of service, both of which are often a function of the availability and quality of personnel.

Given that description it's pretty remarkable to see the margins are returns of $RHI. Clearly the management team is doing something right!

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Robert Half International Inc. | $5,192M | 12% | 36%
CDI Corp. | $962M | N/A | -ve
Kelly Services, Inc. | $5,547M | 2% | 7%
Kforce Inc. | $1,329M | 6% | 31%
ManpowerGroup Inc. | $19,375M | 4% | 16%
Resources Connection, Inc. | $595M | 9% | 9%

## Cash / Debt?
Robert Half International Inc. has $213M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 4% of the market value of $RHI. I wonder if that's the right thing to do, given how the industry can get pummelled in a recession!

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $46.89 for Robert Half International Inc. and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 14% to their target.

# Valuation

The PE ratio isn't racy, the FCF yield is good and the stock pays a dividend. Okay the other big player, MAN is a little cheaper, but does that just reflect it's business mix, profitability and returns?

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/rhi/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
RHI | $5,381M | 14x | 9% | 2% | 10%
CDI | $125M | -ve | N/A | 0% | -ve
KELYA.O | $791M | 13x | N/A | 0% | 12%
KFRC.O | $536M | 12x | N/A | 0% | 12%
MAN | $5,033M | 12x | 9% | 2% | 13%
RECN.O | $551M | 18x | N/A | 0% | 8%

# Dividends
$RHI's forecast to pay a dividend of $0.87 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $0.82 per share. That is a 6% growth. The forecast dividend of $0.87 compares to a forecast EPS of $2.95. So lots of room there. And management seems to be using any excess cash to repurchase stock.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -6% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -2%., so a little slippage in it's PE ratio, though on a 6 and 12 month view the stocks gone sideways with earnings doing up. i.e. the PE multiples been falling. 

Is that a reflection of people thinking the cycle is near the top? That we are nearing peak earnings? Strange if so, as the last 3 months saw sales up 8% with growth across all divisions.

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/rhi/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers.

&gt; We feel we will continue to benefit from a widening skills gap in a number of our professional specialty areas. Employers that are struggling to find needed talent are recognizing that flexible staffing can help them manage total labor costs and also increase the pool of potential full time talent through temporary-to-hire arrangements.

So they don't see any headwinds for the business. And their risk-management / audit consulting arm, Protiviti is doing particularly well. Seems like the only thing to worry about is the economy?

shares fell 3.2% in Tuesday premarket trading after the sports apparel and accessories company reported second-quarter earnings that fell, but met expectations. The company had net income of $6.3 million, or 12 cents per share, versus net income of $14.8 million million, or 3 cents per share, for the same period last year. Revenue for the quarter totaled $1 billion, up from $783.6 million for the same period last year, also meeting the FactSet consensus. 

International sales represented 15 percent of total sales but grew 68 percent compared with the second quarter of 2015. The brand has opened 60 new international Under Armour stores this year.

Within product categories, Under Armour saw its strongest growth in footwear, where sales climbed 58 percent to $243 million as consumers bought from the Stephen Curry signature basketball line and running and cleated shoes.

--------------------------------------------------------------

McDonald's Corp $MCD - 

posted weaker-than-expected same-store sales in its latest quarter, a sign that the boost from its all-day breakfast offerings may be receding.
Shares fell 3% to $123.6 in premarket trading.

Over all for the three months ended in June, McDonald's reported a profit of $1.09 billion, or $1.25 a share, compared with $1.2 billion, or $1.26 cents, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $1.45 a share. Analysts had projected $1.38 in per-share earnings.

All-day breakfast continued to power domestic sales, but the company said it faced ""softening industry growth"" in the period.Since taking the helm last March, Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook has moved to bolster the company's sales by paring down its menu, offering more transparency about how its food is made and launching all-day breakfast at many of its domestic restaurants.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Verizon Communications Inc. $VZ-

reported second-quarter earnings above Wall Street expectations a day after reaching a deal to acquire Yahoo Inc.'s core internet business. Verizon reported net income for the quarter was $831 million, or 17 cents per share, compared with $4.35 billion, or $1.04 per share during the same quarter a year ago. 

Verizon said earnings were negatively impacted by 7 cents due to the seven-week strike by employees in its wireline business. Excluding non-operational items, earnings were 94 cents per share, just above the FactSet consensus of 92 cents. Revenue for the quarter hit $30.53 billion, a 5.3% decline compared with $32.22 billion in the year earlier period. 
The FactSet consensus on revenue was $30.84 billion. 

The cable, internet and phone company said the strike also resulted in a net decline of 13,000 Fios internet connections and 41,000 video connections. The company also mentioned its $4.83 billion deal on Monday to buy Yahoo's core business, which is expected to close in the first quarter 2017. ""By acquiring Yahoo, we are scaling up to be a major competitor in mobile media,"" Chief Executive Lowell McAdam said in a statement. ",33

From reading the earnings report, there's no doubt TXN delivered earnings that was better than what my DD predicted. However from reading their earnings report I really have a hard time understanding why TXN is doing so well. Currently TXN is up 42% YTD right now. Perhaps they were undervalued previously, but there's no reason why any company should have this kind of growth where their revenue barely increased. They're not expanding to new sectors or getting new clients; they're just streamlining their business and making it more efficient.

Regardless, my word is probably meaningless after this event. I personally still believe they're due for a market correction (20% drop in a month) any day now, until they can actually start showing an increase in revenue.

Out of respect for everyone that lost money, I'll stop posting until I make it big again.

## Recent financials 

You could be forgiven for thinking that smoking was a growing business...

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $10.7bn | $8.5bn | $8.2bn | $8.3bn | $8.5bn|
|EPS | $2.57 | $1.37 | $1.57 | $1.12 | $1.20|

But it was an acquisition that gave the boost.

&gt; On July 15, 2014, RAI, Merger Sub and Lorillard entered into the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which RAI agreed to acquire Lorillard in a cash and stock transaction.

## Competition

&gt; RJR Tobacco’s primary competitors include Philip Morris USA Inc., Imperial and Liggett Group, as well as manufacturers of deep-discount brands. RJR Tobacco had an overall retail share of the U.S. cigarette market of 32% v Philip Morris' 50%.

&gt; Competition is based primarily on brand positioning, including price, product attributes and packaging, consumer loyalty, promotions, advertising and retail presence, as well as finding efficient and effective means of balancing market share and profit growth. Cigarette brands produced by the major manufacturers generally require competitive pricing, substantial marketing support, retail programs and other incentives to maintain or improve market position or to introduce a new brand or brand style. 

So despite the nasty image... the margins and returns are sweet. Though I don't understand why Imperial is so low...

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Reynolds American, Inc. | $11,535M | 40% | 50%
Altria Group Inc | $25,696M | 35% | 206%
British American Tobacco PLC (ADR) | $17,219M | 39% | 82%
Imperial Brands PLC (ADR) | $34,119M | 14% | 23%
Philip Morris International Inc. | $26,051M | 41% | N/A
Vector Group Ltd | $1,677M | 15% | N/A

## Cash / Debt?
Reynolds American, Inc. has $9,261M of net debt. That is 2x it's latest operating profit. Clearly the acquisition of Lorillard (cash and shares) has been managed nicely. Not pushing them into a problematic debt position.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $54.88 for Reynolds American, Inc. and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 5% to their target.

# Valuation

The free cashflow yield is nice, even if the PE ratio is pricey. And the dividends are coming...though there's no reason I can see to pick Reynolds over Altria or Philip Morris. 

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/rai/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|

# Dividends
Reynolds American, Inc. is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.69 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $1.48 per share. That is a 14% growth. The forecast dividend of $1.69 compares to a forecast EPS of $2.35.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 8% that compares with no change in the earnings forecasts.

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/rai/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers.

&gt; Over time, we would expect cigarette volume declines to return to their historical range of down 2% to 4%. However, we continue to expect the positive macro trends will benefit the cigarette industry throughout 2016, and our current view continues to be that cigarette volumes will be down closer to the 2% end of the range for the full year.

So, the business isn't about to get killed anytime soon, even if it started to decline at 4% a year. And with consolidation they are able to squeeze out greater profits. Plus there may be some international rabbit they can pull out of the hat.

So, for now, it's not smokin' but it ain't smoked either.

I started seriously mulling it over in my head. How do student loan securities work? Borrowers can't default on the loans, and lenders have the right to garnish wages. So how can the risk be assessed as anything but low? And I know there are tranches, so some of them are assessed as low -- but weirdly, the high rated loans tend to be the ones that are goign to be paid off the fastest. Shouldn't those be rated low, if you're not going to accrue interest? 

Additionally, Obama passed that thing that says loans will be forgiven after 20 years. Those loans wouldn't be defaulting, just forgiven? How does that work? Could you buy credit default swaps on student loan bonds and have them paid out by the government when they are forgiven?

Maybe I have this all mixed up, but any help would be great! Having access to Moody's, S&amp;P, and business source complete, I'm doing my own research (which is thus far, coming up blank). And I will post anything interesting I find here. 

Thank you!",2

16-07-25,4ul9s3,Question about what kind of sell order(s) I should use.,"I wanted to know if a certain kind of sell order existed for shares of a stock. Lets say I own 100 shares of AAPL and think that it is going to spike massively and then go back down. Is there any way to set a sell order based off a percentage of the stocks highest point since the order was placed? I know this sounds kind of weird and confusing but ill do my best to simplify:

(this is just an example, please no one take this as me saying appl is going to spike to 200. Ok anyways....)

- I own 100 shares of aapl. I bought them at $100
- I think the price is going to spike to $200 so I want to place a sell order there.
- I also want to place another sell order to protect myself incase it does not quite hit 200.
- I want the 2nd sell order to trigger @ market price if the price falls 10%

For example: 

- If it fell right after i placed the orders, I would end up selling @ $90
- If it only rose up to 160 then started falling until it hit 10% down from 160, my sell order would trigger @ $144

Basically, is there a way for me to make a percentage or adaptive sell order, the only way for me to actually do that would be to sit and manually watch the price all day, and sell it myself if it falls 10%.",1

16-07-25,4ulbw9,STMP a potential winner for Thursday earnings play after the close,"STMP caught my attention last week after the earnings report posted by /u/SherJava and commented on by /u/thedudeabidezzzz. Increased volume into earnings with a 10% bump last Friday and volume is surging daily, and as of today (7/25) volume is way above the 90-day average at almost 2x. Because of the bump upwards in pricing and volume last Friday with little-to-no-news I’m willing to bet there is at least one fund that is going long this bad-boy into the earnings call, especially with the positive momentum continuing into today's trading session.

So what the fuck is going on with $STMP for it to fall from $120 in March to $70 last week, wiping out all the pre-mature ejaculators here in WSB that may have gotten involved early? The Capital Forum cited increased regulatory risk on 7/8, and a follow-on short attack by short-selling prescience point on both their own website and publicized on seeking alpha kept the stock down ([LINK TO PDF] (http://www.presciencepoint.com/reports/PresciencePoint_STMP_Report_7-16-2016.pdf)) while the sell-side came to the company’s aid shortly thereafter. I am really excited because I find this attack lacking.

The attack basically states that someone else said the USPS postage reseller program is being abused by STMP. A quote is below:

“We believe that Stamps.com has partnered with certain Utah-based postage resellers as part of a scheme to characterize low-volume shipping customers that should not qualify for USPS discounts as high-volume shipping customers. In doing so, it seems that Stamps.com has found a way to skim undeserved revenues at the expense of the USPS. We suspect that Stamps.com, using postage reseller discounts, is part of a larger scheme to buy USPS postage at discounted rates intended for only high-volume shippers, and then resell that postage to customers at the standard marked up rate, effectively capturing an ‘arb spread’.” (Page 9)

I guess that sucks if it's true, but frankly I don't care. The company is going to come out with a rebuttal in some way on Thursday, and I'm compelled to believe that it's going to be enough to give a bump to the stock.  Why? The business school and analyst stuff:

Balance sheet is quite clean - $119mn in cash, $160mn in debt, trailing adjusted EBITDA according to Bloomberg is $82mn for a debt/EBITDA ratio of 1.9x. I look at anything in the 4x+ range to be worrisome, so I’m comfortable with their debt. To go one step further – the debt matures in 2020 and has a 3% yield according to Bloomberg. No one thinks this thing is going to default (I would check covenants but this is a reddit write-up so do it yourself). Further, the Net-debt-to-EBITDA metric is $41mn net debt/$82mn in EBITDA = 0.5X ND/EBITDA. Credit risk is negligent. HFL had a default risk, which is why Ackman believed the name could genuinely go to $0.00.

It’s at 19.7x P/E, in line with the average since 2009, and at a 5.4% free cash flow yield (below the 4.4% average yield since 2009). This is not a cheap value play that we’re dealing with, but a growth stock. It’s worth noting that they spent $55mn on an acquisition in the last quarter and generated $75mn in FCF over the LTM. Again, I’m not concerned about the cash position or default, and I’m ok with the growth coming in through acquisition.

Why am I really excited here? The PEG ratio and forward earnings expectations. Excluding a 25% dip in earnings in 2014 the PEG ratio (P/E divided by PEG as an absolute number, which isn't useful for those with declining earnings) has averaged at 0.4x. Despite this, today the PEG at 0.23x for next year. This lower-than-average number means that given the anticipated earnings growth the company is valued at a lower than historical multiple (like half the historical multiple given the growth). That’s right you autistic piece of shit – this thing is undervalued.

As for another way to take this idea to heart look at how earning expectations have developed for 2016 in this chart, when compared with the price:  [imgur](http://imgur.com/MowVzvm)

This is the estimated consensus estimate for 2016 against $STMP’s current price in the market. You’ll notice that at the time late last year earnings for 2016 (the green line) were expected to be ~$3.85/share while the stock traded around $75. Today, 7/25/16, the stock trades around the same price (~$80 today) yet earnings for the year are expected to be just under $6/share! The short attack obviously had an impact on valuation because if you look at where earnings are expected to be this stock should be trading higher, but remember that there’s no way the thesis will be confirmed on the upcoming earnings call so there’s little risk this stock gets obliterated there. Remember how low $HLF took to play out, and how little it was hurt in the end? Even he-who-may-not-be-named might agree that this pricing makes little sense, and anyone short this thing into earnings because they’re expecting a business shut-down is a moron.

The short-sellers just won with the recent tumble in price, and it’s time to take the other side of the trade and let the pendulum swing back towards normalization. So I’m long, and I don’t give a fuck if what they are doing is illegal or not, or may eventually face scrutiny. This is a get-in-get-out trade, as the company will meet its earnings expectations (or beat, who knows), reaffirm faith from wall street, and get a nice pop for all of us to cash out on.

16-07-26,4uoxm4,"I've been long YHOO for a year. I just increased my position by 400%. Here's why.","Sum of the parts math has looked amazing for a long time. You have the stake in Alibaba, the stake in Yahoo Japan, you have the cash, you have the patents, and you have the festering pile of monkey shit that is the core business, which the market was valuing at less than $0.

The market undervalued all of that by 30%+. 

The thesis was that the day of reckoning would come and that value would have to be unlocked. The bear thesis was that management was incompetent and would squander those assets. 

Well they finally sold the core business. Once that closes, all that will be left of YHOO is stock in two other companies, some patents and a bunch of cash. If that's not the day of reckoning, we're very close to it. And the stock hasn't moved on news of the sale. It's just fluttering around with the price of BABA as it always does.

Here is what the sum of the parts math looks like today:

* $31.9 bn 	BABA
* $9 bn	Yahoo Japan
* $1 bn	patents
* $6 bn	cash
* $4.8 bn	core sale

Total: $52.8 bn
YHOO Market Cap: $35.8 bn

I listed patents at $1bn, reports are that they will get higher, possibly as much as $3 billion. 

The $52.8 figure still has to be reduced for unknown tax liabilities on divesting the BABA and Yahoo Japan stakes as well as the sale of the core business. But the taxes are obviously not going to be $17 billion. The difference between whatever the taxes are and $17 billion is free money. And that free money will be coming soon. Whenever and however they decide to divest all of this stuff, that money is coming back to papa shareholder. ",9

[Data was compiled from this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/4ugqwk/earningsplay_survey_for_monday_pm_tuesday_am/)

We had 150+ people vote and I've gathered a few quick stats:

1: WSB is mostly wrong... out of 20 plays, WSB guessed correct on 8 of them. Not only that but 3 of those 8 started or ended the day opposite of what WSB guessed. I'm going to assume you're not completely retarded and would sell your option when you're up so I counted those as correct instead of wrong. 

2: The more confident WSB is about their guess, the more likely they are to be wrong! M3,  Electronics for Imaging, Gilead, Under Armour, and Mcdonalds all had &gt;75% of people supporting one trend, and it turns out they were wrong. Some other confident guesses that were correct were Express Scripts, Caterpillar, and Canadian National Railway but didn't have as heavy of influence.

No matter who wins between trump and clinton, theres going to be a shit storm. Maybe not on election, but id say 6 months before or 6 months after, you may see some shit.

So in that next year, with the world economy already slowing, when you weigh the risk:reward, youre looking at a maybe 5% gain above current highs and an expectance of a minimum of a 10% correction. So to me the reward isnt very good.

16-07-27,4ury13,"I went long Tsla on Thursday, it takes up 7.5% of my diversified portfolio. Thoughts?","Background: I have a diversified portfolio of 17 stocks that last week I put approx 7.5% of the portfolio in Tesla. This makes it my second largest position.  This is an account that I consider aggressive and I'm seeking appreciation /growth over the long term. I'm not looking to trade Tsla but invest in it. 

Note: This account is NOT my 401k, but is an inherited IRA that is about the same value as my 401k (my 401k is technically the TSP and is invested in 40% each C and S and 20% I).

So the question: how risky is my Tesla move?  

I've tried to evaluate it and here are my thoughts:



* long term improvements in revenue as operating costs will likely fall as production increases and in turn increases efficiencies


* professional analyst models shows economic profit starting in 2018


* value today looks to be based on what Tesla is expected to achieve in the next decade (and the company may be overvalued today).  That is okay, but it means the company has to hit vehicle targets through 2025 or beyond.


* solar city purchase will drain cash, but is a short term distraction


* future R&amp;D and scalability will likely have to occur during (or after) future economic downturns and means the company will suffer if it can't get funds in a recession


* until the model 3 goes on sale in 2017 (assuming there are not timeline delays) we won't know for sure if consumers will actually switch to EVs


* uncertain what will happen to value if vehicle demand exceeds capacity 


* expectations by average investors (and the street) are immense, so even minor growth stalls and stumbles can lead to a major decline in value


* German competitors are coming into the EV market (future risk and merger/takeover possibility)


* Stock price is heavily linked to one man's actions (Musk)


* every professional analysis I read tells me to sell, which is why this is possibly a contrarian play and could mean huge upside


I have more but am typing on a phone so will cut this short. Am I crazy/reckless/blind?

Analysts Avg. Estimate: .81
Low Estimate: .68
High Estimate: .90

My take:

I work for a small digital media firm working on mostly SEO and Analytics. For some of our larger clients we've tested budgets across FB and INSTA ads and in tje past 6 months we've seen some very solid returns. 

There is the argument that although the paid social industry is growing, competitors like SnapChat, Twitter, Pinterest etc... Are taking market share away from FB, but I don't buy it. FB is entirley its own platform and with the value of live video, Instagram and Oculus etc... It will continue to grow.

Now I 100% understand that preferred shares don't have nearly the chance of growth as normal stocks, but they also seem to have higher dividends, less chance of being affected by the market either way, and I have a LONG time horizon for holding.

So here's where I'm at: I've got a good deal of my money sitting in an Ally bank account that I'm receiving some serious cash drag on w/ 1% interest. If I find a company (I quite like the histories of the mREIT/REITs I've seen) that's been around for a while and pays a solid dividend, why wouldn't I take the money sitting in my (non-emergency fund) Ally account and dump it into several preferred stocks, turning DRIP on for my investments, and letting my money make money for me?",4

I'm fairly new to investing but I've been reading non stop about the matter but a few months ago I purchased a few APPL shares primary for the dividend income. Even though it's Apple, I still stuck to the basics and did all the financial research on Apple because I feel like that's a good habit to maintain. My question is, is it a sound a investment to keep purchasing Apple solely for the dividend payments and as a long time hold? I feel like it is but since I'm still a newbie, I'd figure I'd get a second opinion. 

Thank you for any information! ",0

# Description
NetSuite Inc is a provider of cloud-based financials, enterprise resource planning and omnichannel commerce software suites. The Company offers a suite of applications, including financial management, customer relationship management, e-commerce and retail management, commerce marketing automation, professional services automation and human capital management that enable companies to manage business operations in an integrated suite. 

## Recent financials 

Despite the stellar growth in sales, the profitability has yet to come through. 

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $0.7bn | $0.6bn | $0.4bn | $0.3bn | $0.2bn|
|EPS | -$1.59 | -$1.31 | -$0.95 | -$0.50 | -$0.48|
## Competition

&gt; We compete with a broad array of financials/ERP, CRM, ecommerce, PSA and HCM companies. Our markets are highly competitive, fragmented and subject to rapid changes in technology. Many of our potential customers evaluate a wide range of alternatives during their purchase process. Our current principal competitors include Epicor Software Corporation, Intuit Inc., Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, SAP AG, The Sage Group plc, salesforce.com, inc. and Workday, Inc.

Given they lose money it's hard to compare them. Their competitor Workday isn't is a dissimilar place! Though obviously if they can get to the scale of the majors, the cashflow would be lovely :)

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
NetSuite Inc | $793M | -ve | -ve
salesforce.com, inc. | $7,073M | 11% | N/A
Workday Inc | $1,257M | -ve | -ve
Intuit Inc. | $4,458M | 33% | 51%
Oracle Corporation | $37,047M | 42% | 19%
Microsoft Corporation | $85,320M | 33% | 22%
SAP SE (ADR) | $23,390M | 32% | 16%

For a comparison to Workday's sales. Rather a more exciting growth rate, eh?

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $1.2bn | $0.8bn | $0.5bn | $0.3bn | $0.1bn|


## Cash / Debt?
NetSuite Inc has $99M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 1% of the market value of NetSuite Inc. So nothing to see there.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $85.04 for NetSuite Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Hold_. That implies an upside of 1% to their target.

# Valuation

With the business turning positive this year, the PE valuation is rather insane. And with earnings expected to rise 80% in the 2017 year... the valuation will continue to be high!

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/n/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
N | $6,750M | 185x | 40% | 0% | -ve
WDAY.K | $15,780M | N/A | 33% | 0% | -ve
SAP | $104,918M | 20x | 11% | 2% | 7%
INTU.O | $29,072M | 31x | 20% | 1% | 5%
ORCL.K | $168,785M | 15x | 8% | 1% | 8%
MSFT.O | $446,160M | 20x | 9% | 3% | 8%
CRM | $55,392M | 86x | 29% | 0% | 1%

# Dividends
NetSuite Inc is not forecast to pay a dividend this year.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 8% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 5%. That's against a backdrop of sales up 31%!

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/n/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers.

&gt; For the full-year this year, we're going to revise our revenue range upward from our previous outlook of $950 million to $970 million to a new range of $955 million to $975 million. We believe the leverage that we are seeing in our operations will both allow us to increase some investments in capacities for the remainder of this year and expand net margin slightly as well. So were raising our EPS guidance for the year from the previous range of $0.40 to $0.45 to a new range of $0.42 to $0.47. 

I can't see why I'd stick round hoping Oracle bought the business... Sure Ellison owns over 40% of the company. But does it make sense to buy it when the profitability is at these levels?

Sure the SaaS model is the future of software. But hasn't that been the case for 10 years now?

16-07-26,4uqh8y,"$NTDOY, Nintendo, PokemonGo, NX","**Early Analysis**

Looking at the very attractive prospect of getting into Nintendo for a long term hold. Few reasons. 

- PokemonGo put the spotlight onto Nintendo, even though it had near nothing to do with the craze. 
- The Nintendo NX, an upcoming system from Nintendo, looks like it is going to be moving back to what nintendo is really good at, **HANDHELDS**. 

**NX**

The NX is looking to be a dual home console/gameboy like system. Being able to be attached to a TV at home, but also be a system which you can travel with. One of the more interesting games to come with this system is the new Zelda game, usually always a fan favorite, and the game looks outstanding, could be a huge drawing factor for the game. 

My only concern is that there appears to be a push for cartridges for the console. I am unsure as to how I feel about this, as I feel like the world has moved beyond the need for physical games *nearly*. 

**Analysis**

I don't believe there is a whole lot to really consider with the Nintendo right now. I believe the Wii/WiiU and the DS series created a divergence in the company. Yes, multiple products do attract different audiences, but if there is something that the iPhone has taught us is that being able to be everything in one is much more beneficial. 

I do believe they had many of the aspects right with their recent slew of systems, but they were all in competing systems, not complete. If the NX is what I think it is, and it shows to be a complete system, we could be looking at another blockbuster, like the first Nintendo DS and Wii. 

**Buy In Price**

I am looking to get into Nintendo around the $25-26 price range, and hope to hold for at least a year, pickup some dividends and try to pick the high point to exit out again. 

The Wii and DS were released just before the spike began to rise in mid 2006, which pushed the price from sub $20, to just below $80.

Gamescon, I expect the console to be released around that time (17th-21st September). So I hope to get in before then.

 I am also going to be looking at options for NTDOY to play for that weekend. It seems Nintendo stock is very up and down on good news, so might be a good play.",0

16-07-27,4uswcu,State Retirement MURDERING my money?,"I've been working for the State of NC for 4 years next month and for the first time I've taken a look at my retirement accounts. I only did this because I am working with my wife on the Financial Peace University (Dave Ramsey) through our church and I've been inspired to look closer at investments.

&amp;nbsp;

Well I was appalled to find that although I've made an average of $1900/yr investment (mandatory 6% as condition of employment, cannot raise or lower %s) that the treasury department is only averaging a 3.8% ROI over that last 4 years.... that is half of what I feel I could do with a simple portfolio of Vanguard ETFs.

&amp;nbsp;

I haven't been able to check out my Wife's 401k through Carolinas Healthcare Systems but I doubt she's doing much better.

&amp;nbsp;

If my 6% is mandatory am I getting screwed as bad as I think I am? I am half wondering if I should change careers for the purpose of improving my retirement ability? I mean at this point the only benefit I am getting with staying with the State is that my Healthcare in retirement is going to be 90% paid for as long as I do my 30 years. I can already see that my income from retirement will only average $33,000/yr without finding was to do a lot more on the Post-Tax side....

**TL;DR: Is the state pension fund payout of $33,000/yr after 30 years worth the 6% investment or should I consider changing careers so that I might invest that 6% on my own in order to earn more in retirement?**",0

There is a lot of animosity on what their earnings will look like tomorrow. Lets say, for instance, that at our game tonight, I where to hypothetically, ask him if it would be in my best interest to go and buy green apples as apposed to red apples for my snack at 4:30pm tomorrow. Maybe I throw a wink at him, who knows. 

Lets say all goes as planned and he tells me where to get the freshest Granny Smith's in town. I end up enjoying my apple at 9:30am because it looked so delicious, I just couldn't wait any longer! While I'm munching on my apple, I think about my new earned trust on my beer league teammate. This causes me to really believe in him as a person and the  company he works for as a whole. So I decide to take out small loan and deploy it as well as my savings into call options on his company.

I have been saving for the last several years and currently have $95k in the bank earning 0.10% interest, which is earning about $100 a year, and I am tired of it. I have no debt and in about a year, a good part of that money is going going towards a house/mortgage and the rest for the expenses that come with it. So I have a year to try and make as much as I can, without risking too much. 

My original plan was to purchase 40,000 shares of AMD (back when it was going for $2 a share. If I did that, and sold it at the current price, I would have made about $200,000 or so profit... (angry with myself for not doing it). But now the price per share is almost $7 and I could only purchase around 15,000 shares. Should I still proceed or consider other options? I still have confidence in AMD and the Zen and Vega products boosting the share value in Q1/Q2 2017, but with the price already at $7, I have doubts.

Any thoughts/suggestions would be appreciated. ",0

Even at 5%, that's only an extra 25k a year. IF you have half a million in savings, I'm gonna assume you have a marketable skill that is fairly valuable, and thus you could probably make an extra $25k (risk free) if you instead just devoted your stock analysis time to additional billable hours / overtime / side business in your field of expertise.

Notes: Strong results, Novavax looking to gain a fast track approval before continuing.

**(6)** Pandemic Vaccine (H7N9 Influenza) - Currently in Phase 2, awarded $186.7 Million grant from US Health and Human Services Granted FDA Fast track

**(7)** Ebola GP Vaccine - Completed Phase 1, positive results.

**(8)** MERS Vaccine - Pre-clinical work showed proof of concept within lab.

**(9)** Zika - Preliminary work being done.

**Why Novavax?**
Currently no other company has a vaccine in the works for RSV with the exception of GlaxoSmith Kline, whose candidate is years behind (currently in Phase 2). RSV in also the leading cause of infant hospitalizations in America, and worldwide it is only second to Malaria as the leading cause of infant deaths. It also is a vaccine that will be in high demand as the economic burden of RSV is very large, costing about $88 Billion dollars annually worldwide. A study from the United Kingdom found that the burden of RSV was larger than the burden of Influenza in the UK in every year since 1995 with the exception of 1998.

*Estimated Price per Share*
According to Marketwatch, 7 analysts rate it a buy, and 1 analysts rates it a hold. Average Price target works out to be $13.68.
What I expect

**Short Term:** I see a quick jump to $8.30, a sudden reversal from from the last few days of last week which has left this stock underweighted.

**Long Term:** I see the Phase 3 results that are due by September 30th being positive, and we'll see a quick jump to $13-$15. Soon after I expect a partnership with an overseas pharmaceutical, particularly focused on selling the vaccines overseas. 

Once approved by the FDA in 2017, I expect a quick launch and maybe, just maybe a buyout.
The real gem of this company so far are the RSV vaccines which are wholly unique. Soon, I hope these vaccines will be overshadowed with continued work and development of the Combination Vaccine, which would be the first ever dual vaccine technology.

**One last tidbit:** This company is 84% owned by institutions and insiders. The company has just leased out a much larger building, and are looking to hire hundreds of new employees. So many in fact Maryland's state governor visited the facilities there last week. But spending money on larger spaces and more people seems like an excellent sign for me! Full Disclosure: I do own NVAX stock.

16-07-27,4uxody,Long-Term Short on Automotive?,"I believe many automotive stocks are going to be in pain within 5 years -- 


Self Driving will trim the market down to a few companies -- perhaps Google (and it's partners) and Tesla win out.


But even before then, a recession would tank auto sales -- subprime auto loans are at a high, and a recession would kill that market, would probably drop the value of used cars, and make new cars less appealing.


What should I go about doing to bet on this?


I could short some stocks -- GM, Chrysler, maybe Ford.  Maybe Toyota.


Downside: I might have to hold the short for a long time, probably pay high stock loan fees (given I'm an individual), and could end up losing alot of money if I'm wrong.



Put Leaps -- expensive, but if I'm right I can make alot, but they have a high cost -- especially if I'm 5 years away from being right; or if I'm completely wrong.  Upside is my exposure is limited


Anyone agree with me that either a recession or innovation can destroy many existing auto companies; and if so, how would you, or how are you, placing bets?

--------------------------------------------------------------

Apple Inc. $AAPL-


said its quarterly profit fell 27%. Revenue fell for a second straight quarter, along with sales of its flagship smartphone.


While the company reported strong sales of the smaller iPhone SE launched in March, overall its current models have failed to meet the booming sales of its first batch of large-screen iPhones, sapped in part by cooling demand in China and U.S. customers holding on to handsets for longer because of changes in carrier contracts.


The results, and Apple’s expectations for the current quarter ending September, were better than what Wall Street feared, and the stock rose more than 6% in after-hours trading. 


A bright spot was Apple’s revenue for services, including subscriptions to Apple Music, fees from Apple Pay and sales of apps. The company said services revenue rose 19% to $5.98 billion.
While iPad revenue increased 7% because of its pricier iPad Pro, unit sales fell for a 10th-straight quarter, down 9% to 9.95 million.
Sales of Mac computers fell 11%, marking a third-straight quarter of decline.

Apple shipped: 

-40.4M iPhones

-10M iPads 

-4.3M Macs 

-gave strong guidance for FQ4

-Tim Cook also expects services to be ""the size of a Fortune 100 company by next year,"" with major growth in the App Store, Apple Music and the iCloud.

-------------------------------------------------------------------


Twitter inc. $TWTR - 


fell short of expectations with a $107 million net loss on $602 million in sales. At a 20% gain year-over-year, this is Twitter’s slowest quarter of revenue growth since it went public. Shares dropped by 10% in after-hours trading. Investors were forecasting $682 million in sales for the third quarter.


Twitter's user base increased about 1 percent to 313 million average monthly active users in the second quarter from 310 million in the first quarter.


Earlier this year, Twitter laid out a long-term strategy to turn around its business, focusing on five areas: its core service, live-streaming video, the site's ""creators and influencers,"" safety and developers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------


The Coca-Cola Co. $KO -


released its Q2 earnings results on Wednesday morning. Revenues came in below Wall Street consensus expectations. 


Coke said it earned 60 cents a share, outpacing analysts' estimates of 58 cents a share, but revenue fell 5 percent, coming in at $11.54 billion in the latest quarter, shy of Wall Street's expectations, which called for $11.6 billion, on average. Second-quarter sales fell in each of Coke's regional units, except in North America.


Coca-Cola, PepsiCo Inc. and Dr Pepper Snapple Group have faced declining sales volumes as consumers turn to healthier alternatives. To combat the long-term decline in soda consumption, Coca-Cola has broadened its portfolio of products. The company took a stake in L.A. Aloe LLC, an aloe water-maker, last month. It also invested in Suja Life LLC, an organic-juice maker, in August, with an option to buy the balance of the company after three years. Coca-Cola previously bought a stake in energy-drink maker Monster Beverage Corp. and Keurig Green Mountain Inc.


-Some governments are turning against soda, too. Last month,Philadelphia became the first major U.S. city to pass a tax on diet and sugar-added beverages. 

-The United Kingdom is introducing a sugar tax in 2018.

-Coca-Cola has spent almost $50m in the last four years on research to develop new lower and no sugar drinks.

----------------------------------------------------------------


Comcast Corporation. $CMCSA-


second quarter was stronger than Wall Street had expected as the company narrowed the loss of video subscribers and revenue took off. For the period ended June 30, Comcast Corp. earned $2.03 billion, or 83 cents per share. A year earlier the Philadelphia company earned $2.14 billion, or 84 cents per share.


Comcast lost 4,000 video customers, which was the best second-quarter number in more than a decade, according to the company. 

At the same time, the company booked an increase in residential high-speed internet customers and small business customers. It added 220,000 high-speed internet customers in the period, the best performance for the quarter in eight years.


-------------------------------------------------------------------


T- Mobile US. $TMUS -


T-Mobile on Wednesday said Q2 revenue rose nearly 13% to $9.2 billion as it added 646,000 postpaid phone subscribers -- topping the 173,000 added by Sprint (S) and the 86,000 added by Verizon Communications (VZ). AT&amp;T lost 160,000 postpaid phone subscribers.


T-Mobile reported earnings of 25 cents per share vs what Wall Street was looking for 20 cents per share. 
Revenue of $9.22 billion for the period, beating estimates of $9.03 billion. In the second quarter T-Mobile added 1.9 million net new customers.

It accomplished this feat by giving away company stock, movies, car rides and pizza. To help it compete against wireless behemoths AT&amp;T and VerizonWireless, T-Mobile forged partnerships with ride-hailing service Lyft and Domino’s Pizza to woo potential new customers with vouchers for free rides and free pizza. The company also promoted giveaways of T-Mobile stock.

T-Mobile raised its year outlook for adding branded postpaid customers to a range of 3.4 million to 3.8 million, up from the prior range of 3.2 million to 3.6 million.

It now sees Ebitda of $9.8 billion to $10.1 billion, a narrowing of the prior range of $9.7 billion to $10.2 billion.

16-07-28,4v1tkp,Retiring at 39 with $15 million,"I worked like a dog for the past 15 years and built my business from scratch. I received an offer from a competitor to purchase it, and after a bit of a bidding war with two other parties, a deal was made. When the sale closes and all is said and done, I will walk away with $11 million after tax. Couple this with ~$4 million I already have ($2 million house and $2 million in cash), and I will have a net worth of $15 million, of which $13 million will be liquid.

I have a wife and two small kids. We have a pretty high maintenance lifestyle (new $100 - $200k cars every couple years), private school for both kids ($40k each), vacations, clothes, maid, charities, helping out family, etc...add it all up and we spend about $40,000 a month right now.

I sold my business because it consumed me and I wanted to step back and smell the roses. I don't want to get involved in any other business and just want passive income. Now that the deal is done, I feel scared because I have no active income coming in anymore.

I've only invested once in stocks, and I lost pretty much everything. I've recently been reading about the markets, and what I concluded was to stick all the ""risky"" money in low cost ETF's, like an S&amp;P 500 ETF and put the rest in bonds. Basically, investing in stocks or hedge or mutual funds is a suckers game and one typically lags the market.

I have gotten professional advice from bankers and such, but they all basically say to let them manage the money, and I'm leery of that. 

I basically want to get at least $40k of monthly after tax income off of the $13 million to be invested without taking too much risk.

I don't know why I'm posting here, maybe it's just to hear unbiased opinions or maybe it's just to get this off my chest. Believe it or not, it's a very stressful time and knowing that I have no income to rely on scares me. I don't want to spend the principal because I'm scared of running out of money when we're old, and I also want to leave a lot to our kids.

Update: 
I'm really glad to receive so much advice and commentary. I've actually read each and every comment and I'll try to reply to as many as I can within the next 20 minutes as that's all the time I have today.",455

16-07-27,4uuphu,GPRO Reports 2Q Earnings After Close Today,"Anyone have any thoughts going into their earnings report?

There are significant headwinds and a high chance of failure for GPRO in my opinion. Their upcoming product offering this winter (drone and new camera) will be key to their success. If they do well, GPRO will be a decent company that can live in its niche. Max value I think will be about $20/share with a P/E of 15. If the products fail then that's the end of GPRO in my opinion.

As of their last 10Q GPRO still had $600M in current assets while only $213M in current debt. Also only $36M in long term debt. They have a healthy balance sheet that can float them for another quarter or two, but must return to profitability by the end of the year.

For this earnings, I'm looking for a small loss per share. Something better than (0.25)/share would be great and a huge beat compared to expectations. Short term (3 month) price target of $15. Look for information in their press release and on their call about their fall/winter lineup.

Using Finviz, I stumbled onto Ciber Inc.. It seemed interesting enough, IT which is what I'm in, small cap, and a low low price per stock. 
I downloaded their 10-k, previous 5 10-q, website search, google search, and took plenty of notes. Unfortunately /r/investing did not have anything on CBR so that is why I'm here. 

Q2 earnings is being posted on August 4th.
Their vendor partners are SAP (CBR's CEO is on the board for SAP), Microsoft, Infor, and Oracle

Pros:

* converting legacy applications to cloud software as a service.
* Service based, no hardware, and Employees spend significant amount of time at client facilities, reducing office space need
* Their are actively hiring employees at a new location in orlando


Cons:

* I DON'T like the fact that they outsource some operations outside the US.
* Involved in litigation with the PTC (Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission)
* Third ranking official resigned in June (Been with them for 2 years)

Does anyone else thing Ciber was down on its luck in the market place and will post earnings in Q2? And since the trend seems to be ~23% decrease per quarter posted with loss earnings would and upward trend even be expected?

What do they do: Produce extended release and abuse deterrent drugs. 

Why I'm telling you: Upcoming catalysts could send this to the moon of no drug addicts.

What catalyst: An advisory committee meeting for their extended release drug ARYMO is on August 4th (briefing notes will most likely be released on Jul. 29 or the first), if positive will cause a nice run up to the PDUFA date on October 14th. Which will more than likely also have a pretty good impact. 

What else: [Pipeline](http://i.imgur.com/yxBkQnD.jpg) looks legit if you're looking to hold a little longer. Also something that worries me is the director announced he has 0 ownership of the company now. So take that what you will.

Motley Fool Stock Advisor...SHOP

Those of you who have boxes of online purchases piling up on your doorsteps may be surprised to hear that e-commerce accounted for only 7.8% of total U.S. retail sales in the first quarter of 2016, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. But online sales growth is in the high teens year over year, even as the overall market increases. My team's recommendation this month, e-commerce platform provider Shopify  (NYSE: SHOP), allows merchants to capitalize on this trend by providing a one-stop shop for all aspects of a business's commerce operations — desktop, mobile, and social media storefronts, and even physical retail transactions — all for a low monthly fee. And it's been so successful that Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) bowed out of a similar line of business and instead formed a relationship with Shopify.

From Snowboards to SaaS

Shopify was founded by snowboarder and programmer Tobias Lütke in 2004, when Lütke and a friend were trying to start an online business to sell high-end snowboards. But Lütke found that the available e-commerce software was useless, so he built his own. From that new software platform (with roots in an obscure Japanese programming language), Lütke created Shopify, which turned out to be a much better business than selling snowboards. He still owns more than 10% of common shares outstanding, aligning his interests with ours as shareholders.

Today, Shopify provides the e-commerce backbone to 275,000 stores, fortified by more than 1,000 mostly third-party apps that let store managers customize the online experience they want their shoppers to have. It's an extremely flexible cloud-based platform, for which Shopify charges monthly subscription fees ranging from $9 to $299, plus a cut of the transactions. Shopify links social media to mobile and physical stores to provide a multichannel integrated solution.

Small businesses are Shopify's bread and butter, but the company also counts global brands like Google parent Alphabet  (NASDAQ: GOOG), Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA), and the L.A. Lakers among its clients through its Shopify Plus product (which runs up to $5,000 per month). Shopify CFO Norman Jones estimates the total addressable market to be even larger, at 46 million companies.

Shredding the Market

The adaptability of Shopify's software solutions has powered the company's explosive growth. Gross merchandise volume has increased from $1.6 billion (with 84,000 merchants) in 2013 to $3.8 billion (with 144,700 merchants) in 2014 to $7.7 billion (with 243,500 merchants) in 2015. If Shopify achieves the low end of management's full-year 2016 revenue guidance of $337 million, it will ring up a whopping 94% four-year CAGR.

Although Shopify is generating a net loss, its $190 million in cash, no debt, and positive operating cash flow suggest that it's off to a great start. With a nearly 79% gross margin on its subscriptions revenue and about 25% gross margin (although highly variable) in Merchant Solutions — payments, shipping, and more — Shopify delivers positive operating cash flow with low capital needs. And we expect it to become more profitable as it grows. After all, the company will be able to spread its marketing and development costs across a larger group of customers. Rapid sales growth paired with margin improvement — a combo we love — has potential to catapult earnings and the stock price. 

Risks and When We'd Sell

Anytime a new venture meets with success, competitors appear overnight. Shopify is no different, with BigCommerce, Woo, Wix, and others trying to elbow in on the fast-growing e-commerce market. But Shopify's products seem to win out, with rave reviews and consistent No. 1 ratings. The company's ability to attract merchants, keep its subscribers, and incrementally increase its relationships with its customers are key here, so if retention or Shopify's strong standing eroded, we might look elsewhere.

The market's valuation of Shopify bakes in high expectations for growth, and because the company is not yet profitable, this means investors need to be ready for a bumpy ride. With its leading position in a huge and growing industry, Shopify seems well able to continue meeting high expectations, but if any of its key metrics faltered, we'd consider emptying our carts.

Finally, as with any software company that processes payments, potential security breaches pose a huge risk. If a software glitch or malicious attack disrupted business for Shopify's customers, they could leave the service or be hurt badly enough to be unable to stay in business. Shopify works hard to stay ahead of hackers and other security threats, but if the worst happens, we'd want to think carefully about whether to check out.

The Foolish Bottom Line

Shopify's business has been nearly doubling or more than doubling each year for the past few years, and with millions of merchants out there looking for better ways to manage their online business, the market opportunity is huge. With its founder-led culture, innovative and flexible product line, and market leadership, Shopify offers investors great potential bang for their buck.

The IPO recently debuted with a slight bang but has seen mostly declining stock prices since. They aren't doing too much that differs from its competitors except selling in app purchases. I do think being a regional player in Asia it could expand but only because of something like privacy concerns from wechat. I also think if they can pivot to become a more business centric platform catering to medium to large businesses Line could see some strong penetration in that sector for secure messaging. Overall I think it could be a long shot and I don't know if I see the stock price going much higher than $40 at this point. ",1

16-07-28,4v34n7,First Solar Earnings DD (FSLR),"The only solar company in the black has Earnings August 3rd AH at 4:30PM

Here's what I have so far

**Insiders**
Close to 1,000,000 shares given in July 21 to high ranking officials. All apart of a Performance Plan that rewards Directors and officers for meeting corporate targets/goals

**Historical Past Earnings**
FSLR is the only solar company that is doing ""well"" financially wise. They have $1.8B on hand with a long term governmet loan of about $250M. They have also beat their last 5 out of their last 6 earnings

**Market Reactions**
(Quater, Met status, % pps change)

* Q4 2014 Met +2.6%
* Q1 2015 Missed -3.6%
* Q2 2015 Met     +13%
* Q3 2015 Met     +12%
* Q4 2015 Met     +4%
* Q1 2016 Met     -5%

Something to note about Q1 2016 and Q4 2015 is that the whole solar industry itself was down. As of today every solar company besides FSLR is in the red including Solar City. Ironically SUN bankruptcy rumors were highest a 3-4 days before FSLR's earnings. Every Solar stock dropped with FSLR being the least affected at 4.3%.  It also didnt help that they missed the top line by 13%.

**Financials**
Credits to /u/Stick_Stickly1

https://gyazo.com/42e1e101f7952c59d30b69d694188ca9
""If I were to invest in a solar company, FSLR would be the one I would invest in.
Positives
 It is one of the very few companies in the industry that has a positive net cash position, 3.6% of net sales goes into R&amp;D which isn't too bad, growth isn't too aggressive or slow, the rest of the positives are included in the picture
Negatives 
There has been an earnings deficit within the past 10 years and it doesn't pay a dividend. Its also not trading near the grahams enterprising stock number but is trading under the book value.""

**Governments role**
FSLR is 30% owned by the Waltons (walmart) who also has the government by the balls
Government enforced tarrifs against china solar has made it lucrative for FSLR to operate with businesses getting essentially 30% off. But this is set to drop later next year so I assume FLSR has received an influx of orders for this year.

**Red Flags**
Some things to note

* SUN has again created solar instability by filing for bankruptcy late april. Though this is hopeful.
https://www.greenbiz.com/article/why-sunedisons-bankruptcy-wont-deflate-solar-boom

* Their CEO is James Hughes, former President and CEO of Enron

* The cost of solar modules have dropped. To compensate FSLR has worked hard to drop their operating costs but Im unsure if thats enough.

They also have a yieldco CAFD that pays a ~~13-15% dividend to those interested.~~ dividend growth is targeted at 13-15% 

Personally Im $3k deep

So, I use an International Broker to buy American securities. It's no big deal. What I do is, at the end of every month, I send $1,350 to my account.

There are times, however, when I see market opportunities (like an unexpected dip, or whatever) and I have no cash in the account. This is because I already used the $1,350 for other investments for that month.

In this case, can I trade using margin and pay it back at the end of the month? Is there a cost to using Margin (and I don't mean the cost of losing it all, I mean fees, expenses, interest, etc.)

I don't have any plans on using Margin to pay for investments with money I don't actually have.",1

Ominously, net wealth has reached that level only twice before: from 1999 to 2000 during the Nasdaq bubble, and 2004 to 2008 during the housing boom...

&gt;But the arithmetic reality is that when valuations are so high, even justifiably so, it takes only a small shift in the appetite for risk, expectations of profits, or interest rates to trigger a major downdraft. The U.S. Treasury’s Office of Financial Research noted this week that stocks have reached today’s valuations “only ahead of the three largest equity market declines in the last century.”

There is no single answer to this question, but we will also need A LOT MORE information if we are to give some sort of answer

* How old are you?
* Are you employed/making income? How much?
* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)
* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)
* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
* Any big debts?
* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.

16-07-28,4v0gen,Question about companies acquiring other companies.,"A company I have invested in (Meda) is currently in the process of being bought by another pharmaceutical company called Mylan. Mylan is offering 165 SEK per share, despite this however the shares are only trading at around 158 SEK. This seems to indicate that the market doesn't believe that Mylan will go through with the purchase. However according to the research I have done both Meda and Mylan have agreed on the purchase and they have gotten clearance from the U.S FTC and from the European commission. Doesn't this mean that the purchase is basically guaranteed and the trading price should be much closer to 165 SEK? Am I missing a big step that they still have to take, or is the market just worried that Mylan wont follow through with the high price?

Sorry if I didn't write this correctly, I'm relatively new to investing and its the first time posting here. Any help would be appreciated, thanks.",0

By now you should know that SA began liquidating inventory at the beginning of summer. Dick’s was well aware when it announced fiscal Q1’16 earnings on May 19 and lowered its fiscal Q2’16 guidance to 67 EPS.  They didn’t guide revenue, but did issue SSS guidance of -4% to -1%. According to yahoo, the analysts’ consensus revenue estimate calls for Q2'16 is $1.88B compared to $1.82B in Q2'15, or YoY growth of 3%, and EPS of 68 cents for Q2'16. 

I come to you WSB for thoughts, sentiment, or any shit commentary on DKS’ chance to miss/beat this quarter. Keeping in mind they could miss, and still give good guidance, anybody think it’s worth betting against? $50 puts currently trade at ~$1.50 for August 19 expiration, that’s a modest ~4% premium. Last note, DKS hasn’t set a date yet for earnings but it is likely August 16th. They reported on the 18th of August in 2015 and 19th the year before, in each case the third Tuesday.

16-07-28,4v0i0k,[Question] ETF Construction Question,"I was reading this on Wikipedia. Could someone give me a little more insight about what they mean in the 3rd paragraph regarding borrowing from a pension fund. Do they actually mean pension fund?

""How an ETF is Created
An ETF has many advantages over a mutual fund including costs and taxes. The creation and redemption process for ETF shares is almost the exact opposite of that for mutual fund shares. When investing in mutual funds, investors send cash to the fund company, which then uses that cash to purchase securities and in turn issues additional shares of the fund. When investors wish to redeem their mutual fund shares, they are returned to the mutual fund company in exchange for cash. Creating an ETF, however, does not involve cash.

The process begins when a prospective ETF manager (known as a sponsor) files a plan with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to create an ETF. Once the plan is approved, the sponsor forms an agreement with an authorized participant, generally a market maker, specialist or large institutional investor, who is empowered to create or redeem ETF shares. (In some cases, the authorized participant and the sponsor are the same.)

The authorized participant borrows stock shares, often from a pension fund, places those shares in a trust and uses them to form ETF creation units. These are bundles of stock varying from 10,000 to 600,000 shares, but 50,000 shares is what's commonly designated as one creation unit of a given ETF. Then, the trust provides shares of the ETF, which are legal claims on the shares held in the trust (the ETFs represent tiny slivers of the creation units), to the authorized participant. Because this transaction is an in-kind trade - that is, securities are traded for securities - there are no tax implications. Once the authorized participant receives the ETF shares, they are sold to the public on the open market just like stock shares.

When ETF shares are bought and sold on the open market, the underlying securities that were borrowed to form the creation units remain in the trust account. The trust generally has little activity beyond paying dividends from the stock, held in the trust, to the ETF owners, and providing administrative oversight. This is because the creation units are not impacted by the transactions that take place on the market when ETF shares are bought and sold.

october 23rd 2015 - 98 to 127.29 within a week

they fucking beat EPS by 20 fucking cents...and projected higher EBITDA and more efficient marketing margins...if anyone listened to their CEO's talk with analysts at RBC Markets here's an excerpt that you should glance over - the miss in revenue was already expected so no one gave a fuck about their miss https://gyazo.com/97a7014c72588c5c9a400694084a43cb - they are being more efficient with their money and marketing. i urge you to listen in on their conference calls the CEO is a fucking genius and try telling me you don't have faith in the company and their goals after listening to it

16-07-29,4v71hy,Where do I start? (Not the question you think),"I've read numerous books and I've gone through most of the online resources mentioned in the wiki. I understand the concepts and so on and so forth. 

There's one burning question I've had and not a single book has really touched on it in a way that I felt answered my question. 

That question is: where do I start my research?

Let me explain. I have a brokerage account with a decently performing portfolio of 6 different stocks. Truth be told, I simply lucked into them. I picked some companies that I simply liked. I knew nothing about them and bought them before I went through all the educational stuff.

So many brokerage sites advertise ""we have everything you need to research and make good decisions"". I'm trying to figure out *what* to research in the first place. Were I to start research a stock today, how would I go about picking a stock to research? Is it still a matter of ""this company sounds interesting"" or is there some place that says ""hey, keep an eye on these""? Is there another way to pick potential leads?

I see a lot of posts say ""just buy some indexes or ETFs and be done with it"". Again, outside of Vanguard, where is a good starting place for researching ETFs.

I don't want to be starting my research the same way the Archie gang picked their vacation spots (blindfold Jughead, give him a dart and spin the globe). With all the available options, it just doesn't make sense to randomly pick {Insert Symbol Here} then either buy or eliminate it.

Truth be told, I don't even know if I've explained my confusion properly. I am literally confused as to why I'm confused. Perhaps someone speaks fluent noob and can translate? ",3

16-07-28,4v0n11,ELI5: How Your Stocks Get Taxed (an Explanation of Capital Gains Taxes),"Hello all,
A common question I often see pop up on this sub, is ""how do my stocks get taxed?"" In simplest ELI5 terms, I'm going to try to explain. 

**Am I taxed when I purchase the stock?** No, you are not taxed on the *purchase* of a stock. When you buy a stock, the money you use to buy it is from *post-tax income.* You've already paid your dues to Uncle Sam at this point. You'll (possibly) pay a commission to your broker, but no tax. 

So, here's what you need to know, there are two kinds of capital gains taxes to be aware of, and note, they only occur **at the sale of the stock:** 

* **Short Term Capital Gains Tax:** Stock is purchased and sold within one year. *This is treated as ordinary taxable income, equal to your federal income tax rate.* 

* **Long Term Capital Gains Tax:** Stock is purchased and sold after one year and one day. *Depending on your income bracket, the gain will be taxed at 0, 15%, or 19.6%.* 

Confused? Let's go through some scenarios here to see how these taxes are applied: 

On January 1, 2016. Jimmy buys 200 shares of $MTCH at a value of $5 per share. **Jimmy starts with $1,000 in stock value.** Let us assume that Jimmy has a federal income tax rate of 28% and a long-term capital gains rate of 15%. 

Scenario|Date|Shares|Share Price|Total Gain|Tax Rate|**Net Gain (Less Capital Gains)**|
--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
Jimmy purchases the stock|1/1/2016 (Purchase)|200|$5|$0|N/A|**$0**|
Jimmy sells the stock six months in after share price goes up to $15|7/1/2016 (Sale)|200|$15|+$2,000|Short Term (28%)|**$1,440**|
Jimmy sells the stock a year and a day later after share price goes up to $15|1/2/2017 (Sale)|200|$15|+$2,000|Long Term (15%)|**$1,700**|
Jimmy sells the stock a year and a day later after it goes up $20|1/2/2017 (Sale)|200|$20|+$3,000|Long Term (15%)|**$2,550**|

The moral of the story here, is that good things come for those who wait when it comes to Capital Gains taxes. If Jimmy had sold his $MTCH portfolio at $15 a share on 1/2/2017 instead of 7/1/2016, he would have paid $260 less in taxes! 

Hope this helps as a basic explanation. ",98

Thoughts:

1. The US-specific hotel REITs have likely had trouble because of a stronger dollar that has resulted in lower incoming tourism, but the question now seems to be has it gone beyond that with concerns about corporate travel and NYC in particular.

2. Equity Residential (EQR) is a major apartment REIT and their views on the coasts are also concerning.

Am I going to do anything different because of this? No. Are there still things (individual names, sectors, etc) doing exceedingly well and that will continue to do so? Absolutely.

It's just something to watch.",4

# Description
Starbucks Corporation is the roaster, marketer and retailer of specialty coffee. And they are pretty much all over the world by now.

## Recent financials 

Despite the global reach, it's not overdone it yet, like a McDonalds. And the grow is still pretty healthy.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $19.2bn | $16.5bn | $14.9bn | $13.3bn | $11.7bn|
|EPS | $1.82 | $1.35 | $0.01 | $0.90 | $0.81|

## Competition

From their SEC filing

&gt; Our primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee shops and quick-service restaurants. In almost all markets in which we do business, there are numerous competitors in the specialty coffee beverage business. We continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the U.S. quick-service restaurant sector and the U.S. ready-to-drink coffee beverage market, in addition to well-established companies in many international markets. We also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores.

It's impressive that their sales are now in reaching distance of McDonald's! Similarly margins are really impressive. 

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Starbucks Corporation | $20,520M | 22% | N/A
McDonald's Corporation | $25,125M | 35% | N/A
Yum! Brands, Inc. | $13,005M | 21% | N/A
Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. | $4,047M | 12% | 11%

Domino's Pizza, Inc. | $2,312M | 20% | N/A
Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. | $2,886M | 12% | 32%

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $66.33 price target for Starbucks and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 15% to their target.

# Valuation

Its impressive growth is clearly reflected in the price at 31x earnings and just 1% dividend yield. Am pretty flabbergasted that it's hard to find any of these stocks trading less than 20x.

CBRL.O | $3,729M | 21x | 9% | 5% | 10%

# Dividends

Starbucks Corporation is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.81 per share. The forecast dividend of $0.81 compares to a forecast EPS of $1.89. and there is a generous buyback too

&gt; We returned $2.4 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2015 through share repurchases and dividends compared to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2014.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 3% that compares with no change in the earnings forecasts. That's against a backdrop of sales up 10% in the 9 months to end June.

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/sbux/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers.
&gt; We now expect global comp growth of 5% for Q4 and mid-single-digit comp growth globally for fiscal year 2016. 

and

&gt; Given the strong operating results we're generating from our new stores, particularly in our largest markets such as the U.S. and China, we now expect to add approximately 1,900 net new stores globally in fiscal 2016, up from our previous guidance.

So the world's demand for coffee, Starbucks coffee, is showing no signs of abating. Coffee prices have helped recently. The company is investing in loyalty programs and apps to increase repeat visits. 

So, there don't seem to be any clouds on the horizon. But as a result, you have to pay up for $SBUX.

16-07-28,4v0zmj,Shorting AIG for ER,"## AIG

### Overview

The only reason I know about AIG is because I watched ""Too Big To Fail"" on Netflix and they were an absolute disgrace in that. They are an insurance company.

### Quarterly Earnings Surprise History

[http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/aig](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/aig)

AIG has posted significant Earnings Surprises in the last three Earnings Reports. All of those earnings surprises have been significant misses.

Fiscal Quarter End | Date Reported | Earnings Per Share | Consensus EPS* Forecast | % Surprise
---|---|---|---|---
Mar2016 | 05/02/2016 | 0.65 | 0.99 | -34.34
Dec2015 | 02/11/2016 | -1.1 | -0.9 | -22.22
Sep2015 | 11/02/2015 | 0.52 | 1.03 | -49.51
Jun2015 | 08/03/2015 | 1.39 | 1.22 | 13.93

### Technical Analysis

Just take a look at this chart real quick:

[http://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aig&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d](http://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aig&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d)

57 would be the ""win"" price target. 49 would be the “lose” target. These targets fit within the short-term trend but also have shown long-term support.

### Low Volatility

As I am typing this, IV on Aug 5 puts is at a reasonable 27%. Volatility has ramped up significantly before each previous earnings report and this one should be no different. The increased volatility will increase the value of our long options leading up to ER.

### Strategy

Given that AIG has consistently disappointed come earnings time, and is currently trading near the top of its trading area right now, I would puts now that expire after earnings.

Another option would be to purchase some calls once you’re in the money on your puts to make it a strangle. Or to buy the strangle from the get-go.

Volatility is likely to ramp up leading up to earnings, increasing the value of your long options. If you are a little fucking pussy and don’t buy this until right before ER, you are likely to pay more due to higher IV.

### Disclaimer

I don’t know what the fuck I’m talking about and if you take my advice you’re dumber than fucking Jim Cramer.

I like Airbnb because it is already used globally and operating in a less saturated market. I think government regulations could catch up to Uber and Lyft slowing their growth significantly. What your opinions on companies like these? Would you recommend investing as soon as one of these companies has their IPO or waiting and seeing how it does in the market?

16-07-29,4v7g3h,Thoughts on HCN? Earning on Tuesday 8/2,"I've been following HCN Welltower Inc since mid June and been looking for some kind of pullback before getting in, however, no pullback has happened. It's slowly ticked upwards since Feb. I want to buy and hold this for awhile because of the nice dividend and because the trend is great. However, even holding something long term I'd like to get in at a nice price. Right now it's at it's YTD high and approaching it's all time high. Of course earnings could be a catalyst to push it over it's all time highs or it could also be a catalyst for the pullback I've been waiting for to enter. I hate playing earnings so I'll probably sit this one out but I just wanted to get some other thoughts on the stock if anyone would like to share them. Thanks.",1

16-07-28,4v12nn,[Question] Why does Oracle (ORCL) acquires Netsuite (N) for $9.3B but at a stock price of $109 per share?,"From Google Finace and Yahoo Finance, Netsuite has about 80.44M shares outstanding. At $109 per shares, Netsuite is worth 109 * 80.44M = 8,767.96 M or $8.7B. Using $9.3B as a start, Netsuite share is worth about $115.6/share.

In the articles, it is also mentioned that there's a 19% premium, but it's based on the Wednesday closing price of about $92.22, the premium is already included in the $109 price.

How do companies decide on an IPO price, is it arbitrary or is there a basis on choosing this price?



When a company opens to the public, it is an effort to raise money but how does a company decide on how many shares to offer when it decides to go public? 



When stock-shares of a company increase in value, is this face value as well as intrinsic value? 



When a stock increases in value, how does it benefit the company? Is it just a representation of (potential) success? 



Can stocks sometimes be traded at face value with little to no relationship to how the company is preforming? E.g. One day Rocks are valued higher than Scissors, suddenly people are feeling Scissors are valued higher than Paper and so on... 



Are stocks always a representation of how the company is preforming? Is this how stocks can sometimes be under or overvalued? 



What is the deciding factor on how many shares should initially be offered? Does company XYZ decide they want to allot 20% of the company to shareholders, 25%, 30%? Why and how are these decisions made?



Is there anything a company can earn from shareholders other than it's initial public offer of fund raising? 



How does market capitalization correspond with earnings and success of a company, or does it at all? 



Is shares outstanding the number of shares total the company has out? 



Is it ever possible that a company has unsold shares?

Notice that there are two charts, one with this header:

&gt; If you are either a citizen or legal resident of the United States **and enable your account for margin on or after September 26,** 2016, your margin interest rate will be based on the following:

And one with this header:

&gt; If you are either a citizen or legal resident of the United States **and enable your account for margin before September 26, 2016,** margin rates are increasing for Average Daily Debit Balances less than $250,000. The margin rates for Average Daily Debit Balances of $250,000 or more will remain the same. The new margin interest rates will be based on the following:

The key thing here is that depending whether you activated margin on your account before or after Sept 26, your rates are drastically different, with those whose accounts were activated *after* 9/26 having interest rates 2% lower or even more.

This makes zero sense to me, and when I called them the customer service was completely unable to explain it. They had no more insight into the reasoning behind the policy than I did.

Has anyone got any insight into this, or seen this happen before? Can I simply deactivate margin on my account, then reactivate it after 9/26? Why would they institute a policy rewarding new customers and punishing long-time customers?",8

16-07-29,4v81ez,A mental trick I use that may help some of you make more money trading,"Over the long run, it is tough to be consistently profitable when trading, yoloing, etc. You may get on a hot streak for a while, but the laws of probability eventually catch up to every one of us and we learn how tough it is to make constant money trading. If you haven't had this experience yet and think I'm full of shit, you will soon know what I am talking about.

One of my biggest struggles in becoming consistently profitable has always been grabbing profits too soon. I used to get 2 or 3 losing trades in a row, and by the time trade 4 rolled around I would be so happy to be in the green that I would grab a quick 20 cent profit, only to watch the trend take off for another dollar higher, leaving me on the sidelines. If you are like me and do this destructive behavior, you will never make any real money trading. The laws of probability simply do not allow it.

To eliminate this destructive behavior, whenever I am thinking about exiting a profitable trade, I ask myself ""would you be willing to short this stock right here, right now?"" If the answer to that question is ""no way"", then there is also no way I should be selling the stock to close my position and book a profit. Except for the fact that you get flat, there is no difference between selling your position to close and short-selling a stock.

So under what circumstances is it insane to short-sell a stock? Examples I can think of are:

* after 3 or more big green spiking bars in a row
* at/near the high of the day/month/year/decade
* If a stock has been relentlessly trending up for many bars above the 20 period MA, and is still above the 20 period MA

If any of you find yourselves in an emotionally charged state, and you are itching to impulsively book profits, ask yourself if you think it would be safe to take a short position at that very moment. If the answer is ""no"", then keep your position on until the answer becomes ""yes"". Doing so will likely help you make a lot more money over the long run. ",52

The fee is 1.5% to buy at the start and 1.75% annual subscription fee, which I think is pretty high for a passively managed fund (although still cheaper than actively managed ones). 

So, I was wondering if it's a good idea to copy the portfolio myself? I mean, it's only 30 companies so I should be able to manually input the orders, and the fee is around 0.4% for selling and buying, without any annual fees. That means for every 10,000$ I'll save 1.1% + 1.75% per year, or 110$ + 175$ on year 1 and 175$ on every next year.

What do you guys think? Am I missing something? Is there some way that I might be disadvantaged by doing it myself?",4
16-07-29,4v837b,"$MACK, could be approaching something big.","$MACK is the head company for one very interesting drug. Onivyde was approved back in October 22nd 2015. The drug is a combination of the chemotherapy drug irinotecan, fluorouracil and lucovorin. The drug is specifically for the treatment of patients who have 'metastatic adenocarcinoma' of the pancreas (a form of cancer). 

The drug itself is complicated, but it has been approved, and is showing positive signs of not only results, but sales. I will not go into too much detail regarding the drug, approval process or anything like that, as I am simply looking at the business side. If you need more information, visit their patient site https://www.onivyde.com/for-patients/. It has A LOT of information regarding the drug. I have read through it a couple of times, and I am very impressed with the way in which they handled the approval process, FDA testing and now administration of the drug. 

In the fourth quarter of 2015 alone, it boasted over $4 million in sales, which covered just the final two months (due to be being released in late October). Considering the rate at which a new drug sometimes takes to be administered, this seems to me like an exceptionally fast growth for the drug. It should also be noted that in March 2016, the drug had already reached **75% of targeted national and regional payers**.

During the end of last year, and leading into 2016, stock suffered, as did much of the market. However, when the Q4 earnings results arrived, the stock shot up from around $5.50 to $8+. This was not the same for first quarter 2016 results. According to their Q1 financial results, there was 133% growth in the market (speaking specifically about ONIVYDE). The market had no reaction to this news, which was interesting, as the market reacted very well to the first month of sales.  

These numbers are outstanding for a new drug, as they show real interest in prescribing to the market. Assuming ONIVYDE is able to achieve approval for frontline metastatic cancer (currently in phase 2 of trials), it would take the patient base from just under 20,000 and increase it to 70,000. This would potentially create a $1-$1.5 billion market. This alone gives us the price point we have regarding $MACK, as an annual turnover like this should make the company much more valuable than the low $700-750 million market cap it has now. Similar ideas have been shared on Seeking Alpha, so please check there too!

**Future Drugs**

However, this is not the final story. Along with ONVIYDE, $MACK has two other major assets in MM-302 and MM-121. 

MM-121 began its phase II study in February 2015,  still in the midsts of this trial right now. This drug is aiming to meet the need for non-small cell lung cancer, something which has a very high unmet need in the market. The potential size of this field is huge, seeing worldwide peak sales reaching a maximum of $2 billion. Again, another huge drug. I wouldn't expect anything lower than $1.3-1.6 billion for this drug.

MM-302 is another drug currently in the FDA approval process. Focused on metastatic breast cancer, boasting 9,000-10,000 potential patents in the US (maybe a slight over estimate, but by no more than 1,000). Even this drug could be looking at 400-500 million a year, adding further to the companies potential value. 

**Stock Pricing**

Assuming that no other drugs are approved, and it takes ONIVYDE between 6-7 years to reach max potential. I don't see why the company shouldn't be placed in the $1.3billion range for a buyout. I understand this isn't the same Bio market that existed a few years ago, but the company is boasting fantastic sales numbers, and is continuing to grow. 

As I said, ONIVYDE is not the only aspect of this company, MM-302 and MM-121 seem to be both very promising attributes for $MACK. I understand that the approval rate it low, however, if approved and there has been no buyout before this approval, I could see the stock price skyrocketing. However, I do not believe $MACK will survive too much longer past the entrance into the phase 3 of the FDA study. The company looks too appealing. 

If we value the markets of these two drugs with a 25% chance of approval, and priced accordingly, I don't see why we shouldn't be staring at a $2.2-5 billion buyout ($18 stock price).

**Future**

My assumptions could be wildly off, however I know for sure that there is only really one direction for the company to go in the long run, and that is up. ONIVYDE alone is proving to be both a fantastically efficient drug, and Merrimack is doing a great job selling it. 

I am into $MACK for just over 5,000 shares. 

I also picked up 150 August 19th $6 Calls. 2nd quarter earnings report should be on the 4th of August, so hopefully I will be able to execute that call, and pick up a high return on the cheap (I am basing this call purchase on the reaction after the Q4 earnings report from last year, the Bio market seems ripe and ready to invest, so I see a lot of buying from even the smallest bit of excitement). 

*If I am wrong about anything, or you have any questions, please correct me. New information is good information, as it helps me make decisions too.*

Good luck!

Either a) this is a really bullish opportunity for market consolidation and stock buyouts, or b) all of those software developers in Silicon Valley who have these crazy salaries and super expensive housing will soon figure out that they can't make actual revenue.

I recognize that the cloud is a whole new space to discover revenue, as is augmented reality, so maybe I should be hella bullish.

# Description
Universal Forest Products, Inc. is a holding company. The Company, through its subsidiaries, supplies wood, wood composite and other products to three primary markets: retail, construction and industrial.

## Recent financials 

Even though timber prices were down last year, volume growth was good. $UFPI outperformed both in the consumer and industrial markets. Clearly the recovery is doing them a lot of good.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $2.9bn | $2.7bn | $2.5bn | $2.1bn | $1.8bn|
|EPS | $3.99 | $2.86 | $2.15 | $1.21 | $0.23|

## Competition

In the retail market (NB: Home Depot is their largest customer = 19% all sales!)

&gt; The customers comprising are national home center retailers, retail-oriented regional lumberyards and contractor-oriented lumberyards. We are not aware of any competitor that currently manufactures, treats and distributes a full line of both value-added and commodity products on a national basis.  

In the industrial market:

&gt; We define our industrial market as manufacturers and agricultural customers who use pallets, specialty crates, wooden boxes, and other containers used for packaging, shipping and material handling purposes. Competition is fragmented.

In the construction market:

&gt; Our construction market is made up of customers in three submarkets - manufactured housing, residential construction and commercial construction. Competition is fragmented, but we do compete with a small number of national and regional retail contractor yards.


|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Universal Forest Products, Inc. | $2,970M | 7% | 13%
Louisiana-Pacific Corporation | $1,925M | 5% | -ve
Boise Cascade Co | $3,704M | 4% | 10%
GMS Inc | $1,858M | 7% | 4%
Cavco Industries, Inc. | $712M | 7% | 8%

UPM-Kymmene Corporation (ADR) | $11,068M | 15% | 13%
Stora Enso OYJ (ADR) | $11,027M | 16% | 15%

## Cash / Debt?
Universal Forest Products, Inc. has $12M of net cash. i.e. not a lot! But still, given this is a cyclical business, am happier to see that.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $100.00 for Universal Forest Products, Inc. and their recommendation to clients is _Hold_. That implies an upside of -7% to their target. Oh dear!

# Valuation

Versus the Paper Giants in Europe the US market is trading at twice the earnings multiple. The free cash flow yield is half and the dividends a fraction. Is that divergence really merited based on the different economic prospects?

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/ufpi.o/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|

SEOAY.PK | $7,125M | 11x | -14% | 4% | 27%

# Dividends
Universal Forest Products, Inc. paid a dividend of $0.82 last year. That's just a fraction of earnings.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 41% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 10%. With sales up 6% in the last 6 months.

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ufpi/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers.
&gt; To achieve sales growth and add value, we continue to pursue both our acquisition growth and our organic growth plans. International manufacturing growth via acquisition remains a challenge. We are having difficult time finding acceptable companies and an investment value which permits our ROI model to work.

It seems that the stock's been rerated recently driven by a substantial increase in its gross margin and continued healthy top line growth. But can that continue? Are we just late to the party?

I'm a little wary to short because the downside is theoretically infinite whereas the upside is only 100%, and TSLA investors are not a rational bunch so it could take a while to play out. As they say, the market can stay irrational for longer than you can stay solvent.

Therefore, I'd like to be a little more conservative and buy put options on TSLA; however, I've never traded options before. I'm rather savvy with investing/stocks (I read 10-Ks, accounting textbooks, etc.) so I just want to make sure I know what I'm doing before diving in.

Let me explain something quickly:
This trial was not designed to show efficacy. At all. In fact, they *clearly* didn't give a flying shit (relevant) about efficacy.

Phase 1 which showed their exceptional results had two points

1. Antibiotics were required to be discontinued
2. A ""bowel preparation"" was required - basically an extreme laxative, the day before or during dosing

Neither of these happened in phase 2. I CANNOT UNDERESTIMATE HOW REQUIRED THIS IS FOR THEIR DRUG TO WORK. *ITS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL*

The general strategy being          
&gt;Short US equity           
&gt;Long US treasuries        
&gt;Long hard assets: gold miners and farm land       
&gt;Long EM          

Additionally        

&gt;Short/Avoid Indexes    
&gt;Long specific stocks     
&gt;Long active management (timing and position sizing)     

There has been no movement of capital (distribution or contribution) since last month. I have switched methodology to reporting at month end.

Performance has been achieved maintaining a 35-45% position in U.S. Treasuries and Cash.       

&gt;Performance: May: -2.2%, June: 12.4%, July:8.1%, Since Start: 18.8%         
&gt;Benchmark (SPY+dividend) May: 1.4%, June 0.6%, July 3.1%, Since Start: 5.2%         

Current 1 month performance is 8.1%, primarily driven by the rally in gold on the backs of continued lowered expectation of a rate hike coupled with continuing recovery in EM sentiments.  There has been a rebound high quality companies trading at distressed pricing in EM. 

I added back my position in GDXJ exited prior to brexit during the brief pullback in gold. 

CRESY continues to do well as Argentinian farmland continue to converge to Brazilian comp levels and the significant pasture land of the company can be profitably converted into cash crop raising with the steadied scrapping of the agricultural tariff.  

ARCOs has managed through the worst of its currency translation issues. Management is very competent and debt covenant and franchise agreement issues have been settled. 

I have remained closed in my short SPY position since June 28. I have been caught off guard by the recovery in bullish sentiments despite no reliable data showcasing additional inflow coming from Europe and Japan but will bring back the net short positions over the coming months should new PMI data support a potential recession in the U.S. 

New position added include a 2k position in Nintendo. I think there is significant discount to the company at the 20-25(ADR) range given ~USD10 billion in cash and IP value of atleast USD10-15 billion. The company, should it capitalize on its success with pokemon go, could easily take the top 5 spots in mobile gaming with its existing brands, in such a scenario, the company could be worth over USD100 billion based on comps. There is sufficient margin of safety for the company at a current valuation of 30-33 billion for the risk-reward to be compelling.

I did some real basic DD on the companies behind some of the successful drugs mentioned.

The company behind Opdivoy and Yeroy is Bristol Meyers Squibb - BMY
Trading at 74.81 and ATH is 77 in 99
The company behind Keytruda is MRK which is trading at 58.66 with a ATH of 88 in 2000. Both companies crashed in 2007 and have been consistently uptrending since.

With possible cancer treatment drugs I'm thinking they may propel passed ATH for many years. Invest now and buy a yacht in 10 years when immunotherapy drugs are the go-to remedy for Cancer?

16-07-30,4vddeg,Is my strategy ill-advised?,"Inb4 ""yes"", but please read first.

My strategy is to use informed personal judgement about which price changes are overreactions or underreactions to earnings reports and political events. I hold most shares for 1 day-10 weeks until I think it's back where it should be. I use robinhood so there are no trade fees.


I trade exclusively 8 very large cap companies from 3 industries whose news I follow religiously. I don't short-sell, only normal buy then sell.



I'm coming up on 1 year of trading. I started last September with $100 and kept adding money slowly over time at about $600/month to end up now investing with ~$7000. If I had been putting every deposit in SPY at it's lowest price on the first of every month, I would have made $235.24 in this time period. (That's a very generous number since I would not have gotten it at it's lowest price for the day at every buy). With my strategy I'm $725 in the black.


I just sold all my holdings and am taking a break from trading until after the US presidential election. If anyone is curious why I'll answer in comments.


I know the general knowledge is ""just buy and hold a diversified portfolio, day traders don't beat the market over time"" but it's hard for me to stop while I'm doing so well. This is not my retirement savings; that, I don't touch. This is money I plan on using as a down payment on a house in 5-10 years.

16-07-30,4v9xa3,Question about margin brokerage account vs. cash brokerage account.,"I just opened a brokerage account on scottrade. But not just *any* brokerage account, a *margin* brokerage account. I did this on ""accident"". I was going to do a straight forward cash account, but the idea of being able to borrow in the future if there was some hot stock I wanted to buy but I was low on funds was just too appealing. This was just supposed to be a juicy line of credit that would sit there.
    Well, I associated a bank account, and put in a transfer of 8k. Then I started trading like some kind of bull on a trading floor....IBM typewriter corporation, Milton's Medical Leeches, *fro*-ghurt....I was a veritable Motley Fool!
      Then I realized, because the money you transfer from your bank account takes a day or so to clear, that I had bought all the stocks with *borrowed* money.
     My question is this: once my cash clears, will they pay off the margin debt immediately with it or ignore it and let that margin loan accrue its sweet sweet 8% APR?

And thats where the trouble lies you see, why does Bananya desire so much to become trendy?

16-07-30,4vand2,"From the Beginning 'Til Now: A Journey Through WSB","And now the story of a young trader who was dying for a yacht, and the one Reddit forum that is going to make it possible. This is BigDog's Trading Development. 

Hearing about WSB in a Market Watch article, I wasn't sure what to think really, I saw many millennial degenerates who would wage everything - and often lose everything - in the name of YOLO. Sure, I'm hip, and I got the term so I dove right in. When I first came to WSB I was a momentum trader, significantly relying on charts. 

So, sure enough I saw all these tickers on WSB geared for instant yacht. The first ticker I saw: TVIX. At the time I knew nothing about TVIX but with my charts man she looked ready to skyrocket!!! I dropped 3k on this, watched myself lose 25% of my investment in a few days and I was like, ""WTF my charts said yes."" Only later did I find out TVIX is an ETN that operates inverse the S&amp;P 500, and I lost a few hundred by the time I sold. Some of you may call me an idiot, but I'd call it a learning experience. WSB, thank you. 

At this point my yacht was looking more like a card board box. So, then I dove deeper into WSB and realized that you all were playing with these things called ""options."" I thought, what are these ""options."" So I asked you, and you gave me an answer, and I established an account at the cheapest brokerage where I could get options trading capability as a rookie yoloer - TradeKing. This shit show gave me the potential. 

Around May, I launched my first option trade, a put on FSLR, and I was like DAYUM, yacht city here I come, but then I got cocky and shelled another few hundred on the likes of Twitter and playing SPY weeklies. By June, I was washed out of my risk  money and needed a break. WSB sucked me in a shit me right out in a GFY fashion - I needed a break.

When Brexit came around I realized I needed the ""risk on, maybe lose all"" WSB attitude. I'd like to say that since Brexit when I hopped in on the lows I have made back my losses and finally have my head on straight. Currently I'm a college undergrad student who can see myself on a yacht in a few years with some hot hookers, and I owe it all to WSB. ",50

16-07-30,4vb4mn,A tip for people trying to play the market,"Timing is everything.

You can time the market, most of the time anyways. 
That most of the time isn't because it's impossible, rather that you miscalculated the effects of a event on the market.

Brexit was a scary event for the majority of people, however you should have been able to reasonably assume that it would be a short lived event for the following reason:

1. The announcement didn't actually do anything and Brexit at the time wasn't (and still isn't) locked in stone.

The harsh reaction (both initially of the Euro and Pound and the day after on markets all over the world) was because the market hadn't priced it in despite neck and neck polls (even if they were skewed in the favor of Bremain). If it was priced in and still reacted like it did then that would have been a different story. Others were saying the market reacted so harshly because it was the catalyst of an overdo recession, which was wrong. Those two facts combined meant that it would be a short lived event. 

The only thing that would have changed my mind would have been any other countries voted to leave as well. That wouldn't have happened though because of the implied threats from the EU, along with the general negative attitudes towards The Brexit all throughout Europe. Also out of the 27 member countries (I'm excluding the UK), only 8 (still excluding the UK) pay more than they put in to the EU. This automatically prohibits 19 member countries from leaving the EU. Out of the 8 member countries, 0 were very likely to leave because the only significant EU exit movements were from far right fringe parties who would not gain much traction. This would be true more so once the EU threatened the UK even further in the following weeks.

I bought on Friday (Brexit happened on Thursday night) which was a day too soon (I told myself to wait until next week but I could not wait) so I missed out on 4% gainz. Still 5%-7% gainz per stock in the span of 2-5 days is still pretty sweet.

The 2008 financial crash is a different matter, this crash actually has a significant affect on the market as well as other markets around the world. Since this event had a major direct impact on our market, as well as other markets around the world, was a good sign that this would take a much longer time to jump back.

If you try to systematically lay out events like this and weigh how likely certain events are then you'll have a lot better idea of what to do than 90% of people. Everyone was gung-ho to buy in on Thursday night, but few did once they started hearing the news outlets talking about it.

Plain old market drops like the one that bottomed out on February 11th are a bit trickier because it could be the start of a bear market, however there's a certain point where it's down so low that unless there was a major event to justify it's continual drop, it will go back up. 

The major risk on the above mentioned point is that there's all the signs pointing to a recession/depression but you just don't see them and the market keeps on dropping. The safe guard for this is to keep 75%-80% of your assets in cash or some other physical form like cars (iconic classic cars, not some new stuff obviously). Obviously if you're going all in with only $1000 on RH, then you probably won't even get this far in my post.

If you use events like these to take positions rather than relying on the day to day grind of picking stocks at random times, then you will have better and more consistent gainz (they won't happen as much, so you have to make sure that you maximize gainz when opportunities present themselves). While you will never be 100% right, you should be able to easily capture 50% of the maximum that's to be had from an event relative to the type of vehicle you use to capture said gainz (stocks, options, property, or whatever else you can think of).",69

I am curious to hear people's thoughts on investing money into LendingClub (providing loans, not buying the stock).

I've used it for 2 years now, and have a 6% net annualized return. I reinvest the payments I get into more loans, and also have a monthly deposit from my bank account. 

That being said, it's still a small portion of my net worth (1.70% to be exact), so I'm not significantly vested.  I'm planning to keep the money in this and not withdrawing it for a while (30 years or so), to hopefully let it compound into something significant.

You spent, just on the option, $100 + 10 = $110.

To make back $110 at a strike price of $35 for 1 contract, the share must drop to $33.9.

16-07-31,4vj7ej,How can put options be profitable?,"First off, strike prices are in increments of $5, maybe $2.50 if the stock is popular enough. So with a stock at $40, and a strike price of $35, that's a $5 drop.

Now, say the premium is 1.00 per share, so $100 per contract. And add in $10 for the contract itself.

You spent, just on the option, $100 + 10 = $110.

To make back $110 at a strike price of $35 for 1 contract, the share must drop to $33.9.

AND, if your option expires in a week, then you need AT LEAST a 15.25% drop in the stock price IN A WEEK to stay above water. That's pretty crazy.

Am I misunderstanding put options?

generally one might join and have some retarded questions so i thought i might ask the most basic and dumb one of them all.

the shit is a stock?

so uh a question for my ""friend"".
the hell is a stock? a portion of a company bought and sold? how are stocks physically owned; is it a central entity or is it monitored by the company's? if i have a 100 dollar bill whats steps will i need to go through to turn that into a stock in my name if i have never touched the investment field before? and can one manage their own stocks without any 3rd party services?

and most importantly what did you regret not doing when you entered the market?

16-07-31,4vfdhw,"WSB, what have you learned since you started following WSB?","Saturday night is the BEST time to post about stocks...

Personally, [sometimes the hard way,] I've learned:  

1) If I want to short something, I will only short it if I expect it to drop *this week*.  If I think the time horizon is further than 1 week, I am better off holding the cash and waiting for the drop to re-enter a long position.  

2)  'tis better to react to market overreactions than to try to predict market reactions.  The reality is these motherfuckers don't always react rationally.  And on top of that, their irrationality can cause you to do the opposite of what makes sense, to protect yourself.  e.g. You bet long on positive ER, and market reacts by dropping the price, so you sell out of fear, only to realize the price rebounds after a day or two.  Shit is crazy.  Be patient and wait for the crazy.  Recognize the crazy.  React intelligently to the crazy.  

3)  Estimate what the market has already priced in vs. the probability of it happening.  E.g. Brexit and every ER ever.  If the market fully expects one result and therefore you expect no market reaction to it occurring, than you should evaluate the low-probability bet relative to the expected payout.  Example 1) If 80% of people expect AAPL to have shitty earnings after they just reduced guidance in a low-activity quarter, the likelihood AAPL misses guidance is lower than 50% because they had just taken the opportunity to reduce guidance last quarter.  No product launches = predictable forecast = AAPL is going to hit their guidance.  Go long.  Duh.  Example 2) Everyone expects Bremain i.e. the S&amp;P goes up sharply prior to the vote, maybe short that shit because if Brexit, than huge drop.  If Bremain, than nothing changes.   

These all seem like no-brainers, but I guarantee MFers make these mistakes all the time due to biases.

16-07-31,4vjebj,Thoughts on LXRX?,"This DD performed approximately 1 year ago covers the benefits of their LX1032 (Telotristat etiprate) drug [which is up for PDUFA on 11/30/2016], but doesn't really go over the prospects of their second drug LX4211 (Sotagliflozin) https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3b0fm1/dd_on_lxrx/

From the FDA calendar, I'm seeing that this drug is due for Phase 3 data any time in 2H 2016. Data from this drug showed statistical significance in phase 2 for both primary and secondary endpoints and appears to be administered orally, which is a plus? Seems like it has a pretty good shot at success, and they're running something like 3 Phase 3's on this drug.

This note, along with 95% institutional ownership, seemed interesting.

""Under the terms of the agreement, Lexicon will receive an upfront payment of $300 million and is eligible to receive development, regulatory and sales milestone payments of up to $1.4 billion. Lexicon is also entitled to tiered, escalating double digit percentage royalties on net sales of sotagliflozin. ""

16-07-31,4vjhde,A bearish case for $NVDA - YOLO potential,"My hypothesis is that they're overbought and overvalued at current prices. Since they have earnings coming in in less than two weeks I thought I'd share my $0.02.

[Let's look at the chart.](https://i.imgur.com/F6RB9A3.jpg) This weekly chart looking back around a year. As you can see they've grown over 200% in this period. They're pushing at all time highs right now. If you prescribe to mean reversion, shorting is a no brainier. Just look at MACD. 

Also note that RSI on the weekly chart is approaching 90. A very strong indicator that this is overbought and we may see some covering from market makers.

Because so many analysts have made a bullish case for $NVDA after the Q1 earnings report, put options are quite cheap, which is a good setup for big gains if they don't deliver in a couple weeks. 

I recently listened to their Q1 earnings conference call, as well read through their 10Q. Granted, their results were impressive. I question their ability to deliver comparable results in Q2. Datacenter, auto and gaming were strong. Increased competition (e.g. $AMD) is also a consideration driving my hypothesis.

Disclosure - probably going to short within the next 72 hours via puts. Unsure about time frames but I'm looking at $49 and $38 as key levels.

If anything, a cheap YOLO. If I'm wrong, fuck me. If I'm right, GFY.",24

1.  This is a roll up flotation i.e all the companies grouped together to float are debt free and profitable.  strong companies in fact.
2.  The board have done this before with the first IPO gaining 500% in a few months.

16-07-31,4vfzf0,The stock market crash already happened. You missed it.,"It's increasingly clear to me that the stock market crash that everyone is expecting *already happened*, and that the recession everyone fears *happened and is over*.

First, the stock market crash. As you know, we're increasingly a society where the top 1% accrues all the wealth and power, while the rest are losing ground. This trend applies not only to individuals, but also to corporations. And so you see a divergence between the rich and powerful tech titans in the Nasdaq 100, and the smaller shit companies of the Russell 2000.
Look at IWM from its peak in 2015 to the trough in February. It declined nearly 27%. That was the crash! That was the 99% of loser companies falling behind. QQQ declined about 17% - still significant, but most of QQQ are tech companies with massive amounts of cash on the balance sheet.

What about the 0.8% GDP growth in Q1, and 1.2% growth in Q2? That was the recession. That's what a recession looks like when interest rates have been near zero for 8 years. That's how shallow ZIRP recessions are. Notice that Q2 GDP grows faster than Q1. That's the recovery.

Now that retail investors are holding short positions to a record degree; now that everyone and their mom are buying puts and VIX; now that everyone's in cash on the sidelines; the market has nowhere to go but higher.
The recession is over, the crash happened, and you missed it.

16-07-31,4vh6fh,SKLN,"They had a proxy vote recently for dilution and reverse split. Thinking both of them would pass indefinitely, I thought SKLN would become another GBSN piece of shit but **neither** of them passed which was a huge surprise to me. As it turns out, insiders only own 5.5% of the company so they don't have dominating control over the company's proxy vote. They are having a second proxy vote for a '*more reasonable*' dilution and reverse split. All shareholders holding by **August 3rd** will be able to vote on the second proxy. I still have high doubts of shareholders turning their decision for dilution or a reverse split. SKLN has until **October 10th** to comply to the $1 SP for 10 days. After the second proxy vote comes in SP should start trending up. Also, if they are desperate enough to want to do another proxy vote, insiders *may* try to buy more shares which would pump the stock up a bit. 

**To Recap**:

* Insiders may buy a shit ton of shares to influence the vote more in their favor and pump the stock. Watch for SEC filings.

* [Someone emailed the CEO recently and he hinted at positive PR being released in a week or two](https://fbcdn-photos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/v/t34.0-0/p206x206/13874614_10155064632362995_1689436527_n.png?oh=e0309c7cdb2615ce91ea1972ccc16225&amp;oe=57A026AD&amp;__gda__=1470180392_63de88c555b3680a56e317879f98e24a) that 'when we make some announcements things will improve'.

* The first proxy vote results is attracting new investors and the second one will make the stock soar in a few weeks if it is in shareholders' favor again.

* They have cash on hand and have no debts. If upcoming ER (**August 8th - August 15th**) shows no debts as well that can send SKLN flying too.

* This looks like it can be anywhere between a short term to moderate term play. (1 to 5 weeks)

* My position per stock (containing my trades over time)

16-07-31,4vhv3b,"PSA: PokéGo's popular cheating method has been shut down","I'm not sure if this will have any effect on NTDOY since Niantic is a separate company from what I've gathered. Recently the website pokevision.com found a way to scan your area and find exactly where they appear. Pokevision has made the game so easy to the point where dozens of cars can be seen slowing down and stopping to catch a rare one. Sometime in the last 24 hours the website has been shut down resorting players to aimlessly walk around hoping to see them. I predict a significant drop in players over the next few days. I know McD was in the process of partnering up with Niantic and I'm probably missing a few. For those of you looking for the real end of POGOs peak popularity, I believe this is it..
.... Unless Niantic the fixes the (currently broken) in-game tracking system/adds a massive update like extra features and the second generation

16-07-31,4vi9qq,Line Corp earnings report and introduction ($LN),"Line Corp is a major internet business, most popular in Japan, that was the biggest American [IPO](http://fortune.com/2016/07/14/line-ipo-ln-stock/) this year. Their [mission](http://linecorp.com/en/company/mission) is ""closing the distance"", to bring people, information, and services closer together.

Line Corp posted a profit in its first [earnings report](http://linecorp.com/en/ir/highlight) since its IPO a couple weeks ago when it raised $1.3 billion from investors in Japan and the United States. Revenue grew [19.8%](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-line-results-idUSKCN1070OK). In its biggest markets of Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, and Indonesia, users grew 20.8%.

In those 4 markets, there is a population of 500 million, and Line's CEO thinks they can reach [70-80%](http://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Coming-in-five-years-the-Line-economic-bloc) by specializing in each locale's needs. In Thailand's capital, Line users can now order lunch via the app. In Indonesia, where there are lifelong bonds to schoolmates, Line has created a search service to help users find their former classmates. 

Line Corp is owned by Naver Corp from South Korea. According to [Alexa](http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/naver.com), Naver is ranked #51 globally in the top websites. It is #1 in South Korea. Google is #1 globally. Baidu is #4, and #1 in China. Reddit is #26.

What is [Naver.com](http://www.naver.com/)? It is a search portal, like Google and Yahoo. It was started around the same time as Google. Besides search, it also provides services like email. In [2015](http://www.obandigital.com/gb/blog/2015/01/30/why-google-cant-dominate-search-in-south-korea/), Naver was more popular than Google in South Korea, with 49.75% of the market, versus Google's 36.9%.

In 2009, Naver expanded to Japan, after merging with a popular gaming portal [Hangame](http://www.hangame.com/) in 2000 forming NHN Corp. The Japanese arm of that business also manages an ISP and blog platform, [Livedoor](http://www.livedoor.com/). In 2011 was the devastating Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami that damaged telecommunications in Japan, forcing people to rely on the Internet for communication.

NHN Japan engineers responded with Line, a communications app, and a year and a half later it had 100 million users. In 2013, Line Corporation was formed. Line Corp in Japan now houses Line app, Naver Japan, and Livedoor. Hangame develops games under the Line brand. NHN and Line Corp also have Line Plus Corp, whose task is to expand and develop overseas markets.

Line Corp has several apps on the [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/line-corporation/id359067226) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=LINE+Corporation) stores, many of which are games. But they are also trying things like [Line Pay](http://line.me/en/pay), and Line Mobile.

[Line Mobile](http://linecorp.com/en/pr/news/en/2016/1290) is a MVNO cell carrier. Roughly half of Japan is without a smartphone. Line Corp aims to change that. Their cell service will offer unlimited communication using the Line app, Facebook, and Twitter. In addition, unlimited music streaming and other popular content will be free. Plans will start at 500 yen, which is $4.89 per month.

Line Corp employs [3K](https://www.google.com/finance?cid=1021466631548130) people, and has [offices](http://linecorp.com/en/company/contact) in the USA, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia, and Spain. Here is a picture of the [skyscraper](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Shibuya_HIKARIE_2012-11.jpg) where they do some [business](http://static.line.naver.jp/line_corp_v1/images/im_t_pc_teamnroles.jpg) in Japan.

The Line messaging app is full of features, and has [220 million](http://www.statista.com/statistics/327292/number-of-monthly-active-line-app-users/) monthly active users. Compare that to Twitter, which has [313 million](http://www.statista.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/).

Besides having access to a huge search portal, games, ISP, blogs, and IM, they also have a music streaming service, and a very strong brand of characters like Disney. Here is a [screenshot](https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/screenshot-linecorp.com-2015-02-25-15-08-20.png) from Line Taxi, a way to get a ride like Uber, thanks to a partnership with Nihon Kotsu and its 23,000 taxis.

All this stuff lives in the Line app, where it is the center of people's world.

Line Corp is profitable. They have services like [Line Out](http://line.me/en/call) to call telephones, which is like Skype Out. They have a [creator's market](https://creator.line.me/en/), where you can create stickers and themes to get paid as people buy them. They also have a booming advertising business, where big companies are paying to reach users of the Line apps.

In this [last quarter](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-27/line-posts-a-profit-in-its-first-report-card-since-global-ipo), ad sales jumped 76% in the first half since last year. Sticker sales grew 14%. Games and music fell 5% in revenue. In total there was 2.56 billion yen of net income in the 6 months through June.

The CEO, Takeshi Idezawa, was CEO of Livedoor, and on the board of directors of NHN Japan. He's taking Line from messaging to a ""life platform"". The chairman of the board is Hae Jin Lee, who is a billionaire and founder of Naver. The CFO, In Joon Hwang, is also part of Naver.

If you listen to the CEO, he's thinking in terms of mobile being the new center of people's lives. Line is the 2nd generation of the internet portal, but instead of information like a website, they're thinking of life services. They are focused on localized needs, and providing all the services people want for their real lives. That's communication between people, but also communication between consumers and local businesses, taxis, payments, internet and phone service, home delivery of food, games, music, internet-enabled appliances, etc.

Their quarterly earnings report says 2,866 million yen net income. When I convert that to USD I get $28,047,169.35. It says 209,992,000 outstanding shares.

$28,047,169.35 net income / 209,992,000 shares = **$0.13 EPS**

The stock is at $36.72.

$36.72 share price / $0.13 EPS = **282 P/E**",32
