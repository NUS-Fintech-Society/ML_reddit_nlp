Question about collars,"Presuming TSLA stock is going to sink with the announcement and then again after what are basically promised to be shit earnings, I want to protect the gains I've made so far. Been reading a ton but am still an options virgin. I thought I'd have until Wednesday and I'm unsure what the correct play is atm:  

1) Set up a collar. Is this a common thing to do? Is it even doable with less than 100 shares (I'm at 75)? Do people tend to use limit or market orders? How far out should you pick for an expiration date? Is there a point to placing the order pre-market... If the stock tanks immediately on market open, it's safe to assume my limits wont trigger orders, so should I have set this up on Friday during the day, aka am I already too late? (TD. Was looking at 12 AUG - 227 P and 237 C. cost about $150)

2) Close position and re-open Thursday; eat capital gains.  

3) Do nothing. Ride it out.  

Anyway, looking at this as a learning experience. I'm sure some of this is personal preference, but maybe there is one strat that people favor or particularly avoid... Any tips appreciated (other than how silly it is to own TSLA, lol). Tysm.",11

16-08-01,4vlo1o,"CBL &amp; Associates priced on 59% discount to estimated NAV","CBL's stock price (CBL) jumped nearly 12% on Friday after the REIT announced a 23% increase in EPS, a 9.3% increase in adjusted funds from operations (FFO) and a big rise in occupancy.  At the same time the company raised full year guidance for full year FFO of $2.77 to $2.81 -- pricing the company on a FFO multiple of around 4.40x.

The most interesting statistic however is the debt to total asset value which was 48.3%.  With debt of $4.54bn, this figure implies a total asset value of c.$9.4bn. Deducting debt and other liabilities (including preferred debt) implies a NAV of $3.9bn or $19.57 per share. Almost 60% higher than the current $12.29 stock price.

16-08-01,4vm78v,Skechers - at half the price of a year ago the risk reward ratio is looking good,"Investors looking for a good entry point for a fast growing stock may want to consider Skechers (SKX).

The company saw its stock price drop by around 55% from 52 week highs and dropped 22% last Friday following ""disappointing"" second quarter earnings.

I place the disappointing in parenthesis as these things are all relative, especially when the company reported record second quarter sales of $877.8 million up 9.7% on 2015 and net earnings in the first six months of $171.7 million compared to $135.9 million in the same period last year.

It is true that net earnings for the second quarter dropped to $74.1 million from $79.8 million for the second quarter of 2015. However the figure was negatively impacted by several factors including foreign currency translation and exchange losses of $8.3 million, additional VAT taxes in Brazil of $2.7 million and a fire in its Malaysia warehouse, which resulted in a pre-tax loss of approximately $0.9 million. Excluding these ""once off"" factors earnings would have risen 7.8%.  Additionally, as expected, in the domestic wholesale business, shipments had been pulled forward from April into March, resulting in significantly reduced shipments in April and a sales decrease of 5.4 percent in the second quarter.  This is partly why first quarter were off the scale with sales growth of 27.4% and EPS growth of 57.1% - but for a real indication of how the company is foing I thing its better to look at the 6 month EPS increase of 26.5%.

Looking at the numbers the company is now trading on a trailing PE of around 14.0 and forward PE of 11.2 compared to peers such as Nike and Under Armour on forward PEs of 20.1 and 50.6 respectively despite much faster forecast annual growth rate of 20% for SKX compared to Nike 13.4%.

This is a company that has seen sales grow from $1.56bn in 2012 to $3.15bn in 2015 and continue to grow by almost 10% in the second quarter 2016.

Investors looking for a good entry point may looks past the numerous once off items in the latest annual report and very marginal miss of targets and decide that at half the price of a year ago the risk reward ratio is looking good.

Please be aware of elevated risks of investing in stocks.  This does not represent investment advice to buy or sell.

16-08-01,4vmjx8,"A Midsummer's Day Dream","In a dream, cause and effect are blurred and the passage of time slinks out from its normal, chronological confines. Dreams create an element of surprise that's often echoed in reality, like how time has somehow quickened, bringing August far too swiftly.

The credit markets have, too, been chimerical, taking cues from the dream-like script where things are not always as they seem. Reality has belied expectations from past experience:

* 1) Crude has been selling off, yet the broader HY market has gained 2.6% month-to-date

* 2) Credit spreads are tightening, yet curves are flattening in the EUR bond market

* 3) Summer slowdown should be in full effect, yet trading volumes are setting record highs for July


But breaking down each point above, the market has not entirely escaped logic and bonds aren’t just giddily gliding through the post-Brexit regime where yield is scarce and monetary stimulus is abundant. Beneath the hood we find:

* 1) The broader HY market has remained fairly resilient to the crude sell-off, but not without significant pressure on HY E&amp;P bonds, losing 4% and widening by 110bp since mid-July. While lower crude imposes a tactical risk on the broader HY market, the magnitude of oil's impact should be lower as investor distress and HY's beta to oil is also lower than in late 2015/early 2016. Strategically, we remain constructive on HY Energy as the recent weakness in oil could reinforce producer discipline in 2017. 

* 2) EUR bond spreads are tighter and curves are flatter whereas the inverse relationship is normally true. However, the curve flattening is not driven by an escalation of front-end risk, but rather an outperformance in longer-dated bonds, especially in the EUR IG market where there was already a limited supply of duration and ECB purchases have only made that scarcer.

* 3) HY and IG secondary trading volumes have resisted the summer slowdown, with a record activity in July ($24.1bn daily average volume vs. $17.3bn historically for the month). Despite the near-term pick up, liquidity is still structurally constrained where the cost of warehousing and intermediating secondary risk is still higher than pre-crisis norms.

16-08-01,4vn2sa,Future of coffee price,"I recently saw an TA on the coffee which suggested we might have price bottom in the US coffee index. Shortly explained: the coffee price has had an history of bear markets lasting about 4-6 years. The graph indicates that the price took support, after a five year long bear trend, on a major support level around 120 in the beginning of 2016 and more recently is breaking through another support level at 140. MA200 and MA50 (daily) also posted a golden cross in June this year. 

More fundamentally: the climate changes are forcing coffee farmers to grow beans on higher ground due to the lower temperature there, this means the land mass suitable for growing coffee is diminishing and farmers are switching to cocoa which tolerates higher temperatures better. This should also work in favor of raising the price of coffee, and since more or less every adult is deep in their coffee addiction I don't see many people stop drinking it even if the price should rise.

16-08-01,4vn87g,"With historic annual EPS growth of 16.8%, significant tailwinds and a trailing PE ratio of 18.30 investors may want to take another look at Hexcel.","Hexcel Corporation is a leading advanced composites company. It was founded in 1946 to produce honeycomb for military bombers and, in its noteable history, produced the lunar struts for the Apollo 11 lunar landing module.  Today the company develops, manufactures and markets lightweight, high-performance structural materials, including carbon fibers, reinforcements, prepregs, matrix systems, adhesives and composite structures, used in commercial aerospace, space and defense and industrial applications such as wind turbine blades.

Hexcel reported second quarter results on July 20th in what was another record quarter with diluted EPS of $0.70 increasing 11% from last year’s $0.63, operating income increased to $100.1 million from $90.6 million and sales of $522.6 million were 9.9% higher.

Commercial Aerospace sales, which account for 70% of total sales, drove the quarter’s record results.  Sales, led by the A350 XWB, were 14.3% higher in constant currency than the second quarter of 2015. Space &amp; Defense sales were 7.6% lower in constant currency than last year, while Industrial sales were 14.4% higher in constant currency than last year, reflecting the acquisition of Formax.

Looking ahead CEO Mr. Stanage raised 2016 guidance with EPS forecast between $2.48 to $2.56 (previously was $2.44 to $2.56) on sales of $1.99 to $2.05 billion (previously was $1.97 to $2.07 billion). 

The company has seen favourable tailwinds in its major markets and noteable in commercial aerospace where composite materials make up an increasing proportion of aviation components and as rising inccomes in emerging markets have led to significant increase in the demand for air travel.

According to IATA, global air passenger traffic grew by 7.4% in 2015 with 6.2% growth forecast for 2016.  2015 saw the strongest growth the industry has seen since 2010 and was driven by 5.3% growth in North America (4.0% projected for 2016), 6.0% in Europe (4.9% projected for 2016), and 10.1% in Asia-Pacific (8.5% projected for 2016).

The long term outlook is equally rosey with Boeing and Airbus enjoying an unprecedented expansion in airliner demand. Both companies raised their 20 year outlooks in the run up to the Farnborough Airshow in the UK this month.  Boeing has forecast that airlines will require nearly 40,000 jetliners between 2016 and 2035, an increase of 5% over its 2015 expectation while Airbus raised its outlook to 33,000. 

Hexcel looks well placed to benefit from these trends and has reiterated it 2020 vision for $3 billion in sales and $4.50 in EPS. Nick Stanage said during the second quarter earnings meeting that he felt very confident in the $4.50 earnings per share target for 2020.

This is not advice to buy or sell. High level of associated risk.

ONVO's current price is ~4.30 and their PR says they will move to Nasdaq GM. Given that they must maintain 4.00 through ER to make the move to Nasdaq the following day, would you consider this a bullish signal? If the company was at all worried about the market reaction to ER, surely they would not have scheduled these two events so closely together.

* The companies have agreed to the merger at a ratio of 0.11 shares of TSLA per SCTY share.
* This ratio won't be changing, barring another company making an offer on the company.
* With the first two points being true, SCTY is now basically unofficially tied to TSLA stock.  As an SCTY long, I should want to see TSLA stock gain so my existing holdings will be worth more when it converts to TSLA in my account if I hold until the transaction closes.
* Because of point three, the price of SCTY for people already in a long position only matters if you plan to exit the position.  People staying through the close of the deal should simply multiply their SCTY * 0.11, drop the remainder, and apply the TSLA current price to see the value of the position.
* Buying more SCTY would be advantageous as long as you believe that [Price Of SCTY]/0.11 is less than you believe TSLA will be at the close of the transaction in Q4.
* The market should hold SCTY and TSLA within that 0.11 ratio, as if the ratio gets too far out of that range, it creates a buy or sell opportunity, self-regulating to the agreed purchase ratio.

# Description
McDonald's Corporation (McDonald's) operates and franchises McDonald's restaurants. The Company's restaurants serve a locally-relevant menu of quality food and drinks sold at various price points in over 100 countries. 

Now it ain't all their restaurants, and the franchisee in Tokyo and in Latin America is listed on a stock exchange, so I've put them in the analysis too. In fact a third of their revenues is from franchisees.

## Recent financials 

When they spoke about full year results they showed a very different perspective on a reported based and on a ""constant currency"" basis. Effectively the strong dollar has not been helping.

&gt; Consolidated revenues decreased 7% (increased 3% in constant currencies). Consolidated operating income decreased 10% (flat in constant currencies). Diluted earnings per share was flat (increased 10% in constant currencies).

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $25.4bn | $27.4bn | $28.1bn | $27.6bn | $27.0bn|
|Net income | $4.5bn | $4.8bn | $5.6bn | $5.5bn | $5.5bn|
|EPS | $4.80 | $4.82 | $5.55 | $5.36 | $5.27|

## Competition

In their recent filing, firstly
&gt; The Company competes on the basis of price, convenience, service, menu variety and product quality in a highly fragmented global restaurant industry.

Then in terms of the market itself:

&gt; The global ""Informal Eating Out"" segment was composed of approximately 8 million outlets and generated $1.2 trillion in annual sales in 2014. McDonald’s Systemwide 2014 restaurant business accounted for 0.5% of those outlets and 7.2% of the sales. 

More importantly if we go back 5 years of financial filings:

&gt; (With) approximately 6.3 million outlets and generated $868 billion in annual sales in 2009, McDonald’s Systemwide 2009 restaurant business accounted for approximately 0.5% of those outlets and about 8% of the sales.

So the market's grown 7%, the number of restaurants is up 5%, but McDonald's is having a tough time keeping pace.

Even with this backdrop it's hard to beat their margins!

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $130.29 for McDonald's Corporation and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 11% to their target.

# Valuation

Even after all the ""poisonous"" press Chipotle is still the darling of the sector. $YUM is giving MackyD's a run for its money in valuation and growth. Though the Burger King owner (QSR) is even more respected. (Is that the Buffett touch?)

You've really got to look at one the sector's minnows, to find high growth at low valuations, and that comes with risk of management messing up.

As for the Franchisee, I don't get their valuations at all. Why would I pay twice the valuation for $ARCO than $MCD?

# Dividends
McDonald's Corporation is forecast to pay a dividend of $3.64 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $3.52 per share. The forecast dividend of $3.64 compares to a forecast EPS of $5.57. 

Furthermore the company's been buying back stock like there is no tomorrow! So much so the ""equity"" on the balance sheet's shrunk from $14 to $7bn in 5 years. If they are not careful, they'll run out of shares to buy back!

From the latest earnings call

&gt; Relative to our capital structure, 2016 represents the final year of our three-year $30 billion cash returned to shareholders target. Through June 2016, the cumulative cash returned under our three-year target stands at $24.4 billion, and we are on track to complete the remaining amount during the back half of this year.

So what happens when that's done? Is one of the key benefits gone?

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -8% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 0%. That's against a backdrop on a 2% decline in sales in the last 6 months.

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/mcd/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers. The CFO said:
&gt; We've delivered positive results over the last four quarters, not just from improving efficiency and working to reduce costs, but, most importantly, from top-line growth as we've made strides improving the customer experience. We're actively refranchising restaurants, building stronger G&amp;A discipline, and returning more cash to shareholders. The strategic changes we're making and the actions we've taken over the course of the last year are positioning us to optimize our business operations and deliver sustained, profitable growth.

What it seems to be is that they are happy to increase the number of franchises. This means someone else is sharing the risk with them, and hopefully that partner is willing to pay up in fees and invest their capital. Perhaps in the same way that Coca-Cola is a syrup company with lots of partner distributors, perhaps McDonald's can move the same way? 

Still, I can only imagine this initiative takes a lot of time to negotiate and manage. And in the meantime, what's going to happen at the end of the current buyback initiative. 

So if you are looking for growth or value, then you probably aren't *lovin' it*, are you? 

Aside: maybe they need to look at $SBUX a little, who's investing heavily in loyalty programs? There is an *Arch Card* but can $MCD create a new type of loyalty like $SBUX has?

16-08-02,4vpotz,On the beaten path of becoming a Stockbroker.,"I started my internship to become a stockbroker today. While I'm extremely excited for this opportunity  (internship, then a job at the firm after passing exams), it is unfortunately unpaid. So I am trying to finish studying for the series 7 as fast as I can since I took an obvious pay cut leaving one job for the internship. 

I was wondering if anyone who has already passed the series 7 (as well as the 63 if possible) has any pointers or recommendations for studying and passing the exam. 

Little background. 25, fast learner, been working over a decade now, 5 years of sales expierence (real sales expierence, not that nonsense people claim to have when working at a retail store)that includes cold calling out of the phonebook, tired of working jobs where I have to check to check or kill myself between 2 jobs just to be able to pay bills and still save some type of money, and I have the gift of gab  (family used to call me the mayor when I was a kid because I didn't shut the hell up).

Any advice would be awesome. Just hope I'm posting this in the correct section, my apologies if I'm not.

- ETF B 25%

I'd like to have automatic deposit.

When funds become available, the service would buy more according to the set allocations (rebalancing/re-investing).

I'm currently doing this manually with Robinhood, so I'm just trying to see if there is a better way:

I do some spreadsheet math to figure out how many shares of each ETF I can buy according to how much cash is available and what % allocation I want.  Then I go through each ETF and place the buy orders (commission free).  Its not terribly complicated, but it would be nice to just set-and-forget.

16-08-02,4vqjh9,"Leveraged Portfolio Progress - August 1, 2016","Last month, I posted [my leveraged ETF portfolio that I started on June 1](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/4qmtpi/leveraged_portfolio_june_progress/).  It's time for another update, so here it is.

[Positions as of today, August 1](http://i.imgur.com/ug5MPEF.jpg)  
and  
[Analysis of portfolio](http://i.imgur.com/cnTUmON.jpg)

On June 1, I made the initial outlay of $4,972.64 and the current value is $5,495.59.  This gives a gain of $522.95, or a 10.52% gain.  Not bad for 2 months *that included Brexit volatility*!  For comparison, since June 1, SPY has returned 3.37% and the Vanguard moderate growth fund (60/40 stocks/bonds) has returned 2.18%.  Brexit was a great test of this portfolio, and I only had a minor drawdown during Brexit of -4.36%.  By contrast, SPY had a drawdown of -5.52%.  

So far, this portfolio is roughly as volatile as SPY, but generating 3x the returns.  Not bad.    

The 3x bond portion is growing a bit faster than the other positions, but its not in re-balance territory just yet since every position is up.  I'm still trying to find a way to adjust the bond leverage and move closer to 2x as interest rates continue to fall, but I'll keep working on that.  It's worth noting that I also received some dividends from this portfolio, but they only amounted to a few bucks.  If you did this with more money, the dividends would probably pay your transaction fees for re-balancing.  Alternative, something like RH could be a good place for a strategy like this, since you can buy partial shares (ensuring exact portfolio balance) and rebalance for free. 

I know you guys are busy blowing your student loan money on UWTI and shit, but here is something else for you to lose money on. ",27

16-08-02,4vpteh,The KDJ Indicator?,"Today I just learned about the kdj indicator after tinkering with technicals in Google finance as I'm trying to learn about new analysis tools in charts. I know that the indicator is an extension of the stochastic oscillator, and that the only difference is the J. What really surprised me is how the J can determine if a stock price is overbought or undersold. As soon as I learned that and used it on a stock that I screened today, it blew my mind! It's extremely useful for getting in a stock at the bottom, or in at a low price. BUT, I have a few questions.
1) Should I use the ""J"" as a trustworthy indicator to get in a stock while it's low? Is it that accurate?
2) I don't know anything about the stochastic osscilator, and at this point I'm just focused on the J, but what exactly are K and D measuring? That part I'm confused on, right now I'm just focused on the J. 
3) Do you use this indicator to determine getting in a stock at the right price? Am I doing this right? Is the KDJ indicator a good tool to use that actually determines when to get in a stock when it's undersold?

There's been a lot of positive activity in particular over the last two days, pushing the price from 2.35 to 2.90 which is the highest it's been since October 2013. There's an earnings release this Thursday. Is that usually a good sign to hold onto my shares longer? 

[An article says:](http://smallcapexclusive.com/amarin-corporation-plc-adr-nasdaqamrn-shares-advance-ahead-earnings-release/)

&gt; Share prices have been trading in a 52-week range of $1.24 to $2.75 so price is near the resistance at this point.

What does resistance mean in this context? That it's as high as it'll go? Or something different?

The brief backstory is that I received a panicked call from a family member last night, stating that I need to immediately move my money from BOA to a credit union because of the threat of a government bail-in.  


I thought perhaps I heard incorrectly or that possibly this was a scare tactic, however, upon doing a bit of research, it appears that a government bail-in is, in fact, a thing.  My understanding of it is, if the bank I'm using is facing failure, it can liquidate my savings and issue me an IOU/equity/stock in lieu of cash.  Obviously, if true, this is alarming.  

Please give me your thoughts and opinions about this.  I'm interested in hearing the perspectives of my fellow investor redditors.  

The paragraph below is an excerpt from this:  
[https://www.fdic.gov/about/srac/2012/gsifi.pdf]

""13. An efficient path for returning the sound operations of the G-SIFI to the private sector would be provided by exchanging or converting a sufficient amount of the unsecured debt from the original creditors of the failed company into equity. In the U.S., the new equity would become capital in one or more newly formed operating entities. In the U.K., the same approach could be used, or the equity could be used to recapitalize the failing financial company itself—thus, the highest layer of surviving bailed-in creditors would become the owners of the resolved firm. In either country, the new equity holders would take on the corresponding risk of being shareholders in a financial institution. Throughout, subsidiaries (domestic and foreign) carrying out critical activities would be kept open and operating, thereby limiting contagion effects. Such a resolution strategy would ensure market discipline and maintain financial stability without cost to taxpayers.""

Its phase 3 clinical trials (ANNEXA-A and ANNEXA-R) preliminary results look very promising. FDA will be looking at its application in the coming weeks and make the decision by end of month.

Some background: Xa inhibitors are a new class of anticoagulants that came onto market late 2000's (started with Rivaroxaban/Xarelto, then Apixaban/Eliquis, and most recently Edoxaban/Savayza). It has a lot of benefits over currently available anticoagulants, namely warfarin (require frequent monitoring and has a lot of drug/drug and drug/food interaction) and Dabigatran/Pradaxa (no monitoring required, but has higher risk of GI bleeeding compared to the other anticoagulants). Xa inhibitors does not require monitoring and are the safety profile are better than that of warfarin and Pradaxa, making them a very attractive choice for physicians and patients. The only down side at this time is that they do not have a specific antidote to reverse it if bleeding do occur (KCentra among other things for warfarin; and Praxbind for Pradaxa). So the approval of Andexanet alfa will be HUGE for Portola if everything goes well :)",7

In connection with this offering, we, our directors and executive officers and stockholders
currently representing substantially all of the outstanding shares of our common stock will agree with

shares of our common stock outstanding after this offering will be restricted from immediate resale in
accordance with the terms of such lock-up agreements without the prior written consent of Goldman,

16-08-02,4vtmpb,AMRN DD (part 3),"I was going to wait until Thursday’s Earnings Report to post part 3, but with the price and volume action from the past 3 trading days it appears something big is happening. It's not letting me link my past posts because I'm a fucking retard, so check my history for part 1 and part 2.  
  

  
  
  

**Things to note:**  
Thursday premarket Earnings Report release and Conference Call  
Price is setting new 52-week highs  
Average Volume the past year has been around 1Mil shares/Day  
The past three days have reached 10X the average volume – with no news reported  
The past three days the price has gone up around 30%  
  
  
**Why it’s happening? (Speculating – pick one):**  
1.	A partner is about to be announced sometime during the CC  
2.	A date has been set by the DMC to review Interim Data  
3.	Hedgefunds and big investors are starting to buy, in anticipation of great results  
  
  
**Earnings Report:**  
I’m expecting revenue between 29-31 million  
Important to pay attention to cash on hand. Hopefully +60 million  
Other than that the CC is typically boring, unless they discuss anything Reduce-IT related. Most likely say the same thing they’ve been saying for months (“Reduce-IT Interim results are tracking for a September-October readout”).  
  
  
**Random:**  
Since my first post, the price has gained around 90%, I still expect a gap up to 5-7s as we get closer to Interim results.   
Management letting cash get this low, proves that they have some faith the trial will be stopped early for overwhelming efficacy.

I decided to use primary Robinhood for my long positions and my other Robinhood for my riskier/~~short~~ SWING positions. About a month ago I ~~attempted~~, ~~on the recomendation of wsb~~, ~~because gold has to go down sometime, right!?~~, bought $4200 worth of a $DUST ~~that I had watched/traded quite a bit already~~, ~~that I knew very little about~~ that I was an expert on. The trade went through just fine because I know how to use my accounts.

~~Pissed that fidelity was fucking up~~, Pissed that I lost $300 in one day, I decided to buy $1000 more worth of $DUST.

Fast forward to today. I open my multiple Robinhood accounts(I now have 6 because diversity) to do some research and there is negative $150+ in all my accounts, WTF? Apparently, when I tried to buy the cancer stock, again, the stock then proceeded to tank 30% so I'm 800 dollars in the hole on a stock that should have gone up. So tomorrow i will be ~~paying a margin fee and depositing $800 to cover the cost of a stock worth $500~~ sucking Bubba's cock to make up my loss. I'm the next Warren Buffet.

16-08-02,4vv0c2,Explain to me why weekly vertical SPY spreads is a bad idea,"I've been playing with SPY calls for a bit but I've been curious about branching into other plays. It seems like people here rarely talk about spreads on SPY in comparison to just calls/puts, I was wondering if that's because I'm missing something.

Example:

* SPY is currently at ~215.50

* Buying a weekly vertical call spread at 214/214.50 costs ~0.40

* If SPY closes anywhere above 214.50 this week, I make ~0.50 = ~25% profit

Considering we've been sideways for a bit now, my question is why don't people just bank on SPY not tanking and raking in a ""safer"" ~25%/week (or more if you're bullish and buy an ATM/OTM spread) instead of fighting theta decay? I mean obviously if SPY tanks, I lose everything, but isn't that a similar deal with regular calls? It's Tuesday today so there's still a full 3 days of uncertainty, but I remember last Thursday a similarly ITM spread was about 0.40 too.

Is the only reason that it seems like spreads are more unpopular because there's limited reward % for similar risk %? Legitimately curious if I'm just retarded.",5

# Description
Carnival is a cruise company and provides vacations to cruise destinations throughout the world. 

## Recent financials 

Looking at their financials I am immediately annoyed by the presence of ""Adjusted EPS"", which unsurprisingly has been higher than EPS for each of the last 5 years. Also, it's remarkable how big the capex is every year, Over $2bn. Wow. That's a lotta boat. Other items that stand out are their need to highlight lots of FX rates, the price of oil, and the efficiency of their oil usage. Though am glad to see that passenger numbers continue to grow!

## Competition
From their filings:

&gt; We compete with land-based vacation alternatives throughout the world, such as hotels, resorts (including all-inclusive resorts), theme parks, organized tours, casinos, vacation ownership properties, and other internet-based alternative lodging sites. Our principal cruise competitors are Royal Caribbean, Norwegian and MSC Cruises. Almost 90% of all 2014 global cruise guests sailed with these competitors and us.

And from an industry dynamic
&gt; The 2015 annual penetration rates when computed based on the number of annual cruise guests as a percentage of the total population are as follows: 4.0% for Australia and New Zealand, 3.4% for North America, 2.7% for the United Kingdom (“UK”) and 1.9% for continental Europe. Cruising in China is in the early stages of development. 

So it's a really consolidated sector with just 3 big players. Plus there's still rather a low penetration rate for the industry. And given aging populations, and the potential to say cruises are safer, maybe there are some pretty helpful dynamics here for CCL and it's peers.

Though, I fear that this is a rather capital intensive business. Whereas hotels can have franchises or lease the property, you sort of have to have a boat? Is that why the returns on equity are low compared to the hotel majors?

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Carnival Corp | $15,950M | 29% | 10%
Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd | $8,401M | 26% | 9%
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd | $4,484M | 27% | 14%
*Hotels* |   |   |  
Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc | $11,552M | 23% | 29%
Marriott International Inc | $14,958M | 10% | N/A
Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corp | $1,808M | 14% | 12%
Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide Inc | $5,257M | 20% | 39%
Wyndham Worldwide Corporation | $5,582M | 22% | 63%
InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (ADR) | $1,803M | 43% | N/A

## Cash / Debt?
Carnival Corp has $8,910M of net debt. That is 1.9x it's latest operating profit. Not worrisome, and given the capital they have in terms of boats, I suppose it makes sense to load the business with debt! Though perhaps that wasn't a great strategy during a recession? 

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $57.00 for Carnival Corp and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 22% to their target.

# Valuation

The Cruise sector is clearly cheaper than the major hotels. Dramatically so. Though on a free cashflow basis Some of the hotels do manage to generate a similar amount of cash.

# Dividends
Carnival Corp is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.29 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $1.25 per share. That is a 3% growth. The forecast dividend of $1.29 compares to a forecast EPS of $3.33.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -6% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -2%. That's against a backdrop of sales up 3% in the first 6 months, with reasonable demand. 

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ccl/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers.
&gt; (Signs for) the remainder of the year are very strong for our brands enabling us to raise our revenue yield expectations and affirming our conviction to deliver over 20% earnings growth this year.

Though they do go on to say that their ""return on capital"" is just 9% though they hope to get it to double digits. And they expressed confidence in their financial position which allowed them authorise a new share buyback.

Sure the geopolitical uncertainty isn't good for the travel industry, but aren't cruise ships pottering round the Caribbean insulated from that? Yes Brexit is bad with £ earnings now worth less in $. Though on the other hand, surely there is a great opportunity for secular growth in China and the rest of Asia?

At 14x earnings, it's not ridiculous a valuation, is it? Even if FX is a headwind. Though a 9% Return on Capital is the counter balance?

So...party time?

So do I make $10 for the sale + $1 for the dividend = $11 profit,

16-08-02,4vvbt5,"$NTDOY, better case for the company. Nintendo NX","[I wrote a case a week ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/4uqh8y/ntdoy_nintendo_pokemongo_nx/) for why I believe $NTDOY might be a good investment. This wasn't met with the best response, as I didn't go into much financial detail, or any evidence as to why, my own fault. Here is my re-evaluation:

Nintendo is expected to announce news of it's new console/handheld at the upcoming Gamescom in Cologne. The console is expected to be some kind of mix between a home console and transportable handheld too. We currently have no real inclination as to what this console will be, so anything is speculation. What we do know is the console will be a handheld. This is interesting.

I am basing my investment on the quality of the NX, as I believe, and I will try to prove, that the console will be the deciding factor for the health of the company over the next 2 or so years. My thesis is that with a good console, there will be a great game sales, where a majority of the income arrives from with Nintendo. 

**Nintendo Handheld History**

Nintendo has had two (ignoring slight changes, upgrades etc) real console. The Nintendo Gameboy, which was the first of it's time, and Nintendo DS. Looking at most recent history, the Nintendo DS is our most recent base point for the handheld console. Released in November 2004, the DS had over 70 million console sales in the first three years, I believe there were some early iterations, refining exactly what people wanted in regards to the console. Assuming the $150 price point for the DS, this is a return of $10.5 billion in a 3 year period. Not bad. This was also the midway point of total sales, which ended up around 140 million consoles. 

To go along with this, I was able to find a number of the total games sold for the DS. As of March 2014, a total of 943.98 million games were sold. I am assuming a cheaper end price point of $30 for the games, which gives us $28.319 billion. I understand this incorporates the entire history of the DS, so assuming a midpoint like we did with the console, lets say $14 billion turnover.  

With these two, we are looking at $24.5 billion turnover for a company that is worth $29.5 billion right now, interesting. 

**Wii**

The Wii was very similar in it's success, and if you compare the release date of the console, to the rise of the stock, we are looking at a pretty amazing price increase (from mid 20s to mid 80s in around a year). 

The Wii console boasted 44 million units shipped two years after its introduction, which again is very close to the midpoint of the total consoles sold. This, assuming a $250 price point for consoles, returned $11 billion for the company. 

I also assumed a midpoint for Wii games sales, around 450 million. Assuming a low point of $25 per game for the Wii, this equates to around $10 billion worth of sales (little underestimate). 

This puts the Wii turnover at around $22 billion at this point. 

**Together**

During a very similar time period, the Wii and DS turned over together $51.5 billion. An outstanding number for a very short time period, and is the sole reason for Nintendo's success. 

We all saw the terrible console that was the Wii U, that didn't show enough of an improvement to condone individuals to buy a complete new console, or even in turn buy the Wii U games. It was the same thing with a fancy controller. 

**Nintendo's Shareholders**

One other final point I would like to make, is the excitement factor we have seen from the release of PokemonGo. Even though Nintendo appeared to have less and less of an impact on the release of PokemonGo (all the way to zero), it was very interesting to see how the stock went up nearly 150% on nothing. I see the Nintendo shareholders as a hype group, buying exciting news, as they can see when something Nintendo produces as selling well. If the general consensus of the NX is positive, watch the price of the console rise. 

**Final**

I really am excited about the chance NX has. It is filling a two way void in one console, which if it is done correctly, could rock the console industry. Nintendo games are an anomaly in the market, as they are usually only for Nintendo consoles. The consoles sell, because you can't get the games without them. If the consoles are good, they get a great following very quickly. 

With the absence of an alternative to the underpowered Xbox One and PS4, Nintendo has an opportunity to walk into an area of the market with neither has been able to touch. 

The NX will be the thing that takes Nintendo's market share back to what it was in the late 00's. 

However, this is totally dependent on how well the Nintendo executes the final version of the NX. Both the DS and Wii received a tough first impression, but upon personal reviews and experiences, shot through the cautious first opinions. 

I am looking to Gamescon in a couple of weeks to see what the console is, but more than likely I will be picking up a position prior to the event.

16-08-02,4vvduh,TIFU by finding out I had a warrant for my arrest days before my S7,"Throw away account. Writing this as a nod towards someones possible enjoyment of my misery. Looking at the big picture there is a life lesson and a story for the grand kids. A bit of background, for the past few weeks I have been studying nonstop everyday for my Series 7. My window is open and I planned to schedule it this week.

Yesterday at work, my FINRA background check came back. My manager calls me into his office and tells me that I have a warrant out for my arrest. He promptly asks me to leave the office and places me on suspension (only, hopefully) until I get it resolved. No further information was given. 

At this point I am completely freaked out because I have no idea what this is about. If anyone has ever tried to look arrest warrants up online, it is impossible. (side note: .govs make that happen) I contacted family and friends to ""bail"" me out in the worst case scenario. 

Alright today, 9am I head into my city criminal courthouse in a suit and tie. I am asked several times where certain rooms are as if I work there. Sit for an hour. I am called to speak with the city public attorney (I did not hire private as of yet bc assumed it was a minor ticket). He tells me not only did I miss my court date (obv) but that I am being charged with petty larceny. For stealing what, you might ask? Turns out that 7 months ago, I went into a convenience store at 2am, grabbed a pack of bagels, proceeded to eat the bagels in the store, then walked out. Ignoring anyones request to pay for the bagels. While this is extremely serious, I couldn't help but have a laugh with (alone) the Public attorney. Bagels of all things. College, ami right?.

I pieced together the arrest date and some information from friends. Back in January during my final college masquerades, I woke up at a friends house after a night of drinking. He told me that I was banging on the backdoor (it was unlocked) at 4am with no shoes on during a snow storm. The next morning, I had no recollection or arrest documentation on me. Thoughts were, I quite possibly could have been mugged (no shoes), but as for being arrested I rationalized in my mind quickly that if so 1) I wouldn't have been let out and 2) They would have given me shoes, as It was in the middle of a snow storm. So I forgot about it completely. Turns out I was, and Ive had a warrant for my arrest the past 7 months. 

Moving forward, I must look like the biggest liability to my firm and I would not be surprised if they let me go (I hope not). Private representation tells me that most likely the charge will be dismissed. As for taking the test when I wanted to, I basically wasted the last month of my life studying for something I won't have sponsorship for. Im a great guy, love walks on the beach, so pray for me. 

Shout out to FINRA for making this apparent in a slightly less embarrassing way then it could have been. 

What Ive learned: 
-Always eat before you drink for two reasons 1) chances are less of suffering from severe multiple hour black outs 2) less inclined to eat the first kind of food you see.
-If in the case you do suffer a black out and no one knows where or what you did, It might be in your best interest to check at your county clerk's office, police station, or courthouse for any arrests before going through months of job training and interviewing, to possibly be let go for something so minimal. 

Edit: Some proof blacked out for obvious reasons https://imgur.com/gallery/xcIcO

TL/DR: 7 months ago arrested for eating bagels, might lose job

16-08-03,4vwc9e,"IRA advice for a novice! ETFs, Dividends, Diversification? Back door ROTH?","Well to start, I started an IRA, only $1000 right now (age 25)... but at least I'm saving! (outside of cash and stocks). I plan to add more this year as I slowly pull my money out of stocks and put them into my traditional IRA.

I had always assumed an IRA wasn't something you picked your investments in so when it came time to invest myself I did a fair amount of research. I went with 3 different ETFs that all pay dividends. I forget how my research led me to this strategy but I remember it being only moderately risky and diversified enough.

The funds have been invested since February and I've yet to see any dividend yields even though at least one ex-dividend date has passed for all three ETFs. Am I missing something?

Overall, when you research the benefits of an IRA, they generally assume 5-7% yearly gains... but isn't it entirely possible to have such a poor choice of stock picks that you lose money over a long period of time? How do you at least eliminate the risk and make it at least as safe as savings? Can you?

What is the time frame for ROTH conversions? Do I have to close my positions? Is there a fee? I want to take advantage of this in a few years. Right now my tax bracket is low but deducting traditional IRA deposits from my tax liability ends up with me getting essentially all of my paid taxes back. So it becomes a zero sum game.

16-08-02,4vvj7t,Why you should be long on SWHC - actual DD inside,"Here is my first attempt at some hopefully decent DD for you clowns.

Company: Smith &amp; Wesson
Ticker Symbol: SWHC
Current Price: $29.80
Next Earnings Announcement (estimated): 9/1/16 - After Market Close

**Earnings History**
SWHC has **beat**, *not met*, the consensus earning forecast in 12 consecutive quarters; while meeting or beating the consensus earning forecast in 21 straight quarters, 19 of which they exceeded expectations. Moving focus back to recent earnings, the last 4 quarters percent surprise on earnings has been 45.45% Q116, 25% Q216, 43.9% Q316, and most recently 22.22% Q416 when earnings were announced in June. Results for Q117 (which is April through June 2016 for you people who have to take their shoes off to count above 10) are expected to be reported 9/1/2016 with an EPS of $0.52 (originally slated for 8/25/16 but looks like that's been bumped back a week). 

Q116 (note all prices are at day close)
August 27 (announce date) - $16.22 
August 28 - $18.03 (+11.16%)
1 week out - $18.33 (+13.01%)
1 month out - $17.56 (+8.26%)

Q216
December 8 - $21.39 
December 9 - $21.64 (+1.17%)
1 week out - $23.78 (+11.17%)
1 month out - $24.11 (12.72%)

Q316
March 3 - $25.40
March 4 - $27.05 (+6.50%)
1 week out - $27.92 (+9.92%)
1 month out - $27.76 (+9.29%)

Q416
June 16 - $21.75 
June 17 - $23.65 (+8.74%)
1 week out - $25.33 (+16.46%)
1 month out - $28.35 (+30.34%)
To date (August 2) - $29.80 (37.01%)


**Current Events**
What do we get when we add the current turmoil and violence across the United States and the world with the media magnifying events pertaining to shootings, mass or not, and recent foreign and domestic terror attacks and the wake of an election that could impose major gun law restrictions? We get a much larger than average group of Americans who had not decided to pull the trigger on self protection previously, however now feel the need more than ever to protect themselves. YTD gun applications are on pace to grow by more than 19.5%. Looking from April to June, year over year weapon permit applications during the same period have increased roughly 15%, most notable June 16 when they increased by more than 30%. More gun applications mean more gun sales, albeit there are other options than SWHC it still will impact them positively nonetheless. 

[YTD Application source](http://www.clickorlando.com/news/women-among-fastest-growing-group-of-gun-owners)

**More In-depth Look**
In order to meet or beat earnings 21 straight times a company must have their financials in order. And this may be SWHC biggest strong suit yet. They have consistently shown significant YTY revenue &amp; net income growth alongside great YTY EPS growth from recent earnings. Their 2.72 current and 2.08 quick ratios totes their ability to be liquid. This is further backed by some of their recent acquisitions such as Crimson Trace and Taylor Brands, which primarily sell gun accessories and knives respectively. These recent acquisitions also show promise that SWHC is making efforts to maintain higher revenues during slower quarters due to cyclical gun sales. On paper SWHC is a very sound company from a financial standpoint.

**Recap**
If you are looking to make an upcoming earnings play, SWHC is definitely worth taking your time to look into. They are teed up for a great quater that should exceed projections. The consensus EPS for SWHC this upcoming earnings is $0.52. My projections for the reported EPS would be in the range $0.55 to $0.65 (+5.8% to +25% surprise) based on current and past financials alongside the current events that would increase sales and revenues for the quarter. ~~If~~ When earnings are exceeded, I'd expect anywhere from a 5-10% price increase immediately with potential for more growth over the following weeks. The effect of the election on this stock does scare me a little, so I wont be holding for that long after earnings. So I'm currently long on Sept16 29 calls for a few weeks now and am considering building a larger position after evaluating RGR earnings for some rough comparison on sales and revenue growth. 


tl;dr
SWHC financials are solid, previous earning history is solid, recent news is favorable, go long on SWHC now but be weary of staying in around or past the November election.

16-08-03,4vwjva,ATW earnings and conference call DD,"Introduction: Atwood oceanics is a leading offshore drilling company who has an average fleet age of 4.5 years. While posting best in industry margins and a best in industry safety in operations results as they have gone nearly two years without a single lost-time incident or reportable spill anywhere in their fleet. 

Rig summary
6 ultra deepwater (2 idle)
5 jackups (2 idle)
1 deepwater submersible (idle)

Notes on idle rigs:
Jackups- Management hopeful that they can keep one of these two rigs busy but the overall demand continues to fall as it has 5% since last earnings call. The current condition is that it will be about 45-60 days to activate these rigs and put them to work if an opportunity were to materialize


Conference call summary
They reported lower revenues (95% of projected) due to some nonrecurring repair on one rig and secured two smaller contracts while buying back bonds at around $0.75 on the dollar because they were at a huge discount to par. 

They have been focusing on the marketing to their idle rigs and have been putting a good amount of effort in their cost reduction. 

Another thing to note is that a representative from the Evercore group who has been talking with Atwoods major and potential customers over the last few months has noted that there was a small shift in tone from ""we're just not doing anything to, okay, we need to think about think about our 2017 and 2018 deepwater plans because they're going to be part of our portfolio forever"". 

 Atwood has implemented many cost reduction initiatives both on their rigs and at the onshore locations without diminishing the quality of the drilling services for their clients.

I currently have a position in ATW and don't plan to sell for the next 4-5 years

I believe the time to buy is now. Going to load up as much as possible as long as the stock stays below $40. Assuming Phelps wins a few medals and UA winter sales begin to heat up in the back end of Q3 we should see earnings pop the next few quarters. 

With Wall Street taking out 2-3x out of the P/E since Q2 earnings there is still a ton of room for the stock to grow to around $60 before 2016 earnings are revealed in January. 

Biggest risks:

Olympics have no material effect on sales winter doesn't come until mid to late 4th quarter and all of the big sponsorships (Curry, Brady, Harper, Speith and Phelps) don't lead to any increase in sales. 

If the next set of Curry shoes don't excite more of a following shoe sales could flatline leaving the stock to tank yet again. 

I think the biggest risk is that winter sales don't hit until the 4th quarter and we see marginal increases but not a huge jump in stock price or EPS. 

But I think it's more likely that the stock goes up then down at this point.

Here's to hoping I'm right! ",9
16-08-03,4vyv1w,"I have around $70k just sitting in the bank, but I don't trust the stock market. What are some risk-averse ways to invest?","I thought I might not be the only person who has this type of mindset, so it might be a good discussion. This is a throwaway.

&amp;nbsp;

Like I said in the title, I have about $70k in cash in the bank.  I am 24 years old so that is a big factor in this.  Most of it is in Ally savings for 1% interest.  At this point, I am most concerned about inflation, and that 1% seems good enough, but I know it's not great.  

&amp;nbsp;

I'm self employed, so for me, if I want more money, I work harder and make more. So when I look at the possibility and the risk involved with investing that money just to make, say 3% for 2100, I would prefer to work harder than risk losing what I have just for a small gain.  On the flip side, losing money that I've worked very hard for sucks.  I am assuming I would just invest in an index fund.  

So basically my mindset is why risk investing for a tiny return when I can just work a bit harder for a much larger return.  I know  it's illogical because I could do both, but it's just comforting to know that I have what I have.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm a total stock-newbie. I've read quite a lot, but so many books assumes you know the basics - which I sure don't. There's a ton of ""holes"" in my knowledge about how stocks work on a basic level. Let me explain:

A company wants to go public and get an evaluation of the company value. Let's say it's evaluated to $100 million. They split the value into 1 million shares, $100 each. Where do the shares go from here? How does the price start to fluctuate from here? 

I understand the whole ""well if people don't want the share, it loses value"". That makes sense. But how's the price set? Who sets the price? If a high volume is bought, who decides how much the price goes up?

If amazons stock drops 1% tomorrow, how do they manage that internally? What if it's bound in non-liquid assets within the company?

16-08-03,4vzw4z,"It been a while since I've given some TA so come and get it. (SPY)","The SPY was putting in a bullish consolidation pattern for the last 2 weeks and appeared as though it was going to make a bullish break out (somewhere FSC is looking for a refrigerator box to live in). 

-

But the 1% bullish consolidation channel on the SPY we were in for the last 2 weeks was very bullish actually but broke yesterday to the down side and produced a ""failed bullish pattern"". Today needed to be a large move to the upside to negate that but it doesn't appear to be happening as today's move up is less than 50% of yesterdays move down. It looks like we have confirmation of a shift in market sentiment and we are turning down. How long is any ones guess but short term we are going lower.

-

Today's intra-day chart is very weak... 10 min SPY is basically walking up its 20 MA (bearish signal)... very week buying so far and looks like a lull before we move down again tomorrow. Today is confirmation of a failed bullish pattern for the last 2 weeks and when these happen the move down are usually pretty big... not 10%-15% big (lets be real here) but big in that it will fall until hitting a larger support level. As we don't have any real support levels below until we hit $210 (see chart) the next pivot point support that we will trade down to before before getting a small bounce will be $212.50 as noted in the graph. After that I expect we trade down to $210 before the next major bounce or major move down.

[Intra-day chart](http://i.imgur.com/Fku2vqb.png) Showing weakness after yesterdays break down.

16-08-03,4vzx2y,India passes landmark tax reform: the GST amendment is expected to make the country one unified common market,"The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is being hailed as a very big structural reform in India, aimed at supporting organized market growth in India. [Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-03/india-passes-landmark-sales-tax-reform-in-modi-s-biggest-win-yet) is calling it ""Modi’s Biggest Win Yet"", and to quote [The Financial Express](http://www.financialexpress.com/fe-columnist/gst-bill-passed-by-rajya-sabha-india-is-finally-one-country-with-one-tax/337546/): ""_India is finally one country with one tax!_"".

A short summary for the market watchers:

* Currently, a good is taxed multiple times at different rates in different states. The GST is a single tax on the supply of goods and services, which will replace at least 17 state and federal levies.

* GST would make doing business easier and tax neutral, irrespective of which state the business is being done. It will dismantle the inter-state barriers, and make the movement of goods faster and cheaper across a market of 1.3 billion consumers.

* GST implementation will not be a single event: the full roll-out will take a couple of years.

* The Government has not announced the final GST rate, but analysts are predicting a standard rate of 17-18%.

* Some analysts are saying that the short-term impact on the stock markets is already priced-in; others are predicting a short spike.

* In the long-term, the GST is expected to have a highly positive impact on the country's stock markets (and economy in general).

* Many companies are expecting cost savings from lower inter-state transfer octroi, lower transit times, warehouse rationalization, lower inventory-carrying costs, easier compliance, online payments, less paperwork and reduction in overall tax rates.

* Industries expecting substantial benefits include Automobiles, Cement, FMCG, Logistics, Manufacturing, Multiplexes, exporters and companies competing with the unorganized sector.

Wash sales are defined as selling a security at a loss when you buy shares before or after of that same security. (If I am wrong, please correct me).

If I keep the original shares (FIFO) and sell the second lot of shares (Highest/LIFO) how and why is this defined as a wash sale?



I thought original shares would be the first lot, thus selling the first lot (out of the two) would create a wash sale?

Why does selling the second lot out, the higher one create a wash adjusted price (higher), on my first lot. My first lot was 10 dollars for 10 shares. After wash adjustment, my first lot on July 20th of 10 dollars a share is now 10.5 dollars.

# Description
Level 3 Communications, Inc. is a provider of a range of integrated communications services. They don't serves us pesky humans directly, but offer transport and fiber services, colocation and data center services, data services, security services and voice services. You could say they are a telco's telco.


## Recent financials 

Now, with a couple of recent acquisitions the numbers are a little juiced, but that said, for a ""utility"" industry, it's hard not to admire their growth, though don't be fooled by the mega EPS for 2015, that included a multi-billion tax benefit.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $8.2bn | $6.8bn | $6.3bn | $6.4bn | $4.3bn|
|Operating income | $1.3bn | $1.0bn | $0.7bn | $0.6bn | $0.1bn|
|EPS | $9.58 | $1.21 | -$0.49 | -$1.96 | -$5.51|

Sure we can see that total assets have bloomed, but so has stockholder's equity.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Total assets | $24bn | $21bn | $13bn | $13bn | $13bn|
|Long term debt | $11bn | $11bn | $8bn | $9bn | $8bn|
|Shareholders Equity | $10bn | $6bn | $1bn | $1bn | $1bn|


## Competition

From their latest filing they point out:

&gt; The communications industry has been and remains highly competitive. In the late 1990s and the early 2000s, significant new capacity was deployed by both existing and new entrants. This oversupply led to a period of financial restructuring and industry consolidation. Given the significant economies of scale inherent in the communications industry, we believe further consolidation may occur such as Verizon’s recently announced acquisition of XO.

They then go on to make pretty much any major firm in the entire telecom and infrastructure world as significant competitors. See you yourself:

&gt; Verizon, AT&amp;T, XO, NTT, Tata, Cogent, BT, Orange, TeliaSonera, Telefonica, Telmex, CenturyLink, Zayo, Vodafone, Colt, Interoute, KPN, Belgacom, Equinix, Terremark, CoreSite, Global Switch, InterXion, Telecity, Telehouse Europe, IBM, Akamai Technologies, Limelight Networks, Amazon, Edgecast Networks, Fastly, CDNetworks, Cloudflare, Deutsche Telekom.

If you're a telco and you aren't on the list. Piff!

Looking at the stats, $LVLT is doing pretty good on both margins and returns. Sure it may not be a mega-player, but it's clearly a smart operator.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Level 3 Communications, Inc. | $8,222M | 32% | 42%
Verizon Communications Inc. | $130,115M | 35% | 94%

## Cash / Debt?

Level 3 Communications, Inc. has $9,587M of net debt. That is 3.7x its latest operating profit. So you can see it's on the risky end of leverage. Do I worry? Not really, telcos seem to be good as signing multi year deals, and as everyone knows once you've got the infrastructure in place, don't even dream of changing it!


# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $60.67 for Level 3 Communications, Inc. and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 24% to their target. Which piques my interest...

# Valuation

... until I get to a 29x PE ratio. Okay, I like double-digit growth. But this is a telco, not Amazon AWS! Just look at $LVLT versus $CTL. Same market value, same margin, but one has twice the sales (albeit at no growth).

# Dividends

Level 3 Communications, Inc. is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. I can't imagine they'll offer one anytime soon, as if they're hunch is right, it would be better to go on consolidating the industry!

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -5% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -6%. That's against a backdrop of flat sales growth in the last 6 months.

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/lvlt/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers.

&gt; Because of our ongoing focus on profitable revenue growth, combined with our continued disciplined cost management, we remain confident and are reiterating our adjusted EBITDA outlook of 10% to 12% growth, and we continue to expect to generate free cash flow of $1 billion to $1.1 billion.

That's impressive, looking back to 2015, where they grew EBITDA by 16% and generated free-cashflow of $658m. But how much is a company that's generating over a $1bn in FCF worth? A company who's cost of debt is circa 5%. 

So maybe this telco isn't boring after all. But for the wrong reason. :(

16-08-03,4w14i1,Tesla revenue and earnings miss expectations.Again.,"Tesla (TSLA) Q2 financial results are out and the numbers look a little light.

The electric car company reported revenue of $1.56 billion, falling short of analysts’ expectation for $1.63 billion. This came with a big net loss of $1.06 per share, which was much wider than the $0.60 loss expected.

Importantly, Tesla delivered 14,402 vehicles — 9,764 Model S and 4,638 Model X — during the quarter, which was about in line with expectations.

Tesla’s management has been criticized for over-promising while under-delivering. In its Q1 earnings announcement, management blamed “hubris” for causing production delays. Still, the company didn’t hesitate that it would ramp up production to achieve what RBC analyst Joseph Spak characterized as “a complex manufacturing ramp the likes of which we don’t believe has ever been seen before.""

""Based on … progress, vehicle production is now on track to support about 50,000 deliveries in the second half of this year, with automotive gross margin improvement,” management said on Wednesday.

“Vehicle production efficiency is improving rapidly and we are now increasing our weekly production rate even further. Barring any further supply constraints, we plan to exit Q3 with a steady production rate of 2,200 vehicles per week, and plan to increase production to 2,400 vehicles per week in Q4.”

Lately, there has been no shortage of controversy swirling around the car company and its charismatic CEO Elon Musk. From its SolarCity acquisition to its autopilot feature.

16-08-04,4w21fy,What accounts should I be maxing out first as sole proprietor?,"Hi! I got no help in PF, so I thought maybe someone here can advise... 

I'm trying to become more responsible with finances, read everything about retirement accounts recently, but I can't find advice on this particular question:

What savings/retirement accounts should I start maxing out first as a sole proprietor if my goal is looking very long-term, and retirement by 60 with the most cash in the end (I'm 27, not married)?

Is it Solo 401k, then SEP IRA, then Simple IRA? And once these are maxed out completely eventually, start a diversified investment portfolio with things like (1) e.g. Vanguard's Index, (2) other Stocks, (3) Bonds, (4) Mutual Funds and only then whatever else is left? Trying to create a plan for myself for years moving forward.

Can I actually fund all of these first three accounts? Is there any conflict between them (only 1-2 can be contributed to)? And are there other retirement account options I'm missing that I should include/focus on instead?

Also, is it better to max out one first and then move onto the next one, or spread out my contributions into smaller ones across several from the get go?

Finally, are the limits for some of these first three accounts set only for the year (and it resets the next year), or is there a total limit for any of these accounts for sole proprietors when you can't put any more money in, ever?

Sorry for a boatload of questions. I found a lot of answers as to what these are, but I'm confused on the best Plan of Action, so to speak, so that's what I'm working on. Any advice is really appreciated! Thank you!",1

16-08-04,4w3cs4,Check These 3 Factors Before Making Your Next Trade,"When I’m analyzing charts to find the most attractive trades, I’m looking for a number of different factors. Here are my top three I always pay attention to: 

 

1. VOLUME: I look for equities trading over 1 million shares each day. At lesser volume, support and resistance levels tend to overshoot significantly adding more risk to a trade than I’m typically comfortable with. I look to see if recent trading volume has increased. When it is higher than normal, I expect support and resistance levels to be pierced (typically no more than 1%). If it is significantly higher, i.e. several times its average trading volume, this can signal a turning point in price movement, especially at extreme highs or lows of a chart. 

 

2. TREND: It is important to know if price is trending higher, lower, or sideways. “The trend is your friend, until it ends” which means trades aligning with the trend are lower risk, and if you see the trend change when you’re in a trade, be very cautious with the trade and consider taking profits if you can. The trend on any time frame is easy to identify by using the moving averages. I like to use the 20MA, 50MA, and 200MA. Essentially, if they are sloping up, the trend is up. If they are sloping down, the trend is down. For the best, lowest risk trades, the trend is confirmed by the same trend on larger time frames. For example, if you are using a daily chart to identify a buy level for a swing trade, an uptrend on the chart is preferable, and then, if there is also an uptrend on the weekly chart, even better for the trade, and likewise on the monthly chart. 

 

3. OVERBOUGHT OR OVERSOLD: When an equity is overbought, it essentially means it has had a large move up in price over a very short amount of time and could be due for a pullback. An oversold condition is just the opposite. Be careful with this information. You would never want to enter a trade based solely on an overbought or oversold condition. This is because the degree to which an equity is overbought or oversold is subjective, so it is hard to gauge when a pullback will start. In addition, price can always consolidate making the chance of a pullback much less likely. The pullback may never happen if there’s enough consolidation. When you have an overbought or oversold condition, it is imperative to identify other factors indicating a potential turning point in price.

I was planning on moving my Roth IRA from Principal to Vanguard to avoid Principal's fees. Is there any reason I wouldn't want to do this?",1

Investopedia mentions that ""Increasing price and decreasing volume show lack of interest and this is a warning of a potential reversal."" 
eBay has gone from a volume of 45 million since the beginning of the breakout down to 3 million and the price is still on an upward trend. 
Would this be a sign that the price is about to drop and the stock should be sold?
If that's the case why does it still have a Bullish rating.

But maybe, just maybe 2016 is the year the business goes to the moon? Or as an investment banker might say, maybe 2016 is the year Netflix grows into its valuation ;).

# Description
Netflix is an Internet based entertainment / television network. The Company's members can watch original series, documentaries and feature films online. Revenues come from monthly membership fees for services consisting of streaming content. 

Though with over 80 million subscribers...we all know what they folks do!


## Recent financials 

So sure there is growth and the profit line scrapes along, but the thing that catches my eye is the *delta* in the top line. The business added $1.3bn of sales in 2015 on top of adding $1.1bn in 2004. i.e. the machine is accelerating. 

The current forecast is for sales of $8.7bn in 2016, i.e up $1.9bn. And for 2017 the forecast is $10.7bn, up $2.0bn. So Wall Street thinks the acceleration is here to stay. And if any of the other tech players' history is repeated, acceleration usually implies dominance, market power and cash flow. 

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $6.8bn | $5.5bn | $4.4bn | $3.6bn | $3.2bn|
|EPS | $0.28 | $0.62 | $0.26 | $0.04 | $0.59|

## Competition

Talking competition in their filings:

&gt; The market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as multichannel video programming distributors, Internet-based movie and TV content providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers and DVD rental outlets and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time. 

So that means the cable players, the content players, even the big internet players. 

Unsurprisingly, given it's business doesn't have ""legacy"" infrastructure it's margins are high. Clearly margins are more like the internet giants than the media giants. Fortunately!

Though returns aren't great, probably given they are in investment mode. 

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Netflix, Inc. | $7,625M | 58% | 6%
Comcast Corporation | $75,973M | 33% | 15%
Walt Disney Co | $54,826M | 30% | 20%

DISH Network Corp | $15,137M | 17% | 28%
CBS Corporation | $14,303M | 23% | 28%
SKY PLC (ADR) | $15,945M | 18% | 20%

Facebook Inc | $22,160M | 49% | 13%
Amazon.com, Inc. | $120,637M | 9% | 14%

## Cash / Debt?

Netflix, Inc. has $539M of net debt. That is 1x its latest operating profit. So no real concerns here. 

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $105 for Netflix, Inc. and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 13% to their target. So it's hard to get excited, and worse, in the last 3 months the brokers price target has come down from $120, though the stock's not budged.

# Valuation

And here's where a *value* guy like me usually gives up: 300x earnings. But should I give up? 

I need an envelope:

* Say I'm willing to invest if I can double my money in 5 years. It'll be worth $80bn. 
* Pay 20x earnings in 5 years, and it would need to be generating $4bn of net profit. 
* At a 20% margin that would be $20bn of sales. Up from $8.5bn today. And implies an annual 15-20% topline growth. 
* Doable, yes if the business is now accelerating, but it would likely be a rocky ride!

# Dividends
Netflix, Inc. is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. Nor would I want one! Grow baby, grow!

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 4% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 4% with sales up 26% in the last 6 months. 

Catalysts for $NFLX seem to be pretty obvious... it's all the KPIs, subscribers, churn, revenue per sub and maybe a look at margins. The occasional hit or miss with the original programming will move it too. 

But none of it matters :) Either the business is accelerating or it's not. Agree?

a report by the liberal government JUST outlined how they want to legalize weed. the most key fucking sentence in the whole fucking report is:

Therefore, some form of private sector production with appropriate government licensing….""(page 16)


I know that uses a lot of big words and the only ones you faggots seem to know is moon, yolo and crash. so the point is **They want to only let licensed producers sell and not let people grow at home. They also only want stores to sell licensed producer weed**

There is no single answer to this question, but we will also need A LOT MORE information if we are to give some sort of answer

* How old are you?
* Are you employed/making income? How much?
* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)
* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)
* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
* Any big debts?
* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.

Be aware that these answers are just opinions of Redditors and should be used as a starting point for your research. You should strongly consider seeing a registered financial rep before making any financial decisions!

16-08-05,4waurt,Can we talk about the jobs report in a serious way?,"Thought about adding to the discussion in the previous thread, but it's full of bullshit.

Last month was 292k, but this month's expectations were only 180k (see [this](http://imgur.com/a/oLhPi))... So we beat expectations with 255k, but it's still a significant decline from last month, and I'd imagine a decline from last year, but I can't find that info right now.

Also, unemployment came in at 4.9% vs. 4.8% expectation, not bad, but combined with what is realistically a decline in job creation, I would think that this is actually a bearish sign moving forward.

What are your thoughts? Also, if someone can help me understand why the consensus estimate was so low this month, that'd be great. It  seems like market manipulation to me, but what the fuck do I know?",5

16-08-05,4w82gq,Newbie looking for advice,"So I'm new to stocks. Very young (16, my dad has gotten me into investing in stocks). So I was wondering what to look for in a stock? Obviously if it's constantly rising on the graph that's good.. But what other stats on it should I look at and what should they be around?

Right now I have 1 share of Boeing (uncle got it for me to say I own part of Boeing lol) and $500 worth of shares in Waste Management, forget the AMT off the top of my head. I started with $500 value of stocks and after about a year and a half I'm up to $900ish.. I haven't invested since then and just collected some dividends. 

That brings me to my next point. What are some good companies that are relatively cheaper (for my amount of money) that also give out decent dividends for their price? My dad has taught me his way of investing... Buying stable, steadily growing companies that give out dividends and just sit back and watch the money pile up, then reinvest that money into either more shares of companies or invest in other companies. He's not a fan of the whole buying low selling high cuz it can backfire and seems a little more tricky to do. And I prefer his style more.

So any advice on what to look for and how I should invest would be really awesome. Thanks!",1

- get 4 or 5 0% interest credit cards for your 25% deposit
- seek angel investment to cover 20k refurb costs

Once you've funded, bought, and refurbished your property (which should be worth 30-40k more, then remortgage the property, repay your investor and clear your credit cards then rinse and repeat.

# Description
Xylem Inc. is engaged in the design, manufacturing, and application of engineered technologies for the water industry. Their products include: water and wastewater pumps, filtration &amp; treatment, with pumps, values, heat exchangers, etc. 

It's fascinating stuff their annual report, telling you about the life cycle of water in our modern world. And frankly, with the environment front of mind...

## Recent financials 

Now the top line isn't showing any progress, and if you look at the gross margin, it's flat too...at 38%, but in 5 years operating margin's risen to 12% from 10%. Showing a steady increase in earnings and letting the dividend rise too.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $3.7bn | $3.9bn | $3.8bn | $3.8bn | $3.8bn|
|EPS | $1.87 | $1.83 | $1.22 | $1.59 | $1.50|

## Competition

From their latest filing:

&gt; Competition in the water transport and treatment technologies markets focuses on product performance, reliability and innovation, application expertise, brand reputation, energy efficiency, product life cycle cost, timeliness of delivery, proximity of service centers, effectiveness of our distribution channels and price. Our key competitors include KSB Inc., Sulzer Ltd., Evoqua Water Technologies, Danaher Corporation, Grundfos, Wilo SE, Pentair Ltd. and Franklin Electric Co., Inc.

Not really household names are they! 

Looking at the margin, seems like it's still on the rise, and when compared to the peers, maybe there are more efficiencies to squeeze out of the pipe?

|Last 12 months|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Xylem Inc | $3,675M | 16% | 16%
Danaher Corporation | $22,080M | 22% | 11%
Pentair PLC | $6,622M | 17% | -ve
Franklin Electric Co. | $922M | 16% | 12%
IDEX Corporation | $2,056M | 25% | 20%
Flowserve Corp | $4,358M | 14% | 15%
Graco Inc. | $1,298M | 26% | 28%
Colfax Corp | $3,865M | 12% | 4%

## Cash / Debt?

Xylem Inc has $648M of net debt. That is 1.1x it's latest operating profit. So little to worry about here.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $46.15 for Xylem Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of -2% to their target. Gawd... how the brokers can show their face on CNBC! Even 3 months ago the target was $43 and the stock at $41. 

# Valuation

Turning to valuation, I'm a little flummoxed, over 20 times forward earnings for an industrial business that's not able to grow it's topline? And a small cap stock at that.

# Dividends
Xylem Inc is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.63 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $0.59 per share. That is a 7% growth. The forecast dividend of $0.63 compares to a forecast EPS of $2.05. And they are buying back stock too.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 12% that compares with no change in the earnings forecasts. On a 6 month view the stocks up 30% v earnings upgrades of 10%. Go figure!

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/xyl/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers.

&gt; We continue to expect to generate revenues of approximately $3.7 billion for the full year, including 1% growth from acquisitions and foreign exchange headwind of approximately 2%.

They go on to say that they continue to see margin gains and that the different business units are getting low single digit growth. Look further to 2017 they see their pipeline is up on the year and strong.

So... it's a pretty clean story... increased demand for water globally, a need for investment, an ability to squeeze some efficiencies out of the business. A fragmented market where they could acquire and improve.

But sensible as the business is, it's not cheap or growth. So on the scale of Value &lt; &gt; Quality &lt; &gt; Growth &lt; &gt; Speculative... I'd have to say it's a quality play! Sure if the secular fascinates you... but otherwise, maybe there's somewhere else to focus your efforts?

16-08-05,4wc1or,Question about TSLA - SCTY merger,"Hi All, I have read a few topics on this, but am still unclear.  Not looking for specific advice, just looking to see if the way I am thinking about this is correct.  

So I have a large (for me) position in SCTY.  I would assume that SCTY's price will not fluctuate much out of the $24-$25 range since we know how much we are getting for it.  TSLA on the other hand can fluctuate.  Assuming that I feel that TSLA stock will go up while SCTY stays stagnant, should I sell my SCTY stock and just preemptively buy TSLA?  Of course I could be wrong and TSLA could go down while SCTY stays the same, but if I feel otherwise, it does not make sense to just wait until my stock rolls over correct?  

Is there anything with the valuation that I am not understanding?  Ie.  The transaction is based on the valuation at the time of the bid, so that it does not matter when the transaction takes place?  Ie. if TSLA doubles before the actual transaction then all SCTY shares will be worth 4.8 billion because it doubled since the bid took place?

I hope this makes sense.  Thank you!!

anyway, it's very near it's 1-year low right now, and I expect it to jump up next week.

implied volatility is SUPER low due to earnings report, so options on this stock are fucked right now... but I would say it's not a bad idea to buy into the low IV and get some ATM calls for like, &lt;20 days out or so on the WAY cheap if you're not into the whole bag-holding thang.

16-08-05,4wa12x,Understand The Jobs Report Tomorrow So You Can Profit,"The markets are flat again today as all eyes turn to the Non Farm Payrolls Report tomorrow. Expectations are for a gain of approximately 175,000 jobs in the month of July. So what happens if the number comes in sharply above or below estimates? Anything too high or too low will shock the markets and cause selling. Below I reveal the ranges, along with the likely stock market reaction.

 

1. Neutral Number

Any number between 150,000 and 200,000 will be looked at as a goldilocks report. In other words, the job gains are not too strong to force the Federal Reserve's hand to raise interest rates but not too weak to show the economy is sliding towards recession.

 

2. Slightly Warm Number

A number between 201,000 and 250,000 will be looked at as a slightly strong number. This will cause the markets to think there is a very slight chance of an interest rate hike later in 2016. The Dollar may strengthen slightly and interest would likely bounce. This could cause some minor selling in the stock market, but nothing major.

 

3. Slightly Weak Number

A number between 100,000 and 149,000 would be viewed as slightly weak. The markets would likely believe the Federal Reserve will not hike rates at any point in 2016. Yields may slip a little and the Dollar likely would weaken. Markets would react in a flat to slightly lower manner with the ever so slight hint of a potential economic slowdown drifting through its mind.

 

4. Extremely Strong Number

A number over 250,000 would be very negative for the stock market. It would potentially put two rate hikes on the table and suggest the Federal Reserve is behind the curve on raising interest rates. It would also cause the Dollar to spike dramatically higher and yields jump sharply. Yields jumping would cause money flow to exit stocks and enter the bond market, thus creating a stock market sell off.

 

6. Extremely Weak Number

A jobs number below 100,000 would freak the market out worst of all. Why? Because it would send a panic of recession through the stock market. This would be two extremely poor jobs reports in the last three. In addition, it would suggest to investors that all the Federal Reserve easing over the past seven years has not worked in a sustainable way. Investors and the stock market would likely start to lose confidence in the Federal Reserves ability to stem a recession and a huge stock market sell off would follow.

16-08-05,4wa57f,Tesla to *turn a profit* by Q3,"TL;DR: I believe Tesla will miss Q3 targets big time.

**The Facts**

It has come to my attention that even after the raging success of Q2 earnings the majority of analysts still [expect Tesla Motors to turn a net profit in Q3](https://www.estimize.com/tsla/fq2-2016#chart=historical).

Quick recap:

* First fatal self-driving car crash 3 months ago. Authorities conclude Autopilot was at fault.

* Deliveries and earnings looking grim.

* Elon Musk announces face-saving master plan ""part deux"". Turns out you'll be able to rent out your Tesla, plus promises of larger vehicles and something about a solar cell roof.

* Tesla announces they're buying Elon's cousin's SolarCity in confusing deal that may or may not have a purpose other than mangling the two together to do some smoke&amp;mirrors accounting.

* Tesla misses estimates badly.

* Tesla says they're ""on track"" to pump out the expected number of cars, i.e. they're not failing at the most basic requirement for generating revenue. Keep in mind this is official PR, that's about the best thing they can come up with.

* EPS and revenue estimates are revised down but both still record high.

Let's play **angel's advocate** for a moment and figure out how Tesla could actually pull it off and deliver a profit next quarter:

Over the last 3 quarters they averaged $12500, $17000 and $19000 gross profit per unit sold, respectively. Let's take the highest of those because Elon == Jesus.

Expenses in Q2 (not counting debt repayment) came to $512 million, let's call it $500MM. In order to break even they have to sell 26300 units in three months. This would be a slam dunk record indeed.

This is far-fetched stuff.

Now let's see the **devil's advocate** side:

The situation's a bit like Q4 last year when after four quarters of robust and linearly increasing losses investors decided Q4 was going to be the magic quarter. They expected revenue to go up over 40% QoQ and a net profit.

Depite record sales Tesla missed expectations in spectacular fashion. Revenue was *only* 3% below expected, but nobody dared guess they would lose so much per share ($0.87 non-GAAP, then a new record).

The biggest reason is operating expenses. Tesla can't stop burning money, expenses are already up 7% since Q4 2015 and the announcement says they're going nowhere but up.

**The Play**

This is where I'm stuck. It's possible the stock goes higher on ridiculous expectations, tumbles on another down revision, rallies again and then delivers a miss.

Am I supposed to close my short position? Am I supposed to buy calls and accept Elon as my savior? I really don't know. Help appreciated.",3

Additionally to try and lock in more profits you could have a higher secondary sell limit to try and capture a higher peak than you anticipate. Brokers could charge extra fees for the conditional sell limit and perhaps it could help one with catching the swing during a HFT point in the day when the volume of a stock starts gathering at an accelerated rate.

From the latter article: 
""That controversial decision was made one day in 2013 in Yakima, Wash., when CEO Hagedorn wandered into a garden center. The store had hardly any Scotts merchandise, but there was a massive row of equipment for hydroponics, a method of growing that allows people to cultivate cannabis (or any other plant, for that matter) indoors, using targeted lighting and liquid solutions spiked with nutrients. Hagedorn asked to see the store owner, and out walked a short guy with wild hair and a lazy eye. He told Hagedorn that everyone called him an idiot when he first started selling hydroponics equipment, but the stuff was flying off the shelves, with an average receipt of $400–straight cash. It was a starkly different scene from what he’d just witnessed at a Home Depot across town, which had plenty of Scotts Miracle-Gro products but no hydroponics equipment. “Two worlds, same town. I came back, and I told everyone ‘We’re doing it,’ ” Hagedorn recalls. “ If you don’t like it, leave. We’re doing it. It’s beyond stopping. And we’re not getting into pot growing. We’re talking dirt, fertilizer, pesticides, growing systems, lights. You know it’s a multibillion-dollar business, and we’ve got no growth in our core. Are you guys stupid?”

Hagedorn is backing up his big talk with serious cash. He shelled out $135 million last year on two California-based businesses that sell fertilizers, soils and accessories to pot growers, recently spent another $120 million on a still-undisclosed lighting and hydroponics equipment company in Amsterdam and promises to invest about another $150 million by the end of 2016. Altogether, the deals are bigger than the largest single acquisition in the history of Scotts Miracle-Gro, which takes in $160 million of profit on $3 billion in sales annually.""

[$VALE](http://imgur.com/BisP3Dr) recently broke resistance of 6.04 and the next stop technically is 6.25 (most recent high un-tested) *also is the 52 week high*. With oil and the market booming we could definitely see this test the highs and break through it as long as the recent rumored news is somewhat true. 

[Possibly selling $3B worth of their mining business.](http://blogs.barrons.com/emergingmarketsdaily/2016/08/05/brazil-miner-vale-could-sell-fertilizer-biz-to-mosaic/)

But if you can also see how well Brazil has been doing lately, check out the chart for [$EWZ](http://imgur.com/NZ7U4LC) , it is their ETF that is breaking new highs and the MACD is curling bullish and the RSI still has some room to go. I am hoping that the olympics help boost this ETF and stock. Also there was a huge buyer of the ETF for around 1.4m shares this week. Someone is expecting this to continue. 

Since VALE is a Brazilian company, I hope some crazy entrepreneur tries to build up their economy and infrastructure (they are in a bad recession). I highly doubt this considering how bad the countries economy is but hey you never know what some crooked head honchos will do with the countries money.

That being said, this is not a long term trade but this is a short term trade with a max holding period of 13 days from now. GL if you don't put your balls to the wall on this play Go F Urself. I bought the calls at .22 (should've been .20 but I bought over the ask like an idiot)

So my idea is that, when the stock (for example) goes up 1% you buy, and when it goes down 0.5% you sell. So if the price goes up 2% then drops down, you would have made profit. The numbers are made up, but wouldn't this be a good strategy if you set the numbers so that they don't get affected by extremely small movements, but still buy and sell multiple times a day? Also if it goes down 2%, you first sell, then buy again when it starts going up. You also profited from that trade.

16-08-06,4wh5rv,Value investing flaw?,"Wondering if someone could chime in on this thought of mine:

Lets say we want to take a value investing approach to buying a stock. We think company ABC is undervalued by share price and think it's a good buy after doing our analysis and building a DCF model and doing comparables analysis.

After building our DCF, we think the company has an upside of 30% for example.... sure. But let's look at the valuation multiples now:

How can you just use comparable multiples for this analysis when you are taking a value investing approach. When you look at future years multiples such as EV/EBITDA... the EV takes in account the equity price of the stock. And we are taking the assumption that the stock price today not only reflects yesterday's performance, but tomorrow's performance as well of the company. So in essence, were not really doing an apples to apples comparison when we use a DCF vs multiples, are we?

The whole point of the DCF was to see if the stock was undervalued and in our analysis, we did conclude the stock was undervalued. But now, all of a sudden we want to assume the stock price has its future expectations already factored in? ",2

That said, a strangle such as this would both insure against losses and provide a bonus windfall if the stock moves as I expect it will. Am I stupid to consider selling before earnings AND have a strangle with put above cost basis?",4

I recently invested about $5,500 in two different S&amp;P 500 index funds, that are now up 5.61% and 3.75%, respectively, totaling a current gain of $257.33. When the December purchasing period for my company's stock rolls around, I'd really like to sell these index funds and couple it with my savings to buy about $10,000 worth. Would it be dumb to set up a trailing stop-loss of about 2-3% on these funds?

Right now I trade on a TD Ameritrade paper money account and for the year my portfolio has only grown a measly 10%. I dont trade all the time because I really just loose motivation because I will go on a few streaks where I loose and then I will win but its not big and it really just feels like luck.

Just a few facts about myself
Im a 26 yo currently living in Vancouver. I work for auto insurance company with a base salary of 60 000 cad but with overtime anywhere up From 80000-110 000(overtime is often offered).
I live with my parents and will plan to for the indefinite future.
No plans to move out of Vancouver 

My monthly expenses are:

Car insurance 0-paid for the entire year

Gas 150

Toll bridge 120

Food 400(I mooch off my parents)

Rent 0

Misc(gym, going out phone plan) 300

So the total would be about a 1000. this number does not vary much
 
My net income has always been in the range of 3500-5000 per month


I currently have the mindset to purchase somewhere near a college area and rent it out. Apartments are leasehold and going around 350000-420000 for a two bedroom. 
The rent prices in those area re around 1800-2300 per month. Mostly international students and masters students with families

16-08-07,4wjt2p,Is my portfolio in need of immediate change?,"Hello /r/investing 

I have stated working as soon as I finished college. I didn't know anything about loans (had none), finance, banking, credit, 401k, stocks, etc. nothing. I have since then stared reading and learning about that. With the recent purchase of a house I wanted to start making sure my portfolio is balanced for the future. 

A sizable portion of my compensation from my company is in stock in the company. Since I joined, I never touched it, and that has accumulated over the years to ~$85k. Aside from that I have $15k in 401k (Fidelity's LifePath plan), and just put a $100k ad a down payment on a house. 

so now my only semi liquid is stocks. I'm sure having 100% of my stock portfolio in 1 stock is a bad idea. I have been lucky and neted about 33% gain since the company has been doing well, but now wants to balance it a bit. 

I sold about $28k last week and moved them to ~~FSVTX~~ FSTVX. The stock has surprisingly gone up since since about $1. Anyway, I want to eventually move all my stocks to a more diverse index fund like ~~FSVTX~~ FSTVX or even something like Wealthfront, but my question is about whether I can wait to benefit from any short term gains before moving off the stock?
I was thinking to setup a Limit Loss oder to only sell the stop if it starts to fall below a certain amount. I was thinking I'l update it every now and then to protect myself from any strong swings in a single company's stock. Does that sound like a reasonable idea or is tha t not how the market works and I should just move as soon as possible instead of waiting? I've never even used Limit Loss orders before, just read about them and was thinking how they can help my situation. 

Thanks guys! I really appreciate any help",1

16-08-07,4wlnp5,Noob Still learning. Interpreting $HTM SEC filing,"Disclaimer: I am learning something new every day, and am hungry for knowledge, so please correct any inaccurate ideas I have. Also, have $HTM in my portfolio.

I am looking for another opinion on a stock I am holding a long position in. $HTM is a microcap alternative energy provider with a good P/E, and good Assets vs. Liabilities.

JCP has been buying $HTM and currently has a 15.4% stake in the company. He is now up for vote for an extended 7th chair on the Board of Directors.

$HTM has traded at &lt;$1 for about 5 years now, but are in no danger of being de-listed as they have been assessed to be a stable company with solid profits. Their most recent [SEC filing](http://stocknewsflow.com/1172136_000106299316010843_0001062993-16-010843) regarding their Sept 2016 Shareholders meeting has a proposed R/S of between 2:1 - 6:1.

$HTM states that they are hoping to increase volume with a R/S by making their company a feasible option to investors and firms that would normally only consider stocks &gt;$1

On another board I am a member of it has been suggested that the true reason for the consolidation is in response to a JCP takeover bid, and that it is concerning that $HTM did not also reduce the amount of shares authorized. They believe JCP will begin selling off.

Now here is where my understanding gets fuzzy. A R/S would not only consolidate JCPs shares, but every other owners as well. The percentage of ownership does not change. Just because they have a certain amount of shares authorized, that does not mean they are all available for trading, so the only way that $HTM could dilute Pappas's shares is by another public offering, or employees heavily exercising stock options, right? These are routes they could take without a R/S.

Consolidating shares without increasing outstanding shares will lower the float of $HTM, and while a R/S and low float on a penny stock could traditionally be viewed as a bad sign for the company, in this case I have no reason to think it is indicative of trouble. A PPA announcement, and it could take off...

I've previously had my and my employers allocations spread over three funds: Target 2050, total bond mkt index, and 500 index fund.  Since I have other holdings elsewhere, I thought I would exchange everything in the bond and 500 indexes for a 100% allocation into the target 2050 fund.

My question is this:  In doing so, will I avoid the 25$ fee per fund for the other two funds if I change the allocation ratio and make the exchange? Or is there something else I have to do in order to achieve this?

Sorry for the stupid question.  This is all new to me, and I'm trying to learn now while my holdings are relatively small that way I minimize my risk for mistakes in the future.  Thanks!

Edit:  For those looking at this thread in the future:  I called Vanguard, and for those enrolled in small-business simple IRA's through their employer, you cannot removed funds once added to your account, but if you empty your holdings and perform an exchange ( like I did) you will not be assessed the 25$ per fund fee each year.  So it essentially accomplishes my goal :)

We are in our 5th year and business is steady and growing, service based, $600k gross. My wife an I are netting about 170k/year. We are maxing out our Roth IRAs and really need to invest more and id love it to be in a tax deferred vehicle. 
I already pay my employees very well for our industry, base salary plus commission, which is rare. I don't want to spend a lot on a 401k because of the service fees. A Simple IRA looks to be the best but we really don't want to come out of pocket the extra money for the matching since we are already maxing out what we are able to pay our people and we are trying to get them insurance as well. 
I've already helped each employee budget, as well as open their own Roth IRA. Does anyone have advice on how to create the tax deferred savings for ourselves without having to come out of pocket to offer something for employees as well?

16-08-07,4wmfe9,An idea about jobless claims trends and an upcoming recession,"After getting slightly saved from my gold bagholding during last week's jobless claims report I decided to look into the history of these reports. The website I used to look at the data chart is this: http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/jobless-claims Looking at the chart I decided to figure out the trends, the mean values, the average length between spikes, the causes of the spikes, etc. What I found is that the average time period between spikes in these claims is ~8 years. Also they clearly happen due to an economic crisis here in the US or in the rest of the world. Looking at the max chart of the data the 1971 spike was due to the 1970's energy crisis, the one in the mid 1970's was due to the secondary banking crisis in the UK (this links to what is happening in UK right now btw), the early 1980's spike was due to the early 80's recession, early 90's due to the recession then, same with the dot com bubble and the most recent financial crisis of 2007-2008. From this it is clear that we are clearly due for a recession and a spike in these claims. The average being 8 years we are at this point. Also looking at the variance averages in these numbers it is seen that the low average is around 250,000 and the average high is around 430,000. Ever since 2008 which topped at around 650,000 these claims have been on a steady decrease. At one point they reached the 250,000 level but are now starting to rise again. Personally I feel that the main companies are trying to say this isn't a big deal to help their investments, but in reality I feel it is the start of something big. With the European economy sitting on a time bomb, China weakening, and the US in a deadlock between saving consumers or banks with the rates, to me the economy is on the tip of a huge recession. This week's jobless claims report will show low to mid 270k. The news will say that it isn't a big deal until it reaches 300k, but slowly those numbers will continue to rise. 280k by September is nearly guaranteed and there is nothing the US can do to change this. I know you are going to tell me that I am crazy and I know that the news and fed will continue to hide this issue with random fluff, but trust me a recession is imminent in the near future. If not this coming year, in the next 3 is guaranteed. To sum it up a clear trend is showing that a downtrend in the performance of the economy is historically bound to happen, and current events provide obvious evidence to back this claim up. I highly recommend establishing a position in gold while it is this cheap, or you can establish long term puts on spy that terminate in a year or two. Lmk what you all think.",0

16-08-08,4wqoyl,Y!:Finance: Trump to Propose Moratorium on New Financial Regulations,"A couple of things are starting to come together here, which should be of interest to the /r/investing community.

* Trump's [economic advisory board](http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/08/05/trump-announces-economic-policy-advisory-team/) only contains one economist, or 3, depending on sources.  The rest are billionaires like him.
* [Link](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-propose-moratorium-financial-regulations-043527444.html) to this morning's article -- the first proposal to come out of this group of billionaires is ""stop with the regulations already"".

I've preached for a long time that The Economy is big and complex, and in particular that The Stock Market is NOT The Economy, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is not The Economy, the Unemployment Rates are not The Economy, Non-Farm Payrolls are not The Economy, etc. 

But it would appear as if Mr. Trump feels exactly the opposite: Big Business IS the economy.

Should we be worried?  Or start accumulating cash to invest in Trump-favored businesses?

16-08-08,4wr3w5,Global Bond Olympics,"***Winners:*** There’s the short game and the long game. And for IG debt, the long-end of the curve is winning the race tighter, enduring only a few hills on its run as the 10s30s slope flattens out dramatically thus far this year. When measuring the spread differential between the largest capital structures in the long-dated 20 to 30-year ratings bucket vs. shorter-dated 9 to 11-year bonds, the 10s30s curve has flattened by 44bp year-to-date for non-financial issuers. 


Why can USD long-dated bonds take first place? First, there are fewer global competitors with $314 billion of 15y+ debt outstanding across EUR, GBP, and JPY-denominated issuers combined vs. the towering $1.5 trillion available in the USD IG market. And secondly, as central banks’ balance sheets expand in the Euro area, Japan, and the UK, the global sprint to find carry has, again, fueled demand for higher yielding risk further out the duration curve in the US. 


Over in the HY market, credit spreads have cleared the oil hurdle—as positive carry assets continue to siphon demand over the negative carry along the oil forward curve. However, last week’s WTI weakness certainly slowed down high yield’s furious pace with spreads taking a step back since their recent tights on July 25, widening by 33bp (and by 141bp for HY Energy credits) over that period. We continue to monitor this gradual re-coupling between crude and HY, but we think the spillovers from Energy credits will remain fairly limited relative to past episodes. 


***Losers:*** In the primary market, CCC issuers have fallen far behind, with their 7.5% share of total HY supply ranking as the lowest since 2003 (including the crisis). Despite their limited access to capital markets, CCC refinancing risk is still manageable, however, with only 12% of debt outstanding coming due by 2018. 

***How year-to-date returns stack up:***

Gold:  &gt;10%

1.	GBP IG: 15.3%
2.	EM bonds (EMBI+): 13.6%
3.	WTI price: 12.9% 
4.	US HY: 12.7% 

Silver:  6-10%

5.	US IG: 8.4%
6.	UST 10y: 7.3%
7.	S&amp;P 500: 6.8% 
8.	EUR HY: 6.2%
9.	US Loans: 6.1%

Bronze: &lt;6% 

10.	EUR IG: 5.8%
11.	Agency MBS: 5.4%
12.	Munis: 4.2% 

*Fun fact-Olympics:* As Michael Phelps approached his last lap in the 200-meter butterfly finals in Beijing, the cups of his goggles were completely filled with water and he couldn’t see a thing, not even the wall of the pool to finish. By estimating the number of strokes left and listening to the crowd’s applause, he timed the finish perfectly. Phelps took off his defected goggles to see he won the World Record and another gold. Phelps is now up to 19 gold medals.

However.. it's current market cap is about $400 million, meanwhile I looked on the SEC for it's latest filing (which is a 20-F I guess, I assume this is because it's a Chinese company?) anyways they have a pretty solid balance sheet. They're assets are about 2.5B and Liabilities are at 1.6B, which means their shareholders equity is about 900million.

Market Cap 400mil. Shareholders equity 900mill...
In 99% of companies I research the market cap is usually always higher.. This stock should be valued at least double from where it is should it not?
Of course I did further research and found out the CEO made a bid last year for $9.50 for each outstanding ADS to go private but even if it were to be accepted shouldn't the shares trade around that price too?
It's been so long though from the bid I believe the company knows it is worth more than the offer of the bid and they don't want to accept that price..
Is it because this is a Chinese company and China is a communist country? 
I'm also pretty new to investing so maybe I'm missing something..

I don't have shares of this company at the moment but I'm seriously considering adding it to my portfolio in the near future. This stock has gone up 15% in the last month.
Any answers or comments would be greatly appreciated.

I was wondering, could a fund do something like buy OTM calls then purchase stock to fat finger the number upwards?
This seems like it should be illegal as market manipulation but I haven't found anything specific, so I guess it falls under the umbrella term for market manipulation? 

With that said, say company X works with company Y in order to accomplish this, like X buys the options and Y buys the stock, while concurrently on another ticker X buys the stock and Y buys the options kind of as a handshake, does stuff like this happen?
Seems like if you have something like 100 million dollars to play around with, this wouldn't be that difficult to execute on a mid-cap stock.

It just seems like it's very easy to hide this type of collusion from my perspective, however I don't have a finance background, just work in tech so I'd like input from people who know what they're talking about lol. ",5

Some food for thought as the week begins. In particular: 

""While it is true that financing fiscal deficits has become very easy due to aggressive monetary policy, public debt ratios remain very high and have continued to rise, given still-high fiscal deficits in most advanced economies. Some form of 'helicopter money' could help in theory, by monetizing deficits or cancelling debts held by central banks. However, concerns about the unexpected consequences this could have on the public broader confidence into the system — and, thus, the effectiveness in practice of such radical policies — have kept even Japan's more adventurous policy makers away from it. The resistance elsewhere would likely even be higher. **Hence, should the policies stimulus provided thus far fail to generate the necessary escape velocity for the global economy, the future policy options in response to adverse shocks seem increasingly exhausted.**""

You guys may already know this, but I just learned the hard way: I can't purchase Vanguard admiral shares through my Merrill account. They are only available for initial purchase directly through Vanguard. Wish I knew that before I opened my Merrill account--I just opened it and funded it last week with the intention to buy specific admiral funds.

Any suggestions for me? Should I close Merrill and open a Vanguard? I'd have to transfer the money around, but I guess I could do that. Or I could keep the Merrill account open, buy the funds through a new Vanguard account, and then transfer the shares over to Merrill.

(I had chosen Merrill for the same reason that I've read from other people on here: convenient interface with existing BOA account, free trades due to the amount in the account, and Platinum level service...for what that's worth.)

I'm currently reading the financials of Take-Two Interactive (They own Rockstar Games and quite a few other companies), and I can't make sense of the huge increase in Foreign Tax on their Income Statement this year.

Link to Income Statement I'm reading: http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ttwo/financials

The previous year they accounted for 2.94M in paid foreign taxes, and 12.63M paid the year before that. However, this year, they reported 31.51M in Foreign Tax Deductions (It seems to me; I may be completely off-base). 

I've been reading on CFC's, foreign tax credits, and repatriation, but I still don't understand what happen here.

Did they repatriate Foreign cash in order to reduce their effective tax rate? Without the 31.51M Tax Deduction they would have been looking at 14M rather than 8M in taxes this year.

Own a small position (&lt;10% of portfolio) in AMBC, a financial holding company. They announce earnings after close today. 
Currently a little over $19 a share, I'm in it for $14.64 a share. 

I think there is a lot of upside here, (mainly that it's an extremely complicated company to value, and many don't put in the effort), but they're facing a class action suit, and are a large holder of PR debt, which to me are both massive risks. I like the upside, but I'm getting close to the point where I'm ready to take my 30-40% gain and not worry if it goes up more.

Any one else have any opinions?

16-08-09,4wunpw,How I view where to throw money at when it comes to tech moving forward.,"I often make very long posts, then I delete them, because I just get bored and close my browser, but its been itching me. This sensation to put a huge bet on the market, against my best judgements.

I want to throw money on hardware companies because of how software is forcing most computer functionality to become commoditized.

What does this mean?

Well cloud computing is basically we take all the data and processing out of the office and throw it at some server at god knows where and we just send commands to it to tell it to do whatever the hell we want the powerful server there to do.

Software makes all of this work. (Google enterprise services or MS enterprise services paired with ERP/CRM software.)

Then the short term demand for hardware will be hammered down. Large companies don't need to spend hundreds of millions on drives/engineers/cards. The clientel will literally just vanish overnight (it's happening). The customer base becomes smaller, but who's he one setting up all the cloud servers? Just a few companies, who'll they buy from? Only the best of the hardware industry.

NVDIA, INTEL, WESTERN DIGITAL, and CISCO. And with the way how each of these companies are behaving to lock their own shiny gardens. They'll win the giant trend shift as their respective industries literally go to hell.

Yeah I know peripherals exist, but fuck them, their industry in general is going to hell due to mobile devices.

I'm very serious in throwing half or 30% of my portfolio in these companies. I don't think they are as replaceable as software companies.

Edit: I'm following up on this post because I think I made every think I'm only looking at the application of hardware as in data centers. Nope, that's not the only place I'm thinking about where this tech can be applied.

I believe that the way how we design each and everything in society is preparing for a huge change. Manufacturing will become much more dispersed by 3D printing devices and more and more automated heavy machinery. More and more public infrastructure will apply more complex algorithms/programs that require high processing capacity. Not just for shipping, but water/electric distribution. Farming will become much more automated than it is now and will require a much higher necessity to process supply/demand data. Transportation is going to face a crisis of declining traffic and adopt tech or die.

This is all just a bet that is against my better judgement. And no, I don't care about your shitty data centers. What I do care about is how ubiquitous high speed Internet access will be in the future.",6

It is now mid-August and both founders and 3rd party are still showing as sold-out virtually everywhere.  I have checked availability on newegg multiple times each week (sometimes multiple times in a day) and there is the occasional crappy founders card available but none of the 3rd party cards.  The founders that are in stock are gone by the next day.  The 3rd party cards that become available are gone within hours.  I've followed many NVDA and AMD card releases over the years and I can't remember ever seeing vendors be out of stock for 2+ months.  
Now, I understand that the high end cards are a niche market and probably a very small portion of their revenue.  But what if this is a sign of a larger supply chain or manufacturing issue?

# Description
Expedia makes travel products and services available, on a standalone and package basis, provided by various lodging properties, airlines, car rental companies, destination service providers, cruise lines and other travel product and service companies. 

Just like Priceline, the Big Daddy of the business, it is a maestro of online advertising and gets to the top rankings when you are on Google!  In fact, I'm often shocked that Expedia and Priceline websites rank higher than the place I want to visit.

## Recent financials 

Both the top line and bottom look remarkable for EXPE, but they are flattered by both acquisitions and sales of assets. No surprises on the wheeling and dealing for a business that's controlled by the famed [Barry Diller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Diller).

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $6.7bn | $5.8bn | $4.8bn | $4.0bn | $3.4bn|
|EPS | $5.70 | $2.99 | $1.67 | $2.00 | $3.41|

## Competition

From their annual filing
&gt; Our competition, which is strong and increasing, includes online and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate travelers, including travel agencies, tour operators, travel supplier direct websites and their call centers, consolidators and wholesalers of travel products and services, large online portals and search websites, certain travel meta-search websites, mobile travel applications, social media websites, as well as traditional consumer eCommerce and group buying websites. We face these competitors in local, regional, national and/or international markets. 

So if you can think of a player... they are a competitor. In fact the list over at Priceline is laughably long, even including Alibaba and Amazon. Though they do highlight the ITA acquisition by Google and their recent push into online travel. 

The immediate thing that hits me is the low margin. How come the sister business TripAdvisor has a higher margin? And Priceline, wow! Good old Capt'n Kirk ads eh? In fact looking at the sales and marketing line of $EXPE and $PCLN they spend the same $ amount each year, even though one it substantially bigger :(

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Expedia Inc | $7,736M | 13% | 6%
Priceline Group Inc | $9,531M | 38% | 29%
Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (ADR) | $1,918M | -ve | N/A
Travelport Worldwide Ltd | $2,310M | 23% | N/A
Tripadvisor Inc | $1,467M | 17% | 10%

## Cash / Debt?

Expedia Inc has $862M of net debt. That is 0.8x it's latest operating profit. So plenty of room for more M&amp;A activity then!

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $133.88 for Expedia Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 18% to their target.

# Valuation

20 times earnings for businesses expect to grow 20% per annum. Sounds like a steal! Though am surprised that this industry is expected to grow so strongly. If that's how the market pans out, 20x would be a bargain. Though do those earnings turn into cashflow? 

Though I have to say, I'm puzzled by CTrip. How come it's worth more than Expedia when it's a fraction of the sales?

# Dividends
Expedia Inc is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.90 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $0.84 per share. That is a +7% growth. The forecast dividend of $0.90 compares to a forecast EPS of $4.93.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 1% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -3%. Though forecasts are pretty bumpy with earnings up 24% in 6 months and the stock only up 13%.

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/expe/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers.

&gt; Turning to our financial expectations for 2016, on a consolidated basis excluding eLong, we continue to expect full year adjusted EBITDA to grow 35% to 45% year-over-year. We do think that the contribution to full-year adjusted EBITDA for Orbitz and HomeAway combined will be higher than our previous expectations with the relatively lower contribution from the rest of the business.

So the new brands are powering the growth. And 4Q this year is going to look good versus a tough 4Q last year. And perhaps the strong dollar will power some international travel? Nice!

Or is this a classic consumer stock at the top of the economic cycle?

16-08-09,4wx5iq,Lets talk single family homes.,"The median US income has barely moved from 28,561 in 2000 to 30,376 (a 6% increase).

Over the same period, median home price in the US has increased from 166k to 303k (an 83% increase).

Interest rates are at an all time low, causing real estate to be cheap on a monthly level.  In 2000 the 30 year fixed rate was some 8.5%.  Now it's some 3.5%.

On a monthly level, that 166k house costs ~$1,276 in 2000 and the 303k house costs ~$1,361 today (a 6.5% increase, which matches wages nicely).

Of course, all those 166k homes have long since been refinanced at 3.5% to the tune of ~745/mo (or they are paid off entirely).  In this environment, the boomers are holding onto their starter properties which are generating cash flow positive rental income.

I've heard that the property areas that are doing well (Denver, Dallas) are primarily driven by supply shortages.  Houses are on the market for less than a day and are being sold above list price.  These areas are growing for sure, but the primary complaint is limited supply.  Why is the supply so limited?  One hypothesis of mine is the prevalence of rental properties.

I've heard more and more commercials on the radio from rental management companies to ""rent your home, don't sell"".  So is there a rental herd mentality out there?

If interest rates rise, will property values drop proportionally?  When boomers start selling their rental properties int he next few years, will there be an oversupply?

I made [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/4wqnwa/on_the_contrary_tesla_burns_less_than_0/d6a5tgf) post to /r/teslamotors to explain that tesla does not have free cash flow and is operating at loss. I probably stuck a hornets nest, but I don't care. I was wondering, if I made any mistakes or miscalculations on my post.

Copy of The post:
&gt; Most of people here don't know shit about financial statements(Including you and article writer. Sorry). I don't claim to be expert, because I have been a ""serious"" investor for less than year.

&gt; From Tesla 2015 10-K:

&gt; Automotive: 3,740,973

&gt; Services: 305,052

&gt; Total Revenues: 4,046,025

&gt; Cost Of Revenues

&gt; Automotive: 2,823,302

&gt; Service: 299,220

&gt; Total Cost Of Revenue: 3,122,522

&gt; Research and development: 717,900

&gt; Selling, general and administrative: 922,232

&gt;Teslas Operating Cash Flow is Total Revenue - OPEX: Total Revenues(4,046,025) - Total Cost Of Revenue(3,122,522) - Research and development(717,900) - Selling, general and administrative(922,232): 4,046,025 - 3,122,522 - 717,900 - 922,232 = -716,629

&gt; So they had Operating Cash Flow of -716,629

&gt; Free Cash Flow is calculated by Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures(1,670,000). -716,629 - 1,670,000 = -2,386,629

&gt; Unlike this article tells us, there is no Free Cash Flow on Tesla Financial Data!

16-08-09,4wv9k0,"Disruptive Graphite &amp; Hydrogen tech set to rock market","Hazer Group is a spinnoff of University of Western Australia research into low-CO2 emitting Hydrogen production.  The global Hydrogen market is massive but is hindered by current production methodologies that are energy intensive, require costly catalysts, and worst of all are heavy emitters of CO2 at source (although the combustion of Hydrogen itself is clean).

The Hazer process involves the use of an abundant feedstock (Natural Gas), used to “crack” an abundant catalytic material (basic iron ore).  This results in Hydrogen production with near-ZERO CO2 emissions.

As an additional bonus it is found that 70% of the methane is converted to high purity battery-grade GRAPHITE.  Currently the non-optimised process produces graphite of 99% purity.
It is apparent that by tweaking the gas and composition of the iron ore it is possible to produce a variety of graphite grades including Graphene.

Lab reactors at UWA and U Sydney are currently developing the process and a pilot plant will go into operation in 2017.

The stock trades on the Australian Stock Exchange as HZR (options HZRO) and I commend this company to anyone who can see the benefit of zero CO2 Hydrogen production at less than half the cost of  current processes along with high quality onsite synthetic graphite production (are you listening Mr. Musk?).

I am extremely excited about the prospects for this technology and currently hold stock.  

As always, I urge readers to do their own research.

# Description
International Business Machines Corporation has five segments: Global Technology Services (GTS), Global Business Services (GBS), Software, Systems Hardware and Global Financing. But you can probably think of it as a 2 trick pony: Software &amp; IT Consulting. Sure they've got fancy things like Watson, but aren't they just marketing for their consulting arm?

## Recent financials 

It doesn't do them justice to look at 5 years, but here goes...sales keep slipping, earnings show no sign of progress, but the board keeps ramping the dividend and buying back stock in the billions.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $82bn | $93bn | $98bn | $103bn | $105bn|
|EPS | $13.42 | $11.90 | $14.94 | $14.37 | $13.06|
|DPS | $5.00 | $4.25 | $3.70 | $3.30 | $2.90|

## Competition

Not surprisingly they say

&gt; The company is a globally-integrated enterprise, operating in more than 175 countries. The company participates in a highly competitive environment, where its competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities. Overall, across its business segments, the company recognizes hundreds of competitors worldwide.

In IT, they mention:  Accenture, Alphabet Inc. (Google), Amazon.com, Inc. (Amazon), Computer Sciences Corporation, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft); India-based service providers; the consulting practices of public accounting firms; and many companies that primarily focus on local markets or niche service areas.

In Software they mention: CA, Inc., Microsoft, Oracle Corporation (Oracle), Salesforce.com and SAP.

And given their business generates circa 50% of its cashflow from IT and Software, it's not surprising that the margin's higher than Accenture etc but lower than SAP etc. That aside, what's clear is they have exceptionally good returns. 

And although [Buffett recognizes](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/02/buffett-weve-never-sold-a-share-of-ibm-and-might-buy-more.html) that competition is intense, they clearly have an expertise in their IT division that gives them an edge in terms of pricing and closing deals.

## Cash / Debt?

International Business Machines Corp. has $33,908M of net debt. That is 1.9x its latest operating profit. So yeah that's at the high end for a tech business, But it's hardly that concerning given the cashflow and size of the business.


# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $153.90 for International Business Machines Corp. and their recommendation to clients is _Hold_. That implies an downside of -5% to their target. Yuck! 


# Valuation

So they think it should trade on single digit earnings? It's as _boring_ a business as Apple or Hewlett Packard Enterprises?

# Dividends

International Business Machines Corp. is forecast to pay a dividend of $5.24 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $5.00 per share. That is a 5% growth. The forecast dividend of $5.24 compares to a forecast EPS of $13.51. So plenty of room for buybacks too.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 8% &amp; that compares with no change in the earnings forecasts. On a 6 month view it's up 25% with no movement in earnings. So...all of a sudden everyone's fallen in love with IBM, even though the 2017 is expected to be another down year too.

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ibm/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers.
&gt; remember our strategy and point of view is that to be successful you need to bring together cognitive solutions to improve decision-making and outcomes, to approach that with an industry context and skills, and to enable that in a hybrid environment to get the agility of the cloud while leveraging the breadth of an enterprise data and processes. 

Consultant speak, eh? Let's sell more stuff to more industries focusing on making them more profitable and efficient. 

I can imagine IBM will keep the M&amp;A machine going, buying enterprise software businesses that let them lock in corporates. Locking in clients has worked a dream to date for them, MSFT, SAP and ORCL. Why change a great strategy, if it let's you carve up the enterprise market. 

Though the one dangerous item on the horizon is the perception that when the CEO retires, that the new CEO will _kitchen sink_ the numbers, as a way to have a low base to work off. Whether it be this Ginni's appointment, or here 2 predecessors, the 2 quarters after a new CEO arrives, ain't been pretty.

My friend is an investment banker who is also a former stock broker and he has an overwhelmingly high prediction that NVIDIA's share price will jump significantly (&gt;3%) just following earnings release. 

He's gotten many post-earnings share trends correct, such as GOOGL, AMZN and AAPL where he also predicted sizable share price jumps, and I was able to make quick profits. He also predicted (I'm guessing he has insider information) the recent Biogen merger which sent shares jumping ~10%. 
He has not missed any of his post-earnings share movement predictions so far this year!

He admits that he cannot predict day-to-day share price movements, however, as he says that this is more computer algorithm-based (he talked about supercomputers and how many large investment companies utilize this and humans just can't compete in making accurate predictions on a normal day-to-day basis). 

I guess the main things NVIDIA has going for it are:

- Insiders have been heavy buyers of NVIDIA shares over the last week

- New graphics cards which cover more of the market compared to AMD

- The only company in the market providing driverless technologies to Tesla and other electric car manufacturers - a MAJOR future growth engine

- Strong sales of the new GTX 10XX GPUs

- NVIDIA GPUs to be used in the upcoming Nintendo NX console

- Relatively strong US job numbers

The BMW 330e is probably about the same size as a Model 3. Given BMWs technology-forward image, perhaps some those 330e drivers will be ready to make the jump to a long-range electric car after their leases expire.

BMW has just boosted the range of the BMW i3 from 81 to 114 miles for the 2017 model year.

I'm a college student (turning 19) in New York City and I've recently become interested in general investing. I've always heard from my dad how much you can make from real estate and how great of an investment it is. I wanna get into it. I did a little research as to how to get into it and I came across Fundrise. I wanted a way to invest in real estate with very little effort and Fundrise seems to be what I'm asking for. But I know very little to nothing about this field (I'm a science guy). Is Fundrise a good fit for what I want? I don't have a job but I do have a lot of money to work with (50k). I don't have loans to pay or any bills to pay. I just have this money and want to invest it. Also, can someone explain the taxes that come with investing with Fundrise and how much it is and how to file them and where to file them and everything about it that you can possibly type. I know absolutely nothing and many of the resources I've looked into look like they assume you've taken a business class before. I know I can sound frustrating to some but try to make it as simple as possible. Is Fundrise a good option for me? What other way can I go about it?

When people compare companies (of similar size) on return on asset it is normally considered that the bigger the return the better. However, if company doesnt pay dividends and just keeps it as cash or cash equivelant on balance sheet the assets will increase. It will show an unfavorable ROA for the company, when it just keeps cash in its reserves when compared to a company that has better ROA but has no cash under its assets. 

I can think of similar scenarios for a lot of different financial ratios.  Now I want to come up with my own financial ratios.I hope I am wrong and just overthinking. Please helpe me. ",3

Not only that, but millennials are already putting off buying cars and opting instead to Uber or Lyft their way around town.

Add on top of that the cyclical nature of auto sales, and the fact that 2015 and 2016 may shape up to be the two best years for U.S. vehicle sales EVER, and it appears we're at the cycle's peak.

Tesla. Google. Uber. Apple? These could very well be the auto titans of tomorrow since legacy carmakers aren't taking these trends seriously.

* You cannot stake your entire networth in any investment

* The market remains stable i.e no major political event etc

* Of the one million in assets you have, 50% is from your own company and the rest 50% is distributed however you wish (stocks, bonds, real estate whatever)

* You choose the type of business you own (For me it would be a company dealing with digital conent marketing/consultancy).

***Before* you make a post asking for advice or basic information, please consider these suggestions:**

1. Take a [look through our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) as a ton of info (or links leading to info) that people normally ask for can already be found there. This includes everything from the basics of what a stock is and how to buy stocks online to how to analyze a company as a potential investment.

2. Join [our chat room](http://www.r-stocks.com/chat/) where basic questions can be answered instantly without the need to make a new post and wait for responses. With 70 users on during peak times, there is probably someone around to help you, though this is more likely during trading hours (9:30am - 4pm EDT).

3. [Use the search function](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) as many questions you have were probably asked in the past.

After doing the above, we understand you may still have questions and will want help with your personal situation rather than simply reading about other people's situations. However, lately we've been receiving numerous low-quality posts along the lines of: ""Hi. I'm new to stocks. How do I start?"" Please note these types of posts may now be *deleted without warning.* With the very large and obvious links all around the subreddit directing users to the wiki, there is no reason anyone should be making these types of posts.

If you wish to make a post asking for guidance through the market/investing/stocks, please add detail about your current financial situation and the specific topics you need assistance with. Some questions that should be considered are: how old are you?, what is your income?, are you in debt?, what is your risk tolerance?, how many years of experience (or not) do you have?, how much capital will you be starting with?, do you have money in savings?, what topics have you read about and what do you still not understand?, are there any companies in particular you wish to invest in?, what kind of learning material are you interested in (e.g. books, articles, videos, websites)?, are you trying to generate an income from the market or just plan for retirement?, etc.

Generic posts do not give anyone insight into your personal situation and thus no meaningful advice can be given to you. As such, these posts will be deleted as they are of low quality and do not contribute to the subreddit. 

**tl;dr:** If you would like people to put time into providing thorough advice for you, you need to put time into providing a thorough insight into your current situation. Generic, bare-bones, and low-effort posts will be removed.

You should also consider flairing your post as ""Advice Request"" or ""Question"" once posted so that it stands out to other users. Normally I flair all posts on my own when I can, but you can expedite the process by flairing your own post to make it more noticeable. ",74

I have been interested in buying low and selling high, just like the rest of you, but I have been doing something that I recently found out was wrong.
I'm 20 years old, and I'm not the wisest person out there. For those who are wondering how I got my money, my dad got broke from gambling when I was 12(Not saying he's a bad dad, he's an awesome dude who works honest now), and I started my own retail business at 15. Now I can say that I have a pretty good life. 
So anyway, back to my story. I heard from a business partner that there was a group for stocks a few months ago. I got interested, and I decided to join the club. Seemed that it wasn't your usual club. Each group consisted of 10 guys, and they would each pool in a hundred thousand dollars (I just used google for currency exchanging from WON to dollars, might be wrong), buy that much worth of stocks and sell it once the price went up. Now I have done a few of these, and I made a some profit but and I don't know if I should continue. Can annnnnyone tell me how this impacts the market?",1

I end up with $100 credit in my account (minus exercising fee).

16-08-11,4x5cx4,Why should I invest in bonds in tax advantaged accounts first?,"It is my understanding that gains from bonds are taxed as income while gains from stocks are taxed as capital gains. However, bonds grow less during good times and lose less during bad times.

Since any gains aren't taxed in tax advantaged accounts, wouldn't it make sense to put stocks in these accounts? Despite the fact that gains from bonds are generally taxed more, they don't gain as much.

In tax advantaged accounts, when stocks go up, the gains aren't taxed. Similarly, when stocks go down, I can save more from taxes by reporting capital gains loss. In either case, it seems that bonds are less tax efficient since they don't move as much.

Is this thinking correct or completely wrong?

My post was removed by the mods there.  Don't know why.  The content of my original post is the same as below.  I linked to there because there are a lot of good questions.  I'm traveling tomorrow so won't have much time to answer any questions but I'll get to them the following day.  Not sure if this is suited for /r/investing.  If it isn't let me know and I'll remove it.

[Proof](http://imgur.com/a/7v26i) (Most of the profits were made in the past 10 months. At the start of 2015 my account size was around $450k.  It's now at $807k)

Reason for this post

- I want to introduce XIV as an alternative to buying or trading stocks.  I've sworn off buying stocks.

Background

I am not a professional and undestand about 51% of the inner workings of XIV. I trade XIV on several accounts.  The proof I linked to is the biggest and is a retirement account so I can't withdraw without taking a penalty.  I have a cash 

account that is up 100% since 2015.  I trade my friend's cash account which is up 50% since last Nov.  I also help my father and a friend trade XIV.  Between us we've made 7 figures this past year.

History

I've been in the stock market since 1987.  Bought some mutual funds with my hard earned money when I was 17.  Black Monday promptly happened.  Didn't get back into the market until around 1995.  Rode the internet boom up and back down.  

Struggled through the 2000s with not much to account for.  Got into a Commodity Trading Advisor that does the strangle on the S&amp;P futures in 2008. It had amazing past performance and relied on the market trading in a range to make money. 

 This strategy didn't work so well with the Great Recession. Fortunately I remembered how the market behaved after a big crash so I invested my 401k in natural resource and then gold and had these returns:

- 2009 - 57.78%
- 2010 - 32.95%
- 2011 - 15.72%
- 2012 - 50.20%
- 2013 - 51.19%

compared to the S&amp;P500

- 2009 - 23.49%
- 2010 - 12.64%
- 2011 - 0.00%
- 2012 - 13.29%
- 2013 - 29.60%

With the bump, I moved $500k of my 401k to a self-directed account (I own a company so had this set up with the 401k plan).  For the next two years my trades again didn't go anywhere.  It wasn't until I read a reddit post about buying 

XIV after the market crashed a bit in 2014.  I researched it and began trading.  It went surprisingly well.  Told my friend about it and he got on the game with his IRA account.

Rambling thoughts on the market

- As my friend said, the market is the devil.  You'll go to the grave and still won't figure it out.
- No one knows what the market will do.  Those who say they do are liars and/or are probably trying to sell you something.
- Investing based on fundamentals has never worked out for me.  
- Investing based on technicals has never worked out for me.  
- Diversifng my 401k never worked for me.  It wasn't until I started putting my entire 401k into a single fund in 2009 that I started getting amazing returns.
- I advise people who don't want to or can't actively trade to put their money in an index fund.  While history has shown this to be relatively safe there are still risk.

Basic strategy on trading XIV

- Wait for a ""crisis"" that brings the market down.
- Buy XIV
- Wait
- Profit
- Repeat

These crises (opportunities) happens a few times a year.  When it does the VIX spikes above 25 which is a good buy signal.

I'm not going to say I'm some sort of genius with my timing but so far whatever I'm doing it's working to a certain extent. For example, I bought XIV late last year and then the oil crash brought down the market.  I had a huge paper loss 

but was confident the market would recover.  It took months and I got out with $110k profit ~20%. Traded a bit but then got out before Brexit happeneded.  Afterwards, I was a bit nervous and waited too long to get into XIV but still made 

$140k profit (24%) in less than a month.

What I like about XIV

- It's not a company so no one is lying to you.  Not the company and not any of the analysts covering it.
- It most likely will not go down to 0.  Look at how [XIV behaved during the Great Recession](http://sixfigureinvesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/XIV-04-14.jpg). It recovered in a couple of years.  Some companies never did or went 

bankrupted.
- It benefits from contango.

What scares me about XIV

- The prospectus states that Credit Suisse reserves the right to close the fund if its intraday loss goes beyond 80%.  On 8/24/15, the DOW intraday dropped 1,089 points (7.1%).  VIX rose 90% yet XIV **ONLY** dropped 34%. It would take the crash of '87 to terminate XIV but the market now has breakers in place that suppose to prevent this.
- If I'm caught on the wrong side of the trade, it may take months to be profitable again. I don't use stop orders if I have a paper loss.  My reasoning is the market will eventually recover and/or volatility will die down.

Edit:  I'm heading out on a road trip.  Won't be back until tonight or early tomorrow morning.  A lot of great discussion here.  ",572
16-08-10,4x22yb,"Valeant outlines amendment request, sets lender call for 3 p.m. EDT","Valeant Pharmaceuticals International has scheduled a lender call for 3 p.m. EDT today to discuss its proposed amendment request, which would boost pricing in exchange for relaxing its interest-coverage covenant, sources said.

Ahead of this afternoon’s call, terms of the amendment proposal were circulating among lenders. The company is seeking to relax its interest-coverage covenant to 2x for the life of the deal, according to sources. The test is currently set at 2.75x per an amendment inked earlier this year that provided the company with an additional quarter-turn of headroom for one year, but is scheduled to step up to 3x in the second quarter of 2017.

Lenders are offered a 25 bps consent fee, while the spread on all four tranches of the company’s institutional and pro rata loans would increase by 50 bps from the current pricing grid, which is tied to senior secured leverage.
The margin on the C and E term loans would move to L+450, the spread on the TLF would increase to L+475, and the spread on the TLD would step up to L+425, while all four tranches of institutional loans include a 0.75% LIBOR floor. The spread on the pro rata loans would increase to L+375.

In addition, the amendment allows the company to issue secured bonds with a five-year tenor, provided the proceeds are used to repay term debt. It would also lift a cap limiting asset sales to 4% of total assets per year.

According to the terms of the company’s amendment that was inked in April, the reinvestment period for asset sales is eliminated until the company is in compliance with its financial reporting covenants—a condition the company has since satisfied—and leverage falls below 4.5x (for additional details, see “Valeant debt extends gains as co. nets amendment approval,” LCD News, April 7, 2016).

The loans are also governed by a 2.5x secured leverage covenant, which is not being altered as part of the amendment.
Administrative agent Barclays is running the amendment process, and consents are due by 2 p.m. EDT on Aug. 17.

CEO Joseph Papa disclosed plans to seek the amendment on an earnings call yesterday, pointing out the company is currently in compliance with its financial covenants, but noting that the cushion of compliance is not as large as he would like it to be.

The company also said it is evaluating strategic alternatives for some of its non-core business and geographies that represent more than $2 billion in revenue. Based on what the firm has seen for comparable asset sales, and some unsolicited indications of interest, these assets could represent a transaction value of up to $8 billion, based on a weighted average 11x EBITDA multiple, according to the company.

“What we've tried to do in thinking about the use of these proceeds is that in addition to some of the EBITDA generation from our cash, we do believe that we can certainly pay down… at least $5 billion over the next 18 months and potentially [this] could be higher if we sell all $8 billion,” Papa said, according to a transcript of the earnings call provided by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.

The company’s debt and shares advanced on the news, with the TLF due 2022—currently priced at L+425, with a 0.75% floor—running up to a par context, up nearly 1.5 points from prior to the news, according to sources. The company’s shares, which trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker VRX, ended the day up more than 25%, at $28.16.

As of June 30, Valeant—the second-largest issuer of performing loans in the S&amp;P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index—had approximately $10.44 billion of term debt outstanding, including nearly $8.2 billion of institutional loans, SEC filings show. The company has roughly $31 billion of total debt.

For the second quarter, the company reported adjusted EBITDA of about $1.09 billion, down from $1.39 billion in the year-ago period, and slightly below the S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence consensus forecast for $1.12 billion. However, the company affirmed its full-year 2016 guidance, forecasting adjusted EBITDA in a range of $4.8–4.95 billion, revenue in a range of $9.9–10.1 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $6.60–7.00.

Valeant is rated B/B2. The term loans are rated BB-/Ba2, with a 1 recovery rating from S&amp;P Global Ratings. — Kerry Kantin

I'm hoping I can get some help here. I purchased Relypsa a while ago in hopes of a buyout. That time appears to be here, much lower than I was hoping, but still a profit. I'm not super active in the stock market but have been learning.

This morning I received an email from tdameritrade about the buyout and I'm not sure what I need to do next. 

A TENDER OFFER for RELYPSA, INC. by VIFOR PHARMA USA INC.


Your position in the above security has a Voluntary Corporate Action for

TL;DR: When a buyout takes place, what needs to be done with my stock holdings? Do I sell now? Do I sit on the stock and just receive payment in full for the buyout price once it completely goes through? I'd much rather pay the commission price to sell than a 38 dollar processing fee.

16-08-10,4x3f7e,My shitty amateur technical analysis of AMD.,"I've been keeping up with AMD for a while. The price movement in the last two weeks has been pretty large in both directions and I'd like to give this board some of my insight.

Which for all intense and purposes is mostly useless, but take it as you will.

AMD had been trading above it's 50 SMA from August 3rd until this Monday afternoon where it has since hovered around it's 50 SMA until yesterday where it took some loses, and today.

However, the LAST time AMD dropped below it's 50 SMA was on July 1st. After it passed its 50 SMA on the downside it took a huge dip the following week which ended in the middle of the day on Tuesday (August 2nd, my birthday faggots) where it's begun it's run up until this Monday.

My point being is that the last time AMD took a dip like this, it made a run up afterwards.

Take a look [here](http://imgur.com/a/CCpHU)

The 50 SMA is in green, 100 SMA in orange, POI circled in red, and the blue line is movement/prediction. Give me your thoughts that I probably won't listen to anyway.

EDIT:

Looking back a few months we actually see the same pattern before their HUGE pop.

16-08-10,4x3ycm,SunEdison gets baseline offer for alternative-energy projects,"#SunEdison gets baseline offer for alternative-energy projects

SunEdison has secured a $144 million offer for some of its solar- and wind-power projects as it continues to shed assets.

In a motion filed yesterday with the Manhattan court overseeing its Chapter 11 case, the company asked for approval of bid procedures that name NRG Energy stalking-horse bidder for the equity of those units that own the alternative energy projects, which are located in California, Hawaii, Maine, Texas, Utah, and Washington.

In the motion, the company said it needs to move quickly to close the deal before the value of its business declines further.

The company said its investment bank, Rothschild, had reached out to nearly 350 potential buyers for the assets, and set up a data room for 112 interested parties.

Under the proposed sale procedures, NRG would be entitled to expense reimbursement up to a $4.5 million cap and a $5.5 million breakup fee if it is not the ultimate buyer.

Interested parties would have until Sept. 6 to submit alternate offers. If necessary, an auction would take place on Sept. 9, and a sale hearing on Sept. 15.

A hearing on the bid procedures is set for Aug. 18.

SunEdison is divesting other assets while in bankruptcy. Tomorrow, the company will appear before Judge Stuart Bernstein to ask for clearance to sell its Australia business to Flextronics International USA for $8.7 million, according to a July 21 motion.

Also tomorrow, the company will ask for the Manhattan court to extend its exclusivity and solicitation periods through Dec. 17 and Feb. 15, 2017, respectively.

The company said it has made progress in its case by continuing with a sale process of the aforementioned solar and wind power projects, as well as securing final approval to tap a $300 million DIP.

As reported, the company has also hired John Dubel as chief executive officer following the resignation of Ahmad Chatila.

The company intends to develop a key-employee-retention and sales-incentive program and a Chapter 11 plan.

“An extension of the exclusive periods will allow the debtors to maintain a controlled environment within which they can continue to market and sell projects and downsize the organization while working together with their constituents toward a plan of reorganization focused around a core group of assets,” the company said in the July 21 motion.

SunEdison filed for bankruptcy on April 21. — Kelsey Butler

So fee's for Vanguard's S&amp;P 500 ETF are rock bottom, the tracking error is limited, there's no use of *dodgy* derivatives and where the fund makes money on the side, via stock lending, it returns 100% of the incremental earnings to the Fund. 

|Metrics|Expense Ratio| Tracking Error|Uses Derivatives|Stock Lending Fees|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Vanguard's S&amp;P 500 $VOO | 0.05% | -0.04% | No | 100% to Fund :) |
|SPDR's $SPY | 0.09% | -0.07% | No | 100% to Fund :) |
|iShares' $IVV | 0.07% | -0.05% | No | 70% to Fund :/ |
|An all US $VTI | 0.05% | -0.01% | No | 100% to Fund :) |
|A global $VT | 0.14% | -0.09% | No | 100% to Fund :) |

# Asset Allocation

Obviously it's all in equities! But what's the split versus a Mid Cap ETF like the VXF or the Total Market e.g. VTI? Well... it's more tech and less financials / more healthcare and less industrials. 

|ETF| VOO | VXF | VTI |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Basic Materials| 3% | 5% | 2% |
|Energy| 7% | 4% | 7% |
|Industrials| 10% | 13% | 13% |
|Consumer Goods| 11% | 4% | 10% |
| Consumer Services| 12% | 15% | 13%|
| Financials| 16% | 26% | 19%|
| Health Care| 15% | 12% | 14%|
| Tech| 20% | 17% | 14%|
| Telecom| 3% | 1% | 3%|
| Utilities| 4% | 4% | 4%|


# Valuation

Let's compare Vanguard's S&amp;P 500 ETF to the Total US Market and the Global ETF.

|ETF| VOO | VTI | VT |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|No. of stocks| 507 | 3,650 | 7,495 |
|Median size| $77bn | $53 bn | $33bn |
|PE ratio| 21x | 22x | 21x |
|Earning growth| 7% | 7% | 7% |
| % foreign| 0% | 0% | 46%|

So effectively there's very little in terms of the valuation if you go for the US Total Market, instead. And if you go for the World ETF you are just going international, not getting an earnings or valuation boost.

# Well?

So looking at ETFs, I'd like to come to think of 3 questions:

1. Am I happy with the asset itself?
2. Am I happy with this specific strategy?
3. Am I happy with the provider of the ETF?

Well, this is a equity ETF in the US. It's hard not to like that as an asset. Though to some extent, I get worried when I keep seeing headlines that the S&amp;P is hitting all time highs. :(

In terms of a large-cap v. mid-cap. US v. global, there really doesn't seem to be any clear blue water between them. I don't get the feeling that large-cap or US has any better or worse outlook than any other strategy.

And finally, what about Vanguard... well it's hard to fault their metrics in terms of cost, efficiency or safety. Seems to be a least as good as SPDR or iShares.

16-08-10,4x4sdo,"Insiders' take on $CMG","TLDR: Spend an hour on chipotlesucks.com, to get an idea of how the company really operates, before you decide to buy, hold, or sell $CMG.

I was a kitchen manager for them for the better part of a year. The company is just terrible in so many ways. But nothing I could write here would be anything that hasn't already been brought up at chipotlesucks.com. I highly encourage all of you interested in $CMG as an investment to spend an hour or two on that website, reading the stories with an open mind, not predisposing yourself to mock them, ridicule them as lazy, whiny, or whatever. Please understand that most of the posts made on that forum are genuine expressions of a very common experience former chipotle team members, KMs, SMs, Apprentices, and even GMs, go through. The great majority of us went into the job (myself a couple weeks after graduating college with a bachelors in history intent on working my way up through their management track) with high expectations of making a good experience working to help propagate a brand we already loved. And then we actually got hired. And at some point, sooner or later, we all came to understand the true nature of chipotle.

This is a truly arrogant top-down company, governed by a corporate management structure which simply does not work effectively, and compounds that problem by also blatantly ignoring any problems or concerns sent up the chain of command from the bottom. One time, one of the head honchos out of Denver (she was at the head of the HR department and actually admitted to me she never actually managed a restaurant) came in and ripped me a new asshole because I was the closing manager and the place was a fucking chaotic mess I admit. The reason was because we were two people short that night AND we totally blew past our sales projections that night. We were slammed, and therefore our labor percentage that night was ridiculously low. But I got my ass chewed out three different times because there was food and shit all over the floor. This is just one example of how rigid and impractical this company is. The bean counters running the company from Denver make all the decisions regardless of what the realities on the ground are. When shit rolls down the hill, it stops at the bottom. And any failure to  perform flawlessly in such a situation is met with a stern rebuke. 

I don't see any reason why a dual-CEO system cannot work in theory. But Steve and Monty have proven it can really be a recipe for disaster. Without getting too specific (again, think of this post as a TLDR and go spend some time at chipotlesucks.com), I will say that I personally and frequently was put in situations where  I'd be given conflicting information from different store managers while I was still a team member. After becoming a KM, my GM would tell me one thing, and his boss would then tell me I was wrong for doing it the way my GM told me. That is, on the rare occasions the district manager would even bother to show up at our store. Or I'd be trained one way, then told by the same person that the policy had changed, and then a week later, I got grilled by a manger from a different store for not doing it the way I was taught the first time. Typical experiences as a chipotle employee involve constant conflicts of information that make it impossible for a store to be completely effective in executing a uniform food production system. No one was ever 100% on the same page about all food prep guidelines. 

And at this point you might be thinking, ""hahaha this dumbass kid thinks what he is saying isn't already true about a lot of restaurants"". Now, in reality, I actually have a decent bit of restaurant management experience under my belt for a 26yo. And I can tell you, albeit anecdotally, that chipotle is much much worse than any similar experience you had when you worked in a restaurant.

Ultimately, all of this leads to food-born illnesses and product inconsistencies, both of which do damage to the brand.

How so? Again, I could write out a detailed explanation of how the cilantro was wantonly mishandled and almost never refrigerated (which it is suppose to be, to prevent ecoli) during my tenure at a location that typically did between 6&amp;10k dollars in sales on an average day. If you're on grill during the lunch or dinner rush, you just have way too much on your plate to bother running back and forth from the walk-in for the cilantro whenever you had to use it (which is pretty much every 5-15minutes depending on what you're making). 

Or I could tell you about how we were given impossible food prep guidelines where we were expected to do way more than humanly possible. I mean, yea I could once in a blue moon be able to dice up 3-4 pounds of jalapeños BY HAND in about 40 minutes, IF I was well rested AND totally jacked up on adderrall (which I frequently had to do in order to keep up with the heavy demands of the job). But by no means, was this anything an average able bodied adult can do day in, day out, on a regular basis. What ends up happening in reality, is we would just take shortcuts. For example, we really tried to dice up as much jalapeños(3-4) and onions (5-10 lbs per day) as we could. But when we inevitably fell short pretty much every day, we just put whatever amount we had managed to get done into the salsas, Guac, etc. Some days it would be 1/3rd the amount of japs and onions that were suppose to go into the recipes. Some days it could be as little as 1/10th. At some point, we all stopped caring to try, except on days when the GM came in early to supervise. When he did not, we didn't give a damn. The quotas were basically impossible, and on the rare occasion we tried to explain this to the GM or his bosses....well, let's just say it didn't end well for the poor, brave souls who stepped up.

In summation: The chaotic, unresponsive corporate chain of command leads to (1) food born illness via improper food handling, because employees' workload is so demanding that there's not enough time to follow proper techniques, and (2) an inconsistent product, thus dissatisfying customers, due to shortcuts being taken for the same reason as the improper food handling...an unreasonable workload which very few adults are able to handle for any long stretch of time. The big take away you should get from my incredibly biased rant, is that these food born illnesses and product inconsistencies will not stop until chipotle finds a new [sole]CEO to take over and initiate a drastic overhaul of the corporate structure, one where more pragmatic corporate officers are responsive to the reality on the ground. Until then, $CMG will continue to experience a gradual loss of regular customers.

Until then, do not buy or hold. Sell, sell, sell.",2

16-08-11,4x931e,JCP,"Gather around you degenerate gamblers and I'll tell you a story. As you know, JCP has been in the shitter for years, however, this is changing. In 2011, apple executive Ron Johnson was hired as JCPs CEO to lead the company through change, invigorate the stores, and expand to a younger customer base. He failed miserably and was replaced by the former CEO to stabilize the company. Once that was completed, Marvin Ellison was brought in from Home Depot. Having a relative who has worked for JCP through each of these periods, Johnson made it an absolute shit show and Ellison is the future.

The company took on a TON of debt to finance store changes, a discount based sales structure was abandoned, and older customers were shunned while trying to attracted the younger generation, leading to huge losses in revenue. You see a rise in other retailers, Macy's kohls etc. that took market share from JCP. Now you see a flip, JCP taking back market share at the expense of Macy's and kohls, and they will continue to take more. Just look at their charts and Marvin ellisons comments about taking back market share.

Everyone talks about the grim outlook of retailers. JCP has been dealing with this for years and have made the appropriate store closures and has adapted over the past two years to save the company from bankruptcy. Whereas today you see Macy's is announcing store closures and others are just now reacting to weak demand. JCP has been dealing with this shit and is already a step ahead of everyone else.

JCP has increased their online presence, announced 60+ more sephora makeup store additions, aggressive discounting, converted to more stand alone stores instead of shitty mall locations, and have rolled out appliances to raise margins.

The company has stabilized by generating cash flow from huge discounts and slimming down total inventory on hand, now they are going in for the kill by investing in higher margin products and services to generate income and not just operate at a lower loss than the previous quarter. Sears will go bankrupt and JCP is in a position to take all their appliance market share. Sephora yields high margins for the company and is expanding to more stores, JCP salon has struck a deal with InStyle magazine and became a trendy salon, and the older penny pinchers have been brought back in the door with coupons and sales.

JCP killed it in 2015 leading to higher price targets and a run up to $12 a share. After a lackluster Q1 in retail, many companies missed earnings and lowered yearly guidance. JCP missed in revenue, but they hit their bottom line and kept their year end EBITDA target. Ballsy move for a company with a lot of debt to promise investors that. With tomorrow's earnings I see an increase in profit margins, meeting revenue estimates, And possibly increasing guidance as a result.

TLDR: Buy sept 16 calls with $11 strike. They will beat, momentum will carry them to $11 and analyst upgrades will be icing on the cake.",15

Would it make sense to just put 90% of everything you have into index funds at 30 if you don't have any needed expenses?

&gt; Hmm, should I buy this? Do I really need it? Nah, I can live without it, it won't me any money, I'll just put it in the index.

&gt; Hmm, new shoes? I can live with old ones, into the index it goes.

After third contact asking about algo-trading, broker said, that I need to make less changes to orders and should essentially pay the market price that's being offered. Changing orders too many times is not allowed. Otherwise they might cut me off from the markets. 

I don't have enough experience if this is some unwritten policy but for me it sounds that there are different rules. I haven't done any simultaneous buy/sell orders or anything that can be interpreted as order book manipulation. They also did not provide exact instructions what's allowed and what's not, just that ""make less changes"".

Just wanted to share this gem with you,

**AcelRx Pharmaceuticals Inc** is soon to release its promising results on their two major drugs:

ARX-04 - Phase 3 for both EU and US

Zalviso - Phase 3 for US, already approved in EU

They are posed to release the results of their Phase 3 study for ARX-o4, the company has solid products and the only reason Zalviso failed to be approved last time was not to do with the efficacy of the drug but rather with its dispensing mechanism.

Monday is going to be the release of the front-line data, but the reception has been fantastic.

&gt;Zalviso has completed three Phase 3 clinical trials: two placebo-controlled efficacy and safety trials and one open-label active comparator trial, in which Zalviso was compared to IV PCA morphine. Each of the three Phase 3 trials successfully achieved its primary endpoint.

Their Zalviso in Europe is spreading across the continent.

&gt;In Europe, Grünenthal continues to make progress and has introduced Zalviso in Germany, France, the UK, Italy and Belgium. Zalviso has been used by several hundred patients in dozens of hospitals. Patients, nurses and doctors have provided positive qualitative feedback on their initial experience. Grünenthal plans to launch Zalviso in the Netherlands, Ireland and Portugal by the end of the year.

The company has 60% ownership by the institutions, insiders have been buying up the company stock, with one of the most prominent investors being the Department of Defence.

Lots of good things are coming for this company, Monday is the big release/catalyst.

For example: I bought NFLX when dipped at $84.5 and sold at $94.5, resulted STCG.

In short, the ROI on stocks is 5.25% on holding part (LTCG) while 2% return belongs to sold part (STCG).

STCG is 33% IRS+9.3% California tax. 

I do not use bond just stocks and etfs alone.

How do you think this will effect the earnings report being released today? My finger is itching to sell, but part of me thinks none of this will matter on a stock thats already over bought as it is and the demand is still high, thus stock will get to $70 by December. ",2

Oh no... another tech IPO that didn't shine :( $FIT IPOed at $20, ramping to nearly $48 and now it's at $15, with some of the insiders *dumping* stock at $29 when the lock-ups expired.

So have the IPO luvies capitulated and forgotten about $FIT, now that more than 12 months have past?

# Description
Fitbit is a provider of health and fitness devices. The Company's platform combines connected health and fitness devices with software and services, including an online dashboard and mobile applications, data analytics, motivational and social tools, personalized insights and virtual coaching through customized fitness plans and interactive workouts. 

## Recent financials 

So the year to 2015 was a phenomenon with sales nearly tripling. And the 1st half of 2016 hasn't been shoddy either, with sales up to $1.1bn from $0.7bn in first half 2015. They sold 10.5m devices too. 

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $1.9bn | $0.7bn | $0.3bn | $0.1bn | $0.01bn|
|EPS | $0.75 | $0.63 | -$1.32 | -$0.11 | -$0.12|

And the operational metrics are impressive too.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Devices sold | 21m | 11m | 4m | 1m | 0.2m|
|Active users | 17m | 7m | 3m | N/A | N/A|

But clearly with the stock down so much you'd imagine they've been missing their quarterly numbers? Well, no! Consensus is for sales of $2.6bn for the year (no change in the forecast in last couple months) and EPS not budged either. Oh... how sentiment can kill. Perhaps the $GPRO debacle overshadows them?

## Competition

From their annual:

&gt; The market for connected health and fitness devices is both evolving and competitive...specialized consumer electronics...traditional health and fitness companies...traditional watch companies...many large, broad-based consumer electronics companies.

It's a long list of names: Garmin, Jawbone, Misfit, adidas, Under Armour, Fossil, Movado, Apple, Google, LG, Microsoft, Samsung and Xiaomi.
 
Looking at margins and returns, they aren't in the world of the software giants. So, it's not like there is fat that the competition is going after, is there?

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Fitbit Inc | $2,213M | 11% | 13%
Garmin Ltd. | $2,897M | 23% | 16%
Under Armour Inc | $4,423M | 12% | 15%
adidas AG | €16,915M | 9% | 12%
Movado Group, Inc | $589M | 14% | 10%
Apple Inc. | $220,288M | 34% | 38%
Alphabet Inc | $81,761M | 33% | 15%
GoPro Inc | $1,241M | -ve | -ve
Amer Sports Oyj | €2,534M | 10% | 14%

## Cash / Debt?

Fitbit Inc has $759M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 23% of the market value of Fitbit Inc. So they've got some flexibility :)

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $21.38 for Fitbit Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 42% to their target. Which is pretty nice upside.

# Valuation

Now it's almost funny that it trades on the same PE ratio as Apple. Are they really both ex-growth? 

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/fit/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|

GRMN.O | $10,403M | 22x | 7% | 4% | 9%
UA | $16,220M | 67x | 24% | 0% | 3%

GPRO.O | $1,972M | -ve | -ve | 0% | -ve
AMEAS.HE | €3,004M | 20x | 15% | 2% | 8%

# Dividends

Fitbit Inc is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. And given this is really the start of the IoT / wearables market, I'm okay with that. Would like to see them investing. 

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 11% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 1%. On a 6 month basis the stocks up 4% with earnings up 20% and on a 1 year basis the stock is down 66% even though the earnings are up 60%. 

So the sentiment's gone against them. Imagine, the stock's PE ratio's gone from 55x to 13x :( For me the decline in sentiment is shocking. 

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/fit/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers. As management tell it, there are no dark clouds:

&gt; We remain optimistic for the second half of the year. As James mentioned, we expect to enter the holiday season with the most compelling lineup of new products than any previous holiday period. For Q3 we expect revenue of $490 million to $510 million, gross margins of 48% to 49%, EPS of $0.17 to $0.19

So...is this the next $GPRO? Let's look at the history there. The stock nearly hit $100 by end 2014 after it's IPO and was trading at 100x earnings. But growth hit the wall and losses soon followed. 

|$GPRO | 2017E|2016E|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Devices | N/A | N/A | 7m | 5m | 4m| 2m  | 1m|
|Revenue | $1.7bn | $1.4bn | $1.6bn | $1.4bn | $1.0bn| $0.5bn | $0.2bn|
|EPS | -$0.35 | -$1.09 | $0.25 | $0.92 | $0.47 | $0.07 | $0.24 |

So if $FIT is going to face the same wall in 4Q this year, then yes...maybe it's another $GPRO. On the other hand, maybe there's lots of growth left in this stock. 

Anyone got a view?

16-08-11,4xae7o,Investing: There are so many resources but no guidance/structure for beginners to become advanced.,"Whenever there's a new post from a beginner about books he/she should read to learn more about investing etc, everyone recommends books like The intelligent investor, you can be a stock market genius etc..

I was able to get my hands on one of those books. I started reading, but after a few pages, you'd realize that you don't understand these books because you have no accounting knowledge, no knowledge of macro economics etc etc....

The only solution to these problem is there should be a structure to learning about investing instead of having multiple random books thrown at you.

For example in math class, the structure is:

    Introduction to algebra

    Intermediate algebra

    Calculus 1

    Calculus 2 etc

The idea is that you can't jump to calculus 1 without knowing algebra

I think there should be a clear structure when it comes to learning investing as well. e.g

    Learn accounting principles

    Learn micro and macro economics etc.

I'm a beginner and i feel so frustrated because there is no guidance, everyone says the same thing...like read The intelligent investor.

I and thousands of beginner investors would really appreciate it if someone took time out of their busy schedule to create a structure for beginners like myself.

If you know very good beginner friendly books as well. Please share.

Thanks for reading.

16-08-11,4xag1p,Daily NUGT Trading Lesson,"So every one of my NUGT trades have been correct since I started running my strategy last Tuesday. I'm up $5k or so on an investment of $2k (check my other threads on the NUGT for basic info and a video showing transaction history). I have asked in a couple threads whether you guys would be interested in talking about the NUGT every day and got moderate interest.

So here's today's lesson. But first let me preface this by saying that I had experimented and backtested various NUGT trading strategies before actually running my final strategy. As it's a new strategy, I still have many problems to iron out.

One example is that the strategy didn't initially determine the option buying strategy, just to go long or short. But on two days, my orders were not filled. NUGT is not exactly the most liquid of ETFs.

What I've learned from this is the following:
1. Avoid monthly options; play weeklies
2. Avoid ""odd"" strike prices (e.g., 154)
3. Complex orders (e.g., 4 different options) are hard to fill even if the contracts in question are liquid

So as we roll into Friday, here's today's lesson:

1. Determine your option by budget. If you plan on spending $X today, find the option that costs X/2 and round to the nearest strike ending with 5 or 0.
2. Aim to buy two of those.
3. Enter your order with a limit order 40 cents below the midpoint.
4. Slowly change your limit order, moving it toward the midpoint in 10 cent increments until filled.
5. TODAY'S LESSON:

Most NUGT option prices are primarily time premium. Fridays are the exceptions. On these days, your weekly contract acts much more like stock, assuming you are playing ITM options.

For this reason, a probabilistic strategy such as the one I am using, is risky on Fridays. Thus, I recommend you reduce your budget on Friday trades, except for those opened with the next week's weeklies. Your money management system should set your Friday NUGT budget as the lowest for the week; the method I use ensures you will never go broke.

Remember that option time decay accelerates on Friday, especially as we approach 4pm, to compensate for the weekend. Volatility is crushed as well. Thus, selling at market open and buying at market close is recommended.

Questions welcome.

Oh! And I'll be creating a free chat room on NUGT trading, where I teach my strategy and state my daily trades. I want to keep the number of members low, but if you're interested shoot me an email.

And a final note: Someone asked me why go short on NUGT and not long on DUST. Two reasons:
1. Shorting NUGT gives you more movement in terms of magnitude.
2. 3x ETF (e.g., NUGT and DUST) naturally decay over time, so short positions are better than long, all things being equal.",36

16-08-11,4xajpg,Gold,"Good afternoon gents,

A low-class fag here got a question for you gents. 

1. Was there a specific reason why gold futures price suddenly dropped today near the close of market?

2. What are your predictions/thoughts about gold's movement tomorrow?

3. Could you please provide me with a list of events that might affect the gold price in August, 2016? (I.E. Unemployment rate, jobless claims, etc etc) 

4. Im a 24-yo noob trying to make money in the market. I started with $7,450 on 6/28/2016 and i am at $12,000 as of market close today. I made gains in the beginning by doing some research in certain industries (ones i am more familiar with) and trading stocks. Lately (starting 2 weeks ago) I started trading 3x leveraged ETFs as well and surprisingly, I broke even for past 2 weeks. So my last question to you gents is.. And i know theres no set answer to this question. What do you think is the best investment strategy for fags in my shoes? (24 yo, ~10k capital, new to investing, not familiar with options yet). Im talking about long-term investment strategies as I plan to be involved in stock market until my brain stops functioning. 

I will appreciate all of your comments, if any. If no comments, ill GFM. If there are comments, ill still GFM. 

Hope all of your stocks gain a shit ton tomorrow.

Relatively new to investing, just saw this stock $SAEX . Down 16% today ,due to a slightly worse Q2 in my opinion, and a lot more than the beginning of 2016. Current price is 14,50, while not so long ago it traded for 300-400 dollars and a couple of years ago even &gt;1000,-. 
On first sight I would say the current price is definitely undervalued, due to bearish looks on oil industry etc. What are your opinions about the potential growth when oil prices rise?",5

Yes, companies and startups focusing on gene engineering and growing like mushrooms after rain.

16-08-12,4xbinv,Question about my NVDA calendar spread.,"So I have a calendar spread on NVDA with the following legs. (2) write Aug12 60 Calls, and (2) buy Sep09 60 Calls. Earnings were released and I expected things to stay fairly flat but increase slightly over the next few weeks. After hours NVDA closed at $61.12. I sold the Aug12 expiry when IV was around 157% and that's right around what it topped at today, so obviously tomorrow it will drop quite a bit. My Sep09 calls were sitting around 45% IV. So if I get assigned tomorrow I would buy the Aug12 60 call and exercise it correct? If it stays somewhat flat I would be purchasing the calls at a much lower premium due to the lower IV correct? Netting the difference and holding on to my Sep09 calls? I also have the choice of exercising my Sep09 calls or selling the entire spread itself correct?

I'm new to legged trades and mostly stick with long calls/puts.

I would greatly appreciate any advice, thanks!

Quick disclaimer: I typically refrain from Valeant positions. Valeant sucks as a company and may or may not go bankrupt in the coming years. Anyone that holds this stock for more than a few hours is at risk of getting burned. With that said..

The only people that are more fucked than Ball Sackman and Joe Papa are they people that loaned Valeant 31 billion dollars. Currently, Valeant is unable to move forward with their ""redemption"" plan because their debt covenants only allow them to sell up to 4% of assets. 

Valeant has reached out to their debt holders to renegotiate the terms to drop the interest coverage ratio (increasing their EBITA cushion), and allowing them to start selling assets with the promise that the cash will go towards secured debt. They have until Wednesday Aug 17th to respond, and they only need 50% approve for the amendment. 25% are already in approval. 

Considering Valeant just got sodomized by the WSJ article, any good news will cause a pop. The debt holders can't afford not to amend the terms because If Valeant were to tank there'd be billions left on the table that they'd never get back. 

Between Monday-Wednesday the stock will pop 5-10%. The wise will sell immediately, the retards will hold and become bag holders again.

Motion : Cardiaq – trade secrets 1 – 3 retrial – 
Motion : Neovasc – trade secrets 4 – 6 retrial –

Neovasc won trade secrets claims 1 – 3 and Cardiaq won 4- 6 both parties want a retrial for the areas they lost.  Both parties already had motions for judgement as a matter of law to change the ruling denied.  They have now asked for a retrial.
The judge upheld the verdict as a matter of law I do not foresee she is lightly to grant a retrial to either party.  Both parties’ present valid evidence but neither presents anything fundamentally new.  

Prediction: Both motions will be denied.

Cardiaq – Motion - advanced damages –

Cardiaq is requesting advanced damages but the jury already decided the damages cardaiq won 3 of the 6 trade secret claims they requested 125m but was awarded 70m.  They lost several of the trade secrets claims so could not expect a full award.  Also I do not foresee the judge granting advance payment until all issues in the case are resolved. 

Prediction : Deny : will support jury’s original verdict 

Cardiaq – Motion - permanent injunction - 

A plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) that it has suffered an irreparable injury; 
(2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury; 
(3) that, considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and 
(4) that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.

1.	This is debatable I do not believe the burden is meet but this is a lot more subjective than the other points. 

2.	Already received financial compensation can only request a permanent injunction if financial compensation is not adequate.  Cardiaq asked for financial compensation they should have asked for an injunction with original complaint.  They received adequate financial compensation awarded by the jury 

3.	balance of hardship the injunction hurts Neovasc a lot more the cardiaq .   I do not believe that a small company like Neovasc has caused a giant like Edwards such hardship.

4.	Public interest – Neovasc serves patients cardiaq does not and could potentially save their lives it is the public interest for Neovasc to continue. 

The burden of proof lies with Cardiaq I believe they fail to meet this burden of proof on more than out of the points.  I believe Cardiaq is being greedy and chancing its arm.  I believe Cardiaq would prefer this judgement was not on Monday as they were looking to benefit from the uncertain it causes.

Prediction : Deny 




Neovasc : Motion : Retrial on damages 

This one I am unsure of although I do not believe Neovasc will get awarded a retrial on trade secrets I believe there is a 50% chance they get a retrial on damages.  

Neovasc makes a strong legal case that cardiaq experts process in calculating damage was fundamentally wrong  they use 2015 data to calculate their request when damages must be calculated using 2010/2011 data when the damage was actually occurred.  Negotiations are suppose to be consider as if they happened at the time not based on later figures.  
How the damages were calculated was not at the heart of the original complaint the main argument was to establish if trade secrets were misappropriated.

Neovasc are more or less saying Ok you said I misappropriate the trade secrets 4-6 however the way in which the damages were calculated are not legally sound and too high we would like a retrial on this specific issue. 

Prediction : flip a coin 

Summary. 

Both parties are effectively looking to appeal every area they lost through motions. I think fundamentally not much changes.   I believe the judge will support the jury’s original verdict she will not grant a retrial on trade secrets for either party, not grant advanced damages and crucially for Neovasc not grant a permanent injunction.  I fundamentally do not believe cardiaq puts forward a strong case for an injunction and believe Neovascs counter is very strong. 

Retrial on damages – As I said this is a coin flip and I don’t even want to . 

What Neovasc needs to happen? 

Neovasc needs the injunction motion to be denied if this does not happen this is a disaster for Neovasc it effectively means the project goes on hold for 18 months the order also prevents Neovasc from selling tiara unless the company buying agrees to the order.  This result combined with upholding of the 70m would effectively spell a financial nightmare for Neovasc possible bankruptcy I believe this is Edwards aim.  

However even this result  would not mean the absolute end for Neovasc as Neovasc would be valued at 70m fine plus around 20-30m market cap so say 100m.  Cardiaq was purchased for 400m by Edwards.  300m discount for 18 month delay  seems reasonable.  
 I also do not rule out Edwards or another firm buying Neovasc once it has crippled the company’s finances who doesn’t love a bargain? Especially when that bargain arguably produces a better product than you do. 

Anyway, I have strayed off into if, buts and maybes.   My personal opinion is Monday will be a good day for Neovasc and I will be holding my shares. 

All information I used to form my views can be found in the court documents I suggest anyone with a shareholding read them and please share your views on the matter -

DISCLAIMER : The views expressed in this article are my own personal views they are not legal or financial advice and should not be interpreted as such.  

As confirmed above I am an individual investor who holds a holding in Neovasc.

&gt;&gt;Katheryn Thayer: It seems like we’re never short on articles urging inexperienced investors to stick with ETFs and leave money in one place instead of trying to beat the market. Why is that so hard to do? How does Betterment change or add to that conversation?

&gt;&gt;Jon Stein: It’s because investing is really, really hard. We’re not evolved in a state where we had to think about what we’d do 30 years from now. We’re evolved in a state where if we ate tomorrow, things are pretty ok. We just worry about the short term. Our brains hyper-discount the future.

&gt;&gt;Finance, as a discipline, takes advantage of this human behavior — corrects for it. It helps us plan and think longer-term. But unless it’s your full-time job and you have all the best technology working for you, you’re just not going to be very good at it.

---------------------------------------------------------

My thoughts on this:


1. If investing is ""really, really hard"" for you, then you're probably just lazy.

2. No, you don't need to have a full time job in finance and have all the technology working for you to be very good at it.

Oil has ridden up from the bottoms and started to peak/head back down yesterday. Then some Saudi says they want to stabilize the price and we're right back to oil rally, right? Not so fast.

The price always moves on news from OPEC wether it be positive or negative, then the market usually remembers OPEC saying something vague about the future doesn't change current circumstance.

I think we're seeing that now and the price of oil will continue to go down in the short term. I don't think we've found the bottom quite yet or stable. I got in DWTI heavy this morning based on these observations.

16-08-12,4xesnb,Learning about options,"So just to clarify and make sure I'm on the same page as you faggots:

Company A is reporting earnings next week and is currently trading at $50.00 / share. I can purchase a call for whatever the price is per share (minimum 100 calls). I can choose a price that I think the stock will increase to within a certain time. For example, I think Company A will beat earnings next week and increase to $53.00 / share by Friday. If it increases to $53.00 / share or higher by Friday, I can then cash out and take my profits. If it doesn't get to $53.00, I'm out of my money.

The inverse applies for a put. I can predict Company B will miss earnings and decrease to a certain amount by a certain date and when it sinks low enough, I can cash out my profits.

16-08-12,4xexr0,The secret to success in the market,"Its not about the quality of DD.

It will always be about how you manage your skin in the game. Have the right amount in at the right time. The right time is when a loss will not hurt your account significantly.

we always talk about diversification, which just means dont put all your money into one basket. If you read between the lines, its a simple way of saying you cant predict the market.

aside from this, there are two other forma of diversification outside of assets - these are time and price.

Time diversification is you putting your money in at set points over the year to weather out any events that mightve drive your stock down for that time period. it also gives you an opportunity to reassess, without blowing your hard earn savings during a bad time in the market.

Price diversification - simply, dollar cost averaging.  except you use predetermined pivot points,calculated with IV and HV to plan your entries.you only put skin in the game at these specific points.

lastly, this all comes together under asset diversification- assigning only a certain % to each ticker. once youve reached that max %, you rebalance your portfolio if needed or look for another ticker to invest in.

now, this wont happen instantly. it will likely take a year to be fully invested. your gains wont be ""sexy"", but i guarantee that youll have an opportunity be more profitable consistently. you will be less stressed. your portfolio will be more sound.

For example, if you buy a stock with an annual dividend of 3%. If you make 3% within the month, why not take that 3% profit? Why not reduce your exposure until another opportunity arises- it will. you can even put money back into the same stock, except now, youll have a portion of that % of that as freeplay + expected dividend.

your ultimate goal should be to build a portfolio based on profits- free shares that collect dividends, while you remain liquid. ",9

Wouldn't any other company get completely crushed for these fundamentals? Is crude oil being ""talked up"" so that oil company insiders can sell their stock higher than it was before being ""talked up""? Isn't it best to watch for Form 4 selling by insiders to gauge the near term fundamental outlook rather than the ""talked up"" outlook?

LDOS is currently trading at $49.89 so those 401 shares are worth $20,005 which is a 50% profit after the share transition occurs. Now, LMT can cancel this for various reasons.

Additionally. LDOS is offering a special dividend of $13.64 per share. Record date is Monday 8/15. At the current share price that is like a 27% return with no change in stock price.

-they are going with the model of staying lean and scaling business size to demand

-added Chris Murphy who owns(?) star produce who produce hothouse tomatoes. Chris has access to lots of greenhouse space if necessary as well as distribution channels from existing infrastructure of largest tomato company

I like how this company seems to operate. With most of the mmj producers opting for a mega warehouse of space, it seems advantageous to me, to scale the business up as demand grows.

16-08-13,4xhc3k,Some thoughts on dividend scalping.,"I see a lot of talk around here about options. Options are great because they are volatile and volatility means that you can get a great return on small amounts invested. Unfortunately, this also means that they can easily become worthless if your direction is wrong. 

Plus, I'm a plebian faggot still trying to get options access on Fidelity (they only gave me covered calls when I first tried, now I'm trying to get Level 3 access). 

Which brings me to the subject I wish to discuss... dividend scalping. I've been doing this for the past few months with good success. Want some proof? See below:

http://imgur.com/QttvA0J

http://imgur.com/TXeYXLV

http://imgur.com/xUIyl4n

I made all of the trades within the past couple of weeks. I bought them a few days before ex-dividend, and sold once the stock had gotten back up to my basis (and then some, of course). 

Now, before you go out and start scalping dividends with your sub-$10,000 RH account, I do stress that in order for this to be worth the commission you are paying, you want to do this with at least $100,000. Preferably $150,000 and up. I've been rolling my dividends forward and use an upwards of $200,000 now. Compounding at work, yeah!

Why do you need so much capital for dividend scalping to be effective? Stock prices rarely have huge moves outside of earnings or other systemic events. 

The more capital you trade with, the less the stock has to move in order for you exit with a decently-sized absolute capital gain. 

Speaking of earnings, never scalp dividends off companies that have ex-dividend dates extremely close to earnings dates. See that Ford trade I showed as an example? The earnings date was right before I sold it. Had I held onto it, I would have had a 15% unrealized loss the next day. Earnings makes stocks volatile, and if you are scalping for dividends, volatility is your enemy since it can rip into your principal and force you to baghold, negating your ability to play upcoming ex-dividend dates on other stocks unless you want to realize a loss. 

That said, I never scalp dividends off of shitty, small, volatile companies, even if the dividend yield is good. Volatility is your enemy. I prefer to scalp dividends on large-cap blue chip stocks with solid fundamentals and a sustainable dividend payout ratio. Should the market crap out on me and force me to baghold a company for a while, at least I know the company is not a piece of shit and I would be comfortable ""investing"" in it for the ""long term"". 

Lastly, and most importantly, dividend scalping works best when the market is bullish (kind of like in times like these). When the market is crashing, sentiment is weak, and the VIX is hitting new highs, I retreat from dividend scalping altogether, sit on cash, and wait for the volatility to go away. Of course, in a long-term bear market, dividend scalping would never work unless you are shorting companies and writing covered puts (which is the opposite action, and something I've never tried). 

TLDR:

1. Dividend scalping works best if you have at least $100,000+.
2. Never try scalping when market sentiment is weak/negative.
3. Don't scalp the dividends of small, crappy, volatile companies, even if the yield is good. The larger the market cap and the lower the beta a company has, the better candidate it is for a scalping. 
4. Capital gains are good, but don't chase them too hard. You just need enough of a gain to get your principal back so that you scalp even more companies. ",8

""Last year, more than 11 million people bought coverage through the exchanges. While that figure beat the Obama administration’s expectations for 2016, it’s a huge drop from the Congressional Budget Office’s initial projections that 21 million would be enrolled by that time.""

""In the first two years of the healthcare law, more insurers than expected have ended up with balance sheets in the red.""

So, 50% less people are buying into the exchanges than projected? The insurance companies are losing money, and it looks like United Healthcare may consider pulling out of Obamacare. What would happen if Obamacare collapses? 

Would you in essence short health insurance companies under it? Private hospitals? Just trying to wrap my head around the fallout if it did and I keep imagining a bunch of unpaid or underpaid bills sitting in the system due to lack of funds. If that happens, I imagine we'd see a rise in personal bankruptcies as costs would be passed to the patients in the end.

Again, totally NOT meant to be political.

16-08-13,4xk3g0,"Why are market cap, outstanding shares, and closing prices not matching on stocks?","I'm building some software to practice my javascript and I need to take into account stock splits.  

Theoretically (or technically) a company's stock **price** should equal **market capitalization ÷ outstanding shares**, correct?  But I'm finding this is not true for many companies:

*For some companies like* **Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)***, the difference is likely due to rounding errors:*

* current price: 57.94
* market cap: 448.71 Billion
* outstanding: 7.79 Billion

        448,710,000,000 ÷ 7,790,000,000 = 57.60 (≈0.05% under)

*But for others, like* **Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)***, the numbers don't mesh:*

* current price: 783.22
* market cap: 545.34 Billion
* outstanding: 343.60 Million

        545,340,000,000 ÷ 343,600,000 = 1,587.13 (≈2x the price)

*Or* **Nintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY)**: 

* current price: 29.00
* market cap: 36.74 Billion
* outstanding: 127.88 Million

        36,740,000,000 ÷ 127,880,000 = 287.30 (≈10x the price)

*And* **Siemens AG (OTCMKTS:SIEGY)**:

* current price: 104.10
* market cap: 88.42 Billion
* outstanding: 777.62 Million

        88,420,000,000 ÷ 777,620,000 = 113.70 (≈ 9.0 % over)


So, what's going on here?  

How can I consistently calculate change in price by looking at market share and outstanding shares?  

And what is the best source for this information?  I'm currently using Google Finance, but its 4 or 5 significant figures may not be precise enough if a company splits or has sizeable market cap changes.",5

I am getting ready to buy a house and will be able to put 20% down from money I have in my saving account but wont have much left over so I still would like to take a little out of my TD account to add to my emergency fund.

My question is...Is there a certain way I should go about selling them for tax reasons or any other reasons? Should I sell ones I have lost money on first or ones I have gained on? Newer ones or older ones? I'm not sure if any of that really matters but I thought I remembered reading about how that can affect your taxes...Or should I not even sell them since I have to pay a fee to sell and then I could just keep them in there until when/if I needed them down the road?


Another side question, when I view my balances on TD Ameritrade's site I see my adjusted cost as about 6,800, market value 9,700, then Adjusted gain about 2,800 and 42%. Does that mean I have made 2,800 throughout all of them in the 3 years? Is that around average? Because to me it seems like quite a bit, I knew they were doing good but did not look at those exact numbers until today...

Any help is appreciated. Thanks!

(1) What happened before will happen again.

-- But why? What makes this unable to be approached with the following argument (if you flip a coin ten times and it's tails 9 out of 10 times, does this increase the odds of it being tails on the 11th trial?)

(2) People are emotional

Sure, but how many people really use technical analysis? It doesn't seem so widespread as it seems most of the big mutual funds don't employ it. Thus the emotions should not really play a huge factor?


I'm basically being the annoying guy and asking ""why why why"". I understand how fundamental analysis works even after asking ""why"" to the very bottom level. I am looking for a similar explanation for technical analysis.

16-08-14,4xmdod,Sientra to the Moon,"Move Over $MiSTaX. Not only does this stock have great potential to be at least a four-bagger, this company embodies everything this sub loves: Fake Tits. To be completely honest, this here is the bread and butter of my [DD](http://palmdesertplasticsurgery.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Picture-1.png).

Up until Sientra entered the game in 2012, the fake tits industry in the United States was a duopoly between Allergan and Mentor, a J&amp;J piece of shit subsidiary. Sientra joined the mix by getting FDA approval of silicone tits made by Silimed in 2012. The company opened public trading at $17.80 a share. In order to get ahead, Sientra took many of Mentor's employees, which led to Mentor filing a lawsuit of corporate raiding, anti-competive tactics, and all of the above. Mentor failed and the jury ruled in favor of Sientra.

Next, the Brazilian company that makes Sientra's fake tits got inspected by Germany's ""FDA"" in which they found impurities on the surface of Silimed implants. Even though this would cause no danger to the women getting new tits due to the sterilization process right before surgery, the European fucks decided to revoke Silimed's certification for their implants in Europe. As a result, Sientra voluntarily halted its sales in America. The stock plummeted down to $3 a share

This is where it gets weird and borderline has me believing in a conspiracy that Mentor is behind this activity. After Sientra resumed its operations in the United States under its new CEO, the factory in Brazil burned down. This shit cannot get more fucked up. J&amp;J man, they're like the Hillary Clinton of the medical industry.

So fast forward to this past week when Sientra released their second quarter. They said fuck making their product in Brazil, and now teamed up with Lubrizol, a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary, to have the tits made in Ohio. Since the Brazil factory burned down, Sientra has been relying fully on it inventory to sell its fake tits. They expect to get back to selling at full capacity before the shitshow occurred by the first quarter of 2017. Right now, the stock trades at $8.24 a share. It's 52-week high is 25.00. This stock is a bargain right now and its short interest has been decreasing. These fuckers know they're gonna lose money big league.

Also, Sientra's CEO, Jeffrey Nugent, has a tremendous record and can hopefully lead Sientra to a buyout. Plus, he's a patriot that just loves a nice rack.

&gt;Nugent’s experience includes serving as the CEO and Worldwide President of Neutrogena, where he led the acquisition by Johnson &amp; Johnson. Neutrogena is regarded as one of the most successful acquisitions in J&amp;J history.

Unfortunately, it never happened, but I'm still really interested in doing something like this. I am personally willing to put in some money and incorporate an LLC and start a Kickstarter so that we can pool some funds together and get majority ownership in a nano-cap company (per WSB's choice, of course!) for laughs. We will attend shareholder meetings, pay lawyers to push for a liquidation through Chapter 7 and return the money to everyone via Paypal as gains for you all.

If this can get off the ground, I'm willing to do weekly video updates on how the LLC and its investments are doing. I live in Boston, and if anyone in the Boston-area is down to meeting so that we can formulate a plan and make this legit, I'm down. I really want to do this, and I'm willing to devote the time.

In fact, if enough people think this is a good idea, I will incorporate an LLC in the coming weeks at my own expense for future purposes should someone else wish to take on the mantle.

However, I will warn everyone that we will need at $10,000,000 to even try something like this though... I doubt most people are willing to put down more than $500 or $1,000.",148

| Symbol | P/E | PEG | Payout Ratio | Yield | YoY Dividend Growth |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| AFL | 11.95 | 1.29 | 19.99% | 2.26% | ~6% |
| GILD | 7.02 | 88.15 | 15.10% | 2.36% | not enough history |
| SWKS | 13.39 | 0.79 | 20.27% | 1.66% | not enough history |
| WFC | 11.82 | 1.53 | 37.15% | 3.17% | ~9% and up |

I'm not about to pretend any of these companies are *perfect*, but AFL and SWKS look like especially good picks. They all seem to me like they can weather a bit of a storm with their low payout ratios, although WFC has cut its dividend in the somewhat recent past. Also what's with GILD's PEG?

I find this concept interesting and want some input on it's viability. Essentially the strategy would involve paying a lump sum of cash for less than the total structured settlement or annuities value and then collecting the payments over time. If you were to do this with several different structured settlements it seems like it could be a lucrative source of income. 

The most obvious risk's would be the liquidity of the investment, the insurance companies reliability, and of course inflation. However I'm sure these are all factors which get factored into the offering price. Are there other, less apparent risks to this strategy? What are some of the metrics by which you grade whether this is a sound investment or not?

Also for those of you who have made this type of investment how do you go about finding potential sellers?

16-08-15,4xt5lp,Recession Investing (paradox?),"In a recession scenario there seem to be 2 current elements that are countering each other in my mind.

Recessions usually (in the downward phase) attract money into government bonds and fixed income securities and away from risky equities. At the same time however interest rates are at record lows and some government bonds are actually generating negative yields pushing investors away. 

Therefore the question is, in the event of a recession would money likely still flow into government bonds to escape the risk, even with such low or negative yields or would it perhaps go into commodities or elsewhere?",5

16-08-15,4xtj7p,"Most Unpopular S&amp;P 500 stocks","Hi,

Many Value Investing books that I've read, recommend stocks that are not on the hype and I observed that stocks that are on the hype tend to have greater average volume transacted relative to their market cap. Also, stocks that are usually longed will have fewer transactions that those that are shorted frequently.

So one way to compute ""Hype"" of a stock is to compute the percent of shares that are transacted daily on average on it and see how it compares to the median value of all the other stocks.

I've wrote a script to do that using data from Yahoo Finance and you can find the resulting list on [unpopularstocks.com](http://www.unpopularstocks.com)

Please let me know your thoughts, if it helps you or at least if it makes any sense to you.

Why are share floats in the UK ridiculously large when compared to say Canada/USA. Seems like a factor of 10.

16-08-16,4xwp15,Earnings Run-up Strategy [Day 2],"I never did a day 1 as I’ve been all over the place. The purpose of this post is just to document me playing the earnings run-up with simply buying and selling. No Options, No day trades.

**Prestory**

I was pretty much fed up with getting burned on earnings reports. It was way too much of a gamble with even companies tanking after beating top and bottom line. There were little patterns or correlations. Like others have noticed, there are a great deal of stocks that “runup” right before earnings, some an hour before, some a day before, some a week in advance. So my goal is to exploit this. I tried it first with First Solar and even though it swung -12% after its ER I was able to come out 5% and not be a bagholder.

**Goal**

* Beat the market (obviously)
* 3% daily average gain

**Method**

I won’t go into too much detail with my stock picking method but they are all weighted on a scoring system I made, and from that system I pick the highest ones, buying them all 36 - 48hr in advance. I also take into account whether they're pre or post market hour ERs. When earnings day come around all stocks are sold at the peak of the run up expect those that I explicitly tagged, those are held past earnings. If I expect a volatile swing of 5%+ I sell off half right before earnings.

**Fridays run up**

I was already down last week but acting on this method on Thursday took me from -6% to -3.62% but this was my total portfolio not just this method. I didnt document well hence the reason why I never made a post but ill be conservative and say the method netted me 2%

**Today’s run up and sells**

Sticker | run up % | Holding/held post earnings | AH | total profit
---------|----------|-----------|--------|----------
FN | 6% | Yes (no half/half)| 4%+ | 10%+ 
SID | 4% | No | -5% | &lt;1% bought in at a high!
SYY | 2.8% | No | -0.2% | 2.8%

considering their weights my estimated percent so far for today is 4% not taking into account FN AH.

**Tuesday run up or Earnings**

* PlKl
* TJX

**Remaining Current run up Holdings (in no order)**

* TGT
* WMT
* DE
* FL (Holding past ER half/half)
* CSIQ (Holding Past ER half/half)
* JASO (Holding past ER half/half)
* TECH
* CSCO
* AMAT
* PLAB

**Conclusion**

I havent done this long enough to see if this is viable but It looks promising. Friday was 2%, today was 4% and increasing. I need to see how this does on a down day for the market. A daily 3% gain doesn't seem like much when you see some biotechs going 10%+ after earnings or seeing a 3x etf open at 5%+, but if you get a constant 3% daily gain it compounds and will net you almost 16% a week. Meaning that an investment of $5000 will make you $800 a week if everything is weighted correctly. Going forward I hope to record data and transactions better (RH sucks), and improve on my scoring system. Also all of this is done manually but I hope to automate it someday hopefully by Q1 2017 earnings. I dont know anything much about CS but I'm a physics major and use python a lot I just dont know where to start.

They make exo skeletons, if you don't know what that is, if you've watched the movie ""edge of tomorrow"" with tom cruise, or played one of the latest call of duty games, that's an exoskeleton, and these guys are making it a reality.

The first goal is to introduce this technology to healthcare industry for paralyzed people, second goal is military. These guys have the ""only"" FDA approved exoskeleton for stroke patients, and they have over 200 patent rights around the world, and about 150 in US. 

As for the potential;

""Last October EKSO announced that they were selected by Boston Dynamics, now part of Google, to continue developing technologies for Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA’s) Warrior Web Task A project.

Lockheed Martin is the exclusive contractor of the US military, EKSO is working with them in an attempt to provide exoskeletons for military purposes. Many EKSO investors are overlooking this opportunity. The military market could be the secondary market that not only raises awareness of EKSO’s bionic skeleton, but also advances the function of the technology.""
(microcapdaily.com)

As you can see, their potential is immense, its an untapped $94 billion industry. However, if you look at the price chart you can see a recent huge fall from 6$ to 4$. They announced an uplisting recently from OTC to NASDAQ and issued 3.75 million shares at $4 dollars to raise capital, that's the reason of the fall, that's the opportunity I see.

Their financials are a mess in the last quarter, but that is because they are aggressively funding their sales with almost over 5 million dollars, expected q3 results are much more positive than this quarter, because they are already selling their exoskeletons to hospitals and patients.

Its inevitable that this company will get back to where it was in a quick manner, since there is no need to raise capital in the upcoming months, until or(most likely and) after the earnings this shit will go up.


**WSB sum: Uplisted company to nasdaq had a price fall from 6$ to 4$ by raising capital, with the potential and expected positive results in q3 the jump back will be soon, probably in the range of %30-%50.**",0

16-08-16,4xzh6m,CST buyout this week/next very likely,"Im expecting a pps of $50-$55 (current share price is ~47) which would reflect a standard industry ebitda multiple after realizing some of the ebitda margin expansion that a better management team could provide through better supply distribution and strategic initiatives (like warm fresh food, etc). Be aware that if a deal doesn't happen, this will probably fall back to around $35-38 per share. 

**BACKGROUND**: CST Brands owns convenience stores across the US that have failed to realize the revenue growth and ebitda margins of its competitors like 7/11 and circle K. The company was spun off from Valero energy in 2013 and hasn't performed well in the public market with the exception of company sale speculation driven stock appreciation. CST has been rumored to be for sale for about 3 months now (approximately the length of a standard auction sale process) and today the wsj is reporting that a deal could be reported as early as this week with Couche Tard (circle k's parent) being the leading bidder. Couche Tard is a Canadian company which would benefit from the stronger dollar and has a strong brand which would also help it realize synergies in the deal. 

Another driving force in the deal is the activist shareholder base which also has board representation (engine Capital and jcp investment management).

A family member came to me to ask for my opinion on a company called ""Copy Profit Share"". I have not heard of them before, but when I looked into them, it seems that they are a multi-level marketing forex/binary mentorship company. They have a two fold structure where you recruit others to join, and make money off them joining, as well as getting mentorship training from a teacher, and trade your own forex or binary account.

I am pretty skeptical about these kinds of things, but I definitely could be wrong. Just wondering if anyone has heard of them, and/or joined something similar. Do you think it is a good starting point for someone who knows nothing about forex, trading, etc. Thanks",1

another one

https://www.interactivebrokers.com/images/2015/webinarnotes/wn_twsintermediate_008.png

There are different exchanges on the lists above like ARCA, BATS, NSDQ, NYSE, and so on. I've read that Interactive Brokers doesn't (or can't?) send your orders to the primary exchanges (Nasdaq and NYSE are primary exchanges, right?) if your buy order is an ""odd lot"" order. That's okay, I got it, there are more than one exchange where you can buy or sell a stock.

Let's look at IBM.
http://www.investing.com/equities/ibm

Its historical data.
http://www.investing.com/equities/ibm-historical-data

1-) IBM is traded on NYSE only, but something called NSDQ is also on the Level II order book. Is it Nasdaq? If I buy 500 IBM shares through BATS or NYSE, can I sell these shares through another exchange like DRCTEDGE or do I have to use the same exchange?

2-) As you can see, investing.com shows that IBM was traded between 163.46 and 161.52 on the 12th of the August and had 2.54 million shares volume (~400 million dollars is really huge!), does this data include every exchange in the US where IBM is traded or only primary exchange (NYSE)?

16-08-16,4xxib3,Saudi oil gainz (rant),"Something smells fishy and I don't know if crude oil should be going up or going down. My bet is that it will go down, HARD.

So the Saudi oil chief says something about [stabilizing the market](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-oil-algeria-idUSKCN10M1MQ) and suddenly oil rises 10% to a five week high. The US government had begun [increasing their oil surplus for the past 4 weeks](https://www.tradingfloor.com/calendar/us-eia-weekly-petroleum-status-report) so of course the price of oil should be going up... The Saudi oil king reduces production, the US Gov't reacts by quickly buying more oil... It sounds good, right? All is kosher.

But let's not forget [THIS FUCK](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/03/business/energy-environment/opec-meeting-oil-production-saudi-arabia.html?_r=0) is the one everyone is banking on. We're looking at Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih like he's fucking [Ned Stark](https://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/71011132.jpg) about to save the world when in reality he's just fucking oil Hitler. Reuters is full of shit.

Reuters can be quoted, ""Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s largest oil producer, pledged during the last OPEC meeting in June that the kingdom would not flood the market with oil."" 

When in reality the June 2nd article said, ""While other OPEC members have been urging the freezing or lowering of oil production, Mr. Falih is pushing to keep it high and plow the money into other industries that might prove profitable for Saudi Arabia."" Mr. Falih can be quoted saying, ""Certainly we will not go with certain price targets.” And the whole point of the article was, ""Don’t expect us to influence the price of crude oil by adjusting supplies.""

But nevertheless Reuters quoted Khalid al-Falih saying, ""We are going to have a ministerial meeting of IEF in Algeria next month, and there is an opportunity for OPEC and major exporting non-OPEC ministers to meet and discuss the market situation, including any possible action that may be required to stabilize the market."" 

Great. We will wait until next month for them to talk it over. But in the meantime lets rejoice in our FUCKING MASSIVE OIL GAINZ. 

Seriously, what the fuck. Al-Falih is full of shit. Putin is full of shit. I'd fucking bet Putin is [working with al-Falih](http://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Oil-Sustains-Rally-As-Russia-Returns-To-OPEC-Negotiating-Table.html) to set up the market. They're propping up the US market. S&amp;P 500 and DOW are at all-time highs rallying behind oil. It's fucking awesome right? But let's face reality, the Saudi oil king [holds all the fucking cards](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/russia-sparks-oil-rally-but-saudis-still-hold-the-cards-2016-08-15). 

Will Khalid al-Falih reduce the production of oil, stabilize the market, bring massive gainz to the world, at a cost to Saudi Arabia? I doubt it. Maybe there are world regulations that this guy must surrender to, but the article [Reuters was quoting](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/03/business/energy-environment/opec-meeting-oil-production-saudi-arabia.html?_r=0) didn't make Khalid al-Falih sound like a reasonable guy.

But talk of [oil stabilization](http://english.alarabiya.net/en/business/energy/2016/04/09/Oil-prices-jump-on-signs-of-us-cutbacks-Doha-hopes.html) isn't new. It happened early April. And the market favored it. But unlike this time, we aren't in a bull market. Shit was in free fall before this ""market stabilization"" occurred, and will return to free fall once everyone wakes up to [THE FUCKING OIL GLUT](http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/stunning-map-oil-supply-glut-leads-to-massive-tanker-traffic-jam-would-stretch-for-25-miles_04142016) we have. A correction may happen soon &amp; DWTI could see 30% gainz. Look, even [Morgan Stanley](http://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/Morgan-Stanley-The-Oil-Rally-Might-End-On-Wednesday.html) says so.

[Butt](http://ih1.redbubble.net/image.24695464.0125/flat,800x800,070,f.u1.jpg), maybe I'm just a [fagg0t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) who doesn't know the fuck he's talking about.

Europe: Between ultra nationalist rising, borders being thrown up, people forget Western Europe is a bigger economy than the U.S. All without deposit insurance, a centralized fiscal authority and a banking system that is levered to the hilt at around 20-30x (the worst the US got to was 22 during the GFC and it is now at 11-13x). This has been a slow moving crisis for 2-3 years. The end game will still have to be massive recapitalization of the banking system or allow a chain reaction banking system collapse. Brexit was just the start, Frexit is next, Italyexit is coming. Interbank systems locking up is only a matter of time.

China: Largest build up of debt in the world. Ghost buildings and misallocation of capital. China's banking system grew from 3 trillion to 34 trillion from 2006 to 2016. To compare, the US' banking system is 15 trillion, with an economy 1.5x as large. There will have to be massive banking recapitalization as a result. Just how low will the RMB go when they need to cover 2-3 trillion of losses in the banking system or allow widespread defaults to happen? There goes the 3 trillion fx reserves. What happens to other EM? Welcome to Asian Financial Crisis 2.0.

Japan: Demographic time bomb. Insolvent government being propped up by printing money to buy JGBs. negative yield, banks that are going bust because of negative yields. Age 65 over increasing from 35% to 45% over the next 10 years. These old people are drawing down their savings, there is no buyer of assets or new depositors in the system anymore. The whole thing is a house of cards, which could explode any second either with a hyperinflationary collapse or a deflationary collapse cause by a banking system collapse. You are one supply shock in oil away from Zimbabwe in Japan, when monetization will have to meet with convexity. 

There is a massive level of structural issues around the world, none of which is being fixed, and the can is just being kicked down the road. The US is looking better than the rest, but we are talking about extinction level risk for the largest (EU), 3rd largest (China and 4th largest (japan) economy simultaneously. The fact people on here are not scared shit out of their mind is what is baffling to me. I have worked in buyside finance (both HF and PE) for 6 years and frankly I and other people in the industry lose sleep over all of this constantly. ",0

16-08-16,4y0dd7,Why Apple (AAPL) Should Double its Dividend NOW,"Apple's growth phase is behind it. It's time to ramp up its capital return program, and not through further BS stock buybacks to artificially boost EPS. 

Create some real shareholder value by lining their pockets with cash! 2.1% is a measly dividend when you consider that Apple has over $230 billion in the bank and could literally DOUBLE its divvy to over 4% without feeling the pain. 

Its payout ratio is a laughable 26% right now, about half of what respectable mega-cap dividend stocks pay their investors.

My theory? Apple is in denial that its years of hypergrowth are in the rearview mirror, and it's keeping oodles of cash around ""just in case"" they need to invest super heavily in something. Ain't gonna happen.

Let me start by saying I'm a very amateur investor with simple index funds in Canada with not much background. Basically a George Forman grill - set it and forget it. 

This is probably something geared toward the scientific community and investors at the same time.

I'm just looking for a discussion to see what the general consensus is of the investing world is and if this is way too far fetched or feasible. 

So being part of Reddit, there have been allot of posts about space travel and space initiatives lately.

So the general idea of this company is basically in the title. Asteroid Mining. The company is Planetary Resources inc. And Has been working for a few years now in developing a program to mine asteroids. It's been recently backed by big investors like Google, zuckerberg &amp;amp;amp; the government of Luxembourg. Spending millions to get it off the ground. 

It has met its criticisms by Forbes and Bloomberg articles, but as a long term, with the tech boom that's been happening with the spaceX tests, Juno satellite that entered orbit around Jupitor. Are we almost at that point where this could be a serious reality?

Again basic investor, but this companies stock value is 0.03 cents per stock is a penny stock right now. (Could be looking at this wrong). This isn't something that's going to boom right away but their plans go to about 2030

Even the smallest investment here could turn into millions in 10-20 years. 


Does anyone see this as a viable investment? Or have any kind of insight into this?

Links below for related articles. 

Edit1 :Stock code: PRRY. Wrong stock code. 
Company is private at the moment with no IPO. 

Edit 2: just want to note that the first step in these plans is to get water from the asteroids first. It's a long process but the actual mining comes later. Links have videos to the process.

I did the math and it's not working out,  so I was hoping someone could please explain the benefits/ or costs to me. Thanks in advance 

My math: 
You know stock A is going to double in the future,  so you buy 1000 shares at 2.00/ share (2000). It takes a dip to 1.50. Sell 300 stocks, get 450$, take a 150 loss. Use those 450 to buy 300 shares and end with 1000 total shares.  

Stock goes up to $4. 
(4-1.5)*300 = 750
(4-2)*700=1400
Total earnings =(750+1400)-150 = 2000

Which is the same as if I hadn't done anything:
(4-2)*1000= 2000

Is this correct? I hope I'm being clear. Thanks in advance!",0

As I see it, REITs are generally easier to deal with than physical real estate, more liquid, pay dividend and allows you to invest any amount.


However, index fund ALREADY holds REIT companies, right?


So how are REITs better? Is there any logical argument for diversifying in them?


Why not simply drop all the sums you save for investing (other than your own business / startup) into a three fund index portfolio with stock/bond allocation depending on your risk tolerance?


Why even bother with REITs, real estate or anything of that sort unless you have some insider knowledge, or some advantage that the general public and market does not have?

Anyways, I would like to invest during the next major stock market correction. Perhaps in the next year China will crash again, or some other European country, or perhaps some major sector. The things that usually happen once or twice a year that affect the whole stock market.

During that time period I would like to invest in those large companies, since I missed the train for the current rally. But I am uncertain how I should go about it.

The choices I can think of is:

 * Buying a large quantity of bonds the amount I want to purchase the stock. I'm not sure which bonds though. I am looking at TLT.

 * Selling long term cash secured puts. But this choice doesn't really give much money, or give it much room to grow. 

 * Investing normally, trying to amass as much wealth as possible during the rally and just eat the dip and switch over during it. Perhaps some stocks wont be as affected as others. But this is pretty much the same strategy as investing bonds gives. Except bonds will increase during the correction.


I want to try and think of this as a long term investor would. I'm too much of a trader at heart. The only exposure I have had to a long term investor is ""buy high and hold"".",0

16-08-17,4y3bye,Discussion Regarding Recent IPO $HOME,"I posted this in a smaller subreddit but would like to get your thoughts on $HOME.

At Home is a home decor retailer based in Texas. For the past 7 quarters they have been increasing their income and should become profitable soon.  They are expanding and expect to build another 10 to 15 stores in the next year and they seem to have things together.  Currently their indirect competitors are stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond or Big Lots but currently ""At Home"" has better prices and more SKU's devoted to decoration.  However currently they have no way to order online and have ZERO plans in the works.  

I'm still really new to this but the stores operate on a profitable foundation and with future growth this should result in positive cash flow.  Am I missing something to think that at around $15 dollars it could be a profitable long term play if they continue to expand rapidly? Or would waiting till the lock-out period is over be a wise choice? Thanks!

Most of (90%) of $6,000 is in tech. Google, facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Activision Blizzard, Nvidia etc. 

The recent idea was pitched to me by a friend that Water is going to be the next big industry that comes out of nowhere. Due to overpopulation and a decreasing water supply, water supply companies and salinization companies will be able to create bigger profits.

Over the last 3-5 trading days these utility companies have taken massive losses. I have three thoughts as to why this could be happening 

1) Earnings for most of these utilities just came out and investors realized that while the utility co's are a safe bet they are also way over-bought. 

2) The market is improving and it's now time to pull the cash out of the safe investment and put it into something with a little more ROI potential. 

3) Investors are becoming weary of the market testing new highs and are solidifying the large gains over the past 12 months and are sitting on cash until they feel comfortable investing again.

I am leaning towards option 1 or 2 or a combination of the two. I am holding out hope because the overall market, DJI/S&amp;P/NASDQ were improving while the utilities were going down. This tells me that the money was re-invested...

16-08-17,4y3jn1,Any opinions on GLD or IAU,"I'm interested in a good stock play right now or the next week or so.  Thinking about the gold ETFs (GLD or IAU).

Backgroud: The last time I invested was in 2008... so I'm nervous to get back in.  But I'm looking to make a short term move, but I'd be interested in a long term play too if it presented itself.  Right now I'm worried about a bearish turn on the market overall.  I'm familiar with advanced options strategies, but have never actually done anything except an uncovered call.

Question: I'm looking into gold ETFs.  My beginner level research on gold, as expressed via the GLD stock, seems to indicate resistance/support around $127.50 and $138 respectively.  Right now it is $128.47.  As a person who's lost way too much money than I'd like to reveal, does this sound like a decent short term play?  I'm interested in stock or options.

TL;DR: I lost a lot of money in the past on options.  Is GLD/IAU (Gold ETFs) a decent play right now?  (And are my support/resistance even close to correct?)",1

16-08-16,4xypig,Need advice/help on how to retrieve stocks that were invested in 1998,"To begin I am 19 and technically an ""adult"" to society. I was at lunch with my aunt the other day and she asked if I ever cashed out on the shares of Walt Disney my aunt got me in 1998, 1 year after I was born. My dad allegedly was a co signer (I think thats what my aunt said) but the stocks are in my name. She asked me if I talked to my dad about it to see if he still had the paper work. 

Well I did talk to my dad, but he and I don't exactly get along so he said he'd check (meaning he doesn't give 2 f**** and went back to whatever) this was 1 year ago when I turned 18 because my aunt was excited for me as I guess the amount of shares she got me is now A LOT of money. 

I asked my mom if she's seen the physical record of the stock purchased and she hasn't (I know she checked) so my aunt is going to see if she has a copy.

 -If she doesn't have a copy, what can I do so I can cash out on the shares as I desperately need the cash? Can I find it online? 

-also since I am not a minor anymore and the stock was titled to me but my dad signed at the time, am I able to get them myself without him knowing? If I have to include him, I KNOW he will attempt to take at least 50% since he ""co-signed and monitored it for me"" when I was 1 years old and know he didn't do anything with them as he pays 0 attention to the market or anything economic related; his job doesn't relate to that market at all.

**Today’s run up and sells**

Sticker | Today's run up % | Holding/held post earnings | AH | My total profit
---------|----------|-----------|--------|----------
TJX | -5.8% | No| +0.1% | -3.1%
JASO | 0.65% | No | +1.54% | 2.44%
TGT | -0.07% | No | -0.11% | -0.38%
PLKI | 2.7% | No | -1.68% | 2.05%
TOTAL | n/a | n/a | n/a | +0.22%

(The total takes into affect my own weights of the positions. I tried to play the retail shit with target and held a large position)

After taking into account yesterdays AH and todays Pre Market for 8/12, 8/15, and 8/16 Im up 2%, 5%, and 0.22% respectively. I'm not sure how much that is compounded as my principal balance inst consistent but If it was that would be 7.34% over 3 days.

**Wednesday run up or Earnings**

( I think I might play all of these half/half depending on what happens during market hours.)

* CSCO
* IMMU
* CSIQ

**Remaining Current run up Holdings (in no order)**

* FL (Holding past ER half/half)
* CSCO
* AMAT
* PLAB
* SWHC
* HPQ
* TOL
* HIBB (largest holding!)

**Conclusion**

Although I was nowhere 3% I did beat the market. It seems like I would have came out a lot higher if I didnt buy into the retail hype. It also seems like I also would have had better gains had I bought them 48 - 72 hours earlier. The problem however with moving further and further back is that you cant see if there will ever actually be a run up and not a flat line or run down. You also increase the time interval at which something can go wrong and drop the stock. As expected there is no hard range and buy-ins vary stock to stock.

16-08-17,4y7fxq,FLKS DD,"**Flex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:FLKS)** is a biotechnology company based in Boston, Massachusetts that is currently developing 3 drugs and a consumer product, all of which utilize extremely similar technology. They are researching single channel TRP activators as treatment for muscle cramps and spasms caused by ALS, NLC (nocturnal leg cramps), MS. They also have recently launched their consumer brand, HOTSHOT, a cramp treatment for athletes, which works the same way as the 3 drugs, by activating TRP ion channels $FLKS market cap is around $200M.


**good stuff thus far**


-Experienced leadership including former CEO of Apple and Pepsi as well as SVP of Starbucks. 


-[Product has shown efficacy and safety in an independent study done by Penn state researchers](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160406005152/en/Flex-Pharma-Collaborator-Penn-State-Presents-Positive)


-[Huge amounts of insider buys](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/flks/insider-trades)


**How it Works**


The single molecule TRP agonist works to relieve muscle cramps by activating TRPA1 and TRPV1 ion channels through the mouth which then stops the nerves from causing cramps. These TRP ion channels are the same ones responsible for cold and hot sensations which is what gives the consumer product HOTSHOT it's name. 


**catalysts and money**

Currently have $75 million in free cash and investments which should last them until the middle of 2018


Made approx $112,000 in first quarter (not sure on this because they said their ecommerce held 30 days worth of payments so it could be more)


The MS and ALS trials are entering phase 2 and the NLC trial has completed enrollment ahead of schedule. 


NLC was formerly treated by quinine, which is now banned after it was found by the FDA to be dangerous and possibly deadly. There are currently an estimated 5 million cases of NLC in seniors that can be treated by Flex's single molecule TRP agonist.


Release of phase 2 top-line data for MS and ALS trials is expected at the end of this year.


Given the other drugs pass phase II and phase III trials, the real moonshot will come if their consumer product goes mainstream which is a very real possibility given the positive feedback they have received from the endurance athletes currently using it. From the couple months of sales they already have on their consumer product, they have seen many reorders of high quantity and are supplying numerous pro sports teams including those in NFL and MLB. HOTSHOT is being marketed using a ""cult brand"" strategy, which aims for mainstream acceptance by getting a small, target group of people to be repeat customers and fans of the brand and eventually spreading to the public eye. The target group in this case being endurance athletes. [(see here for wiki article on cult brands)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_brand). Successful examples of cult brands include Apple, lululemon, red bull, and uber.


If you want to buy in after taking a look into this stock, keep in mind most would consider this stock to be long term (multi year). I understand that most of you consider anything longer than 1 month to be an eternity, and if you want to hop in later closer to liftoff, then It would not be the worst idea, but keep in mind that the price could fluctuate greatly in the coming months, especially given the company's ahead of schedule enrollment and alert of updates coming in the near future.

4. Look for stocks fitting said criteria and then pick ones that that only went up a few percent on earnings after/pre-market.
5. Set a limit order for 5%-10% under what the close price was.
6. Sell within 7 days.

I've seen this happen to quite a few good stocks right after their earnings the next day/after open, so the pickup near the bottom usually nets at least 3% within a few days.

16-08-17,4y7t49,A complete beginner here. Want to ask a question about by first investment worth $735,"Hi, I wanted to invest in stocks, but being someone residing outside the US, I thought it would be difficult to open account, do all the registration stuff etc, plus I do not know how to buy stocks and unaware of all the details involved. 

I know an expert person in the US. I have him $735, he says he will buy QTNT shares with this amount, and I can ask for the money back any time at the price of the stock at that day (the day I want my money back).

Does it sound good? 
So if the current stock price of QTNT is $6.07, around 121 shares of QTNT can be acquired today.

So let's say today, the price of QTNT is $6.07, tomorrow, it goes to $10. Can I ask him to give me 121*10= $1210? 

Edit: As far as the trust on the person who bought the stocks for me, I have zero concerns. I know him for years and he will transfer me money the day I ask him. The only concern is now QTNT, as replies here have alarmed me. This guy has been trading in the market for years, and says while there are probabilities of losses, QTNT can give as much as 300% profit. I read analyst firms like Jefferies and UBS have given a buy rating with a price traget of around $20 for QTNT in Jne, July as well. What do you guys think?

So i am self employed. I have several plans. One is to own ten properties (I currently own 3 with mortgages (not massive ones), I am hoping in the next 10 years to hit my target.

However, I am looking to ""spread my risk"" and I've always fantasized owning physical gold bullion. I've also heard that its not a bad thing to invest in.

So I made a plan for the next 12 years to purchase 3x 1 oz gold bullion and by the 12th year I would have 1kilogram.

My plan is to sit on that gold for a further 10 years. Ideally not invest in any more gold (MAYBE if my calculations I'll buy a 1kg gold bar just for the thrill of it on top. But if not I guess this is a 20 year plan. 

Is this a wise investment? Like my properties (that god willing I never wish to sell), I just want to have it there so its worth a lot, in case of a rainy day in a safe in my basement. Have I just got Scrooge McDuck syndrome?

16-08-16,4y2951,Renault SA - Opinions?,"Hi all. Running a few screens this evening and Renault popped up in one of them that focuses on large-cap companies with price-to-book ratios below 0.85. I usually avoid automakers for long-term investments but this is a screen I use to pick out shorter term (1-3 year) profit opportunities.

Anyway, with 0.8 price-to-book, 7.1 P/E, very little debt (0.2 debt-to-equity) both compared to others in the sector and in absolute terms, a solid dividend yield (3.1%) and some hefty dividend rises over the last couple of years (+expectation of similar over the next couple), this looks like a decent opportunity to me.

The whole auto-sector is a little beat down at the moment but even if Renault reached the current average P/B (1.05ish) for the sector within three years, you'd still be talking a 31% uplift on the current price (+ dividends in the meantime).

Anyone else considered Renault or have any thoughts on them as an opportunity?",2

16-08-17,4y5zd6,The Case For Gold,"http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2003/0217/128.html

Good article from 2003 by Jim Grant. 

""This is the Bet She’an hoard, 7½ pounds of gold discovered in 1998 under the floor of an ancient residence in the Jordan Valley in northern Israel. It was buried around A.D. 680, probably to avoid confiscation, Israeli archeologists say.

If he weren’t so very dead, the unnamed owner of this treasure would be desolated, and his heirs would be inconsolable. For 13 centuries the coins in the pot earned no interest. What is the foregone interest on 7½ pounds of gold uninvested since the time of the fifth Umayyad caliph, Abd al-Malik?

Say the gold price in A.D. 680 was $350, or its equivalent. Say the value of that gold, $38,300, was invested at 3%, compounded continuously from that time to this. Then the foregone interest income would be no less than $6.4 sextillion.
income on this uninvested collection is beyond calculating.

Albert Einstein is said to have called compound interest the eighth wonder of the world. But it must be number one in the power to tantalize. If Adam and Eve had opened even a small savings account in the Bank of Eden, and if they and their descendants had conscientiously not made a withdrawal, then the human race could have long ago put its feet up and lived on the interest.

Of course, compounding is not continuous because history is discontinuous. People die, banks fail and nation states rise and fall. Money is confiscated or debased. There likely is a very good reason that 751 gold coins were buried instead of being lent out at interest. The owner traded an income stream in the bush for gold in the hand.

The paradox of gold is that it can be the finest speculation and the poorest investment. Though indestructible and lovely to behold, the barbarous relic earns no interest. And–what is much, much worse–it earns no interest on interest.

Gold was the right thing to bury in A.D. 680 and the wrong thing not to dig up and invest in Microsoft at a split-adjusted price of 18 cents a share in March 1986 A.D. (Today, 17 years later, the price is $51, a 283 bagger, as Peter Lynch might say.) Knowing when danger is advancing and receding is the rarest insight in investing, and it helps to explain the paucity of sextillion-dollar fortunes in The Forbes 400 list.""",1

Did this for oil today, market expected a -0.5 to +0.5 million build of crude and a +2 million gasoline build. Essentially flat expectations, but bear on the gas.

What happens? -2.5 million oil and -2.7 million gasoline. I go all in UWTI and I'm up a measly 1.8% today. It even FELL immediately after the report came out.

I'm not even messing with natural gas tomorrow. I lost my ass last week with the good storage report and the subsequent price drop. Makes no sense to me, sometimes.

Three funds I was looking at 

MPA
MUB
FPXTX

the yield on MUB AND FPXTX are so low. ~1%. 
MPA is a respectable 4.5% but comes along with a high expense ratio. I understand they're tax free but what is the attractions with these investments with a yield so low? 

4.5% is about what I expected for all of these funds. How is 1% a good recommendation for passive income? ",7

16-08-18,4ycb28,"Does no one else sense a building ""Gold Bubble?""","If you look at the price of gold, historically, it has had a greater climb since the early 2000 than any other largely traded commodity. And while there was a correction after it peaked at around 2000/ounce, it didn't correct nearly as far as it should have.

Additionally, for the fist time historically (or at least since Gold started it's massive climb) Gold has exceeded the price of Platinum and it has held for several years. That's not a normal pattern.

Here's my speculation - Currently, the price of Gold is primarily propped up by fear... Mostly fear of another dotcom, real-estate bubble or recession. That fear is starting to subside and people are regaining faith in the S&amp;P and housing market. Personally (completely speculative), I think Trump's campaign and the Fed uncertainty has been feeding into that fear and inadvertently propped up Gold from correcting. Once the political race dies down, we'll really start to see the move start.

When people realize their gold is only good for trading into dollars and it pays no dividends, and you can only buy shares/Funds after you sell your gold, it will begin to correct... BUT (more wild speculation), this shift will trigger a bit of a sell-off, gold will move too fast and far as people panic rid of it and to get into the S&amp;P, while the S&amp;P takes off from this shift. Trading will his a sense of Euphoria because, for probably over a year or more, everything will soar up!

Gold will start to plummets towards ~700-800 and the S&amp;P just keeps climbing to ~2,500. 

Just my thoughts.

Shorting = borrowing the stock or derivative, selling it, waiting for it to go down, buying back and giving it back.  My questions are:  If XOM and / or other oil company stocks start going on an aquisition spree, isn't it like trading with themselves (buying distressed assets to prop up the price of oil?)  it is extremely easy borrow XOM stock (so there would be no problem with naked shorting)?  Could there theoritically be net short the same number of shares outstanding?  Is divestment enough to cause oil company insiders to trade with themselves (isn't this a loosing strategy)?  When you look at Form 4 selling by insiders, isn't it simply a good idea to short oil company stocks right now (in order to sell before they do)?  Thanks for your replies.

16-08-18,4yct5c,Against Continuous Compounding - Gold,"I like to see someone refute the following point by Jim Grant: 

&gt;""Albert Einstein is said to have called compound interest the eighth wonder of the world. But it must be number one in the power to tantalize. If Adam and Eve had opened even a small savings account in the Bank of Eden, and if they and their descendants had conscientiously not made a withdrawal, then the human race could have long ago put its feet up and lived on the interest.

&gt;Of course, compounding is not continuous because history is discontinuous. People die, banks fail and nation states rise and fall. Money is confiscated or debased. There likely is a very good reason that gold coins were being buried instead of being lent out at interest. The owner traded an income stream in the bush for gold in the hand.""

All it takes is one zero for the compounding to end. Reserve currencies and the center of global economic power shift. There is no guarantee U.S. is the future place for strong compounding just as power and reserve currencies for the past 400 years changed hands at least 5-6 times from Portugal to Spain to Dutch to the UK and to the US. If one looked 600 years ago, Europe was a provincial shithole just recovering from the dark ages and you would've put all of your money in China, not predicting it would've stagnated while Europe was about to engage in a renaissance in scientific revolution and exploration. 

The world is far more chaotic (both good and bad) than the simple compounding/equity indexing that people on here seems to follow religiously with extreme fervor.

16-08-18,4yar3e,Best online broker in Canada without high asset requirements?,"Hey guys. Looking to start some stock trading. I had originally wanted to set up an interactive brokers account, however they don't allow stock trading unless one has over 25k+ in liquid assets (which I currently do not have) anyone know of a decent broker that allows stock trading without such requirments?

Little about myself.

Used to do some stock trading about 8 years back under my parents account. Basic understanding of how stocks work. Do paper trading currently.

None of this money is needed, nor do I mind losing some until I begin to get back into the groove of things. I plan on allocating roughly 10% of my after tax income per month into my account. (Roughly 500 a month) so not a big account by any means and would prefer low fee's. I would eventually like to maybe do a little day trading.

Don't have much for liquid assets, but because I own a business I do have some hard assets. Basically my business is solid now so the cash I was spending on it is free now. Overhead is low and I work full time so fairly safe financially. The wife works as well but I am not using any of her income to invest.

Any tips/reviews are much appreciated! Thanks!",1

He says he will buy QTNT shares with this amount, and I can ask for the money back any time at the price of the stock at that day (the day I want my money back).

Does that make sense? 

So if the current stock price of QTNT is $6.07, around 121 shares of QTNT can be acquired today.

So let's say today, the price of QTNT is $6.07, tomorrow, it goes to $10. Can I ask him to give me 121*10= $1210?

Long term the company will take market share from bankrupt competitors.,Sports Authority and Sports Chalet bankruptcies had been expected to hit Dicks Sporting Goods in the short run as customers bought their sports equipment at liquidation prices. Even DKS had previously admitted sales would be down for the year.   In the long run however this was always going to benefit DKS as they won market share from old competitors - especially since they gained access to Sports Authorities 114 million customer files and brand.    Now that has changed.  DKS reported Q2 revenue and EPS of $1.97bn and 82 cents compared to $1.82bn and 77 cents last year.  Better yet the company significantly raised guidance for the current year from a mid point of $2.75 to $2.97.  Stocks have rallied and now trade on a PE of 20.51.  Well below the market but high for a retailer.  However most retailers arent growing at nearly 10% with long term catalysts for more growth -- supported by a rock solid balance sheet with almost no debt.,0

Warren Buffett is a huge proponent of indexing for normal people. He suggests low cost Vanguard S&amp;P500 index fund, VFINX.

&gt;My advice to the trustee could not be more simple: Put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&amp;P 500 index fund. (I suggest Vanguard's. (NASDAQMUTFUND:VFINX)) I believe the trust's long-term results from this policy will be superior to those attained by most investors -- whether pension funds, institutions, or individuals -- who employ high-fee managers.

The operational information on the company can all be found publically so I won't go into too much detail. However, the ops are performing phenomenally. Consistent debt restructuring along with reduction to SG&amp;A are just drops in the bucket of what will contribute in the long term. As volumes continue to climb and market share grows, revenue will obviously benefit. We're talking about a company with long term contracts with major players (Muni's ,large trucking organizations, large engine manufactures) and an expiring or exited contract is rare. By the way, has anyone seen NYMEX gas lately? It will give a leading indicator into what Q3 net rev may look like.

I (stupidly) bought two shares of $NVDA on Monday at $62.72 because I thought it would continue rising as it did on the Friday prior (this was the first stock I ever bought so I definitely learned from this mistake).

It now appears to be dropping more and more every day and my question is this: do you guys think I should hold it for the long term, OR should I sell it now, accept the ~$3 loss, and then buy in again when it drop to the mid $50s and then hold?

Is there a better way to play small blips in the SP500 when it comes to options? Basically I'd like to put more capital in play but with the same or less in commissions (optionshouse is a possibility but not that much of a difference I don't think).

I've looked at options for ES and SPX, but they don't seem to have the same volume and wider spreads. I also looked at higher priced SPY options too (fewer contracts but more capital in play), but they don't have the volume as you get deeper into the money.

So, I'm trying to understand how freeriding works. I usually hold a stock for no more than a day or two, and I've made decent money so far on a cash-only basis. I'm running up against freeriding issues though, and from what I can tell, the best way to get around the restriction is to have a margin account. 

My understanding is that freeriding is an issue when you sell a stock that hasn't had payment cleared yet. But if you have cash in the account to cover the purchase of the stock you're selling, it's ok. Does having a margin account work the same way? So basically, if your margin balance or your cash balance is enough to cover the purchase price of the stock, you can sell it before the three day time frame.

Does using the margin balance incur lending interest? Also, would it be equally effective to have, say $10,000 in a cash-only account and use no more than $5,000 for active trading, to ensure that there was always cash on hand to cover purchases?

Thanks as always for dealing with my noob questions.

16-08-18,4yfmdz,Is the end of the world coming?(robot overlords),"Yes you read that right. Starting with next year's class, Goldman will employ a new robot recruiting system for it's undergrad prospects. The whole purpose, according to them, is to remove the common traits and interests that the recruiter and the graduate might share, and instead hire people who are more ""consistently talented"" rather than just talking about the good old days of school and getting in.

While this move may be well intentioned in the sense that it gives equal opportunity to graduates from all schools, it does away with what we've come to recognize as an integral part of getting into finance: networking. The new process not only removes humans from the first interaction, it also introduces a new automated system to go through resumes which extracts personality traits from the resumes. According to the article:

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-23/goldman-sachs-scraps-on-campus-interviews-for-robo-recruiting

""The firm also will use a technology-based resume screening tool to try and identify traits such as grit, or life circumstances, that executives believe will better predict career success and longevity.""

The MBA hiring process remains the same, although Goldman said it plans to automate the whole process soon. So what do you guys think? Good news or the end of the world as we know it?

Medicure (mph). Best pharma product in its market for half the price. Taking over market share slowly but surely.  They also plan to buy the company that manufactures their drug (and other drugs). They are also getting a new drug which will complement their primary drug, and can be up sold to their current hospital accounts.  Word on the street is once they take over market majority they are going to hike the price and instantly increase their profit margin. Their operating costs are also very low and their revenue is almost all profit.

CGC: market share majority Canadian cannabis licensed producer.  Partnership with snoop Dogg says it all really.  They have the most real estate and can handle the largest production volume.  Once its recreationalised this company is going to either go up in value or be acquired by a big bucks tobacco/liquor company.  Con: operates at a loss due to ramping up facilities in anticipation of legalization 

APH aphria inc: Lowest product cost licensed marijuana producer .  already profitable on medicinal users alone.  Same logic as cgc, mainly in this one so all my money isn't on the one company.  Its also so I can see if i can micro trade swapping my money between the two based on news reports and do some monkey bars swing trading.

My only issue though is a lot of the time I tend to let gold mines slip through my fingers because my financial buddies tell me that the ""money just isn't there"". Yet, the only investment I've made substantial gains with is TSLA and AMD, the one that I watched pass me by because I listened to said claims. Both, not having the money there in the moment.

I honestly don't know how to word this question but I'm constantly talked out of companies because their financials don't match up with speculation 2-5 years down the road. Yet, I constantly watch these companies surge with inflation, over the very speculation I'm talked out of. With AMD, I knew for a long time they were the underdog compared to NVDA and Intel, and now watching their triumphant return is painful because I could've profited. Same deal with LB, limited brands. I watched their share price go from $20 to almost over $100 but because they lacked the earnings report at the time, I was told it wasn't anything to bat an eye at.

I seem to have a knack for predispositioning myself with companies that end up doing very well but because the finances and margins don't match my belief at the time, I ultimately believe those with the present day facts, despite them being wrong 6 months to a year down the line. Any advice would be appreciated.

16-08-19,4ykr5b,OptionsHouse really knows how to fill a guy,"I've been using OH this last week instead of my usual TDA for my short-term trading and noticed an interesting thing about their limit orders. 

One thing that always annoyed me about TDA is that limit orders never worked the way I expected them to.  If I put in a buy limit order for 4.00, what I mean is, ""get it for as cheap as you can *up to* 4.00"".  TDA has always taken this to mean ""ok, we got you a fill at 4.00 but we didn't check to see if it could have been cheaper - that's what you wanted, right?"", and I thought that was pretty lame.  In fact, I once fat-fingered a trade and that mistake cost me a few hundred bucks since their algorithm apparently doesn't check to see if the market price is less than your limit price.  In an ideal world, a limit order is like your bid offer on ebay, where the broker tries to bid as low as possible *up to* your limit - hence why it's a *limit* order not a ""fill at this fucking price even if a cheaper option is available"" order.  That's what the word ""limit"" means.  Christ.  Anyway, I've executed god knows how many trades with TDA and never once have I been filled at a better price than my limit. 

Meanwhile I've been using OH for a *five days* and probably 80% of my trades are filled better than my limit.  On buys, they're filling .01-.02 low and on sells they're often filling .01 high.  It's fucking amazing, and basically paying for my fees there (which are cheaper than TDA anyway).

Does anyone know why there is a difference in how limits are treated?  Is it just an algorithm difference or does OH have a different way of actually placing the trade on the market(s)?   I'm just curious how they are delivering this awesomeness to me. ",12

16-08-19,4yku3z,Netflix and Chill until Q3 is over,"On July 18th , Netflix ($NFLX) released its earnings report for Q2, and it is fair to say that it is quite disappointing. At its release after closing bell, its share price fell from $98.81 to $84.88 overnight. This is because investors lost trust in Netflix as a profitable stock. They cite Netflix’s un-grandfathering strategy and increasing competition as two main reasons behind Netflix’s inability to acquire new customers in Q2. 

**Why Netflix rallied**

From June 27th to July 18th, Netflix’s stocks rose by almost 16%, from $85.33 per share to $98.81 per share. This rally comes with the news of its partnership with Comcast, as well as the U.S. markets reaching record highs. It was a very bullish three weeks in the U.S. markets, and Netflix’s partnership announcement came at the right time. Netflix’s partnership is expected to reach 8 million Comcast X1 owners, a number which will increase significantly in Q3 and Q4. This news gave investors positive signs about Netflix’s potential growth, resulting in an increase in their stock price. However, I find this number to be uninformative for reasons I will state in a later section.

**A look into Q2 earnings report**

In Q2, Netflix grew by 1.7 million members and now possess over 83 million members. This is below its own forecast of 2.5 million new members, and last year’s Q2 net additions of 3.3 million. As for earnings, they ended Q2 with an operating income of $70 million and net income of $41 million, against a forecast of $47 million and $9 million respectively. This variance is largely due to lower-than-expected costs.

Even though they reported a higher-than-expected income, what concerns investors is Netflix’s failure to attract new customers. The gross additions were on target, but churn was unexpectedly higher in Q2.

Within the United States, its Q2 net additions were 0.16 million against a forecast of 0.50 million. Netflix expects to reach 60-90 million members domestically by 2020, and at their current pace, they would be lucky to reach 55 million. Domestically, Netflix currently stands at 47.13 million users. Assuming they continue at the same rate of 0.16 million per quarter, by the end of 2020, they will only have acquired 50.01 million customers.

As for global growth, net additions in Q2 were 1.5 million compared to its forecast of 2.0 million. Actual net additions fell significantly short of forecasts both domestically and internationally. Therefore, even a higher-than-expected earnings per share could not convince investors of its potential for growth.

**The Silver Lining**

As I mentioned in the first paragraph, the two main reasons behind investors’ bearish outlook is due to Netflix’s un-grandfathering strategy and increased competition. However, a closer analysis of the numbers will reveal that both of those reasons are unjustified.

According to Netflix’s letter to the investors, Netflix registered an unexpected uptick in churn rate in early April, which is coincident with the press coverage informing the public of Netflix’s plan to un-grandfather longer tenured members. However, the churn of members who were actually un-grandfathered was mild and matched Netflix’s own forecasts. This reveals that due to poor news reporting and miscommunication, many users thought that there would be an overall price increase.

As for the problem regarding increased competition, there is also a similar explanation. As Internet TV becomes increasingly popular, the number of subscription video on demand (SVOD) offerings also increases. In the U.S., there is Amazon Prime Video, CBS All Access, Seeso, Hulu, YouTube Red, and many others. This translates to more competition for Netflix. However, as Netflix points out in their letter to the investors, “increased competition would show up mostly in soft gross additions rather than churn”.  Netflix’s churn rate in Canada is also evidence of this. They experienced a similar uptick in churn in early April, but there was no recent increase in SVOD competition. Coincidentally, they were also in the process of un-grandfathering in Canada during that time.

Since Netflix’s gross additions were on target, if Netflix is correct about the reasoning behind its higher-than-expected churn, Q2’s poor results is a minor hiccup that should pass.

**Reasons to Invest**

According to CEO Reed Hastings in a Q2 earnings interview, he revealed that the current three-tier pricing strategy in the U.S. is working very well ($7.99 SD, $9.99 HD, and $11.99 UHD) with new members. With this new pricing system, it will generate significantly more revenue for Netflix to create more original content. As proven through Netflix Originals such as House of Cards and Orange is the New Black, Netflix originals have been highly successful. This year, Netflix Originals are nominated for 54 Primetime Emmys, which is the third-most total nominations of any domestic network, only behind FX and HBO.

Netflix Originals will be crucial in Netflix’s future because aside from their first-mover advantage, their original series will help with customer retention in the face of increasing competition. Even though Netflix claims that competition was not a cause in Q2’s poor results, increasing SVOD competition will certainly be significant in the near future.

Bear in mind the market for Internet TV is still huge. Netflix predicts that in the coming decades, there will be nearly 1 billion pay TV subscribers who will migrate to Internet TV. Netflix already has partnerships with over 40 multi-channel video programming distributors (MVPDs) around the world, which will increase their market penetration in areas with partnerships. However, there is one thing to be wary of in terms of partnerships in the United States: Netflix already has a large user base within the United States. This means that there will be many supposedly “new” customers who are already Netflix customers. For example, many owners of Comcast X1 are customers of Netflix. Therefore, the reported reach of 8 million Comcast X1 owners is a meaningless number as many of the 8 million are already Netflix users. Even Hastings admitted in the earnings interview that the Comcast partnership will only have a “modest” impact on customer growth.

As for Netflix’s goal of reaching 60-90 million customers in the U.S., I have no doubt that they will succeed. Their most difficult work lies ahead in international development as they face massive competition, regulations, pricing differences, and piracy. However, they have made that their number one priority. They have already begun establishing the necessary channels such as creating original content and MVPD partnerships in each country to gain market penetration. In the long-term, Netflix should face multi-year growth in these new markets.

**Why wait until Q4?**

Netflix will face some temporary headwinds in the short-term. The Olympics will be in Q3, and according to CFO David Wells, the Olympics will affect global gross additions negatively. It will be a small and temporary impact, but it will be meaningful nonetheless. Q4 is also a better time to invest is because it signals the end of Netflix’s un-grandfathering process. If it persists into Q4, it should not be for long. If Q2 results are anything to go by, we can expect the Olympics and un-grandfathering to create uncertainty and a decrease in global gross additions. Therefore, I suggest waiting till Q4 to invest in Netflix.

XLNX
Sector: Semiconductor - Integrated Circuits
Summary:  Xilinx, Inc. designs and develops programmable devices and associated technologies; software design tools to program the PLDs; targeted reference designs; printed circuit boards; and intellectual property (IP). 

Market Cap: 13.47B  P/E Ratio: 25.20

Reasons why I think BO negotiations are likely underway:

1. At earnings they guided flat, mostly due to a sequential downsizing of company backlog. Relying on backlog to guide, if a BO were in the works a backlog downsizing would make sense.  Since guiding flat, the intraday has been hitting annual ATHs.  

2. BO rumors first hit in May. Since then, XLNX has gone mostly silent — this is the longest period in the company’s history with no PRs (other than the requisite earnings announcement). 

3. Last week Pac Crest issued a PT at $65 (consider this as BO negotiating leverage).

4. Options chain has been lighting up the last month.  As an example, last Thusday 5k calls traded, 85% were at the ASK or in between. Only 147 puts, and almost 1/2 of those were sold. Friday was even more bullish. OI in calls has been skyrocketing. 

5. Potential buyers are QCOM, AVGO, and GOOGL. I personally think Google. [Here’s why]( http://www.wsj.com/articles/googles-high-speed-web-plans-hit-snags-1471193165 ).

16-08-19,4yl6so,Dumb newb who knows jack about investing/401ks/IRAs would really appreciate some advice. Please help.,"Reddit friends, I need your help! I am trying to ""adult"" right now and failing miserably...

Backstory: 20-something female who recently resigned from first job with a 401k in order to return to school full-time. I know very little about investing and am feeling like an idiot right now. 

I have to do something with my 401k from my previous employer. I currently only have about $1400 (fingers crossed the upswing I've seen continues until September when I have to have this finalized). After a bunch of research, I decided that a Roth IRA through Vanguard would be best for me since I am hoping to be in a much higher income bracket after I finish my degree and taxing it now seemed to make more sense. However, after speaking to my 401k plan provider, I realized I would be taxed 20% plus an additional 10% penalty due to my age, leaving me with only ~$980 (just shy of the $1000 minimum I need for the company I am considering). I expected the 20% tax, but was under the impression the age penalty tax only applied to having the funds dispersed directly to me. Apparently, the money is still subject to the full 30% if I choose to go with the Roth. She suggested that it might be best for me to roll it into a Traditional IRA (as I would not lose any money obviously), leave it there until I am employed again, and roll it over to my future employer's 401k. The downside is that I won't be able to contribute any money to it beyond the rollover, but I suppose that isn't much of an issue considering I resigned &amp; will not have much $$$ to add anyways.

Does anyone have any advice on which route to take or even something I may not be considering? Furthermore, I don't know if I should stick to a Target Retirement Fund or consider ETFs like the S&amp;P 500 (I honestly don't even understand ETFs).

 I am really regretting not paying closer attention to what I learned in my Personal Finance class in high school. I don't know jack about investing and this is a very intimidating process. I don't want to screw it up and I feel like I am shooting in the dark here. I would truly appreciate any insight anyone has to offer. I don't what the hell I am doing and I am so scared I will lose the little bit of money I have for my retirement. I know I should understand this more, but I keep running into so much contradictory information that I can't seem to make heads or tails of it all.  Please be kind and feel free to explain it to me like I'm five. Thank you so much in advance.

TL;DR: Have ~$1400 in 401k from job I quit for school. Will likely not have access to another 401k for some years. Don't know a thing about investing/IRAs and feeling lost. Should I take 30% hit and go with a Roth IRA or save the little I have an roll it into a Traditional IRA? Furthermore, stick to Target Retirement Fund or go with ETFs (Don't truly understand this route). Considering Vanguard as they seem to be both the most frequently and favorably mentioned.",1

16-08-19,4yla0m,Renault SA - Opinions?,"Hi all. Running a few screens this evening and Renault popped up in one of them that focuses on large-cap companies with price-to-book ratios below 0.85. I usually avoid automakers for long-term investments but this is a screen I use to pick out shorter term (1-3 year) profit opportunities.

Anyway, with 0.8 price-to-book, 7.1 P/E, very little debt (0.2 debt-to-equity) both compared to others in the sector and in absolute terms, a solid dividend yield (3.1%) and some hefty dividend rises over the last couple of years (+expectation of similar over the next couple), this looks like a decent opportunity to me.

The whole auto-sector is a little beat down at the moment but even if Renault reached the current average P/B (1.05ish) for the sector within three years, you'd still be talking a 31% uplift on the current price (+ dividends in the meantime).

Anyone else considered Renault or have any thoughts on them as an opportunity?

16-08-20,4ynzsf,Why is Google/Alphabet so cheap? Adjusted historic PE 20.8,"Up nearly 40% for the year and trading near historic highs at $775 Alphabet Inc still looks increadibly cheap.

At the end of July the company reported very strong Q2 results with revenue growth and earnings growth in excess of 20% and EPS growth over 40%.

For me the current valuation at 29.48 times trailing earnings looks quite attractive for a company with Google's apparently unbeatable lead in its search business alone.

However if you adjust the valuation to account for the huge cash balances and moonshot losses, that are holding back profitability, it gets even better;

Market cap ($540bn) minus cash ($78bn) = Adjusted Market Cap ($462bn)

Net Income ($4,877mm) add back moonshot expenses ($859mn [$687mn after tax estimate]) = $5,564

Or $22.2bn net income with an annualized approximation.

Using this back of the envelope estimate, the adjusted PE is a rediculously low 20.8.

Help us make WSB great again.,"~~In the recent weeks I’ve been away from WSB distracted with corporate hostile take-overs, planning a month long honey moon, and closing a multi-million dollar deal helping the government secure funds from non-other than the government (you read that right).~~

~~But I’m back now and while catching up it became evident that there’s a growing problem with the moderation in this subreddit.  Actually to be more specific the problem is with the~~ ~~*automoderation* of this subreddit and WE NEED HELP TO FIGHT THE AUTOMODBOT.~~


~~For reasons I’m not able to disclose, WSB uses a bot with an aggressive algorithm coded by another bot (~~ ~~[here’s the latest revision](http://i.imgur.com/mCpZTsX.png)~~  ~~- obfuscated to prevent cheating), to take care of the dirty work behind the largest trading related sub on the internet.  I have no idea who coded it or how it works but it’s extremely good.~~ ~~[Here’s a screenshot of 1 day’s work](http://i.imgur.com/T2pg96K.jpg)~~. ~~As you can see the bot does 99.99% of the work and the rest by 4 humans~~: ~~JPoor_The2nd bans some people (who presumably beat him at internet pissing match)~~, ~~SwineFluPandemic removes random shit,  SIThereAndThere turns around and re-approves them~~, ~~and finally bawse1 comes in to unban JP’s victims.   Their work actually cancels itself out. ~~

~~Overall we’re happy but there’s 2 important things to note~~:

~~1. Good/valuable content ends up mistakenly caught and removed in the nazibot’s efforts to dominate the world.  Here’s a~~ ~~[screenshot of an average day in modmail](http://i.imgur.com/Dy96U85.jpg)~~ ~~(I’ve highlighted the beginning of each thread)~~.  ~~Every message is about the automod and the patient mods take the time to respond to everyone with long ass conversations~~ ~~(greyed out)~~.  ~~Note the problem here is *not* that good content gets removed – it’s dealing with the aftermath in modmail.~~

~~2. People think the mods are all Kim Jong Un – censorship happy, power hungry, fascist virgins.  Every three weeks there’s an uprising [that results in WSB spinoffs]( https://www.reddit.com/r/yatch/comments/4rppn2/welcome_to_ryatch_the_newest_spinoff_on_the/). It’s crucial that we don’t ever change this.~~


~~So what we need is your help to fix the 1st point without changing the 2nd.  That is, we need volunteers to approve the innocent bystander content to prevent them from bitching in modmail – but to do it in a way that does not affect mod team’s reputation of being power-hungry basement dwellers.  This is easier said than done.   And yes I know mods get paid but it’s not very much, hence I call them “volunteers.”~~


~~Thanks.~~

16-08-20,4yoyi3,"Interest Rates Ready To Surge, Signaling An F-U To The Federal Reserve","Interest rates are nearing a key breakout. This goes in the face of the uber dovish Federal Reserve chatter from the Fed Minutes this past week. The bottom line is, interest rates can go up even if the Federal Reserve does not want them to. This is what is called an open market system. While the Federal Reserve can manipulate them through quantitative easing, lowering the Fed Funds Rate and other metics, ultimately, if time is up, time is up.

 

Interest rates are close to a breakout. This is likely to happen by early next week and it will be a huge F-U to the Federal Reserve. The big question is, how high will they go. In the chart of the $TBT which mirrors interest rates (yields), there is a down-sloping trend line connecting recent highs. There is also the daily 50 moving average. Both these points meet at the current price. When price breaks above them, it will be like a jail break and a mega surge is likely. It is possible to see the 10 year yield which currently trades at 1.58%, jump to 2.00%. While that does not sound like a lot, it is the equivelant of two rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.",0

16-08-20,4yp6jk,Mistakes I made recently with regards to my last dividend capture play (JNJ).,"On August 12th, I bought 1,759 shares of JNJ at $123.20, hoping to capture its dividend on August 19th. 

Since then, I've sustained a 2.67% unrealized loss, and this loss is nearly equal to the amount of dividends I've earned from my previous three dividend plays (F, WFC, and VLO). 

http://imgur.com/XQbk9D8

Before I begin, I would like to highlight the mistakes I've made with regards to my dividend capture strategy:

**1. Not using technical indicators.**

I didn't check indicators like RSI before I bought JNJ. The RSI had been dropping over the past couple of days before I bought my shares on August 12th, going from 75.31 on 8/1 to 35.38 on 8/12. 

Given the declining RSI relative to the other stocks I've bought (i.e., F, WFC, VLO all had stable RSIs in the days before I bought them) I should have waited before jumping into JNJ. I got in too soon. 

Technicals do matter if you are making short term plays like I do. 

**2. Putting all of my eggs into one basket.**

When I posted my JNJ trade, some people here questioned the wisdom of putting so much into one company. They were absolutely right, I was assuming too much risk and could be left without any capital to pursue other dividends should my play with JNJ falter. 

I didn't diversify any of my dividend plays because I didn't want to pay too much in trading fees, but in hindsight, I should have opened up at least 3 to 4 concurrent positions. 

Before buying JNJ, I was considering playing the dividend on SJM, MC, and SO. Had I spread out my plays I would have been able to get some of my capital back without assuming a loss. 

**So what now?**

JNJ is a solid company. I may have bought near the peak. Still, it's AAA rated and a 2.6% dividend yield with a sustainable payout ratio is nothing to scoff at in this low-rate environment. However, JNJ's growth is probably peaking, and they are starting to suffer from the law of large numbers that has plagued other companies like Apple. 

I'm just going to keep hanging onto it, take in the lessons I've learned, and just ride it out, as JNJ is a pretty solid company from a fundamental perspective. I will keep collecting the dividend and writing OTM calls in the meantime. I'm officially a JNJ bagholder and my dividend capture strategy has come to an end for the time being. 

Perhaps I'm just being a faggot and trying to justify bagholding this thing, but whatever. Just trying to share a few lessons for any of you who attempt a dividend capture strategy in the future - check the technicals before you go in, make sure the fundamentals are solid, and diversify your plays.

16-08-21,4ysxhz,"Natcore Technology (NTCXF) is the Best Penny Stock I have Come Across in Years, Explanation...","So I have had some good success with penny stocks in the past, particularly solar.  Not to boast, but I correctly called Solar3d (now called Sunworks) when it was on the OTC, now its on the Nasdaq.  Anyway, with whatever credibility that story may or may not give me - the stock I have been following the closest lately has been Natcore Technology (trades on the Canadian TSX as ""NXT"" and on the US OTC as ""NTCXF"").  Here is the rundown: The former heads of BP Solar and NREL are on the team as well as other PHDs, so they have one of the best teams in solar tech in the world.  Basically what they are trying to do is create processes that make solar manufacturing more efficient and then license their tech out, and they are close.  The other thing they are ramping up to is consulting large solar projects globally (they just landed deals in Belize and a huge one in Vietnam)  So first the tech - one interesting thing they have done is replace furnaces with laser tech that binds cell layers to reduce energy costs.  However, their greatest tech achievement by far is they have eliminated silver out of solar cells altogether, which is the highest material cost of producing cells.  Their silverless cell sits at 18% efficiency right now (which is competitive already) but they want it in the mid 20s to really hit a home run.  This is what they are working on right now along with their consulting business.  So what they want to do in the next year is wrap up the enhanced cell so they can present it and then license the tech out that it takes to produce such a cell to manufacturers including the new ones that they themselves are building.  Here are a couple press releases and their credential page:

16-08-21,4yt1yl,A thought,"Somebody replied to my post ""buy low, sell high"". That's fairly obvious. Then I went to /r/WallStreetBets and saw some threads about TA, and people talking about the efficient market theory.

And then I got a thought... Austrian economics is basically founded on the principle that the value of a thing is highly subjective and determined by those humans making the transaction. E.g. An entrepreneur may look at a shovel and see its utility value and calculate the profit he will earn by employing the shovel. A woman may look at the same shovel and see it as the last remaining artifact attached to her memory of her late husband. And a fool may look at the shovel and see it as nothing more than a stick. Those three people will value the same shovel very differently, and therefore will be willing to pay a different price for the exact same thing. The same can be said of other goods, e.g. tulip flowers.

It seems fairly obvious that this is true for stocks as well. A lot of people on Reddit may really like TSLA stock because they are infatuated with Nikola Tesla... er, I mean, Tony Stark... (Tony Stark founded PayPal and Space-X, right?) But they value TSLA even though the company has NEVER EARNED A NET PROFIT!!! Fundamentally speaking, this company is highly overvalued. There are thousands of companies that actually earn a profit, but are valued far less than TSLA, probably because they don't have a super famous billionaire genius who goes on TV and talks about video games and the Matrix and the possibility of malevolent robots.... among other reasons.

The point is, stock prices swing up and down for the EXACT same reason that an adult wouldn't pay a dime for a Charizard Pokemon card, but my 10-year-old-self would surely spend several dollars for the same useless card.


...... this is just a big long rant which basically concludes with a newfound appreciation for Benjamin Graham. Buy GOOD stocks (nobody wants a broken shovel for the same price as a non-broken shovel) that are CHEAP relative to ALL OTHER STOCKS.

I have a limited understanding of calls and puts and previously have not touched them because of the risk involved... but I'm contemplating delving in and here is why:

With the coming election in November I personally feel Trump is most likely to win, but if he doesn't we already know Hillary is anti-gun and if elected will cause a spike in gun sales causing stocks like RGR to rise.

Combine that if Trump is elected I wouldn't expect those same stocks to crash and burn, knowing those things would it not be smart to sell puts on RGR with a strike in the $50-55 range with an expiration anywhere in early 2017? 

The way this looks to me you'd get paid the premium for selling the puts with not a lot of risk involved... Hillary gets elected, RGR goes up and nobody takes the option... Trump gets Elected and the stock stays relatively the same, maybe goes down because of normal fluctuations... Maybe you end up buying at slightly above market.. but the premium might cover the losses you took... am I wrong here?",7

I was planning on getting a 401k, traditional ira, then any other funds dedicated for investments would go into a brokerage account.  My gross annual is 142,000.  My company doesn't have any match for the 401k and I've been doing some research on whether it makes sense to still contribute there or go straight to my brokerage and ira.  Nothing seems terribly conclusive and I was thinking based on an assumption that taxes will be higher when I retire it would be a better idea to forgo the 401k.

16-08-20,4yqess,The stock that will help me get my own yacht. Oh! I also believe they have figured out the recipe for hangover-free beer.,"The company in question is a small biotech firm from Finland called Biohit Healthcare. At the moment they have a market cap of €75M.

Their products and analysis systems are meant for the early diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases. Their Acetium innovation was developed to reduce carcinogenic acetaldehyde in the gastrointestinal tract. The key objective of their products is to prevent diseases of the gastrointestinal tract.

The company isn't making any profits at the moment but their products are being used in different screening studies in countries like Brazil, China and Russia.

[Biohit’s ColonView validation for colorectal cancer screening program in Brazil.](https://newsclient.omxgroup.com/cdsPublic/viewDisclosure.action?disclosureId=587280&amp;lang=en)

[Gastric cancer screening study to start in China, with at least 20 000 people to be screened by Biohit Oyj’s GastroPanel test, with over 50 hospitals participating.](https://newsclient.omxgroup.com/cdsPublic/viewDisclosure.action?disclosureId=668737&amp;lang=en)

[Colorectal screening project to start in Russia with Biohit Oyj’s ColonView test, with around 20.000 persons to be screened.](https://newsclient.omxgroup.com/cdsPublic/viewDisclosure.action?disclosureId=683828&amp;lang=en)

Also, [the Acetium lozenge was found to be a promising method to assist smoking cessation.](https://newsclient.omxgroup.com/cdsPublic/viewDisclosure.action?disclosureId=682964&amp;lang=en)

And the latest addition to the list of promising offering was [a co-operation with a small Finnish brewery.](https://newsclient.omxgroup.com/cdsPublic/viewDisclosure.action?disclosureId=718934&amp;lang=en)
I believe that the result of this co-operation is a beer that does not cause hangover. Why I concluded this? Well, you can read about it from [my blog.](http://www.huntingvalue.com/biohits-hangover-free-beer/) Outrageous advertising, I know but no one else has covered this topic, at least not in English.

So, I believe that Biohit is very close to sign contracts to nationwide screening studies to at least one of the countries mentioned. On top of this their acetaldehyde binding products have very promising applications. 

I expect Biohit to be a multi-bagger in future. When that happens I hope have been able to get a large enough investment in Biohit to buy my own yacht and to live a happy hangover-free life on its deck.

**Stocks in 4 out of 5:** XOM, MRK, MSFT, PEP, PG, UPS, VZ

Lessons to be learned?

a) Congrats! These high achieving fund managers did your DD for you. These are well-run companies. Buy!

b) Nothing/neutral. You don't know the entry price. These are commonly held stocks. Past performance doesn't predict future performance. Buy an index fund, etc.

16-08-22,4yxw2a,"It's not a sprint, it's a marathon.","Hello everyone,

This is my first post to r/investing…not so much a typical, “internet + $$ = ???” post like I’ve seen time and time again. I believe I have a rather genuine story to share but I am seeking some advice, towards the end of this post. I’m looking to have this post targeted toward investors who are in their late 20’s, to early 30’s. As a fellow young professional, I’m curious to know how you decided it was time to start a roth ira, or begin saving via a company 401k to see how it performs…that sort of story. 

So let’s begin! I am currently working full time at a bank in Pittsburgh, been here for over 3.5 years. It’s back office work, with limited client/customer interaction….unless we have to specifically reach out for something. 

It’s a big bank, their market cap is just shy of 43 billion (rounded), but the share price has been rather cyclical since I decided on adding some shares to my 401k. The cool thing I will say about the bank I work for are their benefits.  I’m starting to see this as a dividend to my….okay….of a salary. Healthcare is excellent and I receive “free money” every year in benefits like a Health Account for starters. Of course, this contribution is based on your marital status (just married, already got a credit for my wife). On top of the health account contribution, I have bank match 401k contributions as well as a yearly profit share match based on 2% of my annual salary. That translates into literally free money for just showing up to work and going about your life. There’s prescription coverage and paid time off…those sorts of things too, but this is an investing post.

I’ll digress a minute. When I was nearing 24 years old, I told myself to set a goal to land a job in downtown Pittsburgh. I’m very proud of that decision to this day since I’m still working for the same bank. Getting some good dividends now that I’m established.

Like all, I’m without a doubt certain that the time to start investing feels like running a marathon with no prior training. I’ve done three marathons now (Kona Hawaii being most recent) and I’m still learning how to be a better runner. All you need to do, like me, is show up to the race and take the first step. Then you take a few more steps and sooner or later, you finished a marathon and planned a 401k along the way.

 So I began looking into what investments were offered, how much are fees for having an advisor manage my account, what to do with bank dividends…that sort of thinking. Turns out, we don’t have a lot of options when it comes to investments, there are target date funds (years up to 2040 I believe), bank stock, small/large cap stock funds (these are going a couple hundred A SHARE), small cap/mid cap growth &amp; value funds, a global real estate option, bonds (high yield, core, and aggregate) some international and emerging market funds (not doing well right now) etc.. At first, I was really not sure what to do, my salary at the time was..not ideal, but I decided on doing a 4% contribution with the bank giving me 4% match. It helped in a big way, with he company match, accrued dividends and the profit share contribution.

Ok, so with all this said, let’s get into the details. My 401k at the moment, is standing at a 9% gain YTD with a current balance of over $12,200. This is comprised of a 7% contribution by me, with a bank contribution of 5% plus a .50 cent contribution per additional dollar over 5%. So this factors into a $345 monthly 401k investment. Now, I will admit, this 7% contribution I am currently making has only been for a 2 year period. Prior to my current role was when I upped the contribution factor and just ran a tight budget to account for my 200 a month 401k contribution plus the company match. Now that I’ve managed to put a lot more in, I do have a number to reach for this monthly contribution- 500 total between my salary and the company match. 160 a month is not that far off for where I’m currently at.

How did I accomplish this 9% gain and how am I maintaining this growth? I honestly got aggressive and took on some of those large cap/small cap stock funds that were basically like 500 bucks a share, so you’d imagine, over the course of a few years accumulating a handful of shares was…..not very efficient. The gains on paper were good. Before the Greece crisis, the energy crash in oil, Brexit, the beginning of 2016 drop I rode the wave, dollar cost averaging slightly based on the timing of my contributions. I also had a mix of bonds among aggregate and core, real estate holdings and the bank stock. Remember before I mentioned the stock was cyclical? I’ve noticed that finance stocks all tend to perform around the same parameters, up when the market is good, down when the market sells off. This time last year, it was in a sell period along with the market. So over time, I’ve adjusted accordingly and actually invested MORE into the bank stock to the point where I had just shy of 70 shares. The dividends where attractive, with the option to reinvest them, I couldn’t pass this up (compounding effect). Does anyone recall the beginning of 2016 when the market (in my honest opinion) was in a mini correction? At one point, I was down a good 500 bucks, the bank stock being one of the contributors, but also small cap was getting hit too. One person I talked to exclaimed a few thousand in losses for his company 401k. So, there’s a big opportunity here. Then look what happened with the Brexit again, a mini hit, but nothing catastrophic. So what I really was hoping to accomplish this year, 2016 was get to an end target of 13k. My account at the beginning of 2016 was around 8k so it’s made some progress. Now, when I saw the growth over the past few months, I really had to stop and think, can this last….? I made 9.38% as of two weeks ago….I decided it was time to preserve these gains and start on a new path. 

I discovered my 401k gives me complete control over all investments, NO FEES AT ALL!!!! There is an option like I stated earlier where an advisor can manage your account but there are fees involved. Over time, you tend to pay close attention to expense ratios and account maintenance fees. Better to know now, rather than later. 

The company stock and small cap stock funds were my focus, these saw the most of my gains, along with my core bond, so I transferred 90% of these holdings and gains into my existing core bond and a stable value fund. This is basically a savings account that ticks .01% over time, it has grown but at a very conservative pace. There’s also this option I was unaware of called a self directed account, that’s through a few mutual funds, but there are fees involved. The beauty about this core bond fund was the stability, while earning growth during all the turmoil we faced since 2014. If anyone is asking, why are you doing this now when there is another quarter left for the year… the answer to that question is, this is our election year. I am very curious about this upcoming election (not talking politics) based on previous election cycles (2008).  I want to finish this year on a high note, with my gains in tact and so far it’s working. If I reach my year end target of 13k then I know how to begin 2017. Invest in the same funds, accrue the contributions and dividends between company stock and the small/large caps and then transfer into core bond/stable value.

So this boils down to building a considerable 401k by myself at a young age, managing to hit 9.38% with another quarter to go, moving my gains into low risk and bond focused funds and continue vesting into the same funds I have been. Dumping the gains into those two funds along the way when I see fit. My end game with this company 401k account is to hit 30k in three years. May up the contributions based on future promotions. 

But that’s just my work account.

I also opened a Fidelity roth ira (it’s a beautiful thing) that I’m looking to begin the same process, but with a solid foundation built. I managed to do a max contribution on a prior year basis, so I’ll have the option one year to contribute 11k (prior year plus current year based on me doing an initial prior year contribution). Starting one account at 0 and another with 11k takes a bit of planning. All emotions aside, I want to wait until after the election cycle for the fidelity ira. A big part of me wants to time some things right based on my plans with that account. Fidelity offers a lot, more than I imagined. And honestly this is where I’m looking to hear from fellow investors. What do you think? What’s your thought process? How did manage to start from nothing and grew it to something today? What do you like about mutual funds? What about bonds? Stocks with dividend yields above 5% those sorts of questions, I’m looking for some creative answers based on the community of r/investing. 

It was interesting, there was a post on r/investing about this trader who managed to earn 360k on XIV. An etf that behaves the same way our stock market behaves. It’s ugly cousin, TVIX likes to be the one who comes in plastered after everyone left the party. A bad metaphor, yes, but I’ve seen TVIX literally go to 0 before it reverse split. I say this because time and time again this goes down, does a split and repeat. Yet the dow jones and volatility have not crossed in a very, very long time. Check some charts out, every time we had a “crash” the volatility index and the dow crossed paths into opposite opportunities. Now, I mention this because someone on the traders profit post said that XIV could be wiped out in a short period of time. The same effect, a Vanguard fund lost 90% of its value the investor claimed. Why this little detour? Market behavior, trends, decisions, goals.  All components of an investment strategy right?  I hope others who read this post say yes. 

I have a plan for my Fidelity account, the questions I have though are more so….what did you like about one particular fund compared to a competitor at, say Vanguard? Honestly, is there a different between a Fidelity mutual fund and a Vanguard? Aren’t some mutual funds overlapped like you get the same investments, but it’s a different diversification?? Fidelity does offer Vanguard funds, but not (in my research) the gambit. I like the utility sector (boring, absolutely) but the risk is manageable and we will always pay utility companies. There are a ton of mutual funds ranging from low conservative type risk to very aggressive. The ones I found weighing on the 40+% risk area shown good 3 yr returns but more recently it’s different based on the markets. Stock picking has never been a joy of mine. It’s how I starting investing at 21 on a 100.00 zecco account before they got bought and it was penny stock picking. Risky? Yep. Foolish? Open to debate. Worth it? ABSOLUTLEY. I owe a lot to my best man at our wedding, whom I’ve known since I was a teenager. Over the years our relationship has evolved and he pushed for me to invest in myself. Well I can say that’s been paying invaluable dividends today. 

So that’s my post, it’s rather windy at times, but the destination is what I hoped it would be, clarity. Hope to read some of your comments if you have the time to go into the details. Just a disclosure, my investment options are solely my opinion and should not be sought as investment advice to make money for your own reasons. I am not a financial advisor, so don’t go run off and invest into something based on what I posted. I’m just looking to share my story, and get some tips on what others think about my company 401k plan and my roth strategy. 

Thanks, Marathonman091516

http://www.investopedia.com/university/introduction-to-dividends/investing-in-dividend-stocks.asp

Compound dividend takes 20 years for 100% return if you only use compound dividend and the stock price does not change. 

""Your $5,000 investment would grow a bit more to $11,650 over the next 20 years, for a total gain of 133.01%.""

It took me 2 months for 66% return with penny stocks. So, I need like 5 months for that 20 years of pathetic slowass investment. Penny stocks are obviously superior and faster if you know what you are doing.

16-08-21,4yv46e,Quick easy question please help,"Hello I am having trouble finding the answer to my question on how dividends exactly work. If you have a quarterly paying dividend does it tally up each month and give you the three month total or just payout the percentage of where you are at the end of the quarter?

EX: $1000 of stock with 3.0% dividend&amp;yield 

Is the answer 
A. 1000x0.03 = 30 x (3 months) = 90 ?
or 
B. 1000x0.03 = 30 ?

So my question would be is the quarterly payout for this stock 30 or 90? 

If it the answer is only 30 then wouldn't monthly-paying dividend stocks be a tremendous advantage?

I'm playing the longest expiry possible so that there's enough time for external events to bring value to my puts.

16-08-22,4yyd6m,"MTCH- Motley Fool's Re-Reccommendation to buy Match.com this last Friday, Aug. 19th for Stock Advisor customers...","We had a great time on our first date with Match Group (NASDAQ: MTCH), and we'd really like to see it again.

This portfolio of online dating services offers lots of ways to find love, from the eponymous Match.com to OKCupid, Meetic, Delightful, HowAboutWe, Chemistry.com, OurTime, BlackPeopleMeet, PlentyOfFish, and more. But it's no secret that the company's recent success has been driven largely by ""hook-up"" app Tinder. Tinder remains a global phenomenon, handling over 1.4 billion swipes (profile views) and 26 million matches every day. It's the fifth-most-popular app by revenue in the world (excluding games), and management expects it to double its paid member count in 2016 — ending the year with about 1.6 million paying users.

Since I first recommended Match in April, its stock has jumped more than 30%, while the S&amp;P 500 has barely gotten off the couch. Whether you already own shares or not, we think it's worth getting to know a little better.

More Reasons to Super Like

Tinder reminds me in some ways of my brother's re-recommendation this month, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) — a wildly popular social site that resonates with millions of users on a daily basis. And, like Facebook, Match is still just learning how to optimally monetize its service.

So far, it's been hitting home runs. Tinder Plus launched in March 2015 with premium features like the ability to undo a left swipe (a profile you passed over) and the ability to change your location to chat with users in other parts of the world. But the company also cannily limited the number of right swipes (likes) available through the free service. That drove lots of avid Tinderers to the tiered subscription product. ""I've never really seen the monetization of business go as smoothly as this has from a standing start,"" said CEO Gregory Blatt in the company's most recent conference call.

Indeed, users' willingness to pay for access has given the company a fair bit of latitude in how it grows profits. It introduced ""Super Likes"" last October, allowing users to swipe up instead of right to show an especially high level of interest in someone (once a day for free users, five times a day for premium members). That gave the company a nice bump in paid member count and continues to drive incremental revenue as users pay a la carte for additional ""likes.""

In July, the company launched Tinder Social — aimed at groups looking to meet up, plan activities, or join others. (The company is quick to note that it's not a ""group dating"" app; in fact, management believes that one benefit of Tinder Social will be to decrease any remaining stigma around the core product.) While it's too soon to know much about its impact, this is a nicely adjacent market for Match, and its connection to Tinder's popularity should give it momentum that similar concepts like Foursquare and Dodgeball never had, while also driving users back and forth across the group and dating services.

Moving Cautiously

Match has been understandably cautious in its approach to monetization, not wanting to spook the users who have created such a powerful network effect. But as a result, it has lots of levers that it hasn't even begun to pull. Subscription pricing is tiered to age but varies widely by geography (and by the length of subscription). The free version of Tinder still allows users a generous number of likes — 100 in 12 hours — before cutting them off, a number that could certainly be tightened. Match can continue to introduce a la carte features as a way of both adding revenue and encouraging users to subscribe. It can experiment with different features and price points by gender (paying subscribers skew heavily male, which works for Tinder because non-subscribers can still make matches, but it may not be ideal).

But even with so many experiments left untried, business is booming. In its second-quarter report, Match reaffirmed its top-line guidance for the year: The company expects revenue of $1.1 billion to $1.14 billion, although its adjusted EBITDA target came down slightly to a range of $400 million to $415 million, owing to some stepped-up investments.

Management believes free cash flow will be at least 50% of EBITDA, suggesting it will easily exceed $200 million this year. Match should certainly be able to beat that margin in the future, considering that free cash flow clocked in at 65% of EBITDA in 2015. But even using that target suggests the company is trading between 19 and 20 times estimated free cash flow for this year. That's not especially expensive, particularly in comparison to other software-driven services. In fact, it's far cheaper on this basis than fellow IAC/InterActiveCorp  (NASDAQ: IAC) spin-outs Expedia (NASDAQ: EXPE) and TripAdvisor (NASDAQ: TRIP), as well as popular app-driven businesses like Yelp (NYSE: YELP) and social networks like Facebook and Twitter (NYSE: TWTR).

Right now, the company is investing in new product initiatives — and not just for Tinder. International growth is particularly strong, and it's being led not just by Tinder but also by Meetic, a leading European brand. Management has also acknowledged that it hasn't applied the necessary resources to grow the Tinder advertising business, another area of focus. In part because of this, profits aren't keeping up with revenue and cash-flow growth, but I expect that to reverse next year, with the company leveraging top-line growth into improving profit margins.

Risks and When We'd Sell

The caveats that I outlined in April — Match's relatively high debt load and IAC/InterActiveCorp's 84% ownership stake — remain true today. But this especially: Take out Tinder and the acquisition of PlentyOfFish, and the rest of the business — from the conventional dating sites to the Princeton Review and Tutor.com education services — is essentially flat.

Average revenue per user has been declining because the company's mix of members is moving to cheaper services like Tinder. However, that trend has slowed: ARPU was $0.55 in the second quarter versus $0.58 a year earlier. That 5% decline marks a sharp deceleration from the 14% in the fourth quarter of last year and 10% in the prior quarter.

Nevertheless, Tinder has to keep growing rapidly, particularly if the rest of the business treads water or worse. While Wall Street reacted ambivalently to the company's most recent quarter — many investors were hoping for even faster growth in paid member count — management has consistently said that with so much in flux, short-term forecasts are difficult. We're satisfied for now that the company is making the right moves. But keeping up growth could be difficult if users find alternative services that are cheaper or serve them better. While Tinder has critical mass, alternatives like Bumble — started by ex-Tinder execs — and Hinge are gaining traction. If users start swiping left on Tinder itself, we'll reevaluate.

The Foolish Bottom Line

Many users of traditional online dating services sign up hoping to find love and make the service obsolete. While that goes for some Tinder users, too, Match has found that this is a ""periodic consumption business,"" meaning that people tend to be intense users for a time, drop out, and later return. That makes for a more stable base to build on, as the company brings in new users but also keeps existing ones for longer. Count us part of the trend: After a few months, we're swiping right on Match Group for a second time.",5

3. You've got myriad banks, trading desks, smart money managers calling for a collapse.

They make a lot of fucked up calls driven by inside dealing but this isn't ""oh you should short Facebook"" and then it pops.  This is people that have made millions or billions saying ""I have never been so nervous""

4.  Of COURSE the market can still go up.  But that's what a YOLO is, right?  If you're willing to YOLO on random movements in AMD or whatever other shit you need to be willing to YOLO on market correction.  If you lose, you lose.  But the likelihood of market correction at this point is far greater than you correctly picking the direction of random stocks - which is an outright coin flip

5. If you're in - there's all sorts of ways to do this.  Buy puts on SPY or SPX or whatever you can afford.  Buy puts on IWM or RUT or whatever you can afford. If you want to go more YOLO buy calls on something like SPXS

But don't be a fucking idiot about it.  Market corrections don't tend to happen all in one day and the severity is unknown.  Don't buy something that requires a 20% drop or some shit for you to breakeven.  

Good luck dickheads.

(32% of portfolio)40 shares of ATVI(average cost $32.50)

(27% of portfolio)25 shares of SBUX(average cost $57.20)

(12% of portfolio)15 shares of SCHD(average cost $39.97)

(8% of portfolio)5 shares of GILD(average cost $97.50)

(8% of portfolio)6 shares of GIS(average cost is $72.11)

(7% of portfolio)4 shares of XOM(average cost $93.90)

(2% of portfolio)17 shares of MFA(average cost $7.15)

Portfolio Value: $4,986.65 Currently +5.51% this year(I started invest stocks this year)

as you can see, I'm not very diversified, but I'm trying to be more. As a 26 y/o investing potentially for retirement, I'm unsure if I should go more into growth stocks or go into dividend stocks. I was thinking of adding a few shares of KO to my portfolio but I already have SCHD. I'm not sure if I want to add a blue chip stock or not. I feel I could add a little more risk then what I have now?

I'm looking for a direction with my portfolio, I'm not looking for ""tell me what stock to buy right now"". But if you have a particular stock worth mentioning I wouldn't mind looking at it.

Thank you guys !",0

Further supporting this forecast is that silver prices jumped in June following Brexit and a jump in silver prices is usually almost certainly followed by a pullback, as history shows. ",0

I have a question on covered calls - let's say that a stock is trading at $100 at moment. I have 100 shares in that stock. I sell one covered call with a January 2018 expiry and a $105 strike. 

I get a fat premium up front, but I'm of course on the hook for the shares should the party I sold the call to wish to exercise. The stock price goes up to $106 several weeks later. 

From your experiences with covered calls with an expiry well into the future, once a a stock's price hits the strike, do people on the other end exercise the call, even if they paid a huge premium for it?",0

16-08-21,4yw536,I NEED to sell premium (Canada),"I hate to be this guy, I really do. I promise I'm not a noob some of you may have seen my user name around here.... But here's the thing, I need a new broker. I use Investors Edge and it's OK but I need to get into the big leagues of selling premium and I can't do that with my current set up. 

I currently trade with a TFSA account which only allows selling of covered calls. I can buy puts and calls as well but cannot sell naked. I also cannot short stock. 

I'm tired of this shit, I want the full spectrum of strategies at my disposal. I could open an regular (non TFSA) account through Investors Edge but I don't think the platform will support placing a simultaneous order for the 4 different contacts needed to trade an Iron Condor for example. 

I'm looking at ThinkOrSwim through TD. Are there any Canadians here who have set this up for selling options on American equities? How did that go?

Are there any other brokers in Canada that are well suited for option strategies? I plan on keeping my TFSA in Investors Edge and throw some more money into another brokerage account to utilize selling premium. 

I'll be looking at Optionhouse today too and seeing what they offer Canadians. 

Any help would be appreciated, sorry for the Noobish ""What broker should I use"" question. I'll GFM now. ",2

16-08-22,4yysem,Finally applied for a Margin Acc. Have a few questions.,"I've read several examples online (OptionsHouse, Scottrade, Investopedia, etc) and do not think I have a solid understanding of trading with margin, so before I use any margin I want to have a firm understanding of how it works. 

Let's say I have $10,000 in my account without any stock. 

What is my day trading buying power (DTBP) with a maintenance requirement of (1) 25% and (2) 50%? From what I've read, I'd assume (1) DTBP = $40,000 = $10,000/0.25 and (2) DTBP = $20,000 = $10,000/0.50. Also, the $10,000 I have in cash would be known as the maintenance excess, correct?

If I have a DTBP of $20,000 would I have a total of $20,000 available to trade stocks/ETFs? This seems obvious, but I haven't traded on margin so I'm not making any assumptions. 

What is my maintenance requirement assuming a DTBP of $20,000 with a minimum maintenance requirement of 50%? I'd assume $5,000 = maintenance excess * maintenance requirement = $10,000 * 50%.

Last one. If I have $10,000 in cash and decide to buy $13,333 worth of $JDST, using all the DTBP available. If $JDST drops by 23% the next day, I will have $10,266 at this point and $10,266 - ($13,333-$10,000) = $6,933 in maintenance excess. I will receive a margin call because my maintenance excess = $6,9333/$10,000 &lt; 75% minimum maintenance (3*25%) requirement.

Hopefully this helps others as well.

16-08-21,4ywm8v,Does tax on safe(r) returns make pursuing riskier investments more mathematically rational?,"This question is about a basic principle and may not apply to the real world, but I'm curious if it does, how much so.

The very hypothetical scenario:
An investor's safe assets bring in $10,000 in yearly income, taxed at 15%.  Same investor also invests $3000 in a highly volatile stock which could swing 50% in either direct over a yearlong period, is that essentially a completely safe bet now?    For simplicity sake, assume that stock 'will' swing 50% in one direction with equal odds, and that the safe investment always generates a $10k return.

If capital losses can be used to offset the tax due on capital gains, and $1500 of that $10,000 is lost one way or another, does it matter if it's thrown at a Wall Street roulette wheel, rather than given to the government?  In this case aren't you essentially gambling with the government's money?

Is there some legal limit to this kind of gambling?  Are the other considerations that make this less rational, or perhaps am I fundamentally misunderstanding it all (entirely likely)?",1

16-08-22,4yzkuf,"Amazon's valuation is crazy","ON THE POSITIVE SIDE........

When I see Amazon's PE drop from 1,000 to below 200 I think - 200 is still a crazy multiple but maybe at these levels there is some logic behind it.  Amazon's online retail business has built up a lead over competitors that yields huge economies of scale making it the lowest cost provider and difficult to catch - even when it decides to ramp up margins.

In the latest Q2 earnings report net income increased from $92m to $857m as operating income increased from $464m to $1,285m.  

Annualized at $3.5bn would put amazon on a PE of 100.

HOWEVER.........

However $413m (c.50%) of this $821m operating income increase was driven by cloud services rather than the online sales business.  Does the cloud business deserve such a high multiple?  I know its fast growing with huge potential and high costs to switch provider, but with so many competitors its unlikely that Amazon will be able to dominate.

Compared to Amazons biggest cloud competitor with a PE of 27 the valuation looks rich.

In fact if we strip out the cloud business (50% of earnings) and price on 30 times multiple ($52.5bn) we can see the remaining online retailer is priced on a multipe of about 170.  Admittedly the company reported revenue growth of 30% but how does that get you to such a multiple?

FREE CASH FLOW...

Commentators say we should look to Free Cash Flow as a better indicator.  Indeed it has some merits and Amazon reported FCF (TTM) of $7.3bn up from $4.4bn.  However, I definately think we should deduct stock compensation of $2.5bn (and the use of finance leases make this indicator less reliable to say the least).
With an adjusted (for stock compensation) FCF of $4.8 the market cap of $355bn is ""only"" a multiple of about 70.  I struggle with rationalizing this type of multiple for the fortress online retailer business that is probably uncatchable - but with half of the earnings coming from the competitive cloud business I find it crazy.  Can anybody shed some light?

Please be aware of high risks.  This is not advice to buy or sell.

For example: If you have a vehicle that tracks the top 200 entities of a market and the companies between 195 and 205 fluctuate in market cap, that vehicle will have to buy and sell accordingly. This makes the price of the 195-205 companies extremely elastic, extending daily/weekly highs and lows because these huge funds have to track the index. 


Also, weird ass ETF's are starting to pop up because some dude with a shit load of capital can start up his own fund and charge a management fee. Check out VXX, if anyone understands this thing please let me know because I've got no bloody idea. 


Anyway, just my 2 cents. I'll Probably get downvoted to oblivion because any negative mention of ETF's in this sub gets you executed.

16-08-23,4z6q8e,Buying Apple stocks now could be the biggest mistake of 2016,"My investment banker friend's thoughts:

1. Samsung's stock price is going through the roof and this usually coincides with a fall in Apple stocks. Hint hint, look at 2012~2013. Samsung's curved OLED flagships are proving too popular and their profits exceeded analyst's estimates. Semiconductor sales are improving too. 

2. 40.4 million iPhone units sold in the third quarter ending June 2016, versus 51.2 million sold during the same period the prior year. That's a whopping 20% drop in iPhone sales year-on-year.

3. Another worry is that 18% of iPhone sales in the 3rd quarter were from the iPhone SE, which has a lower profit margin compared to the iPhone 6S/6S Plus. 

4. Apple is not going to release a VR product this year, most likely. 

5. Apple's next growth engine is VR. They will release it in 2017. Expect Apple's stock price to go up significantly in September 2017, but not this year. 

6. From the leaked photos, the iPhone 7 looks exactly like the iPhone 6S without many improvements. It gives iPhone users little reason to upgrade. 

7. The best time to buy Apple stocks in 2016 was in July 2016, when Apple's stock price was hovering around $90. Warren Buffett took advantage of that. Now that time has passed, and I doubt it will go up much higher for the rest of this year. My prediction is that it will stagnate considering that the iPhone 7 will most likely be a disappointment, both in terms of design and features. ",0

16-08-22,4z0kde,How much studying is enough studying?,"Hi all,

And **thank you**. When I thought it was about time I'd find a way to invest my savings, instead of leaving them in my bank, the first thing I did was to come on this subreddit and search the past discussions. I found a list of books and resources recommended to beginners like me, and I've already read:

* The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing by Larimore, Lindauer, LeBoeuf
* The Little Book That Beats The Market by Joel Greenblatt
* One Up On Wall Street by Peter Lynch
* Dhandho Investor by Monish Pabrai

At the moment I'm reading ""The Guru Investor"" by John P. Reese and Jack M. Forehand (this one wasn't recommended here but I was interested into looking into the top investors' strategies), and I also started [Shiller's course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-markets).

I'm not sure if what I'm experiencing now is *paralysis by analysis*, lack of real  motivation or if, after scratching the surface, I'm realizing how much time consuming it is to invest: I am starting to wonder if it's worth to keep reading and studying on the subject or if I should just give up and put my money in Index funds.  
What I wonder is: how much one has to study before they can invest on the stock market with some hope of making a profit?

According to the sidebar:

&gt; As you learn about investing, you'll see there are different style types. Some of them take many hours per week for those who choose to go this route; others take mere minutes per month. In addition to the risk factor of your portfolio, you'll have to decide how much time you want to put into your investing, and make that part of your decision.

Of course I'm not talking about day trading, forex, or professional funds managements, basically I'm not talking of investing as a daily job. And at the same time, I never assumed you could simply read a couple of books and consider yourself done. But I was under the assumption it didn't take so much time and effort when the time horizon was long (over five years, up to twenty), and the goal was value investing, buying a few good stocks and waiting. Even more so, after I started reading those books (except for Bogleheads' one of course).  
All of these books stress on how easy is for the individual to learn investing and how mutual funds should be avoided, but once I want to get *to the beef*, it seems to me that it's not so easy. I tried reading Damodaran's ""The Little Book of valuation"" but I immediately got discouraged (also, searching a bit, it looks like many people don't like his methods).  
According to your experience, **is it really possible to invest in the stock market without making it a second job, something to focus on for hours a day?** Is it really possible to just dedicate a few hours per week to it?

Sorry, this message came out a lot longer than I expected but I didn't want you to think  that I was asking for the magic formula (well, Grenblatt gave one), and I hope I won't sound like a lazy ass: I know it takes some time and effort, but reading some advices given in the past here, people suggesting to take a course in accounting, another in economics etc., it feels like someone asking for a fitness advice to start working out at the gym was told to first give a couple of exams in anatomy, chemistry, etc. Is there a middle ground? Or that's the minimum requirement?  
(At the other extreme there are the ones who say ""just start investing already, experience is everything!"" which is something I don't agree with, at all.)

  
Thanks for reading.  
I looked for a sub like /r/learninvesting for newbies like me, but there is none. Since I'm not asking just for an advice for my current situation, I didn't use the daily advice thread, sorry if I was mistaken in that.  
Also: English is not my first language, I apologize in advance for the mistakes.",31

There's always some news that tried to bring it down as the short interest is goddamn stupid money, but lots of money.
Yet VRX keeps going up consistently as the new management is actually doing its job properly so far.
I expect the stock to reach the high 30s in the next week or two.
This would be a faster gain than AMD (that all of you jerk off to) since VRX isn't as much of a bubble.

I don't have much money in VRX, just 6 OCT 21 $35 calls (bought at open one day because I'm not allowed to trade while at work due to regulators), but I plan on putting in more either today or tomorrow.

16-08-22,4z10uj,Why you should be Bearish on Brazil,"There are a number of countries whose stock market performance is directly represented by an MSCI Index. MSCI indices are used as the base for Exchange Traded Funds. By trading these funds, investors are able to profit from being bullish or bearish on a country as a whole.

Let's take a look at Brazil, and more specifically the following ETFs:

iShares MSCI Brazil Capped ETF (NYSEARCA:EWZ)

-This fund seeks to track the investment results of the MSCI Brazil Index. A.K.A it directly correlates with the Brazilian economy.

Direxion Brazil Bull 3x ETF (NYSEARCA:BRZU)

-This fund seeks the daily investment results of 300% of the performance of the MSCI Brazil Index. A.K.A it directly correlates with the Brazilian economy 3x. These types of leveraged funds are big with short term traders, and it could be argued that they represent an even more accurate short term picture of how investors view a nation as a whole.

EWZ is up 68.67% YTD.

BRZU is up 239.53% YTD.

With these numbers it would seem that investors are fairly confident in the Brazilian economy. Could it be because of the past World Cup and the Olympics? It must be.

Brazil is a country who has been suffering for the past decade with national deficits, terrible consumer spending, a lack of infrastructure, poverty, pollution, and above all else corruption. Within a month, 3 presidential cabinet ministers were forced to step down after being accused of major fraud. Conveniently, they were also in charge of a project created to revive consumer and investor confidence in the nation. If that isn't bad enough, their national bond grading was recently lowered to junk.

At the start of 2016 EWZ was the lowest it's been since 2004! The Brazilian economy is not in a good situation. Investors must think that the Olympics will give the country the boost they need to get back on track.

I disagree, and here's why:

It's a fact that hosting the Olympics doesn't have a long term positive effect on a country's economy. In fact it can actually hurt it.

In the short term it seems different: tourism is booming, jobs are increasing (construction), and the country's infrastructure is improved.

The opposite is happening. It cost Brazil 20B+ to be the host country. They're expected to recoup only 3B of their initial investment. That's a huge loss for a country that was already facing intense debt and poverty.

They were supposed to create 8 water treatment facilities to reverse pollution. They had to cut the project short and ended up only building 1 (green water). Another plan was to build new train routes and improve transportation. For some reason they only connected the Olympic villages. That can't help them in the future.

After the Olympics is over on August 21, there is going to be sudden loss of tourism. No one will want to stay in these substandard villages. Brazil will be left with useless infrastructures and stadiums that can't help rebuild their economy. There will also be a reported loss of 50k+ jobs. 70,000 worked on construction alone to prepare for the games...they're suddenly out of work.

The Point: Brazil has obtained false investor confidence as a result of the Olympics and their indices are being overbought. Once investors realize that Brazil is actually worse off than they started, the indices will reverse.

My Suggestion:

Buy ProShares UltraShort MSCI Brazil Capped ETF (NYSEARCA:BZQ)

-This ETF seeks daily investment results that correspond to two times the inverse of the daily performance of the MSCI Brazil Index. A.K.A. if Brazil goes down in flames this thing goes to the moon.

BZQ is at an all-time low!

If you can get into this anywhere in the 19-20 range your so set. My guess is this will hit 50 by this day next year.",1

Before I'm going to exhaust you guys with my list of questions I would like to thank the people who created and participated in this sub, it looks extremely well organised, lively and informative. Alot of thanks for that. 

So let's hop into it then, I traded some times before in my life with 500plus and had quite bad luck with it (although not losing that much) so I thought let's skip it, but at the same time now I want to try it again since I was always interested in economics and politics.

I do have some questions however involving this issue so that my 'hopes' and my efforts don't get smashed away so quickly, so here they come: 

1) Many people accuse daytrading/investing etc to be similar to gambling, is really just luck or more different ? 

2) As a person who is interested in politics, should I limit myself more to Forextrading ? 

3) My goals, for the coming months let's say, are to make around 50 euros a day at my worst and 100 euros a day at my best, how much should I be able to invest in it ? Aswell as in which broker, I've heared about 500plus but heared bad things from several people about it which makes me doubt. 

4) I know the book tips, and I'll go get some books tomorrow but what is the one thing that you would say to this 19 years old kid from Belgium who wants to start trading ? What is like the cold truth about it or what is the number 1 rule you would give me ?

16-08-22,4z1crs,Are REITs overpriced?,"REITs typically offer a great dividend and have become more favorable in the current yield environment. Lately, there have been articles pointing to a bubble in REITS and talks of overpriced REITs. 

Looking at a REIT like Public Storage (PSA), we see great performance early in the year and a sharp pullback lately. PSA traded as high as 28x FFO (funds from operations) this summer and now trades closer to 24x. Historically, the stock has traded between 22x and 26x. Based on valuation and the current strength of the company's fundamentals, PSA actually looks fairly priced or even cheap. 

A similar conclusion can be drawn for REITs like Realty Income (O) and Agree Realty (ADC). Based on historical valuations, all of these stocks appear fairly valued. What do you think?

3 REITS I'm researching and would like input:

NSA - Same business as PSA but it trades at 19x FFO and is growing quickly.

STWD - Commercial mortgage REIT that trades at 11x FFO and offers a huge dividend (8.5%) and appears fundamentally sound.

CLDT - Hotel Reit that trades around 9x FFO. Hotel REITs that have done poorly over the past year and while the fundamental story is not as pretty, this one seems quite undervalued. 

What are your thoughts on REITs?

16-08-23,4z47bk,Thoughts on CGC,"Canada may legalise weed in 2017. This is a big event and may drive up a lot of stocks.

Canopy Growth Corp: CGC (3.87 Current price. All over the place as it's still fairly new. Probably going to drop fairly significantly in the coming month).


Canopy Growth is based out of Smith Falls ON, and from my understanding is a combo of two companies/brands. Tweed, and Bedrocan.


Tweed seems to be the more recreational part of the company, and will most likely profit heavily once weed becomes legal.


Bedrocan is marketed as the medical alternative. Also, dabble in edible mixes for baking. They (Tweed) got their license to produce in March, and will get the license to sell once their first crop gets tested.


In 2015 they got rated #1 in customer service according to their wikipedia page.


Bedrocan is also a very promising part, as they have been around for 20 years, and were producing medical marijuana for the Netherlands government for over a decade. They also have a “compassionate” pricing model, offering all their strands at $5 per gram.


Their ON facility is pretty huge, at 350k square feet, and are expected to be the largest producer. They entered the TSX in June, that's when the hype for the company went into overboard.
The Good: Very large production capability.


Although Tweed is very young and haven't even had their first harvest, Bedrocan is very established, and has proven itself for a very long time.


Only stock on the list to be offered on TSX.
2 separate companies under the same label somewhat gives me reassurance.


The Bad: New stock, very fresh.",0

The main thing stopping me is I'm normally a dividend/value investor and have never bought shares at a 40 P/E.  But this growth company is looking cheaper to me when the consumer staples I normally would favor have traded up to P/E around 25.  Any thoughts?",0

They tell me ""Good For You"" with a sarcastic undertone. Even when I made the biggest play in all of Tesla history I was made fun of for living in my Mom's basement.


Protip: Basements don't have windows fayget.


This is just the start. Interactive Brokers is now DENYING ME the right to buy options because I'm under 21. I can't drink alcohol, but at least I could make enough for a yacht right? WRONG.


I believe that this is protected under the first amendment, as buying options is a form of self-expression. I have already emailed the Supreme Court, and I am confident they will rule in my favor. But that isn't the point.


My point is: I may be a kid. I may be a little immature, but how else am I supposed to get my yacht and move out of my parent's? Listen here. I am your new profit. And just in the way that I use my friends to buy me alcohol, I'm going to use you all to make money. I'm going to give you the best fucking tips you've ever seen and then you're going to get home at the end of the day and GFY because of all the money I made you.

I'm not sure how long-lived the spike will be once it happens, but in general, earnings should be higher than expected across the board for companies selling wireless data. These earnings will be driven by data limit overages and of course wireless plan upgrades.

**Key findings:**

* Flash Eurozone PMI Composite Output Index(1)
at 53.3 (53.2 in July). 7-month high.
* Flash Eurozone Services PMI Activity Index(2)
at 53.1 (52.9 in July). 3-month high.
* Flash Eurozone Manufacturing PMI(3) at 51.8
(52.0 in July). 3-month low.
* Flash Eurozone Manufacturing PMI Output
Index(4) at 54.0 (53.9 in July). 8-month high. 

**Comment**

Commenting on the flash PMI data, Chris
Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS
Markit said:

“The August flash PMI indicates that the eurozone
remains on a *steady growth path* in the third
quarter, with no signs of the recovery being derailed
by ‘Brexit’ uncertainty.

“The survey data are consistent with the region’s
GDP growing at a quarterly rate of 0.3% in the third
quarter, or 1.2% annualised, which is similar to that
seen on average over the first half of the year.

“A solid 0.5% pace of expansion in Germany is
being accompanied by a return to modest growth in
France in the third quarter, while *the rest of the
region is also seeing growth pick up* after slowing in
the second quarter.

“*While the resilience of the PMI in August will add
to the belief that the ECB will see no need for any
immediate further stimulus*, the weakness of the
overall pace of expansion and disappointing trends
in hiring, order books, business optimism and
prices all suggest that policymakers will keep the
door open for more stimulus later in the year.”

The nugget of truth behind the fallacy is that with multiple years the standard deviation of the annualized return will be reduced, which is true.

The fallacy arises from the assumption that the standard deviation of your TOTAL return will be equal to standard deviation of your annualized return.  That is false.

If you want the math behind this, here's [a short summary](http://www.gotohaggstrom.com/The%20fallacy%20of%20time%20diversification_July2010.pdf) and here's the [original work by Merton and Samuelson](http://www.people.hbs.edu/rmerton/fallacy%20of%20log-normal.pdf).",64

I am waiting for this to hit 0.4. (I bought at 0.025.) It is doing fantastic.

Operational Highlights

Royalty rates for natural gas in Ukraine declined from 55% to 29% effective January 1, 2016 which materially improved the Company's netbacks and net income.

Production averaged 1,185 boe/d (98% natural gas) for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, which decreased 16% as compared to the 1,414 boe/d in the comparative 2015 quarter and decreased 28% from the 1,644 boe/d production averaged for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in production for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 was a result of the temporary suspension of production at the RK Field due to the termination of a gas blending contract. The Company hopes to resume production in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Achieved average natural gas price of $5.55/Mcf and condensate price of $52.89/bbl during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 as compared to $7.08/Mcf and $46.89/bbl for the comparative 2015 quarter and $6.23/Mcf and $28.29/bbl for the first quarter of 2016.

In February 2016, the Company received an additional 5% interest in KUB Holdings for a total 35% equity ownership interest. The Company has the ability to further increase its ownership interest from 35% to 40% on meeting certain benchmarks and optional payments.

In March 2016, the Company was granted a 20-year term production licence in western Ukraine. The Uzhgorod licence covers approximately 75,000 acres which is a 50% increase from its original size of 50,000 acres.

On July 8, 2016, the Company announced that it has entered into a share purchase agreement (""SPA"") and shareholders' agreement with a third party, whereby the third party earns a 50% interest in the Company's newly formed subsidiary, CNG Holdings Netherlands B.V, which, in turn, owns CNG LLC (Ukraine LLC), 100% owner of the Uzhgorod production licence in western Ukraine. Pursuant to the terms of the SPA, the third party is to (i) pay Cub EUR1.5 million ($1.6 million) upon transfer of the 50% shares (""Closing"") (paid subsequent to June 30, 2016); (ii) fund a 100 square kilometre 3D seismic survey within 20 months of Closing; (iii) fund the drilling of first three wells within four years of Closing; and (iv) fund the tie-in costs of the first three wells up to a maximum EUR0.2 million ($0.2 million) per well within four years of Closing.

In August 2016, KUB-Gas spud the M-23 well. The well is planned to a total depth of 2,550 metres with multiple objectives.
In August 2016, Tysagaz located a used nitrogen rejection unit (""NRU"") in the US to be utilized on the RK Field in western Ukraine. If successfully installed and operated, the NRU should assist in the resumption of production at the RK Field in the fourth quarter of 2016.

I put in some cash got back to 600 and last week had a 50% week.

I read 3 books the intelligent investor, the making of an American capitalist, and the complete turtle trader. ( I also read the millionaire real estate agent if it can count 4th book because I was supposed to pick properties with investing in as a real estate agents ago assistant for a time.)

Honestly I don't know if I'm doing well or if it's just luck trading on gut feelings. I don't like speculating on a companies worth I was up 10% last week but I held UWTI over the weekend and sold yesterday unsure if it would be up today. I'm trading purely based on a half assed guesses reading charts and looking at trading volume, finding my picks through finviz. I don't plan on breaking into other options until I hit 5k but I want to know if I'm just getting lucky or if I'm legitimately doing things right. I couldn't buy based off of technical analyses of companies and my attempt is 4 weeks going down my portfolios history.

Everybody in the college will be listed on the leader boards and I want to use this as an opportunity to **prove** that WSB's trading philosophies of not diversifying my portfolio, trading highly volatile stocks, and yoloing my 10,000 virtual dollars on options will provide me the best returns.

Over the years, my assets have increased, and now my positions are starting to feel excessively large (re: risky).

They also insisted on delaying tax-exempt investing until a large emergency fund is established (that will last 1 year or more), although they would be okay with regular taxed stock trading accounts. One of the parents is an CPA accountant.

From my friend's and my understanding, the IRS will allow tax and penalty free withdrawal of both Roth accounts if it can be proved that the money was contribution money and not earned money.

Example question: Contributed a total of 11K to the two accounts and then earned 1K in stock value increase and dividends by the time the 11K needs to be withdrawn from the Roth accounts. How will the IRS see that?",1

16-08-23,4z9evn,How probable is an extension to the Plug-In Electric Drive Vehicle Credit (as it relates to Tesla sales)?,"Background: Tesla is currently benefiting from the [*Plug-In Electric Drive Vehicle Credit*](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/plug-in-electric-vehicle-credit-irc-30-and-irc-30d), a federal income tax credit on the sale of battery-powered vehicles. The maximum credit for a single vehicle is currently $7500, and is proportional to the capacity of its battery, and not the overall cost of the vehicle. Once Tesla has sold 200,000 electric vehicles, new Tesla buyers will no longer be eligible for the full credit. The plan includes a ""phase-out"" period which will decrease the subsidy in increments to zero over the course of one year.

Dollar-for-dollar, any per-unit tax credit which remains by the time Tesla reaches volume production on the Model 3 should have a much larger impact on its sales of the Model 3 (and the number of people following through on pre-orders) than it had/will have for the more expensive earlier models, since the credit represents a much larger fraction of the sales price (assuming Tesla doesn't jack up the price in the interim).

In your opinion:

1. When - if ever - will the government extend the 200,000-unit limit on the credit? Can you see them doing it just in time to ""bail out"" Tesla (just as Tesla's allowance expires)?

2. Will Tesla reach the current unit limit and exhaust the credit phase-out period before it starts rolling Model 3s off the line (considering its history of design delays)?

I know this is all wild speculation, but I'm interested to know what you think.",7

16-08-24,4zd75f,A little bit of hand holding with amd options requested.,"I understand how options work in theory, but I've never traded them before. This appears to be a whole 'nother ball game respective of just knowing what they do.

Lets take a look at jan 20th options for amd.

So, the lower the strike price for a call option the more 'built in' value it has.

| contract price | strike | current amd price | amd price - strike | contract price - (amd price - strike) |
|----------------|--------|-------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 2.19           | 6      | 7.57              | 1.57               | 0.62                                  |
| 1.6            | 7      | 7.57              | 0.57               | 1.03                                  |

The last column seems to be the amount you're 'paying' just for speculative value increases... or the amount you'd lose if amd were to remain the same price and you held to the last day. 

| contract price | strike | speculative price | investment | shares      | value       | profit       |

""In a filing Tuesday afternoon, SolarCity SCTY, +0.30%  said that Tesla TSLA, +0.86%  chief executive (and SolarCity chairman) Elon Musk has agreed to buy more than half its latest offering of bonds, putting $65 million toward the $124 million SolarCity hoped to raise. ""

Honestly, I have nothing against Tesla (just against the threads that offer nothing but ""Elon is going to save the world""), but this is not the first time that Musk has taken down a large amount of Solar City bonds (earlier this year, SpaceX bought $90M of SCTY bonds - ""After market close yesterday, SolarCity revealed in a SEC filling that it expects Elon Musk’s rocket company to buy $90 million of the $105 million in new Solar Bonds issued."")

""Last year, SpaceX already purchased solar bonds from SolarCity on two separate occasions: another $90 million followed by $75 million. SpaceX’s involvement in SolarCity’s Solar Bond Program is set to total around $255 million, which should help finance a lot of solar installations.' (https://electrek.co/2016/03/22/elon-musk-spacex-solar-bonds-solarcity/)

Musk can call SCTY bonds a ""good investment"" (obviously, he's not going to say otherwise), but his apparent desire to buy up (or have other entities buy up) the majority of SCTY bond offerings seemingly each time out is starting to become rather ... curious. Is the demand for these bonds just totally not there otherwise?",173

I know a lot of people agree that passive investing through ETF index models is the way to go, but of course there are managers who achieve a positive alpha over a long period of time (5 and 10 year averages). 

This being said, most advisers will tap on a 1% fee, which of course decreases performance and makes it less attractive.

Because I work in the financial advisory space, I am wondering what people would need to see on a performance side (alpha) and what they would need to see on a fee side (how low) to make them happy and to make it an attractive investment. I figure if I can increase accessibility and drop the fee substantially- people might actually like that.

16-08-25,4zgu9d,Cash vs Gold ETF (1-3 yr horizon),"Question: On a 1-3 year outlook, is there a clear favorite between Cash in a 1% yield account vs a Gold etf (GLD)? Or is it a coin flip?

In-depth: I understand just enough about investing to know that any specific position I choose (as an amatuer) will win or lose mostly due to random luck (as opposed to my reasoning). So, for my personal situation, I generally ascribe to a broad index / buy &amp; hold strategy. With that said, my spidey senses are very skeptical of the market right now (risks vs rewards seem asymetric). Rationally, I know my amatuer market feel is no more than a gut opinion guess. However, with all decisions in life, Im very hesitant to make a big move against my gut.

Currently, I have $150k I was gonna put down on a house. I've decided to just rent for at least another year and reassess my local housing market / personal situation then. I expect in about 2 years, I can stack enough $ to afford a full cash buy in my price range. Its possible that in 2 years, equity returns will improve significantly above the mortgage rate, and thus I'll opt to put 20% down &amp; invest the remainder. However especially in this currently side ways trend, I expect the cash buy option would enable discount opportunites on distressed properties, that far outweigh the next couple years of forecasted equity returns. So unless something significant changes (like a major correction / buying opportunity), I think it'd be wise to keep this current 150k + a future $200k relatively liquid until early 2019, both to keep my options open, as well as avoid deploying a large lump sum into a market that nobody seems to like.

Based on that scenario, should I hold gold or cash?",1

Shopify $SHOP (or $SH on the TSX for filthy Canadian fucks like me)

A few months ago I saw that this stock and it was still trading lower than it was after its IPO. Earnings were soon and I wanted a small YOLO. I posted in this sub wondering if any of you had an opinion on it, but I think you were all to distracted by fucking ETSY (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/4hpz8q/etsy_just_crushed_earnings_revenue_and_eps_beat/d2rhxp6)

I bought it anyways because online shopping is hype AF and why should this company be less valuable then its IPO when it has been growing well??

Earnings went fine and they beat EPS but this POS stock dropped off a clip anyways, rose again, then dropped with brexit again. I finally sold this unexciting stock for a meager gain July 11. 
http://imgur.com/tLfuHdP

Of course the rest is history and this stock decides to launch itself 30% towards the moon, leaving me with no gains.

16-08-25,4zhktt,Trinity Industries looks cheap with PE of 6.36,"Trinity Industries is a diversified industrial and construction company that saw its stock price halve from $50 after it was sued for providing defective guardrails that were claimed to have caused a number of fatalities.

The company is appealing a $663 million judgement against it and claimed (in its latest earnings call) that it has provided ""compelling arguments why this case should not have been brought to trial from the start, and why the judgment should be reversed"".  Trinity expects a ruling no earlier than late 2016.

 While the outcome remains uncertain, despite Trinity's assertions.  The valuation looks compelling even if the judgement is maintained - and even better if it is reversed.

The company has cash and short term investments of $814 million, stock holders equity of $3.03bn and  operating cash flow (in 2015) of $940 million so should be able to cover the judgement without much difficulty.

The stock has fallen 50% to $25 and with a PE of 6.36 appears to have most downside scenarios already priced in.

Because literally everything is going up and we can ride this to the moon guys. 

1. UVXY: Market drop yesterday will cause a rebound across the board causing even more volatility.
2. LABD: Because Hillary's hit was just a catalyst to popping the biotech bubble.
3. XBIT: dropped too much, shows promise and someone mentioned it and I like Xs. Might go Long to right before their ER in Oct then sell and short because they are spending too much. 
4. MYL: TEVA didn't get their patent accepted and MYL got hit hard, it will pop up a little to around 45 at least. 
5. AMD: because you cucks chickened out on an stock we are supposed to be going long on till sept/Oct. That being said, I currently have too much in AMD (50%) so I am going to cull my horde and make it less of a risk. Diversify that shit. 

**Getting the fuck out of gold**, too much uncertainty for me and if the fed goes up VIX will pay more than gold.

New investor here, I've been reading Burton Malkiel's ""A random walk down Wall Street"" (Great book so far, very accessible for beginners). I took particular interest on his take on market efficiency: ""the market is so efficient - prices move so quickly when new information does arise - that no one can consistently buy or sell quick enough to benefit"". So the question I had was exactly how fast is market efficiency? 

I got my answer when the department of Justice announced they were ending the use of private prisons. Big news on Reddit, couldn't miss it from the front page. The earliest article I could find an exact time stamp for was Mother Jones. (I think it's possible that another news article posted an article on the subject even sooner though.) but here's how fast the market is:

This time we're nearly 2 years in and oil prices are still sub 60$, meaning less fly by night and less desperation (since the fly by night and desperate may already be dead).  Similar points can be made about the Cushings inventory. This gives me a bit more reason for hope that these gains are actually legitimate and may last this time.

16-08-25,4zfu85,Game plan for Yellens speech on Friday,"Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

Yesterday the 23rd S&amp;P was hella up, and everyone was hoping to break 2200, but it didn't and just kinda sat around 219x all day, before ending the day pretty shitty. I am not sure what caused the rally up, if someone can fill that in it will be lovely.

Today it fell a good amount. I think because of oil inventories. We were expected to have a -.5m inventory but we actually had a 2.5m positive inventory meaning bad shit for oil prices, and that brought everything down with it. (Also maybe coupled with fear of interest rate increase on Friday)

To my understanding Yellen is going to give the speech at market open on Friday. So we should watch Thursday and pre market Friday pretty closely.

How many of you guys actually feel that interest rates are going to rise? How many of you think interest rates remain unchanged?

I'm thinking that I want to buy some calls tomorrow if I can time the bottom well enough (depends) and I believe she won't raise interests and the s&amp;p will return to near 2200 levels.

But I was thinking about grabbing SPY calls, while also picking up a couple OTM SPY puts just incase for security. I'm no expert.. What are you guys doing ?

If the stock is now trading at .12 wouldn't that potentially give buyers a gain that the stock is now being offered at more than double the price?

So here's my potential criteria:
Mid and large cap stocks on NYSE or NASDAQ
&gt;= 4% yield and &gt; 1M 10 day average volume
General uptrend for the stock and proven solid companies with buy or hold ratings. 

I feel like this could earn 1% return in less than two days investment period. Churn the same money once a week and it could be a big return.

2. She hates giving up detailed policy talks at these things.  She's being cornered into it because of circumstance but be aware that no indication given doesn't necessarily mean no rate hike in her view - it could just be her being braver and truer to herself than expected and leaving out detailed policy talk

3.  No matter what she says the FOMC is a majority rules vote.  So even if it's her view that there should/should not be a hike (particularly that there should not be), and even though she carries the most sway - if the ever creeping tide towards a hike weighs out in a couple weeks you could have the utmost surprise hike which is a hike after she's said nah.

I emailed my broker (Lightspeed) and asked if it was a glitch, and they said that it was because they hadn't adjusted to the reverse split yet. after about 30 mins they sent another email saying the numbers will have adjusted already, and told me to log out, then log back in, and the numbers should be back to normal.

Everyone should be frustrated. I'm hoping that this is an inflection point for this country. Our healthcare is in a crisis, it's no different than the mortgage financial crisis back in 2007. This bubble is going to burst.""
http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-08-25/mylan-ceo-us-healthcare-system-bubble-going-burst-no-different-subprime-crisis (includes full CNBC interview.)

Bolded the part above because - as I've said in other posts on here, I think we are going to have to have a serious discussion again in this country about the healthcare system because the current system is not sustainable. A lot of companies are going to have to change and find that the environment where price increases like Mylan/Epipen are no longer going to be ""tolerated"" - you're going to be dragged through the press and court of public opinion.  

However, while pharma is likely going to have to face changes (and if not now and we put it off, we're just going to have to have a worse discussion later, where the anger of the populace is much worse), there's going to be some middlemen in the healthcare industry that are perhaps going to have difficulty finding their role if we have to revamp the system substantially.

**Edited to add: speaking of middlemen, look at the PBMs down - CVS -3.25%, ESRX -4.4%**

Also, Mylan (MYL) up after the CEO's appearance on CNBC this morning and that's already wearing off as MYL turns negative.

Additionally, another Hillary tweet saying Mylan's actions are not good enough.

So I did some research before creating this thread. September 16th is the expiration date. Assuming you buy $31sept16 calls, if the stock doesn't hit that price before then, you lose the money you spent on the contracts.

So right now, I am interested in the $31sept16 calls for SWHC. It is trading at $0.73. My broker charges me $10fee + $1.50 per contract (per contract meaning x100 of the calls?). If I was to buy 1000 $31sept16 calls, that would cost me $730 + $15 for the 10 contracts + $10fee = $755 total. 

Then I would have to pray to God that by September 16, SWHC is trading over $31. Otherwise, I lose $755. Is my understanding correct on how these things work so far? ",18

None of the other potential advisors sounded decent, perhaps I didn't shop around enough. An added advantage is their 1.5% they took out per year is now added to the profits.

The risk potential is about the same(100% stocks). I traded financial stocks for tech stocks I felt were undervalued. Because of those decisions the portfolio jumped up 5%. Now because of the pending yellen speech it went down by about 3%. We're still up by about 2% from the original portfolio, while the original portfolio is still about the same price. It dropped by about a 0.5% since the beginning of the week though.

Perhaps it's a bit too soon to deem it luck or genius. Perhaps it'll all still be luck all the same. But I can't help but be a bit worried, so I thought I would compare to others.

I was pitched a stock by family members and they love it but I'm having trouble understanding it. 

The company is called Founders Advantage Capital and it has a slightly different investment structure than private equity funds. 

It makes &gt;50% investments in strong companies and also will hold them over an infinite time horizon. 

What I don't really understand is that it's considered to be in the mortgage broker business in Canada. That, and even though it's turning a profit, it's still listed on the TSXV (Toronto stock exchange venture exchange). 

If anyone could help dissect the company or explain why it's considered a mortgage broker when it makes equity investments that would be great!

16-08-26,4zmvvj,SGBY Crushing it for me,"They operate cannabis testing labs in the state of Oregon. All cannabis products must be tested legally by October 1st. 

They have three locations in Oregon with a new sales director in Portland which would indicate that at some point soon there will be one there as well for a total of four. 

They just announced today a new cannabis testing lab acquisition in Northern California and stated that this is the first of many strategic moves in this state, which would bring the total to five. 

The company has stated that there are over 26,000 potential accounts in the state of Oregon and that the Northern California market is the largest in the world, so let’s speculate that that represents a conservative 50,000 potential accounts. 

The company has stated that each account represents a little over $1000 in annual revenue. They’ve stated that the original three locations had 700 accounts with 1000 as a reasonable expectation over the next few months. 

They also stated that this new location has 500+ accounts and that is only scratching the surface. If and when they announce accreditation in Oregon, it could mean a lot of their current competitors get left in the dust even further driving up their numbers. 

If each location just averages 1000 accounts which is a realistic expectation, here are the numbers… 

One Lab w/1000 accounts = $1M x 33% x S&amp;P P/E avg. of 25 divided by O/S = .0112 per lab. 

They've closed on three in only a few months, may have a fourth in the works in Portland and now one in Northern California. At the rate they’re moving, that’s around FIVE every six months or TEN per year. 

TEN locations x .0110 is a TEN CENT STOCK+. 

This is a plain and simple explanation of why this stock is so attractive and why it is easy to measure where we are and where we are headed. 

Each acquisition or new location using the numbers above basically represents a penny in value in a mature market.

16-08-26,4zn565,How much in long calls on Nokia till Jan 2018? (5k-10k out of a 30k net worth),"Long calls on Nokia till 2018?

Once 5g rolls out, telecom company stocks are going to go through the roof.
I've never bought calls before, but I was one of those people who put 50% of my net worth in AMD at $2. I did trade out a few times and I no longer own AMD.

I think Nokia might be onto something.
Huawei is not allowed into the US market, Nokia and Ericsson are the two biggest players in the US now and both have had their stocks pummeled by lack network upgrades... 4G has been around forever and is rolled out to all the big cities, so not much money in that. Samsung is the third player that US Telecom companies will pit against either Nokia or Ericsson (other continents pit Huawei against other major network infrastructure players).
Knowing Samsung's work ethic, I'd say those guys are going to go places. The question now becomes, will it be Nokia or Ericsson that gets the short end of the stick in the US market?
In my opinion, Nokia will get a boost earlier on because of its aggressive 5G rollout vision. Nokia is trying to jump the gun on 5G, even while a global standard has yet to be set, this may allow for dominance by Nokia or a massive mistake as it rollouts the wrong technology (think Spring Wi-Max flop). 
Note that Nokia just received approval to work with Chinese state-owned Telco China Telecom (massive contracts where Ericsson is not approved to work but Huawei dominates). This will slightly improve their stock price  as they roll out a 4G network over there.

Ericsson will play more a more conservative 5G role, its management team is in shambles and its not really in a position to make any crazy bets, especially considering it was partially responsible for the Sprint Wi-Max meltdown... And their CEO left the company only a few weeks ago.
The other variable with Ericsson is that they are currently one of Verizon's favorite rollout partners. Verizon will likely be the first US Telco to rollout 5G, it has a close partnership with Ericsson. It will likely rely heavily on Ericsson services for its 5G rollout.

My net worth is 40k, I've had a 20% return yoy for 2 years now buying/selling stock. Graduated 2 years ago with 17k student debt.

I've never traded options before but I think going long on Nokia for 1.5 years is a good bet/call.

I also like Alphabet and Amazon.  They probably have the strongest and most dynamic cloud services tailored for large businesses, I just wish I could afford their stocks, at this point, to be honest.

Cloud services are part of the future of tech.  Whether it's keeping patient information private and secure in the health care sector, or whether it's an intelligent cloud that helps an autonomous vehicle be more functionally autonomous.  How do you plan to invest in cloud services companies, to stay engaged in the future of the tech sector? How do you plan to diversify your tech sector, whether it's with cloud services or otherwise?

16-08-25,4zk8v2,Asset allocation - the bond conundrum,"Modern Portfolio Theory tells us to have a healthy diversification of bonds depending on your retirement timeline.  Does it make sense to scale back mid-long term corporate and US bond funds (like VBMFX &amp; FTBFX) in favor of short term bond funds or individually holding a long term bond?  

Bond prices have increased the last 30 years as yields drop, but now that yields are at the bottom, they can either hold or go back up.   The benefit of mid-long bonds now is increased prices from investor demand.  However does the interest rate increase risk outweigh the portfolio diversification &amp; potential gains of investor demand in a crises?   Average maturity is 8 yrs in VBMFX, the fund should go down 8% per 1% increase in rates.  

It may still take a few years, but when inflation does eventually kick in, rates will go up quicker and these bond funds will get crushed right? For the portfolio with 15+ years, does it make more sense to limit bond allocation and keep what you do have in short term bonds?  

I am considering something like this 
60% Domestic stocks
10% Foreign stocks
15% Gold/Silver
10% Short Term Bonds
5% Cash - to play with options and put in domestic stocks in the event of a crisis.  (I know not everyone will agree with this or want to do it but the idea keeps me happy)

At the time of writing, SCTY is $22.27 and TSLA $221. There are some interesting bets to be made here if you assume the deal will go through:

$22.27 / 0.11 is $202.45, so buying SCTY here is effectively buying TSLA at $202.45, an 8.4% discount.

If you buy x SCTY shares and short 0.11x TSLA shares then when the deal goes through these positions will cancel each other out and you keep the 8.4% difference.

The only risk is if the deal doesn't go through or the terms change. Deal's supposed to close in Q4, within 4 months.

If there are holes in this strategy that I'm not thinking of, I'd love to hear.

The real next closest competitor for a low-cost alternative was Adamis Pharmaceutical who lost their phase 3 because the FDA wanted more data. And there was TEVA whose product was delayed until at least 2017.
Mylan has the market and they know it. There is nothing close to coming out to compete. Their price inflation was huge so profits could easily increase. Investor sentiment is against them and therefore they are down a bit. I think they will lower the price of the pen but it will still be higher than before.
I think the time is ripe to move in. Thoughts?",2

16-08-25,4zkyx3,What investments did you actually make when you were younger and how did they work out?,"I see plenty of users in their late teens to 30's ask for investment advice from their fellow Redditors. So I ask now, what investments did you ACTUALLY MAKE 5...10...20...30...40 years ago and how have they played out. I think we'd all love to hear the good, the bad and the unique.


For me? I fall into the age bracket stated above, so I've only been investing for about four years now, but I'll kick this off anyways.


Stocks &amp; ETF's: The few stocks I did pick actually blew the market out of the water (60-70%). I went basic with ETF's so returns in-line with the market.


Bonds: Waste of time. Was afraid to invest this money into something riskier because ""I liked cash and thought I would need the money soon"". Oh well, better than the savings account.


Late-stage Venture Capital: Invested in some well known private companies and have seen some great paper gains. Great risk/reward for someone my age with extra cash they don't mind possibly losing it all.

I bought PTX at $0.81/share, and it immediate dropped down to 70-75cents. I don't see it going up in the near future.

Analysts have said they see the stock going up 700% in the next year (that's a long time to go without day trading, I'm addicted), but I'm not sure if I should just sell and take a loss, then try and make it up in other day trades (Today I wass tempted to buy XCOM at 0.60 in the premarket and it got up to almost 0.90 today... but I didn't have the cash unless I sold my PTX)

Or if I should wait it out and hope for a jump.

This is my first hiccup I've had in a month of trading and not really sure how to handle it.

Any recommendations would be appreciated.",2

16-08-26,4zomtx,Icahn trying to unload HLF? Ackman a buyer? Joke or smell of victory for Pershing Square?,"Carl Icahn has recently discussed selling his stake in Herbalife Ltd. to a group including the company's arch-nemesis William Ackman, another surprising twist in a battle between billionaires that has riveted Wall Street for years. 


Investment bank Jefferies Group LLC has been seeking over the past month to find buyers for Mr. Icahn's 18% stake, which is worth roughly $1 billion, people familiar with the matter said. The status of the talks and which other investors may be involved wasn't clear and Mr. Icahn may sell nothing in the end. 

The fact that he even entertained selling his shares, by far the biggest single stake in Herbalife—and that Mr. Ackman could be a buyer—adds more drama to a tug of war over a once-obscure nutritional-products company that Mr. Ackman says is a pyramid scheme, an allegation it denies. The latest development is especially surprising given that just a month ago Mr. Icahn expressed renewed confidence in Herbalife, which in settling a closely watched Federal Trade Commission probe announced he was allowed to boost his stake to just below 35%. 

Mr. Ackman kicked off the fight in 2012 with a widely watched presentation and a $1 billion bet that the stock would collapse. Mr. Icahn joined the battle a few months later and soon after got several Herbalife board seats. Since then, the men have screamed at each other on live television and they and the company have traded legal accusations amid multiple investigations and a feature-length documentary that premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival. 

Herbalife has fought back just as fiercely against Mr. Ackman. The Los Angeles company has maintained throughout that it doesn't break the law and accused Mr. Ackman of market manipulation. The stock price has gone decidedly in the company's and Mr. Icahn's favor, rising roughly 70% since he first disclosed his bet on the shares in February 2013. Its shares closed Thursday at $61.93, nearly double Mr. Ackman's breakeven price in the low-$30s range. Herbalife has a market value of about $5.6 billion. 

Last month, the company settled with the FTC, paying $200 million and agreeing to make changes to its business. Mr. Icahn and Mr. Ackman both claimed victory. Mr. Ackman said the business changes would lead to a collapse of the company. 

Mr. Icahn countered that the settlement proves Herbalife isn't a pyramid scheme and said the company would thrive. 

""The cloud over Herbalife is gone,"" Mr. Icahn said then. It isn't clear why he may be willing to sell now. 

Mr. Icahn has been selling several stocks this year amid his wariness of the overall market, even ones in which he has expressed confidence. In April, for instance, Mr. Icahn exited Apple Inc., which had been his biggest investment and whose shares he often predicted would rise dramatically. At the time, he said he continued to support the company's management and believed it would flourish, but he had made a large profit. 

Mr. Icahn often works with Jefferies on such deals, including the exit of a block of shares in Hain Celestial Group Inc. in 2013. 

That Mr. Ackman would consider buying, however briefly, into a company he has waged a crusade against is less surprising than it might seem. He had only signaled willingness to buy a small portion of the stake, one person said. He has long blamed Mr. Icahn for boosting the stock, saying it's something he hadn't bargained for when he plotted the campaign. 

""I would love to find a way to get Carl out of the stock,"" Mr. Ackman said at CNBC's Delivering Alpha conference in July 2014. 

He has promised to take his quest to shut down Herbalife ""to the ends of the earth."" 

Rumors about Mr. Icahn possibly selling have periodically helped push the much-rumored shares down, including earlier this week. 

Wall Street has often appeared more captivated by the thrill of watching two giants of investing go toe-to-toe than by the underlying issue of what qualifies as a pyramid scheme or a legitimate business. 

Herbalife sells products including nutritional shakes and meal-replacement bars through a network of distributors who can also sign up new recruits and get paid based on a portion of what they bring in. The debate over the company turns on whether or not Herbalife's business model allows legitimate entrepreneurs to sell its products. In the first quarter, the company reported a profit of $96 million on sales of $1.12 billion. 

Mr. Ackman contends it is all a scheme that allows a group of individuals to prey on unsuspecting newcomers whose own purchases create incentive payments up the chain but have little hope of finding buyers for the goods. 

Mr. Ackman has made several multiple-hour presentations that have gone into excruciating detail on his arguments, which touch on Herbalife's ""nutrition clubs"" and its business in China. He billed one presentation as a ""death blow"" only to see the stock soar as he pitched his arguments. 

Other big names in investing took the other side of the bet from Mr. Ackman, a common occurrence in the highly competitive world of Wall Street. 

In early 2013, the fight took on a different proportion. Messrs. Icahn and Ackman both wound up on the phone with CNBC at the same time. Mr. Icahn called Mr. Ackman a ""crybaby in the schoolyard."" Mr. Ackman retorted that Mr. Icahn was ""not an honest man."" 

The two men ended their feud the following year, when Mr. Ackman called Mr. Icahn to make peace. They hugged on stage at the CNBC conference and Mr. Ackman hinted that he would be interested in buying Mr. Icahn's stake in Herbalife. 

""It's blessed to forgive,"" Mr. Icahn said he had told Mr. Ackman. ",14

16-08-26,4zp5gj,How I screen fundamentals to identify where to invest next in the stock market,"I like to trade at least a couple times a month, I'm in no way a professional investor but I consider it a hobby and a productive way to stay engaged in what's going on around the world. Throughout this year I've used specific fundamental criteria to determine which stocks to look at.  

This is not a recommendation and I'm not guaranteeing anything, I'm just explaining my investment idea.  

I use the following criteria to identify stocks to watch:  

market cap over $300m  
float short over 10%  
target price 10% above price  
P/E &gt; 0  
Future P/E &gt; 0  
Debt/Equity &lt;1  
Return on Equity &gt;0%  
Sales growth past 5yr &gt;0%  
Return on Investment &gt;0%  
PEG &lt;1 (optional)  
Earnings within the next month  

This translates to, I only buy decently sized companies that are profitable, have a positive outlook on their future, don't have too much debt, analysts are expecting the price to go up but for some reason people are shorting, and their earnings release is somewhat soon.  

From there I dig in and check news articles and quarterly filings, see what their EPS surprise factors are, and see how their sector is doing. For those that I still feel comfortable investing in, I'll typically go for whichever has the lowest P/E that doesn't correlate to the P/E of other profitable companies in their industry.  

After getting a general understanding on where the company could be heading I'll keep an eye on their short interest (reported on the 1st and 15th). if the short interest remains steady or increases then I'll choose to buy about a week before the earnings release date.  

In buying a week before earnings I've been able to ""ride the covers"" and sell for a profit the day before earnings, since shorters typically cover right before earnings if they're worried the stock is going to have a good earnings release.  

I've been tracking stocks with this method for under a year across various industries (except drug companies, they scare me) and typically use finviz.com as a screener for the criteria.  ",6

1. limit/reduce my cost basis per trade
2. higher profit probability
3. reduce commission fee


I'm fairly bullish even with rate hike probability. I hope there is no major disaster/terrorist act that would throw the algo to the shitter.

ITT Tech just had their student aid taken away from them and are currently fighting to remain an accredited educational institution. Stocks down 85% YTD. Even the retards in congress are waking up to what a fucking scam these schools are. The next big scam school stock going into the trash bin will be Apollo Educational Group. For those of you who live under a rock, Apollo owns The University of Phoenix. You know, that school where they send those morons after they get out of the military so they can adapt to not shooting at people.  

Revenue is down 70% since the lawsuits and the crackdown began in 2013. Here is a revenue chart for those of you that can read. **Numbers are in thousands.** (I know that's more zeroes than most of you have seen in your lives)

**REVENUE OVER LAST 4 YEARS**

2015 | 2014 | 2013 | 2012 | 
---|---|----|----|----|----
$2,566,277 | $2,996,865 | 3,613,851 | $4,253,337

---|---|----|----
$29,755 | $209,304 | $248,526 | $422,678

As you can see, this company is basically fucked. When they get slapped the same way ITT just got slapped, they'll crumble faster than the remnants of that subway cookie that has been accumulating in my beard. Student Aid money is well over 75% of their revenue. The military recently launched an investigation against the school after thousands of complaints from veterans. The investor relations department is going hard after the ITT incident to come up with ""Evidence"" that University of Phoenix is a legit educational institution. Of course all the numbers they come up with for graduate employment are pulled out of their investor relations departments ass.

16-08-26,4zqajb,Buy TLRD before September 7th. This time with more DD.,"Price target for TLRD's [next earnings report](http://ir.tailoredbrands.com/press-releases/detail/1786/tailored-brands-announces-fiscal-2016-second-quarter) is $17 in my expected scenario. If they announce that they've made *much* better than expected recovery, I expect the price target to be around $22 instead. As with all earnings reports, future outlook is more important than the actual EPS number. So look out for their quarter-to-quarter improvement for Jos. A. Bank stores, and projected improvement for the remaining year. I wrote a short, poorly written article on the topic. If you want to read it, message me and I'll send you a link. 

Now that we know consumer spending is what propped up economic growth in the past quarter, my outlook for TLRD is even stronger. Price target remains the same regardless, but higher consumer spending is always a reassuring sign when it comes to retailers. 

-

-

I've been on Tailored Brands for ages now and tweeting about them for weeks. Only after I had a huge win on Macy's did I go even deeper into TLRD. After I sold all of my September $15.00 strike calls for a 50% profit last week, I bought back a small portion of my original holding yesterday (at 85 cents per call). I thought I pulled the trigger too early because share price kept going down. But call price actually stayed relatively stable at around 75-85 cents. Almost no calls were being bought or sold for less than 75 cents when they should have dropped to around 60-65 cents. Open interest at this time was a little over 9000.

-

This to me is a really strong signal that big players are putting a lot of promise into this company for the upcoming earnings report. No one was willing to openly sell OTM covered calls for a huge premium, even though there were plenty of buyers at a comparatively high price (compared to the large volume of trades throughout the past few weeks). For example, the ideal gain on 65 cent September $15.00 strike calls would have been around 10.99% during yesterday's crash. That's an almost 11% profit in 9 days^[1], while also hedging for a drop on underlying shares -- against what is most likely the company's short-term theoretical floor. TLRD's lowest closing price as of this year is $11.23, which happened in June during the general market crash. 

-

TLRD is currently around $13.75, down from around $15.10 as of their 5-day high. Sep16 $15.00 strike calls are going for around 65 cents each (on low daily volume) at the current share price. With execution on catalyst date, this transaction would profit 13.82% in 8 days. 

-

I highly doubt TLRD will crash below $13 for long periods unless they drop an absolute bomb in their report. They would have hinted towards this in their previous quarterly report, but it's also possible that projected growth ends up being unfavorable. TLRD has been making great business decisions lately, and a negative change in management policy would most likely be the worst possible news. Proceed at your own risk and hedge any unusually risky plays. If you buy shares, you won't be down nearly as much money if this prediction is incorrect. TLRD is still a giant and unlikely to go out of business anytime soon. 

-

[1] Expiration date for these calls is September 16th, but with the biggest (and most likely only) catalyst being TLRD's next earnings report, we can consider September 7th to be our realistic expiration date.

I started selling $55 $EFA Puts at the beginning of the year. This was to lock in my IRA contribution at $5,500. I made a few dollars doing this.

Then I bought some and sold some calls on lots of stuff, but mostly $EFA.

I YOLO'd the Brexit, took some profits the night before and sold some calls, just in case. That is where the first big gains come from. The losses through July were the closing out of the rest of the trades.

The next big leg up is $RLYP. I heard about this stock here. I Bought 600 shares and sold 6 DITM LEAPS. Lots of downside protection and a $3,000 gain if the stock moved quickly up. I ended up closing the calls when the stock dropped for about $500. Then I went out of town, forgot to sell the stock, and got lucky with the buyout at $32. The net gain was about $7,000.

There is one red line in August. This is where that guy said, ""You have x minutes to sell $YUM"". I bought some puts. People apparently like Taco Bell more than that guy thought.

The rest of the trades were $SRPT. I sold puts at nearly every OTM liquid strike there was. I have posted elsewhere here about those trades. At the apex, I was obligated to buy nearly $100,000 of $SRPT. However, OTM put selling high volatility stock meant that a drop of about 60% would have had to happen before I was looking at losses.

I bought to close the higher strikes on days where the stock gapped up. I then sold more at lower strikes to ""remove risk"". For example, if I had sold 10 puts at $16 strike, I'd buy to close and then sell between 15 and 20 $8 strike puts. This takes the risk from $16,000 to between $16,000 (20) and $12,000 (15). However, the strike is 50% further away. 

[StockOptionChannel.com](https://www.stockoptionschannel.com/) has some great free resources to look at the ROI for cash covered puts.

I got tired of waiting on a decision for $SRPT, so I closed all of the positions over the last week.

I have replaced that position by selling the Sept 16 $40 puts on $AGM. It's no moon rocket, but pays a fat dividend that goes ex-dividend on the 15th. I sold the puts for between $1.10 and $1.15. I'd be happy to own the stock at $38.90 collecting a $1.04 dividend per year with a dividend growth rate of 14%. I'd sell calls against this stock if I was put the stock.

Everything else is in the portfolio is indexed about 50/50 between $EFA and S&amp;P500.

16-08-26,4zqo80,Why you SHOULD NEVER use Questrade.,"I find there to be a lack of direction and guidance when it comes to choosing a broker, if you ask 10 people, you'll get 8 different responses, and none of them have sufficient reasoning to 'recommend' one over another. I'm not here to tell you which one to pick, instead I'm here to tell you which one NOT to pick, which is the son of satan, Questrade.

Through dozens of errors (on their end), site glitches and malfunctions, complete site overhaul, poor navigation on their site and even them accusing me of not being me... I can 100% say **DO NOT CHOOSE QUESTRADE**.

**I should also mention, I am in Canada so my options are VERY limited**

I'm not going to give you a super bias review, so let me start with what they do right (since this list will be short):

You can start a registered TFSA with them with almost no money (I did 400 originally).

**And now for the bad:**

- **Commission:** They charge an absolutely RIDICULOUS amount of commission, 1 cent per trade MINIMUM $5 though, maximum $10. They know  rich people don't use their site, they know you'll always reach the limit. **And they charge commission on BUYING AND SELLING**... Yes, on 1000 shares that comes out to a total of $20 in commission, REGARDLESS of how much they cost.

- **Site Navigation:** The site is like a corn-maze trying to figure out what does what, there are *hundreds* of buttons, half of them do the same thing but have different names. The site looks completely different in half-screen mode compared to full-screen. They changed the site layout TWICE in the first 3 weeks I started using it. The site relies heavily on hidden-drawers so you have no clue where any button even is.

- **Customer Service:** Strangely enough, this is what originally attracted me to Questrade, they have a Reddit customer serviceman who was somewhat easily reachable, this convinced me that they must have a good customer service department if they have a reddit rep... well, I was wrong. My account was flagged and frozen because *one of their reps* stopped responding to me the SECOND the clock hit 4:30, with NO FOREWARNING. Yes, you read that right, they thought I was suspicious for waiting for a response after being ditched mid-way through discussing opening an account. After calling them to sort things out, they refused to believe my account e-mail was mine simply because it didn't have my name in it.

- **They've left me stranded... multiple times:** As you could have guessed from the only positive thing I have to say about this site, I don't have a ton of cash to throw around, and so every once in a while I need to withdraw my winnings... but this has never happened without an issue. First off, I set up everything that it told me to setup to accept withdrawals, I then checked with a rep to make sure there wouldn't be an issue since I was going out of the country and needed this money to withdraw, he confirmed there was no issue, I send a withdrawal request and 4 hours later after I've left the country, I get an e-mail notifying me that there was an error processing my request and it could not be completed. They did NOT tell at any point that I needed a Direct Deposit Form, VERY VERY luckily, I had it on me and was able to upload it and re-request the withdrawal which ended up costing me $20 because they didn't send the EFT in the time they said they would. Setting up the account took about a week despite only needing a day tops because they do not tell you what information you need ahead of time, instead they tell you what you need for each step then wait till you're at the next step to tell you further instructions, this costed me 5 trips to the bank when it could have only been 1.
They also left all of my personal info in an unclosed chat box since they ditched me mid conversation.

- **Reaching anyone who works there is terribly difficult... they're only open strictly between trading hours, and often times, they don't even respond:** The amount of times they've done something to my account that needed assistance when assistance wasn't available is endless... It's like I'm holding their hands telling them how to do my banking when I just want to be left alone - hence SELF-DIRECTED account.

**Finally to summarise:** Questrade is far from ready... like *very* far, it feels like I'm using a site that shouldn't even have an Alpha or Beta let alone full-release, there isn't any good side to them anymore, making money off of them is terribly difficult and what I do make feels like it's constantly taken away from their ginormous commission. I *highly* recommend not using Questrade in *any* circumstance, even if it's your only option, it just isn't worth the trouble, save up a few extra hundred bucks and meet the $3k minimum Interactive Brokers minimum requirement. I'm not a little kid Questrade, I want hassle free trading and for you to just DO what you said you would and do it properly, my financials are not for some petty site to play with as if they're a joke.

**EDIT: If you have any questions on any part of any process, let me know and I can further explain. If I'm going to give a negative review, I want to do it fairly and not bluntly make accusations without proof.",3

16-08-28,4zzkwf,Biggest companies buying their own share and inflating share price.,"What do you think about the following theory:

1) Big companies like Apple, Microsoft, Google have a ton of money. They have more money that they are able to invest in their projects. They have billions stashed away doing nothing.

2) They spend that money by buying their own stock.

3) This inflates the stock price and it keeps going up.

4) Investors think that it is great, S&amp;P500 grows and keep investing.

Do you think this is true?

For the full article please follow the link above. 

&gt; Brussels is poised to hand down an adverse ruling against Ireland after a three-year inquiry into claims the country granted an illegal tax arrangement to Apple, the world’s biggest tech company.

&gt; Apple could be on the hook to pay billions of dollars in back taxes to Ireland in light of the finding that tax rulings conferred illegal state aid to Apple by granting it an advantage not made available to other companies.

&gt; There is some uncertainty as to whether a precise penalty will be defined in the ruling. Analysts at JPMorgan have said Apple’s potential liability, in a worst-case scenario, could be up to €19bn. In other assessments, however, the liability may come in at around $1bn.

I'm doing a school project which requires me building a trading platform for  a trader. One of the requirements is implementing risk management.

98% institutionally owned making it a very safe bet as well as them giving a 1% or so dividend. Price to sales is 0.88 making the stock undervalued, and the company is liquid so no worries there.


Has beaten earnings the last two quarters, and 3 out of the last 4 quarters while reacting positive to most of them.

For you technical analysis boys, just look at the chart the fast moving average has just passed the slow into an uptrend. Volume has also been on an uptrend and you know what they say about volume- it precedes the price meaning there's still room to increase.

Presentation is: Tuesday, August 30, 10:19 a.m. CEST

Phase 2 study of A797, an oral, selective p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor, in patients with lamin A/C-related dilated cardiomyopathy 


A/C related dialated cardiomyopathy is a pretty rare disease with no other indicated treatments.  

Here is the abstract for the study:   http://spo.escardio.org/SessionDetails.aspx?eevtid=1127&amp;sessId=18929&amp;subSessId=0&amp;searchQuery=%2fdefault.aspx%3feevtid%3d1127%26days%3d30%252f08%252f2016%26topics%3d%26types%3d%26rooms%3d%26freetext%3d797%26sort%3d1%26page%3d1%26showResults%3dTrue%26nbPerPage%3d20%26WithWebcast%3d%26WithSlides%3d%26WithAbstract%3d%26WithReport%3d%26scroll%3D0#.V8Q8N00rLq5


It is the 3rd one down on the page.  


methodology and data looks good, there are a few patients not yet reported, most likely because they are still in treatment.  Though the abstract is/has been available online, I believe that the presentation will drive volume and result in a price bump, especially with the strong data.  There are several other upcoming catalytsts as well.

I am quite confused.,"I've been looking to invest in individual bonds through IB (which I use for all my investments) but I am quite confused by the appellations. I called their customer service and their reply was - I am not kidding - ""not many people use us to buy bonds so we don't know how it all works"". Thanks guys!

So if one of you kind souls is familiar with all this, it'd be great if you could enlighten me. More specifically, if you look at [this screenshot of the details of a $GSK bond](http://i.imgur.com/6dhof21.png):

- It says that the face value is $1000 and the coupon $2.85 paid semi-annually. Am I to believe that the principal of the bond is therefore $1000 and that this will be reimbursed to the bond holder on the bond termination date, in that case 8th of May 2022? 
- Also does it mean that until the 8th of May 2022 the bond holder is paid $2.85 every 6 months? That would mean that the interest rate is a ridiculously low 0.57% which I'd imagine is not quite possible hence my confusion...

And if you look at [this other screenshot for the same bond](http://i.imgur.com/HJJSHtd.png):

- It says that the current ask price is $105.28 and that this means a yield of 1.865%. How is that yield calculated? Because if one divides the annual coupon (2 * $2.85 = $5.7) by the ask price ($105.28), one gets 5.41%...
- Also if the current ask price is $105.28 and the face value if $1000 as assessed above, am I to believe that I buy something for $105.28 today that will get me $2.85 every 6 months until the 8th of May 2022, date I which I'll receive the $1000 principal back?

Thank you so much in advance!

16-08-29,5057kn,ELTP Announces Development and License Agreement with SunGen Pharma LLC," 	

Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (""Elite"" or the “Company"") (OTCBB:ELTP), a specialty pharmaceutical company developing abuse-deterrent opioids and niche generic products, today announced it has entered into a Development and License Agreement (“Agreement”) with SunGen Pharma, LLC (“SunGen”) to collaborate to develop and commercialize four generic pharmaceutical products.

Under the terms of the agreement, Elite and SunGen will share in the responsibilities and costs in the development of the products. Upon approval, the products will be owned jointly by Elite and SunGen. SunGen shall have the exclusive right to market and sell two of the products using SunGen’s label and Elite shall have the exclusive right to market and sell two of the products using Elite’s label. Elite will manufacture and package all four products on a cost plus basis.

Two of the products are classified as CNS stimulants and two of the products are classified as beta blockers. For the twelve months ending June 30, 2016, the four products and their generic equivalents had total U.S. sales of more than $3 billion according to IMS Health Data.

“We are excited to collaborate with SunGen on the development of these four important generic products,” said Nasrat Hakim, Chairman and CEO of Elite.

“We are thrilled to have this long term strategic partnership with Elite and collaborate in a broad range of product portfolio in development, manufacturing and marketing,” said Dr. Jim Huang, CEO of SunGen.

About Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company which is developing a pipeline of proprietary pharmacological abuse-deterrent opioid products as well as niche generic products. Elite specializes in oral sustained and controlled release drug products which have high barriers to entry.

Elite currently has eight commercial products being sold, additional approved products pending manufacturing site transfer and the NDA for SequestOx™, for which it just received the CRL from the FDA.

16-08-28,501zsj,"Play on $SRPT I'm thinking about, really risky with a 5% upside immediately","Sarepta Therapeutics Inc has a 126% IV right now. If you bought 100 share at $26.76 it comes out to $2676. You then turn around and sell a covered call for $150 (September 2nd $27.50 strike price). Lets say selling 1 call costs you $8. So you get $142 the next day.

142 divided by 2678 = 0.053 times 100 = 5.3% returns for holding SRPT for a week.

Let's say that you get assigned, then you come out with a $72 gain (a $.72 gain times 100 shares = $72) on top of your $142.

Now you have a $214 gain. 214 divided by 2678 = 0.079 times 100 = a 7.9% gain in a week. 

The stock could drop or do anything so use your caution if you decide to make this play.

TLDR: Buy 100 shares of SRPT, sell 1 covered Sep 2nd call with a strike of $27.50 and come out with a 5% gain. If the option goes ITM, then you get a 7.9% gain.",1

Ticker: SIMO (NASDAQ)

Company: Silicon Motion Technology Corp.

Shares closed at $50.62 on Friday

$SIMO short term projected share growth is at least 20%

Projected revenue growth over 3 years is 77%

Management team average tenure is about 10 years, so they'll be making long term decisions

Makes RF circuits for internet-enabled devices (more phones/tablets = ⬆️)

Rated a strong buy by a myriad of firms

Recent temporary dip (good entry point)

Has outperformed the average tech sector by over 40%

Is a competitor of Qualcomm and is catching up

Company has no debt

Nice insider buying from stuff like Hatteras Funds and Blue Rock Advisors (negligible selling)

Reporting earnings sometime in mid sept and has only disappointed earnings once in the past 2 years

It's forming a cup and handle pattern...try timing it with that

And although it hardly counts, it has a 100% bullish sentiment on stocktwits

Drawbacks:

High beta value of 1.16 (volatile...dropped like 10% in less than a week once)

Low dividend (1.19%) but will probably rise to 1.78%

Relatively new CEO (may be a good thing though ¯_(ツ)_/¯ )

TA patterns show that if the 25 SMA just breezes by the 50 SMA (and doesn't cross) AMD is in for gains on the day. This is further supported by the fact that the 100 SMA is moving to it's place ABOVE the 200 SMA.

[Buy in now boys before lunch is over!!](http://imgur.com/a/ABvFv)

The lines in the picture are as follows over a 3 day period:

-Teal: 25 SMA

-Green: 50 SMA

-Orange: 100 SMA

-Blue: 200 SMA

-Purple: 300 SMA

Disclaimer: TA is mostly bullshit (especially mine) and never right, but you should buy $AMD anyway.

EDIT: This is great. Taking a second look a ""pop"" really wasn't in order, but that's the pattern AMD followed the last couple times the 25 SMA grazed the 50 SMA as it did this morning.

If anything it's consolidating as the 100 SMA moves into position above the 200 and 300. The end of the week should be interesting.

This index boasts some rather eye-catching returns, having a 16.37% average return since its inception, and a 20.64% 5 year-to-date average return. As a result of these significant returns, I am heavily considering buying in with a large amount of my current savings (I have just turned 18, and as a result would like to ""start the ball rolling"" with my savings - I have $2000 disposable income currently, still living at home, about to enter first year university and have just landed a job which should earn me $6,000 or so minimum next year in casual work). Also, it should be noted that this will be my first investment.

My question is this: are the returns listed by this index ""believable""? It seems significantly higher than the long-term market average of 7% - it almost seems ""too good to be true"" (the compound interest potential of 20%+ p.a seems ridiculous to me). Is there any ""due diligence"" I could conduct to make sure that somehow Vanguard isn't operating some form of scam here? I know it sounds silly, considering Vanguard's reputation and all, I just want to make sure I'm not going to bomb out on my first ever investment. 

Are there any redditors currently invested in this ETF? If so, how has your portfolio fared as a result?

[Second Update - 8/29/201] (http://i.imgur.com/aBcgTUJ.jpg)


I still have about a month to hit that full year but here is my second update of my outcome so far : 

At this point, I feel kind of regretful that I missed a chance to nearly double my $5000 emergency fund sitting on my savings but yeah...who would have ever known that I was able to do this well (still a chance that I would have lost them all!)


I'm just glad that I didn't lose anything and as for percentage wise, I think I've managed to do pretty well for a beginner.


As for an update from the previous post, I sold all my ATVI shares and reinvested em to other companies that I've already owned.


Hope this works out well (so far it did!) and if you have any questions, ask me anything! (Though I'm not by any means an expert in trading at all.)


I, myself, have also asked numerous questions to be familiar with trading. So ask away! :)",43

16-08-30,50a0is,"Fed Funds Futures &amp; Implied Probability of Feds Fund Rate and how you'll profit or get screwed","I just learned (more like extrapolated) this one due to being extremely curious and frustrated with what happened on Friday (8/26).  All the news was talking about how the implied probability of a feds fund rate going from XX% to a **higher** XX%, watching the market **drop** due to it, and I'm like ""how the hell did they come up with that"".  Well this is how:

You take any futures contract from ""30-Day Fed Funds Futures Prices"" which can be tracked by looking up the futures contracts that begin with ZQ, in this case we'll use September's:

ZQU16 99.5825 (as of 2/30 pre market)

You minus 100 then times 100 and get a % (or do it in your head).  So this implies that a September rate hike is 41.75% probable, down from 42.5% where ZQU16 was 99.575 on 8/26 [(100 - 99.575)*100=42.5].

Before Fed's speech on 8/26, ZQU16 jumped to 99.59 implying 41% probability of a hike, and we saw the market (s&amp;p) go up, but at the end of the speech, shit hit the fan and it fell down to  99.575 &amp; 42.5%.

Some news sites will use a different month of ZQ like Oct or Dec or even calculate the probability in a different way.  **Watching Oct's futures on 8/26 we saw it move from 43.5% to 48.5%.**

Since this rate matters so much to the market's overall price movement, I'm now watching these tickers for sep, oct, nov, &amp; dec in order:

ZQU16

ZQV16

ZQX16

ZQZ16


Currently and based on Nov's futures, about 0.01% (0.01 points) move in ZQ translates to 0.25% move in S&amp;P.  I don't think that'll always hold true, but it's been true for 8/26 and 8/29.",6

Point (ii) is likely to deter most investors from timing the market. But: could a case be made for particularly young people? We don't stand to lose **that** much from 2-3 bull years, and it's doubtful the S&amp;P will keep climbing for 3 more years, as it has gone from 676.53 on March, 2009 to a whooping 2176.12 as of today!!!

16-08-30,50e5wt,$X The Bearish outlook.,"TLDR; Do not buy into the steel industry into the economy decides what the fuck it wants to do.

I am bearish on the steel industry and especially X. I look at this stock from a macro view and do not even get into the numbers and where I think a good price to purchase or short would be. 

The steel business is highly cyclical in my opinion and I think we may be reaching the top of our cycle and are in for a dry spell.

The price of steel as illustrated below is recovering from very low levels. The economy was steadily growing, so why did the steel market drop off suddenly? The primary driver of the price of steel was the influx of foreign importation of steel. (Source 1) When the Chinese economy began to slow down, China (state-funded) steel producers began to export millions of tons of steel into foreign economies at cheaper prices than their own domestic products could produce. (Side story: China, like many foreign economies used to produce garbage steel prior to their growth in their economy. Then companies in America started to expand into these global markets, creating brand new state of the art facilities that rival and better most of the steel mill’s back home. So in a sense, we played ourselves.) With the new duties increased “five-fold” whatever the fuck that means, the price of steel slowly began to go up. Other factors that caused this was the idling of many United States facilities. This is where USS pivoted very well. They began a mass layoff of high-wage unionized workers, and started to bring facilities to 100+ percent capacity rather than having multiple facilities fully staffed at 70% percent capacity. When the price of steel dropped, demand went up, thus creating the spike in the price with a nice additional bump from imported steel tariffs. If you whole-heartedly believe demand will not fallout over the next 6 months than go ahead and invest into X.

http://imgur.com/a/6PHX4

	So you read above and you think to yourself, why be this moron bearish on X? The price of steel has gone up, capacity at X is filled, and there should be fewer imports to worry about.
	Reason numero uno. The steel industry is cyclical and we had a huge bull run for about 8 months. The price of steel sky-rocketed to manageable levels.

Short term I see the price of steel decreasing 20-30 percent where it will rest for a while waiting on the US economy to decide what to do. And with that, the price of X will drop into the low teens in January/February time frame.

	Reason number two as to why I wouldn’t invest in X. Point blank, this not a moon shot type of stock, chances are if you think it is going to be on a bull run, you can see a few days of green and a down day prior to getting in. Their dividend history is absolute garbage and I’m not even sure why they still pay one out. In reality it is probably to appease a large shareholder or something.
 
	So you have gotten this far and you still want to invest into X. The second factor that I would like to point out to show that the price of steel will inevitably go down is the price of Iron Ore. In the chart below, you’ll see that when compared to the price of steel chart that correlate. As the price of Iron Ore goes up, so does the price of steel. Iron Ore pricing will increase or stay the same as the price of steel decreases. (Source 3) S&amp;P upgraded its forecast for Iron Ore and it seems like pricing will stay relatively flat for the foreseeable future. As pricing stays neutral and the price of steel dips off, X will see decreased margins.

The last thing I would like to bring up is the fact that X's biggest competitor in the U.S. is a company called Nucor. They are a mini-mill, meaning they do not use earthly elements to produce steel. They basically just melt down scrap. The price of scrap will stay deflated well beyond this bull run of steel because of the world market being slow. As steel mill's slow down capacity and the economy slows, there will be glut of steel leftover in warehouses. What happens to steel when it sits a dark damp environment, it rusts and ultimately gets scrapped. Just some food for thought.

16-08-30,50e91a,Why MNRO is going to go shoot up in the next few months,"MNRO took a dip into the mid 50's on august 5th, making it the perfect time to buy. Here is why I think MNRO will hit at least $70 within a few months. This is just my opinion, don't base your decisions on this post. Do your own research and decide if this investment is for you.
 
Reasons:

MNRO is estimated to have higher earnings for q3 2016 than they did for q3 2015. A buildup started last year in the low 60's just a month before their earnings were released. A month after their q3 earnings were released last year, their stock price hit 77. Now lets just think about this. If they are estimated to make higher earnings this quarter than they had in 2015, how much higher will the stock go? Will it break 80 after the q3 earnings are released? Nothing major has changed in this company's business model or fundamentals within the course of a year. For the people who will say, ""What if MNRO misses their earnings?"". It's possible, but MNRO rarely misses their earnings, and when they do, it's only by a small amount. 

On to my next reason why right now is a great time to buy MNRO. Its current price is less than a dollar above its 52 week low. The price just dipped a large amount

MNRO isn't going anywhere. They're a big name in the auto business, and they've been around forever. The worst that could happen is the stock price doesn't go up after their earnings, and you have to wait until the stock is profitable to sell again.

There are many other reasons to buy this stock right now, but I'm not going to go into detail unless somebody requests it. I know a lot of members of this subreddit don't like lengthy write ups. Overall, I think MNRO is a great short term and long term investment

16-08-31,50eclt,What is the business model of the binary options trading websites?,"(I am not going to name any websites throughout the post to avoid making this look like an anti-/advertisement.)

To give a bit of context:

About a month ago I have discovered binary trading. I have traded for a while using test account. Was doing great. Then deposited USD 2000.00. Long story short, at a peak I got to 9k+ and then lost everything. This all happened in a window of couple of hours.

USD 2k is not necessarily a big amount of money to me, but the opportunity of ""fast money"" got stuck in my head.

Fast forward to today. (I am a programmer.) I have created a service that logs all data that a particular binary trading platform broadcasts. I have used over a month's worth of data to run various algorithms to simulate trading. No rocket science: SMA, EMA, Bollinger Bands, etc. metrics (I have worked in a IB, though my knowledge is limited). Long story short, today the algorithm is trading at a 66% success rate (or over 80% success rate if using short-selling) [in this particular dataset]. In theory, I should be making a profit of ~5% a day (the commission charges vary quite a lot throughout the day).

I know, ""Past performance is no guarantee of future results."" 

Regardless, I am considering to give this trading a second chance. First with a low amount of money (thinking about another USD 2000.00) and then see where things go.

Naturally, I am researching legitimacy of my plan. There are a few reddit posts on the subject:

* https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/391z63/binary_options_has_anyone_had_any_experience_or/
* https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/2v2oge/my_experience_with_binary_options_what_you_should/
* https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/2afqa5/are_binary_options_a_scam_can_you_make_any_money/

but none provide basic evidence to either legitimate or scam nature of the binary options trading.

I'd like to have a basic understanding of:

* Is the data thats provided by the binary trading option representative of the real market?, i.e. is there any way that the platform could influence the outcome of the bid, other than by delaying to accept the bid?
* If I ""win"" a bid, does this effectively mean that the binary trading platform is losing money on that bid?

Any additional insights are most welcome.

Thank you",3

Phase 2 showed statistically significant benefits witha p value of .041. That was 1600 patients. The phase 3 study has 11,000 patients so if this vaccine works, they should see it with the number of patients they have.

The problem is, there are a ton of shorts on this stock right now with 62.5 million shares short. Meaning a lot of people are betting that it's going to fail.

So if phase 3 results don't look great, it's going to drop... a lot.

If the results are good, it's going to skyrocket and continue to go up as the shorts cover for an epic short squeeze. 

I'm in for 500 shares right now and January calls at a $10 strike price. This is a high risk, high reward play and the question is whether or not to hold through results or ride it up as it goes through september(if it goes up) and sell before results. The other thing to consider is that if they have good results, they are a huge buyout target for some of the big pharma companies as this could be a multi-billion dollar per year vaccine.

1. [Baltic Dirty Tanker Index](http://www.lloydslistintelligence.com/llint/tankers/baltic-index.htm) which tracks oil shipping rates is at a historic low

2. Oil depots are full, meaning a rise in oil price will lead to a decrease in demand as stores are depleted.

3. An oversupply in tankers. Can't find the data right now but there is quiet some capacity entering the market.

On the other hand Oil consumption is higher than ever and won't go anywhere soon.

I have an opportunity to invest in a company that makes self help video products that are released on the internet and the owner of the company wants a sum of money in order to launch a new product.  The agreement is the product will be developed and launched and then the money will be returned to me with interest.

The thing I would like to know is if there is any way to protect myself from being completely scammed by this.  Lets say the guy makes back the money and then some, is it possible that he could just never send me back my initial investment let alone extra?  What are some legal actions I could take if that happens?  What are some things I could do in the initial part in order to ensure that I am not going to get scammed like this?

By the way I trust the guy and I understand that if the product doesn't make money I could lose my money etc etc. I am not worried about that.  What can I do to insure myself against getting robbed?  Obviously I will be consulting a lawyer about this, but I was just wondering if anyone here had some information for me.

This company is completely lost and their UIT performance has been as awful now as it was great in 2013 and 2014.  The Chairman has been exposed for prior SEC violations and the returns are downright awful.  Check this out:
Bakers Dozen August 2015   -11.89% v benchmark +7.08%
Bakers Dozen 2016  +4.11% v benchmark +17.57%
Defensive Equity 4    -.65% v benchmark +8.7%
Defensive Equity 5   -4.32 v benchmark +15.23%
Defensive Equity 6  +1.41% v benchmark +7.21%
Defensive Equity 7  +1.39% v benchmark +7.28%
Forward Looking Value 3  -14.98% v benchmark  +5.18%
Rising Rate 1  -10.49% v benchmark +6.07%
Rising Rate 2  -3.17% v benchmark  +12.06%
Rising Rate 3  -7.97% v benchmark +6.13%
Rising Rate 4  +15.41% v benchmark +13.34%
Small Cap Growth 10  +3.47 v benchmark +8.39%
Small Cap Growth 7  -3.85% v benchmark +5.09%
Small Cap Growth 8  +7.28% v benchmark +7.38%
Small Cap Growth 9  +30.37% v benchmark +22.82%
Weak Treasury 5  +6.31% v benchmark 12.92%
Dividend 7  +2.89% v benchmark +14.54%
Dividend 8  -.25% v benchmark +8.74%
Dividend 9  -2.85% v benchmark +6.86%
Dividend 10  -6.48% v benchmark +7.36%
Dividend 11  +2.17% v benchmark +13.53%
Dividend 12  +6.27% v benchmark +10.04%
Dividend 13  +8.6% v benchmark +10.05%

So, this is without the management fee which runs about 2.5% so only ONE UIT is above the benchmark and most are significantly below.  Scott Martindale is one of the sales guys I used to see a lot, appears he is now President, and he always showed a website called Dark Liquidity.  http://dark-liquidity.com/StockPicksSummary.php

In 2013 and 2014 Sabrient was at or near the top.  2015 and 2016 they have languished in the middle or lower.  As you can see they are #30.  They also published their list when the market was already -6% for the year so if you adjust for that they are literally 4 from the bottom.  Interestingly, I looked into the #1 portfolio and after visiting the Vickery website discovered that this is the former President/CEO of Sabrient and Director of Research who left Sabrient in 2014!  Seems they took the returns with them.

Anyone have any further information on Sabrient?  I am 90% sure I won't purchase Baker's Dozen 2017 but am always open to have my mind changed if there is new information.

Pros:
1. Walgreens anticipates that its merger with Rite Aid will bring savings of nearly $1 billion from cost overlay a year after completion of its deal.
Comments: They’re proving their market structure is efficient
2. Though it looks as if the target is little ambitious, but it is achievable as after Walgreens acquired Alliance Boots, the company saved $799 million in last fiscal year.
Comments: Good track record of doing honest business: Set a good example with the FTC then, may have ‘special relationship’
3. WBAs ability to grow revenue as well as profits; oppositely, RAD is growing revenue and lowering profits (death spiral) 
Comments: RAD is simply getting squeezed out by WBA/CVS who are many times bigger and more profitable. FTC may go ahead and save RAD its eventual death. (See RAD stock and earnings performance)  
4. Walgreens will revamp RAD stores 
5. FTC conditions via negotiations could help boost the likelihood of a merger
Based off rumors, seems legit tho; talk about plans to close Walgreens stores in Denver, CO. CVS has no presences there, plan would be to sell RAD stores to CVS (spin off assets, generate cash)   
6. PBMs supported this merger
Comments: Support came from small players
7. Walgreens is expected to close a lot less stores than originally thought http://www.businessfinancenews.com/29270-ftc-might-reject-walgreens-bootsrite-aid-merger-heres-why/

Cons:
1.The FTC’s major concern with respect to this deal is that the merger between the two drug stores will provide too much power to the combined entity that it will have an upper hand when negotiating prices with drug manufacturers and with pharmacies benefit managers. (monopoly) 
Comments: See Maps
2. WBA could capitalize on lowering pharmacy salaries because they’re one of two players hiring pharmacists 
Comments: Not sure if this is relevant to FTC

In their conference call however, they mentioned that the earthquake in Japan would slow their Q2 and Q3 revenues, since Sony had partially shut down their plant for producing sensors.  They mentioned weakness in the wearables sector.

It seems to me that AMBA is priced for a blow-out quarter when they all but said in the Q1 call that this quarter will disappoint.

I like Bank of America (BAC).  While it has gone on a nice run lately, it only trades at 12.7 forward PE while the Russell 1000 (broader market measure than S&amp;P) trades at 19.7, showing a significant discount to market.  Broadly in line with other banks.  The company is close to making Warren Buffet convert his preferred stock to common and thus reduce the companies financing costs.  BAC should also benefit from rising rates.  With 1yr forward estimates of 1.27 in earnings and .3 in dividends, the company has a lot of room to push up its payout ratio.  Assuming a .5 payout ratio, that's .635 per year in divs, which is a 4% yield. While the yield is currently low, I expect it to grow over the next two years as both earnings and thr payout ratio increase.  I can see this at a 6-10% yield at cost in a few years.",1

However, that changed Friday and I believe Fischer was tasked with preparing the market for what would be a Sept rate hike. The events of this week have only supported these thoughts.

So at this point I'm looking forward to Friday at 8:30, in the case of negative employment report how high can Gold/NUGT go? In the opposite scenario, DUST becomes a must hold until the rate hike decision.",2

16-08-31,50htog,TCPI - dumpster fire or undervalued?,"TCPI is a lighting company that I first bought shares of when I knew even less than I do now. Shortly thereafter, the company was embroiled in scandal when its CEO was sued by the company's General Council over harassment. There's been some more scandals since then, including some allegations of financial misconduct, so things haven't been going great. In fact, the company hasn't provided earnings reports for the last several quarters because of an ongoing investigation into some shady payments the ex-CEO made after he got booted to being Chairman.

So, in summary, the former CEO is probably a dirtbag egomaniac (he might fit in well here) who may or may not have been playing fast and loose with company money, the exact financial health/fraud level is unknown, there's some other claims against the product quality, and its a couple months away from the threat of delisting thanks to the lack of earnings reports. Sounds real bad.

But here's what I wonder...the company has been around for a couple decades (privately held) and was doing just fine business wise before all the scandal. The products are still in Home Depot, Walmart and other retailers, presumably selling just as well as before (because why would Joe Consumer care about any of this stock stuff?), and the rest of the business to all appearances seems to have been ticking along behind the scenes. So, once all the dust settles from the scandals (which admittedly could continue for a long while), what will stop TCP from getting back to business? Or, getting bought out by somebody else?

TLDR: I'm making a paper thin argument for why I should average down. YOLO another $500",1

I know that if a company goes bankrupt, you probably will lose all your stocks if you don't have any kinds of safety stuff.

But say if you own 1000 dollars in stocks, and the stock price fall 10%. Then you will own 900 dollars in stocks. But it goes back up 10% will you then own 1000 dollar again, or 10% of 900 dollar? Which is 990.

Another question, is there more ways to lose money in stocks?

If you have any recommendations about books, sites for information about stocks market ect ect or other useful beginner stuff I would appreciate it if you post it here :)
Thanks!

16-08-31,50iun1,[NEWS] Elon Musk may have accidentally leaked insider information.,"Musk Talked Merger With SolarCity CEO Before Tesla Stock Sale Carmaker chief discussed ‘conceptual’ benefits with cousin Board at first rejected idea amid SUV manufacturing challenges

By David Welch and Dana Hull
----

(Bloomberg) -- 
It was in February when Elon Musk suggested to his cousin that they merge the companies they run, Tesla Motors Inc. and SolarCity Corp. -- three months before the electric-car maker sold $1.4 billion in stock in a secondary offering and four months before Musk made a marriage proposal public. 

Musk, Tesla’s chief executive officer and SolarCity’s chairman and largest shareholder, had the discussion with his cousin, SolarCity CEO Lyndon Rive, sometime before Feb. 29 when Tesla’s board was briefed on the idea, which it turned down at the time, according to a document filed Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

***That means that Musk and Tesla’s board had considered a merger with SolarCity before its May stock offering without disclosing it to potential buyers of the new shares.*** The merger has been controversial among Tesla shareholders, some of whom have opposed the deal and sold the stock when it was announced in June. Tesla shares fell more than 10 percent on June 22, the first trading day after the merger proposal was announced. The company declined to comment beyond the filing.

Some shareholders and analysts have questioned the deal because Musk owns more than 20 percent of each company. SolarCity has struggled financially and some analysts have said that its cash burn could be a problem for Tesla, which also needs money to develop new cars like the Model 3 sedan, which is supposed to begin full production in mid-2017. Tesla in the filing reiterated plans to raise more capital this year.

‘High-Level’ Conversation

Musk has expressed interest in solar energy as part of Tesla’s vision in the past. His 2006 master plan for the carmaker said it aimed to “expedite the world’s move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy.” It also included plans to co-market solar panels from SolarCity.

The February discussion between Musk and Lyndon Rive was described in documents as “high-level, conceptual,” with the two CEOs talking about possible product offerings from the combined company. The filing doesn’t specify if the conversation was before or after Musk’s Feb. 12 purchase of almost 570,000 shares of SolarCity for an average price of about $17.56 apiece, which brought his holdings to about 21.8 million shares.

The idea got more serious at the special meeting of Tesla’s board on Feb. 29, when Wheeler presented to directors “preliminary considerations related to product and operational synergies” that could come from a merger, which directors put off at the time.

Tesla’s board took the possible deal more seriously on May 31 -- just 13 days after the secondary stock offering was announced -- when it directed management to assess a potential solar acquisition. The board requested “the strategic rationale of an acquisition of SolarCity or other potential acquisition targets in the solar-energy industry” as well as a financial analysis of such a deal.

In the same meeting, the board told management to use law firm Wachtell,
Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz as special outside counsel for legal analysis relating to a potential transaction. Evercore Partners was brought in as a financial adviser.

The documents also show that SolarCity had two inquiries from two possible partners in June, but neither of the unnamed parties made an offer.

Any thoughts on fits or are there any better ETFs to look into that bet on fitness / health primarily?

16-08-31,50j86a,Moving from Scott Trade to Vanguard vs Investing in Vanguard ETFs at Scott Trade,"Through a custodial transfer, I have 2 scott trade accounts. One is a ROTH IRA, the other is just a taxable account. They're both invested in some companies I don't pay attention to really, and basically have not gained any money in the past few years.

I was thinking about transferring my money to vanguard instead because I already have a ROTH IRA and taxable account at Vanguard. However, at least for the ROTH transfer, I was told scott trade charges $75. I have a total of 450 in my ROTH IRA at scott trade, so this 75 is about 17% of my entire ROTH there.

I was looking into just buying VTI with my scott trade money instead and just letting it sit, but since I never check scott trade, I'm not sure how the fees work if I buy a vanguard fund through another broker. Would it make more sense to just do the one time transfer to suck up the fees, or to just let it sit in scott trade and buy VTI or another vanguard ETF?

If I moved it into vanguard, I would most likely put it into my VTSAX fund so the ERs are the same.",1
