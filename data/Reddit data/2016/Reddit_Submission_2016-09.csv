# We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations or meet our working capital requirements.

Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will depend on our financial and operating performance, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds, including under our secured revolving line of credit for a principal amount up to $500 million (our Secured Revolving Line of Credit), in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to meet our working capital requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt, we may be required to sell assets or equity, reduce expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt, sell assets or equity, borrow funds under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit or borrow more funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all.

# If we cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments.

Our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient revenue and cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. Our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline.

We regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity financing. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. The health of the credit markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed. Any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as Moody’s or Standard &amp; Poor’s may adversely impact our ability to obtain external financing or the terms of such financing. Credit agency downgrades or concerns regarding our credit worthiness may impact relationships with our suppliers, who may limit our credit lines. Our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives. If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected.

# We have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.

Our total debt as of June 25, 2016 was $2.2 billion, net of unamortized debt issuance costs. Our substantial indebtedness may:

* make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments;
* limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes;
* limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;
* require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;
* place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with relatively less debt; and
* increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.

We enter into interest rate swap agreements from time to time to manage our exposure to interest rate risk. These swap agreements involve risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, the risk that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates and the risk that our exposure to interest rates may increase if interest rates increase.

We also enter into sale and factoring arrangements from time to time with respect to certain of our accounts receivables, which arrangements are non-recourse to us in the event that an account debtor fails to pay for credit-related reasons, and are not included in our indebtedness. We could become obligated to repurchase such accounts receivables or otherwise incur liability to the counterparties under these arrangements under certain circumstances, such as where a commercial dispute arises between us and an account debtor.

# The agreements governing our notes and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business.

The indentures governing our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2020 (7.75% Notes), 7.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (7.50% Notes), 7.00% Senior Notes due 2024 (7.00% Notes) and 6.75% Senior Notes due 2019 (6.75% Notes) contain various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things:

* incur additional indebtedness;
* pay dividends and make other restricted payments;
* make certain investments, including investments in our unrestricted subsidiaries;
* create or permit certain liens;
* create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us;
* use the proceeds from sales of assets;
* enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and
* consolidate or merge or sell our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety.

Our Secured Revolving Line of Credit also contains various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things, make certain investments, merge or consolidate with other entities and permit certain subsidiaries from incurring indebtedness. In addition, further restrictions apply when certain payment conditions (the Payment Conditions) are not satisfied with respect to specified transactions, events or payments. The Payment Conditions include that (i) no default or event of default exists and (ii) at all times during the 45 consecutive days immediately prior to such transaction, event or payment and on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such transaction, event or payment and any incurrence or repayment of indebtedness in connection therewith, the Loan Parties’ Excess Cash Availability (as defined in the First Amended and Restated Loan Agreement) available cash is greater than the greater of 20% of the total commitment amount and $100 million. If Payment Conditions are not satisfied under certain circumstances, we will become subject to various additional covenants which limit our ability to, among other things:

* create any liens upon any of the Loan Parties’ property (other than customary permitted liens and liens on up to $1.5 billion of secured credit facilities debt (which amount includes our Secured Revolving Line of Credit));
* declare or make cash distributions;
* create any encumbrance on the ability of a subsidiary to make any upstream payments;
* make asset dispositions other than certain ordinary course dispositions and certain supply chain finance arrangements;
* make certain loans, make payments with respect to subordinated debt or certain borrowed money prior to its due date; and
* become party to certain agreements restricting the Loan Parties’ ability to enter into any non-arm’s-length transaction with an affiliate.

The agreements governing our notes and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings. For example, the occurrence of a default with respect to any indebtedness or any failure to repay debt when due in an amount in excess of $50 million would cause a cross default under the indentures governing our 7.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes, 7.00% Notes and 6.75% Notes, as well as under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders or the lenders under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable. If the note holders or the trustee under the indentures governing our 7.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes, 7.00% Notes, 6.75% Notes or the lenders under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings.

16-09-01,50l8zj,Analysis of AMD impact on WSB today.,[removed],1
16-09-01,50laaq,Analysis of AMD impact on WSB today.,"So I decided to do a quick and dirty break down of WSB AMD holdings according to the impromptu poll located here- [REDACTED BECAUSE AUTOMOD IS RETARDED AND WON'T ALLOW LINKS TO /r/WALLSTREETBETS].

I am not counting the people reporting zero, and I am leaving out the numbers for one user, /U/FlossPC for reasons that will emasculate you later.

16 people gave their input representing 3400 shares at a cost of $24742.76. WSB collective cost basis for AMD based on the sample is $7.27.

First observation- WTF, that is fucking pathetic. you retards have been pumping and obsessing over this stock for a fucking year. this circle jerk started in the 2's, and of the 16 people that responded only 2 had a cost basis under $7. To all the people over 7, you are idiots. Way to go buying at the top. don't be proud, be fucking ashamed.

So, we will use the opening price for the day, 7.52, and AH closing price of 7.09 for the next part.

Our sample opened the day at $25,568. up $825.24 from your initial investment. Way to go sport. If you all split that you would have had just over fifty bucks a piece. enough money to take your boy friends out to Applebee's AND split a Long Island.

But of course we all know you faggots didn't sell at open, which was also the high of the day.

You all ended the day at a collective $24,106, for a total loss of $1462.24, or about 90 bucks a piece.

Wait, that is it? what the fuck are you babies bitching about?

What ever, moving on to the emasculation.

/U/FlossPC controls 9140 shares at a cost basis of 4.97. Yeah, he has over 40 times as many shares as the average robinhood faggot at a cost basis a third less that the rest of you.

He started the day at $68,732.8. He ended the day at $64,802.60. He lost more money in one day than any of the faggots responding even put in to buy shares in the first place.

Don't worry about him though, he is still up $19376.80. just 5 grand less than the rest of you invested in the first place.

So in closing, while you dipshits sit there crying about your huge losses remember, on average you lost less money than most of us spend at the bar in a single night. Also remember, you are insignificant next at least one other user who I am sure is not even close to having the largest position on the sub.",26

16-09-01,50ma6o,What Actually Just Happened To $AMD,"Since most of you don't seem to be getting it, I'll explain.

There's a month old rumor that AMD was diversifying its manufacturing by adding Samsung fabs to the mix.  The contract amendment they just announced is very likely confirmation of that rumor.  And it's a good thing for AMD.  I say ""likely"" because it *could* just mean they're going to use TSMC more.  Either way, it's still good for AMD.

AMD has a Wafer Supply Agreement with GlobalFoundries that locks them into building most of their products in GloFo's fabs.  In exchange, they get better prices and yield guarantees.  Basically this allows GloFo to absorb the cost of ramping a new production node, because they know AMD is going to keep coming back for more business.

However, that presents problems if they max out GloFo's capacity.  The new deal, which cost AMD $100M in cash (split over four quarters) and $235M in a warrant granted to GloFo's sister holding company, allows them to ""step out"" with another fab to increase production volume.

There's one and only one reason Lisa Su would pay GloFo $335M to gain access to third-party fabs, and it's not because AMD is about to go bankrupt.  It's because AMD is about to exceed GloFo's production capabilities by producing tons of Polaris, Zen and Vega chips.

The stock price may be a roller-coaster ride for a while, but this is great news for the long term.  I'm looking for the nadir to buy a ton of calls.

And, by the way, if you think this means AMD is going bankrupt, please explain why GloFo accepted most of it's payment in a stock warrant and why that warrant has a value of $235M with a $5.98 exercise price.  Good luck figuring that out, geniuses.",204

There is no single answer to this question, but we will also need A LOT MORE information if we are to give some sort of answer

* How old are you?
* Are you employed/making income? How much?
* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)
* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)
* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
* Any big debts?
* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.

16-09-01,50mv8w,Listen up - $BOFI ftw,"Long time listener, first time caller here. My qualifications for this post and furthermore, this thread are such that I have indeed shed tears of happiness and sadness on DUST, in amounts I'm guessing much more than half you clowns posting 100% portfolio allocations. Either you've got enough time to waste setting up a brand new account, or you really are betting grammies bar mitzvah money. In either case, you should probably get back to mowing lawns or whatever it is you do on summer break.

Now, to the real business. BOFI is going to blast off over the next 1-3 months. Was at ~$35 in Q3 last year, dropped because of some whistler-blower nonsense (some buffoon that got fired because he sucked at his job, now he's hired a power hungry attorney without much of a case). Dismissal hearing for those allegations on September 23. No other reason for it to be suppressed (if somebody mentions HRB's poor first quarter I'm going to laugh in their face. I could care less how HRB performs from May - July. If you're worried about HRB fiscal Q1 performance then I'm guessing you suck so much at this that you don't file taxes).

We're at ~$21.50 now, exclude betting on the financial sector for the jobs report/interest rate drivers, BOFI is going to skyrocket on its own. It's got 40% short float and those idiots are non-stop posting desperate articles on SA to try and crash it. No joke, these knob goblins are trying to interpret the general risks section of the 10-k. I'm pretty my pre-school teacher taught us those are just boilerplate disclaimers.

Let's get some visibility on this bitch and watch her run.

Generally, you pay a higher tax on gains held for less than 1 calendar year. However, is *most* cases, (excluding holding contracts for a year/two out) your options are valid for about 1 week to 3 months. Are these taxed different thank a typical buy/sell of a stock or is there a different rate for option gains?

16-09-01,50o2kv,"85% gain on spy puts (sep 7, 217 puts) bought today, feel like it was completely a gamble, feel like shit","Proof - http://imgur.com/UHlnSCl (kept about $70 in cash because I was a little short to buy a 3rd contract)

Just put some play money into my etrade account, ($275) which actually stood at $10,000 last year from a $6,000 investment into $GTATQ over a period of 6 months (December 2014 and continued to average DOWN until June 2015 or so) 

The investment finally played off in September 2015, as the stock skyrocketed from 6 cents to .63. I was not averaged that low however.

http://imgur.com/SCh5x6a - Here I just sold, bought at a lower price.

That came crashing down as I lost about $3,000 in one day on GTATQ when the bankruptcy court denied equity involvement in the case.

at $7,000 I played GTATQ again and lost $2k as new developments in the bk case gave me hope that volatility would come 

at $5,000 I played bankrupt coal company ANRZQ and lost about half, $2,500. Sold out after the BK court once again denied equity a spot in BK negotiations (bought at .02, sold at .01, This would turn out to be my last BK play in fact)

At $2,500 I bought way otm oil calls on 2 oil companies (Breitburn and Linn) for .05 each contract ($5 a contract + commission, I coulda bought these for .01 if I knew that was even possible, I was a newbie to options. Oh well) in December 2015, before the crash in January. I remeber buying these options and forfeiting any thoughts of getting this money back.

I think it was in February or march, that oil had its turnaround and I was able to almost double my money in one day. I remember thinking, for 3 months I have had $0, now I have $4.2k. WSB time!

I sold my calls that same day. (woulda quadra'd it at the least had I bought the calls at $1 dollar a contract..)

At $4.2k I invested into $SUNE (around March, before the BK) and lost $600 before leaving it. Because I finally had MONEY AGAIN AND WAS TIRED OF READING SUNE HYPE ON THIS SUB WITHOUT INVESTING IN IT. I wanted to join in on the fun

at $3,600 I decided to try SPY options. 

anddddd lost it all betting on spy puts over and over and over..

So now I am here with my first ""investment"" since March, and needless to say I feel pretty hopeless about doing well in the stock/options market. 

Anyone else just feel like they are gambling outright when they play options?

Fuck. Anyways where should I put that $400 now :^ )",28

16-09-01,50oaip,"I bought my first stock 10 years ago. I've had some good ideas and bad ideas but learned a lot. This is my portfolio and these are my returns. AMA","[Today is the first day that I've had a ""10-year"" performance return.](http://imgur.com/a/ROsCG) The graph understates my returns and overstates the S&amp;P returns, but it's close enough for Reddit. Nothing to brag about, but something to learn from.

I didn't pay much attention to my returns until three years ago, when they actually started looking good. If I looked into it, I'd probably find that I do better when I trade less often. My portfolio turnover is about 0.52%.

This is my portfolio as it looks right now. There are other investments I've been fond of in the past, but these are the ones I still have. I try to look for companies that have a stable financial position, an underappreciated competitive position, and a smart management team, preferably with a company founder still in charge. What I often end up with (probably subconsciously) are turnaround situations that take a few years to develop, or never turn. I am sometimes too slow to sell--it's a reaction from selling too quickly following the high returns of what I bought in late 2008.

I do have a bigger cash position, but I keep it in a different account for a kind of ""everything is going on sale"" market situation.

AMA - I am not making any recommendations on what you should or should not buy/sell.

Venezuela's economy is in some deep trouble and they've been selling their gold reserves to pay their debts to China.  OPEC countries gold reserves have decreased by a third in the last twelve months.  How much longer will reserves last at this rate?  When these reserves have been depleted and gold prices are no longer being suppressed are we going to the moon?

My question is why isn't the delay more like a minute? 

I understand the argument that faster trades allow more up to date price information to come into the market faster. But after hours people seem to be fine with essentially no price information hitting the market. Why not delay some sane amount? You'd completely get rid of HST and the delay in price information hitting the market seems minimal. In addition, with that amount of time you might end up with algorithms that resulted in better priced trades, rather than just on ones that were fast.

16-09-01,50ntf4,Friday Jobs and JNUG,"I have been thinking about the gold trade since the discussion started around the Fed talking about jobs data as one of the aspects they look at in making rate increase decisions.

I've also seen some serious autistic joy recently with regard to DUST in August as a result of the same Fed hiking fears. 

While I don't think gold is going to the moon I do think this economy is not doing as well as many of the ""expert economists"" say and inflation isn't exploding. Add to that the fact that August job numbers generally suck and are revised up often. (See below)

The RIA compliance firm we work with even makes us do VWAP testing for limit order trades on equities we run through our custodian's website. I feel like the compliance company we work with just tries to scare the shit out of us, and find compliance problems where there isn't any just to bill us. I see other RIAs post content and do a lot of the exact things that we want to do for marketing but it gets bogged down in compliance. I feel like some of the compliance guidance that they are telling us we need to do isn't something the regulators would reasonably expect a firm of our size to actually do (~100m). To me it seems that the compliance firm's incentives are to make compliance as big of a problem as possible for us so they can bill more. It doesn't help that our CCO is fairly old and doesn't quite understand technology, so he might be susceptible to fearmongering.

Here is the situation if I retire:
Social Security:$1910/month
Pension from previous company: $710/month
Savings: $40K
401K: $300K

I am thinking about moving the $300K in my 401k to a fixed annuity of about $1300/month for life. Together with my pension and SS, it will amount to almost $4000/month (before Taxes)

Is there a better option for my situation than the fixed annuity?

Edit: Thanks for all the great advice! Here are a few more details:

1. I have been active and healthy (running and gym) all my life. Never smoked. 5'9"", 170 pounds. Both parents still living and doing well. 

2. The annuity I am considered will pay the difference between the price of the annuity and the amount of the monthly payments at time of dead to a beneficiary.

3. Currently renting.

4. Recently sat down with a Financial Planner. Suggested to put $100K on annuity  and rest on one of their investment program, but it was very expensive ($140/month)


5. Low tolerance for risk now.

6. My monthly expenses are around $3500/month right. 

7. 0 debt.
 
8. Not supporting parents or children.

16-09-01,50q38m,$1.2 million FD RIP,"Trader bets $1.2 million on Bank of America – and could make a 633 percent profit

Annie Pei	August 31, 2016
Bank of America's summer surge has some traders betting on further upside for the stock.

Wanting to cash in, one trader in particular made a $1.2 million bet on the bank that could see him reaping rewards this Friday.

On Tuesday morning, one trader bought about 100,000 September 2nd weekly 16-strike calls for 12 cents per share, or $12 per options contract. The trade was made when Bank of America (BAC) was trading at around $15.90, and it has a break-even level of $16.12. If the stock closes below $16 on Friday, the entire $1.2 million spent in options premium will be lost.

While the trade initially looked good, with BofA closing at $16.19 on Tuesday, the stock sold off Wednesday morning.

Still, through midday trading, the shares remained at about $15.85, which Brian Stutland of Equity Armor Investments calls a level of support.

In fact, Tuesday on CNBC's ""Fast Money,"" Stutland predicted that the stock could rise to $16.88 in the near term.",4

And with that data I can create various kinds of reports/dashboards/etc. 

Now the question is what data would you like to see in such a web app?

What it currently does is following: First you see latest news, list of most mentioned companies and news extremes. And you can also set the time-frame on those things.
For example see what companies were mentioned in the last 6 hours and what was the average sentiment of those news. ( http://i.imgur.com/ccE3T1A.png )

Or see the company sentiment history (how many times that company was mentioned in given day and average sentiment of those news) ( http://i.imgur.com/k7jizAs.png )

And also the world map where you see which countries are talked about in what kind of way. ( map of last day: http://i.imgur.com/FWEE8x9.png )
Or the map of last month was following: http://i.imgur.com/XDmufrA.png (Well, it seems that most of the news written are in negative way)

Album: http://imgur.com/a/8aSYE?reg

Now as I know very little about investing the question is what other kind of things could be used by you? 
I was thinking about adding some dashboards where companies are consolidated in some way (by industry for example?) or something like that. 

I did upload pictures so that you don't have to go to my app to see current functionality to get the idea what I'm talking about 
but if you are interested in that the address is http://www.reflecthub.com/ . But it is currently in early development phase, so some things may not be as pretty 
as I want and may be in some cases there can be some bugs as well.

16-09-01,50pu33,Choosing a portfolio based on market pricing,"My financial advisers allocate my portfolio of mutual funds based on how markets are priced against earnings. They've shown me data that shows, for example, that if you buy and hold an S&amp;P 500 index fund when the U.S. market is priced in the upper quintile of historic prices, then you can expect poor returns over surprisingly long time periods, like 40 years. And likewise, if you buy when the market is priced in the lower quintile of historic prices, you can expect great returns.

This sounds reasonable, but my portfolio -- controlled by them and based on this philosophy -- has performed pretty badly over the past 10 years. For example, for a while they've felt the U.S. market is overpriced, so I've had little U.S. exposure and missed those spectacular gains in 2012-2014.

Reading the posts on this board and financial books, I have not encountered anyone repeating what my financial advisers say about choosing portfolios based on current market pricing. I'm wondering if they're out to lunch or if there is some academic basis for what they're doing...?",3

Halliburton, and it's subsidiary KBR inc. is one of the largest military contractors in US and indeed, the world. They profit from conflicts; receiving 39.5 billion in contracts over the span of a decade in the Iraq war alone. 

A Hillary presidency, god forbid, would undoubtedly be a good thing for Halliburton. She is as Warhawk-ish as they come, and already in bed with them anyways.

A Trump presidency would be good for Halliburton in a very interesting way. The wall in mexico. Who's going to pay for it? Mexico. But who is going to *BUILD* it? Likely a well established military contractor with experience constructing barriers on the board. That's right, Halliburton.

However, I have an HSA at Fidelity, and an IRA at Schwab. This means that I have access to two separate commission-free ETF sources. This is great because it allows me to cover deficiencies in one source with the other and vice versa. However, it does lead me to the fact that I need to compare my options and identify which source has better ETFs.

For example: I would like to compare IJR and SCHA. Both are US Small Cap Blends. Both can be acquired commission-free.

**SCHA pros**

* Lower expense ration (.08% vs .~~17~~12%)
* Higher MarketEdge power rating and score. (80, -1 vs. 40, -2)

Reason 2: They are manufacturing the newest Google Phone.

And that means a lot because their biggest competition is no other than fucking Facebook. They are also looking to keep their lead in VR through innovation ( The Wireless HTC Vive Prototype will be shown in Fall. Another thing going for them is that they have a close relationship with Valve. VR is steadily growing, just look at all the huge Developers making Vr Games right now: Bethesda is Bringing Fallout 4, one of the best selling Games of the last year exclusively to the HTC Vive, Square Enix is working on Vive Games, Ubisoft has like 6 VR games comping out this Winter and According to Gabe Newell, 50% of Valve is now working on VR.

16-09-02,50sf41,New semester is starting - Participate in the Open Yale Course on Financial Markets (Econ 252)!,"#Introduction
A while back the [**Open Yale Course on Financial Markets**](http://oyc.yale.edu/economics/econ-252-11) generated [some](https://np.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/4brd9d/since_rinvesting_appears_to_be_hot_for_shkreli/) interest on /r/investing. It is time to take it one step further - time to see who's up to actually take the course. 

23 lectures on Financial Markets, ranging from understanding different securities to efficient markets. Each lecture takes roughly 75 minutes, and are provided for by respected economists. As mentioned before - I doubt you will find content of this quality for free easily elsewhere. 

Over the next 26 weeks, we will do a mutual effort to complete this course. You are free to decide *how* you participate. If you just watch the YouTube videos and be done with it, that is fine. If you want to dedicate some serious time to learning how financial markets work, there is recommended reading, a weekly discussion thread, and perhaps you may even want to take the exam to see how well you perform! 

Nothing is required - this should be open to anyone who wish to participate. Regardless of the level of commitment. 

#How does it work?
Every weekend, I will create a thread (and send out e-mails) with the study material for that week. This includes primarily the lecture, but also the reading material and any assignments you can make to test yourself. You can also find the syllabus yourself on the landing page of [Yale Open Courses ECON 252](http://oyc.yale.edu/economics/econ-252-11#overview). 

At the end of the week, I will open a discussion and questions thread and post some questions myself - see whether that sparks some interesting discussions. 

#If you wish to participate.
**Let me know in this thread** if you want to get a weekly mention when a new thread goes live. Additionally (or alternatively), if you wish to receive updates by e-mail, send a message to **oyc.reddit [at] gmail.com**. I will not use your e-mail for any purpose but this course. 

You can also send question to that e-mail if you wish to see any topics discussed in the weekly question and discussion threads. 

#What do you need? 
That, of course, depends on what you want to get out of this course. If you are in it for the YouTube videos, a computer and a live internet connection will do fine (given that you here, I suppose that is not an issue).

The main texts accompanying the course are: 

* Fabozzi, Frank J., Franco Modigliani, Frank J. Jones, and Michael G. Ferri. *Foundations of Financial Markets and Institutions*, 4th ed. Prentice Hall, 2010.

* Shiller, Robert J. *Finance and the Good Society*. Princeton University Press, 2012.

You can likely get both in your (university) library. Alternatively, you can pick them up at Amazon, either used (~$25-40 total) or new.

Right now I've got Level 2 quotes with OptionsHouse and I can see the information in real time, but I'd like to find a way to review daily information after the close.

Specifically, I'd like to be able to see the number of lots bought/sold over 5000 or 10000 shares.  

Also, I'd like to see the actual buy/sell (or bid/ask) skew for the day.  For this order skew I'm not looking for call/put skew but actual share lot orders placed.  (i.e.- If the volume was 500000 shares for the day but there were actually 20% more bids placed that weren't filled, etc)

Can anyone point me in the correct direction to find this information?",3

As for Clinton's plan:

""Clinton plans to create a drug-pricing oversight group that will monitor price increases. If this group of federal officials decides that an increase is excessive, it could take a number of enforcement actions, including making emergency purchases of an alternate version of the drug, allowing emergency imports of a similar product from other developed countries, and imposing penalties on the companies, such as fines.""

* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)
* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)

Reason 1: Their Phones are improving a lot, look at the HTC Phone reviews of the last few years and then look at the last Phone, they have finally become competitive again.


Reason 2: They are manufacturing the newest Google Phone.



Reason 3: They currently have the by far best Product in a potential Billion Dollar Industry, VR. The HTC Vive is without a doubt better than every other Competitor on the Market right now.  And that means a lot because their biggest competition is no other than fucking Facebook. And as you can see here there are almost 2 times as many Vives as there are Oculus Rifts: http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/ .They are also looking to keep their lead in VR through innovation ( The Wireless HTC Vive Prototype will be shown in Fall. Another thing going for them is that they have a close relationship with Valve. VR is steadily growing,  just look at all the huge Developers making Vr Games right now: Bethesda is Bringing Fallout 4, one of the best selling Games of the last year exclusively to the HTC Vive, Square Enix is working on Vive Games, Ubisoft has like 6 VR games comping out this Winter and According to Gabe Newell, 50% of Valve is now working on VR.


Reason 4: Their Q2 earnings beat Q1s by 27%.

16-09-02,50txmj,Ridiculous call volume for TLRD today. Earnings report on September 7th.,"Update from my thread here 6 days ago.

Volume for Sep16 15.00 strike calls just went way up. Total open interest for these calls is now *over 10,000*. This number is greater than the open interest for all other calls and puts **combined**. I actually don't know if this last claim is true or not because I didn't and also don't want to add numbers together, but I believe it's true, and that should be good enough for you retards. 

There was a block trade for 511 calls at 75 cents each just a while ago. However, I'm inclined to believe that a single person is responsible for purchasing around 1000 out of 1100+ total daily calls today. A flurry of trades, some small some large, were made within 8 minutes of each other; ending in a final block trade of 511 calls. 

A single purchase may be routed to different exchanges to fulfill the order, either through actual people selling calls or market makers. So when I say 'blocks', I mean that the purchase(s) may or may not be two separate trades from different people, but is almost certainly from one person and one trade.

* 10:26:33 - 2 blocks for 60 calls total

* 10:28:27 - 9 blocks for 100 calls total

* 10:28:39 - 2 blocks for 50 calls total

You get the point. This continues, with multiples of 10, over the course of 8 minutes. They add up to exactly 1000 shares. I haven't actually added the numbers together past those first 3 times but, again, I think it's probably true. 

Combined with relatively massive open interest, the likes of which I have never seen in my entire life this week, I think TLRD is in for a huge surprise. Call volume completely outstrips put volume, and as of August 15th, there are 7 million shares short (14-15% of float). 

I don't think TLRD will stay below $13 for longer than a month unless they announce something stupid. Like another acquisition, management change, or policy change on their discount practices. Unlike other things, I don't think a beat has been priced in yet because of how many times investors have been disappointed. Options might not even be worth buying this time considering how unlikely it is for you to lose money long-term by purchasing shares. 

---

As always, do your own DD and shit. I'm hedged, but not by a lot. Even my FDA plays are less risky than this position. The risk is very real with these Sep16 calls, so don't buy calls if you're not willing to lose 100%. I'm long shares and 2018 calls, but I also have 2 grand in Sep16 calls that I'm willing to lose entirely. 

There's nothing to indicate that TLRD will beat in their upcoming earnings report next week other than call volume and my shitty article that I can message to you if you ask nicely.

The idea was that those stocks would go up after Wii Fit was successful, we'd sell, etc. However Wii Fit bombed and after that the stock prices for Nintendo only went downhill. At one point our $30 stocks were near $10 but we just held on to them. 



PokemonGo came out and I sheepishly checked to see what went on with the stock because I wasn't sure people would invest with them seeing as they weren't the primary makers of the game, but it bumped up to $37 at it's max. I'm 20 now and I urged my parents to sell them while they were up because the way I see Nintendo, it's just going to be a lot of ups and down and there might not be another time to get those stocks off our hands at a profit and invest them elsewhere. My parents didn't make a move with them and now they're back under the price we bought them at. 

My question is, was hanging onto them the right move or do you think that it would've been better if we'd sold them and invested that money elsewhere?

The general strategy being          
&gt;Short US/DM equity           
&gt;Long US treasuries        
&gt;Long hard assets: gold miners and farm land       
&gt;Long EM          

Additionally        

&gt;Short/Avoid Indexes    
&gt;Long specific stocks     
&gt;Long active management (timing and position sizing)     

There has been no movement of capital (distribution or contribution) since last month. I have switched methodology to reporting at month end.

Performance has been achieved maintaining a 35-45% position in U.S. Treasuries and Cash. Current positioning is 140%/40% long/short      

&gt;**Performance:** May: -2.2%, June: 12.4%, July:8.1%, August: -7.6% Since Start: 14.2% as of September 2        
&gt;**Benchmark (SPY+dividend)** May: 1.4%, June 0.6%, July 3.1%, August: -0.4% Since Start: 6.4% as of September 2               

Current 1 month performance is (7.6%), primarily driven by the correction in gold miners from fed jawboning. As of September 2, the poor jobs numbers have held back any prospect of fed rate hikes, the resulting recovery in gold miners have made the current positions recover more than half of the recent losses.  

**GDX/GDXJ:** I have nearly doubled my positioning in gold miners, taking advantage of the decline. I continue to be extremely skeptical of a fed rate hike. The fed has trapped themselves by signaling a strong economy despite weakish PMI and employment growth and non-existent inflation. Now the fed is forced to signal it is willing to raise rates to *signal* it has confidence in the economy while continuously delaying the hike because it knows the economy is not strong enough. This internal contradiction continues to create volatility and good entry opportunities. 

**EWJ:** I have entered a 20k short position in EWJ, as a proxy for shorting Japanese equity and a way to hedge against global illiquidity. BOJ has engaged in a largest monetary experiment program by any large central bank, acquiring all new issuance of JGBs for a country continuously running 5-10% fiscal deficits. BOJ is also acquiring USD30 billion of etfs and indexes. As a result, many investors have moved into the Nikkei last year as a way to front-run the expected buying. However, there is currently a greater internal debate within the BOJ between those who believe continuous monetary expansion and negative rates will cause a banking/insurance collapse chain reaction from the negative spread in marginal assets and those who believe the program must continue to bring up inflation. The former group will likely to gain traction the longer the program goes without driving up inflation and more and more small and medium sized bank edge towards the precipice. If the BOJ does pullback on its easing, it would likely reduce equity buying first (due to the illiquidity now in the JGB market, with the BOJ as the only buyer), and eventually cause a carry trade unwind, a strengthening yen, falling foreign assets and a falling Nikkei. As a result, the Yen and Nikkei are good positioning for a global risk on/off likely to emerge from Japan.  

**IEF:** U.S. Treasuries continue to be (cheap) at 1.6% for the 10 year compared against (0.04%) in Germany, (0.03%) in Japan and 1.1% in Italy. 

**JD:** JD has gone up by more than 20% over the cost basis. I still believe it is best in class in its category. I have very little faith in the character of jack ma from his alipay spinoff without shareholder consent and his random football team purchases. My interactions with Hillhouse has led me to believe that Richard is much more shareholder friendly and has built a better firm culture which is less likely to take shortcuts

16-09-03,50ws6n,A short guide to stock investing for beginners,"*I have put up a section instead of the full article because it contains table format*

Learning to invest in the stock market is different from say, learning maths. Whereas everyone eventually reaches the same solution in the latter, there’s no one right answer on how to invest well. Nonetheless, there are overriding similarities between learning the both, or any sorts of skills. The fastest way to learn a skill is to deconstruct it by breaking it into pieces, strip down to their essence, and examine the fundamentals.

Fundamentals provide a solid foundation, like a sturdy building holding up against shocks, so you won’t fall apart during a market panic. Investing is a slow learning process, same as everything you set out to do, like a car in first gear going uphill. And don’t worry about missing out opportunities. If the boat is not in the right direction, it doesn’t matter how fast it goes. Instead, aim for 1%, strive to improve yourself by 1% every day, it adds up over time. Build a long runway, and focus on what matters and ignore the trivial. When your knowledge compounds, your wealth follows.

In the stock market, every share you own is a slice of ownership in the business, essentially, you are the owner. You are entitled to vote, receive a dividend, if there’s one, and participate in the fortune of the business as a shareholder. You grow your wealth through the dividends received, and share price appreciation as the business makes more money.

Most investors watch their shares like a hawk, reasoned a drop in share price would impair investment capital. That is true if the shares are sold to realize the loss, but otherwise, flies in contrary to the mindset of an owner. If an asset can be acquired at a lower price, in this case, the whole business, isn’t that a positive thing? As opposed to a falling share price, the risk of an investor comes from not knowing what he is doing. If one buys a property but never take the trouble to inspect, or walk around the neighborhood, is it a surprise if the house is in a poor condition sitting in an unsafe neighborhood?

Similar to doing research before getting a fridge, a car, or a house, a big part of investing lies in preparation, doing the work before buying, and spending the time to understand the business. These knowledge create a psychological edge, and the ability to think independently, a rare and valuable trait in investing during market panic. You can assess the situation with a calm head before making the right decision rather than rushing to the exit doors like everyone else.

Your profession or things that surround your daily life are good starting points to learn more about a business and industry. If you work in the I.T industry, chances are you will be familiar with some software providers; if you are a car enthusiast, which stores do you always visit and for what reasons? Even if you’re a stay at home mom, you might have developed a good understanding where to find quality ingredients. By observing things around you, you have a good judgment on what’s selling, and what doesn’t. Look for the label, find out which company produce it and how well the business is doing.

Given the choice between a wonderful and an average business, you’ll prefer to invest in the former. But how do you distinguish the former from the latter? Is there any characteristic that defines a company as wonderful?

If one of your friends comes to you with an idea of starting a business together, you will ask questions like:
1. What kind of business is it?
2. How much investment do I have to put into the business?
3. How much money can the business make every year and how fast?

The first question focuses on having a good grasp on what the business does. If your friend is going to start something that you can’t get your head around, never ever get involved.

16-09-02,50uwkb,A piece of advice for how to accumulate wealth,"The key to success in life is to live below your means, and invest all of your money. If you follow this strategy, even a mcdonalds cashier can become wealthy. Only buy what you need, and invest the rest of your money in mutual funds, bonds, stable dividend stocks, and your 401k. The truth is, ""yolo"" doesn't work, and in the long run you will lose money. I see people here who buy stock on impulse, based on what's on the front page. They're trying to ""get rich quick"" by trading. That isn't how it works. The stock market can be used to make you very rich. Or it can take all of your money, bend you over, and fuck you hard without a condom on. The difference between rich people and poor people is this - rich people are smart with their money and use it to create future cash flow. Warren Buffet didn't get rich by gambling penny stocks and biotech. He invests in strong companies that he sees future growth in, based on fundamentals. More people should be doing that here, instead of throwing your money away. Take this advice if you want, if you don't it'll be your loss. I'm a 62 year old man who starting investing in my 401k at age 20. I lived in a studio apartment in the city, and invested every penny I made from my dead end retail job. I've been retired for 8 years living on a beach in florida. I'm literally stoned every day, and at night I go to the club and get turnt up as hell. Last week I fucked a slut who had triple D's. I drive a Rolls Royce with chrome rims. I could literally have your mom on her knees with how much money I have right now. Just my 2 cents

16-09-02,50w6xk,How to get 3x Leverage with futures without buying a 3x leveraged ETF?,"Lets say for a minute that I want to take a 3x leveraged position in the s&amp;p 500. I could buy SPXL, but there is lots of good information out there about why a long position in leveraged ETFs is generally a bad idea.

I've been thinking about how an investor could create this situation in another way, without using the ETF.

My thought originally was to use call options with long expiration dates, but the premiums paid made it seem like the fees from re-rolling the options would be more than the fees/risks in the leveraged ETF.

My next idea was to trade e-mini S&amp;P 500 futures contracts.

Here is my example:

Say I have $100,000. I want to take a position of 3x that in the S&amp;P 500, or $300,000.

I see that the S&amp;P 500 Emini is trading at $2000. This means each emini contract is worth $100,000.

So in this case I can buy 3 contracts, getting $300,000 worth of a position, and paying $6000 + commissions. 

If I take the remaining $94,000 and stick it in a money market fund and keep it in reserve, then my position is roughly 3x leveraged.

If the S&amp;P future contract goes down 10%, my $300,000 is now worth $270,000. I've lost $30,000 on my $100,000 investment, giving me a net loss of 30% before fees and expenses.

Similarly if it goes up 10%, I've gained $30,000 and made 30% profit before fees and expenses. 

As long as I sell the future contract before it is due, I won't ever have to pay the actual $300,000 up front, correct?

Would this be a valid way of getting 3x market exposure without having to deal with compounding loss problems that occur in funds like SPXL?



I do understand that if the market goes down more than 33%, I essentially will owe money that I don't have sitting in the money market fund, which is a serious risk.

16-09-02,50w7z0,Can someone explain why a company 1 day away from delisting would get a giant bump in volume/price (NASDAQ: ROKA)?,"I follow biotech stocks because I am in the industry. On Wednesday, a small company called Roka Bioscience (NASDAQ:ROKA) that was set to be delisted the next day (9/1) because of their long-term &lt;$1 status suddenly traded at 70X their typical volume, and shot up 40% to ~$1.50. According to their last earnings report, they are set to sink by the end of the year. They've asked for a hearing from NASDAQ, which pauses the delisting, and promised a reverse split if that doesn't go well for them.

My question is why would this happen? A flagging company that's about to be booted from NASDAQ is suddenly a hot buy? Is there something I'm missing as to why this would be a 'buy"" scenario?

My best guesses are: 

1. current investors stood to lose by the delisting and so threw good money after bad to pump the price in hopes of aiding the delisting hearing

2. they're courting new investors who pumped the price for similar reasons

**Smith &amp; Wesson Board Votes to Offer Emergency Share Repurchase in Effort to ""Save Idiots From Themselves""**

BREAKING: 

Smith &amp; Wesson ($SWHC) Chairman Barry Monheit held a press conference Friday afternoon, announcing that his company's Board of Directors had voted in favor of an emergency share repurchase for up to 100,000 shares out of their approximately 55 million share float.  

""To qualify for the program,"" he explained, ""shareholders must already hold accounts with the brokerage RobinHood, or otherwise prove that they're active users on the website r/WallStreetBets.  We're offering a dollar more than whatever it is you paid - hell, two dollars, I don't care!  For the love of God, just please take the money!""  

Participating does carry certain restrictions.  ""For one, you'll be signing an agreement to never post publicly about our company again.  Ever.  You will also agree to never again trade any SWHC shares or options.""  

When asked why the Board had voted for such unprecedented actions, Monheit appeared visibly frustrated.  ""We're trying to maintain our dignity, and we're trying to save these idiots from themselves.  The individuals invited to the program - while I'm sure their intentions are good - they just, frankly, they make us look bad.  They plaster 'SWHC' all over everything on the their site, and everything they say is best described as utter, uneducated bullshit.  And for chrissakes, it's all starting to show up on Google search results!  With all due respect, these people have no idea what they're doing.  They're insultingly bad at this.""  

Monheit then looked directly at the cameras, and offered one final plea. ""Please, just leave us the hell alone!""  ",183

16-09-03,50y1zl,Semi-Ridiculous Hypothetical,"So let's pretend you yolo your way up to multi-millions. At what net worth figure do you pull $1M in hundo's out the system, split it into a couple piles, vacuum-seal the fuck out of them, and bury in your mom's back yard, a fireproof safe under your floor boards, an offshore safety deposit box, etc.

Seems like at a certain net worth, it'd be the prudent thing to do. You're obviously gonna move plenty of your assets into ultra safe bonds, etc. But I'm imagining it'd be wise risk management for a person of a certain wealth to stash a base level of untraceable ""fuck you money"", just in case they got in a really bad pinch.

Examples:
-Bankrupted by lawsuit judgement for more than your net worth (insurance won't cover because you broke a law).
-A literally ""on the run from the law"" scenario.
-Discreet hush money / bribe to get you out of a jam.

Obviously if you're a billionaire, you're nearly unfuckwitable legally. Not to mention, the sacrificed return from pulling out a couple million to rot away, would be essentially imperceptible. So I'm not thinking about the uber wealthy, more so a guy with 10M. For him, pulling 10% of his net worth out the system &amp; letting inflation eat away at it, would be a little tough to swallow. But it might be the greatest hedge of his life if shit really hit the fan.

Disclaimer: I don't actually expect this to ever apply to me. It just popped in my head that some rich people probably do this, and it intrigued me. 

Hopefully this is WSB enough -- seemed like the logical sub to post such a topic.

This was not good enough. Melanie Trump has hired Hulk Hogan's lawyer, the one that made Gawker file bankruptcy. She has filed a $125 million lawsuit against the Daily Mail the courts are rolling forward. 







[The Daily Mail is a publically traded company in London](http://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DMGT.L?p=DMGT.L) click link to get more info if you want to and can short the shit out of this dumpster fire of a media platform. Not sure how many of you faggots trade the London stock exchange, but I'm crossing my fingers.







Ok so this stock is at 718 a share atm, it was at 518 in july, they had a great late summer. But there market cap is only 2.4 billion atm.

 If this lawsuit goes through we can see a 5% decrease guaranteed driving shares back down to around 683. 

But I don't know how to calculate future vultures piling on extra short interest on the companies shares over this lawsuit. 

So it could go even lower. 



Remember gawker had to file bankruptcy but they were much smaller in capital and assets. 

Daily Mail might also get a sell off further into the court hearings to prevent losses from shareholders. 

And a spike in subscription cancels and users abandoning over controversy. They might repeat June and July and grind down to low 500s again either way even if it is only drops to high 600s, this boat is going to sink a bit even though the market shows they are rising now. 

This means taking short bets will be very cheap right now. Court process takes months so factor that in, quarterly and 6 month plays only. Happy betting centipedes.

16-09-03,510hv7,Could somebody please explain the main message of this article to me?,"
http://www.followingthetrend.com/2016/04/you-cant-beat-all-the-chimps/

To sum up, the author considers the following scenario:
   "" We only pick stocks from the S&amp;P 500 index. Historical membership accounted for of course.
    At the start of each month, we liquidate the portfolio and buy random stocks.
    We buy a random number of random stocks for each new month.
    Each position is given a totally random allocation.""

OUTCOME: According to the author's calculations, this strategy clearly  beats the performance of the S&amp;P 500 index over the last 15 years (see graph).

How is this possible? Wouldn't in this case anybody beat the market, as long as shares are not picked according to market capitalization weights?

This seems to suggest to me that index funds/ETFs are actually a very bad investment strategy - which is contrary to most other opinions I have read on the subject.

My apologies if I am completely off here - would be grateful for an explanation.

16-09-03,50zfeh,Anyone use their paper trading account to get laid? (DD on pussy),"Dat $1,000,000+ account balance looks juicy when the girl has no idea what she's looking at. You can even do it on your phone too, just ""accidentally"" leave the screen face up while you go ""grab a drink"" or go piss. 


Best strategy (mobile paper trading app required)

- Invite girl on date.
- Sit at a table and talk for a bit, mention that you do trading and what it is.
- Nonchalantly leave your simulator app's account balance open and your phone face up on the table.
- Walk away to go to the restroom or get some drinks. 
- She won't be able to resist the temptation to look at your phone while you're away, she'll see the paper account balance, her pussy will soak.  
- Take her home and smash. 


Alternatively (when she's at your place)

-Have all your charts and ticker feeds already open on your multi screen trading desk (I hope you have at least dual monitors). No screen saver, sleep mode turned off.
-Make sure the paper trading account balance is open and on the center screen.**
-When you get back to your place tell her that you need to use the restroom, and leave her in the room by herself. 
-She'll be mesmerized by the charts on your poverty Bloomberg terminal setup and be drawn to it. 
- She'll see the $1,000,000+ account balance and immediately remove her clothes. 
-You might as well undress before you leave the bathroom. 
-Smash. 

** Pro Tip: Make sure you make a mental note of the position of the mouse curser so you can see if she moved it. 

Obviously Robinhood plebs will need to download another app. Hide the icon in a folder so she doesn't accidentally see that you use RH.

16-09-04,512cxr,"How many dividend stocks to invest in. IOW, how broad a portfolio to hold.","Hypothetical, right? ;)

Let's say I have 12K USD to invest in American equities.This represents 25% of the kitty, primarily invested in CAD equity and bonds. (I'm Canadian.) I've got me a nice list of 10-15 prime targets that represent a combination of good dividend yield and some upward growth potential. SInce I want (mostly) good revenue from dividends, and I'm willing to sit on them for a year or more (at least, or unless something causes my stop-loss to kick in), the question is this:

How may equities should I commit to?

I'm comfortable with 5-6, and the risk of lack of diversification that that entails, but wonder if that's the only reason I'd keep from going long on 10 or 12. I can comfortable watch a half dozen, but feel that double that might be a bit more work that I want to commit to.

So is it a matter of ""tough, if you don't want commit time to watch 12 stocks, then invest in a dividend fund instead""?

I ask because a lot of the model, and practical portfolios I'm seeing def consist of smaller stakes in a wider number of equities. $1000 in 30, rather than what I'm thinking of, which is $5000 in 6.

I'd love to hear thoughts of the hive mind on this one, particularly any arguments that go beyond ""diversifying"". Which, if that was what I wanted, would lead me to towards an S&amp;P 500 fund.

16-09-04,513pjh,Trading for a monthly living.,"if I would be trading for a living, and thus would require an income stream from my investments, how would I go about getting the income stream from my stocks?

Would I sell a portion of my stocks each month, would I only sell as much as I have profited that month, would I sell a set percentage from each of my holdings, would I have to day-trade and only invest a set amount at any time? 

I prefer to hold my stocks longer term, and only sell when I am at a loss (stop-loss), but that doesn't give me money to spend obviously.

One stock that caught my eye the other day was CJES (C&amp;J energy) $0.31 at time of writing.

Out of curiosity, I decided to [compare the miner's YTD performance](http://m.imgur.com/7b0vP3W), +506%, against:

JNUG: +589%

NUGT: +349%

SLV: +40%

Basically almost tied with JNUG, and actually beating it [in the past 6 months](http://m.imgur.com/DZtA55w). SVM outperformed NUGT handily in both time frames.


So what's the deal? Why is holding a 3x ETF long term considered autistic, but betting on a depressed junior mining company not? I know: decay, slippage, etc. They track each other very closely, with max draw down slightly higher in the ETFs. But max gain also favours the ETFs.

# Description

Constellation Brands,is an alcoholic beverage company. The Company is a producer and marketer of beer and wine the United States and Canada. Its brands include Corona Extra, Corona Light, Modelo Especial, Ballast Point, Black Velvet Canadian Whisky, SVEDKA Vodka, Meiomi, Robert Mondavi, Wild Horse, among others. Who knows, you may have one of their brands in your ice bucket!

55% of sales are from it's beers, 40% from wine, and it's got the remaining 5% from its spirits business. Though... they focus on imported beers like Corona. They are happy to highlight they have 5 of the 15 top imported beers in their portfolio and 16 of the top 100 selling wine brands.

Finally... they are no stranger to innovation... disgusting as it may sound :)...

&gt; we introduced Modelo Especial Chelada, a blend of beer with flavors of tomato, salt and lime

## Recent financials 

Their reported year end is Feb each year. Maybe to avoid having to do the math after the New Year celebrations! 

Although the revenue growth looks good at first glance, key to remember that STZ is a highly acquisitive business. Spending $5bn in June 2005 to buy Crown Imports, Nava, Modelo rights. And $1bn in Dec 2015 to buy Ballast Point. 

Even so, they've done well in terms of growing earnings. 

|Metric|2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $6.6bn | $6.0bn | $4.9bn | $2.8bn | $2.7bn|
|EPS | $5.18 | $4.17 | $9.83 | $2.04 | $2.13|

aside: Ignore the mega EPS for 2014A they did a little accounting revaluations there!

## Competition

In the beer industry they see Anheuser-Busch InBev, MillerCoors, Heineken, Pabst Brewing Company, &amp; The Boston Beer Company as the key competitors. In the wine business, the list is E&amp;J Gallo Winery, The Wine Group, Trinchero Family Estates, Treasury Wine Estates, Ste. Michelle Wine Estates, Deutsch Family Wine &amp; Spirits, Jackson Family Wines. There are spirits competitors, though remember this is just 5% of sales: Diageo, Beam Suntory, Brown-Forman, Sazerac Company, Pernod Ricard

Margins are respectable and returns are near the top of the class, so hard to fault them here.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Constellation Brands, Inc. | $6,789M | 33% | 18%
Anheuser Busch Inbev SA (ADR) | $42,305M | 38% | 10%
Brown-Forman Corporation | $3,053M | 35% | 70%
Diageo plc (ADR) | $13,932M | 33% | 28%
Molson Coors Brewing Company | $3,505M | 23% | 4%

## Cash / Debt?

So perhaps the first concern is on the balance sheet... $STZ has $8,141M of net debt. That is 3.7x it's latest operating profit. Now this is a ""consumer staple"" so maybe we shouldn't worry that much and congratulate them on leveraging up in a low interest environment. Still, it's a flag. So beware!

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $179.56 for Constellation Brands, Inc. and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of just 8% to their target. Rather pedestrian that is. 

# Valuation

And at 26 times forecast earnings, it's understandable that Wall Street isn't punch-drink for $STZ. Though clearly Wall Street thinks the business has a better long-term outlook. Maybe that's driven by it's diversified portfolio and focus on the premium end of the drinks market?

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/stz/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
STZ | $33,490M | 26x | 17% | 1% | 4%
BUD | $204,276M | 34x | 6% | 3% | 6%
BFB | $19,431M | 27x | 5% | 1% | 7%
DEO | $71,718M | 21x | 8% | 3% | 8%
TAP | $22,381M | 32x | N/A | 2% | 5%

# Dividends

Constellation Brands, Inc. is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.59 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $1.33 per share. That is a 20% growth. The forecast dividend of $1.59 compares to a forecast EPS of $6.31, so plenty of room to increase the dividend when the debt burden declines. Though, they could alternatively start a buyback, as they have a $1bn authorisation.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 8% that compares with a no change in the earnings forecasts. On a 6 month perspective the stock's up 15% following the earnings upgrades up 17%. So nice to see a stock behaving!

That lack of price move in the last 3 months in despite the latest quarter seeing sales up 15%, driven by strong organic growth in their Mexican beer brands and from their recent acquisitions. 

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/stz/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, where the highlighted:

&gt; The beer business continues to target net sales and operating income growth in the range of 14% to 17%. We also continue to expect organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the 10% to 13% range.

Nice. Double digits! 

On top of that, they could benefit from a bit of trickery... as they are considering IPOing their Canadian wine business. They announced this in April. Who knows maybe someone will bid them for it, before the get to list it on the TSX?

And then there is their continued appetite to buy new brands. What gems can they add to portfolio? As they seem to do a pretty good job of developing brands after they buy them. :)

16-09-05,51akcc,What do I do? I want to start trading!,"Hi. 20 year old here who dropped out of college. I couldn't take it because of the math aspect (needed to take trig and calculus). Retook them both four times, and that was all I would of needed the graduate. Got fed up, and said to hell with it. 

I've been trading in the FOREX markets since I was 16, and after I dropped out in May, I went to FOREX trading full-time and I'm making a bit over $2500 every month, sometimes more. Not a great amount, but certainly livable. My dad is so disappointed in me, but I just couldn't do it. 

I hate working for other people anyway. I don't want to be someone's corporate slave, and since I was a teenager, I've learned how to make money on my own online. Started with trading in Team Fortress 2 and cashed everything out to start on FOREX (after using a demo). In addition,  I love statistics and graphology, and I read a ton. I enjoy what I am doing currently, however I want to start making big amounts. Again, I've been trading for years, but I switched to doing it full-time recently and I have more than enough saved up to risk. 

How can I get into stock trading? I want to get into it because I know what I am able to make will be far more than in the foreign exchange markets. I'm currently satisfied with how I am doing now, but while I think the FOREX markets are pretty generous if you know what you're doing, but there is only so much you can make with currency pairs. Not to mention, companies are so much more predictable.

What do I do? 

EDIT: I already have a great knowledge in companies, how they run and work, and I already track the markets, just haven't participated yet. ",0

The NYT tries to determine who is actually behind Anbang, the Chinese firm buying up billions of dollars of overseas properties and companies at a rapid rate, and who almost took over Starwood earlier this year. Pretty interesting investigation that raises further concerns (IMO) about what is really going on with some large Chinese firms. Generally, they find that much of Anbang's equity is held by people who are related to politically connected businessmen, do not at all seem to fit the mold of wealthy capitalists, and live and work in unusual places for such a massive company. The likely scenario is many of these individuals are proxy holders, which is not uncommon in China and obfuscates who is actually behind many firms (creating possible risk for investors, business partners, or nations where the firms operate).

Note Anbang is currently not publicly traded, but its insurance business is scheduled to be listed on the HK exchange this year.",29

16-09-05,51atmc,Sudden drop,"Hey.

I've got a question to ask, I hope I can get a proper answer.

I was checking out some stocks that are listed in the LSE and saw something interesting.

ICAG (International Consolidated Airlines Group S.A.) is the stock I'm talking about, have a look:

http://tr.investing.com/equities/intl.-cons.-air-grp-historical-data 

It opened @394.40, dropped to 139.10 at 14:54, then recovered to 393 a minute later, but LSE's website shows the low as 387.30. I checked the interactive graph provided by the LSE (http://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/prices-and-markets/stocks/summary/company-summary-chart.html?fourWayKey=ES0177542018GBGBXSET1)  by selecting ""today"" and ""bar"" and I can see the price drop, but it hasn't been reported as ""low"". Why? 

Here's an image : https://s12.postimg.org/rgqjorbcd/image1.png

Here's my question, is this something common in the LSE? As far as I know this never happens to a high volume stock, so I wondered. I haven't traded any foreign stocks so far and I know that sometimes a customer's accounts gets liquidated by a brokerage to cover some losses and the brokerage sell everything there is at any given price, no matter what.

Can it be something like this or is it a ""report"" of a short sale? (This sometimes happens on our stock exchange, but I don't know the LSE, so I asked.)",8
16-09-05,51ayi2,Gold and Oil,"Gold and oil are two of the most heavily traded commodities. It makes sense that they move together. They are both inflationary. They both tend to move inversely from the strength of the dollar. For these reasons, if oil goes on another run, gold could go up as well. 

Got this off an SA article and the charts tend to agree but only over long periods of time, spikes clearly have no correlation. 

If the trend is accurate and one were to believe that oil has reached its bottom for the year then now may be a great time to get on the gold train to funky town.

with a monthly paycheck I can affort to buy 5-7 of them after expenses. so I was wondering if it's something I need to be more ""expert"" before getting it into, or if I can get like a dozen of them over time and sell them when I feel like, with no much effort or external help.

(I want to point out that I'm already giving away a % of my paycheck for an end-terms fund, but I'm not getting any stocks or other bonuses from this %. they are just for when I'll get laid off and the company adds as much as I add (till a certain%)


I've seen some similiar topics but it's often with cheaper stocks like under 100$, I also don't think I'd be accused of Inside trading if for example I sell out my 10stocks before I know something is happening to the company and I have intention to leave before it anyway.

16-09-05,51bike,Combining Stock/Options on Conflicting Velocity Share Funds,"Note: My numbers may be a little off but I believe the concept and strategy still apply
Okay so I have come up with a strategy and I would like other people's input. I am looking at two stocks, DWTI and SCO. They are both bearish stocks for crude oil, but only SCO has an option available. They both move the exact same way, except DWTI is 3X and SCO is 2X. (Compare charts and you will see they move in identical patterns barring the price). These stocks are extremely volatile, so I am thinking of investing 90 percent into DWTI as a stock and then 10 percent into SCO as a put.

Let's take a scenario where I put $9000 into DWTI and $1000 into SCO. In only a little over one week, DWTI can drop about 40%, let's say from 110 to 65. This would mean my $9000 has now become $5400. However, during that same time, SCO would have dropped from 110 to 80. (These are real numbers, check from August 10 to August 19 of this year) If I had bought a put worth $1200 at 110 expiring in two weeks (the option itself at about 4 for example, even though I know it is actually cheaper), then the put would increase almost 8x in value to around $9600 if I'm not mistaken. Now I have $9600 and $5400 leaving me with a new portfolio worth 15000. I would constantly reinvest the put earnings into DWTI, and constantly readjust my put to be worth 10% of the total portfolio. So now let's say the markets go up the same value, DWTI going up from 65 back to 110 and SCO going back up from 80 to 110. Now my $13500 in DWTI would go up 69 percent to around $22815, and my put would lose all value, making me lose $1500 (10 percent of the $15000)

This example may be using extremes but I hope you understand the concept or strategy I am trying to demonstrate. I am thinking that no matter what, the gains I make from either the DWTI stock increasing or the SCO put decreasing will offset my 10% losses that I put into the put (it would only be a loss if the DWTI stock increases).

Thoughts?

*EDIT: The title is incorrect, they aren't actually conflicting but rather they are almost identical except for the 3X vs 2X amounts applied to them",2

16-09-05,519hc7,HANJIN Shipping and why you should care,"A few days ago, one of the world's top ten container carriers in terms of capacity filed for bankruptcy. HANJIN Shipping is South Korea's largest shipping company and its fleet consists of over 200 containerships, bulk carriers, and liquid natural gas carriers. 

Basically, HANJIN had applied for debt restructuring from its creditors back in April in order to avoid formal insolvency proceedings. 5 days ago, they filed for bankruptcy protection at the Seoul Central District Court after losing support from its banks. All of HANJIN's vessels are experiencing access issues to ports globally. Ports and other firms (Vessel leasers, longshoreman, pilot associations, stevedores, vessel crew management agencies, vessel crews, etc) are demanding arrears and prepayments before providing services to HANJIN vessels. 

HANJIN Shipping is the world's seventh largest container shipper and represents nearly 8% of the trans-Pacific trade volume for US markets.  By Thursday, three HANJIN container ships were offshore or anchored off the coast of Los Angeles (the US's largest port), a fourth that was supposed to leave remained anchored inside the breakwater. One ship in Singapore has already been seized and as of Friday, 27 ships had been refused entry to ports or terminals around the world.  This number will continue to grow sooner rather than later. Also, the crews aboard these vessels have enough food and fuel for a few weeks, but after that they'll run into humanitarian concerns and can be deserter risks aboard their vessels.  Leaving their vessels and cargo anchored offshore with no oversight.  I imagine this problem will only exasperate as time continues and nobody fills the void.  

When the world market is designed to get goods from point A to point B, on time, at the moment they're needed, what happens now?

It's been reported that the price per container rose from $1,100 to $1,700 from China to the US West coast as a result.

There's been a downward trend in terms of shipping rates due to weaker trade and overcapacity. Basically, the shippers built more and larger vessels that were conceived as cost-effective when freight costs were higher several years ago are no longer cost-effective when shipment fees aren't even covering the cost of fuel for the huge ships.  

These ships, with their cargo, whether onloaded/offloaded or waiting to be, are in a limbo status.  Think Tom Hanks from The Terminal. Nobody wants to touch them because they wont be getting paid for their work.  Right now, there are vessels sitting off coasts with an uncertain future. Cargo worth millions of dollars (hopefully non-perishable), is sitting idle, and manufacturers and consumers will eat the costs.  This could go on for months considering the complex legal hurdles related to dealing with every nation's bankruptcy laws around the world that HANJIN's vessels are currently sitting at or en route to.  

As of Monday, 79 Hanjin ships including 61 container ships and 18 bulk carriers have been denied port access, according to South Korea’s maritime ministry. Hanjin has 141 ships, of which 128 are operating.

Hanjin vessels are currently carrying cargo worth 16 trillion won ($14.5 billion USD) belonging to some 8,300 cargo owners, the Korea International Trade Association said, adding that the carrier has unpaid bills of 610 billion won.

Hanjin Shipping is part of Hanjin Group, which also owns Korean Air Lines Co., the world’s third-largest cargo airline. Korean Air loaned funds to Hanjin Shipping and bought shares in the container line in 2014 to become the biggest shareholder with 33 percent. The group, which also counts airport services, logistics and mineral water among its businesses, is headed by Chairman Cho Yang Ho.

LG Electronics, the world's second largest television manufacturer is one customer of HANJIN that is impacted as HANJIN had previously accounted for 15-20% of LG's deliveries to the US.

HANJIN last year had an impact to the Port of Portland- their ships accounted for 78 percent of the business at Terminal 6, moving 1,600 containers per week, providing about 657 jobs, paying out $33 million in wages per year. They closed their Portland operations last year.

**Points for discussion:**

* Is the house of cards falling?

* Is this a litmus test of the global economy?

* Will my Christmas presents be more expensive this year?

* What happens if more shipping companies go broke (even though so many are nationally incentivized)? 

* Why would the South Korean's let it fail?

Could be a possible shock wave into the markets in the near future.

Curious to know what others think. I am no global trade expert.",450

* Last year, I made ~$50k and contributed 5,500 to a traditional IRA w/ Vanguard.  It is now up to $6,300.  I was not eligible for my company 401k.

* This year, I will make $150k+ and will become eligible to contribute to my company 401k starting in October, which I plan on maxing out.

Now, what should I do with IRA contributions this year (I've not contributed at all yet)?  I'm trying to figure out the backdoor roth approach, but I'm having problems wrapping my head around it.  I *think* I'm reading that since I've already got a traditional IRA, that the backdoor roth may not be a good idea, and maybe not an option at all since I am edible to contribute to my companies 401k.

I'm reading as much as I can, but I'd appreciate some input on the matter.",1

I've done some researching on the Vanguard Website to see what further options are available and ran across the Brokerage Option Fund. With this option, I believe (correct me if I'm wrong), I would be able to pick individual stocks to contribute to my 403(b) plan.


I've been lurking on r/investing for a while and understand the risks if I were to choose this option. Companies I'm currently considering include John Bean (JBT), Long Term Care (LTC), Sherman Williams (SHW), Altria (MO), ect. (AKA companies with long histories of dividends and profit).


Is there anyone out there that has either considered this option or is currently participating in this option of a 403(B) plan? What information should I be aware of right off the bat besides the included risk of individual stock picking?

16-09-06,51dvxk,What are your estimates for JNUG 9/6 - 9/9?,"Hey WSBrs - I'm curious as to what you guys think Gold (and more specifically ETFs like JNUG that are derrived by the value of gold) will do tomorrow and over the week?

I've been bag-holding JNUG for about two weeks with an average cost-basis of $24.44 across 140 shares.  Picked it up as a hedge against a broader downturn in the market/play any corrections due to the trading season becoming active again, the US election in November and any other general fuckery.  I also have a reasonable amount of my portfolio in bond ETFs so that a rate hike benefits me as well.  

Bought 100 JNUG around $27 and picked up another 40 over the last week as gold puttered about/dipped prior to the fed meetings and jobs reports.  I should have opened with 40 shares and tapped 100 over the last week, but I didn't think JNUG would dip much more than $26 in the short-term and would return to ~30 within a week of the original purchase.  Buying closer to Labor Day would have been smarter.  
I know that you shouldn't hold 3x leveraged ETFs over any significant period of time, but JNUG has been doing alright--I'd be in really good shape if I'd bought shares 3 months ago and simply held!  $30 would have been my profit-taking mark in all scenarios.  Hindsight is a bitch, ain't it?

We had a catalyst/binary on Friday with the jobs report being ""okay"" and the Sept. rate hike from the Fed remaining in unlikely territory, which definitely has bumped gold up a bit.

I'd like to exit my JNUG position with a small profit (I figure that when gold is around 1343 I will be at break-even, depending on how that affects JNUG) and find a better re-entry point--unless there are compelling arguments 1) that gold to bump back up to the 1350s before it dips down below 1320 again (hold and sell higher) or 2) compelling arguments that gold will drop below 1300 before it bumps up to 1350 (sell now at a 12% loss to re-establish my average cost at a lower range).  I've only got about 5% of my portfolio in this position so I don't mind letting it ride.

So I hope others have this same lack of understanding WRT shorting. In contrast to the simplicity of buying when you think a stock will go up and then selling it when it does, how exactly does one trade expecting a stock to decrease in value?

Basically, I think I understand that you have to specify or buy an option valid within a certain time frame, and there are different prices or fees for different situations, etc. It is rather muddy to me still and I don't know where to start making simple trades to learn how. So when you see a stock like FITbit and think it is a fad and it will probably be worth less in 2 months, 6 months, etc. How do you turn that into a bet? Or if you saw twitter at $31 and thought that was hype, 6 mos later it is half that.. how would I have made a general bet on that?

16-09-06,51gzfn,A question on process of shorting,"Hello compadres,

So I hope others have this same lack of understanding WRT shorting or buying options/puts. In contrast to the simplicity of buying when you think a stock will go up and then selling it when it does, how exactly does one trade expecting a stock to decrease in value?

Basically, I think I understand that you have to specify or buy an option valid within a certain time frame, and there are different prices or fees for different situations, etc. But it is rather muddy to me still and I haven't gotten any simple instruction or don't know where to start making simple trades to learn how. So when you see a stock like FITbit and think it is a fad and it will probably be worth less in 2 months, 6 months, etc. How do you turn that into a bet? Or if you saw twitter at $31 and thought that was hype, 6 mos later it is half that.. how would I have made a general option contract to make money on that?

On top of that, it seems like computers are taking over and will in a not too distant future probably even put fundamental analysts out of business.

# Description
The Boeing Company is an aerospace firm with a commercial jet arm and a defense industry division. Sure there are other services on the side, but these are what count!

In fact over 70% of sales are from the commercial arm ($66bn v $30bn from defense) and over 60% of earnings from it ($5bn v $3bn from defence).



## Recent financials 

Over the last 5 years both sales and earnings have performed well. 

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $96bn | $91bn | $87bn | $82bn | $69bn|
|EPS | $7.44 | $7.38 | $5.96 | $5.11 | $5.33|

Though let's look at the two businesses, see the cause...

...clearly Commercial is doing well in terms of sales, and their backlog is beautiful, but it's not yet coming through in profits

|Commercial|2015A|2014A|2013A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Backlog | $431bn | $440bn | $373bn |
|Revenue | $66bn | $60bn | $53bn |
|Operating Profit | $5bn | $6bn | $6bn |

and the Defense business is treading water. 

|Defense|2015A|2014A|2013A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $30bn | $31bn | $33bn |
|Operating Profit | $3bn | $3bn | $3bn |

So where is the margin expansion coming from...

|Other line items|2015A|2014A|2013A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense | -$0.3bn | -$1.4bn | -$1.3bn |
|Other unallocated items and eliminations | -$0.7bn | -$0.8bn | -$-1.3bn |

Yes, the reversal of *funnies*. Not from the performance of the core business. 

And if you are wondering where the growth is coming from, it's not the US.

|Sales|2015A|2014A|2013A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|non-US | $57bn | $53bn | $49bn |
|US | $39bn | $38bn | $38bn |

## Competition
From their annual

&gt; The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share, such as Airbus, Embraer and Bombardier, and other entrants from Russia, China and Japan.

and in Defense, where there are lots of rules to ensure that ""enemies"" can't sell kit to the US govt, but that does stop the Europeans selling to the US, and they do a pretty good job of it.

&gt; we faces strong competition in all market segments, primarily from Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Company and General Dynamics Corporation. Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group, continue to build a strategic presence in the U.S. market by strengthening their North American operations and partnering with U.S. defense companies.

So with all the trappings of being the gorilla, what does it add up to... great returns but rubbish margins. Even the ragbag of a business Airbus manages a higher margin. 

So what's going on? Are they winning business v the other A&amp;D players by bidding too low? Is the heavily unionized workforce getting a larger share of the cashflow than at the competition?

## Cash / Debt?

Boeing Co has $1,750M of net debt. That is 0.3x it's latest operating profit. Which is rather low. Though given the way the aerospace business works with backlog, options on plane, etc. I wonder if this is a fair reflection of their liabilities.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $149.27 for Boeing Co and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 14% to their target.

# Valuation

And despite the core operations not looking to be growing much, Wall Street's got them on the highest PE ratio of all the US and the international peers. Okay it's got the best dividend and is good at generating cashflow, but is the forecast growth rate realistic, after so many good years?

# Dividends
Boeing Co is forecast to pay a dividend of $4.34 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $4.18 per share. That is a 4% growth. The forecast dividend of $4.34 compares to a forecast EPS of $6.31. On top of this they have a $14 billon share repurchase plan.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -1% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -26%. Ouch. So the stock's treading water, even though earnings are under pressure.

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ba/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers.

&gt; Our overall view of the business environment remains generally positive due to healthy industry fundamentals. Global passenger traffic continues to solidly outpace GDP, with IATA reporting 6% growth year to date. On the cargo side, the market remains sluggish with year to date freight traffic down approximately 1%.

So there is a nice secular growth story here for Commercial. And at the Defense arm

&gt; Domestically, the President's budget request for fiscal year 2017 advances key programs and we are anticipating a period of modest growth in defense spending over the next five years.

Were the charges that hit earnings in 2Q and caused the downgrades one off? From $7.44 a share in 2015 to $6.31 this year. With Wall Street expecting a bumper $9.64 in 2017. Well, if they can hit the Sept forecast of $2.63 a share in earnings and persuade us there are no more nasties coming in terms of charges, then yes. Perhaps the Wall Street optimism is justified.

So, a question to any long-term investor in $BA... are the one-offs really one of? Or do they have a habit of appearing regularly?

16-09-06,51g6rv,Different Ways to Trade Commodities,"Commodities are generally a foreign asset not many investors touch. However, these investment vehicles can be a powerful component in the goal of asset allocation.

First off, investors can get long in four different ways based on risk appetite...

For example, if you were bullish on gold you could trade by doing the following

1. Call a brokerage that allows you to invest in the physical commodity of gold. The notional value of gold bullion is around $130,200

2. Invest in GLD which tracks the price of gold closely. If the commodity is up 1% then GLD will tend to match that price. There can be slippage with ETFs.

3. Invest in a 2x or 3x etf on gold. This increased leverage makes upside greater but also downside greater. ABX is an example and the gains can be significant if traded right.

4. Sell a put option on GLD about 45 days out which tends to be the sweet spot. Doing this provides upfront income and the .16 delta gives a high probability of success.

Like I said, I'm new to MLPs. I do understand that they have complicated taxes, but I'm wondering why the yield is so good?

16-09-06,51gbpm,DD On the Brazilian Economy.,"We all know of Brazil's political mess, but not everyone knows how to make profit off of it, so here I am.

If you look at the Brazilian companies in the NYSE/Nasdaq, they are all indebted as fuck, and most of them are government-owned, due to Brazil's socialist leanings.

Regardless, the government did a shit job managing their companies, Petrobras is currently sitting at $125 Billion Debt, while their market cap is $60 Billion. Their revenue is currently on a free-fall, their profit is as well, everything is.

However, if the government does the obvious and sells the company to the Saudis after the OPEC, it might go up by north of 100% (Within a few months), and possibly kickstart the next oil boom (Which will happen regardless of anything else, so even if Petrobras isn't bought out, they are still going up). Thought this isn't a good company to ""INVEST"" (At least not on a 1-4 year term because of their debt), It's probably the best one to ""Flip"" (On 3-6 Months) due to the potential. (Saudis Buying, Brazilian government selling it, Oil booming)

Explanation on timing. My original intent was to wait until next Friday. But with spy down over 2 dollars today and a Monday buyback immanent I thought this was a good time to pull out. I will look for buyback opportunities if Spy jumps 2+ dollars Monday/Tuesday but otherwise won't buy back until after Yellen plays her monthly game.

OCUL has a CRL that is due sometime this month for the complete approval of Dextenza for post ocular inflammation due to cataract surgery, to resolve one remaining manufacturing deficiency. The stock has been great for swing trading the last month as it touched $4ish and at its highest around $8.56 with high intraday volatility. 

They also had an SEC filing for confidentiality treatment order on 8/31, not sure what it that entails but rumors seem to indicate a possible B/O according to the fags over at ST but we all know how their optimism operates, they seem think every Biotech is primed for a buyout. Apparently the CEO has experience with selling biotech companies. 

The CEO will be having a fireside chat at the Morgan Stanley Global Healthcare Conference on 9/12 at 4:15. Everyone is expecting bullish news, whether it full FDA approval, or potential buyout rumours.

**Gay analysts PT**

Low PT of 16, average PT of 32, and high PT of 60.

**Technicals**

From the 10 day chart, the Fibonacci retracement indicates a pivot and reversal so it should be on a steady uptrend past $6.86, with intraday resistance and support at 6.85 at 6.57 respectively. 

**Disclosure**

I’m about 1200 shares deep, been trading this stock for over a month. Holding out till it hits $12/share. I don’t know shit about TA.

16-09-07,51m2tc,"VolitionRX (VNRX) - Just announced product &amp; a number of catalysts in the next 2-3 quarters","Hi All,

I've been invested in and riding several waves of VolitionRX (VNRX), a company that has developed a highly accurate diagnostic platform to eliminate unnecessary tests and procedures.  They  just announced a colorectal cancer screening platform to be receive CE mark around 4Q2016, with full commercialization in 1Q2017.  The value of NuQ Colorectal Cancer Screening platform is to significantly eliminate the amount of patients referred to colonoscopies that have tested false positive on existing diagnostic tests.  You can learn more about the platform here:  http://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/stocktube/5810/volitionrx-limited-colorectal-cancer-screening-on-its-way-5810.html

I think there are a number of factors which may show that this company is a good investment opportunity.  Namely, they have a number of catalysts coming up in the next few months.  Second, diagnostic tests usually fall under a Class II medical device, paving the way for a relatively easy regulatory strategy.  Third, the company is under good leadership and is focused on staying lean and cost savings.

The main challenge is convincing governments to pay for these tests.  However, they have an experience Chief Marketing Officer that has launched several brands.  As the body of evidence builds up that a VNRX test will eliminate unnecessary referrals and procedures, countries are very likely to adopt and price the tests favorably. Therefore, I am med-long on VNRX.

16-09-07,51ixqu,High Arctic Energy Services (TSX) - What stocks are a better value? Based on a pure deep value based fundamental analysis.,"HWO on TSX is by far my largest holding and favourite stock. I've been buying and dripping since January, 2013. I challenge people to identify better values based on value investor metrics.

Here are the basic value stats to consider: P/B 1, Trailing, P/E 6.3, Forward P/E 6.5 (low end of estimates) D/Y 5% (can increase by dripping monthly), Buyback yield 10%, Payout Ratio 31%,FCF $50 million, FCF/share $1, FCF/payout ratio 19%, P/S 1, PEG 0.3 (high end estimate and based on past 3 year growth and adding at least 20% to sales over next 12 months at similar gross margin to current sales). 

Why does this stock trade at a such discount to the market? PE implies discount rate of 16% or roughly a 10% risk premium to the market, and yet the stock has a Beta of 0.817. Papau New Guinea instability risk (region is dependent on LNG growth and development unlikely to adopt anti business policies, resource minister on HWO board), large PNG contracts with 2 vendors represent 60% of revenue and risk of non-renewal (recently leaked in acquisition call that contracts likely to be renewed), Alberta slow down which effects 20% of their overall revenue mix, and long term downturn in oil and thus LNG prices and demand. If you do your DD you will find all these risks are manageable. The biggest is the dependence on a few customers and thus a significant bargaining power of its customers that HWO must contend with but they are (1) a niche service provider with an excellent track record that few firms can compete with on a qualitative basis and (2) are diversifying there operations. 

Thanks for reading and look forward to your input and suggestions for better values out there.",3

16-09-07,51k3pn,Puerto Rico defaults on first payment of $70 billion debt.,"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-idUSKCN0ZH5NI

From the article: 
&gt;Puerto Rico is not covered by Chapter 9 U.S. bankruptcy code

Who it's owed to
&gt;Some of the debt expected to be defaulted upon such as PBA (Public Building Authority) ex-series L bonds will be mostly covered by reserve funds held by the trustee bank. Nearly all of the payments due on the Puerto Rico Infrastructure Financing Authority (PRIFA) Bond Anticipation Notes (BANs) will be covered by reserve funds as well.

The article tries to dampen the issue a bit by noting that it's only defaulting on ~1/2 if its first payment of 2billion....But still note there is another ~$61 billion owed.

My question is do you think this will have any (not necessary major) influence on monetary policy i.e. the fed's decision to hike rates. Higher rates buts PR into deeper debt by making it harder for them to raise any more capitol to pay it off.

So add another reason to buy in the direction of no hike (JNUG, etc)

16-09-07,51n4oq,What is the point of buying stock long term? Mentality behind buying stock?,"So stocks with dividends i understand maybe because you get money from holding on to it (percentage of profits)

But for stocks that do not give dividends, what is the incentive of buying the stock?  (I know you can sell to other people and make money, but what is the underlying incentive that makes people buy it)  

A company can keep growing but ultimately the company could go bankrupt.  If you had stock from the beginning and held even 100 years and the company goes bankrupt you get nothing if the company doesn't give dividends.  

Is it really just gambling?  Just hoping they dont go bankrupt before someone else buys your shares at a higher price.. then they have to try to find someone that would buy it higher.. but why would that person buy it?  are they just gambling it to go higher and someone else buys it? I just do not understand how this got popular when the end game is someone will lose.  someone will end up buying the stock and not be able to sell it to anyone, so whats the point of it?

I would understand if a company reached a certain point or way before complete bankruptcy would sell off all their assets and give a percentage of that in ratio to how much shares you own (thereby you get the value of that share price that is almost equal). But a company would usually risk till the brink of bankruptcy when they have no more assets to give in worth compared to price of the stock.",0

(Source - https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Approximating_total_stock_market) 

What are your recommendations for a more aggresive allocation towards mid and small caps? Would a 75/13/12 mix be good or not enough to be worth it? Is this even a good idea? 26 years old with many years to go until retirement I feel more risk is better for me at this point.


Background:

$72,000/year salary

Maxing out Roth - $23k total

8% to 401k - $13k total


The funds in my 401k are very limiting, the only one that is worth it regarding the expenses is Fidelity's 500 index fund (FUSVX). I am using my Roth to diversify my portfolio while putting everything in my 401k into the 500 index fund.

401k Fund (percentages are portfolio-wide):

50% FUSVX (Fidelity 500 index fund)


Roth Funds:

??% FSCLX (mid cap index fund)

??% FSDSPX (small cap index fund)

25% FTIGX (International index fund)

10% FBDIX (US Bond index fund)

5% FRXIX (Real Estate index fund)

Any feedback to my strategy beyond what I have asked about would be appreciated. For example, am I putting to much towards bonds at 26? Are REITs a sound investment?

It may very well have saved her life, or at the very least the quality of her life. 

I think using the body's own immune system to fight cancer is a great idea and those companies developing drugs for this will stand to be on the front of the next big wave in the fight to win against cancer and that means profit profit profit. 

So this morning I put my money where my mouth is. I bought both ABBV and MRK. This isn't a day trade, it's an investment. Both stocks pay nice dividends in addition to the potential for growth as they market these immunotherapy drugs.

# Description
World Wrestling Entertainment is a media and entertainment company. The Company is engaged in the production and distribution of content through various channels, including its WWE Network, television rights agreements, pay-per-view event programming, live events, feature films, licensing of various WWE themed products, and the sale of consumer products featuring its brands. 

If you are male and over 5 years old, you don't need a description, do you. Though, you make be insulted that I call it a media company and not a sport. :)

## Recent financials 

So sales have been growing nicely, but earnings are rocky to put it kindly and the stock's paying more in dividends every year that it's earning? 

How does that work?

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $659m | $543m | $508m | $484m | $484m|
|EPS | $0.32 | -$0.40 | $0.04 | $0.42 | $0.33|
|DPS | $0.48 | $0.48 | $0.48 | $0.48 | $0.60|

## Competition

From their annual

&gt; While we believe that we have a loyal fan base, the entertainment industry is highly competitive and subject to fluctuations in popularity, which are not easy to predict. For our live, television, WWE Network, pay-per-view and movie audiences, we face competition from professional and college sports, other live, filmed, televised and streamed entertainment, and other leisure activities. We compete with entertainment companies, professional and college sports leagues and other makers of branded apparel and merchandise. We will face increased competition from websites and mobile and other internet connected apps delivering paid and free content, as streamed media offerings continue to expand. 

So given it's entertainment, it's competing for the same dollars as any other type of entertainment. But as history shows, they've done a pretty good job protecting their brand and keeping the audience loyal.

Talking a look at ""peers"" from the production and broadcasting industries, their margins are healthy and the returns are double-digit. So no red flag here.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. | $703M | 17% | 11%
Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. | $7,747M | 8% | -ve
Madison Square Garden Co | $1,115M | 4% | -ve
Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. | $2,086M | 0% | 6%
Eros International plc | $274M | 61% | 1%
Starz | $1,666M | 69% | 99%
Discovery Communications Inc. | $6,472M | 62% | 14%
AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc | $3,003M | 16% | 7%
Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc. | $3,338M | 44% | 47%

And the balance sheet looks line with $49M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 3% of the market value of $WWE.
# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $22.39 for World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 7% to their target.

# Valuation

But, even though the franchise and financials are rosy, it's a little worrying to see the stock on 44x earnings. Sure the growth's been good. But how is it doing to grow into that valuation? Where's the growth going to come from? Is international finally going to take off?

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/wwe/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|

SNI.O | $8,153M | 12x | 11% | 2% | 15%

# Dividends
World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.48 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $0.48 per share. That is a 0% growth. The forecast dividend of $0.48 compares to a forecast EPS of $0.48. Phew... so this year earnings are expected to catch up.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 16% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 4%. With sales up 13% in the first half of 2016.

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/wwe/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers.

&gt; Over the second-half of '16 we anticipate year-over-year adjusted growth in profits from continued revenue growth and more favorable year-over-year comparisons in our fixed cost base. We anticipate such growth will accelerate in the fourth quarter.

So the future is bright in management's eyes!

16-09-08,51p3si,Index Fund vs Individual Stocks in Brokerage Account,"I'm looking for guidance in regards to utilizing an index fund vs individual stocks in my brokerage account.  I'm 28 years old and I have a fully funded emergency fund, contribute 5% to my 401k to receive the full company match, and I invest $458 a month to my Roth IRA to reach the full $5,500 limit. After all of my retirement contributions and my monthly expenses I still have around $1,000 left at the end of each month.  I want to retire early, so I know maximizing a brokerage account is important.  I currently have $2500 invested in Under Armour (UA). I was thinking about picking around 8 individual stocks and investing my left over $1,000 each month.  I would also go long on all of these stocks and not sell any for several years. The 8 stocks I had in mind were the following: 
1) Under Armour (UA)
2 Facebook (FB)
3) Activision Blizzard (ATVI)
4) Salesforce.com (CRM)
5) Disney (DIS)
6) Visa (V)
7) Nvidia (NVDA)
8) Constellation Brand (STZ)

Obviously since my goal is to reach retirement early I'm focusing on growth stocks instead of dividends.  Individual stocks excite me, but the little voice in my head reminds me over and over again that it's near impossible to beat the market.  That's why I think I know deep down I need to invest my extra $1,000 each month in an index fund such as the Fidelity 500 Index (FUSEX).  My brokerage account is with Fidelity.  Is the overall long term smart decision to go with the index fund?

I knew (and I'm sure most people knew) that the moment they announced Mario's name, Nintendo stock would surge. 

Certainly, the surge was more than expected, but the existence of the surge was definitely expectable. I bought in at 30.5 and sold at 35, good enough of a win for me especially since I almost never day trade.

I expected it to surge to 35, and drop back down to 32 or so and level off, while slowly gaining momentum over time. 

However, it ended today at 36, which I didn't think would happen. Is this because the expectation of Nintendo is different from merely hype?

For example, Nintendo revealing their presence on mobile technology shows a big move towards a new platform of gaming which may revolutionize platform gaming, especially with Nintendo's prowess in handheld gaming. This kind of reputation coupled with the popularity of mobile gaming makes people extremely excited... so they continue supporting Nintendo in order to encourage further mobile development.

Would you agree with this summarized analysis? What do you think would happen.

So for example, when the economy is good, people are more likely to buy the durable goods that they need to replace. The exact opposite happens during a recession.

So my question is, would it be a good idea to trade companies that sell durable goods based on how the economy is doing? That is short them during a good economy and trade them regularly during a bad economy?

Morningstar rated their fee level as ""low"" and a 0.75 expense rate didn't seem too excessive with the limited offerings from American Funds. I'm pretty new to investing, so that was pretty much all I thought about it. I've been investing a bit in my IRA, but my full  401k match I fired and forgot the AAHTX.

I recently learned about load and Class A shares (I had assumed it was similar to Nike Class A or B stock) and am wondering how much it really affects my long term earning possibility in a fund. Morningstar puts the load of AAHTX at 5.75. If I put 100 or dollars a week (with match) into that fund, what portion goes toward the load? How should I weigh load vs fees when considering funds from the limited slate my 401k offers?

EDIT: To clarify, I am paying up to my match on my 401k and above that into an IRA.  Also did more research as suggested and the fund option is an R3, so I should not be paying a load on that. Thanks for the help!",2

Please do your own do diligence on any stock before purchasing!

Pepsi’s dividend is extremely safe, and at a 3% yield its worth picking up. We are comfortable with Pepsi’s ability to continue paying its dividend and expect ~7% annual dividend growth over the next few years. Pepsi is expensive on traditional valuation metrics, and like many of the dividend stocks has been bid up by income focused investors and low interest rates. Pepsi’s payout ratio (this is the amount they pay to investors in dividends compared to the amount they actually earn, lower is better) should remain in the 60% range. Pepsi has been raising its dividend for over 25 consecutive years, its a great brand that will still be a great brand when your daughter is 25+.

We also like Macy’s, although it is a bit hairier than Pepsi, the thesis with Macy's is you get a solid growing dividend, and a great real estate portfolio which could be sold for extra valuel. This story partially played somewhat as management announced they would close 100 stores and selloff the excess real estate, the stock moved up about 17% that day. We think there is more upside in the real estate and still see a rising dividend as likely. Macy’s yield is down from the 4.5% yield at the start of August but we still think its attractive at 3.6% as of the end of August. Macy's payout ratio is 45% and has been raising its dividend every year over the past 12 years.

Finally, we like Whole Foods Mart, even though the company has seen investor sentiment turn away from them.Lower earnings and a slowdown in same store sales and store growth has kept investors negative on the name. Still, we think WFM management is strong, and the business is much stronger in terms of margins than its grocery store peers. The dividend is quite low at only 1.7% but we expect this to continue growing. WFM also repurchases a lot of shares, which is another form of capital return.

But...we agree with Warren Buffet, and suggest most investors buy a basket of stocks, which can be purchased via an ETF. Why buy one Dividend stock where a single bad event can impair your capital for a long long time. When you can buy a whole bunch like with the [S&amp;P500 Dividend Aristocrat Index](http://smartdividendstocks.com), this offers diversification, a decent dividend, and the safety of owning 50 of the best stocks in the world.",0

16-09-07,51ly4x,PSA: Buying vs. Selling Options - Initial Position,"Let's talk for a second about initial entry positions and their possible exits. This is an attempt to ""Make /r/WSB Great Again""

If you don't understand the acronyms below, Google them. TL;DnR is at the bottom.

I see many folks buying OTM options, especially call options. An option has two value components: intrinsic and extrinsic.

ITM Options have intrinsic value. OTM have zero intrinsic value. 

Extrinsic value represents a combination of time and volatility, on both ITM and OTM options. The greater the DTE the greater time is the driving component of extrinsic value.

When purchasing an option, you *MUST* pay what the seller *ASKS*. While you may set your limit bid the sale will not occur until you meet the seller's ask price. He may lower his ask price, but **he is the price setter** and **you are a price taker**.

When you purchase the option you are buying only what the seller believes is the extrinsic value of the option. You need three out of three events to happen for you to be *likely* be profitable: direction and time or volatility. You make get the direction right, but if too much time passes, you may not be profitable. If you get direction right but volatility collapses, you may not be profitable. If you get the timing right, but direction is wrong you may not be profitable.

Even if you get direction, volatility, and time right, you need a buyer that to exit the position. [While you could certainly exercise the position, many here do not have the BP for that. Therefore, this is beyond the scope of this post.] As you wait for the buyer to appear, that confirms the direction (intrinsic), volatility (extrinsic), and time (extrinsic), time continues to tick, decaying your position. You may not find confirmation of the time value in the option contract.

Circling back to the OTM call option (a.k.a. ""The Lottery Ticket""). You need three out of three value components to be profitable and for a buyer to confirm them when you sell. That's asking a lot from the market.

The opposite of buying the option would, obviously, be selling options. As an initial **price setter** you dictate the extrinsic value will be. While someone may not buy at that price, it usually means you were wrong in determining value. You need to go back to the drawing board and figure out why. There are a million reasons why this could be.

Now, if someone buys your option that you sold you need to be right about direction. Depending on the DTE, volatility could be the larger component of extrinsic value and volatility make spike in the interim. This may result in **unrealized** losses. However, as DTE become fewer, time becomes the greater driver of extrinsic value. As time continues passing, volatility becomes less of a factor and extrinsic value continues to erode with intrinsic value becoming the driving force. With 0 DTE, the option is a function of intrinsic value.

Attempting to exit the position, you can try to buy it back but you become a **price taker** again. If you like the price you can buy it back. If not, you can wait and let the time pass. You do not need a buyer to **realize** a profit.

Options get increasing more complicated when deciding between strikes, DTE, and calls v puts. While calls and puts can be bought and sold to create identical pay off diagrams, this is only relevant in theory. In real markets, there needs to be a buyer for every seller. *At the end of a trade, don't be searching for a buyer.*

16-09-08,51py7l,eSports Investing: Is it a good idea?,"For those of you who do not know what exactly eSports is, it is a form of competition that is facilitated by electronic systems, particularly video games.

What is most impressive about investment opportunities is that eSports are still in their infancy. While already boasting fan numbers in the hundred millions, eSports viewership is expected and projected to continue to grow, reaching nearly 150 million viewers before the end of the decade. While major companies like Coke, Nissan, and Red Bull have already joined as sponsors, the possibilities for investments are endless. In addition, Amazon purchased Twitch, an online community for gamers. The number of fans, the number of opportunities, and the number of gamers seem to be ever-growing.

The biggest concern for investors is profit. eSports gaining fans is a good sign, but perhaps more so are the players’ earnings. In ESPN’s report, the winner of the DOTA2 Champions won $5 million in 2014. The only champions earning more were from the Super Bowl, who are players already on million dollar salaries, and the World Series of Poker. In addition, of the top eight sport championship earners, four of them were from eSports.

If nothing else, eSports provide an enormously public platform. Because games are easily viewable online, the numbers grow much faster than other sports. In addition, one article from CNBC pointed out that the only thing eSports needs to do to grow is continue to play new games. While professional sports leagues institute rule changes or bring up new expansion teams to make the game seem newer, eSports simply need to play released games from an already profitable industry. The article also pointed out that the Internet has brought together an industry of gamers, who have been connected since gaming became a trend. Imagine the possibilities for people who live their whole lives with both video games and the internet.

What’s perhaps the best thing about eSports is that it truly requires a skillset. While people may find themselves beating their friends at video games, when one looks at the eSports world they can see how talented each professional gamer is. If nothing else, eSports is certainly an entertaining outlet for its audience.

16-09-08,51ro6l,[Meta] App Day/Vendors Day - We want the community to weigh in on an idea,"***tl;dr: We get a lot of spam and self-promotion crap that we remove. We remove all of it without exceptions, but sometimes we think that something we removed is something you might have liked. Rather than open the floodgates to all ""self-promotion"" we're thinking of having a semi-regular scheduled topic where we allow this kind of content just in that one topic. Then the community can vote on it, and discuss it.***

/r/Investing does not like spammers. /r/Investing does not like self-promotion. We see that in the reports we get on posts, and when it gets past us the usual downvotes the topic gets. We've been (pretty) good about keeping that stuff out. We fell behind about a year ago because of a lack of active moderation and we brought on a whole new set of people to help fill in the holes (Thank you /u/jperras, /u/Fletch71011, /u/MasterCookSwag, and /u/nows for helping out so much lately. It's been night and day since you all joined).

However, we have a concern on our minds. On a regular basis we get a modmail from someone asking if they can post something self-promotional, but this person feels that their ""thing"" might be pretty good:

* A new app they are developing - the quality of which, in our opinion, wildly varies. These are always denied. 

* Some little tool they developed on their own website (branded or unbranded, paid or unpaid). These are always denied. 

* Someone asking if they can announce something like a course, or conference (paid or unpaid). Denied. 

* A very small operation asking if they can get ""feedback"" on their website/app. Deeenied. 

Now, we're not dumb, we know what ""getting feedback"" means. Mod /u/nows did a napkin-math calculation in modmail and the value of being on our frontpage of /r/Investing is probably around $200 in advertising dollars. Maybe it's worth more. People want to post about their product here. 

However, sometimes the modteam feels that when we deny a post we could potentially be denying something that the community is interested in. With these Yale courses we allowed it because it's Yale, even if it's ""technically"" promotional in nature. We also had a post ""slip through our fingers"" once in the recent past and it was HEAVILY upvoted despite including a website URL for what seems to be someones personal brand - https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/4qxjr6/ive_processed_1tb_of_secs_data_to_extract/. We have some solid proof that you all might actually be interested in something that is ""technically against the rules"". These are rare exceptions of good stuff compared to the much larger pile of removed crap - but it's hard to tell what might be good here. 

In /r/Android people are absolutely allowed to post things they made. Tools, courses, apps they made, and even just updates to their apps. The community there loves it. Meanwhile over here we basically have a blanket ban on the whole topic, (almost) no exceptions. **It seems like we sometimes seem to be holding back content that the community MIGHT otherwise enjoy.**

We have some concerns though. **We don't like the idea of someone ""using"" /r/Investing to post what should have been just an advertisement, and collect a fistful of installs/email addresses/traffic from the community. Therefore I am not proposing a change to the self-promotion/spam rules in this community.** You all continue to report, downvote, and remove most stuff that we missed and should have been removed quicker. It's just that SOMETIMES there is a diamond in that pile of shit. This is a big problem for us - we don't want to be the ""Mod Gods"" who get to decide what kind of content is a diamond, and what is shit. Therefore we don't want to start to give regular exceptions to stuff that we like, and continue to remove stuff that seems like the usual bull. We'd rather have a method that allows the community to decide what is good and what is bad without blanket allowing all spam/self-promotion.

**My idea would be to have a semi-regular post where some of the bets are off with respect to the ban on self-promotion.** Top-level comments would be self-promotional, and then the community would reply to those/vote on them. This topic would be temporarily stickied and it would be scheduled far in advance. We would inform anyone looking to post their ""thing"" here that they should wait for the next topic. This topic would be restricted to 1) things that relate primarily to investing and 2) tools, apps (web, phone, computer), programs, API's, events, courses, or similar. Blogs and mailing lists would not be allowed. 

The community would have the chance to look at this topic, look at some of the things that are available for their use, and comment back. Any app that is trash can get downvoted and not earn much attention. The mods don't need to filter the offerings or anything like that. The topic would hopefully get a fair amount of attention though in order to entice vendors to post their thing. 

Another option is to have a day under the same conditions, but each ""thing"" could have it's own post. This could potentially be less clutter and easier to browse than a topic and give more incentive for vendors/individuals who made something to get involved. However, it might result in a lot of new posts in the subreddit that day and otherwise swamp the other discussions going on that day.

**We want comments from the community on:**

* Is this a good idea, or bad idea? Do you disagree with anything I said above? 

* Do you think we should do it as a semi-regular single topic, or a semi-regular day where individual ""promotional"" topics are allowed?

* How regularly? Right now anything from quarterly to yearly has been discussed among the modteam. 

* Do you agree with the list of what would be allowed? Is there anything that should be removed or added? 

*1) things that relate primarily to investing and 2) tools, apps (web, phone, computer), programs, API's, events, courses, or similar. Blogs and mailing lists would not be allowed.*",13

Investors are expecting that 2016-2017 will be another period of stagnation for iPhone sales and profits. Hence the drop in Apple's suppliers' stock prices. TSMC fell 0.3% after Apple announced the iPhone 7 and they are the sole supplier of the new A10 CPU that powers the iPhone 7 --&gt; a sign that investors think that the iPhone 7 sales will either hit or miss expectations, not exceed. 

Most are expecting something massive in September 2017, most likely VR. 

AAPL is either a hold or sell for now. The best time to buy is probably early-mid 2017 when the markets settle after the November US Presidential Elections. ",4

16-09-08,51s9bg,Editas with Bill Gates $EDIT,"If you have been paying attention to biotech news you are probably aware of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology that has been making headlines recently. For those that aren't the quick explanation is that there is a protein in bacteria called Cas9, this protein uses an RNA strand as a guide to cut DNA. Why this is useful for researchers is that it allows genes to be quickly knocked out of cells as the repair of the DNA cuts in the cells aren't always perfect leading to a loss of the gene (commonly this happens around 30% of the time). CRISPR-Cas9 has useful applications in medicine as you can knock out genes that code for proteins that are the cause of disease, rather than modifying the protein through the application of a small molecule drug. The knockout of the protein is also permanent so you will only need the treatment once. As such there is a lot of hype around rushing this technique to the clinic.

""But those investments are dwarfed by today’s announcement, which will put $120 million into the tiny company’s bank account – enough, Editas says, to keep it running for a projected three years.

Both Editas and Gates’ office confirm that the Microsoft MSFT -0.49% billionaire, who is the world’s richest man, is among the bng0 backers.""

I have a lot of conviction in this approach and like the lower drawdown associated with these types of approaches.

I'm considering SGENX.  It follows the approach but also holds some gold.  The expense ratio is a bit high, but 'below average' (the fund is available without load at schwab).  The managers have over $1 million personally invested in the fund (funds with manager investment have higher tendency of beating benchmark).

Also considering MOAT ETF with some bonds.  My concern is the mere 20 holdings and no international exposure.

Any other funds out there I should consider?

16-09-08,51sr3c,Army handgun contract and SWHC. Need some opinions on a potential trade.,"I don't actually follow SWHC and never thought about investing in them before. But... Today someone spent 20 grand on 29.00 strike calls that expire next Friday. Could just be a YOLO bet or someone closing their open calls, but it seems suspicious to me nonetheless. No other strike price saw a movement, so *if* someone is betting on SWHC, they're betting on a very specific time and price. That time being within a week from now. 

After I saw this 20 grand bet go down, I bought 20 Sep16 29.00 strike calls. It's a straight gamble that I'll most likely lose 100% on, but for $400 I don't mind too much. 

When do you think the army will make an announcement? Is SWHC still in contention for the final 3? The army is already overdue from their initial deadline of August 31st, and I don't see an announcement on the [DoD page](http://www.defense.gov/News/Contracts) about anything significant.

I sold three contracts for a stock I own 300 shares of, what is known as a covered call. For this I received a credit of $345. Now if the stock remains below the strike price it will expire OTM. Which is best case scenario, I keep the credit and the shares. 

But it could also expire ITM and I have to sell all 300 shares at the strike price. **Which Im fine with.** My question is, and this is what I could not find in any of the articles I read, do I still get to keep the initial $345? Is there a catch Im missing? 

I know there would be unrealised gains and I would miss out on whatever the stock goes too past the strike price, but I still get to keep the $345 right? Is there something with taxes where I'm taxed on whatever the stock is worth that could negatively affect the original credit? Since the $345 is just a credit is it removed from my account in relation to some sort of time decay once the option is assigned? Like I originally received $345 but I lose $100 because the stock rose so much? 

TL/dr: Im fine with unrealised gains, I just want to keep my initial credit from selling the calls. I get to keep that no matter what right?

My plan is to begin a monthly contribution where I purchase at 50% margin (there is a brokerage offering ~2% rates here). This should push me significantly out of the range for a margin call as this security is eligible for 30% margin.

I am curious if there can be a discussion regarding what I need to be careful of when investing in this manner; I have not touched any leveraged strategies before. I have over 20 years for an investing horizon.

25.84% 7-10 yr US Treasury

10.46% Emerging Market Bond

10.2% COMEX Gold

9.8% International Treasury Bond

8.47% 20+ yr US Treasury

4.42% Vanguard FTSE Pacific

4.03% Global Real Estate

**BAD:**

1) Shitty phone nobody needs. Dismal sales numbers so much so they won't even release numbers for it. 


2) No chance against chinese companies making better phones at half the price and it's only going to get more competitive. No chance in India where a great phone can be had for 150.00.


3) Ecosystem is dead. Apps is over. I haven't bought an app in so long and I own both platforms.


4) Apple cannot produce anything comparable to google/microsoft in big data space. Machine learning? no. Voice recognition/digital assistant? no. Decent maps? Don't make me laugh. Self driving cars? Are you fucking kidding me??? I wouldn't trust their engineers. VR/AR? Good luck with that. They don't have the raw R&amp;D knowhow for this.


**GOOD:**

1) Bunch of money they are going to use to do buy backs so their execs can cash out their stock. This is short lived strategy.


**SUMMARY**


En fin, nothing on horizon. The best they had, iphone 7, is a dud. The gravy train on apple is over. Look at the technicals. It's down down down. Lots of people have made tremendous gains and will take their winnings now that market value is plummeting.


SELL SELL SELL. You can buy back in a year when the hype for iphone 8 comes out. Till then, it's all misery.


Ok, off to listen to my sweet $1000 shiny black iphone 7 in its big ass case cause it scratches like a motherfucker. Just need to find the damn 200 dollar ear buds which used to be free. Found 1, can't find the other. :/ Don't worry though cause now I have my ceramic watch thing to occupy me and show people how sweet I am. did I tell you it's ceramic not metal??? I'm glad apple is innovating... ",107

16-09-08,51tj3g,GameStop - Coming to a Stop?,"I purchased GME shares in early summer, lured by good dividends and my own intuition of them being undervalued.  I then while the stock was on the rise, doubled my shares raising my stock average to $28 and change, certain that between the combination of (Pokemon Go's Hype/Sales and the previous sales that were to be accounted for in the upcoming Sept Quarter) they would find themselves nestled back in the low to mid thirties in a few weeks and the rise in my average wouldn't have much effect.

Clearly this wasn't the case, and the stock has taken a hit back into the high twenties following the report.  So for those of you currently holding GME or speculating I am looking for your thoughts as I find myself at a crossroad. I don't mind holding, because of the 5% divi and am predicting a better outlook for Nov/Dec, but should I grow weary of falling attached to a stock who's business plan is now under attack? How much, if any, of GME's current downward trend is related to the September Blues? Do you see the introduction of Nintendo's latest mobile release as another dagger into the dependance on physical sales GME relies on or as a possible future symbiotic relationship, given that GME is now not only relevant in the gaming industry, but also diversifying into the secondary sales market of mobile phones? Furthermore, do you think Apples release of the iPhone7 will churn up these secondary sales enough to start vindicating GME's new business ventures? 

TL;DR Is Gamestop's Brick and Mortar way of life coming to an end, or do they have what it takes to right the ship and adapt with the change in time? ",9

A [few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/4x4ql9/stockaday_we_are_experimenting_with_etfs_voo/) we asked if we should try writing on ETFs. And $VNQ came up as the next one to look at. So here goes!

|Ticker|[VNQ](https://stockflare.com/stocks/vnq)
|:---:|:---:|
Sector | Exchange Traded Funds
Latest price | $90.77
Value | $36 billion
Daily vol | $328 million
Date | 7 Sept 2016

### Useful Links
* Latest analysis from [ETF.com](http://www.etf.com/VNQ) and [ Morningstar](http://www.morningstar.com/etfs/ARCX/VNQ/quote.html)
* Latest [S&amp;P500 data](http://www.multpl.com/)
* Website: [vanguard.com](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundIntExt=INT&amp;FundId=0986)

# Description

* Invests in stocks issued by real estate investment trusts (REITs), companies that purchase office buildings, hotels, and other real property.
* Tracks the MSCI US REIT Index, a gauge of real estate stocks.
* High potential for investment income and potential for some growth in capital

# Efficiency / Fees

So VNQ's cheaper in fees than iShares and SPDR, but it's Schwab's REIT ETF that's got the lowest fee and the lowest tracking error. 

|Metrics|Expense Ratio| Tracking Error|Uses Derivatives|Stock Lending Fees|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Vanguard's REIT $VNQ | 0.12% | -0.16% | No | 100% to Fund :) |
|iShares' $IYR | 0.44% | -0.52% | No | 70% to Fund :/ |
|iShares' $ICF | 0.35% | -0.40% | No | 70% to Fund :/ |
|SPDR's $RWR | 0.25% | -0.30% | No | 100% to Fund :) |
|Schwab's $SCHH | 0.07% | -0.14% | No | 100% to Fund :) |
| | | | | |
|Vanguard's S&amp;P500 $V00 | 0.05% | -0.04% | No | 100% to Fund :) |

Oh, and unsurprisingly it's more expensive that the plain old S&amp;P 500 ETF.

# Asset Allocation

Obviously it's all invested in REITs! And it's tracking the MSCI index nicely. And if we look at that allocation relative to Schwab's SCHH, Vanguard is a little lighter on Residential / Offices and heavier on Specialized / Diversified. Note: SCHH is tracking the Dow Jones Select REIT Index, not the MSCI index.

|ETF| VNQ | Index | SCHH |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Retail REITs | 25% | 25% | 26%|
| Specialized REITs | 16% | 16% | 11%|
| Residential REITs | 15% | 15% | 19%|
| Office REITs | 13% | 13% | 16%|
| Healthcare REITs | 13% | 13% | 13% |
| Diversified REITs | 8% | 8% | 2% |
| Industrial REITs | 6% | 6% | 7% |
| Hotel &amp; Resort REITs | 5% | 5% | 6% |

Though if we look at the actual REITs in VNQ v SCHH, 8 of the top 10 holdings overlap with 34% of VNQ in it's top 10 holdings and 43% of SCHH.

Unsurprisingly the performance of VNQ to SCHH isn't that different. 

| Annualized | 1 Year | 3 Year | 5 Year |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| VNQ | 31.3% | 16.6% | 14.1%|
| SCHH | 29.7% | 16.7% | 13.8%|


# Valuation

When it comes to valuation, let's compare the Vanguard REIT ETF with Vanguard's High Dividend Yield ETF and the S&amp;P500 one.

Here's where I struggle... with VNQ and any actual REIT itself. They are trading at a huge PE premium to the S&amp;P 500, even though the net-yield is the same. Sure historically earnings growth has been amazing, but is that sustainable? 

|ETF| VNQ | VYM | VOO |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|No. of stocks| 150 | 424 | 505 |
|Median size| $12bn | $125bn | $85bn |
|PE ratio| 37x | 21x | 22x |
|Earning growth | 18% | 1% | 7% |
| Dividend Yield | 2.3% (**net**) | 3.1% | 2.1%|

NOTE: the dividend yield for VNQ is 3.4% on a **gross** basis, but given there are taxes to be paid, we show the the estimated net figure in the table.

And if I wanted a high dividend, surely the 3.1% from the VYM would be a nice alternative, albeit it with little to no growth.

# Well?

So looking my 3 top questions for any ETF:

1. Am I happy with the asset itself?
2. Am I happy with this specific strategy?
3. Am I happy with the provider of the ETF?

1. Well, no, I'm not happy with the asset class: real-estate via a tax structured vehicle. At the current valuations both PE and yield, it seems like a lot is already priced in. Plus at 150 stocks with average market value of just $12bn I wonder what happens in a liquidity crunch. 

2. In terms for the specific strategy of having increased real-estate exposure by adding VNQ to my portfolio. I can't see any fault in that. For anyone who rents (i.e. you are short the real-estate market) perhaps putting some of you savings into VNQ is a ""hedge"". Or maybe you are a property bug? Though I doubt property bugs buy REIT ETFs. They prefer to own the deeds directly, in my limited experience.

3. And the provider, well as usual, I am a fan of Vanguard. However, in this case, I can see merits in considering Schwab's SCHH instead. 

## Feedback

So, how'd we do? This any use as a stockAday post? Thanks for the feedback.

#EDIT
 
Please see the comments below re:taxes and yield. It seems that the gross yield of 3.4% is the figure to look at if you hold VNQ in a tax efficient account. Though I am still digging as to how we should look at REITs, as the tax impact is pretty important.

Now I'm seeing mixed opinions from people saying $AMD is garbage because of the newly diluted shares announcement and to ""sell sell sell"", and other people yelling out ""Buy the dip! The rocket's still going strong!""

So what's up? Why has almost everyone been going crazy for months over this stock? I did like 5 minutes of research and can't find anything worthwhile about the company except for somethings about Zen, that has more than likely been priced in already.

* It has a negative P/E of -7.11
* It's EPS is -0.43
* Trading at 5x book value
* High long term debt
* Profit margins have declined,
* Has been consistently losing money for years at an accelerating rate.
* Up until the recent drop, has been trading very near 52wk highs
* Negative ROE

So with all of the above being listed, why does WSB generally love $AMD so much and believe it to be the miracle stock, destined for interstellar travel? What am I not seeing here guys?

http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/06/09/how-to-tell-when-the-stock-market-is-on-sale/

And was thinking about the P/E ratio of the overall market, especially with his comment:

""a detailed statistical analysis of the market history shows that if you can buy the stocks when they are on sale way below 16.4, your next 10-20 years of investment returns are unusually good. If you buy when it is way higher than 16.4, you are likely to get lower-than-average returns.""

So I googled ""s&amp;p 500 P/E ratio"" and some sources show it to be around 25 right now, but the P/E ratio of $VTI is 15 and the P/E ratio of $SPY is 19.

I don't want to debate the blogger's advice over whether it's good to ""time the market"" and buy when P/E ratio is &lt; some number, I know there's a lot of spirited debate around the internet as far as that goes. I'm just wondering if anyone has a good explaination for why the P/E ratio is different for the ETF's that track the index vs. the index itself?

I'm probably missing something fundamental about indexes or ETF's or P/E ratio's but please educate me!

Thanks!",3
16-09-09,51whd8,Do options ever get exercised before due date?,"Options of the American type can be exercised any time, however a option in the money with a due date in the future will have a higher value than the distance to the market (distance to market + premium). However the price you can get for it might not reflect that because there might not be a willing buyer, especially for lesser traded options. So one might exercise the option at a loss so to speak (because one would not get paid the premium that should be valued in).
Now this is all theoretical, and I wonder if any of you have ever exercised options before due date or have had options you sold exercised before due date irl.

16-09-09,51wwms,"What AAPL's share price will look like from now through 2017-2018","These are not my predictions, but my friend's (who is a former stock broker and now investment banker)

1. AAPL's stock price will likely plunge another 10% from now through September 2017. He sees AAPL's stock price being boxed in the $90~$95 support level within 6 months. 
Rationale: Apple's iPhone 7 wont sell well and this is justified by low parts orders by Apple's part suppliers/contractors. 

2. Samsung currently has an edge in hardware innovation over Apple. The public perceives Samsung's products to be more technologically advanced due to its curved OLED technology. 
He thinks that Apple's contract to buy 100 million Samsung OLED displays in 2017~2020 was a good decision for the AAPL stock price. He thinks that this change has the potential to send AAPL stocks soaring to at least $120~$130. 

3. AAPL's stock price from 2017-2018 may or may not look very different from now according to these variables:

a) if Apple releases something revolutionary, such as the highly speculated VR product, then the stock price may become very volatile depending on its success. If public reception is poor, stocks could sink further into the $74~$80 support level last seen in early 2014. 
If public reception is positive, he sees AAPL potentially reaching above and beyond the May 2015 peak of $133. 

b) If Apple does not release a VR product/something revolutionary, the stock price may again be boxed in the $90~$95 support level or sink further into the $74~$80 support level. 


He claims that Apple will likely not release a VR product until at least 2018, especially since VR products are very expensive and the development of content will have a significant lag phase. 

This is just one expert opinion, and a very educated and informed one at that. 

He says that AAPL is not a buy now, but either a hold or sell.

16-09-09,51x7hl,New job - asset finance. Guidance for modelling/brushing up,"Hi folks.

I've lurked the forums here for a while and decided I'd pick your brains to get your thoughts.

**Background**: I've had a month or two off following my CFA 1 exam and subsequent pass. Prior to this I worked for a small-cap Private Equity firm in London as an Analyst, prior to which I did 8 months in a small/mid-cap CF boutique in Madrid. In my latest role, we weren't typical private equity in the sense we didn't use leverage, we simply provided growth capital for a significant minority stake. I've got fairly solid modelling skills when it comes to financial forecasting of a business.

**New role**: Having parted with my former employer, as they refused to pay for my CFA (it's not about the money, but the message that they're not invested in my own development when they were a very small team), I'm now moving to a firm that does asset financing. They've got a large listed fund underneath them and they're typical investments in capital assets are between 5-25m. They provide 100% LTV. 

**My question**: What sort of modelling should I brush up on prior to my start on the 12th? Realistically, it'll be very different to the kind I did in my previous role, where we were building a full business forecast for the next three years. Any thoughts, comments would be greatly appreciated, and should you require any further info I'll gladly provide it!

Thanks for your time, and for continuing to provide interesting and enjoyable content for over my morning coffee!

16-09-09,51ys7l,How do I gracefully get out of my stock mess?,"I have a confession- I got reckless with stocks. Basically, over the course of the last 4 months, I have dumped 20K into the stock market.

Luckily, I have $19000 left in the stock account. But I have really crappy stocks like:

1000 shares of GEVO, with a loss of 400 buck

500 shares of DRD, purchased at 8.50 each... now it's just $5.25 and I'm sitting on a loss of 400 bucks

600 shares of PTX, in the red also

Good stocks in the mix: 30 shares of KO and F, WRE

Etc etc 

I want to get out, but I can't because I'm hoping I can break even. But I only see some stocks, like GEVO getting worse 


You know the main problem? I don't have time to babysit my stock. I work in IT and it's getting to be interference with my work ... but I'm thinking that I'm doing it wrong. I know there are tools. I have spent alot if time checking stock prices, a bit obsessive",3

16-09-09,51z05i,Need help understanding the benefits of tax loss harvesting on short term trades,"Crosspost from /r/algotrading with a few more details:

I'm currently nearly done creating an algorithm that will re-balance multiple ETFs monthly between two different portfolios on Quantopian. I plan on using this for automated TLH but everything I read about this is talking about long term capital tax which isn't really applicable when I'm buying and selling every month.  
  

Does anyone have any prior experience with TLH on a short term basis or a formula that I can use to calculate how much benefit I'm harvesting from each loss so that I can calculate whether or not it's worth it to try offsetting the short term gains I'm getting every month?   
  
Some more info: The funds in the two pools are not ""substantially identical"" and I will wait 30 days between rebalancing. So If I buy an ETF on Jan 1 it will get sold on Feb 1st, then bought again on March 1st, alternating between the two portfolios to stay in the market. The alternative comparison would be a traditional rebalancing algo, that would buy/sell SPY as needed every month to maintain my desired allocation.  


Example: Lets say I'm swapping SPY for VTI every 30 days, no matter what, 50% of the time it's a gain, 50% of the time it's a loss but overall my portfolio is up 5% by the end of the year. Lets say it's initially worth $10,000 and I end up with $10,500. Lets pretend this means my losses are $500 and my gains are $1000. Do I gain any benefit from TLH above and beyond what I would get by Buying and selling only SPY and ending up with $500 in losses and $1000 in gains?  ",5

16-09-09,51yvdy,$SKLN: Discussion of the conference call yesterday (9/8/16) Reverse split info and NASDAQ extension,"I listened in on the CC yesterday. My impression was that it was a shakedown of shorts. HOWEVER, during Q&amp;A there was a mention that there was only one sale of their major product STREAMWAY to i forget who, which led to the spikedown in the stock price. Sounds like they're developing new marketing/sales strategies. CEO urged voters to vote YES on RS. Reasonable to believe this stock may tank initially with a NO vote, but I'm in it for the long gain. Their recent successes over the past few months speak louder than a brief conference call and they've projected to have exponential success in the 4th quarter. Additionally they announced expansion into Canadian medical systems. I work in an ED/OR and their devices would definitely be useful in the future. I will consider holding until the vote, **but would like any feedback/additional information I may have missed from any other CC listeners.** 

My reasoning it may have been a shakedown is to prepare for a more valid/stable stock value at the reverse split. Preparing for future investor confidence imo.

Will hear of NASDAQ extension of 180 days/more info of reverse split on the 15th. RS is at least 6 months out.

I just bought a house a few months ago with cash for ~200k. All was going great until I found out 3 days ago my job was being outsourced to another country. Unfortunately this company is the only place here that has anything at all involving my field and there really isn't anywhere else in the corp for me to go. 

I currently have 50k left and no debt. I've calculated out how much I'll be spending yearly in my current situation with power/HOA/food/insurance/tax/medical etc which ends up at around 12k, so I can afford to do something else for a bit. The reality is, I didn't realize how easily my job could be shipped out, and it's looking like I'm going to need to learn something else. I was trained on the spot when they opened years ago as a teen since they were desperate for people and just climbed up. No college experience.  

I've considered going back to college, but I don't want to throw all of it into a pit like that. I see so many of my college friends working retail now at grocery stores and car dealerships that it doesn't feel like a good route to take. Losing this job has me worried that a lot of things I'd be interested in as a career like that could easily be sent elsewhere. 

I guess my question is, what should I do with the rest of my money? I'm frugal, so I can stretch it forever assuming nothing critical happens to me. I could easily get a simple job for a while and live off it, but I admit, I liked being the guy with money.

16-09-10,521lyf,Going to school for free. Should I still take advantage of student loans?,"Hey guys and gals, first post here so let's get to it.


I’m young, and painfully aware that I “don’t know everything about everything, or much about anything.” I’m posting this to get feedback from older, more experienced, and smarter investors than I.



I'm wondering if it’s a good idea to take advantage of federal and private student and VA loans that are deferred until 6 - 9 months after you graduate?



I qualify for 100% of my Post 9/11 GI benefits, will be working part-time, etc, etc.



But let's say that on top of that, my freshman year I borrow roughly $50,000.00 in deferred federal student loans (current IR's are about 4.69%) with a grace period of 6 months after graduation.)



The plan is to invest this capital into various opportunities that, after much deliberation and analysis, should grow at about 9 - 12% per year.



But for the sake of the argument let's say that I play it safe and dump it all into an ETF that tracks the S&amp;P 500 index. Something like SPY.



Historically, The SPY ETF's (and S&amp;P 500) growth rate is roughly 8 -10% per year. We're going to go conservative here and adjust that to a constant 7 – 8.5% just in case. Did I mention that the SPY ETF pays a quarterly dividend? (2.02% or $4.34/share annually) Dividends that I intend to DRIP right back into the SPY to compound this financial momentum.



(Conservative) Estimates of growth from years 1 - 4:



1st year: 50,000 x 8.5% = $54,250.00 + annual dividend payment of $986.00



2nd year: $55,286.00 x 7.6% = $59,487.00 + Dividends of $1,066.00



3rd year $60,552.00 x 8.8% = $65,880 + Dividends of $1,127.00



4th year: $67,007.00 x 7.0% = $71,697.00 + Dividends of $1,215.00



Total: $72,912.00



Repayment option A: Upon graduation I would sell my position and repay the loan before the interest rates or payments were activated. Netting me a cool $22,912.00



Repayment option B: Make monthly payments on the loan with my extra income to widdle it down before graduation. The logic behind this is getting and investing 50k NOW and then paying it off vs. saving and investing 50k over 4 or 5 years. I'm thinking about the Time Value of Money here.



This growth is ONLY from the $50,000.00 loan and does not include my existing position in the SPY ETF or any other investment I am part of.



On top of this, the extra income I make from my GI bill benefits and part time work will be saved and invested (estimated around +$2,500.00/month x 8 school months = $10,000.00 per year) into stocks, options, and other securities that I deem beneficial to my portfolio.



What do you think? What have I not accounted for? What obvious financial truth have I ignored or missed or am simply not aware of? Please leave your feedback below with valid points as to why it’s a good or bad idea as well as other suggestions to wisely invest during my early twenties (Please don’t say TSP. That’s taken care of.) Any and all advice is much appreciated!",2

16-09-10,521r03,Groundhog Day - Thoughts on Upcoming Rate Hikes,"For those of you who've been in the markets long enough, the volatility surrounding rate hikes is just another fact of life. Like a UVXY reverse split. Or perhaps repressed flashbacks of being babysat by your alcoholic Uncle Steve.‎ Veterans amongst us have gone through similar speculative eras during 3+ rounds of Quantative Easing, Operation Twist and Twist Extended, and finally the Taper Tantrum. Fear of having the punch bowl taken away is nothing new.


Since the end of QE3 in late 2014, every official Fed statement, meeting minute release, interview and comment has put the market on edge. Initial estimates on the number of rate hikes by the end of 2016 ranged anywhere from 4 to 8. Every quarter since, the rumours start and the noise gets louder. Then judgement day arrives and there's a huge relief. Its like edging, but drawn out over months. And after nearly 2 years of FOMC meetings, we've had one fuckin increase. It's the same shit over and over. 


August of last year, we saw a 10% sell-off as fear of a September rate hike made even the most seasoned traders' assholes pucker. That along with the Shanghai Stock Exchange losing 50% in 6 weeks made for a memorable summer. And what happened at that September Fed meeting? Absolutely fuckin nothing.


But what did the S&amp;P 500 do after the September FOMC? It lost an additional 5.5%. Markets feared that the Fed sensed weakness in the economy and thus chose not to tighten. I still remember the confusion and flip-flopping amongst the talking heads. Morning headlines would contradict ones from the day before. Blame China. Blame oil. Global contagion became a fuckin meme. Eventually, ‎the S&amp;P recovered all its losses by early November. Still short of all-time highs reached in May 2015, but still near 2100.


The market sailed smoothly into the holiday season. A December rate hike started becoming priced in. Stocks drifted sideways for a bit. And on Dec 16, 2015 the Fed finally did it. Janet 'The Gremlin' Yellen raised rates for the first time in nearly a decade. A grand total increase of 25 basis points. That's right: from a range of 0 to 0.25%, up to 0.25 % to 0.50%. The prior upper bound became the current lower bound for fucks sake.


The day of Yellen's announcement, the market dipped. The following day, the sell off continued. Total damage: S&amp;P -3.2%. Three fuckin measly percent. Then a reversal took hold and we were back at pre-hike levels before New Year's Eve. Somewhere just below the 2100 range.


Now some may argue that the January 2016 correction was fallout from that historic December rate hike. Traders were on vacation and couldn't react immediately. Regardless, the world didn't end when the Fed pulled the trigger. We went on to make new all-time highs. Zerohedge was given a reason to renew it's web hosting plan.


And what exactly brought us to the 2200 level of Valhalla? It was the bounce back following Brexit.  The initial shock was quick and fierce, and it caught many off guard. However, the probability of Brexit passing was less than what we're currently predicting for a September rate hike. Think about that for a second.


This isn't pre-2008. We are in an era where Central Banks have everything to lose and the power to prevent it. Or at least postpone it. Consider that an official correction is regarded as -10%. It's also been the magic number where the powers-that-be step in. Either behind the scenes via the plunge protection team or FOMO, or overtly with a Fed member calling a press conference. In February of this year, they called up Jamie Dimon to act on their behalf. It's been like clockwork dating back to late 2011. Don't believe me? Go look up the past 8 dips for yourself.


If you've read this far, then I probably still have your attention. The moral of this rant is that ""history doesn't repeat itself but it often rhymes."" There will be a lot of chop over the coming weeks and months. Expect it. Position yourself in a way that makes you comfortable enough to get through the volatility. Whether that's hedging, edging, YOLO'ing SPY spreads, moving to cash, or preparing to average down.‎ Don't panic and do anything stupid.

But, looking at the performance of VGTSX, the growth is slower compared to domestic equities, even over the whole lifetime. VGTSX only shows 2% average returns over 10 years whereas the S&amp;P funds show ~7% average returns over 10 years.

# Description

Eastman Chemical Company is a specialty chemicals company that produces a range of advanced materials, chemicals and fibers. If that doesn't make you snore, them watch out, there are 5 divisions... and they are all important. i.e. it's not a matter of 1 or 2 business lines being the key. :(

Drumroll, don't hold your breath... they are Additives &amp; Functional Products, Adhesives &amp; Plasticizers, Advanced Materials, Fibers, and Specialty Fluids &amp; Intermediates. 

Okay... it doesn't make plastic, so the Graduate reference is tenuous. Sorry.

## Recent financials 

In their annual they state:

&gt; Eastman's objective is to be an outperforming specialty chemical company with consistent earnings growth and strong cash flow. 

Sure there is growth, profits and cashflow, but consistency too? In the Basic Materials industry! That would be too much goodness. 

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $9.6bn | $9.5bn | $9.4bn | $8.1bn | $7.2bn|
|EPS | $5.66 | $4.97 | $7.44 | $2.93 | $4.52|
|DPS | $1.66 | $1.45 | $1.25 | $1.08 | $0.99|


## Competition

Given they are in the commodity chemicals business with 5 divisions it's hard to throw a stone and not hit a competitor. The table below includes a collection of the 30 or so major names they list. 

Though it's great to see the high margin and great returns. Clearly management are doing an excellent job.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Eastman Chemical Company | $9,205M | 23% | 22%
Dow Chemical Co | $46,153M | 18% | 36%
BASF SE (ADR) | $67,542M | 17% | 14%
LyondellBasell Industries NV | $29,476M | 22% | 58%
Celanese Corporation | $5,502M | 17% | 12%
Huntsman Corporation | $9,869M | 11% | 13%
Trinseo S.A. | $3,789M | 11% | 71%

## Cash / Debt?

Eastman Chemical Company has $6,564M of net debt. That is 3x its latest operating profit. Ooof. Why? Well these folks are good at M&amp;A. In particular they spent $3.5bn on deals in 2014. 


# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $76.00 for Eastman Chemical Company and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 15% to their target.

# Valuation

What? 10 times forecast earnings? Huge cash yields. Sure the growth is pedestrian, but at those valuations, what's the catch?

Is the danger that we are at peak earnings? That the current optimism of management isn't justified?

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/emn/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
EMN | $9,728M | 10x | 6% | 3% | 18%
DOW | $61,176M | 16x | 8% | 3% | 20%
BASFY.PK | $76,106M | 17x | 2% | 4% | 16%
LYB | $32,647M | 8x | 6% | 4% | 19%
CE | $9,212M | 10x | 9% | 2% | 9%
HUN | $3,922M | 9x | 7% | 3% | 10%
TSE | $2,543M | 8x | 23% | 1% | 14%

# Dividends

Eastman Chemical Company is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.81 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $1.78 per share. That is a 2% growth. The forecast dividend of $1.81 compares to a forecast EPS of $6.54. I think that's Adjusted EPS, nor reported.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -10% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -7%. That's against a backdrop of sales off 9% in the first 6 months. 

Looking at latest call transcript with Wall Street brokers.

&gt; Given the challenges we face, most significantly in Chemical Intermediates and modestly in Fibers, we expect full year 2016 EPS will be down up to 10% compared with 2015.

Oh dear... but...

&gt; As I look beyond 2016, we are well positioned for growth as these short-term challenges recede and our strong growth drivers continue. Altogether, I'm confident we will continue to deliver attractive earnings growth in the long term as we transform towards a specialty portfolio. With the combined set of actions we're taking, we expect to be back on track for 8% to 12% EPS growth in 2017.

So, there's a bumpy ride ahead.

16-09-10,522e1e,Stocks have not bottomed out yet. This DIP will go down FURTHER.,"So people have been posting about:

1. [Yeah! NVDA is down almost 5%, let's buy at the dip.] 
Well that is a dangerous move, considering how this is September and the US Presidential Elections will surely make the possibility of a greater dip being possible. I wouldn't be surprised if NVDA dips below $50, considering how it gained 100% this year. Again, I wouldn't be surprised if it did, I'm NOT saying that it WILL drop below $50, just that I won't be surprised if it did. 

2. [It's a good time to buy AAPL.] 
This is hilarious. The iPhone 7 is the 2nd worst performing iPhone announcement. 
http://fortune.com/2016/09/09/apple-stock-iphone-launches/
And again with the added volatility from September through to December, this might be the worst time to buy AAPL, even if it lost 6% already after the iPhone 7 announcement. 

3. [AT&amp;T is at a dip. Let's buy!]
Again.. this doesn't make any logical sense. Not only does predicting a dip this early on into a volatile season not make any sense, but it's a recipe for financial disaster. And with seasonal sales of smartphones to pick up during December and with AT&amp;T stock to lose a couple more percent prior to this season, it would be more logical to buy later. 

This is only the start of the 'dip', people. Please educate yourselves about stock market trends and seasonal influences before diving into buying tens of thousands of dollars of stocks. 

Discuss. ",29

16-09-09,51zvmu,Something you idiots need to understand about monetary policy,"Do I think a rate hike is coming before the election? Fuck no it isn't.  So why is everyone so upset over that Rosengren keeps talking about raising rates?

It's actually really simple, and it's basically just inverse pump &amp; dump.  It also isn't covered in high school macro economics which is why WSB has never heard of this; Time inconsistency of policy.

Here's the breakdown.  Suppose the fed wants to raise raise rates in September, and they don't want the markets to go into freefall by just surprising them by raising rates without expectations (this would be bad monetary policy).  So the fed (rosengren) goes out and talks about the possibility of raising rates and why this would be good.  The markets then listen to this cuck talk and expect rates to go up, which essentially does some of the work for him.  Expectations play a huge part in economics and markets, which the fed uses to their benefit.  The fed can continue to do this until they actually raise rates, extending that timeframe out until they have a good window to do so.  They can then make the optimal decision in their September meeting based on the current landscape.

Can they do this forever?  Yes, but they lose credibility until they stop lying.  Unfortunately the Fed promising they will do something doesn't mean too much until they actually do it.  The longer they wait the more inevitable a rate increase will be, but for now the important thing is this:  Just them TALKING about a rate increase does part of the job that they are trying to get done.  In my opinion, like most of wsb, is that a rate increase won't come until after the election.  Until then rosengren will open his fat mouth a couple more times talking about expectations and blah blah blah.

tldr stop complaining about rosengren and learn macroeconomics",41
16-09-09,51zvsm,Shorting major indexes?,"Two parter...1, regardless of whether it's a good bet, what would be best best means to place a small bet against the major global indexes, i.e. betting on a global economic crash. I'm relatively low net worth, low six liquid, and I can't expose much any of my cash in risky gambles, since I've got life stuff in the near future. I could play with at most a stack or two. 

Part 2, how big an idiot am I to make such a bet? Even if you agree that a reckoning is coming, am i way early for a short? My guess would be late 2017 or 18, but something could happen earlier in 2017. Worry about a margin call or getting stopped out before I hit.

16-09-10,524efw,Opportunities after the dip,"Hi All

I guess we will see some selloff on monday so I am thinking of buying some ""boring"" stocks maybe 5-10% cheaper. I am aiming for dividend stocks of great companies.
I only have 50K set aside for this so I will probably just buy 3 stocks. 

Here are some of my ideas:
Dividend achievers, aristocrats: 
VZ, GM, PSX, INTC, KO, PG, MMM, TGT, 

smaller REIT company: WSR (over 8% yield, great company)
Do you have any more ideas maybe? 

Basically I am looking for companies with a long history, nice dividends and so on.

16-09-09,5207qm,"Lets talk about this ""bond-bubble""...","I've heard this argument a few times, and most recently a video of the Chicago guy on TastyTrade. Tell me if I'm crazy for not believing it. Here's the theory:

Interest rates are already so low that there's nowhere for them to go but up.

This guy told his viewers to go out and short the bond market.

For the sake of the argument, lets take high levels of inflation off the table.



If the Fed raises rates, it contracts the currency supply and that is deflationary. 

Bonds are much better in deflation because inflation/deflation don't affect the value of underlying bonds, just the trading value. That's not the case with equities, and they'll get cheaper as a result.

And with today's levels of inflation already being very low, policy makers have no choice but to lower interest rates in a bear market even if it's negative yielding. Taking a loss on bonds is better than your debtors defaulting on loans.



Take a look at the the 2% drop in the S&amp;P500 today when the Fed leader of some city said that a rate hike was possible. Do you think this environment is has enough confidence in the economy to not move to Government Bonds when something seriously goes wrong?



Except for very high inflation, I think the bond market, especially US Government Bonds, are solid investments over the course of the next 4 or so years.

What do you think? Feel free to educate me.",10

Between federal and CA state tax, my marginal tax rate is &gt;50% and I'm trying to better understand the tax exemp status of VCADX. I have two primary questions:

1) Under the ""Price and Performance"" tab on the vanguard website, the returns after taxes on distributions is equivalent to the return before taxes.  This makes sense since there should be no tax.  However, the ""return after taxes on distributions and sale of fund shares"" is less than the ""return before taxes.""  Are only the distributions tax exempt, but any gains on the fund price are subject to tax?  What exactly is tax exempt?

2) With returns of 4.86% over 10 years, and a &gt;50% marginal tax rate, this would be equivalent to a 9.72% return on taxable earnings. That to me seems very good, and it even beats out VTSAX over 10 years.  So, why would I allocate anything to the stock market if I can get an 9.7% equivalent return on muni bonds that are presumably less risky?  What am I missing here?",1

My first online tool is a 401(k) simulator, and I thought /r/investing may find it useful. You can find it at: http://personal-finance-tools.com/#retirementSim

**How it works** (for more info, see the FAQs http://personal-finance-tools.com/#faq ):

I've collected historical DJI data going all the way back to 1900 (yes, this even includes the Great Depression). To run a single simulation, the calculator will choose a DJI starting point somewhere between 1900 and 2016 then -- week by week, starting from your principal amount -- simulate your 401(k) contributions and the fluctuating market until it reaches the target date or 401(k) account value. This is repeated using DJI starting points every 2 years, resulting in nearly 60 unique stock market simulations.

Since most 401(k) plans will redistribute to a lower-risk fund over time, I've also collected almost 30 years of PTTRX data, and simulate redistribution using an allocation strategy that loosely mimicks a 120 minus your age formula. Similar to stock market simulations, starting points are chosen for every 2 years, resulting in 15 unique runs. When combined with stock market, this results in about 850 total simulations.",246

16-09-12,52bj3m,Confusion regarding investing,"Hi Reddit,

I'm under 25 and interested in investing. I've been doing research, but there are a few things I haven't been able to understand

To preface, I am a student in Canada, making no income, and have $1200 I'd like to invest. Through research I've understood that investing is a broad term including government bonds, forex, stock trading, etc. For the sake of this post I'm referring to stock and options trading and potentially forex (while a bit juvenile, the type of stuff you see in Hollywood when big bankers are staring at graphs and making heated phone calls)

From what I've read this is likely called day trading, but (from what I know) I'm not interested in day trading in its purest sense. I'll be in school the majority of the day and will buy and sell a few stocks here and there, perhaps buy and sell same day, maybe not sell for a year (or ever in the foreseeable future), buy some options and see where it gets me. What I've read makes it seem like I should just buy a stock and sit on it, but I want to be a bit more active. I don't want to treat this as a gamble, and while I'm not going to lose sleep over this money, my goal is to make money from it

I'm having issues with the technicalities. I will essentially be recycling this $1200 for the foreseeable future, meaning I don't intend to add out of pocket money that hasn't been generated by the trades themselves. For this reason, I'm looking for a discount broker (available in Canada) with small fees per trade (I've heard Virtual Brokers may work for this)

Secondly, I don't understand the taxes aspect of this, at all. I haven't yet had to deal with taxes due to being a student with no income and living with my family. What exactly is taxed for me, if anything, and potentially how much? Say I make $200 and want to take it out and spend it. Will taxes, if any, be applied automatically? If I don't do anything regarding taxes with that money, spend it, and for whatever reason get audited, is that somehow tax evasion?

Third, I see brokers offering TFSAs and RESPs, which makes me question, what exactly is a broker? Previously, I thought a broker was simply a means between me and the stock market, kind of like how an ISP is a means between me and the Internet. However, I only know of TFSAs and such as being related to banks (I currently have a TFSA with roughly $2000 that I'm just not touching, and as far as I understand I'm simply making a little bit of interest on it per month without being taxed. Again, the tax part I don't understand. If I had a regular savings account, what is getting taxed and why?

Basically, I am an absolute, absolute beginner. Investopedia and various YouTube videos (and even a few recommended investing books) have helped me understand things such as options, P/E ratios, advice from investors, etc. and while that's all fine and dandy, I'm missing the crucial piece of how to actually get started. I've been looking for ""beginner resources"" but I've come to realise they still assume you to have more financial knowledge than I have

Thanks in advance!",0

You can find it [here](http://www.herontx.com/HTX-019)

It's very intriguing because it's an old drug *minus one key ingredient* - ""Polysorbate 80"" or ""Tween-80"".

Why is this so interesting? Well first, why are they taking it out?

&gt;***Fosaprepitant contains polysorbate 80***, which ***may cause allergic reactions***, including the potential to cause ***severe anaphylaxis, and infusion site reactions***.1 In a review of cancer drugs containing polysorbate 80, ***hypersensitivity reactions were linked to at least 23 deaths*** in spite of the fact that all 23 patients had received premedication to prevent hypersensitivity reactions.

[This](http://cdn-0.sci-toys.com/ingredients/polysorbate80.gif) is the chemical structure of Polysorbate-80

It has a lipohilic tail, with a hydrophobic headgroup, which is common to non-ionic surfactants.

What company has a non-ionic surfactant as their lead drug candidate?

That R I P mast company.

[Here's](http://heraldopenaccess.us/fulltext/Hematology-Blood-Transfusion-&amp;-Disorders/Figure%201.2.jpg) the structure of their drug.

No. Fuck you. Pull your head outside his asshole long enough to realize the scam. All the info you'd ever need is on Investopedia and reddit. Learn to search! We can teach you to lose money way better with more flair than that crusty old faggot

Did you make him show his account? You see his trades and how much he made before claiming to be a teacher? He lost money. He didn't beat the market.

That's what day trading is moron it's gambling. You can't fucking learn a strategy to be a professional gambler. Getting an edge is for few masters way smarter than you who cheat and know math. Are you asian? Then don't pretend you stand a chance. House always wins

We gamble because it's a fucking rush and we could get lucky and hitch a ride to the moon. Only reason it's better than shit like lottery is there's more to fuck around with so it's fun and you can feel like you could find a winning strategy.

Fuck you Clay you scamming asshole. Go get a job. Those thousands you waste on Clay University coulda been spent on losing stocks where at least you had a chance. You have no chance with Clay. He don't make you more likely to win. He'll only leave you feeling smart wondering why your assholes sore

Fuck yourself. Don't let someone else fuck you. 

I gotta post about other YouTube scammers but I ain't gonna prolly. Then how bout that Sasha faggot. You know him as the winy little bitch with a face you wanna punch. evdakov is his name. Sasha Eadacoxk is another scammer preying on plebs. He has fancy videos where he plays teacher. He sells bullshit too even one on one can shows where he makes you pay by the minute for help and for extra he'll flash his tiny dick

Look they're all scams. Real playas win they don't play teacher. You roll the dice and if you're lucky enough to find an edge you keep your mouth shut and ride it out til it don't work no more. Then you lose it yoloing bigger trades or splurge on some hookers

16-09-12,52ekqb,NRG set to buy SunEdison [SUNQ] alternative energy projects,"NRG set to buy SunEdison alternative energy projects

NRG Energy is the winning bidder for a selection of SunEdison’s solar- and wind-power projects, according to a Sept. 9 court notice.

Stalking-horse bidder NRG has agreed to pay $144 million for the equity of the SunEdison units that own the alternative energy projects, which are located in California, Hawaii, Maine, Texas, Utah, and Washington.

The Manhattan bankruptcy court overseeing the case will consider sale approval on Sept. 15.

It appears that no alternative bidders made offers for the assets by a Sept. 6 bid deadline.

On Aug. 9, SunEdison requested approval of sale procedures for the alternative energy projects (see “SunEdison gets baseline offer for alternative-energy projects,” LCD News, Aug. 10, 2016.)

As reported, the company is divesting assets in an effort to slim down its business and reorganize around its core operations, and is in talks with advisers to 
develop a consensual Chapter 11 plan.— Kelsey Butler

SO when a trader looses money, They don't want to lose anymore fearing it will just keep going down, And they don't think it will go up anymore,  Causing them to sell for less than what they bought, Which means losing money. 

So when anyone says they loose money trading stocks, Is that actually how they loose money?

[Here is a comment from two days ago. I have made similar comments in the past but deleted them but some of you have probably read my comments, seen my flair, and now connect the two](www.np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/51zvmu/something_you_idiots_need_to_understand_about/d7gbvva) 

&gt;Obviously even if Hillary wins then they still will raise rates, but it's Obama's legacy that Hillary is riding on and what Obama is trying to protect (create). If Hillary won and they raised rates, she will has more than 3 years to go so that temporary dip in the market will be long forgotten by the time she leaves office/enters her second term (and for Obama, it would be one of the last things people remembered about him). Plus if Hillary wins Yellen would probably get a second term.

[Also a comment of mine right before that which consists of the same logic Trump used to arrive at some of his claims about Obama's legacy today.](www.np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/51zvmu/something_you_idiots_need_to_understand_about/d7g9fhy)

&gt; Basically it will make Obama and Hillary look bad if the market is down a lot from actually raising rates, but if they just threaten rates whenever trump is neck and neck with Hillary, then they can blame the fears in the market on him whenever they go on TV.

[Here's Trump's statements from today](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/12/trump-says-fed-chief-yellen-should-be-ashamed.html)

&gt;Trump said rates are being kept lower to bolster Obama's legacy. ""Any increase at all will be a very, very small increase because they want to keep the market up so Obama goes out and let the new guy ... raise interest rates ... and watch what happens in the stock market.""

&gt;GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump told CNBC on Monday the Federal Reserve is doing what President Barack Obama wants by keeping interest rates low.

Apparently /r/wallstreetbets is Trump's newest campaign [Chairmen](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/113/071/436.png) and we didn't even know it.

TLDR: Trump reposts comments he sees on /r/wallstreetbets .

I cannot find any news on why this sudden jump. Anyone?


**edit**

* It could be the ""Fire Burns After Transformer Explosion at Lehigh Valley Natural Gas Power Plant"" that may result in some minor decrease in supply

* It could be the change in weather predictions. Up to friday the 8 to 14 day outlook was below average in the southern states, now it is above average. This may cause a short term increase in supply. Although the 14 to 30 day outlook for the northern states is above average. A warmer October, results in less demand.

* Could be something not yet public. Odd that it jumped 4.5%, then came down to +1.4% and now its up 3.7% again.

I hope your enjoyed the first week of the Reddit Open Yale Course on Financial Markets. This week we will go beyond the basics and discuss Risk and Financial Crises.

Before we start with the study materials for this week, there are a few updates:

* Wefarrell and pidge11 formed a NYC-based study group. If you are interested in joining them, reach out to /u/wefarrell.
* MGreymanN opened [a Discord Server](https://discord.gg/mU8vJ), which allows users to (voice) chat about the course content. Could be very useful for those who want to meet up with other users! 
* As long as no other content is stickied (the limit is 2 threads), /u/MasterCookSwag pledged that this discussion threads can be stickied throughout the week.

###Study materials for this week
* Watch | [Youtube Lecture: Week 2 - Risk and Financial Crises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbosMr2JVrc)
* Read | Gary Gorton, '[Slapped in the Face by the Invisible Hand](https://www.frbatlanta.org/-/media/Documents/news/conferences/2009/financial-markets-conference/gorton.pdf)' (2009)
* Read | Chapter 1 and 11 of *Finance and the Good Society*.

[The manual ​contains some background information](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5v8ErcJC21MeUR1WDIyYzNRcTg/view?usp=sharing) on 'Slapped in the Face by the Invisible Hand', as well as a fair share of questions and additional reading materials. It might take a while to get through the paper, but I would say it is incredibly rich in terms of providing a window as to how banking (crises) work(s). 
​​​​
For requests, contributions, or anything related to the course - use this e-mail (yoc.reddit [at] gmail.com) or send a PM to /u/indefinitely_not.

16-09-12,52flhl,LSDoughnut is a horrible trader and should probably be banned.,"I know a lot of people delete their wrong calls, but this guy goes around pretending he's a millionaire and knowledgeable. I saw the guy post about 4-6 times about how much smarter he was than everyone because he bought JDST today and how JNUG was gonna hit hard (because if a small intra-day dip). I see how both are doing, and curiously enough all his comments from earlier are gone. 

He's a paper trader with YTD returns of -45% (speculative statement but probably true).

The day isn't over so he could still turn out to be right, however deleting your posts like that is pathetic.",164

I honestly don't understand how this bubble keeps going. And if the Fed is going to do anything to keep it going - why don't they just come out and say so? Why do I have to worry if they're going to pull the rug out from under my feet if I ""buy the dip"" at the exact wrong time?

You can find it [here](http://www.herontx.com/HTX-019)

It's very intriguing because it's an old drug *minus one key ingredient* - ""Polysorbate 80"" or ""Tween-80"".

Why is this so interesting? Well first, why are they taking it out?

&gt;***Fosaprepitant contains polysorbate 80***, which ***may cause allergic reactions***, including the potential to cause ***severe anaphylaxis, and infusion site reactions***.1 In a review of cancer drugs containing polysorbate 80, ***hypersensitivity reactions were linked to at least 23 deaths*** in spite of the fact that all 23 patients had received premedication to prevent hypersensitivity reactions.

[This](http://cdn-0.sci-toys.com/ingredients/polysorbate80.gif) is the chemical structure of Polysorbate-80

It has a lipohilic tail, with a hydrophilic ethylene glycol headgroup, which is common to non-ionic surfactants.

What company has a non-ionic, lipophilic tail, ethylene glycol headgroup surfactant as their lead drug candidate?

That R I P mast company.

[Here's](http://heraldopenaccess.us/fulltext/Hematology-Blood-Transfusion-&amp;-Disorders/Figure%201.2.jpg) the structure of their drug.

If you don't know chemistry you're not going to get it. But basically pretty fucking similar.

But the discussion really raised more questions for me. And would love to get folks to share their views on REITs. Are you game? 

If you've a view on *any* of these, would really appreciate it.

* Are REITs only / best for tax efficient accounts? 
* Is there a difference between putting them in an IRA versus a ROTH?
* Is there a scenario where you'd own them outside a tax efficient account?
* How do you value a REIT?
* Any idea what P/AFFO is and how to use it?
* How do you look at the yield of a REIT: gross versus net?
* How do you compare an investment in a REIT versus an investment in any other stock?

And no prizes for anyone who types:

&gt; It depends.

The Polycom merger ws announced in April and was not well received.  The stock fell from $8.21 to about $6.00 due to concerns about the company's direction and the level of debt.  However, a counterbid by Siris Capital was announced at the end of July and Mitel withdrew from the contest allowing its stock to, briefly, climb back over $8.

However since then the stock has fallen back to $7.27 despite decent Q2 results with an 11% increase in revenues, 13% increase in adjusted EBITDA and 70% increase in non GAAP EPS.

Trading on a PE of about 11 and forward 2017 PE of 7.5 Mr Williams has increased his holdings from 157,000 to 170,000 stocks.  Other investors may join him.

Still, Weight Watchers has struggled to pull out of its slump, most recently posting second-quarter sales that missed estimates.

The one year anniversary approaches of Meg Whitman abandoning HP and sailing off with the Enterprise division. In that time, HPE's gone from $14 to $20. 

But poor old HPQ has found itself taking a dive to a low of $9 and only recently making it back to $14. Nice one Meg. 

So is HPQ a value trap?

# Description

HP is a leading global provider of personal computing and other access devices, imaging and printing products, and related technologies, solutions and services. HP sells to individual consumers, small- and medium-sized businesses (""SMBs"") and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health and education sectors.

In reality, all that's left are PCs and Printers :( And the tail wags the dog. Sales in Printers was $14bn v PCs' $22bn, but Printers pre-tax earnings were $2.5bn v PCs earning $0.8bn. 

## Recent financials 

Given the separation of HPE, I don't have a handy look at the sales, so here's the data for the last nine months.

|9 months to |July 2015A| July 2016A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $39bn | $36bn | 
|EPS | $1.20 | $1.23 | 

So yes, business is still going backwards, but it's a graceful decline for the behemoth and the earnings are managing to rise a little as efficiencies are made.

## Competition

The competition in PCs is the usual list of suspects: Lenovo, Dell, Acer, ASUSTeK, Apple, Toshiba and Samsung. And in Printers we've all heard the names too: Canon, Lexmark, Xerox, Seiko Epson, Ricoh, Samsung and Brother.

What's pretty remarkable for such a cut-throat market that feels so commodity is (a) double digit markets and (b) high returns are possible! Though it looks like the Printer companies are in better shape than the PC ones.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
HP Inc | $47,992M | 11% | 32%
Dell Technologies Inc | $52,933M | 5% | N/A
Lenovo Group Limited (ADR) | $44,252M | 1% | -ve
Apple Inc. | $220,288M | 34% | 38%
Toshiba Corp (USA) | $55,207M | -4% | -ve
Canon Inc (ADR) | $35,313M | 15% | 7%
Lexmark International Inc | $3,489M | 12% | -ve
Xerox Corp | $17,652M | 11% | 4%

aside: Dell Tech is the merged Dell / EMC monster, so maybe the comparison there isn't fair. Plus I get the impression that Wall Street isn't yet covering the stock properly.

## Cash / Debt?

HP Inc has $1,199M of net debt. That is 0.2x its latest operating profit. So nothing to worry about, In fact they could probably manage a little M&amp;A if they wanted. 

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $15.54 for HP Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 10% to their target.

# Valuation

At 9 times earnings it could well be cheap, but maybe there's a reason. Is it a value trap? Both units are in decline and the better one seems like it's declining fastest.

XRX | $9,718M | 9x | 3% | 3% | 18%

# Dividends

HP Inc is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.53 per share. Which compares to a forecast EPS of $1.60. The company has substantial room to do share buyback, but hasn't been too aggressive to date.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 8% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 1%. On a 6 month basis the stocks up 23% with no change in the earnings forecasts. So it's fair to say the stock's re-rated off its lows. 

Looking at the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers there is a lot of talk about efficiencies, a rich heritage, the margins in the printer business, divestitures, and even a mention of innovation.  On the negative side... they worried about Brexit and the EU economy.

It's hard to see where the catalysts come. 

* Sure there should be some industrial consolidation in both PCs and Printers, but is HPQ the buyer or the seller? 
* Management's done a good job protecting the cash cow to-date, but is there a moment where the printer business' margins crumble?
* And innovation... without, isn't this stock going to remain ex-growth? And if you want an ex-growth stock, isn't Apple or Gilead a more appealing option?

For now, I'm in two minds, yes the 4% divie is nice, and there looks like there is room for more, but the long-term outlook is grim. 

Can anyone see a bright future?

16-09-12,52hcdv,"Warren Buffett's thoughts on Diversification","Stumbled across the following reading Zerohedge

&gt; Harry Markowitz developed the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) in the 1950’s. Simply put his theory argues that portfolio risk can be reduced by holding combinations of different securities and asset classes that are not positively correlated.  We agree with the theory that there are benefits to diversification but we do not subscribe to MPT. Diversification makes sense when you buy uncorrelated assets that are undervalued. Buying assets for the sake of diversification without regard for valuation is fraught with risk regardless of how many different securities and asset classes one may hold.  

&gt; **In the words of Warren Buffett 
 “diversification is a protection against ignorance. It makes very little sense for those that know what they are doing”. 
 To paraphrase Warren Buffet, diversification is for those that do not know what they are doing.**",19

16-09-13,52kg28,Investing at a 20: should I invest more in developing markets?,"Tldr: I'm young, comfortable with a fair degree of risk and have already begun investing. Should I now shift my assets slightly more towards emerging/developing markets given I have a long time frame to work with. (If you think I should, further suggestions for funds / trackers are welcome). 

A few months ago, just after Brexit (from the UK) I began investing. It's something I read up on fairly extensively before committing. I invested in the usual (uk / us index trackers, a developing market tracker, a biotech fund and an emerging market property tracker and a number of stocks). Since then my portfolio has done fairly well, given that I missed the initial rebound by a couple of days. In the meantime I've been doing a fair amount of reading about the state of US and Uk equities and how the growth potential is at an all time low (bogle is one of the people cited and he predicts 2% real return factoring in dividends). 

Now whether or not this might be true I'm sat here wondering whether it would be better to take more risk with my money, given my age. I'm planning to stow it away for the long haul and leave it to accumulate whilst adding to it when I leave full time education. I have an emergency fund so that's a non issue. with all this in mind do you think it makes more sense to invest at least some of this money in developing / emerging markets e.g ishares Brazil fund or fidelities China special situations?",1

This is my first time having a HSA, so some noobish questions. My HSA goes through HSA Bank. The two investment options are shown here: http://www.hsabank.com/hsabank/members/hsa-investments

There's TD Ameritrade and DEVENIR (DEVENIR's funds are listed here: http://www.hsabank.com/~/media/files/devenir_mutual_fund_options). I'm leaning towards TD Ameritrade because all the funds for DEVENIR have really high ERs. 

Having said that, I have a few questions with inveseting with HSA Bank/TD Ameritrade.

1. Has anyone used TD Ameritrade to buy Vanguard funds such as VTSAX? Does the vanguard minimums still apply when using TD Ameritrade (such as the 3K for VTSMX, 10K for VTSAX) or can I just buy into the mutual fund? 

2. It sounds like I can automatically funnel distributions from my HSA into investments. In which case, does TD Ameritrade have a fee to buy additional amounts of either Vanguard Mutual Funds or Vanguard ETFs?

Finally just a side note, how much do most people feel comfortable having in their HSA bank (not investments?). I assume this depends on age and general health. I was thinking about leaving around 1000-1500 in my HSA Bank and send the rest to investments. I believe my deductible is around 1500.",3

16-09-13,52krhs,Volatility Hedging,"It's no secret that these are volatile times, what with Pepe being covered on CNN and whatnot so I've been thinking about ways tomake mad gains off these sorts of market changes. Here's something I've been thinking about, tell me why it won't work and why I'm a cum dumpster.

The strategy: take an initial investment and split it in half. Wait for the markets to get extremely volatile and put half of your cash on SPY calls and the other half on SPY puts. The idea is that your losses on any one of the options is 100% but your gains are uncapped. As long as you close one of your positions at 100%+ you're in the green. And once you hit that 100% you can even let the other contract lapse and still make gainz. 

The win-win scenario is if you can close both options in the green. Say, if the SPY went up 1% on a monday and down &gt;1% on a tuesday but when would that ever happen, right?

Now obviously the major flaw is that if any of the securities don't rise about 100% you're boned. The workaround is to not being a headass and only deploying this strategy when there is a crazy amount of uncertainty. But besides that and commissions, I can't think of another reason it wouldn't work. 

Also, if you tell me I'm cutting into my gains as a reason to not do it please do the following: 1. Learn what hedging is and 2. Go Fuck Yourself",4

# Description

Accenture provides management consulting, technology and outsourcing services. They employ more than 358,000 people and have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 55 countries. And their clients are typically Fortune Global 500 and Fortune 1000 companies, medium-sized companies, governments, government agencies and other enterprises. 

## Recent financials 

The sales and earnings have been on the up for years. And the company is a pretty nice cash cow. 

|Year to August|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $33bn | $32bn | $30bn | $30bn | $27bn|
|EPS | $4.76 | $4.52 | $4.93 | $3.84 | $3.39|

When you dig into the numbers you'll see that there are 5 divisions: (Media &amp; Tech; Finance; Health &amp; Govts; Products; and Resources) that typically generate $5 to 7 bn of sales and just under $1bn of operating profit each. i.e. this isn't a 1 / 2 trick pony. However, the US is about half of sales, Europe a third with Growth Markets the rest.

## Competition

Their annual accounts aren't very illuminating on competition.

&gt; We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing global marketplace and compete with a variety of organizations that offer services and solutions competitive with those we offer. 

But looking at the figures, their margins aren't the highest in the business, but they do have pretty impressive returns.


|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Accenture Plc | $34,197M | 16% | 58%
International Business Machines Corp. | $80,261M | 22% | 81%
Infosys Ltd ADR | $9,721M | 28% | 24%
Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp | $12,991M | 20% | 16%
Wipro Limited (ADR) | $7,884M | 21% | 19%
Fujitsu Ltd (ADR) | $46,764M | 7% | 8%
Computer Sciences Corporation | $7,232M | 11% | -ve

## Cash / Debt?

Accenture Plc has $3,472M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 5% of the market value of Accenture Plc. So it's really no surprise that they are aggressively buying back stock! 

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $123.62 for Accenture Plc and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 10% to their target.

# Valuation

And when it comes to valuation, you won't be surprised that it's not a ""Value"" stock, but a ""Quality"" one. It has growth, it is throwing off lots of cash, and the management team are well regarded. 

It all adds up to over 20x earnings for the year to August 2016. Though if you scroll forward to the August 2017 forecast of $5.83 per share (expected to grow 9%), then we are talking 17x earnings.

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/acn/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
ACN | $73,370M | 21x | 10% | 2% | 8%
IBM | $151,301M | 12x | 3% | 3% | 14%

FJTSY.PK | $10,646M | 13x | 11% | 2% | 28%
CSC | $6,627M | 17x | 8% | 1% | 10%

# Dividends
Accenture Plc is forecast to pay a dividend of $2.30 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $2.20 per share. That is a 5% growth. The forecast dividend of $2.30 compares to a forecast EPS of $5.33.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -5% That compares with no change in the earnings forecasts. In the last 6 months the stock is up 6% with earnings forecasts up just 2%. So...a solid stable outlook there!

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, they pretty much affirmed all their guidance on revenue growth, margin expansion, cashflow, and share buybacks. It's hard to see any surprises. 

For me, what's missing is the outlook for the year to August 2017. Results are on 29th Sept... if it's steady as she goes with [Wall Street's views](http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/analyst?symbol=ACN.N) on next year... $35bn of sales up from $33bn, and EPS up 9%, then good stuff. If not, maybe there's a wobble and a chance to get in ""cheap""?

""Icahn developed a reputation as a ruthless ""corporate raider"" after his hostile takeover of TWA in 1985.[11] The result of that takeover was Icahn systematically selling TWA's assets to repay the debt he used to purchase the company, which was described as asset stripping. In 1988, Icahn took TWA private, gaining a personal profit of $469 million, and leaving TWA with a debt of $540 million. In 1991, Icahn sold TWA's prized London routes to American Airlines for $445 million.[12] Carl Icahn formed lowestfares.com to sell TWA tickets and acquired portions of Global Leisure Travel from Ramy El-Batrawi to merge into it.[13]""",17

16-09-13,52l7cw,Anyone else watching the recent downside breakout in the 30-year bond market?,"Just my opinion, but I think the long-awaited, short-US treasury trade might finally be underway here. The Fed is finally saying the interest rate hikes are coming, the Eurozone recently announced that they were not cutting rates further, you have sub 5% unemployment, booming housing prices in most markets, etc. 

If a major top has indeed been reached in the bond market, there are major implications for US stocks and gold....namely, lower prices &amp; volatility. However, shorting treasuries likely will allow full participation in the downside of stocks/gold, but with a much cleaner move to the downside since there is so much air beneath this thing. I almost view short the bond market here like buying the stock market in March 2009. Anyone else have any thoughts on this?

I was a bit surprised to see the put option price changes all over the board regardless of the strike prices distance from the stock price. Usually when I see this it's a question of volume but these strikes all had 500-2000 contracts traded. Much higher than the oil industry stocks I usually follow. 

Is this why people often buy spreads instead of all one strike price? My current brokerage doesn't seem to have as good of a interface to buy multiple strikes under the same trade (so it's only charged 1 fee). My old brokerage seemed better at this = /.

16-09-13,52nhey,Bayer to Acquire Monsanto ($MON) for $129 in Cash Tomorrow Morning,"Story as of 13 minutes ago:
Berlin, Sept 13, 2016 (AFP) -

German pharmaceutical and chemical group Bayer is preparing to increase its takeover offer for US seeds and pesticides giant Monsanto for a fourth time, a report said Tuesday.

Bayer will offer an increased $129 (115 euros) per share for Monsanto, compared with the $127.50 it proposed last week, the German regional newspaper Rheinische Post said in a report on its website.

On September 5, Monsanto confirmed it had received the $127.50 offer and was engaged in ""constructive negotiations"" with Bayer but was also considering proposals from other parties.

Bayer made a first all-cash offer in May of $122 per share, which Monsanto rejected as ""incomplete and financially inadequate"". The German company's second offer was $125 per share.

A merger of the two companies would create a new global leader in genetically modified (GM) seeds and pesticides.

As part of its latest proposal, Bayer will also offer to double, to $3 billion, the compensation it would have to pay to Monsanto if the deal is stopped by competition regulators, Rheinische Post said.

The proposed tie-up has rung alarms bells for some farmers who fear the power of the combined company in the market for seeds and pesticides, while opponents of GM food in Europe worry about Monsanto's influence on the continent.",29

# Description
Alcoa Inc. is a leading integrated provider of Aluminium. It goes all the way from mining, refining, smelting, fabricating to recycling. Though they do more, with titanium and nickel in their toolkit too.

But let's not forget that management is planning to [split the business](https://www.alcoa.com/global/en/about_alcoa/corp_gov/PDFs/form-10-presentation.pdf) in two. With the upstream (fabrication / finished goods / technology ) to be called Arconic with $12bn of sales and most of the profits... and the spin off, to be called Alcoa to have $11bn of sales, do the mining, smelting, etc. i.e. All the boring dirty stuff!  

## Recent financials 

Unlike most Mining &amp; Materials companies the top lines been pretty stable, but like the peers, the earnings have been a rollercoaster. And against that backdrop the divies been flat as a pancake.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $23bn | $24bn | $23bn | $24bn | $25bn|
|EPS | -$0.31 | $0.21 | -$2.14 | $0.18 | $0.57|
|DPS | $0.12 | $0.12 | $0.12 | $0.12 | $0.12|


## Competition

Now there is a bit of finger pointing in here:

&gt; the markets for Alcoa’s aluminum and non-aluminum products are highly competitive, including some that are subsidized.

The Chinese perhaps? Though fat lot of good it does them when you look at their profitability.

Though a far more interesting comment in their annual report is

&gt; Alcoa’s competitive position depends, in part, on the Company’s ability to leverage its innovation expertise across its businesses and key end markets and, in the case of its upstream businesses, having access to an economical power supply to sustain its operations in various countries.

i.e. Cheap energy supplies are key. And one of the reasons for its high margins. 

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Alcoa Inc | $21,060M | 12% | -ve
Norsk Hydro ASA (ADR) | $10,214M | 14% | 5%
Aluminum Corp. of China Limited (ADR) | $18,485M | 3% | 1%

Nucor Corporation | $15,644M | 13% | 6%
Freeport-McMoRan Inc | $14,337M | 13% | -ve

## Cash / Debt?

Alcoa Inc has $6,440M of net debt. That is 2.5x its latest operating profit. AA has been making targeted acquisitions, which has driven up the debt levels. They are not dangerously high, and paying off debts can help drive earnings. But it's worth keeping an eye on this metric, if you are tempted to buy.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $11.31 for Alcoa Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 19% to their target.

# Valuation

But why would the stock deserve to trade higher than its current 22 times? The yield isn't impressive, the growth not forecast to be any better than Kaiser or Constellium. If you look to the other US mining/material majors (NEM / NUE / FCX) it's hard to see what would make AA stand out. On the contrary!

Or perhaps Wall Street is already pricing in a boost to 2017, where [they think](http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/analyst?symbol=AA) EPS will rise to 0.57 from 0.44 in 2016. A nice 30% jump.

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/aa/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
AA | $12,522M | 22x | 9% | 1% | 7%
NHYDY.PK | $8,266M | 19x | -ve | 3% | 16%
ACH | $7,683M | -ve | N/A | 0% | 6%
KALU.O | $1,474M | 16x | 18% | 2% | 10%
CSTM.K | $736M | 26x | 36% | 0% | N/A
NEM | $20,704M | 22x | 19% | 0% | 8%
NUE | $14,651M | 17x | 20% | 3% | 12%
FCX | $13,482M | 21x | N/A | 0% | N/A

# Dividends
Alcoa Inc is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.13 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $0.12 per share. That is a 8% growth. The forecast dividend of $0.13 compares to a forecast EPS of $0.44. 

Though I have to admit, I am skeptical...perhaps there is one analyst out there forecasting a jump in the divie, so he can stand out. And that's messing with the consensus.


# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 1% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 26%.

It's hard to see any major catalysts in the near term.

* Sure they could keep doing targeted M&amp;A and are squeezing out nice synergies. But aren't debt levels too high for any major cash based deals.
* For me what's key, is when will folks be confident in the 2017 forecasts? Will it be on 10th Oct when management report the 3Q figures?
* Or maybe it is time the revisit the dividend. A move on that could be a real boost to sentiment?
* Finally, there are planning to [split the business](https://www.alcoa.com/global/en/news/pdf/press_release/Alcoa_Files_Form_10_Registration_Statement_2016-06-29.pdf) in two! Now, we've seen this show before, e.g. HPQ / HPE and Baxter / Baxalta, haven't we! Perhaps the uncertainty on timing of the split is holding the stock back, and that could will only lift in the couple weeks before the actual split?

Anything else to fire it up?

They are in the works of opening up a good number of new stores, but their EPS hasn't gone too far over the last 5 years, even with 100 new stores in place since, and comparable sales aren't looking too hot this recent quarter either. Actually, their saggy numbers almost look like the early days of the 2008 financial crisis all over again. Just sayin. 

With their new stores opening, and loyal cult of all-natural customers, I give them a very optimistic 15% growth rate. This justifies purchasing them at a PE of 15, and thus a minimum price of $21.6. I would still cringe a little even buying it at that.

I'm pretty bearish on iPhone 7 sales, which is why I sold. Perhaps I sold too soon, since Apple is no where close to reporting earnings yet. I might buy back in on Monday in my brokerage portfolio. 

I believe that Apple will run up to at least $115 before earnings are announced next month, but the stock will fall as expectations are not met. Soft sales in China will be the major disappointing factor. ",12

This was right before their earnings and due to only meeting on guidance, they dropped. The losses should be 14% because I’m bag holding it, however, I began mass selling weeklie calls before and after earnings as well as averaging down. Without consideration of my collected premiums, I’m current sitting at a cost basis of $262.

Now this is a solid company with good financials, however I’ll likely able to make up my 9.5% losses with this next play I’m about to discuss so I’m going to sell calls on my shares at the money and buy in this new play on Monday.

Pilgrims Pride Corporation (PPC) is THE largest chicken manufacturer in the United States. They also come in second on that aspect in Mexico.

PPC has been racking up debt recently which is why their stock has been declining in value. 

I’ve been watching this stock for years and a very fair price for this stock is $19 -$20, but that doesn’t mean a single thing. This baby is sweet for swing trading because it’s decently volatile. Current price targets of $23 dollars are right on the money, but not because the companies worth that. As with all stocks they tend to move with the markets and since this stock is priced fairly, that puts it in the perfect position to swell when the markets go back up within a month.

Now you’re sitting there, saying to yourself “/u/hyman_lebmen , you’re so wrong it hurts! Why would a stock that’s priced right go up any more than a percent or two? Also this is my first day on /r/wallstreetbets, I’m usually at the Buffett Buffet that is /r/investing.” 

In terms that someone such as yourself would understand, the stock is not overvalued…. At all. The low end is about $16 - $18 and the high end is $24 - $26. We’re on the fair side, with room to grow because it is not yet overvalued. There is no real fair value, the market decides that by buying and selling said stock, however that’s not to say that there isn’t a good price to get in it (which is what I’m calling fair value so you guys can keep track of what I’m talking about).

Get in preferable around $20.50, maybe wait a few days till it hits $19.85 - $20.25. Get out at the $22.30 - $23 range. 

I’m very serious about getting out at that range because anything higher than that is very risky and a huge bet, but anything lower than that and it’s almost not worth your time. Good luck guys.

TLDR: Buy PPC around $20.25 and sell once it hits $22.30 - $23.

16-09-14,52tfrg,Official WSB Survey Results are in!,"A few months ago, I made [a survey](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/4p60km/wsb_survey/) to attempt to quantify the asshattery/autism on this sub.  I asked 10 questions, that covered some pretty basic demographic info.  The survey was anonymous, but the data seems surprisingly reasonable.  

There was one question that asked about education which survey monkey broke out, by default, to be specific about which *grade* had been completed (ie: people had the option to say the most amount of schooling they completed was 2nd grade).  At first, I was annoyed by this, but I found that was actually a good check question because it let me remove obviously false answers.  There were about 5 people who entered their schooling down to the grade level.  Each of these clowns was supposedly a 75+ year old female with more than $5MM in net worth, which means that the actual respondents to those questions were probably sexually frustrated adolescent males with nothing better to do.  Accordingly, those responses were removed.

Survey Monkey did a pretty good job with everything, though I did actually have to shell out $30 to get all the results (only the first 100 are free).  So you boners are welcome for that.  Anyway, on to the survey!

#Questions:
* **1.How old are You?**
* **2.What is your gender?**
* **3.Which of the following best describes your relationship status?**
* **4.What is the highest level of education that you have completed?**
* **5.What is your approximate average household income?**
* **6.What is your approximate net worth (assets - liabilities)**
* **7.What is the total value of your household's investable assets?**
* **8.As a percentage, what portion of your investable assets are buy-and-hold or relatively long-term investments? ?**
* **9.Of your investable assets, how much is allocated to speculation, trading, gambling, and YOLOing as opposed to investing?**
* **10.How would you rate your overall risk tolerance for the following types of accounts?**

#Results:  
**1.How old are You?**

And here is [a pie chart](http://imgur.com/mqFQWdZ), with the ages over 45 combined since there were so few.   


**2.What is your gender?**

Response | Percentage | # of responses
---------|----------|----------
Female|2.1%|9
Male|97.9%|416

we don't need a pie chart to see that this data suggests this sub is 100% male and at least 2.1% full of shit. 

**Edit: Ok, [here's a chart](http://imgur.com/ZjccZuP)**


**3.Which of the following best describes your relationship status?**

Single, but cohabiting with a significant other|18.7%|79

Looks like a solid 60% of WSB is forever alone.  But with enough coke and hookers, you're never truly alone. 

**4.What is the highest level of education that you have completed?**

As I mentioned earlier, I got rid of the bullshit answers where people said they only completed 2nd grade or some nonsense.  That allowed me to remove some obviously false responses (those respondents had ALL of their responses from all questions removed, but I went through them and saw how absurd they were before chucking them).  With the remaining data, I grouped some of the education together.  That is, the initial survey differentiated between 1 and 2 years of completed college, which I just merged to say  ""some college"".

Response | Percentage | # of responses
---------|----------|----------
Some High School|3.29%|14
Completed High School|7.76%|33
Some college|27.29%|116
Completed College|40.94%|174
Some Graduate School|8.24%|35
Completed Graduate School|12.47%|53

Looks like we are some well educated mother fuckers!  

Here is another [pie chart of education attained](http://imgur.com/d8ZxCoR).

The pie charts were getting pretty crowded for these next questions so I switched to a bar chart.  The Y-axis shows the percent of respondents at each category.

**8.As a percentage, what portion of your investable assets are buy-and-hold or relatively long-term investments? ?**

The quesiton is asking, of the previous assets (in question 7), how much is invested in ""safe"", long-term investments as opposed to trading/speculating/gambling.   

This question did not have categories, but simply allowed people to enter a number between 0 and 100.  I pulled the answers into Excel and made categories for every 10% to make this data more readable.  

Response | Percentage | # of responses
---------|----------|----------
90%|71|16.71%
80%|48|11.29%
70%|40|9.41%
60%|21|4.94%
50%|36|8.47%
40%|16|3.76%
30%|20|4.71%
20%|31|7.29%
10%|29|6.82%
0%|113|26.59%

So basically ~17% of the responders (71 people) said that 90% of their investments are ""long term"".  About 27%, meanwhile, are degenerate gamblers.  But I think we knew that already. 

[Bar chart](http://imgur.com/tOEgDxF)

You can interpret this graph, roughly, as the more conservative investors on the left (with 90% or more of invested assets in long term investments) with the more aggressive traders and speculators on the right.


**9.Of your investable assets, how much is allocated to speculation, trading, gambling, and YOLOing as opposed to investing?**

This is sort of the opposite question as the last one, but I asked in terms of dollars instead of percent to try to ask the question a different way.  We would expect, for instance, that if someone had $100k in investable assets (q7) and allocated 90% to buy and hold investing (q8) then they should have responded ""$10,000"" this question.

Response | Percentage | # of responses
---------|----------|----------
Less than $1,000|28.2%|120
$1,000 to $2,499|20.2%|86
$2,500 to $4,999|14.1%|60
$5,000 to $9,999|13.4%|57
$10,000 to $24,999|11.3%|48
$25,000 to $49,999|4.5%|19
$50,000 to $99,000|3.3%|14
$100,000 to $499,999|1.2%|5
$500,000 to $999,999|0.5%|2
$1,000,000 or more|3.3%|14

[Bar chart](http://imgur.com/akXhtdc)


**10.How would you rate your overall risk tolerance for the following types of accounts?**

This question aimed to figure out people's different risk tolerances for different types of accounts/trading styles.  My assumption was that most people have some safe assets that they do just park in index funds or whatever and they probably aren't prepared to lose all of that, but that they also have some fun money or even medium term trading money that they would tolerate a much higher draw-down on.  

Answer Options | Very conservative | Moderately conservative | Moderately Aggressive | Very aggressive | N/A - does not apply
---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------
Long-term investing|75|148|82|61|56
Trading|64|128|96|98|34
Speculation/YOLO|54|60|75|209|25

I defined ""aggressive/conservative"" as follows:  
Very conservative - a 10% draw down would make me nervous  	 
Moderately conservative - I could handle a draw down of up to 25% comfortably	  
Moderately Aggressive - I could handle a draw down of 40%	  
Very Aggressive - 50%+ drawdowns don't phase me	  

[Here is the graph](http://imgur.com/mQp2KnZ)


So there you have it.  It's about what I think most of us expected: younger, educated males who are mostly single and upper/middle class (or still poor because they are in college) with mostly safe investments and some ""fun"" money - along with one contingent of degenerate gamblers.  Discuss and go fuck yourselves. ",149

16-09-14,52re9l,Life Cycle of an Order,"https://www.scottrade.com/online-brokerage/trade-quality-execution/life-cycle-of-an-order.html

A lot of investors don't fully understand how orders work. I found the above graphic to be really useful from Scottrade, so I thought I'd plug it today.

The important tidbit is #3: notice that a limit order may be immediately marketable.

Today, AAPL is at $112.60. If you do a limit order for ""Buy AAPL@ $150"", this will be ""immediately marketable"" and effectively function like a market order.

This is important in times of high volatility: if AAPL skyrockets for some reason to $160 (unlikely... but some of the more volatile stocks may move like this), the $150 market order will turn into a non-marketable order, and entered into the order books.

For this reason, I suggest never using a market order and instead always use a marketable limit order. If you REALLY want to buy Apple (currently $112), put in a limit order at $130 or $140. As high as you're comfortable with.

If you are willing to sell Apple, put in a limit order at $110 or $100. As low as you're comfortable with.

Because lets be frank: if the market moves under your feet and AAPL drops to $50 or something, you might be happier keeping the stock rather than selling it. [Flash Crashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Flash_Crash) happen and its best to protect yourself with a reasonable limit order.

-------

Another note: it is important to remember that when trading for real, each trade has a buyer and a seller. The markets are designed to match you up with a seller (if you're buying), or a buyer (if you're selling).

Your ""partner"" in the trade (found in step #4 in the graphic) may not necessarily be at the stock market: but instead be a Market Maker, or in an ""Alternative Trade System"".

-------------

Why is this important? In this day and age of HFT and online trading, it is sometimes easy to forget that out there, there is a human who has decided to make a trade with you.

The human may have programmed a computer to trade for him (IE: HFT), but it is important to remember that each trade has consequences. After all, the seller will no longer have the stock, and the buyer will have the stock after the trade.

Its also important to recognize the difference between the ""NBO"" (National Best Offer) price and the ""NBB"" (National Best Bid) price. The ""[bid-ask spread](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp)"" so to speak.

Really study how orders work, and be sure you understand how the stock market actually works! Good luck with your investments.",9

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/zMPKw) is a screenshot of my filtration scheme on finviz.

I have noticed my filtration almost always throws up lesser known banks and some oil&amp;gas companies. I have observed the same trend many times in the past few months.

I can intuitively justify why oil&amp;gas shows up as stock prices of these companies have fallen recently making them seem attractive, but can someone explain why only banks come up on this screener and not other categories like commodities or tech etc?",8
16-09-14,52rmjk,WSE:CDR. CD Project. A video game developing company - A long-term investment.,"I was looking at their history, and it seems that they've just gone up and up after each released title. It went down from one of their first witcher game - but then startet rising a lot since witcher 2, and seem to be growing even more with their latest title, Witcher 3.

They have lately been hiring people to work on their next project, it is called ""Cyberpunk 2077"". And as usual, the stocks should grow again after the release, which I presume will be in 2-3 years (2018-2019).

So I was thinking. Is it such a good idea to invest now, or should I wait a little bit more until the stocks have went much more (buying in 2017 or something). Or perhaps investing into video game developers is not such a good idea? I was thinking perhaps when it comes to AAA-games, there should be little risk, since it is mostly up to the marketing team. It seems that they know what they're doing, and that the game should do quite well in the future. But I'd like to hear your opinions.",1

I think that this company is a pile of shit, but has the potential make you a little bit of money. You see, they somehow managed to get a CRL a while back from the FDA for a combination pill of Aspirin and Omeprazol (Prilosec), two drugs that have been proven to be very safe, are available in generic form, and can be bought over the counter. They were rejected for having trouble meeting guidelines set by the FDA at their overseas manufacturing plant. I don't know how hard it is to make a those drugs, but if walgreens can do it I am hopeful that these buffoons can too.

So why am I gambling this? Well, the FDA inspected their plant four months ago and said it was up to standards. Awesome. Their PDUFA goal date was today, but the company did not receive word on whether or not the drug was finally approved from the FDA. Thus, a bunch of people panic sold during the day and after hours today, driving the stock price down about 23%, assuming that the drug was once again rejected. Now you see, I am doubtful that this is the case. It's freaking aspirin and a proton pump inhibitor, available to go buy right now. Also, the FDA not giving their word on time definitely does not mean that a drug is rejected. Besides all of that, the geniuses at stocktwats are crying CRL, so I *must* be on to something with this minor YOLO.

Lets say the average shareholder on WSB has access to $40,000 of liquid ASSets. 

If only 10,000 of our 272,825 subscribers on this were active;

we'd have 400,000,000 (four-hundred-million) of liquid assets. 

The AMD stock trades at roughly $6.00 (12:30 PM, Sept 14th) and has an average daily volume of 19.47M.

19.47 x 6.00/share = is $116,820,000

400,000,000/6.00 = 6,666,666.67 (the devils number)

If we invested all of our liquid assets, we could have an impact on the average daily volume of AMD by a factor 17.5%.

Of course, Credit Suisse will be trolling our mad gainz with their fooking guerrilla algorithm. IF WE SHEEP HARD ENOUGH WE CAN STILL GET OUT ON TOP.

In doing so, I'm swinging the pendulum more towards mid-/small-cap relative to the total market, as they have historically out-performed large-cap stocks. 

My two questions are as follows: 

1) Does swinging my US equity more towards small- and mid-cap make sense given the historical trends or is there reason to believe that an allocation in line with the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (i.e. approximately 70% large and 30% mid-/small-) would be the smarter approach for the coming 30-40 years? (Obviously no one knows for sure, but I just want to make sure I'm not making a false step in my reasoning.)

2) Should I place more emphasis on value stocks funds, as those have historically out-performed growth stocks, or is the difference between VOO and VXF and their value-heavy counterparts negligible?

(For context: I'm 28; I have about $60,000 invested and will soon add another $50,000 to my portfolio within the next few weeks. I am comfortable with high risk, as I don't intend to touch any of this money for the next 30-40 years. Aside from my 70% US index funds, I'm putting 10% in VXUS, 10% VWO, and 10% VNQ.)",2

I recently put my two weeks in at my current job due to the fact that I could not bear it.  It was a call center and I could not stand the constant nastiness of clients calling in and the lack of help from coworkers in other departments (who would not help out even after explaining I was new because 'its not technically their job'). I am a recent college grad who obtained my Series 7 license and was wondering what possibilities there are for me.  I was wondering if there was any way to work from home having this license? Also, is there any sort of part time work I could do that would hold my license? Any sort of shadowing of an advisor that I could do for about a year to really solidify my knowledge in the business? Thanks.  ",1

16-09-14,52sbde,Stocks that have low volatility and are mildly correlated with the market are the best stocks to write calls against.,"As many of you know, I'm a JNJ bagholder. Over the past month, I've made about $600 writing calls against my position of 1,759 shares. 

I keep an eye on it daily... so much so now, that I'm going to change my strategy about writing calls, since JNJ barely moves outside of earnings or major market corrections. This past month, I've been writing calls with strikes of $124/$125. Going forward, my plan is to write slightly out of the money calls below my purchase price of $123.20. 

Right now, 9/23 $119 calls are being sold at a $0.53 bid. If sell 17 contracts right now, I'll get around $900 before commission. 

Granted, the calls will be worth a bit less by the time next Monday rolls around, so I might make just $750 when I actually write the contract. 

My plan is to keep writing slightly OTM covered calls every Monday until earnings come around next month. I believe that the market will continue to trend downwards.

If JNJ makes a huge move and my shares get exercised, no biggie, I'll take the money and put it into something else. But if the market keeps going negative or neutral, I could make a few grand a month off my position - enough that I might make enough money by next year to sell all my shares of JNJ without incurring a loss. 

I don't like bagholding, but having such a huge position and writing calls on it regularly really teaches you how options move on certain stocks. ",18

I have a few questions for those who have much more insight than myself. I have looked into it but would like second opinions on what I have read online.

Background on myself:

 I am 17 years old, 31 on the ACT, sociable, and am comfortable in fast paced environments. I am very much motivated by money and enjoy picking out trends and patterns. I've been paper trading for a few weeks with great success in Gold miners and Oil. My apologies if there is too much information in an already long post.

Questions:

I want to work as a floor trader and eventually start my own firm. Is this reasonable?

Are floor trading jobs easy to come by?

What is the most ideal major / minor combination for college?

How are the salaries in this line of work? Bonuses?  Benefits?

Are there any other careers that I should consider that might be better?

Are there any other things I should know before I begin to apply to colleges and proceed with my career?

My apologies if this is in the wrong place, or these questions are dumb (for lack of a better word). Also sorry for the long winded nature of this post and if the formatting was poor. This is my future, and I want to use every available resource. Thank you very much to anyone who reads or replies to this. ",9

We all called him 'crazy' and 'bimbo' and whatnot, but after today's EIA report and subsequent market reaction to it, I'm pretty sure he's right. 

Today's EIA petroleum report showed crude stock change at -.559 (the consensus estimate was 3.800). Even though we have a shortage of crude, CRUDE PRICES STILL WENT DOWN.

As a result, my UWTI position got boned in the rear. Basic economics tells us if supply goes down with no change in demand, then price should go up. YET THE MARKET HAS DONE THE EXACT OPPOSITE.

16-09-15,52vgn4,"Why it's a good time to buy shares of $AHS right now","DD on AMN Healthcare ($AHS)

9/14/16

Current Share Price: $33.97

AMN Healthcare is a small cap healthcare staffing company. AMN Healthcare Services Inc. (NYSE: AHS) ranks as the largest healthcare staffing firm in the US in terms of  revenue, according to Staffing Industry Analysts' 2016 report on the largest healthcare staffing firms.  They have the highest annual net income in the staffing industry, and an 11% market share. 

Income Statement: AMN Healthcare’s annual revenue increased by over $400 million from 2014 to 2015. Their net income increased by almost $50 million from 2014 to 2015. Net income has been steadily increasing over the past 3 quarters. AMN’s income statement shows consistent growth over the past few years.

Balance Sheet: AMN Healthcare has $301 million in current liabilities. They have $442 million in current assets. This shows that the company can easily pay off current liabilities. The company has $777 million in total liabilities, and $1.18 billion in total assets

Projected Earnings: AMN Healthcare’s 2016 earnings are expected to grow 41.06% from their 2015 earnings. Their earnings are expected to grow 12% over the next 5 years. AMN’s EPS is expected to be 2.78 in 2018, 0.45 higher than their 2016 EPS

Statistics: PEG ratio - 1.30. This number shows that AHS is slightly undervalued at its current price

Quarterly revenue growth (yoy) - 35.30%

Quarterly Earnings Growth (yoy) - 65.90%

% of Shares Held by Institutional and Mutual Fund Owners - 93%. Shows a strong professional interest in this company

Management

Number of shares held by current CEO -  288,688

The current CEO Susan Salka has been a key executive of AMN Healthcare for 26 years

Return on assets - 10.85%

Return on Equity - 30.68%

AMN Healthcare has an effective management team that’s dedicated to growing the company

Technicals:
 52 week high - $44.99
52 week low - $21.24
3 Month Average Volume - 885.86k. This stock has high liquidity.

On August 3rd, AHS started a downtrend that would last for 12 days. On August 3rd the stock closed at $43.47. On August 15th it closed at $35.49. The stock has not had any big price movements since. This is a good stock to buy right now because there was recently a large dip, and the price hasn’t bounced back.

AHS has been on a steady uptrend since 2011. 

AHS earnings date is Nov 2-7. If they beat their earnings (they have the past 4 quarters), the stock price is going to shoot up. I also believe there'll be an uptrend leading up to earnings

Conclusion: I know a lot of people here don't like to hold stock for more than a few weeks, but if you buy into AHS right now and hold out until the beginning of november, you'll make sick gains

16-09-15,52x354,Stock ideas for my finance/investment class?,"First time posting here and I apologize now because I know very little about investing and stocks etc. I have a group project in the class and we are tasked with picking several different ETFs (we can only pick ETFs) and tracking them. We get extra credit on our final exam if we have the highest returns on our stocks so I was thinking that it might be best to invest in some stocks that although might not be good long term, may see a large amount of success in the next few months. An example I came up with was investing in ATVI (Activision and Blizzard). They are already both successful gaming companies, however they are both either coming out with a new game, or recently came out with a new game that is popular. Activision is releasing the new Call of Duty which includes a remastered version of an older and extremely popular call of duty, which I think will convince a lot of people who may have not been buying Call of Duty anymore to consider buying it. Blizzard just released a new expansion for World of Warcraft, as well as recently released their new game, Overwatch. Based on these releases I feel that these companies overall sales will go up in the next few months and will see good returns. Do you guys have any other tips for a stock that you feel will see high returns, even for a short period of time?",1

In that episode guest speaker David Swenson talks about the high opportunity costs of US treasuries. What he says is that it is not the best long term strategy to own a substantial amount of US treasury bonds due to their high opportunity costs.

Can somebody explain this to me? My understanding of this is that in the long term stocks perform better than bonds and so bonds will only decrease the performance of one's portfolio.
Does that mean that it doesn't make sense to buy bonds in the long term? Where can I find more about this topic?

I used to post on /r/investing a lot, but I hate how conservative and value oriented everyone is there. Frequently, posters asking for legitimate advice are told to buy some Vanguard funds and that's it. 

Want to speculate? People there will tell you it's dumb. At least on here, people will tell it's dumb, why it's dumb, but that you should go for it anyway, because YOLO. 

People on /r/investing also forget that speculation is a form of investing, it's investing with a shorter timeframe. 

Granted, there is some good discussion there on general economics, and there are a lot of people that know what they are talking about, but sometimes the atmosphere can be stifling.

#Compounding.


I have turned 50% gains into 60% gains, simply by compounding numerous times. It's called *forced compounding*, and if you balance commissions with expected returns, you can see some sick bonuses to your performance.


Yes, I pay commissions. I'm not a fucking robinhoodrat


So let's say you buy Tesla. Your shares are now up 10% because Elon Must is a god. Sell your shares, then buy Tesla again.


Over the next week, no cars caught fire, so you're sitting on another 10% gain.

If that happens five times overall, you're up 61% instead of 50%.


**TL;DR:** close your wins out early so you can reinvest your gains",0

16-09-16,530ghb,"Please tell me there's something wrong with this covered call strategy","Sorry if this has been asked before. I'm new to options and I'm noodling the idea of selling weekly covered calls with relatively stable underlying stocks. I've been doing the math and it seems worthwhile, but I'm probably missing something. Here are my numbers.

------------------------------------------------

$50,000 - available funds

$57.19 - current share price

$.44 - option premium at the money ($57.50) expiring in 1 week 

$4.95 - brokerage commission

------------------------------------------------


800 - number of shares bought with the funds

8 - number of contracts to sell

------------------------------------------------


$.44 * 800 - $4.95 = $347.05 (weekly profit w/o assignment)

347.05 * 48(# of trading weeks in a year) = $16,658.40

16,658.40 / 50,000 = 33.32% (Yearly ROI)

------------------------------------------------



The stock in the above scenario is MSFT. The plan is to choose 5 stocks each weak so I can spread the risk. Something like a GE or INTC. From my understanding, things can play out a few ways.

1. The option expires and I keep the entire premium and shares. Cool!
2. The option is exercised and I keep the entire premium and make a little on top due to OTM. Very Cool! I'm completely OK missing out on the extra profit. Then I'd either buy the same stock again or another stock and selling calls on those.
3. One or two of the underlying stock plummets. In this case, depending on how low it goes, I'd buy back the option and dump the shares. Or maybe hold on to them and keep selling calls on them next week.
4. The entire market tanks. In this case, I'd probably just hold everything and wait for the world to end.

I must be missing something but I have no idea what it is. 33% is too good to be true. I've been racking my brain and reading as much as I can for the last few days. Please tell me I'm insane. ",2

# Description
Selective Insurance Group sells insurance to Businesses (77% of sales) to Consumers (14% of sales) and non-standard insurance is the rest. The business division operates in 22 states in the Eastern and Midwestern U.S. and the District of Columbia through approximately 1,100 distribution partners in the standard marketplace.


## Recent financials 

SIGI's had a steady increase in sales, driven by writing more and more insurance business. And the earnings have been stellar, with the business seeing a swing from an underwriting losses 5 years ago to nice underwriting profits today.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $2.1bn | $2.0bn | $1.9bn | $1.7bn | $1.6bn|
|EPS | $2.85 | $2.47 | $1.87 | $0.68 | $0.40|

If you've no idea what I mean...well insurance companies typically make money in two ways:

* investment income on all the cash they are sitting on
* underwriting: collecting more insurance premiums than they have to pay out in claims

Some companies are willing to lose money on the underwriting... and make it back in the investment income. Though Buffett has long prided himself on profiting in both sides!

## Competition

When it comes to naming the competition they list:  Cincinnati Financial Corporation, Erie Indemnity Company, The Hanover Insurance Group, Inc., United Fire Group, Inc.; The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., Liberty Mutual Holding Company Inc., Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, The Travelers Companies, Inc., and Zurich Insurance Group, Ltd.

They go onto to point out that bigger firms may have a lower cost of capital that SIGI and many others don't have to rely on partners for distribution.

So with that in mind, the lower margin is understandable. And the higher return on equity is a pleasant surprise!

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Selective Insurance Group | $2,222M | 15% | 12%
Cincinnati Financial Corporation | $5,276M | 19% | 10%
Erie Indemnity Company | $1,552M | 17% | 24%
Hanover Insurance Group Inc | $4,936M | 32% | 8%
United Fire Group, Inc. | $1,087M | 29% | 8%
Hartford Financial Services Group Inc | $18,261M | 20% | 7%
Travelers Companies Inc | $27,004M | 35% | 13%
Allstate Corp | $36,274M | 22% | 8%
Progressive Corp | $22,030M | 17% | 14%

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $41.67 for Selective Insurance Group and their recommendation to clients is _Hold_. That implies an upside of 6% to their target.

So it's as if Wall Street think the stories done, and we can move on!

# Valuation

But looking at the peers, we can see that the valuation is at the low end versus other regional players like CINF and ERIE, and in line with the majors like TRV and ALL. Given the recent track record, it's hard to see the growth of SIGI being worse than the market. In fact they appear to have grown a little faster historically, yes?

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/sigi.o/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|

# Dividends
Selective Insurance Group is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.62 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $0.59 per share. That is a 5% growth. The forecast dividend of $0.62 compares to a forecast EPS of $2.75. So plenty of room there to boost returns to shareholders.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 6% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 3%. And looking back 12 months, the price hasn't rocketed ahead of earnings. i.e. valuation's been stable in the 12 to 14x range.

What's surprising to me in the data is that [Wall Street](http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/analyst?symbol=SIGI.O) thinks EPS in 2017 will be lower than in 2016 ($2.59 v $2.75). Though CINF is forecast to see a decline too. Is that really the case? Is it some FED related issue?

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, just 2 brokers turned up. 

&gt; In the first half of 2016, many key metrics across the organization improved and we are ahead of last year’s record pace. As we focus on underwriting and claims improvements as well as achieving rate increases that match or exceed expected claim inflation. Year-to-date our annualized operating return on equity was 11%, 320 basis points above our weighted average cost of capital as net premiums written grew 9% and we delivered 26% increase in operating earnings per share.

It's hard to not like the sound of that! Even if it's insurance speak ;)

16-09-16,52z8qd,Why TWTR is a dumpster fire [MSPAINT DD],"So Twitter is currently fucking up the live fucking streaming of the god damned NFL. Everyone who says they have incompetent management is absofuckinglutely right, and the center of that fuckup is Mr CEO himself Jack Dorsey.  Either Twitter needs to be bought out or the board needs to drop him like a bad habit.  

Here's three easy ways to generate revenue:

1. Live stream the fucking tweets. What is this god damn click to reload.  I ain't clicking shit.

2. Automagically provide big-brother style advertisements relevant to your post, search, and intimate private conversations

3. Use that god damned white space to show off to hype another product you could possibly benefit from (HMMM LIKE A BIG FUCKING SQUARE AD)

4. Here's a shit simple bonus because Twitter is fucking up so motherfucking badly: when you go full screen **KEEP SHOWING YOUR MAIN FUCKING PRODUCT, YOUR GOD DAMNED TWITTER STREAM**.  I mean its bad enough these fucks ignored the free real estate for advertisements that every fucking media company worth a dime already uses. Nope instead I go clickety click full screen and ignore whatever the fuck a twitter is.  FREE NFL!!!11

Based on this analysis, I'm going dick sucking short on TWTR until Jack Dorsey is out and a leader who knows how to fucking use their resources is brought in.

EDIT: So the mobile experience is much better.  I half retract my statements but still stand by the exile of that hipster neck beard.

Accrued salaries and wages went down by like by like 200 million in the quarterly report. They're either paying people less or they just fired a bunch of people.

They're long term debt did not move. Bad (Did not pay that shit off last quarter)

However, their net cash used by investing activities went up, need to read notes to find out why. But that's probably a good thing. 

Basically, I can see why their shares are taking a dump. Everything else does look good though, their business model is great. But, if whatever crisis they're facing continues, that might make it a shitty yolo. (Googling suggests something about fuel margins fucking them up?) 

but consistent solid fundamentals good long term financials show that KO is probably going to bounce up. More so if interest rates stay down.

Some highlights from the article

&gt; strongest four-day percentage increase since April 2014, when Apple surged 12.9 percent over four days after the company increased its share buybacks and announced better-than-expected quarterly results.

&gt; Apple has been entirely responsible for this week's gains in the Dow Jones industrial average. If Apple had been unchanged this week from last Friday's close, the Dow on Thursday would be down 0.1 percent, instead of the 0.3 percent gain it has recorded

&gt; Faced with the stock's rapid ascent, short sellers on Thursday covered $250 million in bets against Apple, bringing the total reduction in Apple short interest this week to $600 million, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm.

Here's what I think I know from my few minutes of digging.  

XIV tracks the inverse of volatility on the S&amp;P?  If it deviates too  much from the market, there are apparently wholesalers ready to arbitrage (am I using this right?) to correct it, so any real understanding of it better include a way to track it with the market.  Are there tools for doing this?  You would track the inverse of the S&amp;P, and overlay that on the XIV?  How?

""Yes, the system is rigged, just not in the way that 99% of the people think it is and not by those
they think are doing the rigging. Greed is not the reason for the rigging, nor are any of the other
usual “follow the money” reasons. We cannot make a convenient demon out of Wall Street or the
big banks and investment banking houses. The real culprits are far less sinister and are actually
sincere in their motives, so you won’t see an Oliver Stone movie about the conspiracy to defraud
the middle class and strip them of their hard-earned retirement savings. No, the “bad guys” in the
story are just Nobel laureates, tenured professors, and other honorable members of the economic
academic establishment, what Ken Rogoff calls the “policy community.” The Occupy Wall Street
crowd had a right to be angry, but they should have been demonstrating in front of the economics
schools at Harvard, MIT, Princeton, Yale, etc. You know, the schools that many of those Occupy
Wall Street protesters themselves attend. ""

...

""Let me make it clear that if somehow or other I was made the Head Philosopher King and decided
to allow the markets to set interest rates, the ensuing volatility and problematic markets would be
serious for more than a few months. My idealistic move would likely precipitate a serious
recession as markets adjusted. There is no magic wand to get us to normal. If there were, I’m
pretty sure the Federal Reserve would wave it at once, because I think everybody realizes that rates
should already have been normalized – and that to do so now is going to be problematic. We really
have come to a place where there are no good choices""

...

""The next 10 years will see an explosion of government debt and an implosion of the ability of
governments to fulfill their promises. Any economic or investment model based on past
performance under previous economic conditions will be worthless. As in, just as worthless as the
Federal Reserve’s models. We are truly going to have to go outside of the box if we are going to
figure out how to get our portfolios from where we are today to the other side of the coming crisis.
There is truly no way to predict what our investment portfolios should look like six months or one
year or two years or six years from now. """,7

16-09-16,531tgh,2 Reasons Why This Choppy Stock Market Means Nothing To Smart Investors,"The stock market has seen a return of volatility in September. Investors are scambling to figure out if the markets are going back to their all-time highs or collapsing lower. The simple answer? This is chop to take your hard earned money. It is mostly games by the institutions, being headed by top hedge fund managers that want to make money after coming back to work from vacation over the summer and an end to the 3rd quarter.

 

1. It Is Options Expiration Week

 

Understand that it is options expiration and the return to volatility gives institutions an easy way to take money from investors and pad their bottom line. Remember, the summer was dead so they are smelling blood (easy money) in the water. Let me explain how this works. Institutions sell a majority of options (puts/calls) to investors. Investors pay a premium to the seller in order to buy the option. For example, an investor pays $3 for an at the money MSFT call options. Since it is at the money, they are paying a $3 premium. Obviously, it is in the best interest of the institution to have that option contract expire worthless, because they make the entire profit. The week of options expiration is the best week to create ups and downs in the stock market. Mainly because the big boys (institutions) sucker the small investor into making crazy options bets and paying higher premiums. REMEMBER, this is the last options expiration before the 3rd quarter comes to a close. These institutions are padding their quarterly earnings in a major way. Ultimately, until this week passes, don't make too much out of the ups and downs in the stock market.

 

2. The Federal Reserve Gives Their Statement Next Week

 

While the market is shooting up and down wildly over the last week, it ultimately means nothing. Why? Because next Wednesday investors will hear from the Federal Reserve on interest rates. This has been the whole reason the stock market has been worried, therefore it is likely all the ups/downs are junk until we actually get real word from the Federal Reserve. Don't get too worried or excited until next Wednesday at 2pm ET.",13

CRK, a oil and natural gas company in Texas. It has seen the dip (sorry you missed it) but it has still significant room for growth. Currently priced 8$ a share.

Catalysts: Since the beginning of 2016 positive numbers, paying their debts can be seen in their balance sheet. There are a lot of promising things happening with this stock. They produce below their competitors which is a huge plus. With the increase in oil prices the company started seeing the daylight, however the real blow will come with natural gas prices. Nat gas is still fairly undervalued, with great expectations going into 2017 (also, pray for a cold winter).

There is no random walk in stocks.  There are guppies, dolphins, whales, and leviathans in all markets.  The leviathans move their stacks and the tides of the sea shift to accommodate their  displaced bulk.  The whales react by scampering about and claiming the newly freed territory, while also backing away from the crushing weight of their leviathan elders.  
  
But the dolphins?  They sense something is amiss, but can't put their fingers on it.  They can almost glimpse the reason why the waves have shifted, but the truth is a couple of orders of magnitude beyond them.  
  
And for the guppies?  Yeah, they are playing the equivalent of a 1000-man game of liars dice with a single die.  They don't know anything and for them the movement of the water is a chaotic storm, constantly shifting and attempting to swallow them whole.

16-09-16,534sh8,You wanna yolo against/for the fed?,"Oil has the biggest range of movement here.

Oil has been taking a beating for the past two weeks despite a hurricane threat slowing inventory builds.  If the supply delayed by the hurricane hits at the same time as a rate hike, oil gets the ole double whammy and XLE goes back into the 50s, imo.

Even if the fed doesn't raise, the end of the year is shaky for oil companies in bad times.  They have to reprice reserves at the end of every year which affects their credit.

I think you could get far OTM put spreads on oil companies with high debt loads or oil ETFs past the first of the year and wait for the gains.

You could've gotten 55/54 long put spread for January on XLE today for about a dime.  Even if the fed doesn't raise next week, any prospective rate hike looms over oil due to the increase in dollar value associated with it.  Dollar up, oil down.  I don't think we have to worry about domestic oil going much higher for the rest of the year, so this is a relatively risk-less trade until you get into late October, November, December.  Short of ISIS invading the Saudis (jinxed it) the good news for domestic oil comes in the summer and dwindles through the end of the year, typically.

So even if it doesn't go all rocket ship right away, I'd say decent odds of getting your 10 cents back before the end of the year.

I know you bitches are real busy giving your money to penny stock biopharm pumpers but you might take 10 minutes out of refreshing the latest dumpster fire you've loaded up on for a potential 5-10 bagger with relatively low risk, imo.

For U.S.-based dividend investors, is allocating some capital towards foreign dividends ""worth it""?

Plenty of large multi-national US companies pay dividends. These dividends are taxed less at the qualified income tax, while plenty of revenue these companies derive come from all over the world. Focusing on dividends from these US multi-nationals makes things easy. Taxes are easy, and investing is cheaper (e.g. many US-only ETFs have lower expense ratios than foreign equity ones).

However, plenty of non-US companies from all over the world pay dividends as well. Is allocating capital to these companies ""worth it""?

There is foreign withholding of dividend income for U.S. investors, up to 35% in some cases. While the IRS lets you offset this with tax credits, it's additional and possibly unnecessary paperwork, particularly for high-net worth investors who receive foreign dividends over a certain amount.

I understand that there's a potential diversification benefit from owning foreign company stocks, dividends or no dividend, but with the amount of revenue these US companies derive overseas and the relatively tax straightforwardness of US-derived dividend income, is that potential diversification benefit worth the extra complexity in making sure every foreign dividend received is offset come tax time? Add to this that global equity markets are becoming more and more correlated over time,....

Personally, if a U.S. investor is primarily focused on generating dividend income, I am leaning towards owning a U.S. only portfolio with enough multi-nationals such that, at least indirectly, what happens abroad still affects your portfolio.

Cheatsheet: You must hold it 20 years to get ~3.5% annual risk-free return, gains exempt from state and local tax. If sold for educational expenses and the seller has under a certain income, no federal tax. No inflation protection. 

It sounds more like a pricing mistake + tax incentive than an investment. It's limited to $10k investment per taxpayer per year, and the ""your money doubles at 20 year"" clause seems like an oversight they forgot to repeal in the 2000s.

The one big downside to me is the low liquidity. I won't need the money for 20 years, but you can't sell it in a downturn to rebalance equities, for instance.

After having a recent conversation in our forums, I came across a definition of ""cis"" through a google search as a person who identifies as their birth of gender. 

Upon investigation, I came to realize this shit smear of a word, is actually a legitimized culture of people who actually believe they ""identify"" as a variety of genders with of course optimum fluidity much like my micro dick that remains flaccid until Buy high Sell low opportunities are available. 

THUS, I have begun development on BinaryInvest, a revolutionary platform that will focus on gender fluid trading offering the highest possible prices for shares with the lowest possible returns while also allowing investors to escape ""patronizing stockbrokers"" and ""triggering events"" that may lead to more PTSD.

# Description
The Kroger operates retail food and drug stores, multi-department stores, jewelry stores and convenience stores across the United States. The Company operates, 2,778 retail food stores under a range of local banner names, approximately 1,387 of which have fuel centers. The Company's supermarkets are operated under combination food and drug stores (combo stores), multi-department stores, marketplace stores or price impact warehouses. 

## Recent financials 

The year end is January, oddly. Regardless, it's seen a steady increase in sales and a remarkable increase in earnings. Though bizarrely the dividend hasn't kept up with the earnings growth.

|Jan-end |2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $110bn | $108bn | $98bn | $97bn | $90bn|
|EPS | $2.06 | $1.72 | $1.45 | $1.39 | $0.51|
|DPS | $0.40 | $0.34 | $0.31 | $0.25 | $0.22|

The overall growth in 2016A of 1% masks the remarkable growth of 6% in the non-fuel business (up to $91bn) versus the petrol business that fell 22% to $15bn. Imagine... even boring old retailer get a kick in the teeth from the oil price!

## Competition

When talking about their competition...

&gt; The operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition, aggressive expansion, increasing fragmentation of retail and online formats, entry of non-traditional competitors and market consolidation.  

... and the list of names isn't that surprising.

What is odd though, is their margins are low but returns are high. Possibly an indicator of a really efficiently run business?

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Kroger Co | $111,383M | 3% | 33%
Costco Wholesale Corporation | $117,937M | 4% | 21%
CVS Health Corp | $166,730M | 7% | 13%
SUPERVALU INC. | $17,318M | 4% | N/A
Target Corporation | $71,604M | 10% | 25%
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. | $483,833M | 7% | 19%
Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc | $117,237M | 7% | 10%
Whole Foods Market, Inc. | $15,666M | 8% | 13%

## Cash / Debt?

Kroger Co has $12,101M of net debt. That is 2.1x its latest operating profit. That's a little higher than I'd like but it's not dangerous.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $36.52 for Kroger Co and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 17% to their target.

# Valuation

It's clearly not an expensive stock, and it's been growing nicely at the bottom line. So, if you are inclined to invest in retail how do you judge a stock like KR versus Target? Sure you aren't buying a market darling. But you aren't paying for one, are you!

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/kr/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|

WFM.O | $9,092M | 19x | 4% | 2% | 12%

# Dividends

Kroger Co is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.46 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $0.40 per share. The forecast dividend of $0.46 compares to a forecast EPS of $2.14. But they are happily buying back stock too!

&gt; We made open market purchases of our common shares totaling $500 million in 2015, $1.1 billion in 2014 and $338 million in 2013.

# Recent Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -11% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -4%. On a 6 months view the stocks off 20% with earnings downgraded 5%. So sentiments clearly turned against KR.

On management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers they pulled in guidance by circa 5% and indicated that this year's margin may decline versus last year. The also were cautious about capital expenditures, suggesting they should rein in some projects, and focus on returning more capital to shareholders.

So it's no wonder the stock's taken a breather. Perhaps KR today is a ""cheap"" Quality stock?

16-09-16,533rhd,Recession Watch. How does it effect your investments?,"Greetings Everyone,


First time poster here as I begin to understand in depth the art of investing and the economy. I'd rather not get into a heated debate about who is right or wrong. I am more interested in an investment strategy if a full blown recession is our near future. I have money in a managed retirement account and would like to discuss options on short/long term plans. I posted a link below on an analysis on recession chances. Its not a mainstream, CNBC, article if that matters.


Q: If there is a high probability of a recession, would it make sense to cash out now, and wait until the market falls (10-30%) to buy in? I know its impossible to time but would it make sense to be early than late. 

Q: If the next recession turns out to be worst than 2008, why would i stick with a long term plan when in the short term i could lose 20-40% of its value, requiring I wait 5-10+ years before it rebounds to break even.

Q: Do you think we wont enter a recession anytime soon?

16-09-16,533smc,Apple has Best Streak in 2 Years - Time to Short?,"In a rough week for stocks,  Apple Inc.  has soared.
Shares in the  Cupertino, Calif. -based company were on track to rise 11% this week, after posting their best four- day streak in more than two years.  Apple  was the top performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Thursday and the only stock in the blue-chip index to gain during a selloff Tuesday that sent the Dow industrials down 1.4%.
Technology shares also have been rallying broadly. Tech stocks in the  S&amp;P  500 have risen roughly 10% in the past three months, more than twice the gains of any other group. That is also a change from earlier in the year, when a dive in tech highlighted investor concerns about slowing U.S. growth.
 Apple  has been a big driver of those recent gains. Excluding  Apple  would cut the tech sector's monthly gain through Thursday from 1.5% to 0.2%, according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, which notes  Apple  remains the biggest company in the index by market cap.
 Apple  was the most-active stock in both the Dow industrials and  S&amp;P  500 on Thursday, gaining  $3.80 , or 3.4%, to  $ 115.57 . Shares retreated 0.9% on Friday after having risen 12% over the previous four sessions.
 Apple's  strong week follows a recent stumble. Shares fell almost 5% in the two days after last Wednesday's iPhone 7 unveiling, briefly sliding into negative territory for 2016. Some reviewers said the phone offered only incremental improvements over previous versions, such as better battery life and water resistance, instead of dramatic new features. The removal of the phone's headphone jack was also a polarizing decision.
But early adopters showed up as usual.  Apple  said it already had sold out of some versions of the new phone since preorders started last week. That came after  T-Mobile  and  Sprint  earlier this week suggested demand was strong, without giving numbers. Shoppers lined up to buy the new phones Friday.
Meanwhile,  Samsung Electronics Co.  is recalling its competing Galaxy Note 7 smartphone because of battery fires.
Several investors and analysts said hints of strong iPhone sales were reassuring after sales fell for two consecutive quarters.
""This shows that the user base is loyal and wants to upgrade either when new tech comes along or when their new phones wear out,"" said  Jim Tierney , chief investment officer for concentrated U.S. growth at  AllianceBernstein Holding LP , which holds  Apple  shares.
 Apple  didn't respond to a request for comment.
 Apple's  6.7% climb between the new phone's unveiling and Thursday's close is the stock's best performance over the past five years in the gap between the announcement and the launch, according to data from  Bespoke Investment Group . Since the iPhone first was unveiled in 2007, shares have gained a median of 4.3% in that window, climbing seven times and falling three, Bespoke says.
The data also shows the stock sometimes cools off in the weeks after, falling five times and rising four, posting a median decline of 1.7%, according to Bespoke.
Some investors and analysts said  Apple  still has room to run. The company traded at about 14 times its past 12 months of earnings as of Thursday's close, compared with almost 20 for the  S&amp;P  500, looking like a relative bargain at a time when many investors are concerned about stretched valuations.
 RBC Capital Markets  analysts led by  Amit Daryanani  adjusted their target price for the company upward to  $120  from  $117  a share Thursday, maintaining a rating of ""outperform."" They said that the current price still offers a good entry point for investors and that  Apple  has been a relative oasis in recent market volatility.
 RBC  analysts said worries remain that innovation is declining at  Apple , with new sales driven more by existing owners replacing phones than new customers buying in. But it has attractive valuations, gross margins that are at least stable, and a consumer friendly ecosystem of hardware and software integrated across multiple devices that would be difficult for competitors to replicate, they said.",0

But how do I have enough cash on hand to keep paying down my mortgage? If I keep some of it liquid, but it's rotting away in a savings account at 1%, would it just have been better to have that piled into the mortgage instead of sitting in savings waiting for a monthly payment?

I plan on contributing the 5500 each year for as long as I can (not sure if I can backdoor it in 7 years or not, will have to look into it.) I plan on investing the 5500 each year into a different stock that pays a decent dividend. I know this sub is big on ETFs but I've never dealt with them and I have always just bought a company.

2015 Bought 104 shares of EAT

2016 Was a bit short on cash (still a student) so I have not invested yet, but I am thinking of putting it in Ford or KOF. I was considering (O) but I personally do not like how REITS are always diluting their shares. Again, personal preference. Otherwise I'd love to get that sweet dividend.

2017 Perhaps a tech stock. Maybe I'll be boring and just stick it in AAPL, although I will probably look for another tech. MSFT? We'll see

Plan on holding these stocks for the next 25+ years so I don't really care what they do in the meantime. Also, I will be FRIPing all my dividends into another stock that I haven't bought. I just think it'd be nice to slowly build up a new holding purely on dividends.

16-09-17,537gm7,Thinking about the next black swan event. When will it happen? How will it happen?,"Back in 2007/2008, there were a shit ton of warning signs that the economy was going to crash. I was in high school then. In the summer of 2007, news was leaking out that the subprime mortgage market has collapsed. 

At the time, most adults I talked to were like, ""Oh, well that means that a lot of homes are going to into foreclosure, and that the banks will have to eat this huge loss."" No one knew that this toxic, worthless debt was shifted between many different financial institutions through derivative contracts and securitization, causing the institutions that extend credit to the economy to potentially shrivel up when their obligations came due, in the great wealth transfer between them and the people that bet against them.

Through 2007 and 2008, I kept a cursory eye on economic news. Eventually, Lehman Brothers collapsed and rest was history..

Now... I've been reading about past economic failures in the United States, and it's clear that many economic downturns occur because excessive credit is generated, debts are not paid back, people become afraid to lend, and because new credit is not being generated, many kinds of economic activity grind to a halt, which ultimately causes a reduction in aggregate demand, and ultimately, deflation, job losses, etc.

Alternatively, other downturns have occurred because excessive overproduction of goods and services leads to reduced demand, and this reduced demand and excess supply drives down prices and wages for everyone, causing everyone to tighten their belts. 

Now... given knowledge of these patterns, when is the next ""great tightening"" going to occur? Given the shenanigans that central banks and the Federal Reserve have played, it's likely that in case of any possible credit crunch that might peak its head up, they will go all in with NIRP, bond buying, etc. 

**Not that I fault the central banks for their shenanigans.** Failure of effective government policy to bring about good fiscal stimulus makes it so that the only stimulus that can be offered is monetary stimulus, and monetary stimulus doesn't really do much except line the pockets of people who are in the financial markets. Ordinary people like you and me might get lucky when stock prices rise, but that's only for people who are in the market. Most people do not own stocks or bonds.

Between the excessive cash awash in our financial system and weak aggregate demand (for example, many companies in the S&amp;P 500 have reported decreases in earnings this past quarter), I believe that the next bout of economic instability may come from a combination of reduced aggregate demand in the future and asset prices finally popping because everyone wants to sell when the going is good. 

Debt is everywhere. Student loan debt crimps the ability of people to buy more things. Meanwhile, companies have pumped themselves full of debt to buy back their shares because of low interest rates. Eventually it will become unsustainable, leading to reduced capital investment and reduced aggregate demand. 

**It's going to be a slow burn. There might be some drama when people finally sell their shares/bonds/real estate or when the Fed tries to raise interest rates. Black swan event may occur here, but it's not going to be predictable due to market psychology.**

**It's going to be like Japan during the 1990s.**

Now, I might be totally wrong on this. Furthermore, since I'm a bit of a noob, I wouldn't know how to trade this or even figure out what to bet against. I would bet against companies with excessive debt on their books and negative revenue growth, but it's probably all priced in already. **Betting against corporate bonds would also be a good bet, since that has ballooned over the years.**

In a final note, I'm not an economist. I'm just a layman who's read a few books and articles here and there. I've taken a few economics courses at the university, but that's it. More knowledgeable people should share their thoughts as well.

**TLDR: We are going to get ourselves into a rut like Japan did during the 1990s, due to low interest rates, increased debt, and reduced aggregate demand. It's already happening. Bet against companies with excessive debt and negative revenue growth.**",39

16-09-17,539mfa,Actual due diligence on Mylan,"Ran a fairly detailed operating model on Mylan, a pharmaceutical company with one specialty (EpiPen) and a slew of generics drugs across different classes. They are first and foremost a generics play with a specialty business that's getting a lot of shit right now for a price hike. The company is managed fairly well, except for the part where they decided to raise EpiPen prices during an election. 

Reasonably levered, with roughly 37% debt / total cap, and 2.9x net debt / EBITDA. Total debt / EBITDA is pretty high, at 5.6x though so the company will likely not make any more acquisitions in the immediate short-term until it pays off at least the senior notes due in 2018, and the term loans due in 2017. The company is still swallowing the acquisition of Meda which was in early 2016. Solid cash flow profile, with something in the neighborhood of 24.5% EBITDA margin (First half of 2016 was a bit lower than it had historically been). Recently ROIC has been around 5% - 6%. 

In terms of projections, I figured that the generics business would gradually decline at a rate of something like -4.0% a year after a few years, and that the EpiPen (allergy) revenue would decline by a considerably larger amount after competitors come onto the market, which could happen as early as this year. This was the 'downside' case, with upside and base cases much more rosy in terms of the speed of the decline. 

I assumed that Mylan would keep a cash base of $3.0bn for acquisitions and use the rest of the cash it generates to pay down its debt. This resulted in roughly 3.0x total debt / EBITDA within 5 years, which would be a profile similar to that of the company before it acquired Meda. The company has a lot of debt but it's reasonably able to pay it all off without drawing on its revolver or refinancing.

Ultimately valued the company on a DCF basis, using terminal multiple method and a projection period of 5 years. Used a relatively conservative discount rate of 9.0% and terminal EBITDA multiple of 11.0x (what Mylan was at near the start of this year, this multiple is much higher now due to increased EV from debt / acquisition). Downside gives $45.59 / share (9.1% premium), base gives $53.50 / share (28.0% premium), and upside gives $61.65 / share (47.5% premium).

Overall, Mylan was probably not anywhere near a buy at the start of this year, and would have been tough to suggest at the roughly $50 / share it traded at before this price hike clown fiesta started. But now it's worth looking at.

16-09-17,537ux4,Alternative Uptick Rule Explanation?,"Hi everyone.  Recently I've been long in a stock for the past few months that yesterday (evidently) had a massive bear raid / short interest during a news day, driving the stock down 10.93%.  My understanding is that, given it closed at over 10% loss, the stock in question is now on a Restricted Short Sale list due to the Alternative Uptick Rule taking effect.

My question is does this prevent **all** short-selling for the day on this stock come Monday, or does it just mean that individuals cannot engage in shorting the stock unless it is on an individual up ""tick"" during the day?

Furthermore, which of the below scenarios would classify as an uptick?

A) Stock opens at $1, stock dips to $.98, then rallies back to $.99. Is that $.98 to $.99 considered an uptick?

B) Or, in simple terms, would the stock have to go above $1 at some point throughout the day to be considered on an uptick for the day itself?  IE: $1.01 or higher?

Thanks guys.  Just trying to learn how Restricted Short Selling affects a stock when it kicks into effect so I can best plan on if I could be seeing a rally my way come Monday, or if it really isn't going to have much effect at all.  Appreciate your time.",4

Also, I'm assuming that municipal bonds (tax-exempt, fixed-rate, AAA-rated), short of the municipality going bankrupt, are basically bullet-proof, right? Hell or high water, you get your fixed-rate yield. Recessions or no, you get your money back at maturity.

16-09-19,53h7h0,Serious question regarding Market Orders,"So I might sound really dumb, but my understanding of market order is that regardless of size of the order, the chronological order is what determines who gets in at the best price.

So my question is for something volatile like NUGT. If I place a market order after hours everyday right after the market closes - with the plan to cancel that market order unless a huge catalyst event occurs (ex BOJ decides to ramp up monetary policy) right before the start of the next day. Will that give me the best  price discount on the overnight gap up (or down).

If so, does anyone actually use this - it seems like it has the potential to be a good strategy. Thanks",3

16-09-19,53hb2f,Should the Fed raise rates?,"I've been debating with several people about the speculative rate hike coming up in September. My opinion, as of the latest economic data coming from China and other countries such as Japan, the Fed should postpone the decision till the beginning of 2017. My arguments are simple and straight forward. Increasing the rate right now will increase the value of the dollar. that will hurt at first our exports which is already in a deficit.(I am aware that if will never be a net or surplus) The recent devaluation of the Yuan is creating a dilemma among the american producers. The devaluation purely means cheaper labor and cheaper product. In today's age the average American is seeking for the most at of his buck, therefore retail companies such as Ross, Tj Max and Marshalls have been showing steady growth so far in areas where Macys has been struggling. To my point, this will lead to a shift of production to China as an example.(I am aware that most of it is already outside the US) Unemployment can take a hit as prices of goods coming from China will drop. Producers in the US will not be able to compete with the low prices, forcing them to lay off their employees. This topic also touches the GDP. Lower prices means lower GDP. The only place where increase in rates can actually be beneficial in the real estate market. Prices might start going down, the foreign investment will drop and making it harder for Chinese investors to invest their cash here.",3

16-09-19,53hl5z,The SolarCity (SCTY) - Tesla (TSLA) merger might not actually go through...,"That's according to Wall Street itself, which is pricing SCTY stock at a huge discount to its takeout price. Under the terms of the buyout agreement, SCTY shareholders will receive 0.11 shares of TSLA for each SolarCity share they own. 

The math on that:
TSLA price (9/16 close): $205.40
Implied SCTY takeout price: $22.59 ($205.40 * 0.11)

SCTY price (9/16 close): $17.50.

So, SCTY is trading 23 percent below its takeout price, implying significant uncertainty. There are a few reasons for this, I leave it to you to decide how valid they are, but I just thought this was really interesting and a sort of under-covered topic. 

If you think the deal's gonna close in Q4, now might be a ripe time to load up on SolarCity. On the other hand, it's still dependent on Tesla's stock price, so you need to be somewhat confident that Tesla will remain stable for the next few months. 

Thoughts?

Low debt, growing revenue, profits, decent interest coverage, and etc. They've burned through a lot of cash these past few quarters... Still opening new shipping facilities across the country.

16-09-19,53f767,NVDA DD feel free to critique,"Nvidia’s foundational revenue stream is in its gaming-oriented PC GPU products.  Despite diversification into other market segments, this product division remains the largest revenue-generator for Nvidia. Over the last six quarters, gaming-related products have accounted for more than 50% of sales revenue for the company. However, this relative share of revenue has declined as Nvidia has expanded into other product areas. Since their Q1 2016 report (4-26-2015), revenue streams from Datacenter and Automotive products have increased by 71.6% and 54.55% respectively. Nvidia also generates a significant portion of its revenues from Professional Visualization and OEM &amp; IP products as well. Combined, these segments represent roughly 25% of Nvidia’s revenue. It is worth noting that over the last six quarters the revenue generated from OEM &amp; IP products has declined 25.22% while the revenue from Professional Visualization products has increased by 18.2%


Regionally, Nvidia still derives most of its revenue from the Asia Pacific markets. In Q2 2017 (7-31-2016), revenue in the Asia Pacific region accounted for 66.67% of overall revenue. This is compared to 14.42% from the US, 11.69% from Europe, and 7.21% from Other Americas. There has been stable revenue growth from every region over the last six quarters, keeping in line with the growth in overall revenue. The largest regional growth can be seen in the Asia Pacific and United States regions, indicating improving consumer demand in both of these areas.


Having recognized the declines in relative revenue generation from video game segments, Nvidia has shifted their focus moving forward to larger-scale, more innovative market segments. At Nvidia’s GTC China 2017 presentation, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang highlighted the massive impact that deep learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) will have on the world in the coming years. Nvidia seeks to push the boundaries of AI and deep learning technologies, and their first step is with their new GPU architecture, Pascal. Nvidia’s latest line of GPUs for both consumer and commercial use have been hailed as the best performing processors on the market. Furthermore, during the Q2 2017 earnings call, Huang reiterated his belief that deep learning is going to be the company’s most significant growth driver moving forward. Nvidia has very recently procured a contract with Chinese web company Baidu to develop AI platforms for their self-driving cars, adding their name to a client list which already includes industry leaders such as Tesla and BMW. A recent Bank of America forecast suggested that the deep learning and AI market could reach $153 billion by 2020, and Nvidia already has a strong position in the industry. 
	

Nvidia has very strong fundamentals currently. Over the last seven years, Nvidia has reported positive revenue and net income. Both of these metrics have seen substantial growth as costs have been reduced and profit margins have improved. Since 2010 both the total assets and total capital available have nearly doubled to $7370 million and $4580 million respectively. Nvidia has also seen substantial improvements in its ROA, ROC, and ROE. As of FY2016 reporting, ROA is 10.59%, ROC is 17.04%, and ROE is 17.46%. It is estimated that in FY2017, Nvidia will see revenue of $6098 million (12.12% increase from FY2016), net income of $1381.4 million (41.8% increase), and an EPS of $2.30 (67.9% increase). 
	

Nvidia’s TTM P/E ratio is currently sitting at 38.28 compared to an industry average of 15.2 and has a P/BV ratio of 7.51 compared to an industry average of 2.7. Normally these may indicate that the stock is overvalued, however Nvidia is seemingly at the forefront of a huge growth phase in an emerging industry and it appears that the market has priced this future growth in. In the coming months we should see a reduction in the P/E ratio due to higher EPS levels. As of their latest reporting, Nvidia has a current ratio of 2.56. This shows a lot fundamental strength for Nvidia to meet and short-term liabilities. Nvidia’s FY2016 profit margin was 15.58%, and impressive number alongside an equally impressive ROE of 17.46%. 
	

Given current fundamentals, Nvidia will be able to see a growth rate of 11.1%. This number is based on an equally-weighted average between the company’s Long-Run Growth Rate (10.90%) as shown on the company’s Bloomberg Terminal page and the Sustainable Growth Rate (11.28%) derived from the following formula: (ROE*b)/[1-(ROE*b)] where ROE is the company’s return on equity for the previous fiscal year and b is the retention ratio for the company. Nvidia’s current WACC is 12.5%, which is used as a benchmark for required return. Based on these two values and Nvidia’s returns over the last six years, Nvidia has an implied value of $46,827.67 million when using an earnings power valuation model. With 535 million shares outstanding, this implies a stock price of $87.52 per share. At the closing price of $62.84 on Sept. 16, there is a margin of safety of 28%. 
	

In spite of the huge returns Nvidia has already seen this year, I believe that it still has huge upside potential and would be a fantastic long-term buy. Nvidia’s upcoming product lines and revenue streams have positioned them positioned the company to be at the forefront of a growing deep learning and AI industry. Automation and self-learning software are becoming a larger part of our lives every day and Nvidia is creating the tools necessary to meet these new computational demands.",103

However, I do believe the market is acting as Hillary will definitely be the nominee as sectors react to what she says and not so much to Trump.

However if Trump actually does win I do believe there will be a pullback that will continue to pull back over a longer period of time.  With so much uncertainty on how he will deal with trade/economic/foreign relation, I am for the first time seriously thinking about exiting the market.  This is a much different kind of election and many economists are frightened to the repercussions of a Trump presidency. 

I don't want to pull out of the market, but I might preemptively do so at the mere chance that Trump could pull it off.  My question is, am I overthinking this, meaning I know there's always a pullback in election cycles but this one could be way more exaggerated based off the level of Trump's incompetence by what he says publicly.  Is there anyone else out there that feels this way?  If you can talk me down from doing so I would love to hear people's thoughts on the matter..

16-09-19,53ii1a,Going cash until US elections are over,"Anyone else with me on this one?
 
I do firmly believe that the FED will raise rates eventually. Whether they do it now, 1 week before elections (lol good luck with that) or 1 month after elections - we saw the outcome of the last 0,25% raise. I predict a similar outcome for this one - high volatility, shortlived selloff with a rally afterwards (simply because there are currently no alternatives to stocks). 

Add to that the US elections with Trump actually being a real possibility now - I don't even know how markets are going to react.

All this uncertainty with little visible upside (the current bull market post-Brexit is on very shaky legs - low volume, low volatility). It seems like the big boys are sitting this one out too with hedge funds cash ratio at record highs. 

For me, sitting this one out is the better option - I just don't feel very confident in the market right now with too many uncertainties ahead. 
I would actually buy Nov/Dec puts on SPY if I had the balls.

How are you currently positioned? What is your rationale behind it?

What do you think the FED will do? Raise tomorrow? in November? QE4? 

Who will be POTUS and how will it affect the markets?

I bought several Acres of land about 10 years ago in Vietnam.  I think it's like 40 Acres

About 5 years ago,  I found out that Vietnam was moving their international airport from ho chi minh city close to where my land is at. 

They're already in the first phase of building the airport and mentioned that it'll be up and running by 2019.

Now the value of my property has probably shot up incredibly.  I have no idea by how much,  but I bought it for very cheap.  


What should I do with this land? I want to invest like hotels, housing,  gas stations,  etc.  or hold on to it and sell. My other idea is to sell all the Acres and use that money to buy a large +15 unit apartment complex.  I have experience with that more than I do with overseas investments.

16-09-19,53izkk,[UK] Help to Buy ISA or invest in stocks? Options for a newbie.,"Hey guys,

I have been reading up on stocks and share, investing, market patterns, candlesticks, the rest... and i am ready to really start thinking of making my savings grow by playing the market.


A bit about me, I finished my degree a year ago and landing a good job with a great competitive salary straight out of University. i have been saving ever since and paying off small debts. I want to save enough for a house deposit on a mortgage but live and work just outside the M25. Naturally, i jumped at the chance to save into the Help to Buy ISA.

The HTB ISA started in April this year(2016) and can give you a free reward of 25% on what you have saved if you are a first time buyer. Now currently i have saved to max the ISA allows to date, ie ~£2,400. Therefore if i bought a house tomorrow i would actually have £3,000 to bring to the table. Hope you are still with me.

**My question is**: is it possible to gain &gt;25% growth of my current tiny deposit within 6 months, if i invest it instead in stocks/forex/ and/or so on?

~£3000 is no where near enough £££ for a house in and around where i currently live and work, and so I'm seeing no benefit of this ISA unless i stick with is for &gt;3years of saving £200s every month, then the 25% is actually substantial. I hope to have more than one property within those years and wont be a first time buyers.

Apologies for the wall of text, hope it makes sense and thanks for any comments.",1

16-09-20,53lr83,Canadian YOLO: Golden Syrup Marijuana Holdings Company in Oregon and Washington. GLH:CSE DD,"This company trades on the CSE, and will trade on the OTCQB in 2 weeks (according to the CEO on Thursday evening during a Cannabis investor webcast). The stock closed at 0.29 on thursday before the announcement, and today it closed at 0.45.

**GLH Story:**

* the CEO Don Robinson is former CEO of famous restaurant operator known as Cara food. (TSX: CAO).
* Company is focused soley on the edibles and oil markets at the current moment, the Washington marijuana operation known as BMF is focused on large grow operations. The washington portion of the business is however an intangible asset on the company's Balance Sheet due to the current regulations regarding money flow between state lines with marijuana companies.
* The Yearly Trailing Revenues of the company in USD is between 19-21 Million or so. That in CAD equates to about 27 mill on the high spectrum. The company closed at a market cap of 50 Million or so. 
* A lot of the management team has purchased debentures at high strike prices to help fund the business.
* Unlike CGC, APH, OGI, SL, and MT. This company already has market share in a legal market and sells its products to about 250 or so dispensaries in Oregon, and in Washington a large amount as well. And also, this company is only trading at 2x its price to sales. While CGC trades at 25x its sales, APH trades at 33x its sales 790x its earnings (it is making earnings however, so credit where credit is due), OGI trades at 28x Its earnings, SL hasn't even made a sale yet and is valued at a whopping 106 Million. The point is **there is a massive disconnect on this company's speculative value in the current Green Rush of CAD stocks**

[Research Report on Company for Longer DD](http://goldenleafholdings.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Viridian-Capital-Advisors-Golden-Leaf-Holdings-Research-Report.pdf) 

**Risks:**

* Why such a disconnect you may ask? 
* The US regulatory environment is far less predictable with the schedule 1 status of Marijuana and its products. 
* Oregon is a shit show with their marijuana testing procedures.
* Company in the past year has been sold off as regulatory concerns in Oregon lead to a few massive scares by investors. (Company was not able to produce oil for a certain period, A fake pesticide scare in Washington, and just the annoyances of being an all cash business and their current ability to generate cash flow)

* Is this a risky play?  **Yes, it's definitely not as safe of a bet from a fundamentals perspective in comparison to its Canadian-competitors. However, if you believe in the growth of these two states, this is a good opportunity. ** 
* Is their still upside left? [Your god dam right there is](https://media0.giphy.com/media/j2PS9MGm85WkE/200_s.gif) 

**Upcoming Catalysts**

* US General Election, California, Nevada and other major states are up for legalization. 
* If Hilary Clinton wins and actually follows through with making marijuana schedule two if elected.

16-09-20,53lyqz,Strategy for 5% net return on borrowed cash (HELOC) - Canadian,"I want to share this strategy for earning &gt;5% return on borrowed money.  Reference links for all numbers used in calculations are at the bottom of the post.
  
Obviously this is not suitable for everyone, but there is a broad range of people for which this will be applicable.  In the description and spreadsheet below I am making the following assumptions:
  
  
ASSUMPTIONS  
- You qualify for a low interest line of credit (HELOC for example)
- You are earning somewhere around $100,000, resulting in marginal tax rate of 44%
- You have room in your TFSA, and a TFSA account capable of holding an ETF
- You have room to contribute to your RRSP
  
  
DESCRIPTION  
The cash from the line of credit is invested in a high dividend ETF inside of a TFSA.  In the example below I have done this with $10,000.  I have chosen a Canadian banks ETF, as I feel this is a very stable investment, I am not interested in growth just yield.  The interest paid is the only expense for this scenario.  The interest paid on the line of credit is tax deductible, this is our first ""income"" source.  The dividend is our second income source.  Finally, the dividend is paid monthly and reinvested in an RRSP, resulting in a second tax break, providing our third income source.
  
  
RISKS  
- Credit risk, depending on personal situation
- Equity risk, underlying value of Canadian banks stock could drop
  
  
BENEFITS  
- Process can be automated
- Essentially zero cash required
- Low risk liquid investment that leverages value of home
- Potential for growth, increasing effective return
  
  
NUMBERS  
Line of Credit Value	$10,000  
LOC interest rate	3.50%  	
Yearly LOC cost	-$350  
Tax return on LOC cost (44% Marginal Tax)	$154  
TFSA return on dividend ETF (ZWB ETF, 5.3%)	$530  
Tax return from RRSP invested dividend	$233  
NET	$567  
NET Return	5.67%

16-09-19,53jba9,(update) Did some regression stock price analysis on Forbes most innovative companies over a 2 year span...wow!,"I had a theory I posted the other day that Forbes most innovative companies could outperform the S&amp;P 500 over a 2 year period. 

Forbes doesn't look merely at R&amp;D spending but by companies ""innovation premium"": the difference between their market capitalization and the net present value of cash flows from existing businesses (based on a proprietary algorithm from Credit Suisse HOLT). The difference between them is the bonus given by equity investors on the educated hunch that the company will continue to come up with profitable new growth.

For this test, I simply took the 5 most innovative companies on the Forbes annual list in 2012 and looked at their 24 month performance vs the S&amp;P 500. 

The results were eye popping: 

1. The top 5 stocks: ALXN, CRM, BIDU, AMZN, RHAT returned 51.25% return in 2 years compared to the S&amp;P 500 39.34%

2. $1 million invested equally across the stocks would have returned $1,512,250 compared to $1,393,400 for the S&amp;P 500. 

I will run more analysis on other years, haven't yet because I have a day job, but if there's interest out there, I will and let you guys know. 

To me, innovation, especially in tech, is one of the most important factors in a companies success. The ones that are willing to create a culture of innovation have the potential to be more successful than those that don't.

I have seen much interest lately on reddit regarding the use of technical analysis to make stock choices. Seeing as how I have been trading using primarily technical analysis for the last few years, with success, I figured now would be a good time to begin sharing some of my short-term trade ideas.

Once a week (or more frequently), I scan through hundreds of stock charts looking for great potential plays using technical analysis.

16-09-20,53mt9x,Thoughts on Spin-offs in general and the up coming AdvanSix spin off from Honeywell,"Prefix: I'm currently reading ""you can be a stock market genius"" by Joel Greenblatt.  Before you judge the title, It actually a pretty reasonable book. Its fairly highly recommended in the side bar post, and reviews tend to stay ignore the dumb title.  One of the points he makes is that spin offs in general out perform the market.  The reasoning is institutional inventors like to buy large companies usually in the SP 500 or 1000.  So when a spin off happens there is huge sell off.  ""Indiscriminate selling"" is a big thing in the book.  Its what you want to seek out and find because it means you can get stocks for bargain prices.  He claims spin offs on average over time, out perform the SP 500 for 10%.  So SP historically returns around 10%, spin offs return around 20% (of course results on individual spin offs or over short time periods results may vary)

So in 12 days on Oct 2nd.  AdvanSix will spin off from Honeywell

* AdvanSix is a leading producer of Nylon-6, Caprolactam, and some other chemicals that are either needed for Nylon-6 or byproducts of the production process.
* Increased production from China is a big challenge for them.
* SP hasn't yet announced if they will be included in the Sp 500 index.
* Sales have declined in the last 18 months, but they admit it is a cyclical business.
* PE ratio for [chemical manufacturing](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/pedata.html) is between 25 and 28 currently.
* 2015 earnings look to be just 68 million (from a billion in sales). 
* there will be about 31 million Shares (780 honeywell shares divided by 25).  So with a PE of 25, I'd expect a share price of $54.
* [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1673985/000093041316007091/c84951_ex99-1.htm) is their form 10.  Obviously double check my numbers before you make any decision with your own money.

I'm interested in watching the share price after the spin off.  It is trades at a competitive PE, I think i'll be going in with maybe 10% or so of my money.

One thing I see on the form 10, is that is looks like only about 15% of the CEO's compensation will be in the form of stocks, and will initially own no shares.  Greenblatt is big on watching what insiders are doing, and would probably like to she the CEO try to grab a bigger share of the company.  That combined with the fact that this is my first spinoff i'm watching might lead me to just watch on this one.

16-09-20,53pxjd,leveraged value-orientated track record for opening a hedge fund in the distant future?,"Dear fellow redditors,
first of all, I highly appreciate you taking your time and making an effort to contribute something to my question, as I highly value your opinions.Additionally, I want to apologize for writing so much, but I want to make completely sure that my position is understandably represented. First of, I am sure a caveat to this provocative title is appropriate to calm your probably existing and very understandable anger or doubts: I am definately NOT thinking about opening an hedge fund in the near future and I take the responsibility regarding such endeavours very seriously. Dealing with other peoples hard earned money is extremely dangerous, requires (or should require at least) high ethical standards and should only be done if the capability of the person doing it can be assured to a satisfyingly high degree. My great role models regarding moral behavour and competence in the field are Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger, Prem Watsa, Seth Klarman, Walter Schloss etc. Because of all this, I am working as hard as I possibly can to gain all the knowledge and experience possible and establish a long term track record to finally prove my investment philosophy under real world conditions with high enough probability of continued success in the future. 
Therefore, I am thinking about 5 years of a verified, real money account track record. It is evident that the longer the period is, the better, but in terms of this I think you have to find a reasonable 	compromise between a long enough track record before starting the fund and an acceptable waiting period to finally start it.
My questions are:
1) Are 5 years sufficient as a track record ? In the end, I am sure to continue to invest either way, so if that was not enough I would simply wait a few more years.
2) Regarding the track record itself: is it sufficient to just invest with my private, real money Interactive Brokers account or do I have to make any arrangements to increase the record´s credibility ?
3) My approach is value-orientated, long-only, high on business analysis, long-term and bottom-up. My orientation is the mentioned investor group above. But as I am relatively young and having little money, I am currently using very long term  In the money options ( LEAPS ) to get some leverage.
Regarding results, it works perfectly fine and I diversify adequately, buy as I mentioned just conservative ITM calls and try my best to minimize losses.
To clarify, I dont really doubt making the neccessary, risk-adjusted profits, but I am not sure whether a leveraged track record is convincing for potential investors. So, if I invest for 5 years with LEAPS and do just fine, is this a potential problem and will the leverage devaluate or nullify my track record ? I am concerned that all the years might be totally wasted and people might not accept my record. On the other hand, I want and need some conservative leverage as I do not have a lot of personal money yet and the benefit is enormous for my personal portfolio. If there is absolutey no way around an unleveraged track record to be ""bulletproof"", I might need to open an additional, small account and invest in this simultaneously to my real bigger account. The problem is just that then my smaller account might just contain very little money at the beginning (1000$, at most 2000$) since I want to continue with the vast majority in my major account.

It pays a 7.1% dividend, and mails the checks to investors each quarter. 

Also, I found out they own more than 7% of the Nasdaq (NDAQ) but it's not on their balance sheet because NDAQ is paying them the shares over time...but the share payments are guaranteed unless Nasdaq generates less than $25 million of revenue; but Nasdaq generates $3,500 million revenue so I don't think it's a problem.

# Description

Wynn Resorts, Limited is a developer, owner and operator of destination casino resorts that integrate accommodations and a range of amenities, including dining outlets, retail offerings, entertainment theaters and meeting complexes. There are 450+ tables and 
700+ slot machines in Macau with another 200+ tables and 1,850 slots in Vegas. Plus there's the new outfit coming in Everett, MA!

## Recent financials 

The figures say it all :(

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $4.1bn | $5.4bn | $5.6bn | $5.2bn | $5.3bn|
|EPS | $1.92 | $7.18 | $7.17 | $4.82 | $4.88|

But if you want to know why? Macau saw sales down 35% in 2015 (to $2.5bn) and Vegas was off a little (down 2% to $1.6bn). 

&gt; The decline is primarily due to the continued weak gaming environment affecting our Macau Operations, which experienced a year-over-year decrease in casino revenues of 35.5% from $3,586.8 million to $2,312.9 million. Our VIP gaming operations drove the Macau Operations casino revenue reduction, with $57.92 billion in VIP turnover for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $108.08 billion for the same period of 2014.

Is that the canary in the coal mine for China? Or just that the wealthy are embracing the new president's austere views? 

## Competition

Let's focus on Macau first

&gt; In addition to Wynn Macau SA, each of Sociedade de Jogos de Macau (""SJM"") and Galaxy Entertainment Group Limited are primary concessionaires with Sands China Ltd., Melco Crown and MGM China Holdings Limited operating under subconcessions. There is no limit to the number of casinos each concessionaire or subconcessionaire is permitted to operate, but each facility is subject to government approval. Currently, there are 36 operating casinos in Macau.

Oh dear. Sounds like there's overcapacity...

&gt; As of December 31, 2015, there were 32,200 hotel rooms, 5,957 table games and 14,578 slot machines in Macau, compared to 12,978 hotel rooms, 2,762 table games and 6,546 slot machines as of December 31, 2006.

So a 2 to 3 fold increase in 10 years. 

Now over in Vegas things are decidedly rosier!

&gt; During 2015, the average daily room rate increased 2.7% and visitation increased 2.9% to 42.3 million visitors compared to 2014. In addition, Las Vegas Strip resorts experienced 2015 year-over-year increases of 0.6% and 3.3% in occupancy and revenue per available room, respectively.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Wynn Resorts, Limited | $3,999M | 24% | N/A
Las Vegas Sands Corp. | $11,122M | 32% | 24%
MGM Resorts International | $8,952M | 22% | -3%
Red Rock Resorts Inc | $1,382M | 34% | 33%
Penn National Gaming, Inc | $2,999M | 29% | N/A
Churchill Downs, Inc. | $1,279M | 21% | 12%

So margins are good, but not great... and returns are N/A... why? Because WYNN's been so good at returning capital that there really is no equity left to measure returns on equity. Nice!

## Cash / Debt?

Wynn Resorts, Limited has $7,345M of net debt. That is 7.8x its latest operating profit. Ooops. So in effect the aggressive pay-outs come with a catch. 

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|EPS | $1.92 | $7.18 | $7.17 | $4.82 | $4.88|
|Cash distribution per share | $3.00 | $6.26 | $7.00 | $9.50 | $6.50|

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $102.54 for Wynn Resorts, Limited and their recommendation to clients is _Hold_. That implies an downside of 6% to their target.

# Valuation

At 28x earnings it's hard to disagree with the brokers. Though, am a little surprised they see such good long-term growth prospects. How can I justify WYNN when RRR is on 18x and PENN on 13x?

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/wynn.o/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
WYNN.O | $11,051M | 28x | 23% | 2% | 8%
LVS | $46,342M | 27x | N/A | 5% | 11%
MGM | $14,389M | 35x | 10% | 1% | 0%
RRR.O | $2,490M | 18x | 3% | 1% | 18%
PENN.O | $1,113M | 13x | 5% | 0% | 6%
CHDN.O | $2,488M | 25x | 12% | 1% | 8%

# Dividends

Wynn Resorts, Limited is forecast to pay a dividend of $2.16 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $2.00 per share. That is a 8% growth. The forecast dividend of $2.16 compares to a forecast EPS of $3.88.

# Catalysts

After the horror of 2015, 2016's got back on track and the business is stabilising and EPS is recovering. In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 8% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of +6%. Though on a 1 year view the stock's up 60% with earnings up 20%.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers they highlighted that Macau's improving and that they'll keep up returning capital to shareholder. They even spoke of the new casino near Boston, finally getting it's construction permits. But the one thing they didn't do was talk guidance. Seems it's just not something they do!

I fear the easy money's been made on WYNN the last 12 months, as folks that believe the earnings would come back got rewarded. So, how do the chips fall from here? Is the next big event, the launch of Boston? Or will we have to bear the capex cost before we see the benefit?

What's your gamble?

-----------

&gt; Class. Action. Lawsuit.

Honestly, that's the most pathetic thing to do. You were the one who gambled, and lost. Go Fuck Yourself if you think Mast owes you anything, they don't. They are just doing their own thing there, and this one didn't go through. And people who ~~invested~~ gambled on them are now going to try and sue them for... What exactly?

They didn't defraud, release false information, or act against the shareholders.

PS: If you're thinking about doing it, no one will stop you, but you're a massive douchebag who can't handle the stock market, just stop. Look at $GT's Class Action, all you will do is spend more of your money, not get your money back, and hurt the company even more.

I want to use Bollinger Bands to determine the range in which the Value of GOOGL will be on the 15th but I am not quite sure how to use Bollinger Bands to do this. 

One More question I calculated a standard deviation of 7.359 for the ten day period. Does this mean on the tenth day that the Stock Value should theoretically only change by a value of 7.359

16-09-20,53nkmq,Share your checklist,"I thought it would be nice for each one of us to share his checklist for what one considers a company worth of investing in. It could give an individual some ideas and perspective at evaluating a stock.

I'll start with mine, although I should add that I only started participating in investing now. I've been reading books, articles and forums for the past 6 months prior though. Here is the checklist that I gathered from the various information that I read:

    F-score (value investing. I like mine to be 7-9) - 
    p/e relative to industry/competitors - 
    Profit margin relative to industry/competitors - 
    Is the company rewarding shareholders (dividends/share buyback)? - 
    Debt status (is the amount of debt decreasing? Can the company go bankrupt?) - 
    Is there an increase in earnings? - 
    General up trend  - 
    Is the company making acquisitions? (I like companies that use the excess cash in a form of dividends and share buybacks) - 
    Institutions position relative to previous quarter (has it increased or decreased)- 
    Institutions position (I like companies that have a rather small institutions position, below 80%)- 
    Insider position (&gt;5% is great in my opinion)- 
    Understandable business - 
    Competitive position - 
    Future plans - 
    Test the product - 
    Will the product keep sales in a depression? - 
    Does it have a niche or a patent? - 
    Is the company relaying on a single customer or contract?  - 
    How is the company planning to earn more? - 
    Is expending a possibility? - 
    Is the product a one time purchase? - 

Again, I do not advise anyone to follow this checklist since I have no investing record, I posted it so some of could get ideas off this checklist, and to get some ideas myself in order to improve mine.",1

It has a diverse portfolio of products in the areas of narcolepsy, oncology, pain and psychiatry. Its product portfolio includes: XYREM, ERWINAZETM, PRIALT, intrathecal infusion, FAZACLO and LUVOX CR. The company was founded by Bruce C. Cozadd on January 18, 2012 and is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland.**


*You might know this company from their acquisition of CPXX, or from the recent Shkrelli speech saying its worth double at $15-20 billion market cap instead of current $7 billion.*

*It has 16 buy 3 hold ratings, average price target is $180 and it has recently plummeted down to $118-119 a share, and we are not that far away from that price with a current share of $126. After seeing Lord Shkrelli being right about about the other part of the bet, my confidence has increased.*

*The P/E ratio is 22. %91 institutional ownership. Insiders have sold some of their shares lately, however they still have a significant amount and institutions have generally increased their positions, reiterated their ratings.*

*Short position has increased %13, with %3.5 percent float (interesting, would appreciate some insight on this, maybe a reaction to the industry sell off and insider sell offs ?)*


**Also, from Goldman Sachs analyst Stephen Stewart (from Barrons, article by Ben Levisohn June 6 2016):**

""
**After an M&amp;A-fueled super-cycle over the past three years, the sector has collapsed (-46% in the past year, S&amp;P flat) on a confluence of concerns around high leverage, pricing pressure across both brands and generic markets, and broader business model sustainability. While the collapse has presented a reset in sector valuations, ongoing pressures require stock selectivity with a focus on growth, quality, and emerging pipelines…**

**Forget what you know: Traditional multiples fail to capture potential risks. In the aftermath, we assess the efficacy of recent capital spend through the prism of financial returns. Our analysis reveals that much of the M&amp;A has destroyed value, and balance sheets are now bloated – making traditional multiples insufficient to capture the full story…To that end, we introduce a returns-based framework for analyzing the group, hinged on efficacy of recent capital spend, asset productivity, and organic growth…**

**We lean to relative quality and risk/reward, and avoid generics pending stabilization: Buy Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Horizon Pharma; Sell Impax Laboratories Our coverage reflects a mix of growth and brand/generic exposures. Jazz Pharmaceuticals and Horizon Pharma are purely branded companies, while others are all exposed to generics to varying degrees. We estimate highest organic growth for Jazz Pharmaceuticals and Horizon Pharma (~12% 2016E-2018E CAGR) versus ~6% median for others.**

**Jazz Pharmaceuticals (Buy): (1) niche spec pharma orphan portfolio with leading organic growth, margins, and returns; (2) 2016 catalysts – Xyrem litigation clarity, recent Defitelio launch, JZP-110 Phase 3 data; and (3) a management team with a solid business development track record and clean balance sheet ripe for strategic activity.**

I started thinking about it after the first driverless car accident a few months ago, the issues with how the law distributes liability, and just human nature ultimately being unable to let go. 

I'm going to try to complete a list of problem areas:

1. Liability and the Law.  (Are car manufactures willingly accepting liability for car accidents that result? Will the Driver accept the alternative that they can be held liable for a system malfunction?)

2. Hacking/Other security risks. Along with this is also privacy -- the NSA will know exactly where every person is at every time. 

3. System Failure/electronic malfunction

4. Traffic anomalies, such as the pittsburgh left turn. (I.e. when opposing traffic is stopped at a light, and the first car in the left lane wants to make a left turn, then the incoming traffic must stop for the front turning left car, but yet, it only applies if the first car is turning left) 

5. Decision making: When faced with an impossible choice, does the automated vehicle veer into traffic or veer to the otherside of the road? This touches on the liability issue previously mentioned. 

Edit* I get that it's common wisdom that driverless cars are the future. I was 100% on board with that idea until I stopped to think about it. Like everyone thought that mortgages were the safe bet in 2007. 

Edit 2* I also think that Tesla is a stand-up car company with or without driverless technology -- so I'm not keen on shorting them. Am I wrong? ",6

How much is the price of Crude Oil established by the purely factual economics of supply and demand and how much is it affected by trader sentiment and investor reaction?

[Futures pricing](http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) suggests a less than 20% chance of a 25 basis point increase, but, on the other hand, [two of the Fed's own primary dealers](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-19/two-of-fed-s-own-primary-dealers-warn-shock-hike-awaits-markets) (BNP and Barclays) are predicting there will be a hike.  The argument seems to be that if Yellen is serious about returning to a normal rate environment than a September hike would signal that seriousness and reinforce her credibility -- there's been no real exogenous shock this month to merit further delay and a delay might look like the Fed is responding to market pressure (rather than the other way around).  Just some food for thought -- [tomorrow](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-time-does-the-fed-interest-rate-decision-come-out-2016-09-20) should be interesting.",3

16-09-20,53knbe,What Bond investments would you recommend for an extended downturn to hedge losses?,"Greetings,

**Background** 26y/o and have been saving money/basic investing for the past two years. Currently working as an RN in northeastern US major city.

**Current assets/Investments** $2000 in Robinhood (all stocks), $2000 in 403b(Vanguard 2055 fund), $2500 in Roth IRA.


After reading the news on a regular basis, I believe that there will be an economic recession/downturn in the near future for a number of reasons. Assuming this and accounting for my current age and career, I am looking to start saving more cash while also shifting my investments into a more conservative holding through bonds. 



With this said, does anyone have any experience with bonds and be willing to add your thoughts and advice? I'm mainly looking to do this for my Robinhood account as it is currently 100% stocks.


Thanks in advance, Hopefully I was clear enough on what I'm looking for help with.



EDIT** Thanks to everyone for your input and guidance for this. I'll be focusing on saving some cash and researching/DD on bonds before making any decisions.",42

16-09-21,53qnc5,How much of an indicator can machine learning provide in detecting good versus bad market conditions?,"I generally buy and sell weekly as stock prices fluctuate with volatility. I am exploring the idea of using a machine learning algorithm to consider various economic conditions (inputs) and provide insight (output) into whether any given day is a safe day to buy, given market conditions, for a particular stock. Thus I'd like to determine the risk related to investing at any given time. I'm only trying create a model of current conditions; I'm not seeking to predict prices.

For example, it seems more likely that a market correction may occur (and it is bad to buy) when the S&amp;P 500 is pretty high, VIX is low, and the dollar is high.

Similarly, it seems less likely a market correction may occur (and it is good to buy) when indexes are not extremely high, the VIX is relatively higher, and the dollar is relatively lower.

Here is a compiled list of possible factors an algorithm could use as input:

* Fear/volatility index (VIX)
* GDP or GDP growth
* Current interest rate
* Current unemployment rate
* Current Federal funds interest rate
* Employee pay
* Housing market data
* Gold prices
* Dollar value
* Time of year (e.g. September is historically a bad month to invest)
* Oil price
* Bond prices
* Index growth
* Time until next Fed meeting
* Month price change %
* Day price change %

...and other factors (suggestions welcome).

For the purposes of getting exposure to the US equity market, it's not clear to me why this is ever better than just buying a total stock market ETF (e.g., VTI), for two reasons:

1. The expense ratio for the total stock market ETF seems to be usually lower than the other ETFs (e.g., 5bp for VTI, 8bp for Vanguard's small-cap or large-cap ETFs)

2. My assumption is that deviating from the total stock market ETF results in underdiversification.

The only reason I can imagine is that you disagree with the benchmark of your chosen total stock market ETF, and you want to correct for this. But I don't see how this is a good idea, most of the time?

So, should I just stick with VTI, or is there a good reason to look into other ETFs (for the purposes of passive investing)?",10

16-09-20,53osyh,What I learned after a month with ESSI,"One month ago I bought 140 shares of ESSI when it was at $0.75 because I read one article saying how undervalued it was and how much it could climb. The end of that day it was at $0.90. Skip ahead to last Friday when it jumped 50%, then yesterday 40%, then today up to $2.20. Unfortunately I never got to taste that $2.20.

Here's what I learned:

I should have researched more about the company/stock. Instead I invested money (granted not very much, and mostly what I had earned from dividends) into something I know nothing about.

I shouldn't have used a site that charges transaction fees because $10 for buying and $10 for selling takes a hell of a lot of the profit away from $100 investment.

I should set up notifications so that when a stock drops from $2.20 to $1.50 (or hopefully before then) I can know and get out.

I'm an idiot. (See above.) And because I'm an idiot I sold 40 then 100 shares, doubling the transaction fee. I shouldn't do that.

I should learn how to short, because this was an extremely rare opportunity and I couldn't take advantage of it.

Long story short I still doubled my $100 and ESSI is now plummeting back to being a penny stock. But at least I learned somthing. Thanks for reading.",3

Other than a pretty ""Fun"" concept, I think this will explode in popularity. 

Points to consider:

* The Trade Desk will offer 4.67 million shares at an expected price range of $16 to $18.

Sounds about right in my opinion.

* lead underwriters are Citigroup, Jefferies, and RBC Capital Markets.

\--

* TTD provides a real-time bidding platform, which enables advertising agencies to bid for and purchase multi-channel online ads.

Interesting concept, and brings returns, according to their revenue/net income increase.

* As described in its SEC Filings, The Trade Desk, Inc. enables ad buyers to purchase and manage data-driven digital advertising campaigns. The Trade Desk uses a self-serve platform and relies on its own teams in the United States, Europe, Asia, and Australia.

Nice concept, well-established.

* The company has plans to expand into Audio (now in a beta version).

Hm, Look at spotify and pandora. It's definitely somewhat-profitable.

* Revenue (2014, 2015): $44.5 Million, $114 Million. (Increase of ~160%)

Due to clients using their service more and more. (Started by testing, after results they jumped on the ship)

* Net Income (2014, 2015): $5,000, $16 Million (Increase of  320,000%)

That's a good increase, maybe it shows how efficient they are becoming?

* [Growth attributed to their current clients using their platform more, year after year.](https://staticseekingalpha.a.ssl.fastly.net/uploads/2016/9/18/114885-14742459845290782.jpg)

Their costumers using this type of ad more and more, this means it brings more returns than regular ads.

* $56 Million in-debt

That's poor management (Not necessarily, they have grown a lot), though it probably paid off seen their net income increase. Most likely being pressured to go public by investors? Also, they have enough Cash to almost pay this off, so they are definitely not worried about the Debt.

* TTD currently runs a deficit of ($28,290,000).

Hm.

* According to management, as of June 30, 2016, the firm had $37.6 million in cash and net working capital of $105.4 million. They believe that this existing cash + net IPO proceeds + remaining portion of credit facility will cover TTD's working capital requirements for &gt;12 mos.

That's a lot in Working Capital. Definitely solid enough for it to be successful! Specially with the extra capital from the IPO.

* CFO Paul Ross has held his position since 2014. He has previously held positions at Genmark Diagnostics, Teledata Technology Solutions, Meade Instrument Solutions, PowerOne Incorporated, British Petroleum, and BP Arco. Mr. Ross holds an undergraduate degree from the University of California at Los Angeles, and he earned his MBA at the University of Southern California.

Definitely a CFO who know what he is doing ""British Petroleum.""

* As described in the firm's SEC Filings, CEO Jeff Green co-founded The Trade Desk and has served as its CEO since November 2011. His previous experience includes positions at AdECN, Experclick, eBound Strategies, and 411 Web.com.

The CEO seems not to be very good at management, considering that most of his other startups never caught on. This one is definitely going much further than any other ones. Plus, the extra Management help coming from the experienced CFO is probably much better than we think. I'm assuming CEO is just a title he doesn't want to give up because he was the founder. I respect that, specially seeing that they have been growing fast on these past years.

* Potential Competition: Google, Amazon, Microsoft Media Network and Others

Google is not a competition, they use their own ad thing, and basically just on Google and affiliated sites (Which is virtually the only websites accessed), however TTD's focus seems to be more... broad? So In my opinion, Google isn't a threat; instead Google might look into buying TTD out before they catch on, definitely keeping an eye out for that.

* Assuming an initial share price of $15 and earnings as of year-end 2015, TTD's P/E ratio of 38 falls well below that of Amazon (193.7), and just slightly above those of GOOGL (30.9) and MSFT (27.3).

That's a good P/E for an IPO, not much else to say.

-----

Well, that's my personal opinion. So... Definitely worth checking it out. I won't give my personal opinion about the price, just that everyone should keep an eye out for A) A possible buyout, or B) An insane growth, becoming a huge company within the next 10 years. Also, they have virtually no one who competes against them when it comes to this ""Style"" of ads. Plus, it has a ton of points it can work on, so they can definitely increase the Net Income.

And my final point is that they have no physical product, which means that this is much more profitable than a lot of things out there. This is why the Net income is good, because of the fact that they don't need to produce anything, and they don't have many employees, it's just a platform.

My little brother died almost two years ago. He was eighteen.

He turned 18 in March 2014 and died in November 2014.

My parents live in California. My brother was born and died in California.


A great aunt had purchased stock certificates in our names (in 2002, in California) when we were minors - with our mother listed, UTMA.

There was no brokerage. My great aunt purchased a paper certificate in his name and it sat in a safety deposit box for fourteen years.


Mum spoke to Edward Jones and they said she'd have to speak to a lawyer and do a transfer through probate. 

Mum waited three or four hours today to speak to a pro bono lawyer (my parents are disabled and poor) who then told her that she couldn't help. 


My brother had basically just become a legal adult.

He wasn't ill, he died suddenly in a car accident.

He had no will. There is no estate. He lived with my parents and everything he owned was purchased by my parents (or, you know, birthday/holiday gifts from friends and family).


What can my mum do to be able to sell this stock (it's not even worth much... probably about 1k, but that's a lot when you're broke)?

A bankrupt stock that is going to be canceled has 4 times it's average volume and upswing in price...","I'm admittedly ignorant when it comes to the inner workings of a lot of this. But here's the backstory... my dad told me last week that he was investing in Arch Coal (ACIIQ) because he believed they would emerge out of bankruptcy in a good position. He bought tons of shares at 25 cents or so. I told him that he should probably sell as soon as he could because Arch Coal recently had their restructuring plans approved by the courts which includes the cancellation of the old common stock (ACIIQ) and that they didn't believe the old shareholders to get anything after their debts were paid. They also state this on their website's [FAQ Page](http://www.archcoal.com/restructuring/pdfs/FINAL%20ACI%20Agreement%20-%20Chapter%2011%20Investor%20FAQ.pdf).

My dad took my advice and sold. He actually managed to make a profit by selling close to 30 cents. But now he's upset because the stock is up to 40 cents today and the trading volume is 3-4 times it's average. This leads him to believe I'm wrong and that something unexpected is going on here.

My question is, is there something I'm missing here? Why in the hell is this stock being traded at higher volumes and at a higher price when the official restructure plan and their own website seem to indicate that this is completely worthless stock that will be cancelled once they emerge from bankruptcy? I want to better understand what's going on here.

Thanks!

EDIT: Also, another reason my dad thinks I'm wrong about this is because he said JP Morgan upgraded this stocks rating to ""Neutral"" last week, and that they ""wouldn't do this if the stock was worthless""",12

16-09-20,53p4gz,I was once straight. Hear me out.,"WSB,

I suck dicks for a living from my home. You can call me a ""professional faggot"" if you want I guess, but I would never label myself that way, I'm just someone who's managed to survive his autistic journey and make it to the 'consistent dick-sucking' stage. For transparency sake, I'll say this right now, I'm not straight. I'm 24 years old and my liquid assets total only around 600 tendies. I keep a modest dildo collection of 260 and withdraw any rusted cocks at the end of the month over that number. I've survived my faggot journey and I was able to achieve consistency using my 260 dildos to pull out 100-110 dicks per year from my ass. It's not a huge amount and I'm sure many of you store more dildos than me, but with my 100 tendies allowance I'm able to live comfortably, provide for my autistic children, and spend 3 hours per day 'working' and the rest of my time doing activities and hobbies I enjoy (sucking dicks). I go rimming a lot. My tendie asset size grows every year thus slowly but surely I take more and more dicks with each new year. I increase the amount of dildos I allocate for anal self-stimulation (how many dildos I can keep in my asshole) by 5% every 6 months or so.   

Not too long ago (maybe ~5 years back) I was once like many of you. I had a tiny dick, and I blew homeless guys in back alleys hoping for big black cocks and once in a while sucked a few good dicks but it seemed like I always ended up sucking AIDS-ridden lepers for 50 cents a pop to make ends meet. For some reason back then I could never achieve consistency. 

I would suck dicks based off ads in dirty bathrooms or what other people told me, I would suck dicks based off free drinks or the promise of a Big Mac, I would cup the balls, but my methods were always random, and as a result my consistency was always random.

I'm writing this post because a week ago I decided to visit WSB again for the first time in a very long time and see what was going on. I was seeing faggots making the same mistakes I used to make, having the same issues I used to have, people taking micro dicks with chlamydia, and for what? There's no reason any of you should suck sub-par dicks if you can take the time to plan and learn how to suck them properly.

Here are a few things I learned over the years that helped me achieve dick-sucking nirvana and that could help some of you out as well.

1. Always cup the balls. Why would you ever suck a dick without cupping? That's your shield, your one and only defense against the millions of faggot whores out there trying to take your money. Your ball-cupping should be wide enough to fully grip the entire sack, but tight enough that should your man begin to convulse with pleasure you can keep a tight grip. It hurts when you're sucking that dick and he just won't come, but more often than not, your ball-cupping will get you out early if you're pressed for time. Remember Lance Bass, for example? Because of well placed ball-cupping I was able to convert him from semi-straight to fully gay. **I cupped his balls based on the length of his balls and sack. Multiply testicle length by 2 and use that as your primary cupping width.** If sack length goes more than 300% beyond testicle length (typically this will be 100-200% for most 'normal length' cocks) there's no need to baghold the testes, just cut it and move on to the next one.

2. Learn how to take a dick like a fucking man. If a faggot ever tells you he's never sucked a dick - RUN. Run as fast as you can in the other direction. They're bullshitting you. No dick is perfect, and you will taste bad ones, exactly in the same fashion that a butcher has to pay for his meat, or a farmer has to pay for seeds. However your good dicks will outnumber your bad dicks vastly if you learn to cup balls early and let winners run (using a trailing stop of course).

3. This is the most important one. Relax the jaw to deep throat. I want you to think about a snake. There’s a saying that “if you want to suck a dick like a champion, you need to guzzle that shit in the back of your throat.” This has a lot to do with practice. A dick won’t fit every single time, every now and then you'll have to surrender to a customer who won a genetic jackpot, had a couple Viagra pills, or forgot to groom his giant bush. **But a dick-sucking faggot is an extremely profitable business, so where’s the money come from? Well it comes from deep-throating. A faggot doesn’t need to deepthroat every time to make money, it just needs to deepthroat most of the time** - say 55-60% of the time. This means that across a large enough sample size, across all the faggots, a faggot whore will still come out on top, because their edge in deep-throating allows them to keep more profits than they lose.  Your dick-sucking should be meticulous and consistent much like OP's mom. You chose an edge (whether it’s licking the tip, tickling the balls, or swirling your tongue) that you know gives you a high probability of winning, and you take that edge, **with the same exact position size and entry method every single time. If you are disciplined enough to do this, and if your deep-throating is truly an edge in dick-sucking, then you will see a slowly increasing customer base.** You will lose some customers, but across a large enough sample size, doing the exact same sucking with the exact same position over and over will result in consistent and reliable profitability from the faggots. 

4. Take on the right dick size. Aim small, miss small. **One of the biggest mistakes new faggot whores make is taking on dick sizes too large for their mouth and throat.** Think about it, would you rather suck 10 NBA player dicks for $5,000, or 10,000 normal-sized dicks for $100,000? Sucking 10 NBA player dicks for $5,000 leaves no room for error. It’s all or nothing. Every dick that goes against you will cause an emotional response that can cause you to abandon your plan and bail out of a good dick-sucking early. Meanwhile, sucking smaller dicks for less money per dick to get the $100,000 account is stress-free because your dick size is small compared to those gargantuan 10-inchers, and if the dick is disease-ridden you are not affected as severely by the loss. Remember to choose your dick size appropriately so that as discussed above, your edge in deep-throating has enough time to work itself out over a large sample size. **The last thing we want is you to vomit on a famous dude's dick because it's too huge.** Recommended dick sizes differ with every person, I have seen people trade with extremely conservative numbers such as 4.5 inches of total dick per faggot, all the way up to the bigger risk takers staking 6.5 or 7.5 inches on a single dick. Do the math and figure out what dick size works best for your situation.

5. Always collect cash up front. Before you even think about locking yourself in that back room, you should already know 1. Why you are sucking this dick? 2. Is this a rational reason to suck this dick and does it yield a high probability of cash pay? 3. What is my entry strategy, am I relaxing the jaw first and going straight for the deep-throat or cupping the balls, or both? 4. Does this dude have any warts or open sores around his shaft? 5. What will be my cash-taking strategy, and how much do I expect to make off this sucking? Will I collect it all up front, or do I trust him with half? At what length of time will I give up finishing him? Dick-sucking without a plan can have devastating effects and introduces human emotion and impulse into the equation. When it comes to sucking dicks, human emotion and impulse are two extremely detrimental things. If we blow dudes with a pre-determined plan we limit our chances to horrible STI situations and poor dick experiences.

6. Don't over suck. Sucking too much can hurt you more than you know. As faggots it’s crazy to think that realistically, 70% of our day is spent waiting for pants and briefs to unfold, and 30% is spent actually initiating the dick-sucking, deep-throating, or cleaning up the cum. Some days we don’t take any dicks because we don’t see any good dicks in the field. **Your best chance for success is to pick 2 or 3 frequent customers and wait patiently for them to show themselves on your doorstep. If you don’t see a good dick you like, don't accept the offer, simple as that.** And when a good dick setup does occur, you should already have a plan for how you’ll be sucking that dick. **Dick-sucking should be boring like factory work. If you want entertainment or thrills, go to Disneyland.**

7. Your job as a faggot should be first and foremost to protect your mouth and throat from possible damage and loss, only once you have done that can you begin to think about making any money in the dick-sucking market. If you end up remembering just one thing after reading all the information, please remember this quote: “Amateurs focus on slobbering giant knobs. Professionals focus on taking average dicks with perfect form.”

Over the past few years I've literally done the same dick-sucking setup over and over: The Marilyn Monroe executed on Daily or Weekly sucks. Mastering my setup and taking it with the exact same dick size every time, the same deep-throating, and cash pay up front has allowed me to see a steadily rising revenue curve with only the minor draw-downs due to my infatuation with dildos and tendies. If your 1 chosen setup doesn't appear in a customer, just don't suck that day. You don't have to suck dick every single day to be a successful faggot.

Suck dick with the same amount of effort each time no matter how confident you feel ""this time"" or how good the shaft looks right now. Chose whichever setup works best for you, I personally use the Marilyn Monroe and do it over and over again. If your setup is truly an edge in customer satisfaction you'll see a steadily rising revenue curve over time, and you too can achieve dick-sucking nirvana. **Remember: Ignore the homophobes and follow the money.**

If you want a good book or two to read, these 3 have helped me vastly in developing myself into a consistent faggot:

Ball-cupping for Beginners - Mark Douglass

Disciplined Sucking - Mark Douglass

Mastering the Deepthroat (2012 version not 2005) - John F. Carter

I realize many of you are on a budget or just starting out your faggot journey, you can easily find Mark Douglass' books for free in PDF form online. John Carter's book is around $40 on Amazon, but it is easily worth it's weight in tendies.

Good luck.

16-09-21,53rimn,Corporate Bond Bubble?,"I live in Newport Beach . I am heavily into State surveillance and all the types of technology that come along with it. I browse and scan High Rises every so often in order to try to identify if there could be anything used to listen, watch the public.

What I found isn't indicative of anything that should happen in the short term future. But it is pretty odd. There is this type of technology called STTW. In its early stages back in 2001 it could identify things that were 20 feet away and behind concrete barriers. Now it has come along way and MAY, may be able to identify things vastly farther away, I am talking about inside office buildings.

I am writing this post because I would like something that has my theory written down so I can go back to it and say, hey it was right, or it was wrong.

But it appears as though there is a STTW on top of a hotel right next to PIMCO's headquarters in Newport Beach, CA. It seems as though it is looking directly at the office building. I would like to get a friend's drone and hover it above to check it out even more but at this time I can't.

If there is something/someone trying to investigate Pimco it likely isn't because Pimco is doing anything wrong or illegal, although that could be the case. I do not know much about the company besides the fact it sells bonds.

But if this possible surveillance is indicative of anything it could be that bond's are going to be the next bubble. I found this Device two years ago and there has been more and more talk about a Bond Bubble. Bill Gross even started to talk about it.

Who knows though.

Anyone have thoughts on Corporate Bond's and a potential bubble?

16-09-21,53rwhb,DD: AMAG Pharmaceuticals (AMAG),"AMAG got some attention around here last year when it was riding high. I actually had it for a short time and sold before the plunge, but that was uncharacteristically speculative on my part. Now that it’s low, though, it’s a lot more interesting to me. I’d never have it as a core holding, but I’m considering buying in with a small position and seeing where it goes.

AMAG’s huge spike in 2014 coincided with an equally dramatic surge in revenue, from $25.50/share in Q3 2014 to $123.9 in Q2 2015. Over this timeframe the share price roughly tripled. The share price has now fallen to early 2014 levels, while revenue has increased again YoY, although not as dramatically. The company’s sales continue to grow at a rapid pace. The company also has ample cash to burn if it has to.

I have some reservations about the company’s RoE and RoI (both negative). The company is also carrying more than its market cap in debt. Earnings were negative this quarter, but around this price the company was trading between 4 and 5 times earnings when profitable.

Some numbers that might be of interest:

| Ratio | # |
|:----|:----|
| Forward P/E | 3.91 |
| Price/Book | 0.92 |
| Cashflow/Share | $1.57 |
| Cash/Share | $16.00 |

It seems to me that the company is very cheap right now based on revenue and underlying assets, and I’m inclined to believe it can pretty much start making money whenever it wants. It isn’t the safest play in the world, but as a stock that has taken an absolute beating I think you could do a lot worse.",2

16-09-22,53yhbo,From net income to cash flow formula,"Hi,

I would like to know how I get from net income to free cash flow for a firm in a given year. I have learned the following formula:

Net Income
+Depreciation
-Capital Expenditures
-Change in Working Capital

= Cash Flow to the firm

I understand the first 2 lines, however, I do not understand why you would subtract change in Working Capital. Let's say you get 10 million cash from a SEO and nothing else changes, this brings your Cash Flow to the firm down by 10 million? Does not make sense, right. 

If I assume non-cash Working Capital (non-cash current assets), we can take the example of increased inventories. Let's say the firm has +10 million in inventories. This brings cash flow to the firm down by 10 million. As this 10 million is not recorded at the income statement (COGS but the 10 million is not sold), cash flow decreases by 10 million. Is it then true that inventory is always recorded as the amount that was paid for it?

Hope you can help me out. Obviously an important concept to grasp!

Kind regards

16-09-21,53suoq,Show r/investing: Google Sheets Portfolio Tracker,"Hey r/investing!    

I dabble in investing and am trying to get more serious.  The Rule Breaker Investing podcast made me realize I need to track my performance and “keep score”.  My broker does a good job of showing me the “current state” of my positions, but historical performance gets lost.    

So, I started using Google Spreadsheets to create a basic portfolio tracker.  The sheet automatically retrieves price data for my holdings, then creates a historical chart of my portfolio value, like [this chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/176OttKoJWXlbpv97V50GwUDWlHRLIOIkmv0TIxWc3cc/pubchart?oid=1910859930&amp;format=image).    

I’m working on improvements to automatically update and email the latest chart to myself every Saturday morning.    

I also have other ideas.  For example, I’m a big fan of [Magic Formula investing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_formula_investing) and want to automate that trading strategy for myself.    

Has anyone done anything like this before?  
Anyone else interested in building/using something like this?    

Happy Investing!  

Edit: Someone asked if the total portfolio value is static - it's not, I was just showing a very short time period.  I've updated the dates to show the total value changing over time, in case that wasn't clear.  ",8

16-09-21,53vp52,Political Investment Strategy,"OK, so this might be too political and if so, feel free to delete - no controversy intended, but recently there has been additional talk surrounding potential negative immediate impacts to the stock market should Trump win unexpectedly.

What strategies could a more typical investor with sums in the thousands not the many millions do to protect in the case of an upset? 

This would all be said with the recognition that primary investment strategy shouldn't change, long-term goals remain, and that timing the market is never a good idea, but theoretically: what could one do to protect against a drastic market change following an unexpected win. I recognize that if the polling is close leading into the election that the uncertainty is likely already priced into the market - the question her is a surprise upset. ",0

yields will remain more or less at the current level (around zero percent)."" To me, this doesn't really make sense. CB buying of bonds will push yields down. They make no mention of selling bonds, but that is what they would have to do to push the 10yr from negative territory toward 0. There's definitely a lot of uncertainty here given they also removed their duration range and effectively abandoned the monetary base target. Anyone have insight in what the bank can actually do to maintain this 0.0% 10-yr target, especially whenever there is a dip into negatives?

I have seen much interest lately on reddit regarding the use of technical analysis to make stock choices. Seeing as how I have been trading using primarily technical analysis for the last few years, with success, I figured now would be a good time to begin sharing some of my short-term trade ideas.

Once a week (or more frequently), I scan through hundreds of stock charts looking for great potential plays using technical analysis. Each trade idea has the Risk v. Reward spelled out, as well as ideas of what I believe a good entry and exit would be.

16-09-21,53tgjv,Anyone in on DUST ?,"I just have a gut feeling of a rate hike and considering going in, my thesis is since Trump called out Yellen being Obama's employee, not being independent, this is FED's last chance to raise the interest rates before a president is elected. 

Therefore this is FED's last chance to regain credibility and emphasize on their objective, non biased standpoint, which is highly lacking currently, and important in government organizations. 

However I know odds are against a rate hike, but I cant see this fake all highs continuing for much longer. Is there anyone betting on a rate hike today ?? If so what are the tickers you are playing ??

**EDIT: below is from marketwatch article**


**Federal Reserve**

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will meet on Sept. 20-21. Here is what you need to know.

•The FOMC members are split between leaving the benchmark rate unchanged and increasing it by 0.25%.

•The market consensus is for no rate rise.

•The market consensus is also that Fed statement will be slightly hawkish indicating a rate rise in December.

•The main reason the market believes there will not be a rate rise is the upcoming presidential election.

•Trump has accused Fed of being political.

•The Fed has the opportunity to raise the rate in September and counter the argument of the Fed being political.

Knowing this would happen, what if the founders of RH decided to make the app a simulator instead of an actual trading app?

Then, they let your account value grow or shrink mirroring the investments you choose. Hence, no commissions - they never trade stock unless they are buying or selling to invest/withdraw funds. It's the perfect idea- assuming RH can make a safe 7%/year on their money pool and the average faggot makes 3% or less, they are simply raking in cash.

16-09-21,53w4pc,"stockAday: keeping the lights on with Vanguard's Utilities ETF? ($VPU)","# Vanguard Utilities Index Fund

Well if looking at ETFs is a snore, how about a real sleeping pill? The Utilities sector!

|Ticker|[VPU](https://stockflare.com/stocks/vpu)
|:---:|:---:|
Sector | Exchange Traded Funds
Latest price | $110.56
Value | $2.2 billion
Daily vol | $20 million
Date | 22 Sept 2016

### Useful Links
* Latest analysis from [ETF.com](http://www.etf.com/VPU) and [ Morningstar](http://www.morningstar.com/etfs/ARCX/VPU/quote.html)
* Website: [vanguard.com](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0960&amp;FundIntExt=INT)

# Description

* Seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of stocks in the utilities sector.
* Includes stocks of companies that distribute electricity, water, or gas, or that operate as independent power producers.

# Strategy *EDIT*

*Added on Thurs morning: cos it's key missing analysis!*

It the age old arguments between: passive investing &amp; active; small cap v large cap; equities v bonds; cyclical stocks v defensives... investing in $VPU is a clear vote to actively allocate your savings to a Defensive Sector.

But in a Yellen World, defensive is *not* what it's performed like. In fact on a 5 or 10 year view, 3 out of 4 defensives have beaten the market, substantially, with the 4th in-line with the market.

|Ticker|Sector| 5 years|10 years|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|$VTI | Total Market | 11% | 8% | 
|Defensives |  |  |  |
|$VDC | Consumer Staples | 15% | 12% | 
|$VHT | Health Care | 17% | 11% | 
|$VOX | Telecom | 11% | 8% | 
|$VPU | Utilities | 14% | 9% | 
|Cyclical |  |  |  |
|$VAW | Materials | 6% | 7% |
|$VIS | Industrials | 11% | 7% |
|$VCR | Consumer Discretionary | 15% | 10% |
|$VGT | Info Tech | 12% | 10% | 
|Other |  |  |  |
|$VDE | Energy | -1% | 4% | 
|$VFH | Financials | 10% | 0% |

So given that [mean reversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_reversion_(finance) is probably the most powerful long term force in finance, should we be a little cautious about these highfliers? Especially since we are at the start of the Fed's tightening cycle.

# Efficiency / Fees

So fee's for Vanguard's Utility ETF are best in class compared with iShares and SPDR. Though at a $2bn of assets, it's rather a lot smaller than SPDR's $8bn. 

|Metrics|Expense Ratio| Tracking Error|Uses Derivatives|Stock Lending Fees|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Vanguard's Utility $VPU | 0.10% | -0.05% | No | 100% to Fund :) |
|SPDR's $XLU | 0.14% | -0.15% | No | 100% to Fund :) |
|iShares' $IVV | 0.44% | -0.48% | No | 70% to Fund :/ |
|Vanguard's $VT (for a benchmark) | 0.14% | -0.09% | No | 100% to Fund :) |

# Asset Allocation

The asset allocation won't shock you, it's all in Utilities with 60% in Electric Utilities 30% in Utilities that do everything, and virtually no pure play gas, water, renewables firms. To put this in context, the Utilities sector is only 3% of the overall US market...and about as much a minnow as the Basic Materials and Telecom sectors are.

# Valuation

Let's compare Vanguard's Utilities ETF to the SPDRs Utilities ETF and for good measure to Vanguard's Global ETF.

|ETF| VPU | XLU | VT |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|No. of stocks| 80 | 30 | 7,482 |
|Median size| $23bn | $33 bn | $33bn |
|PE ratio| 22x | 18x | 22x |
|Earning growth| 2% | 5% | 7% |
|Dividend yield| 3.3% | 3.3% | 2.8% |
| % foreign| 0% | n/a | 47%|

Vanguard's Utility ETF seems to be a different beast to SPDRs. With SPDR much more concentrated and a little ""cheaper"".

But putting that aside for a minute, what are we trying to achieve by buying this ETF. Okay, you'd think it was a defensive, anti-cyclical business, but is that reflected in the valuation when you compare with the global ETF. Hard to see that!

# Well?

So looking at ETFs, I like to come to think of 3 questions (1) Am I happy with the asset itself? (2) happy with this specific strategy? (3) Happy with the provider of the ETF?

1. Well, this is a equity ETF in the US. And sure, that's a great place to invest, long-term. So no concerns there.

2. But the strategy of just investing in Utilities? Okay, they are boring cashflow businesses, but they are hugely capital intensive. And there doesn't seems to be much of a relative valuation play going on here. Why invest in this very narrow segment? It's tough to see the logic.

3. And finally, what about Vanguard... well it's hard to fault their metrics in terms of cost, efficiency or safety. Seems to be a least as good as SPDR or iShares.

16-09-21,53w7rq,Scottrade charged me a $20 reorganization fee after I told them to close out my account. Is there anything I can do?,"Sorry if this isn't the right place to post this. When I had Scottrade I was more or less learning to trade stocks. After the Scottrade breach, I requested a check for my funds and told them to close out my account. Fast forward 3 months later, I get an email from them saying my account is -$20 for 2 days and I must fund it to pay the neg. balance.   
   

Long story short, it was a $20 reorganization fee for having 1 share of GBSN. I remember when I told them to close it, that one share would have cost more in broker fees than the stock was worth. I looked at my history and saw this was the 3rd $20 reorganization fee they've charged me for having this stock ( 2 prior to me saying close out my account).   
    
Is there anything I can do? I emailed them and received this response:    
    

I am writing in response to your recent message concerning the mandatory reorganization fee that was charged to your Scottrade account.
 
Per our commission and fee schedule, your account was charged a $20 mandatory reorganization fee. This is a flat service fee for the processing of the corporate action and the actual value of the underlying security involved is not a factor.
 
A mandatory reorganization is a corporate action initiated by the company that impacts all shareholders – participation is mandatory and no action needs to be taken by the shareholders. A couple common examples of mandatory reorganizations include reverse stock splits and mergers.
 
Please visit our Brokerage Commissions and Fees Schedule page to view our complete commissions and fee schedule including possible miscellaneous service fees.
 
Thank you for choosing Scottrade®.

I saw digx gained 400% I looked into a bit further and it's because their earnings had 111% gain with a profit of $157,000.


After some googling I found their website: http://www.digitunder.com/ through this website: http://investorshub.advfn.com/Dig-It-Underground-Inc-DIGX-1029/ there already seems to be a lot of discussion going on there about it.

Now I'm not here to hype it up or pump and dump, but I'm curious if this stock actually has any promise? They were originally a hair care place and they recently bought a chiropractic business.

I imagine some entrepreneur is buying up small businesses in Texas to make help make passive income.. So I wonder where could it realistically go from here? I thought penny stocks are usually small businesses that have large debts and make no income yet. But here is a small business that is making a lot of income and expanding. Yet it's still trading for 0.0005 cents.

----

With that out of the way... Macro. My favorite part of investing is studying the macroeconomic view. Micro has its place, but it can be very math-heavy, calculating ""beta"", Sharpe ratios, and so on. Macro, on the other hand, is more philosophical. There are many different economic schools, each with different outlooks and explanations. A good macro theory helps to make sense of long-term trends.

Here's my current operating theory: Eight years after the 2008 crash, the stock market has largely recovered. Interest rates have been near-zero for a long time, and the Fed is anxious to start raising them back to ""normal"" levels. They've begun taking baby steps.

But it won't work.

## Thesis: Interest rates will be lower for longer

The primary change that has affected the economy is the massive shift of wealth to the upper class. In the words of Warren Buffet, ""Through the tax code, there has been class warfare waged, and my class has won. It's been a rout.""

Chain-emails about buying beer aside, the ultra-wealthy have extremely low tax rates in the United States. The highest marginal tax rate in the US is 35% (before state tax). But this is a tax on *labor* rather than *capital*. It's a tax on the upper-middle-class, not the true upper class. Take a look at this chart:

[Effective Tax by Income](http://ipr.cua.edu/blogs/assets/content//Average%20Tax%20Rate%20by%20AGI%20Class.jpg)

At the extreme right, effective income tax starts going down because the upper-class makes most of their money through capital investment. They don't pay 40% income tax, they pay 15% capital gains tax. If the chart extended into $100M or $1B, you would see it drop even lower. Warren thinks this is pretty unfair, and has proposed the ""Buffet rule"" which imposes a minimum 30% tax on incomes above one million dollars.

Some wealthy oppose the Buffett rule -- ""I spend less than 1% of my income on living expenses and invest the other 99% on creating new businesses and increasing the productive capacity of existing businesses."" Sounds good in theory. The wealthy mostly invest and spend little. On the other end of the spectrum, the poor spend nearly all of their income and save little.

Okay, so what? ""Fairness"" aside, what are the effects of our current tax scheme?

&gt; In free-market capitalism, capital generates income for the owners of the capital, which in turn is used to create additional capital. This is very good. Sometimes, it can be actually too good. As capital continues to accumulate, its owners find it more and more difficult to deploy it efficiently. The business sector generally must interact with the household sector by selling goods and services or lending to them. When capital accumulates too rapidly, the productive capacity of the business sector can outpace the ability of the household sector to absorb the increasing production.

—[Lance Brofman, ""A Depression With Benefits: The Macro Case For mREITs""](http://seekingalpha.com/article/1543642-a-depression-with-benefits-the-macro-case-for-mreits)

Let's take a simplistic example: Company X pays a dividend of $1/share, and shares are currently listed at $10 each on the stock market. That means a 10% dividend.

As more and more capital accumulates, demand increases for assets like Company X stock. Over time, the stock price rises to $50/share even though the dividend has not changed. Even though the company still pays $1/share, the dividend is now merely 2%! That's the effect of too much capital. Asset prices are outpacing the increase in productive capacity, driving down yields.

You hear a lot of yelling about how financial assets are ""overvalued"" right now. Stocks are too expensive, bonds are too expensive. EVERYTHING is too expensive relative to the past. That's because we have a glut of capital and nothing to do but keep buying assets.

----

Inflation has a shitload of different definitions depending on who you ask. Even when people agree on the general definition, there are several different ways of measuring it. Do you use CPI? PCE? ""core"" inflation, without energy? the price of gold? All of these measures will give you different answers. However there are common trends.

Let's specifically talk about inflation in consumer goods, which is roughly what CPI and PCE measure. If every American was suddenly gifted $10k, that would be inflationary. The vast majority of people would go out and spend it, driving up prices.

But a transfer of wealth to the upper-class is *deflationary*, since they save and invest it rather than spend it. This is exactly what happened with Reaganomics and ""trickle-down"" theory. The 80s had double-digit inflation, so cutting taxes on the wealthy (a deflationary pressure) was a very good idea. But those policies were never reverted.

In 2012, France elected a Socialist president who enacted the most progressive tax system among the 20 largest industrial nations. But if France had the same tax policy in 1969, it would have been the most *regressive* among those same nations.

There is such a buildup of capital around the world, that bonds have negative yield in some countries. It works the same way as my Company X example above. Suppose a 10-year bond is redeemable for $500 at expiry, but bonds are in such demand (due to their safety) that the price rises to $513. That's a -0.25% annual interest rate.

----

So, what's going to happen next? The Federal Reserve is trying to raise interest rates. They desperately want to get back to ""normal"". But the market is fighting them each step of the way.

In 2013 the Fed tried to transition back to normalcy and the market reacted violently, causing the ""taper tantrum"".

On December 16, 2015 the Fed raised the interest rate from 0.25% to 0.50%, and there was a pretty significant mini-crash.

Now the Fed is considering raising rates again. I strongly doubt they'll do it in November, just a week or two before the election. They're likely to hike in December in order to not lose _all_ credibility (remember when four hikes were planned in 2016?) If/when they *do* raise rates again, I expect another mini-crash, which would be a great time to buy into the market.

Until we take steps towards fixing wealth inequality, we're going to remain in a deflationary/low-inflation environment. The Fed might even have to reverse course and *lower* rates again. It would take *huge* political change to shift the economic landscape: raising rates on the wealthy, lowering rates on the middle-class, huge public investments in infrastructure, and so on. With Congress divided as it is, these changes are effectively impossible.

----

How to profit on all this? What sorts of investments do well in a low-interest-rate environment? Lance Brofman is recommending a few funds: MORT, MORL, and CEFL.

MORT https://www.vaneck.com/vaneck-vectors/income-etfs/mort/
This fund borrows money in order to buy mortgages. Since they are constantly taking short-term loans, they profit when interest rates are low (cheap to borrow). They have a pretty massive dividend yield of ~10%. However, as a REIT they are taxed funny. I plan to buy these in a Roth IRA to avoid paying extra taxes.

MORL http://etracs.ubs.com/product/detail/index/ussymbol/MORL
This is basically the same as MORT, but 2x leveraged. That makes them *even more* sensitive to interest rates. Currently yielding a whopping ~20% dividend. Crazy. Most leveraged assets have their leverage reset on a daily basis, which makes them risky to hold on a long-term basis. MORL is reset on a monthly basis, which makes it suitable for longer terms. See also the sister fund MRRL, which is the same thing but less liquid.

CEFL http://etracs.ubs.com/product/detail/index/ussymbol/CEFL
This fund uses 2x leverage to invest in closed-end funds that have high yield. It's pretty diversified, but is interest-rate sensitive due to its leverage. This also yields ~20%.

----

I'm still waiting for a good entry point to buy these, since I expect the Fed to raise rates at least one more time which should cause a significant price drop.

I'm not sure if gold/silver is a good long-term play or not. The market likes gold and silver as a hedge against central bank fuckery, but I don't think that inflation is actually a serious concern at the moment.

In the 90s there was a financial tool called an ""inverse floater"" that profited as interest rates stayed low or dropped. But they fell out of favor and not many brokerages offer them anymore.

[Account #2](http://i.imgur.com/YZ27Upz.png)


I started trading in March of this year. For a couple of months I traded stocks, but quickly taught myself the basics of options and have been trading exclusively options since then. I trade in my account as well as a family member's account, both of which have less than $10k each in them. 

I put together a trade log to see how my first earnings season turned out, and figured I would share here for the hell of it. I made a couple dumb emotional trades which lost a lot of money, as well as not managing some trades correctly, and using too much buying power at times which put me in potential margin calls... Lots of mistakes, but I'm starting to find what works for me and making consistent returns. 

General thoughts/comments:

* The total P/L number shown is minus commissions paid. 
* Total P/L is based on realized gains, I have not included unrealized (open) positions.
* Entries highlighted in red are ones that I rolled the initial position and am managing to try to get back to a scratch.
* Managing a trade could mean there's several instances of rolling either side up/down and out in duration for more credit.
* Was legging out of my BMY strangle (account #1) and caught the huge gap down while holding a naked put. Got assigned stock at $77 and have been selling covered calls ever since. Still down an unrealized $2K, fuck me.
* I was sure that RGR would beat earnings estimates and gap up (account #1) so I went balls out on long calls. They beat, but it gapped down and hasn't recovered since. &gt;$1k loss there.

The thing that irks me is that one of the oldest parallel banking frauds that a branch can run is using inactive and dormant accounts and routing transactions through these accounts under the radar.

But that is a really old thing and relied on the customer never knowing or reporting and hence it never coming to light. This is/was a piecemeal thing that individuals would pull in branches to make a little extra cash, park it here or there and get some interest of it, in some case even play the stocks or ponies and put it back in a day or two and no one was the wiser if things went well. Now a days, one place the money disappears is between the till and the ATM and some jokers have a running balance, as long as the ATM keeps getting replenished, nobody knows. If you don't check its a good time to see what in the cash dispensers :D

Running dormant/inactive accounts is old and Being an old trick, with modern centralized systems and central processing units, it has become obsolete because dormant and inactive accounts and their transactions are automatically flagged and observed by the Fraud or compliance guys. These accounts are also regularly reported to the regulator and any dollars or cents left in them rounded up and surrendered as unclaimed deposits.

This is a regular activity.

The scrutiny on accounts linked to credit facilities is even more stringent for obvious reasons. 

Needless to say, creating Accounts for the sole purpose of trying to meet sales targets and get bonuses does not gel because the first thing that is analyzed about such new accounts is that they are opened with fresh funds and the growth in the Liability side because of these funds is actively monitored. 

The thought that the bank would pay out bonuses and accept these accounts as targets is ludicrous because its the first thing that is looked at.

So the idea that ""Oh . .this is nothing great and only $2.6 million etc etc"" does not fly. 2 million of these accounts is no joke and there is noway that such a thing would be tolerated unless there was something very big happening in the background. Money laundering Big.

To really find out what it means, and its by no means a difficult task with centralized systems, a transaction record of these accounts should be investigated, to see what sort of activity was generated via these accounts.

Thats where the actual fun will be found.

# Description

Ubiquiti Networks provides networking technology to service providers and enterprises. The Company offers infrastructure for fixed wireless broadband, wireless backhaul systems and routing. It also provides wireless local area network (WLAN) infrastructure, video surveillance products, switching and routing solutions, and machine-to-machine communication components to large corporations.

So, despite that description, it's not a telecom provider but a hardware play. It's vendor of the hardware and supporting intelligence layer for radio systems, antennas, Wifi, etc. Think a mini Cisco, if you need an analogy. 

## Recent financials 

Sales have doubled over the last 5 years with the business moving into a profit and then doubling its earnings. 

|June year end|2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $0.7bn | $0.6bn | $0.6bn | $0.3bn | $0.4bn|
|EPS | $2.49 | $1.45 | $1.97 | $0.89 | -$0.12|

Though it's key to note that the recent growth has come from the ""Enterprise"" unit up 40% in the year. Where as the ""Service Provider"" units been flat to down. The transition of revenues is really only part of the way.

|June year end|2016A|2015A|2014A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Service Provider | $418m | $418m | $451m | 
|Enterprise | $248m | $178m | $122m |  

## Competition

Now there are some big names on the competitor list like Cisco, Motorola and Aruba Networks (now part of HPE), but the bulk of the names are unfamiliar. 

&gt; In the backhaul market, our competitors include Cambium Networks, Ceragon Networks, DragonWave, Mikrotîkls, Mimosa, SAF Tehnika and Trango. In the CPE market, our competitors include Cambium Networks, Mikrotîkls, Ruckus Wireless and TP-LINK Technologies. In the antenna market, we primarily compete with PCTEL, ARC, ITELITE and Radio Waves.  In the enterprise WLAN market, we primarily compete with Aerohive Networks, Aruba Networks, Ruckus Wireless and Cisco. In the video surveillance market, we primarily compete with Axis Communications, HIKVISION, Mobotix and Vivotek.  In the machine-to-machine communications market, we primarily compete with AlertMe.com, EnergyHub and Motorola.  

Looking at the metrics both margins and returns are impressive! And as their Enterprise division (Wifi for businesses) scales... perhaps the margins improve further?

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Ubiquiti Networks Inc | $666M | 36% | 50%
Cisco Systems, Inc. | $49,247M | 31% | 17%
Motorola Solutions Inc | $5,727M | 23% | 94%
Juniper Networks, Inc. | $4,887M | 22% | 14%
Arista Networks Inc | $974M | 21% | 18%
Ceragon Networks Ltd | $291M | 9% | 6%
Aerohive Networks Inc | $177M | -ve | -ve

## Cash / Debt?

Ubiquiti Networks Inc has $347M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 8% of the market value of Ubiquiti Networks Inc. So nothing to see here.

# Wall Street thinks?

But it's only when we come to the professionals on Wall Street that a really nasty wart appears. They have a $42 target for Ubiquiti Networks Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Hold_. A 22% downside to their target price is a real worry.

Though Wall Street's not showered itself in glory here. 3 months ago their target price was $34 when the stock was $40. 

# Valuation

Looking at earnings and growth, UBNT is clearly at the pricey end of the market. And that is despite a less exciting outlook on its growth.

# Dividends
Ubiquiti Networks Inc is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. Instead they focus on share buybacks. 

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 33% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 18%.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers they highlighted a couple of improvements in their kit. Said they'll be real catalysts for the business. But above all they said the new products are going to be

&gt; impactful materially to operator revenue, and Service Provider revenue, and I think you're going to see some growth in the Service Provider next year.

If that's true, and the business starts firing again on both cylinders, then who needs another catalyst? ;)

There is no single answer to this question, but we will also need A LOT MORE information if we are to give some sort of answer

* How old are you?
* Are you employed/making income? How much?
* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)
* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)
* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
* Any big debts?
* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.

16-09-23,544cf2,WSB memes are in Jeopardy,"The bigger a meme becomes the weaker it gets. Take To The Moon for an example. In the good ol' days ""to the moon"" was reserved for stocks that shot up 50%+ in a single day. Now, if a stock raises 5% in a day there are dozens of faggots posting TO THE MOON shitposts. To them I would like to say FU. YOLO, don't even get me started. These faggots think that putting 20% of your portfolio on a risky play (+ or - 20% swing likely) is a YOLO. Sorry but it's not. Let's save YOLO for the option guys buying short term OTM calls. Gain 400% or lose it all, now that's a YOLO. Shitty YOLO and To The Moon post are really starting to decay the true spirit of these memes, or maybe I'm just bitter because I'm down 20% in the last 30 days.

Step 4: Buy treasury bonds with the money you got from Step 3 (You of course have to make sure the interest you're paying is less than the yield on bonds)

We've got two fed speakers today at 12 &amp; 12:30, Patrick Harker and Robert S Kaplan. Neither of which have a vote, they are ""alternates"" on the FOMC. My limited research suggests Kaplan is a believer in rate hikes but is cautious. Patrick on the other hand seems to be a little bit more pushy on the rate hike.

Also, let's say I purchased 50 dollars worth of shares in $BAC on March 1, and sold it March 20 at 55 dollars. The capital gains tax will be  .75 but do they automatically take .75 out? Or will I have to pay when taxes are due next spring? 

Also finally, going with the same purchase and sell from the last example, what if I use the 55 dollars and buy $GPRO? Will the wash sale rule apply?
How does wash sale work?

I use Robinhood by the way

# Description

Disney remarkably diversified as an entertainment company. The Company's business segments include Media Networks, Parks and Resorts, Studio Entertainment, Consumer Products and their Interactive. They own a chunk of hulu and their branding is ever present. 

## Recent financials 

From $30 to $100 in 5 years, you can see why with the revenues, earnings and dividends!

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $52bn | $49bn | $45bn | $42bn | $41bn|
|EPS | $4.90 | $4.26 | $3.38 | $3.13 | $2.52|
|Dividend | $1.81 | $0.86 | $0.75 | $0.60 | $0.40|

But where's the growth come from? 

* In the last 2 years, revenues are up by $7bn, $3bn came from ""Media Networks"", $2bn from ""Resorts"", $1bn from ""Studios"" and $1bn from ""Products"". 
* Operating profit grew by just under $4bn with Media / Resort &amp; Studios adding a $1bn each, Products and Interactive adding the rest.
* Though note: Media is $23bn on the $52bn sales. And it is $8bn of the $15bn operating profit.
* If you are curious what the Media Networks business is, well, ESPN, the Disney Channels and ABC, really.

So the Media business is the powerhouse, but the profits come through in each division. And to some extent, I feel that Disney's different divisions re-enforce each other. 

## Competition

There is so much competition in this market, on every front for a parent or consumers $$$. So it's remarkable to see the longevity of the Disney franchises, the high margins and good returns. 

Now don't be fooled thinking this is a capital light business. Sure it doesn't have cables in the ground, but it does own resorts and other infrastructure. There's over $25bn of fixed assets!

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Walt Disney Co | $56,002M | 31% | 20%
Comcast Corporation | $75,973M | 33% | 15%
Time Warner Inc | $27,903M | 28% | 17%
Twenty-First Century Fox Inc | $27,326M | 23% | 18%
DISH Network Corp | $15,137M | 17% | 28%
CBS Corporation | $14,303M | 23% | 28%
Viacom, Inc. | $13,050M | 27% | 59%

## Cash / Debt?

DIS has $15,214M of net debt. That is 0.9x it's latest operating profit. So all's fine there. Doing deals, buying amazing franchises like Star Wars etc, is possible with that sort of leverage.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $108.63 for Walt Disney Co and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 16% to their target.

# Valuation

It looks like it's better value that Comcast and not too far off Time Warner or Fox. The clear ""cheap"" play is Viacom, but the management fight and long-term outlook make that look like a value trap.

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/dis/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
DIS | $150,119M | 16x | 11% | 2% | 9%
CMCSA.O | $162,316M | 19x | 13% | 2% | 12%
TWX | $60,135M | 14x | 13% | 2% | 9%
FOX.O | $45,611M | 13x | 14% | 0% | 0%
DISH.O | $25,037M | 18x | 2% | 0% | 7%
CBS | $22,279M | 12x | 17% | 1% | 9%
VIAB.O | $14,424M | 10x | -3% | 4% | 21%

# Dividends

Walt Disney Co forecast dividend of $1.41 compares to a forecast EPS of $5.79. So there would be room for a boost. Though they appear to prefer buybacks!

&gt;  The net use of cash in the current year included $6.1 billion of common stock repurchases and $3.1 billion in dividends

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -2% that compares with no change in the earnings forecasts. On a 6 month view the stocks off 6% with earnings forecasts shaved by 1%.

With the year end being Sept, perhaps the stocks in flux ahead of full year results?

Though on the management team's July call with Wall Street brokers they reminded everyone that 

&gt; that in our slate in fiscal 2017 is another Star Wars movie and a Cars movie. And Cars, before Frozen, was the number one Consumer Products franchise at the company. Not as big as Star Wars, but really significant. So – and we also have Spiderman being released by Sony but being made by us, as well as Thor in calendar 2017.

Given they've got the ""machine"" well oiled, will 2017 not be another bumper year?

16-09-24,548dez,Confessions of a Gold Bug,"As someone who's been investing in/trading gold since 2003, I want to share my experience in light of all the recent bullish posts on gold and gold derivatives. It's been an extremely rocky ride and I hope that my personal lessons can provide some insight for the current bagholders.  

**2003** - Bought 24K jewellery when gold was ~$425 CAD an ounce. Total weight 2.5 troy ounces. I was hooked to the allure of the shiny metal. Still wear this piece on my persons today.  

**2011** - Dabbled in 2x bull gold and silver Comex-based ETFs after the pullback from all-time highs. Couple grand here and there. Gold was poised to hit $2500 by year end. Get in while you can.  

**2012** - Started increasing bets like a madman as gold fell to $1600. Economic collapse was supposed to be imminent. QE is going to lead to hyperinflation. Averaged down way too often and on immaterial price drops. Positions crossed into 5-figure territory. Bought my first gold coin for $1650 CAD. Gold tried rallying back, but failed at $1780 resistance. Browser history become overloaded with Zero Hedge cookies.  
 
**2013** - Gold and silver tanked in Feb following a showdown between Ron Paul and Ben Bernanke regarding the Fed and inflation. Even bigger crash happened in April--a hundred dollar dive in 2 days. Continued to average down and threw all disposable income into the losing bets. Bought another gold coin at $1335 CAD and more 24k gold jewellery (2 additional troy ounces). Neck started looking like Mr. T.  
 
**2014** - The beating continued. Ran out of cash to average down with. Losses stood at over 50% and totalled somewhere in the neighbourhood of $25k-$30k. Sold all remaining 2x ETFs in Sep and cried in the bathtub naked. Left the cold water running for maximum humiliation. Gold fell further to $1145/ounce and silver $15/ounce by Nov.  
 
**Late 2014** - Regrouped remaining cash. Day traded NUGT a few times and got out with gains. Bought three more coins/bars for $1430 CAD. Initiated positions in SVM, which I detail in [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/4yy77e/the_difference_between_catching_a_falling_knife/).  
 
**2015** - Averaged into SVM slowly. Waited for real dips to buy after learning lesson from previous years. Precious metals became a smaller and smaller part of portfolio. Bought another gold coin at $1500 CAD. Realized that you can't fight the Fed and changed investment outlook. Gold bottomed at $1056 and silver at $13.75.  
 
**2016** - The reversal finally took hold. Gold and silver entered a new bull market. My SVM gains hit 3x (a 7x jump from the lows). Sold half in July. Booked a $10k profit. Still holding other half with unrealized gain of $11k.  Back to positive on physical holdings (coins and 24K jewellery).
 
**Lessons** - The world will not end overnight. Gold isn't going to $2000 tomorrow. The metals trade on a delicate balance between fundamentals, technicals, and sentiment. Do not bet the farm, especially on leveraged instruments. Watch the US dollar as that is the biggest catalyst in play at the moment. You have to be willing to baghold for years if needed. 3x ETFs are not well suited for that time frame. Always keep enough cash reserves to double down when (not if) you are beaten to your knees.  

**Outlook** - Gold will continue to go up as long as Central Banks exist. My parents who are holding at an average cost of $35/ounce can attest to this. I consider myself a big gold bug with the battle scars to prove it. Yet precious metals (physical and miners) account for only 7% of my net worth. Assess your own risk tolerance and ask if you're prepared to lose half or hold for years. If your objective is to make a quick buck via swing trading NUGT/JNUG, then at least heed the advice about averaging down slowly. Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.",38

16-09-23,546112,GDX will go lower.,I know after seeing GDX down 3% most of you are thinking that now is a good time to buy back into miners. Its not. Take a look at a daily chart for both silver and gold. [I posted yesterday about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/540j0c/speculative_bearish_reversal_on_gold/)  They both hit short term cyclical tops yesterday. The trend lines are very clear. This is the beginning a flush downward for both metals that should last through next week. There may be a bounce day somewhere in between and yes for all I know it could be Monday but the charts right now baring any new fundamental change are showing short term down trend in precious metals. I would not buy miners today. In fact there is still good enough odds to short them into next week.  Edit: a word,6

But ...

I've owned BNS385 since 2012. Since 2012 BNS385 outperformed the TSX by just about 25% and its ETF competetor by 32%. This is not unique just for that time period. It wins on the 5yr and 10yr as well.

It obviously costs more to own the mutual fund, maybe up to 2-2.5% more, but the fund still ends up on top.

Am i missing something?  Maybe the stock price seems higher for some reason I'm not considering....

16-09-23,546j6c,One last bullish post about JNUG for the week,"I'm making a shoutout to all the JNUG bagholders, I'm sorry you're currently getting fucked. Certain WSBers called that these last two days would be down days and unfortunately this time you listened to me and we were wrong, patterns that have existed for 8 months and been proven 5 times were not enough to fight past the resistance line.

There is still hope, the only people who have no chance of recovering from this in a reasonable amount of time are the people who choose to sell and avoid risk. If you're one of those people, you should probably go back to r/investing .

One of the WSBers who did call this correctly has expressed that next week he might play the other side. Another of which says there could be a ""bounce"" day next week but thinks the week overall is going to be down but he's still bullish on gold.

So where does that leave us? There is an FOMC meeting November 1-2nd. Every meeting except July-September JNUG has gone up between the end of the first and the start of the second. One in five! Pretty good odds especially considering JNUG is $19 right now and in July we were looking at $30. 2nd quarter of the year (taking into consideration splits) we were hitting resistance at $18. Maybe $18-19 could be our support level in the coming weeks.

I'm holding 135 shares with an average cost of $20.04 and a total return of -6% incase anyone is afraid I'm bullshitting and intentionally leading you down the wrong path. I've got $1500 just sitting in my account waiting for some more dips to lower my average cost, make no mistake - all that money is destined for JNUG if it keeps falling.

- This is in line with forecasts by Taiwanese/Korean companies, all of which see a ~20% decline in chip and memory orders. 

- Expensive $160 Airpods is one of the likely reasons why sales are so poor. Customers feel cheated as it shows how much Apple prefers money over customer choice. 

- Apple has failed to capitalize on Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 delay due to the lithium battery explosion problem.

- This sales decline trend will continue until Apple finds a new growth engine (will it be VR or cars or something else?).

The news:

""Shares of Apple slid on Friday amid speculation that German research firm GfK issued a report suggesting iPhone 7 sales would be lower than last year, based on data in Europe and Asia.

Apple shares dropped as much as 2.7 per cent as reports spread. The stock ended down 1.7 per cent at $US112.71 in New York.

Business Insider said people who have seen a copy of the report say it claims that iPhone 7 unit sales are down 25 per cent on an annual basis, compared with the iPhone 6S of last year. GfK's report doesn't measure sales in the US.

""Numbers on sales or market shares are confidentially provided to our clients and shall not be quoted or released to the public,"" GfK said in an emailed statement. ""We did not publish these figures for external release.""

An Apple spokeswoman didn't immediately comment on the report.

A Taiwan-based electronics newsletter Digitimes reported earlier Friday that Apple told its chip partners that iPhone 7 chip orders would fall about 20 per cent in the first quarter of 2017 from the previous quarter.""

""Shares of Apple (AAPL) suddenly moved sharply lower in afternoon trading around 1:30 pm, Eastern time, apparently because of remarks being attributed to market research firm GfK indicating some decline in the performance of sales of the iPhone 7 in Europe.

According to TheFlyontheWall, GfK’s “channel checks” show “that the iPhone 7 launch in Europe is down 25% versus the iPhone 6 launch. Apple shares are down 2%, or $1.86, to $112.76 in afternoon trading.”""

16-09-23,5472zx,Looking for a reason to hold out hope for markets..,"i just can't seem to shake the feeling that ""past returns are not indicative of future performance"" has never been more true than it is now. 

i think what has become and will continue to be increasingly difficult for the market to swallow is the fact that there are people that have left and are leaving the work force that will never come back, and more importantly, there are more and more jobs that are going to go the way of the dodo, thanks to technology and cost cutting. less people working means less spending, corporate revenues drop, and the cost cutters and buy-backers ride in on their white horses to save the bottom line. more people lose jobs to cost cutting...rinse and repeat. if i'm not mistaken there is more corporate debt now than there was prior to the financial crisis, and a lot of it has been used to manufacturing earnings via buybacks. that can't go on forever though, unless rates stay near zero forever. on the other hand, how can the Fed raise rates if it will lead to billions in paper losses for fixed-income investors and equity markets freak at the same time? they seem to be painting themselves further and further into a corner. and the longer they do, the further out on the risk curve they will push investors who are desperate for any yield, and the more painful it will be when the band-aid gets ripped off - if it ever does. where does that leave us? we get 1 hike a year, the bottom falls out, and we climb back up the well to face another hike and slip all over again? and so on until rates are more normal but markets have gone nowhere in who knows how long? and that's just in the U.S - forget about the rest of the world with their own problems!

i know what markets have returned historically over various periods of time, and the powers of DCA and compounding - but what if this is a complete paradigm shift? a new normal?

maybe i am thinking about it the wrong way, and i would love for someone to tear myview apart piece by piece, but nothing really appeals to me, anywhere, right now. ",5

It doesn't mean we won't eventually break through it but it does suggest gold will have to pullback first before eventually breaking it. Could we just break straight through it, sure, but odds say it will retrace and build a base first. 

-

To see what a possible retrace level would be I decided to run a fib (as you can see on the chart) from the top of the 2011 high all the way to the 2015 low and found that julys peak was a perfect 38.2% retrace from that fall. This is EXTREMELY significant. Now a lot of times fibs don't mean shit and charts will blow right past them but when they work a pattern that is very consistent is if it bounces off a fib level (like it just did) it will retrace back to the next one before bouncing again. Remember that fibs exist for a reason. They don't work all the time but when they do you should pay attention.

-

I'm not saying this will definitely happen but this pattern does have good enough odds of fulfilling because two technical patterns are suggesting a short term retrace. I know its blasphemy to say gold will drop below $1300 but I give it fairly good odds that gold will flush down the $1250 range in the next couple of months (or sooner) before later shooting up much higher.

I have about 28% bond etf in my portfolio and this is how it looks like currently:
US Gov long &amp; mid term bond etf: 3.7% (mainly long-term)     
US Corporate bond etf: 6.3% (mainly long-term)        
US municipal bond etf: 2.2%       
US high yield bond etf: 2.6% (mainly 0-5 years)      
US total bond etf: 4.5%      
UK Gov bond etf: 2.8%      
UK corporate bond etf: 6.4%

I wonder what could happen to my bond eft in case of the US rate increase which is likely to happen in the end of this year. I am aware that all US bond etf value will perhaps decrease in case of a rate rise. Should I sell my bond portfolio?

Thank you so much!",2

16-09-24,549u15,"Would a company's closing price every Friday for the past 1 year be useful to top management?","Hello, all! I'm very new to stocks, but I have a major project at work that I need to finish soon, so any help from you all would be great!

I work for a very big company. I'm assigned to create a info-graphic every month detailing all the ""external data"" that may be useful to top management (country's macro-economic indicators, commodity prices, etc.) It has to be very succinct as well, so I can only include the major indicators and trends that would be very helpful.

My boss declared he wanted to include a line graph tracking our company's trade price of its stocks for the past 1 year. While I was able to get that specific graph from our country's stock exchange website, I still need to convert that graph into numbers, and then graph it again myself (with a specific color scheme, aesthetics, etc.) to include into the infographic.

I'm not sure if it's feasible to get 365 data points (there's no table of data points, I literally have to move my cursor on the graph to see the price for each day). Plus, I only have 12 more hours before I have to finish this project. (to be clear, my boss only gave this instruction literally an hour ago)

**So my question is** is it acceptable to only track the trade price every Friday for the past 1 year (52 data points), instead of every day for the past 1 year (365 data points)? I chose Friday, cause my stock broker friend suggested it, but I forgot to ask why. I read about 'the Monday effect' and the 'Weekend effect', but is there any logic as to why the Friday price should be tracked on the graph? Will I lose any valuable information regarding how well the company's performance is doing, if I don't include the other 6 days? (remember this will just be on a small illustrative graph, as compared to the whole big picture)


As you can tell, I'm very new to do this, and any input at all would be fantastic. Thanks so much.",0

Twitter's stock has been garbage for some time now - actually one of the first stocks I bought.

Facebook has continually bought up every major social player it could get its hands on. WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. 

Facebook has wanted to buy Twitter in the early days, but Twitter thought it was going to the moon and refused. Now it's clear it won't.

Facebook's big push is in video right now. They're pushing Facebook Live and filling your feed with it, obviously with the hope that all TV watching will end up happening in your Facebook feed.

Twitter just nailed out an NFL agreement that caused the platform to see more growth than it has in a very long time.

16-09-24,54bh6z,Advanced stock analysis course,"I'm a senior investment analyst in asset management with a decade of investment experience. Besides my full-time job, I'm passionate about teaching others the fundamentals of investing. Some of you have seen my tutorial on distressed investing on my blog Buyside Focus. Thank you for your encouraging comments. 

I've been thinking about creating an online course on practical stock analysis.  Throughout my career I've taken many online open courses on investing. They are great resources and I applaud universities for creating open courseware. However, I've found them focused more on theories, macroeconomics, and portfolio allocation, and there isn't enough practical content on security analysis - including how to source potential long &amp; short ideas, develop investment thesis, value the company, and assess the risks.

So I want to gauge the community on your interest in such a course. What are your thoughts on the following 3 questions:

How are you currently learning about stock analysis? Do you feel like there's enough good practical content on analyzing stocks? (books, online resources/blogs, friends/industry contacts, open courseware, etc)

What would you like to learn from a practical equity investing course? (how to source ideas, develop investment thesis, valuation, etc)

Would you be willing to pay for an equity investing course?

Your answers will be very helpful in creating something that people want. Thanks!",334

Why do I love this stock? It's simple, they have virtually 0 customer attrition in a growing market place.  CNG is going to continue to grow for large business (Trucking, Metro Bus, Airports, UPS, Fedex, etc...).  There is no alternative on the market that will provide the same power for the price.  It is a no brainier for companies that rely heavily on large machines to lower the operating costs.  

Financial measures, the company has finally got the debt under control.  They have beat estimates consistently over the past 3 quarters and showing no signs of disappointing.  The commodity price will likely to continue to increase only helping top line revenue.  Construction revenue shows no signs of slowing, in fact I wouldn't be surprised if it continued to increase through 2017.  

Consumer market penetration, I see the average commuter to slowly adopt the technology.  On the road right now, there are simply basis points of the population using CNG.  If the tech picks up 1-2% of the market, the stock would be valued 2-3x on that metric alone.  The best part is that this is purely icing on the cake, no one needs the average commuter to adopt, the large vehicle contracts are enough to propel the stock well past $10.  

Most recent close, $4.30.  My Dec 2016 price target, $5.80.  My Dec 2017 price target, $8.10. 

On macro factors,  I think regardless of the election or what happens to i rates, the stock has upward momentum.  Both Trump or Clinton should be energy friendly due to the environmental and economic benefits of CNG (Obama admin has been as well).  If the i rate were to explode and the market took a correction my price targets would be affected. My personal models do not account for an increase to the interest rate.

It would've been better to short horses.

This is a pretty close similarity to the common ""invest in marijuana, it's going to be legal."" Well most likely it'll become legal, and some of these companies will make a fortune, but odds are, the company you pick will probably be like one of the many car companies that too went under.

To get investment ideas i would go online and read what people are saying. And pretty much I have allocated capital to certain investments for the following reasons:

- $35k in UWTI: If you look at the long term oil chart, it was at $140 not too long ago, and it's now at around $45, so do the math. 

- $40k in JNUG: Gold is the way to go for a safe haven, and why not buy a 3x leveraged stock? More gains for me when gold rises.

- $35k In TWTR: Twitter is apparently going to be bought by another company, hence why the price jumped. So I want to be in when they get bought out.

- $20k in MACK: Pharmaceuticals have BIG potential, so I want to be in when the next rally happens.

- $14k in TSLA: Automated cars are the future and Tesla is leading the way. Its a no brainer.


So what you think? I expect to make big gains by the end of the year for me and my parents. Gold, oil and electric cars are a no brainer and will most like rise in the future.",0

Some economists are saying more like 5 years, but I don't think China will hold out that long.

My basis for thinking China will melt down, is the accumulation of bad debt, and the Chinese government's overall deceptive practices to give the illusion of higher growth than really exists. At some point their economy will hit a wall and reality is going to re-assert itself. When this happens, I think China is going to be in for a much rougher time than the US had in 2008. 

Anyway, so my problem is translating this into investment. A lot of bear options seem to be short term, not something you hold for 1-3 years. I can figure that a lot of commodities will crash when China does, since the Chinese demand will go up in smoke. Does anyone have ideas as to how best to actually go about translating a bet that China will run into some sort of catastrophic meltdown into an actual investing position? ",7

16-09-25,54goua,Determining the number of contracts.,"How do you normally determine the number of contracts that you buy or sell? I see most people say they determine it by keeping the risk of the total amount of contracts between 2%-5% of their portfolio. 

I'm doing paper trading right now to learn the basics of buying and selling options in hopes that I can use it as a means of investing in the future.

To answer my question, you can read through the quick example below:

If a stock, XYZ, is trading at $15 and I wanted to do a short naked put at 0.46 cents then the most amount of money that I can make is $46 dollars per contract and minus commission ($10 per trade) brings me $26 max profit, correct? And the max risk (the stock going to $0) puts me at $1,454. Is the dollar amount of the risk of the stock going to $0 what I use to calculate how many contracts I buy? Does that mean I should have at least $29,080 - $72,700 in my portfolio for just one contract? Is that how most traders/investors do things? It seems like you need a crazy amount of money just to make a $26 profit within the ""Safty Zone.""

EDIT: Made a simple mistake. I put that my max profit would be $6 when it would actually be $26, and that is if I didn't let it expire.",2

There has been a hint at a potential takeover from some broker, however pure speculation, is this just someone who is holding a lot of shares he bought cheap and tipping off rumours to hike up the price in his/ her favour?
It looks risky, but seeing from where the share price came from it could be a good time to buy longer term, it could be worth a punt. Or is it headed straight for liquidation/ bankruptcy etc and there are just way too many red flags to consider this share as a buy.

# Description

Gilead Sciences is a biopharma/ biotech company. The Company's principal areas of focus include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), liver diseases, such as chronic hepatitis C virus infection and chronic hepatitis B virus infection, cardiovascular, hematology/oncology and inflammation/respiratory. 

The business is only 28 years old, but it's gone from zero to hero in that time. Just think... they've created over $100bn of value in just 28 years. Rarely do we see that outside of tech, isn't it. 

And it's not been luck. At least not all of it. They've done 20 acquisitions with many costing over $500m a piece. i.e. management's good at spotting pipelines to buy / integrate into their existing business.

## Recent financials 

And the results are clear to see:

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $33bn | $25bn | $11bn | $10bn | $8bn|
|EPS | $11.91 | $7.35 | $1.81 | $1.64 | $1.77|

Doubling sales in 2 years. Now that's a blockbuster, yes?

But of course, that's the ""annoying"" thing about pharma. Patents expire, generics pounce, and as quickly as the sales come, they go. Just see how Hepatitis C ramped...just in time... with HIV on a plateau.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Hepatitis C | $14bn | $2bn | $0bn |
|HIV / Other anti-viral | $16bn | $21bn | $9bn |
|Other | $2bn | $2bn | $2bn |

And the forecasts to come?

|Metric|2017E|2016E|2015A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Sales | $29bn | $31bn | $33bn |
|EPS | $11.62 | $11.76 | $11.91 |

So the stock is ex-growth :(

## Competition

There's competition everywhere, with GSK controlling ViiV Healthcare in the HIV space and with AbbVie, Merck and BMS chasing them in Hepatitis C. And sure, having the best drug on the market is an amazing moat... but the research bill keeps coming, the patent expiry clock keeps ticking.

Plus when you've got an operating margin and returns like Gilead, everyone's keen on your market!

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Gilead Sciences, Inc. | $32,371M | 66% | 103%
GlaxoSmithKline plc (ADR) | $32,656M | 27% | 1%
AbbVie Inc | $24,754M | 40% | 103%
Merck &amp; Co., Inc. | $39,444M | 37% | 11%
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co | $17,618M | 23% | 19%
Novartis AG (ADR) | $49,778M | 30% | 9%
Pfizer Inc. | $52,286M | 38% | 11%

## Cash / Debt?

Gilead Sciences, Inc. has $3bn of net cash. So with that at the ready and a good cashflow, they could do an acquisition deal at any moment. If only they can find the right pipeline to buy.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $106.11 for GILD and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 30% to their target. Tempting?

# Valuation

So, here's the shock. 7x earnings. It's hard to find a pharma stock that cheap. Let alone one with such an amazing history. But where GSK, Merck and Pfizer have multiple cash cows, GILD has 2, and they both are past their peak.

It's as if the market refuses to value the business at anything more than the years left before generics attack.

# Dividends
Gilead Sciences, Inc. is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.86 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $1.76 per share. That is a 6% growth. The forecast dividend of $1.86 compares to a forecast EPS of $11.76.

Perhaps that doesn't look generous, but they did buy back $10bn of stock in 2015 and $5bn of stock in 2014. So management isn't shy to return cash to shareholders.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 4% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -2%. 

The management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers wasn't rosy

&gt; The factors contributing to this conclusion include lower HCV revenue per patient as a result of a mix shift towards more heavily discounted payer segment in the U.S. and continues with a lower net average price in Europe, a trend toward slowing patient starts in the U.S. commercial segment and some earlier launch markets of Europe, a continued gradual trend towards shorter duration and loss of some market share to competition.

There just isn't any good news coming, is there? Average pricing, patent expiry, budget cuts, increased competition. But wait...

at the end of 2015 GILD spent $755m to license a rheumatoid arthritis drug (Galapagos) with Phase 3 trials coming in 2016. And they paid $400m+ earnouts for Nimbus a liver treatment drug that's just out of Phase 1. 

But even if these drugs are hits... when will they be generating cashflows? 

So, do you buy the value trap and trust that Gilead's management will come good again? Or do you sit and watch the business stagnate for a year or two. If like me, you've zero medical knowledge, how do you make that call?

16-09-26,54kk9k,United Overseas Australia. Excellent Business trading below their assets.,"Disclamer: I own UOS

So I found a company called United Overseas Australia(UOS) listed on the ASX. It is a real estate developer operating in Malaysia and has been an excellent performer since listing in 1988, with a 19.4% compounded return over the period with Dividends Reinvested as their NTA has grown at a rate of 20% per year. 

The structure is a little complex as they own 64% of a listed property developer on the Malaysian exchange and about 40% of a REIT, as well as having cash and some properties on the parent companies balance sheet. The two guys who started the company, still run it and own the vast majority of the shares. 

The business has about $1 of assets when you combine their stakes in the listed firms and the cash and property on their balance sheet(they record lots of the property 'at cost' even when it is likely worth much more than what they paid decades ago for it). However even with this $1 of cold hard assets and their buffet like compounding of their NTA, the stock is trading at about 64c which is a massive discount to NTA for such a quality business and is about 5x Earnings. They have recently initiated a buy back program. 

Here is a report on them that I found useful: http://harnessam.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/united-overseas-australia-july-2015.pdf

How do stocks without dividends translate into value? Is the only significant value generated from stocks without dividends the voting power it gives? If yes, who regulates the ""voting""? How regular is it? What kind of decisions can be voted on? What about less regulated markets; who makes sure the votes are held? Who makes sure the votes have any effect?

16-09-26,54kwdl,Reddit Open Yale Course | Week 4 | Portfolio Diversification and Supporting Financial Institutions,"Hi everyone!

This week we touch upon the cornerstones of modern financial theory. We will, inter alia, be learning about the Capital Asset Pricing Model, the equity premium, and the role of leverage. 

###Study Materials
- [Watch](http://oyc.yale.edu/economics/econ-252-11/lecture-4) | YouTube Lecture: Week 4: Portfolio Diversification and Supporting Financial Institutions
- Read | Chapter 1 and 2 | Siegel, *Stocks for the Long Run* 
- Read | Chapter 12 | Fabozzi, *Foundations of Financial Markets*

*Stocks for the Long Run* is definitely the more accessible book of these two. If you feel overwhelmed by Chapter 12 of *Foundations of Financial Markets*, I suggest you carefully read Siegel first. 

Background articles that may be of interest given the subject matter (*by no means required*). 

- Markowitz, '[Portfolio Selection](http://www.math.ust.hk/~maykwok/courses/ma362/07F/markowitz_JF.pdf)' (1952) Vol 7(1) *The Journal of Finance* 77-91.
- Mehra and Prescott, '[The Equity Premium, A Puzzle](http://www.academicwebpages.com/preview/mehra/pdf/The%20Equity%20Premium%20A%20Puzzle.pdf)' (1985) 15 *Journal of Monetary Economics* 145-161.

Since it is getting a bit silent in these threads, I'm very interested in how you all are doing so far and whether you are still keeping up and enjoying this course! :) 

For requests, contributions, or anything related to the course - use this e-mail (yoc.reddit [at] gmail.com) or send me a PM.

(https://np.redd.it/4u4j3d)  (https://np.redd.it/52g40o)  (https://np.redd.it/4jtm8h) (My favorite)  MY DD  Sustol helps reduce the common side effects of nausea and vomiting. The current drug on the (CINV) is an injection but is limited to only 48 hours or less. Sustol could prevent nausea and vomiting for up to five days!  HTX-019 NDA filing is due 4Q of 2016.  HTX-011 is their 3rd and last drug in the pipeline. It is long acting local anesthetic for the prevention of post-operative pain and inflamation. This is going to replace opioids for post-op if it is successful. The market as of 2016 that would require this drug would be 27.8 million people. So far the route of administration did no impact efficacy. Which could also broaden its use. Think on site assistance in the future such as broken bones and what not.  Financials:  Entered into a loan agreement for up to $100M in August 2016. (https://biz.yahoo.com/e/160810/hrtx8-k.html)  Short float 30.07%   Market cap of ~675 million  Still Pre-Revenue  ~Earnings date of 11/4/2016 Read somewhere that Sustol was hitting market Q4? Can someone source?  My thoughts:  • So basically the short float is pretty juicy if this stock posts a solid earnings once Sustol gets a full quarter on the market.  • They aren’t going anywhere any time soon.  • Low daily volume=plenty of times to buy the dip.  • It often retraces to the high $19’s or low $20’s so if you are patient you can swing trade over a few weeks for profit.  • $CPXX a similar valued stock in my opinion was bought out at $1.5 billion. With HTX-011 approval I see $HRTX getting at least that if not closer to $2 billion.  • Put your money into $HRTX and not let it waste away at your shitty biotech yolos.  TLDR: Swing trade and hold for a few weeks or buy for the long-term hoping for buyout. Solid news will cause a short squeeze and this thing will fly faster than you can hop on. Recommend at least throwing a few hundred at it to track at the least. Edit: Formatting,36

16-09-27,54s7k6,"It's time to let my DD go out into the world. $AQMS will moon or she will die-lute.","The company is a total game changer for the lead acid battery market, which as you know is in every vehicle and very effective for power banks. AquaMetals developed lead refining technology that uses electricity rather than smelting, cutting the breakeven plant load in half or better, on top of reducing the regulatory permitting costs. Simply put, this technology will be putting smelters out of business, and it will make America great again. Smelters pollute *a lot* and obviously US plants that care to follow the law can't stay in business when certain Asian companies just shit on their peasants. 

It's useful to point out that lead is 99% recycled. It's actually cheaper to recycle than mining ore. When your car battery dies it gets crushed and refined to make new batteries. Lithium can't say the same. 

AquaMetals is an American company based in California, and they're **nearing production start** at a brand new refinery out in the desert near the Tesla Gigafactory. Directly across the street from their new refinery is a warehouse full of batteries ready for recycling from one of their business partners. AquaMetals claims their final lead product is actually superior to smelting, and aim to charge a premium for their quality ingots and partner specified alloys. 

The best part, their partners. Ever heard of Interstate Batteries? They're do huge volume, and they own a big stake in AquaMetals. They have warrants for $AQMS at $9 and I believe $7 as well. The warrants at $9 were the reason for the fall from it's ATH. As you can see, it's been floating around $9 but is currently at a ""discount."" As for ""target"" price, I honestly think if any one of the following catalysts occur, this could easily break ATH within the next two quarters. At this point beyond that is speculation, but they're aiming for a small but significant portion of a multi billion dollar market lead market. I think it's fair to say the sky is the limit with current market cap at $135M. 

**The Catalysts:** The first catalyst is anything on [this timeline.](https://i.sli.mg/kdSOUh.png) Production is to begin in early October, and by year end 80 tons lead... I believe that's per day but I'll double check that. The second catalyst is even better than the best part. Companies across the world are lining up to buy AquaMetals refining modules. They intend to protect their IP in making deals with international partners, which literally could be announced at any time and mean buku bucks. The third catalyst of course is they're already planning to use non-diluting financing for a second facility in the US, the location could be announced at any time. 

Other stuff: CEO sounds British and is definitely smarter than you. They specifically said they are not interested in further dilution of shares. Company has been hiring like crazy for all the production shifts. For more DD just look up user Cranboor08 on stocktwats and read the articles he's shared I shit you not there's good stuff on stocktwats too. The Sylva capital interview with the CEO is really informative, probably the best DD. There's good articles on seeking alpha as well. I own [this many.](https://i.sli.mg/G5lnCh.png). If this makes hssa money he owes me a pizza. The reason this is down today is obviously because this is a company that will MAGA, so the debate performance is weighing it down to a major technical decision point. Up or down, yolo to find out. At this price, I'm strongly considering picking up a few more. 

edit: Bought 23 shares at 8.60 but it's in my RH churn account so I won't hold them very long. The 958 isn't going anywhere. ",44

I'm new to investing and have a couple thousand dollars to throw into the stock market. My goal, right now, is to use this money to learn by becoming emotionally invested in watching my money work for me.

After opening an account with TD Ameritrade a few years ago, I re-activated it and now use it as my primary broker/news outlet. I find the interface to be one of the best ones out there, and the customer service is great. 

I also made an account with Robinhood and plan to use it regularly to get a feel for my actions. I'm not planning to invest much, so the $0 commission fee is what sold me. 

Currently, I'm using StocksTracker on my iPad and have both accounts linked to it. It really does help me tremendously by organizing my accounts into one user friendly interface. It's also helping me learn much of the terminology.

I am a 23 year old med student with no business background, and no significant expenses. I currently own a small online company which helps me pay my tuition and allows me to have some surplus to invest. The reason I'm posting here is to see if anyone else has or has had a similar setup, and if there is any advice you could give. My main goal right now is to read as much as I can and learn from the money I am investing so that I can invest larger amounts when I am salaried. ",1

16-09-27,54sipc,How to beat the market.,"Everyone knows the market is rigged, but I think I've figured out a way to beat it. 


First off, you need to change your career. If you're fortunate enough to not be living off chicken tendies in your mom's basement, you are either gainfully employed,
or have some crappy job in retail. Either way you need to adjust your shit. For the former, you will have to downgrade your career, and for the later you are probably SOL either way so maybe stop reading now. 


Now you need to become a teacher. But not just any teacher. You need to get into a nice Manhattan private school at around grades 5 through 8. Now once you're teaching these little
rich shits Social Studies or what have you, you introduce the ""stock market"" game. We've all heard of it or done it when we were kids in school. You give the kids paper trading accounts, and whoever has the most money after a few months, wins.


Now the catch is that all these little fuckers have hedge fund mommy and daddys that will be giving them sick stock tips so they win the candy jar at the end of the game. Now you take these stock tips from your students and fully leverage that shit on options with your measly teaching salary.

And that is how you beat the market. ",2228

Did a fairly detailed model on a large-cap pharmaceutical company called Abbvie (ticker: ABBV). They were spun out of Abbott Labs and represent that company’s historical pharmaceutical drug research. I ran a somewhat straightforward model, analyzing the expected revenue from each of their drugs (as well as their drug pipeline). The majority of their revenue over the last few years (50.0% – 60.0%) is derived from a drug called Humira historically, which has had an unbelievable run and is still at least one or two years away from peak revenue, even as competitors get approved (I believe today Amgen’s alternative got the green light, but it will be years until Humira is really seriously threatened). 

Their pipeline is very robust as well, largely owing to their purchases of Pharmacyclics (Imbruvica and Venetoclax) and Stemcentrx (primarily Rova-T, with a few other early stage guys). These drugs mainly treat several hard-to-crack cancer conditions like SCLC and CLL. They also have a breast cancer drug which I think came from Stemcentrx. These guys have all passed or will soon announce Phase II or II trials; Rova-T will be on the market by 2018. Imbruvica could reasonably hit around $7bn in peak sales especially if Venetoclax (ancillary drug) is approved in a similar timeline. Rova-T is probably around $4bn or $5bn at max. The way I projected out these drugs was to do a “haircut” where I took expected revenue off of peak and multiplied it by the expected chance of approval. You can also look at it from an absolute revenue perspective where the full expected revenue of the drug goes through, and turn certain drugs “on” or “off”. 

Abbvie has a lot of debt compared to their total cap but it’s not that bad when you view it from a cash flow perspective; they probably cannot make any really large acquisitions in a 1 ½ to 2 year period, however. The debt can be paid off at a reasonable rate even with a large cash bank on hand. 

I would recommend exploring the assumptions I made and ask specifically if you are interested in why I chose X number for Y input. When I could I used research consensus, or company estimates from Abbvie. Also there is a pretty detailed pipeline announcement timeline on the 3rd tab that I would also look at.

Overall a DCF valued the company at a roughly 10% premium, suggesting there is a decent amount of short-term upside. In the longer-term Abbvie will have to convert its cancer pipeline into cancer revenue to avoid being too dependent on Humira, which has a rather short amount of time remaining in such strength.

16-09-26,54mh83,[Serious] How do you maximize profits on a big gainer like ARRY today?,"So I was in ARRY for 1K shares originally bought at 3.78. Needless to say, I don't have a *case of the Mondays* today. But here's the deal: 

* I live on the west coast and I'm too lazy to get up when the market opens

* I have children to feed and get off to school, a commute, and a real job where I have to write code all day

* Give the above, I can't really sit and stare at ARRY's chart all day with my dong in my hand 

**So, this morning** in TDA I set a 5% trailing stop loss when ARRY was in the high 5s. This amounted to about a 27¢ stop loss. It was triggered soon after and my shares were sold at 5.565. 

Let me be clear, I'm very happy with my 47% gains. But I feel I left a little bit of money on the table (ARRY has now been over 6 since 1:50pm eastern).

16-09-27,54qh4o,"How about a weekly ""upcoming catalyst"" thread","Something someone said on here has really proven true in my eyes over time. It was about the sub in general and why it seems like WSB in general always loses.  
What they said was that it's not that WSB comes up with bad tickers, it's not that WSB is WRONG, but it's that WSB is LATE.  
I feel like a weekly thread that outlined the week's upcoming catalyst would be beneficial to us all. It could outline any catalyst that the users feel would benefit, whether it be an upcoming FOMC meeting reminder, OPEC meeting, biopharm deadline, or a nice volatility play (like a debate). This would be a consolidated thread where everybody can argue the direction under whatever comment, and would be one place where we can go to specifically see upcoming catalyst.  
My vote would be for this thread to occur on thursday evenings, that way we would still have the opportunity all of friday to wait for any good entry points into whichever tickers we're interested in.

My question is, in the long run, how do these wind up working for the investor? Basically, let's say 10 years from now I was looking to use these as a supplemental income of $1000.00 per month. 

I'm trying to see how - or if - compounding interest principles apply to mutual funds. Let's say I invest $1000 per month during those 10 years, other than market returns which could be positive one year, negative next, etc, etc...how does it grow?

I know this probably seems like an extremely basic question, and possible something I should have looked into before investing, but I figure why not start and then figure it out.

A big and growing field which is the reason we are seeing LNKD and TWTR acquisitions, as well as MSFT, Goog, CRM, and ORCL entering the space and buying the small leaders.

Netsuite was offered 109 a share a few months ago by Oracle.  Ellison has a majority stake in both companies.

The BO was suppose to be tendered on the 30th of this month, but it was pushed back till October 6th..  T Rowe, the majority shareholder outside ownership, announced they would not tender shares 2-3 weeks ago.  They said they wanted a higher price, and it was bad faith to just accept the offer because Ellison runs both.  Accusations of a 'crooked deal' where N was not paid what it is really worth.

Anyways Ellison doesn't get to vote in the tender process.  T Rowe can impact the deal and maybe even stop it if others are on board.  

After the news the stock popped from its almost 109 levels to 110.  It has come back since, but today it is popping again.  Highest one day gain I have seen since the news.  They have till the 6th.  Is an increased offer from 112-120 going to be made?

1700 oct 110 calls bought by someone today.

I bought 10 Jan 110s when I first heard for 1.20. sold half for 2. Have half remaining.

Not telling ya'll what to do this is very binary.  It could be $1 more, it could be no increase, deal could fall through.  Just want to see what thoughts are and if anyone has ever seen this before with T Rowe or another fund holding up a deal like this.",1

It got up to about the $3.50 range, but in April of this year, there was some sort of class action lawsuit against the company for misleading shareholders on how much money they were making. In a couple of days the stock plummeted to $0.66 cents and was frozen. 

It's been frozen for about 6 months and I've been trying to Google for information over the last couple of months and just haven't found any information. I'd rather not sell it (not sure I even can) at such a loss, but I'm not sure what's going on and when I can expect something to happen with this stock. Any information would be helpful.",0
16-09-27,54qy6y,Opioid epidemic - A long-term case for $AMPH?,"Edit: Removed error, Narcan is not made by AMPH, thank you /u/12inchesoffreedom

Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, to save you the Google search, is a company that sells naloxone. It is used in emergency situations to prevent opioid overdoses. (This isn't their only product, but this is what I'm focusing on here.)

Both Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump have agreed that the opioid epidemic in the United States needs better resolution, fast. 

This issue enjoys bipartisan support, and both candidates have agreed that big-time cash has to be piled into this problem. 

Hilary Clinton wants a 10 billion(!) dollar plan enacted to fight drug abuse, while Trump hasn't given figures but admitted that we will need to ""spend the money"" to fix this issue.

Or so they say. A lot of the recent push in fighting this epidemic seems to be treating the symptoms rather than the disease, as more and more people are being given naloxone to administer in emergency situations.

People have openly complained that in many situations, naloxone is being used on individuals who then go right back to opioid abuse, due to the lack of a support network to help them kick their habit.

They then often need another dose of at a future date, in order to stave off another overdose.

Meanwhile, police forces have complained they need a ""budget"" just for naloxone.

$AMPH seems to be benefiting nicely. Quote: ""In 2015, naloxone sales accounted for $38.6 million of the company’s $251.5 million in annual revenue, but was its fastest-growing segment with increased volume and higher average prices."" This year, the stock has nearly doubled from February lows.

AMPH is not the only company selling naloxone, but it seems to be the most prominent, and they have struck several deals with states to supply naxolone in exchange for price rebates.

Overall, I think there is a strong case that $AMPH may benefit heavily from a national plan to fight the opioid epidemic, from either candidate, given that these plans seem intent on funneling cash to states, and $AMPH is already working with these very states on the issue.

16-09-28,54y1am,[DD] Aurora Cannabis: Why I bought 3k worth of Aurora Cannabis today and why you should too.,"[Proof](http://imgur.com/a/58HP2)

Dear wsb

Two months ago I told you fgts to buy Aphria at 2.30. Now it's at 3.47. I believe Aphria to still be a great company, a huge company, tremendous company but it's a tad overbought for you noobies to get in. You can still buy it if you want


So I offer you this: **Aurora Cannabis**. It's a company in Alberta growing cannabis in some **high tech future facility**. Here's some advantages Aurora has.


Pros:


-&gt;From my knowledge, it's the furthest west licensed producer in canada: meaning it does it's marketing to BC residents. BC residents smoke lots of pot. **It sponsored some event recently, meaning it's getting publicity.**


-&gt;it doesn't irradiate its cannabis. **hippies don't like radiation**. I know this because I cruise message boards and the hippies always complain how canopy growth corp irradiates its weed. 


-&gt;it's got some fancy way of cloning cannabis that makes it faster to grow than ever. This only matters a bit but whatever.


-&gt;it's growing faster than Aphria but has a smaller market cap because it's new. **It's market caps around 150million, aphrias market cap is 300million. canopy growth corps market cap is like 450million.**


-&gt;it's website is sexy and offers **free shipping** in canada.

-&gt; **same day to next day delivery**

-&gt;it's the first company to create a **fucking PHONE APP to order cannabis vs delivery and the app has been approved by health canada. TREMENDOUS**

-&gt; **4.5/5** rating on this rating website for bud quality https://lift.co/producers/aurora


-&gt;its customer base has grown tremendously

Cons:

**the names it chooses for its brand of cannabis are kinda lame.** Sundance? Maybe some hippies want that but I don't want some gay hippy shit names. Instead of keeping the name Pineapple Express, it renamed it Pierre Elliot, for our late prime minister.



**TL;DR**

This **anal**yst rates aurora cannabis with a buy and a hopeful one price target of 3$. My realistic price target for one year is 2.25$.

The ticker is $ACBFF

16-09-28,54w030,"Double Your Money in 60 Day or Ban, DD Inside","A couple months ago Yirendai's (YRD) market cap halved on the auspices of regulations from the Chinese Gov in the fintech area of P2P lending. The regulations, in the eyes of investors, took a hammer to the whole industry.  It didn't help that one of Yirendai's largest competitor last year closed up shop, and upon investigation, it turned out to be a complete ponzi scheme further legitimizing investor fears that the industry at large warrants stringent regulatory controls. 

My original thesis was that the regulations were there to sweep up the street, not drop a fuckin hammer down on the whole industry.  The market overreacted almost as if the company itself was under investigation--ironically now it's under a few of those KANG &amp; KANG LLP class action bullshit law suits.

So this is the kicker: the company, as one of the giants in the developing Chinese industry, has been recently inducted to IFIISP, which is a product of the Chinese Internet Finance Association designed to track all sorts of data regarding credit and other risk controls--data that is incredibly useful when gauging borrowing reliability and risk.  This is also a big leap in shutting down the notion that Yirendai has not been aware of the regulations just passed, and has been virtually unaffected.  I see a retrace to high 30s pre q3, and a complete beat at q3.  Once it beats, it will be off to 50 or so next quarter.  Make some money, faggots.

While this is in response to a [current popular post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/54qh4o/how_about_a_weekly_upcoming_catalyst_thread/), I feel the timing for this going forward should be at 6pm-ish on Sundays when futures begin trading.  Although maybe having this out Friday morning each week is a better idea so trades can be made in anticipation for the following week? Please feel free to pass along any comments, suggestions, or ridicule on my style and format.  

In addition to my own thoughts or comments I encourage participation to build on the following information and *maybe* benefit the community.  I really don't feel like spoon feeding all of this shit to everyone so you will have to do your own research.  Most importantly **DO NOT** use the information provided to make investment decisions without additional due diligence of your own.

**Earnings:**

Someone already puts up the calendar when each earnings season gets kicked off, but I'll provide some direct links to resources as well as popular tickers for the week.




Date | Ticker | When| Comment
---|---|----|----
9/27/16 | NKE | AMC | A strong performer for 3 years before a sideways 2016, can Nike beat and raise guidance enough for a move north or is there no gas left in the tank?
9/27/16 | CTAS | AMC | A renter of uniforms, will CTAS continue it's rise or will an unlikely miss tank the stock after hours?
9/28/16 | BBRY | BMO| Can  the formerly popular phone brand pull some good numbers out of its ass, will they instead post disastrous results, or maybe a continued slow bleed into what some say is an inevitable bankruptcy?
9/28/16 | PAYX | BMO| After a strong guidance raise last quarter, Paychex is still flying under the popularity radar and might provide an opportunity for low IV option plays either direction.
9/29/16 | COST | AMC| Technically oversold, will wholeseller Costco post good enough earnings to get PPS back near all time highs or will a strong USD headwind prevent reliably strong guidance?

**Economic Calendar:**



Date | Event| Time| Comments / Implications
---|---|----|----
9/28/16| Durable Goods Orders| 8:30:00 AM| Durable goods orders reflect the new orders placed with domestic manufacturers for immediate and future delivery of factory hard goods.
9/28/16| Janet Yellen Speaks| 10:00 AM| While not listed as a market moving event, any time this woman opens her mouth the market goes crazy.  Tune in for December rate hike implications as we get closer to the cartoonish US Presidential Elections.
9/28/16| EIA Petroleum Status| 10:30 AM| The Energy Information Administration (EIA) provides weekly information on petroleum inventories in the U.S., whether produced here or abroad. The level of inventories helps determine prices for petroleum products. If you're retarded, addicted to gambling, or both, this is the report you watch for and play either DWTI or UWTI.
9/29/16| GDP| 8:30AM | Per my shitty macro econ professor ""the sum of the of all  goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time.""  This number is like pressing your finger on the pulse of the US economy.  Like most economic indicators, market reaction to this number can vary.  You'd think a strong economy would be a good thing, but when institutions are depending on cheap money and low interest rates strong GDP numbers can be perceived as a reason to hike which typically results in beat up stocks and commodities... much like your mom's pussy haha lol.
9/29/16| International Trade in Goods| 8:30 AM| TLDR: Trade deficit numbers.  Indicator of demand domestic and abroad.
9/29/16| Jobless Claims | 8:30 AM| The count of unfortunate chumps who are filing for unemployment for the first time.  Market reaction will waffle depending on how far outside the consensus this number gets and whether or not it has implications for rate hikes and/or economic strength or weakness.

**FDA Catalyst Calendar:**

I used to find the allure of FDA catalyst quite boner inducing, but with the market at all time highs and HRC tossing her political weight around to tank biotechs while ransoming them for campaign donations, I fell out of love with this sector.  Lots of you fags enjoy $LABD or $LABU ALMOST as much as you like sucking cock.  While those instruments are better to play biotech industry as a whole, this calendar points out opportunities for individual companies both large and small.  I hope this contributes the most to WSB discussions moving forward, but I need some help because IDKWTF I'm doing TBH, Fam.  To further complicate things, this calendar shows when trial announcements happen BY APPROXIMATELY.  They are often not exact dates and times of when to expect news.



Date| Ticker| Stage| Half Assed Catalyst Explanation &amp; Comment
---|---|----|----
9/27/16| ATNM| Phase 2| Update on Leukemia drug.  Penny stock and volatile.  Who's ready to dive in without any further research?
9/30/16| DPRX| Phase 3| Foot ulcers related to the beetus.  Doesn't sound very exciting, however a wise WSB-er once said for a company to get to Phase 3 means the testing has gone very well up until this point.  Good news might be priced in and then again it might not?  Surprisingly bad Phase 3 data can wreck a stock like I wrecked your Mom's butthole last night.  Just look at $BMY recently.
9/30/16| GNCA| Phase 2| Genital Herpes.  Efficacy data regarding a drug I'm sure a lot of you could probably use right? HAHAHAHA.
9/30/16| SCYX| Phase 2| SCYX has two different drugs with data already released, but the date is indicating full report release due around this time.  Only including it because one is for something involving vaginas and you all are a bunch of fucking pussies so it's relevant.
9/30/16| THLD| Phase 2| Like SCYX, THLD also releasing preliminary data on two different cancer drugs.  Probably the juiciest play since THLD has definitely been pumped on WSB and the stock is beginning to recover from a brutal rape in late 2015.

When AMD was 2 dollars and I said buy.. the serfs laughed at me... 

Currently 6.57 that is 329% gains in less than a year... The rich get richer and the WSBetas stay poor...

3 months ago I took a break from banging supermodels to return to this slum and once again impart my wisdom upon the plebians..

https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/4piegf/why_i_ddplz_master_investor_and_predictor_of/

I said buy CGC at 2.75.... Again they scoffed... CGC is now 4.07 a share... 47% gains in 3 months...

Between the Forbes interviews and celebrity studded events, I still make time to do some analysis on what the next big stocks are to buy. After years of research and analysis I have come to a singular conclusion.....

#ALL IN CGC.TO

#ALL IN APH.V

#FOUR FUCKING TWENTY BLAZE IT *FAGGOT*

IF YOU DONT BUY CGC.TO OR APH.V YOU ARE A FUCKING COWARD WHO IS DOOMED TO A LIFE OF POVERTY I HAVE 75% OF MY ENTIRE PORFOLIO IN THESE TWO STOCKS EAT SHIT.

APH.V : Let's talk about this dank ass Canadian weed stock. 

First off, its not even on the tsx yet, its venture capitalist shit so you know it yolo. I'm up 45% off my initial buy and I don't think it's slowing down any time soon. Yeah I'm buying more and so should you. This will hit 10bux in a few years, especially when trump bans American weed production and the world turns to Canada to get their chronic.


CGC.to. the OG weed stock, already made a couple stacks off this and more are on their way, see my previous thread for more info, I bougt at 2.75 and I'm still buying at 4.07. again I expect 10 dollars from this.

Don't miss the train folks. Fags said they missed the AMD train when it hit 3 dollars, then again at 4, and 5.. then they bought at 8 and got rekt . There's still room for you chumps.

Invest in Canadian weed, its the future.

# Description
LendingTree operates an online loan marketplace for consumers. The Company's online marketplace provides consumers with access to product offerings from various lenders, which it refers to as Network Lenders, including mortgage loans, home equity, reverse mortgage, auto loans, credit cards, personal loans, student loans and small business loans, and other related offerings. 

So it's really just a product comparison tool.

## Recent financials 

The growth's been good both top and bottom line. Plus they've jettisoned the ugly mortgage origination business and now just focus on providing a comparison tool for consumers.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $254m | $167m | $139m | $77m | $55m|
|EPS | $3.83 | $0.84 | $0.36 | $4.36 | -$5.73|

## Competition

Perhaps it's too hard to make a list of competitors. People can get to a credit card or new mortgage directly, follow a click on google, and never go via Lendingtree. So even though the business model is very different, firms like Ally and DFS are competing for the end consumers attention. If effect, it's just a matter of who's got the best mouse trap?

That aside, looking at the margins and returns, what stands out for me is that they have a margin / return, versus ""(ex-)darlings"" like LC and ZG not.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Lendingtree Inc | $337M | 14% | 35%
Synchrony Financial | $13,936M | 30% | 17%
Discover Financial Services | $8,243M | 56% | 21%
Ally Financial Inc | $8,404M | 71% | -ve
LendingClub Corp | $1,169M | -ve | -ve
Green Dot Corporation | $699M | 14% | 5%
Zillow Group Inc | $741M | -ve | -ve
Bankrate Inc | $384M | 17% | -ve

## Cash / Debt?

Lendingtree Inc has $159M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 14% of the market value of Lendingtree Inc. Now if they wanted to consolidate the comparison market, they have the ability to do some small deals, I suspect.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $129.91 for Lendingtree Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Strong_buy_. That implies an upside of 39% to their target.

Strong Buy? Now that's the first one of these on r/stockaday!

# Valuation

But this is where I am puzzled...it's a Strong Buy on 28x earnings, with little visibility on growth. Is the ""I'm not an originator"" so much better? Why they get 28x versus BankRate getting 15x earnings.

# Dividends

Lendingtree Inc is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. And given the growth, that doesn't bother me.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 10% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 7%.

So how would a changing interest environment impact them. Here what the management team said on the latest call with Wall Street brokers.

&gt; The way I would think about mortgage is what basically happens as rates fall, volume floods in and at the same time, lenders cut back. So that's why we've been able to survive the mortgage industry declining and basically at the end of the day, it really comes down to share and we're facilitating a couple points to share in the mortgage business. 

Then talking about rising rates

&gt; And as rates rise, we would expect to see more lender demand, higher revenue per lead, our cost per lead goes up, and we should be in a relatively similar place.

So doesn't look like there's anything to worry about there, if management are correct.

Instead, this is a business that's gaining share... mortgage related revenue up 50%, other revenue up over 100%, with the mortgage origination industry up 4%.

Management keep rolling out improvements to their mouse-trap, to their user experience... so it looks like there's still a lot of room to grow... but is there a sufficient ""moat"" to justify 28x?

ESPR is currently trading $13.90 and has phase 2 topline data due  Q3 September 2016. This one I'm leaning more towards since trading options are more of a possibility.

VRTX is currently trading $88.07 and has PDFUA Sep. 30th. This stock would move more, but I'm not sure how much based on the catalyst being PDFUA. The drawback to this is that options aren't traded much for this company. 

So should I just focus more on ESPR or just look for a whole diffrent play? Also what on bio calendar list that is upcoming that stands out to you or something you are watching out for?

16-09-28,54wob0,Fidelity 401k investment choices.,"I have a 401k that matches 1.50 to my dollar up to 8% so I naturally put in 8% of my salary every year.  Been doing this for 5 years so compared to others at my pay rate I think I have a pretty decent retirement account.  I am 31 years old unmarried.

I mostly have been setting it to the Fidelity retire at x years account and then a smaller percent of money in tech and developing markets.  

I am a novice, and do not believe I can time the market but I really don't see the market continuing to go up at this point and am fine just taking the 1.50 match from the employer at this time. 

Is moving my investments to a bond option the safest way to keep my 401k out of the stock market ?  I see a Mellon Bond option for Fidelity.

0. Research items that might be profitable. 

1. Import items from China. 

2. Sell on Amazon for a profit. 


From what I've read. 

- You shouldn't choose a product that has too many ratings (1000+ reviews on the best sellers list dominated by 9+ people) as its way too competitive. 

- You shouldn't choose a product that has too few ratings (top sellers have 1-10 reviews) as you won't be able to sell anything. 

- choosing a niche product is usually a good idea. 




 
I have a few products in mind. But other than that is there any way to tell if an item has potential to sell well? 

Should I try to order from aliexpress first, see if the item will sell well and then if it does start using alibaba?

What about useful software designed specifically for online arbitrage? (Use data to predict which items have potential instead of just using my intuition). 

What about subreddits or forums that are specific for trying to make a profit off of Amazon arbitrage?

Lastly what do you guys think about retail arbitrage? For example using an app to scan which items from retail stores have potential to turn a profit on Amazon?

Thanks.

16-09-29,54zvo9,Brands are Dead!,"What kind of Ads do you see on Facebook/Instagram?

Over the past few years Facebook has exploded with advertisements from upstart companies that offer monthly deliveries of consumer goods (think dollar shave club) or clothing and other consumer/household goods. They tend to specialize in one or two products and all claim to be of premium quality. The retail industry calls them called ""Direct to Consumer"" brands. Over the last few months I've been wondering if most of these ""boutique"" companies will burn through their cash and go out of business or if they are actually taking market share away from brand name retailers. I came across this article today: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-28/all-these-instagram-ads-help-explain-why-a-big-mattress-company-is-crashing-today

Companies like Facebook, Twitter, Amazon and Google are creating ever more effective ways to gauge advertising effectiveness and consumer engagement - which is great for both the advertisers and their customers - the upstart retailers. This results in an environment where it is easier than ever for new companies to reach their target audience and project sales to maximize their use of cash while minimizing lead time.

Branding was important in the pre-internet era as the consumer looked for products they could trust. Before the internet, news and information spread more slowly which was an advantage to companies that had built up a trusted brand. As the internet and targeted advertisements allows for new companies to gain credibility and reach their target audience more cheaply, quickly and effectively than ever before, it will be harder and harder for the big brands to justify their higher price points. This will lead to a reduction in margins and weaken the value of building a brand. New upstarts with no physical footprint and low costs will outperform.

Lululemon is a company that has started at an interesting time in this shift in retail. They hit the nail on the head succeeding in the retail environment through branding a lifestyle over a product branding to gain an edge - They preach ""Mindfulness"". I don't think it will last simply because of the speed at which new companies can match quality and beat on price.

Maybe I'm nuts, but this is how I see the future 10-15 years from now.

There are too many companies to name, but I think many of the high p/e brand name companies are in trouble. I'm especially bearish on the first two companies on the list and companies like them.

In order of my opinion from most to least affected companies:

1) VFC: (The North Face, Vans, Timberland, Kipling, Napapijri, Jansport, Reef, Smartwool, Eastpak, lucy, and Eagle Creek brands) Forward P/E 22

2) LB (L Brands - Victoria’s Secret, Pink, Bath &amp; Body Works, La Senza, Henri Bendel, C.O. Bigelow, White Barn Candle ): Forward P/E 17.3

3) GPS (Gap - Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Athleta, and Intermix brands.) Forward PE 12.43

4) KORS (Michael Kor's) Forward P/E 10

5) JWN (Nordstrom): Forward P/E 17.2

6) COH (Coach): Forward P/E 14.83

7) RL (Ralph Lauren): Forward P/E 16.63

8) LULU (LuluLemon): Forward P/E 25.3

9) UA (Under Armor): Forward P/E 50.49

10) NKE (Nike) Forward P/E 19.36


Not saying you can short them now, but I think this is a huge macro-trend in retail that is here. I wouldn't hold for the long term. Obviously people have picked up on this because most of these companies have been crushed recently. Making this connection with the trend I've seen in advertising solidifies the trend for me. The main counter argument to this thesis is that these companies under the right management could use their cash to minimize their physical footprint and succeed in online retailing, but it would be at a much slower rate than new companies can pop up.

I'd love to hear counterarguments because I see some of these companies going to zero in the next decade!

16-09-29,552ock,ELI5: Is there any technical significance to trading volume?,"On online forums, I see the phrase ""going up on strong volume"" as if the latter part of the sentence is significant.  Some technical analysts swear by volume as an indicator that the movement is ""emphatic"".

I don't see it that way.  Tell me how I'm wrong (or right).

1. For every trade, there are two sides.  Those who are buying think that the price will rise higher, and those who are selling don't think so.  The volume therefore cancels out bulls and bears.

2. If there is a lack of buy or sell interest, and the price crashes or spikes due to that, it stands to reason that LOW-VOLUME movements are more significant than HIGH-VOLUME movements.  In the first case, as an example, you want to buy but there are very few sellers.  That shows the market sentiment is bullish.

In my opinion, all that volume shows is either:

a. HFT players are playing in that stock.
b. There is a lot of day-trader interest or volatility play going on.
c. The stock is not very mature and people are buying and selling within days, as the market sentiment keeps shifting.

Can someone explain?",12
16-09-29,5501ro,Thoughts on $DPRX?,"I'm mainly looking to buy in next Monday, pretty much only if they don't release data this week.

They foresee a market of 300m-750m peak sales of Locilex (where they expect ~50% of market share).

Their drug, Locilex, a paste for diabetic foot ulcers, seems to have shown ""non-equivalency?"" against the standard of care almost 17 years ago. I guess the FDA didn't like the trial (and it passed only one of the two trials), so they issued a CRL and it was never picked up again.

However, what the FDA wanted was a placebo-controlled trial, which DPRX are doing right now. Seems like if it could somewhat match the standard of care 17 years ago, I would hope that it can beat a placebo.

Company has enough money to last until at least Q2 2017, if I read correctly.

I think this company has no idea how to keep a schedule (leading me to believe that they won't have data ready in the next 2 days), only has one drug in its pipeline, and seems to have an improved phase 3 trial compared to its predecessor.

TL:DR This company reminds me of $MSTX, so I feel like getting in.",0

So I rather sell these stocks and purchase more shares in companies I understand more and currently own. Now here they are listed below with the returns for the past year:


SAP - German software company (39% return)

SIEGY - German engineering company (30% return)

FIGY - Barclays BK PLC Barclays ETN + FI Enhanced Global High Yield (28% return)

FBGX - UBS AG London BRH FI Enhanced Large Cap Growth ETN Putable N (26% return)

16-09-29,553mpm,Value Investing vs. Passive Index Fund,"Hello,

I am a sophomore in college (shooting for a BCS degree) and I recently watched (in my little free time haha) the whole series of videos done by http://buffettsbooks.com/ that explain beginner, intermediate, and advanced techniques for investing in the stock and bond market. I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on the basic ideas now.

Here's some background, I had about 7k that I don't need for college that I invested August 2015 in a VIGRX (A vanguard mutual fund). Now I saw a pretty good 5% return on my money plus dividends which put me about at $7400 this year. I now have sold around $4200 of that mutual fund in Sept 2016 and am looking to do value investing (maybe not quite yet since the market seems a bit high).

Anyway, I have heard that just leaving it in an index fund is a great plan and makes decent returns, but I am willing to put in the time to evaluate companies and make individual investments. Now this seems very taboo because Vanguard Index funds seem to be the ""holy grail"", but what I am trying to understand is why? 

If I understand what I am doing and make defensive choices couldn't I increase my average returns from 6-8% to something like 10-12%? Does this not seem like a reasonable assumption? I guess I am asking: is there work I can put in to slightly increase my returns or will index funds always beat me?

Thank you ahead of time :)",1

# Description
NIKE, Inc. is engaged in the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. Its portfolio brands include the NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley and Converse. They've also done a pretty good job expanding their brand into the digital area, though more for branding than revenues.

## Recent financials 

Looking at the financials, could say: They Did It! And that's despite the strong dollar dampening the results in the year to May 2016.

|May-end|2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $32bn | $31bn | $28bn | $25bn | $23bn|
|EPS | $2.16 | $1.85 | $1.49 | $1.34 | $1.20|
|Dividend | $0.62 | $0.54 | $0.47 | $0.41 | $0.35|

## Competition

In their annual they compare themselves to: 

&gt; adidas, ASICS, Li Ning, lululemon athletica, Puma, V.F. Corporation and Under Armour

And they suggest investors compare their stock to:

&gt; The Dow Jones U.S. Footwear Index including Deckers Outdoor Corp., Wolverine World Wide, Inc., Skechers U.S.A., Inc. and Steven Madden, Ltd.
&gt; The Standard &amp; Poor’s Apparel, Accessories &amp; Luxury Goods Index consists of V.F. Corporation, Coach, Inc., Ralph Lauren Corporation, Under Armour, Inc. and Michael Kors Holdings

Their margin compares well. And their returns are impressive. Seems to indicate a well run machine! Only Michael Kors is an  outlier.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Nike Inc | $33,023M | 15% | 31%
Ralph Lauren Corp | $7,339M | 14% | 8%
VF Corp | $12,236M | 16% | 24%
Coach Inc | $4,492M | 17% | 18%
Under Armour Inc | $4,423M | 12% | 15%
Michael Kors Holdings Ltd | $4,714M | 28% | 42%
Lululemon Athletica inc. | $2,194M | 20% | 24%
Skechers USA Inc | $3,435M | 13% | 20%
Deckers Outdoor Corp | $1,836M | 11% | 13%
Wolverine World Wide, Inc. | $2,591M | 10% | 10%
Steven Madden, Ltd. | $1,412M | 14% | 17%

## Cash / Debt?

With $2,728M of net cash, equivalent of 3% of its market value, it's no wonder Nike's got a large share buyback program.

They used up their old $8bn authorisation earlier this year, and started into their new $12 billion authorisation! In the last quarter alone they bought $1bn of stock at an average price of $59.

&gt; We intend to use excess cash, future cash from operations and/or proceeds from debt to fund repurchases under the share repurchase program.

# Wall Street thinks?

So, it's no surprise that the professionals on Wall Street have a $63.77 for Nike Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 22% to their target.

# Valuation

Though that target would push the stock to an even greater premium that it's on today. UA and LULU are at higher levels and expected to grow faster, but at 22x we have to admit that NKE's priced as a ""High Quality"" stock.

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/nke/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
NKE | $87,520M | 22x | 13% | 1% | 5%

WWW | $2,240M | 16x | 13% | 1% | 8%
SHOO.O | $2,084M | 17x | N/A | 0% | 7%

# Dividends

Nike Inc is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.69 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $0.62 per share. That is a 11% growth. The forecast dividend of $0.69 compares to a forecast EPS of $2.38.

Again, no wonder there are big buybacks in the pipeline.

# Taxes

There have been some folks complaining about taxes recently. And it is fair to say that NKE's tax rates declined from 24% to 22% to 19% in the last 3 years. But just because the growth is outside the US, and they aren't re-patriating the cash, is that a reason to be a bear?

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -6% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -2%. So no real move there.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, this week

&gt; Our outlook for fiscal year '17 remains largely unchanged in terms of growth and the profitability of our business. Specifically, for the full year, our revenue expectations remain in line with prior guidance, high single digit reported revenue growth and high single to low double-digit currency neutral revenue growth. 

So it's steady as she goes, the dollar and economy willing!

# Governance

Last but not least, we need to think about the Founder Mr Knight. He controls the company via the Class A shares. 

&gt; As of June 30, 2016, Swoosh, LLC beneficially owned more than 78% of our Class A Common Stock. If, on June 30, 2016, all of these shares were converted into Class B Common Stock, the commensurate ownership percentage of our Class B Common Stock would be approximately 16%. 

Now it's highly unlikely that these shares will hit the market. I'm more concerned by the the existence of a dual class structure. It's just a thing that I hate! 

Though remember, the baton has passed.. 

&gt; Swoosh, LLC was formed by Philip H. Knight, our Chairman Emeritus, to hold the majority of his shares of Class A Common Stock. On June 30, 2016, Mr. Knight sold his voting interest in Swoosh, LLC to a trust controlled by his son and NIKE director, Travis Knight.

For now, like with FB and GOOGL, I'm not concerned, but it's a flag to keep a watch on Travis! 

In the meantime, let's focus on the cashflow... which is all looking good.

I'm not allowed to open an account with a firm if it's not locally registered with our country's SEC directly, so pretty much every company is out of the question, I either have to go with Saxo or move to Europe. I currently trade in a stock market where daily volume is ~$1.5 billion, so it's a little illiquid. (10 stocks get the $1.3 billion and the rest is shared among 350 stocks)

I'll start with $250K and I qualify for Saxo's active trader criteria.

For US stocks, they charge $6 flat fee if you buy less than 1000 shares and $0.007 per share if you buy more than 1000 once. This is already a good deal for me, but there's no harm trying to lower my costs.

This would work great while trading stocks like Apple and Cisco in huge quantities, but if I buy 300 shares of a $8 stock I'd be paying $6 for $2400 worth of trade. That's a lot in terms of percentages.

Saxo also charges 3.5% CFD financing fee for all markets while IB charges 1.9% for US (they charge A LOT LESS than 1.9% if your volume is big) and a lot less for some other markets, like EU countries. As far as I know, their costs are pretty much the same on this (don't they all borrow at the FED rates?), but it doesn't mean Saxo will get close to 1.9% if I push hard enough. Still...

Aurina Pharmaceuticals has finished their phase 2 study of their drug Voclosporin, which is used to treat Lupus Nephritis. This is the inflammation of the kidneys in Lupus patients. They held a webcast yesterday discussing the gist of their data, but are saving the details for a breakfast their holding tomorrow. They were very optimistic in the webcast and tomorrow's webcast at 8 AM should be a major catalyst for a price increase. You can find yesterday's webcast here
http://wsw.com/webcast/leerink27/auph/index.aspx

Now, here's why it's a good investment.
-Women are 9 times more likely to experience this than men, and right now corticosteroids are the best treatment. The treatments use of steroids is one of the worst parts for women. They have many negative side effects on women and in the study, the patients were able to be weened off steroids to an amount lower than what naturally occurs in the body.

-The current treatment only has a 10% complete remission rate and a 50% partial remission rate.

-The majority of deaths in the study were from 3 countries, Bangladesh, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka, where the patients were not receiving proper care at the hospitals. These 3 countries may be excluded in the phase 3 trial.

-The speaker stated that there should be no problems with the FDA moving forward. Also, the study involved 2000 people, an unusually high amount of patients with drug exposure in a phase 2 trial.

-The expected market in Japan is estimated to be $80 million, in Europe it is estimated to be $300 million+, and finally in the USA it's estimated to have a $1 billion market.

This is all I have for now, I advise you pay attention to tomorrow's webcast at 8 AM. As I write this AUPH is trading at $2.60 which seems way too low considering the news surrounding it. Do with this what you want, I personally bought 360 shares @ 2.53 avg because I'm a poorfag.

* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)
* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)
* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
* Any big debts?

Converged data center infrastructure provider Nutanix today announced that it has raised $237.9 million in its initial public offering, as a result of selling $14.87 million in shares at $16 per share. That’s up from $15 per share in the most recent revision to its initial public offering (IPO) filing from September 28 and up from $13 per share in a September 19 revision.

Nutanix is set to start trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol NTNX on September 30. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are the lead book-running managers in the deal, according to a statement.

Nutanix first filed paperwork for its IPO in December but held off on the proceedings for several months.

This is one of the bigger technology IPOs so far this year. Others that have gone out this year include Acacia Communications, Dell’s SecureWorks, Line, Talend, and Twilio.

Nutanix came up with a $168.4 million net loss on $444.9 million in revenue — mostly product, and the rest from support and services — in the year that ended on July 31. The company had 3,768 customers as of July 31, up from 782 two years prior to that. Customers include AT&amp;T, Airbus, Deloitte, Staples, and Yahoo. Based in San Jose, California, Nutanix had 1,980 employees on July 31.

Nutanix’s investors include Battery Ventures, Blumberg Capital, Fidelity, Khosla Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Morgan Stanley Expansion Capital, Riverwood Capital Partners, and Sapphire Ventures.",8

I'm also used to being able to short. I also like their wide range of products.  I want to have access to as much as possible and I prefer to have less accounts open everywhere for simplicity. 

White I am British, I may well have access to New Zealand or Australia via residency so I'm interested in that too. 

However... I believe if you hold for a long time with IB then rollover fees will probably eat into profits. Whats not clear to me is at what point would be better to use a traditional broker? 

I generally see myself holding a stock for 3  months at least, but maybe a year. I like to diversify so I probably would only buy $300-1000 at a time whenever I see something I want to support and can clearly see has a future. 
Typically when I want to invest is when I read about a new product or service and I think to myself 'great idea' - I then look it up. The thing is, that I then have to figure out how to invest in that idea... And I might not have access to that market. 

Buying and selling stock seems to cost minimum ~$10 a time so I guess holding $500 needs at least 6 months,  rule of thumb... To cover that. 

What do you find what's for you as a general guideline? 

Finally, I also need to think about the stock custodian is in terms of are they going to go bust...  Since we're last in line creditors But I know that is a lot further than most go in their due diligence.",2

&gt; But the Saudis have publicly proclaimed that ""We don't care if prices crash to 20 dollars a barrel"". That number isn't an accident - that matches history - the last time OPEC actually cut was in 1998 when prices hit 15 dollars a barrel. $15 in 1998 is roughly $21.80 in 2015. Things have to get incredibly, incredibly bad for OPEC to actually band together. And 20 dollars a barrel is where the Saudis probably stop making money - their production costs are estimated somewhere between 10-20 dollars a barrel (estimates vary). The simple truth is that Saudi Arabia can make plenty of money right now because their production costs are so low, and they don't want to lose volume or market share. They don't trust OPEC to keep with a cut because of their historical experience and the bad governance in many of their partners. So they keep pumping because there's nothing else to do.

16-09-30,559lc5,"The Litte Book that (Still) Beats the Market - Review, discussion, thoughts.","So, I had some money in my Google Play account from filling out their surveys and got the ebook of this book because it's short and cheap, the name popped up a few times here and I got curious. In other books, I have read Random Walk Down Wall Street, and Margin of Safety.

Initially, I was put off by the title, because it sounds like one of these scam books, where the true path to riches is to write books for suckers who want to get rich quick. 

Even worse, the investment approach described in the book is a **magic formula**. Can it get any more fishy?

But wait. It's all not so bad. What this book advocates is basically a simplified, light version of Value Investing. The ideas behind value investing appear to be reasonably sound (Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffet...) but the process of *properly* evaluating a business to figure out its fair value is *hard*.

The author thus offers a shortcut to value investing. Rather than sweating over all the minuscule details of 5 to 10 companies, screen for companies that are: Not tooooo small (&gt;$50 mil market cap), then rank them via a combined measure of whether they are a *cheap* company (low P/E) and whether they are a *good* company, which he defines as having a high Return on Assets. Armed with that list, buy 30 or so stocks ranked this way and hold them for a year. On *average*, this process should give you a decent list of value stocks. The number 30 (as opposed to 5-10) is important because for every single company you don't know if their P/E is low because they just *suck* or if their return on assets is high because they had a huge one-time sell-off, so sometimes your ""value"" stock is just a ""shit"" stock. 

So far his method (obviously I describe it very crudely). He provides impressive backtested results avoiding, from what I can tell, the typical backtest traps. 

What I *like* about this approach: There is absolutely no *forecasting* involved. The valuation is done based on past data, so you don't have to guess (which you wouldn't do correctly anyway) what you think the company will earn 10 years from now.

What I *dislike* is its willful blindness of the type of company. I figure that his formula can be a good starting point to identify companies worthy of a closer look, but feel that one should always put in some work to avoid value traps. One example: Gilead is high up on the list as it currently would be generated. But /r/stockaday did an awesome analysis on that one and made a good case for being at least a little bit cautious. 

I'd love to hear what the more knowledgeable folks in this subreddit think about this book, and about the method, at least as a starting point on the search for value investing opportunities. ",4

16-09-30,559pnj,"DJI Unveils New Mavic Drone, More Trouble for GPRO.","On September 19th GoPro announced its newest product the GoPro Karma. A new drone most notable for a size and form factor that allows users to more easily carry their drone to the destination where they intend to use it.

Other features are a gimbal system that can be removed from the Drone itself, a controller with an integrated screen, and the ability to use your existing or future GoPro(s) as the camera.

While not a mind blowing addition to the world of consumer drones the GoPro Karma seems / seemed like a solid first offering from GoPro. And I would argue it successfully targeted some new market segments (people who want to be able to easily bring their camera drone along for the ride). 

That being said at the time of the announcement GoPro already had some marks against it. Their transmission / tracking / sensing / and auto piloting features were inferior to **existing** products offered by their main competitor in this area DJI.

And on September 27th things got worse for GoPro.

DJI unveiled its newest drone, the Mavic. Which has quite handily pulled the rug out from GoPro's most notable feature. The Mavic is capable of being folded into a *significantly* smaller form factor than GoPro's offering. 

The only major advantage GoPro can tout over the DJI Mavic is the removable (and thus multi use) gimbal. But this feature that has already been offered by the DJI competitor Yuneec and hasn't won them a competitive edge over DJI.

In short I would say its bad news for GoPro that their most exciting new product has now been handily, and immediately countered. This is likely to take a big bite out of any Christmas sales they were expecting from their newest product.

Longer term it's becoming apparent that GPRO isn't adapting quickly enough to expand their market share and customer base. And one needs to question if they have the agility to prevent competitors from gradually eating away at their existing customers.",7

And on that front, there is good news. Yum! Brands announced on Monday that its board has approved the planned spinoff of its China unit. The company would distribute one share of Yum China common stock for each share of Yum! Brands common stock held at the close of business on October 19, 2016. Yum China will start trading as an independent company on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “YUMC” beginning November 1, 2016.""

As the conductor of this train, and with some input, I have decided that Thursday night or Friday morning is when I will be posting.  That way anyone using this information as a part of their own research will have time to plan for the week ahead.

**First, a recap from what went down earlier this week:**

I lost track of how many times I was told to both fuck and kill myself [so I tried an activity that included equal dedication to each](http://imgur.com/a/6CeZv) in an attempt to make everyone happy.  With this post as evidence, I am sad to report I was only able to achieve one of those things.  I awoke many hours later to my post being gilded twice, a confused dog, and an angry spouse.  Honey, if you’re reading, please come home.  The dishes are piling up and I’m out of clean hoodies.

For earnings, $NKE kind of shit the bed as I thought they would, but remember I will provide no trading advice to you idiots that can’t come up with an original thought of your own.  You gotta cross that bridge without Papa Cunt holding your hand.  While it wasn’t posted, and I can’t find anywhere saying 9/27/16 was their release date, mattress maker $TPX came out lowering expectations and got absolutely crushed in after-hours trading.  The executive vice president of Tempur rid himself of a sizable block of shares just days before the announcement.  While most insiders have a trading blackout time around earnings announcements, this faggot dumped his shares just before an unscheduled announcement so it is unlikely he will see any action from regulators.  Must be nice.  Maybe it will be worth having a tiny segment each week including irregular insider trades, but I am only one man.  My amount of time and shits to give are finite so keep your expectations low.  $CTAS had a strong reaction to a typical beat, but the market has pulled it back down.  About the same goes for $BBRY… what do they even sell any more?  $PAYX had a decent drop after setting expectations too high last quarter.  An indication of an economy entering recession as a payroll processor has to lower guidance?

Onto the economic calendar, the EIA report was mixed with OPEC stealing the show and tentatively agreeing to a November production cut.  Don’t hold your breath on that because just as I’m writing it appears [Iraq is throwing a temper tantrum about the deal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/iraq-quarrel-on-production-number-could-sink-opec-deal-1475168419).  Also [a good post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/554n02/the_opec_deal_will_not_survive/) raising points on wsb right now.  If there is a god he sure has a fucked up sense of humor putting oil underneath all those countries with their retard leaders and/or/also stupid religions.  GDP numbers were a big highlight this week with an impressive revision up from 1.1% to 1.4%.  On top of that, marked as a non-market moving event, [Jerome Powell ran his mouth saying the US economy is in “solid shape.”](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-powell-idUSKCN11Z21V?il=0)  What a fucking asshole.  That was a “good news is bad news” situation as investors fled equities, volatility spiked, and everyone soiled their undies at the thought of a .25% rate hike in December.

On the biotech side of things I truly hope none of you mouth breathers took the bullish side of those tickers.  Be it their awful results, just the market being down, or in the spectacular case of $THLD currently down 47% as I write, all of those companies got a proper fucking.  $THLD going the way of $BGMD with delisting eminent.  Inverse WSB for the win!

Before I get started on next week’s catalysts I want to say it was really cool hearing from all of you regardless of what you had to say.  If you insist on gilding a stickied mod post, knock yourself out.  However, in the case of this post, I ask you take that money earmarked for gold and instead send a pizza or some kind of gift card to whoever has the highest ranked comment behind the stickied post telling me to kill myself.  Highest commenter, whoever you are, post proof if it happens!  

**Earnings:**

Date | Ticker | When | Comment
---|---|----|----
10/4/16 | MU | AMC | Semiconductor company Micron Technology has had an impressive run from earlier lows.  Will investors be impressed with another quarter of negative earnings or will future guidance disappoint?  Implied volatility already looks high for options expiring next Friday.  Whether you’re long, short, or just watching, bring some popcorn.
10/4/16 | DRI | BMO | Be it their “look at me blowing cash like a person who matters” chain The Capital Grille, or trashy first date staple Red Lobster, can Darden break the sideways channel they’ve been in with a good report?  Or will their guidance fail to deliver much like that punk waiter at the Olive Garden who never brought me my second basket of “never ending” garlic bread sticks?
10/5/16 | YUM | AMC | Will Yum Brands, a conglomerate running diarrhea inducing fast food chains, have anything worth paying attention to this earnings?  With a mix of surprises and farts in past earnings releases this might be one better to move on AFTER earnings.  WTF do I know though, think for yourself.
10/5/16 | MON | BMO | Remember Bayer is trying to buy Monsanto so don’t be stupid.  Sell premium if you must, but don’t blame me if in addition to earnings they announce the buyout ain’t happening.
10/5/16 | AYI | BMO | I can’t include every ticker for these updates, but AYI looking like it’s due for a violent earnings move.  [Maybe?  Maybe not?](http://imgur.com/a/A5V7M)
10/6/16 | HELE | AMC | Helen of Troy is just one of many companies that sells shit you don’t need.  This sub was having a ball shorting retail stocks not too long ago and I’m of the belief major retailers are in for a bruising over the next 5 to 10 years.  Amazon has become a behemoth and opening your own online store to sell the exact same shit for less getting is easier and easier for the average Joe.  Are the all-time highs in the past for this stock or will a march north resume after the earnings release?

**Economic Calendar:**

Date | Event | Time | Comments / Implications
---|---|----|----
10/2/16 | Tankan Large Manufacturers Index Q3| 7:50 PM | Per a few comments, I’m stepping outside my knowledge and comfort zones to include some foreign economic data.  Japan has gone the route of negative interest rates so I’m sure a large manufacturing index will have an impact for global markets.  Maybe one of your smart lurkers that plays currencies can comment on what you think will happen.
10/3/16 | ISM Mfg Index | 10:00 AM | Getting lazy so per Bloomberg “The ISM manufacturing composite index indicates overall factory sector trends. The relevance of this indicator is enhanced by the fact that it is available very early in the month and is not subject to revision.”  A large miss on this might get investors thinking the rate hike won’t happen.  Pay attention and learn.
10/5/16 | EIA Petroleum Status Report| 10:30 AM | Grab your dicks, your DWTI, your UTWI, and see if the report this week along with questionable OPEC supply cut will impact your favorite fossil fuels.
10/6/16 | Jobless Claims | 8:30 AM | If you don’t know what this is stop being so fucking stupid.  Pay attention for really shitty or really good numbers to maybe get the market thinking 2016 will come and go without a rate hike.
10/7/16 | Employment Situation | 8:30 AM | Reported monthly, investors pay close attention to this economic indicator as a way to anticipate fed movements and judge the health of the labor market.  Surprises up and down have ended up with huge moves in the market, gold/silver, and currencies.  Everyone will be paying attention to this report while trying to figure out the Fed.
10/7/16 | Multiple Fed Speakers | Various | Stanley Fisher, Loretta Mester, Esther George, and Lael Brainard all speak on this day.  Do some research and determine whether these people are typically dovish, hawkish, or wafflers.  If you don’t know what that stuff means, figure it the fuck out before you continue losing money in your king of faggots Robinhood Gold account.  A good employment situation followed by a bunch of hawkish Fed speakers could see a real fun trading day to follow.  Place your bets the night before and buckle up.

I’m sure I’m missing a lot of shit, so instead of meme-ing hard in the comments add some value of your own.

I hope degenerates new and old can take something beneficial away from this.  If you’re a new subscriber from /r/all reading this, please try to not post your Robinhood screen shots too much.  They anger the mods who have fond memories of this sub before you joined.  Don’t blindly trade off of this information.  A good reminder of what can go wrong is looking at all the biotechs for this week that ate a dick ($THLD now down 63% now holy fuck).  If you’re a somewhat knowledgeable and successful yolo-er or that maybe you’re that smart lurker that never posts, I hope I’m able to help enhance your trading by reminding you of what is happening the week ahead.

Have a great weekend and see you for October 14th’s installment around this time next week.  [And don’t any of you ever forget… !](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JO7xviZc8x0)

16-09-29,5553s6,stockAday: a look abroad at $ABB,"# Key Stats for ABB Ltd (ADR)

Time for a trip abroad? To the exciting world of heavy industrials based out of Switzerland!

So warning, even though it's a $50bn value stock, it's an ADR so trades just $35m a day on the NYSE. 

|Ticker|[ABB](https://stockflare.com/stocks/abb)
|:---:|:---:|
Sector | Heavy Electrical Equipment
Latest price | $22.70
Value | $49,921M
Daily vol | $35M
Date | 29 September 2016

# Description
ABB is engaged in power and automation technologies. The Company manages its business based on five divisions: Discrete Automation and Motion, Low Voltage Products, Process Automation, Power Products and Power Systems. 

* For utilities companies there is a complete power &amp; automation offering for transmission and distribution. 
* Pure industrial companies / factories buy their energy efficient products, systems and services to reduce electricity consumption and they also deliver automation systems.
* The company provides power &amp; automation solutions for transport &amp; infrastructure customers. e.g. Railways.

## Recent financials 

Recent financials are not exciting. In fact quite the opposite. There's a distinct lack of growth or margin expansion.

And looking at the breakdown, it's not been great for any of the 5 divisions.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $35bn | $40bn | $42bn | $39bn | $38bn|
|Operating income | $3bn | $4bn | $4bn | $4bn | $5bn|
|EPS | $0.87 | $1.13 | $1.21 | $1.18 | $1.38|

## Competition

Looking at the competition, its the usual list of mega industrial companies: Eaton Corp, Emerson, Honeywell, Hyundai, Legrand, Mitsubishi, Metso Automation, Rockwell Automation, Schneider, Siemens, and even a few division of GE.

And comparing the business to the other mega industrials listed in the US, ABB is the poor old European cousin on margins and returns.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
ABB Ltd (ADR) | $34,341M | 14% | 12%
Rockwell Automation | $5,948M | 21% | 32%
Siemens AG (ADR) | $88,612M | 12% | 15%
Eaton Corporation PLC | $20,153M | 17% | 12%
Emerson Electric Co. | $20,581M | 18% | 22%
Honeywell International Inc. | $39,106M | 22% | 26%

## Cash / Debt?

The balance sheet's pretty conservative with $1,651M of net debt. That is 0.3x it's latest operating profit.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $20.90 for $ABB and their recommendation to clients is _Hold_. That implies a downside of -8% to their target.

# Valuation

And despite that ugly comparison on earnings, the stock's trading at a premium to all the others. So no wonder Wall Street aint a fan.

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/abb/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
ABB | $49,921M | 20x | 5% | 3% | 6%
ROK | $15,230M | 20x | 4% | 2% | 9%
SIEGY.PK | $99,171M | 15x | 9% | 4% | 12%

EMR | $33,908M | 18x | 7% | 4% | 11%
HON | $89,144M | 18x | 10% | 2% | 8%

# Dividends
ABB Ltd (ADR) is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.75 per share, which compares to a forecast EPS of $1.08. So, it's a pretty high payout ratio.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 14% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 5%. On a 1 year view the stocks up 30% even though earnings forecasts are flat.

And that's against a backdrop of sales off 6% in the 6 months to June. And income taking a dive as well.

At the 2Q results results, they spoke of all the efficiency gains they are working on. But in the near-term, they expressed caution: uncertainty in Europe; slowing China; stable US; negative impact from oil prices.

What next? Well there's the capital markets day for brokers on 4th Oct...

... but it's hard to see a short term boost. 

I suspect there are more interesting Industrial plays in the US.. to *Make Your Portfolio Great Again*. ;)

So I am setting myself up to buy some shares. I just need to set up a decent entry point. From the given momentum and market hysteria I am thinking an entry spread starting at 6.75 and dropping down to 4.25 should capture the bottom.

However, I've found that when it comes to technology or more obscure industries, the companies chosen as comps are not very precise - especially when this process is automated. Salesforce and Facebook are not similar businesses, but they're often shown to be. Tech and healthcare are the most pronounced of these because business models and products vary widely within these sectors but I'm sure it happens across the board.

Help me expand my entertainment and let me know where I can get ""Doom and Gloom"" economic news/talk that comes from credible sources. I don't want to hear people like Peter Schiff or Jim Willie. That's just not fun because it's so easy to see their bias.

Who knows of lots of entertainment(by my standards) that I can listen to? Here are examples of people I'm looking for:

Ray Dalio- Believes that we're at the end of a long-term debt cycle and has soft facial features compared to males his age. I can't figure out why

Carl Icahn- Obviously successful, and definitely entertaining with a strong dosage fear-mongering. 

Paul Singer- Not bullish on the economy. But more importantly his voice gets me angry which drains my energy so I can go to sleep about 20 minutes earlier.

16-09-30,557onx,Building Custom Stock Alerts in Google Spreadsheets,"Hey r/investing,  
&amp;nbsp;  
I used to be a risk analyst at UBS and currently work for a tech company.  My friend is an engineer and MBA also working in tech (ex-Microsoft).  
&amp;nbsp;  
We’re passionate about investing and teaching others about investing. Since we have technical backgrounds, we’re always trying to automate manual tasks.  This has been helpful when searching for and monitoring our investments.  
&amp;nbsp;  
So, we’ve been thinking of creating an online course to teach people how to save time and money by building their own custom stock alerts using Google Sheets. This is something we noticed is a common ask on Reddit.  Although there are great investing resources online, we have found them to be focused on investment theory. However, we haven’t come across much practical content on how to build tools to save investors time and money.  
&amp;nbsp;  
The course will be a *how to* guide for building a spreadsheet to create and manage email and/or SMS alerts for your stocks.  
**We will guide you through the entire process, including:**  
- spreadsheet setup  
- defining the alert logic  
- writing code to get the necessary market data  
- how to send email/sms alerts to yourself  
&amp;nbsp;  
**You’ll learn to create alerts to notify yourself when:**  
- Stock price moves more than $X, or X% from previous day close  
- Stock reaches your target price  
- Trading volume exceeds average daily volume by X%  
&amp;nbsp;  
**You’ll also learn to create reminders for things like:**  
- Ex-Dividend, or Dividend Payout dates  
- Earnings dates  
&amp;nbsp;  
So, we'd like to gauge the community on your interest in such a course.  
**1. Do you find the topics in our proposed syllabus useful?  What would you remove/add?**  
**2. At what price point would this course be way too expensive?  At what price would it be so cheap that it makes you question the course quality?**  
&amp;nbsp;  
Your answers will be very helpful in creating something that people want.  We really appreciate your taking the time to read this.  Feel free to PM me.  Thanks again!  
&amp;nbsp;  
[Edit] If you'd like me to set up a quick price alert for you via email, shoot me a PM and we can do it over the weekend.

They may not necessarily ""buy buy buy"" into strength today, but you can bet your ass they'll ""sell sell sell"" if things start to tank further.
