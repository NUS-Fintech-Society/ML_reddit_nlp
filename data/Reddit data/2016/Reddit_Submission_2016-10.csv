16-10-01,55axzv,Confused on Annuity Payment,"You are 22 years old. You currently have $5,000 you deposited into an investment account that is expected to provide an annual rate of return of 8.4%. However, you suspect (correctly) that the $5,000 by itself won't be enough to provide you with a reasonable standard of living when you retire in 43 years.

You decide that your first retirement withdraw ( in 43 years) should be $150,000. Subsequent withdraws will decrease in size by 1% per year. You've decided that the last withdraw will occur on your 99th birthday. TO save enough for retirement, you plan to make annual deposits into the investment. The first deposit will occur 8 years from today, and the last will occur on your 50th birthday. The size of these deposits will grow by 3% per year. The investment account always earns a rate of return of 8.4% per year, every year.

How money will you need to deposit into the investment 8 years from today?

I found the PV of the annuity of $150,000 to be $51,664.04. I then subtract from it $5,000. Then I find the future value of that at 7 years from today, and solve for the payment due at year 8. My question is why do I need to subtract $5,000.

Thanks for the help!",4

16-10-01,55b2zb,Could someone explain inverse ETF and how it has a risk compared to regular ETF?,"I'm looking at DOG vs DIA in particular. I saw for DOG, it says,

It's important to note that DOG is designed to deliver inverse results over a **single trading session**, with exposure resetting on a daily basis. Investors considering this ETF should understand how that nuance impacts the risk/return profile, and realize the potential for ""return erosion"" in volatile markets. DOG should definitely *not be found in a long-term, buy-and-hold portfolio*, but may be a useful tool for more active investors looking to either hedge existing exposure or bet on a decline in the U.S. large cap firms. Investors also have the option of simply selling short a traditional large cap ETF, though that strategy will generally involve greater potential losses than utilizing an inverse ETF.



Okay so I understand, that if an ETF goes through this scenario.
Rise 10%, fall 10%, this happens.

DIA: 100   110   99
DOG: 100  90  99

I understand how it makes a difference for inverse leveraged ETFs that there will be built in decay, but my question is, 

Is there a difference between the erosion of DOG vs DIA, or any ETF or stock for that matter? Don't they all have a holding period of 1 day and will reset technically?

Why shouldn't DOG be held more than that, but it's okay for DIA to be held long term (if we ignore the fact that market generally is going up, but just in terms of erosion, but lets just say we can't predict the future)

Well, this is because the company has planned to return $6.2 billion of capital to shareholders (not including dividends) related to the separation of its China business.
And on that front, there is good news. Yum! Brands announced on Monday that its board has approved the planned spinoff of its China unit. The company would distribute one share of Yum China common stock for each share of Yum! Brands common stock held at the close of business on October 19, 2016. Yum China will start trading as an independent company on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “YUMC” beginning November 1, 2016.""

Forgive any slight calculation errors, I'm looking at hot pics of that daughter from Blue Bloods while I type this

Everything you’re asking involves thinking of trading not just as basic risk/reward (what is my max profit and loss) but also as a balance of reward and buying power.  Tying up buying power is a form of capital investment.  If it’s tied up in position A it cannot be earning you any more money than the maximum return of that position.  It's not available to put into Position B, C, D etc

In a cash (non-margin) account, the buying power used is equal to the maximum net loss, so it’s easy to think about.

So, let's say you're bullish on Netflix.  Currently at $98.55. Here's a variety of ways to play it using October 21st options (using that because it's past earnings so prices are inflated and easier to contemplate)

* Own the stock.  (Obviously) profit exactly equal to the change in the stock price

* Buy an ITM call.  The 98.5 call costs 5.35.  (Extra credit: Its delta is 0.53, meaning that, based on price alone, it will vary about half as much as the stock itself as the stock moves up and down.  Delta constantly changes and you have other factors but this is a rough approximation at the time you enter the position)

Your breakeven is 103.85.  If you want to hold this to expiration you will only make money if the price is above 103.85.  

If the price is above 103.85, you will make that price minus 103.85 (I'm going to ignore the breakage costs of actually buying and selling the stock)

If the price is above 98.5 and below 103.85 you will lose 103.85 - that price.  

If the price is below 98.5, you cannot lose more than the 5.85 you originally paid, but you will lose it all

Also, importantly, if the price of NFLX is above 103.85 at any time between now and expiration, you could exercise the option and take the immediate net profit

* Buy an OTM call.  This works in all the same ways as an ITM call, but it's relatively cheaper because it has no intrinsic value (if you buy it you have no reason to immediately exercise it because the stock price is below the strike price.  The stock price must go in the direction of the trade in order for it to make sense to exercise)

A 110 call costs 1.44.  So your breakeven is 111.44.  You cannot lose more than 1.44

* To recap at this point, you have to compare what happens at various prices on expiration day.  Let's choose 120

Stock only: Paid 98.55, receive 120. 22% gain

ITM call: Paid 5.35, receive 120 – 98 = 22.  311% gain

OTM call: Paid 1.44, receive 120-110 = 10. 594% gain

To show a downside case, say NFLX ends up at 80

Stock only: Paid 98.55, receive 80. 18% loss

ITM/OTM call: 100% loss

*Next, naked strategies.  Because we’re bullish the example here would be a naked put

You can sell a 98.5 put for 4.95.  Your basis is 93.55.  If NFLX expires above 98.5 your maximum profit is 4.95.  Your maximum risk is your entire basis.  If NFLX goes to zero before expiration, you will be forced to buy it at 98.5, sell it for 0, and you only collected 4.95.  So your max loss is like 1900% of your max profit 

If it finishes at 120, you make 4.95 (the maximum you can ever make)

If it finishes at 80, you make 80 – 98.5 = -18.5.  But you collected 4.95 on opening so your net loss is 13.55 

*Now, multi-leg strategies. It’s easiest to think about multi-leg strategies existing because of the absurd risk of naked positions.  If you enter a naked put that has a maximum loss of 93.55 (which is really $9,355) – your broker is going to want security that you can actually afford to pay that potential loss.  So, it can either be secured with cash or margin, but in either case, that buying power is taken away from you as security. 

A naked put is a perfectly reasonable position for many instances.  But going back to the buying power concept,  If you have a $10k account, this position takes up basically all of your buying power.  Your maximum return on all of your capital is 4.95.   

So in many other instances, it makes sense to use multi-leg positions to balance the reward and buying power

* The first type of spread is a simple vertical.  In this case, because you’re bullish, there are two types

PLEASE NOTE: For all of these the principles above hold – you could buy them ITM or OTM, and your returns will be much higher buying OTM, but your chances of making that return are much lower. Only going to do ITM examples below.

First, a bull put spread.  This involves selling one put and buying another at a lower strike. You collect cash at open.  If the stock finishes above the higher strike, both puts are worthless, and your profit is what you collected at open

If it expires between the two strikes, you lose the amount of the higher (sold strike) minus the stock price, netted against what you collected at open

If it expires below both strikes, your MAXIMUM loss is the spread between the two strikes, netted against what you collected.

So let’s do a 95/98 bull put spread.  You collect 1.30 at open. 1.30 is your max profit.  Because the spread is 3 and you collected 1.30, your maximum loss is 1.70.  

As important, your buying power is only reduced by the maximum loss of 1.70.  So in this case, you have a chance to make 1.30 on a 1.70 “investment” of buying power.  Which is 76%.  Compare this to the naked put, where you could make 4.95 on a 93.55 investment of buying power.  If you have a $10k account, you could trade 58 of these, and have a maximum return of 58 * 1.30 = 75.4  With a naked put your max return is only 4.95 because you can only trade one of them

* You could also buy a bull call spread.  This involves buying a lower strike call and selling a higher strike call.  At the same strikes, this is essentially the same as a bull put spread.

A 95/98 bull call spread COSTS 1.66.  Your maximum profit is 1.34.  All the returns directions are the same as a bull put spread. 

The choice between a bull put spread and bull call spread is a complex one for another time (you can google) but if you’re new to this I would just use bull put spreads because they’re the foundation of even more complex positions and it’s easier to learn that way

You can think of spreads as flipping a coin that has slightly skewed odds.  In the example above you can make 1.30 or lose 1.70 (you can make or lose less than either of those figures but never more). 

* So, to review all of this, assuming you’re bullish

If you buy a stock you make the exact movement of the stock price. You would only lose 100% if it went to 0, but you cannot lose more than what you paid. You cannot lose more than 100%.  Your returns are unlimited. Your buying power is reduced by the full amount you pay for the stock.

If you buy a call option, you might make a much higher return on invested capital, but you lose 100% even if the price just goes below your strike.  You cannot lose more than you paid though. You cannot lose more than 100%.  Your returns are unlimited. Your buying power is reduced by the amount you pay for the option

If you sell a naked option, you collect the maximum return as long as the price is above your strike, or you make some return as long as it’s above your breakeven. But your maximum loss is many orders of magnitude than your max profit (your loss could be MORE than 100%). Your max return is capped and your max loss is extreme. Your buying power is reduced by the maximum loss.

If you use a spread, both your max profit and max loss are defined.  You can make your full return or you can lose a defined amount.  You are setting the max loss % at open. Your buying power is reduced by the maximum loss (much smaller than a naked position). 

* There’s a variety of other positions that are bullish but starting with the above is the foundation.  Always be thinking about where you position falls on three axes: risk, reward, and invested capital (buying power) 

Also, you ARE a fucking faggot u/SubIlmlnaI I know I say that about a lot of people but I really mean it when I say it about you

Isn't the profit just going to cover the cost of the interest payments thereby nullifying any ""gains?"" Unless the value has gone up significantly, wouldnt a seller just be breaking even?

Asked in the weekly Q&amp;A thread to no avail. I have read up a lot recently on Deutsche Bank. Unfortunately I hold a portfolio that consists of a lot of db-x trackers like S&amp;P, DAX, EuroStoxx, etc. Heres a link   http://m.citywire.co.uk/money/etfs-what-you-need-to-know-about-counterparty-risk/a509199  
I have concluded that Deutsche Bank is the counterparty to at least 90% in all of these instruments, which is particularly worrying since it seems the trade volume is so low that it wouldnt make sense for somebody else to buy out the swaps in case of bankrupcty. In SEK´s, the daily trade is around 650 000.- which comes out at 65k-ish USD. In a physical ETF, the assets wouldnt be thrown away, but they may be lended out by a bank who then cant reimburse the ETF holder.  
  
Anyway, at the friday close, the German bluechip index was up 1.01 %. The corresponding Deutsche Bank tracker db-x DAX was down almost 3%. Are people allready running for the hills? I asked a buddy at a hedge fund and he said he couldn´t tell me yes or no, assuming he doesn´t want me to sell at a huge loss and blame him or keep in the market and blame him.

16-10-01,55f8nt,Starting Investment Club,"Hello,

I am not sure if this is the best place to address this question but hopefully you guys may be able to provide helpful information or redirect me somewhere else.

I would like to start an investment club at my university managing a portfolio. Now I have questions of where we would be able to receive money even a small amount to start off the fund. If we fail to get the funds to start a real investment portfolio, would it be useful or beneficial for us to go ahead and do a virtual simulator where we use the real markets with fake money and attempt to make gains? I would like to use this club as a chance for me and others to learn and to help my resume.

Thank you! ",0

I'm new to investing and am interested in trying to time things a bit. By a ""bit"" I'm not talking about day trading or even week trading. I'd like to start by trying Regression to the Mean. Say, a linear regression of the S&amp;P index. I'll save money in the bank and only invest when the index is below its mean. I'd probably do this through a Vanguard 500 fund. 

This seems like a pretty conservative strategy. You could take a pretty long time frame to set your mean...say about 10 years. Has anyone tried this? Any good daily charts that can give you linear regression line? Would it work well for an individual stock?

This week we are taking a -rather brief- look at the insurance industry. After providing a historical perspective, Shiller turns to the widely followed story of the collapse of American International Group, or AIG.

###Study Material
- Watch | [Transcript](http://oyc.yale.edu/transcript/1073/econ-252-11) | [YouTube Lecture Week 5: Insurance: Its Opportunities and Vulnerabilities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfK9rCDCicE)
- Read | Chapter 6 | Fabozzi, Foundations of Financial Markets
- Do | [Multiple Choice Test](http://oyc.yale.edu/sites/default/files/ECON252_05_013111_MC.pdf)

###Additional Reading
- Michael Edesess, '[Catastrophe Bonds: An Important New Financial Instrument](http://www.edhec-risk.com/edhec_publications/all_publications/RISKReview.2014-09-09.0308/attachments/EDHEC_Working_Paper_Catastrophe_Bonds_F.pdf)' (2014)
- Frederic S. Mishkin, '[Over the Cliff: From the Subprime to the Global Financial Crisis](http://www.nber.org/papers/w16609.pdf)' NBER Working Paper No. 16609.

This weeks' chapter in Foundations of Financial Markets is relatively straightforward. It may provide you with some interesting information for personal finance purposes. 

Since this chapter is somewhat shallow on the role of insurance in financial markets, I decided to add two papers. Over the Cliff portrays how the 2008 financial crisis unfolded from an academic perspective, and the role of AIG therein. Catastrophe Bonds elaborate upon a subject which Shiller addresses during his lecture. Both are very readable, and the latter is relatively short. Would recommend both for the sake of this lecture.

16-10-02,55juez,AMZN Question,"I was looking into AMZN's fundamentals and it brought up a question that I can't seem to work out, so I thought I would post here to get all of your insight. 

AMZN is a marketplace, where sellers can meet with buyers. Say I buy an iPhone for $1000 from a seller. Does AMZN post that $1000 to their revenue, or does it go straight to the seller, without ever getting onto AMZN's books? I know that AMZN takes about ~20% from their seller's transaction price, so is the $200 the only thing that goes onto the books, or does the full $1000 go on, crediting the $800 as a COGS? 

As a company with a lot of costs, I think it would be internally beneficial for them to count the full $1000 as revenue because that will act like more of a sponge to soak up their other costs and make them seem more profitable. (Is this illegal?) I definitely think ONLY the $200 should be accounted for as revenue, but I am not sure if that is how they calculate it.  

I ask this because I think that putting this onto AMZN's books would artificially inflate their revenue and in turn create unreasonably low cost ratios. Does this make sense, or am I blowing the whole thing out of proportion? ",19

16-10-02,55jw45,Question about Free Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure (also asked in r/finance),"Hi everyone, I'm trying to analyse the financial statements of a few companies (trying to find that Cash Flow to Equity), but I hit a few snags. Any help would be really appreciated.

When calculating a firm's Free Cash Flow, the general rule is:
FCF = OCF - ΔNet Working Capital - CapEx.
CapEx seems to be defined online in two ways: 

1) CapEx = ΔPPE + depreciation

2) CapEx = ΔNet Fixed Assets + depreciation

Most online sources seem to act like these are the same things, but, firstly there are often many other fixed assets than PPE, and secondly, the CapEx value on the Statement of Cashflows usually doesn't equal the ΔNet Fixed Assets + depreciation.

So I had three questions:

- Firstly, which one of these formulas should I use?
- Secondly, does 'depreciation expense' in the Stat Cash Flows usually refer to all Fixed Asset depreciation or just PPE depreciation?
- Thirdly, if, as I suspect, CapEx refers only to purchases of PPE and not other fixed assets, then what do we say about the other purchases of fixed assets similar to PPE that are not part of Capex (as far as free cash flow is concerned)? 

For instance, as well as PPE, First Solar lists among its fixed assets:

- PV solar power systems
- Project Assets

All of these would have required cash flows to fund them, depleting the Free Cash Flows available for distribution to Stock and Debt holders. However, since these are long-lived asses, they are not part of Net Working Capital. How is this accounted for if the FCF must fall but they aren't part of CapEx? Why does finance use such constraining definition of Capital Expenditure?

Also, how does the FCF calculation account for purchases of long-lived (ie not cash-like) financial investments like illiquid bonds? Do we ignore those since those cash flows could equally have been remitted to investors?

I did search previous posts and there was one question similar (but not identical) to this has been asked here before :

https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1t1w9j/is_it_safe_to_assume_that_capex_net_cash_used_in/

but that was more to do with CapEx's relation to Accounting Cash from Investments rather than FCFE, so I'm still a little confused. Thanks for any and all help!",3

16-10-02,55k5aw,New Nemaska video hints at supplying for Tesla,"They just released this video stating that they will be producing lithium for 500K electric vehicles with a range of 400Km, and so I think there is a good chance they are talking about Tesla. 


Tesla have preliminary agreements with other junior mining companies such as Pure Energy Minerals, however they are all contingent on them actually being able to produce. There are a lot of lithium competitors out there and all of them are racing to to reach full production potential by 2018, the time when demand for lithium will likely outstrip the supply. 

Tesla have said in the past that they want to buy locally whenever possible. They chose Nevada to build their Gigafactory battery production facility largely because the Clayton valley is home to many junior mining operations, but also because Albemarle, the only fully operational lithium production facility in the USA, is located there. Of course, if Tesla are unable to get enough raw material from these local operations, they will have to go further away in order to meet their supply requirements. I never thought Nemaska would be a possible supplier for Tesla, as it's not even located in the USA, however I think there is a chance they are now getting involved.

16-10-03,55lpbj,Understanding Call / Put Options,"Hello, long-time reader and first-time poster. I'm hoping someone with a thorough understanding of options trading can explain something that I just haven't been able to find an answer to on google. I'll give a bit of context of my understanding / scenario so that someone can correct it if wrong.

Let's say I'm interested in buying a call option that expires this month (10/30). The stock I'm interested in is currently priced at $13. Let's say I'm interested in an out-of-the money option with a strike price of $20. Let's also say the option is $100 for 1000 contracts (so 10 cents per contract). Now, in all of my online research I've tried, the scenario that is always discussed is what happens when I have the right to exercise the option at $20 before expiration. The P/L when using my brokerage's ""Profit-Loss Calculator"" shows that if I then sell-to-close the option at $21, my profit is $900 ($1,000 - $100). 

What I don't understand is how the math is derived for prices below $20. For example, the P/L shows that my profit would be almost $600 if the price is 16.50 tomorrow. Clearly, I don't have a right to exercise this option, so is the math based on the PRESUMED price of the contract I purchased? Is the implication in my case that the option would be around 70 cents per contract, thereby allowing me to sell the option I just purchased and yielding ($700 - $100 = $600) in profit? Otherwise, I don't understand why the P/L shows what it does. 

If my understand in that situation is correct, would it be then correct to say that the presumption is based on no change in volatility and that the bid-ask for the contract may be entirely different that is what shown now based on the the stock's movement tomorrow?

Thank you to anyone who can answer my question!",2

Coca Cola's income statement says that their **total revenue has decreased on average 1.5B every year for the past 2 years**, their **gross profit has decreased 800Mn every year for the past 2 years**, **operating income has decreased 800Mn every year for the past 2 years**, **Net Income from Continuing operations has decreased by 650Mn every year for the past 2 years**, and their **net income has decreased by 650Mn every year for the past 2 years**. But they are still on an uptrend, even though their financials have been continuously decreasing every year, and even though they have the (What I call) decay from the dividend yield.

And, their earnings has gone up even though their net income has gone down. What?

------

My second question being that on Coca Cola's [""Cash Flow"" statement](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KO/financials?p=KO), they say that **they have lost around 4 Billion in 2013, 7.5 Billion in 2014, and 6 Billion in 2015 in ""Investment activities""** As well as the ""Sale Purchase of stock"" has costed them around 2.5 Billion every year. Does this mean they are buying their own stocks? And if so, why? Also, their ""Treasury Stock"" has costed them an average of 42 Billion every year for the past three years, further indicating they have bought their own stocks (?). Why?

So basically if you wanna go long, and you don't feel like buying now, then we should have another chance in a couple months before it gets cold.

# **WEEK AHEAD: What traders will watch next week besides Deutsche Bank** - *[(CNBC.com)](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/30/what-traders-will-watch-next-week-besides-deutsche-bank.html)*

*****
&gt; ### U.S. stocks will kick off the final quarter of the year with a week of major economic data, while concerns around Deutsche Bank hover.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### The September employment report is the big news traders are waiting for, but September ISM manufacturing data due Monday will also be key since it showed a shocking contraction for the month of August.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### ""I think it's the jobs data, and the ISM report next week. Some of the high-frequency data, are they confirming the slowdown we saw mid-third quarter, or is that a blip?"" said Russ Koesterich, head of asset allocation for BlackRock's Global Allocation Fund.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### Trade could be choppy as history shows market volatility, as measured by the CBOE Volatility Index, has surged every October of an election year since 1992, according to quantitative analysis using Kensho.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### Jeff Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab, says he sees more volatility to the downside than upside right now. He also says the market is ripe for a pullback of 5 percent or so.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### ""We've probably seen a lot of the gains we'll get this year, and we'll see more ups and downs that will define the fourth quarter more than a passing of one direction or the other,"" Kleintop said.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### U.S. stocks ended a choppy week slightly higher, after falling and rising with oil prices and then Deutsche Bank shares. The S&amp;P 500 closed at 2,168.27 with energy the best-performing sector of the week.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### New York–traded shares of Germany's largest bank hit record lows in the past week on mounting worries about the struggling lender that have evoked concern about another financial crisis. The German government ruled out state aid for the bank as it faces the U.S. Department of Justice's demand for $14 billion in settlement over mortgage bonds. Other media reports in the last two days raised concerns that a handful of funds are less willing to do business with Deutsche Bank. 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### But shares rebounded Friday in their best day since 2011 after an AFP report that the bank is close to a $5.4 billion settlement with the DOJ. CNBC has not independently confirmed the report, and there arereasons to be skeptical about the stated number.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### ""I think just given how depressed the name has been in the stock over the last couple weeks, you're getting a huge reaction in the stock on headlines either way,"" said Drew Forman, co-head of trading at Macro Risk Advisors.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### Investors will be watching for any incremental developments on Deutsche Bank over the weekend, which is a three-day one in Germany since Monday is a holiday.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### ""I don't see any over-the-weekend rescue looming for Deutsche Bank,"" said Holger Mertens, head portfolio manager, global credit, at Nikko Asset Management. ""What has to change here is the perception of the bank that is out there.""
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### Another issue for markets to eye over the weekend is the official inclusion of the Chinese yuan as the fifth currency in the International Monetary Fund's Special Drawing Rights basket. The inclusion increases the attractiveness of the yuan, also known as the RMB, as an international reserve asset that central banks can readily use.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### ""The RMB joins the SDR formally on Oct 1. Some people would argue that ahead of the formal entry, they've been bending over backwards to keep the currency stable so afterwards, they might have less of a reason to keep it stable,"" said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### Traders have watched the currency since surprise devaluations last August shocked global markets with concerns of negative spillover from a sharp slowdown in China's economy.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### China's markets are closed next week for a national holiday, and barring significant developments around European banks, strategists generally expect U.S. markets to focus on domestic news. Analysts polled by Reuters expect the September ISM manufacturing due Monday to show 50.3 after a 49.4 print for the prior month. Friday's nonfarm payrolls report is estimated to show a rise to 170,000 for September after a print of 151,000 in August.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: October Worst Month of Election Year**
&gt; October has a frightful history of market crashes such as in 1929, 1987, the 554-point drop on October 27, 1997, back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, Friday the 13th in 1989 and the 733-point drop on October 15, 2008. During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in point and percentage terms. It is no wonder that the term “Octoberphobia” has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month.

&gt; But October has also been a turnaround month—a “bear killer”. Twelve post-WWII bear markets have ended in October: 1946, 1957, 1960, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1987, 1990, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2011 (S&amp;P 500 declined 19.4%). However, eight were midterm bottoms. This year is neither a midterm year nor is a bear market in progress, thus October’s performance in past election years is of greater importance.

&gt; Election-year Octobers rank dead last for Dow, S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 (since 1980). NASDAQ fairs slightly better, with October being the second worst month in election years since 1972. Eliminating gruesome 2008 from the calculation provides a moderate amount of relief, as rankings climb to mid pack. Should a meaningful decline materialize in October it is likely to be an excellent buying opportunity, especially for any depressed technology and small-cap shares.

16-10-03,55nsd7,Perfect retirement investment once you cash in your gainz.,"According to my autistic calculations, and assuming you keep two of the rooms for you and the Asian girl from MAST (second room is for her shoes), you only have to rent the other 28 staterooms on board for a little over $3,800 per night year round to break even in 5 years. It seems pretty clean and shiny so maintenance doesn't really factor in and I'm guessing a hat on the bar for gas money and docking fees should suffice as long as you don't rent to a bunch of tight wads. Also of course, you need to buy this baby for cash.

Basically it seems like a sure thing investment once you cash in your chips.

16-10-03,55n13n,Reddit Weekly Stock Picking Challenge for the week of (10/3-10/7) is open for picks! *Rationale Required*,"Whelp, this is a REALLY short notice for you guys here at r/stocks for this week's challenge (my apologies!), but I was wondering if anyone here would be interested in participating on a weekly Reddit stock picking challenge?

I have been test running these contests on r/StockMarket for the past month or so now and they seem to be gaining some traction each week slowly but surely. If anyone is at all interested to participate in this week's challenge [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/55d2du/rstockmarket_weekly_stock_picking_contest_for_the/) is the link to this week's contest. I can however only accept picks up until the cash market open at 9:30am eastern time. Again, sorry for this very short notice this week!

I was also thinking of maybe conducting this same challenge for members of r/stocks (in other words -- said contest would be a completely separate contest from r/StockMarket) ... would anyone here at r/stocks be interested in such a contest here on this sub?

I wouldn't mind to run a dedicated weekly stock challenge for r/stocks as well ... let me know!

Also to the mods here at r/stocks I have gone ahead and added r/stocks to our list of recommended subreddits on r/StockMarket. I wasn't even aware that we were featured under ""related subreddits"" here! Very cool.

You guys here at r/stocks are some of the coolest bunch I've come across in the past. If you guys recall I used to post the daily Stock News Movers threads here some months ago. I may get that going here again too if there is any interest.

Anyway, sorry for the lengthy post, but just thought I would post this thread in here for those interested.

Hope you all have a fantastic trading week, month, and quarter ahead!! :)",3

The competitors were selling cameras for 50% cheaper, which means that either:

1. The competitor's cameras and systems suck.

2. TASR was vastly over-charging and should have a monstrously good earnings. 

3. The competitor is trying to get a foothold in the market and is taking a big loss in this move. 

EDIT: Turns out it's #3:  ""Vievu has agreed to a ""significantly unprofitable contract,"" and appears to be providing free body cameras to 5,000 police officers, the firm said in a note cited by TheFly""

In other words, analyst dropping the rating based off of a fear that the price of body cameras will significantly fall is rubbish.


In any scenario, TASR still comes out on top.

16-10-03,55o4ki,Buy the dip. Every time.,"So last week we learned about [DB](http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/DB%20IMF%201.jpg)

Derivatives are just like insurance. You are betting that price will go a certain way. Now, non retards among us that not all of those derivatives DB is handling are ITM. 

That is why [Yellen wants to buy equities](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-yellen-purchases-idUSKCN11Z2WI) 

Usually, when us plebs try to write naked calls or puts, banks make us have enough cash or assets to cover that. Who makes sure when banks are writing naked calls and puts?

These scumbags have over-leveraged themselves again. I mean, why wouldn't they? No one got punished last time.

No government can afford to let assets crash, because it will trigger the derivatives and crush every bank. Now, in reality, it's a bit more nuanced than that, but I don't think it's too far from the truth.

[Look at this picture again.](http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/DB%20IMF%201.jpg) Would you let assets crash if you were Yellen?

Buy the fucking dip. Every time. 

This only applies to large caps though. Yellen doesn't give a fuck about your penny stocks or shitotechs.

16-10-03,55nl1l,"Matt Levine's two models of investing; why active investing may be getting harder over time","&gt; It seems to me that there are two basic models of how investing could work over time. One is sort of a random walk: Some stuff makes money sometimes, other stuff makes money other times, it's always hard to know which is which, and the trick is to find a good manager who knows. This is sort of the default model that everyone has in the back of their minds, the model that those Harvard kids are using. Just figure out how to buy the stuff that will go up, and buy it. Or: Figure out who will figure it out, and give them your money.

&gt; The other model is sort of a random walk with drift: Some stuff makes money, some stuff doesn't, but over time we as a society learn to identify which is which. We learn to index, to look at value and momentum factors, not to invest in tulip bubbles, whatever. The learning is imperfect, and there are setbacks -- sometimes we invest in mortgage bubbles -- but over time the drift is in the direction of knowledge. This would seem to make the investing business harder over time. If asset returns are widely dispersed and hard to know, then there will always be a mystique around someone who knows them, and that person can always charge 2 and 20. If markets become more efficient over time, and asset returns approach their correct risk-adjusted level, and this gets easier for everyone to figure out, then the opportunities to make outsize returns -- and charge for them -- will keep shrinking. And people who thought they were exceptional -- hedge fund managers, Harvard -- will revert to the mean, and feel disappointed and adrift.

16-10-03,55phcd,Best Defined Benefit Plan Manager,"First, I'm not sure if this is the best subreddit for this, but I'm hoping for some input from someone more knowledgeable than I. If this needs to be deleted, I get it.


So, I work for a small company. After discussing investing and the benefits of low fee index investing with the CFO, I learned that the current manager of our small pension plan (SunTrust) charges exorbitant fees (&gt;1.5%/yr) for less than stellar performance.
The CFO then told me that if I wanted a change I should ""figure it out and present it."" Since I am one of the few official employees of this company (most of our labor is 1099), I definitely want to figure this out. The CFO is content with the status quo. I know the drag of &gt;1.5% fees/yr is massive over the life of any portfolio so I really want to change this. I did some preliminary research and learned that both Betterment and Vanguard are not willing to touch Defined Benefit Plans because ""legality.""


Googling is not really yielding any especially clear answers, and the company that set up the pension ""refuses to give investment advice."" Obviously, SunTrust doesn't want to help. Does anyone have any experience with this kind of thing? Who best can manage our currently small (~2 million) pension plan? I would also gladly accept advice on where I can go to find the answer to this question.",2

16-10-03,55opo8,Why PTN will pop by EOM.,"Ok guys listen up.

PTN, also know to hedge funds as Palatin Technologies, is probably the best biotech you can dump your money into this month.  It meets all the criteria:

* Under $1 per share
* Consistent EPS of -0.08
* Not one but TWO drugs in their pipeline right now

Seriously, look at their FDA calendar and count the number of drugs you see. They have Bremelanotide and PL-3994.  Phase 3 results for Bremelanotide are due a couple days before earnings so thats like double the pop. 

Even better is their balance sheet.  If you go look at their Balance sheet on yahoo finance (cus you’re lazy and can’t actually understand let alone read a 10k) their “leverage” looks pretty good. Their current Liabilities are at about 28.6M which is the largest ever.  This means a huge upside potential if their P3 results are good.

Full Disclosure: I’m in with 5000 shares at .49 and don’t care what you do.

Here is a chart that shows my price target: https://www.tradingview.com/x/wc96zyLb/

16-10-03,55oyx5,"$MACK, you have become a true buyout candidate.","If you haven't heard the news already, the current CEO resigned, and one of the board was admitted as interim CEO. 

This may seem like detrimental news to the company, but I don't believe this is anything but positive. I cannot say the previous CEO was doing anything to really help the growth of a company, especially with the drug and pipeline it has. That CEO also said he had no interest in selling the company in the short term and did not honestly have the shareholders in mind at all.

I also do not believe he resigned, more forced out by the board.

In regards to the 22% cut of employees, this has saved the company about $200million, which leaves them enough cash to survive into late 2017. This is a very similar position to what $RLYP was in just prior to its buyout. Also, this kind of move usually happens post buyout anyway, so this has saved any potential suitors from needing to do this.

The stock price is a general over reaction, and honestly I am very happy about it, as it is a great opportunity to accumulate. 

I have a price target of $10+ minimum. I am also looking to the presentations of MM-302 starting on the 10th of October. 

**If I have missed anything, or I need to clarify my views, please let me know. I wrote this very quickly.**

Why?

An OPEC output freeze itself will have little effect on oil prices since the projected output levels would still be all time highs. U.S. rig count is steadily climbing (albeit slower than in past years), and inventories are still near capacity. At this point it's all about generating buzz and good feelings rather than fundamentals, and it's going to stay that way for a while. If we look back to the last time OPEC tried to come to an agreement (Doha in April), prices sat in the same range and just went back and forth for nearly 2 weeks. Anyone with half a brain could have made 10% flips each day by setting simple limits.

Expect 1-2 news stories coming out each week with some OPEC member saying ""Oh yes, we will freeze, and of course my friend over in [insert oil country] will be doing the same."" to keep oil prices &gt;$50. And in between these stories, Brent will slowly return to the $50 threshold as doubters start becoming more vocal.

How to Play (for Idiots):

Buy: UWTI below $23 or DWTI below $64***

Sell: UWTI above $25.50 or DWTI above $70***

*** Ranges may change due to tracking error ***

TLDR: Oil is going to sit in this range for a while, play the peaks/dips on UWTI &amp; DWTI to get yourself a yacht with little risk.*

16-10-04,55rwff,Interesting options strategy I just came up with. Would this work?,"Hello, I'm new to this whole thing and am currently preparing for an internship at UBS next summer, so pardon my financial illiteracy.

I'm currently trying to learn more about options, and I think it's a good timing, considering that October is expected to be 'Bumpy'.

I have learned the basics with Puts/Calls, but I still have no clue on how to calculate profit, or decide whether it is worth to buy a few weekly SPY puts every week in case of a crash, or if a few monthly SPY puts would be best when it comes to returns/potential loss.

**I buy $10 of Weekly SPY put options at a strike of $206 with an ask of 0.01, so if the market goes down, this becomes tens of thousands. Correct?**

So I can just spend $10 for a potential return of Thousands? Eventually the crash will happen, so if I do this for an year straight (Buying the highest-strike puts with the $0.01 ~~bid~~ ask), for 52 weeks, I will have spent $520, and made thousands somewhere along the way. Unless it doesn't crash in one week, it goes Little-By-Little. So I'd have to buy $10 every week, plus $50 on monthly puts (Maybe a lower strike, but still a low ~~bid~~ ask. ""Quantity over Quality""). I'd spend $1,080 (+Fees) in one year, and likely make tens of thousands (Whenever the bubble breaks, in case we're in one). And in case nothing happens, $1,080 isn't much when it comes to finance, or at least my personal finance.

This would be too easy, so what's the catch? If there's no catch, why isn't everyone doing this? Or are big funds doing this, since these numbers are nothing to them?",0

16-10-04,55rpzl,"I have a strategy, I've backtested on Bloomberg, I want to go deeper. Someone code for me pls?","I fucking wish this was a joke. Here goes nothing. 

Here's a strategy I think is just about perfect. It's basically just Greenblatt's magic formula strategy, but instead of ROIC, it's highest 6 month price momentum. 

There's a ton of data as to why momentum and value work, but I'm assuming you guys know this shit and don't need me to explain.
 
So here it is: 

1. pick an index (S&amp;P is safest)
2. Sort by ebit/ev. Highest rank= rank 1, second=2 and so on, just like the magic formula
3. sort by 6 month price momentum. same rankings
4. average the rankings. invest in the top 30. hold for a year, repeat. (just like the magic formula) 

I was able to backtest in Bloomberg with the following results over the 23 year period 1993-2016:

 -CAGR in US: 13.66%

-Outperformance in Europe is unreal, 16% CAGR compared to 6% for the market.

If I was good enough at coding to do this, I would just go on quantopian and do it myself. But I'm putting myself out there. For you guys to take advantage of me.

So I'm asking if any of you would like to help or test it yourselves. And then share the results with me.

Basically, what I want you to do is add a trailing 20% stop loss and take only the top 2-3 per month (still holding for a year and you end up rotating but 30 stocks total). Separate tests for each. This shit's already up on quantopian, you just have to put what's already there together basically.

As someone trying to break into the investment banking/asset management scene, I finally took the first step and I'm really happy to have landed a position as an equity analyst at my university's student-run investment firm. Definitely a super small accomplishment, but it's somewhere and I'm very excited and eager to learn more. This subreddit is a huge help as well!

I'm planning to apply as an entry-level equity researcher at a small M&amp;A firm over the summer, and I would need to submit a resume. Luckily, they accept college students with minimal experience, but where should I list my position as ""equity analyst"" for the club on my resume? Is it too petty to go under experience and should be listed under activities and interests?

Just getting an idea, advice from current investment analysts/hiring managers would be especially appreciated. Since I've never constructed a resume geared towards this, nor have I had any financial experience, it would feel weird to list my graphic/web design experiences and kind of hide this position towards the bottom of my resume.

Oh, as sort of a side note, I'm not doing this simply to put it on my resume. The position will entail a good sized load of modelling practice etc. and I really couldn't be more excited, just gotta know how I should represent it on paper.

If OPK is currently trading at $10.75 and someone believes that it will drop within the next week, why are there calls available for lower then the current trading price? Wouldn't someone just buy puts on it? I thought calls were for future price movements upwards and puts vice versa.

Treasury Yield --- The interest rate the U.S. government pays to borrow money for different lengths of time. The ten-year Note influences many financial mediums Remember low bonds or interest rates = higher stock market, high bonds or interest rates = lower stock market. This bond, which is sold at auction by the U.S. government, also tends to signal investor confidence. When confidence is high, the ten-year treasury bond's price drops and yields go higher because investors feel they can find higher returning investments and they do not feel they need to play it safe, but when confidence is low, the price goes up as there is more demand for this safe investment, and yields fall. https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yieldYear&amp;year=2016

NZD/JPY Note Bottom Support Level 72.88 --- NZD (the 'base currency') is quoted in terms of JPY (the 'counter currency'). The Yen is a historically low-yielding currency, making an attractive vehicle to fund carry trades (where traders borrow cheaply in JPY to buy higher-yielding currencies, including NZD). Investors tend to favor carry trades at times of optimism about global economic performance and stability; they shun them at times of market stress. This makes NZD/JPY sensitive to swings in broad-based market sentiment trends. https://www.dailyfx.com/nzd-jpy

16-10-04,55uxjv,Investing in the smallest countries,"For years now I've been investing in the world's markets via IEV, EEM &amp; VPL for the EU, ""emerging markets"", and ""pacific rim"" countries respectively. I looked at the prospectuses again recently to double check which countries' markets were included. Going down the list of countries ranked by 2016 estimated GDP (I used the IMF PPP list, the point stands regardless) the top 32 are covered except for Saudi Arabia, Canada, Iran, Egypt, Nigeria, Pakistan, Argentina, and Colombia. After that the coverage is very spotty at best.

Now some of these countries probably don't have well-developed stock indexes, and some of them are political enemies of the US so they are probably ignored for that reason. Canada is big enough and important enough to me that I pick up its market through EWC but how about the rest?

It's tempting to look at these countries individually and assume that they are a small percentage of the world's economic activity but that would be a mistake. As of 2016 if you add up the GDP from all the countries on the list, the ones which I'm missing out on with my securities represent 32.9% of world GDP! That number has been increasing over the years as well. In 2012 it was 20.6%, in 2009 17.4% etc.

The traditional categories for these countries eventually have to break and it seems we are close now. The ""emerging markets"" now represent 54.1% of the world GDP but growth is slowing. How about these truly emerging economies? How do I easily invest in them?

Thanks in advance for any ideas. Always looking for better securities to accomplish the same results.

For those of you that are asking about Gold, $NUGT, $DUST, or whatever else related to gold...DO A SIMPLE GOOGLE SEARCH!!! 


Gold does not just swing +/- multiple percentages on any given day. If it happens, there is ALWAYS a reason why and people will be talking about it EVERYWHERE. Open any news/market related site and you'll get your answer within minutes. 


As for today, to my understanding and knowledge, multiple reasons as to why gold tanked. Brexit fears, dollar getting stronger (when dollar gets stronger, gold naturally drops), as well as gold breaking its resistance today and a few other resistance broken today, multiple people speaking today regarding interest rate hikes, and tons and tons of economic data coming out this week.  


On another note, if you dont know how gold behaves and what it reacts to, please stay away. Just like you wouldnt/shouldnt invest in a company you know nothing about, gold is the same way. DO NOT invest in gold unless you know what youre doing.

16-10-04,55wn2i,Something fishy going on at Investview (INVU),"Curt Kramer is a well known stock manipulator with a rap sheet with the SEC a mile long.  Less than a penny stock, Investview (INVU), has sold their soul to the devil by engaging with Kramer and his new entity Vis Veras Group.  A 13d filing shows that Vis Veras now owns 9.99% of INVU.
""Dr."" Joseph Louro (a chiropractor) has filed miserably since taking over Investview 4 years ago.  INVU per its most recent quarterly filing has less than $15,000 cash and over $4 million in debt.  The stock has plummeted to less than 1 cent.  Until recently (after Kramer entered the picture) INVU traded between 0-5,000 shares per day.  In what appears to be desperation, since Kramer got involved trading volume has shot to over 1 million per day and in a recent week traded nearly the entire float of the company in 1 week.
While volume has gone off the charts the stock still sags at less than 1 cent.  Vis Veras Group, aka Curt Kramer, recently filed stating they somehow owned 9.99% of INVU.  This would traditionally have been restricted stock that can't be sold but as you can find with a simple search Kramer has attempted schemes to trade restricted shares in the past which landed him on the SEC hit list.
Any simple due diligence turns up all sorts of red flags on Kramer so why would a legitimate company turn to him?  Because this isn't a legitimate company in my opinion.  Revenues have plummeted under Chiropractor Louro and losses and debt have gone through the roof.  It appears the last ditch effort was to turn to a known stock manipulator in an attempt to get something for this ""company"".
Another simple search for the name Anthony Lotito Jr, COO of Investview, shows another history of lawsuits with none other than the Biden family.  There are claims that Lotito knowingly recommended a lawyer who was convicted of wife fraud and mail fraud to name a few in a hedge fund dealing with the Bidens.  Sounds like INVU runs with very suspect individuals.  Only in NJ right?

16-10-05,55wrxu,SKX - Strong Fundamental Buy,"http://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SKX?p=SKX

This is a strong buy based on the financial fundamentals.

Current P/E is 13
Forward P/E is under 12
Market Cap: 3.65B

Cash+Inventory+Receivables:  1.7B
ALL Liabilities: 0.77B
Stockholder's Equity: 1.5B

If you backed the stockholder's equity out from the market cap you'd get a forward P/E of less than 7 (and on a growth company).

The average P/E ratio over the past 5 years for SKX has been 30.  Currently it is at the lowest level its been in past five years.  Source: 

https://ycharts.com/companies/SKX/pe_ratio

Revenue Growth last year was 32%.  This year Q1 was around 24% revenue growth, Q2 was 9% revenue growth.  The explanation given (which I can believe) is that Easter fell in Q1 this year and last year it fell in Q2.  As a result, this year customers pulled orders in Q1 from Q2, so if we look at the first half together it was 16% topline growth.  Not as good as last year, but still a healthy growing company.  After Q2 results were released the stock dropped from $32 and now sits around $23.  My opinion is this is a major overreaction.  

Listen to the Q2 conference call.  The analyst call out the CEO for giving very conservative Q3 guidance.  Another analyst asks how Q3 was going (they were a few weeks into Q3 when the call occurred) and you can hear the CEO chuckle and say the few weeks they've had have been very strong.  

Product:  read reviews and look at the awards won.  Skechers produces high quality product that consumers love at a price point that beats the competitors.  They price their product lower because they aren't spending billions of dollars a year on celebrity endorsements like Nike.  High quality product at a low price point.

So, why is the stock price in the dump?

1.  The company is not splashy.  They are not Nike or Under Armour when it comes to signing 8 and 9 figure endorsement deals, and that's OK.  

2.  The management doesn't actively try to manage the stock price.  Management seems content to let things play out and not try to convince anyone the stock is worth more then it is priced at.  Their investor relations department is non-existent.

3.  There's no dividend to get the dividend buying funds to buy in.  That's OK because they are still in growth mode.  Dividend only makes sense when you've scaled as far as you can go.",5

I personally wouldn't hold it through the data because I like playing the run ups but now the actual data. There also isn't much more room to drop unless they release bad news. Which I don't think will happen until they fail the phase 3 (which will probably happen). It seems to be undervalued after the drop, just needs a bit of volume and some news to pop.

But with 3 divisions, which do you have to watch?

|In 2015|Sales|Profit (pre-tax)|Margin|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Consumer | $14bn | $2bn | 13%|
|Pharma | $31bn | $12bn | 37% |
|Devices | $25bn | $7bn | 27% |

Looks like them baby wipes and shampoo bottles can be largely ignored!

## Recent financials 

Perhaps the funniest thing in the annual is that JNJ doesn't stop with 5 years of financials but gives 11 years! And wow are they an amazing 11 years, in terms of growth and cashflow. Even through the ""great recession""!

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $70bn | $74bn | $71bn | $67bn | $65bn|
|EPS | $5.48 | $5.70 | $4.81 | $3.86 | $3.49|

And within the data, there is the remarkable R&amp;D spend figure of $9bn a year. 

## Competition

Let's ignore the Consumer business and focus on the big names in Pharma and Devices. Overall, JNJ's margin doesn't look best in class, but that's the Consumer business ""dragging"" down the figures. It's Pharma unit's 37% margin is respectable and the Devices' 27% is more than just respectable. Overall, the high return, stands out.

And for such a large business, it's remarkable to see Johnson &amp; Johnson has $16,341M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 5% of the market value of Johnson &amp; Johnson. What they doing to do with all that cash, I wonder?

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $126.61 for Johnson &amp; Johnson and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 7% to their target.

# Valuation

So the upside, isn't great. Treating it as a pharma stock, you'd think JNJ's pricey. As a Devices business, it's cheap. Versus a Procter and Gamble it's remarkably cheap!

# Dividends

Johnson &amp; Johnson is forecast to pay a dividend of $3.13 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $3.05 per share. That is a 3% growth. The forecast dividend of $3.13 compares to a forecast EPS of $6.69.

And on-top of the near 50% payout ratio, they are busy buying back stock.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -3% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 1%. In the 6 months to June, sales were up 2%. Earnings off 4%. 

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers in July, the Chairman / CEO made a really detailed statement about the vision of the business: the value of having 3 business lines, the above market growth, the strategic deals, improving markets, heavily investing in R&amp;D.

Taking it at face-value, I'd be drinking from the Kool-Aid. But the historic financials back it up nicely.

So, maybe this is one of them dependable, quality stocks. In fact perhaps its 3 great stocks in one?

Any objections?

16-10-04,55wdax,"ITCI DD (First time DD, please be gentle)","Some of y'all may remember Intra-Cellular Therapies from the other week due to the shares plummeting nearly 65% after there late stage phase 3 clinical trial failed. The company quoted “neither dose of ITI-007 separated from placebo on the primary endpoint, change from baseline on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score, in the pre-defined patient population.” The company blamed the outcome on ""an unusally high placebo response"" basically saying schizophrenic people are crazy and can't tell the difference from how good this drug is.

Here is what I found to be interesting about this trial, the drug was only used to treat schizophrenia, the company listed that it could be used to treat bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder and other neuropsychiatric diseases, such as dementia. The drug may have failed to show success in treating schizo but it could show promise in the other disorders listed in their pipeline. The next big step for this company is having promising data for there next clinical trial to treat Bipolar disorder which is currently a $4.2 billion dollar industry. Here is where I see this drug having huge success, many anti-depressants and mood stabilizers used to treat bi-polar disease have negative effects and are not able to treat the wide spectrum of the disorder, this drug could take over as being the go to medication to treat bi-polar disease. Other disorders that can be used to treat include multiple types of depression, Dementia, Insomnia, and some Autistic sleep disorder that I have no idea about but I am sure it effects 99% of y'all. ITCI is dedicated in getting this drug approved and as the major draw is that it has been shown to be safe. Many other drugs have been approved in which the data showed no improvement or where its not even safe (See [SRPT](http://fortune.com/2016/09/19/fda-drug-approval-exondys-51//)). The company has somewhere close to $442 million in the bank so it seems to me to be a good long term play that could pay out 1-3 years down the road.

If they cut 100% of R&amp;D their earnings per user can triple, but 4% of the global population still seems like a tall order - and nobody ever cuts R&amp;D that hard.

Likewise: Yes, eSports is going to grow, Marihuana is going to grow, Internet of Things and Renewable Energy and all that stuff is going to grow, but it does not obviously and easily translate into profits for the investor. 

He adds:

The chipmaker's revenue also was better than forecasts on improved pricing. Micron forecast better-than-expected current-quarter profit, as well, but investors are largely discounting that forecast due to an accounting change by Micron and broader market trends.

16-10-05,560tv7,What am I missing? A (flawed) strategy on using interest rate differences and forex hedging?,"I just can't figure out what's the catch. I must be missing something crucial, but I just don't see what.

Let's say I have savings in US dollars. (Alternatively, I can borrow USD at really low rates.)

Then, I can deposit money in a foreign bank account with insurance in a foreign currency. All legal and in solid banks.

Let's assume some currency of a developing country. High volatility, moderate to low political risks, high interest rates. (There are several such currencies I have in mind to diversify. I'm not talking about political risks at the moment, but I am aware of such.)

Let's say that such deposit would yield me 10% per year in that foreign currency.

The problem is of course the risk of that foreign currency losing value faster than the interest rate I'm getting paid in the currency.

If after the first year I get 10% more but that currency is devalued by 20% compared to USD, then I would end up with less dollars when converted back to US dollars.

To address that, I would simultaneously open a long position for USD/XXX with a forex broker
(I would in effect sell back that XXX currency and buy USD, for as long as the position remains open.)

So, I would take US dollars, convert them to currency XXX, deposit at a foreign bank at high interest rate.

At the same time, I would go long for the same amount (notationally) of XXX. I would use little leverage to make sure I don't get a margin call. Part of the available US dollar savings would be used for that.

The lot size of USD/XXX would match what I would deposit in a foreign bank in XXX.

If XXX goes up compared to USD, then my long position loses me money, but I make it back when converting that foreign deposit back to USD.

If XXX goes down, then my bank deposit would be worth less, but I would make money on my long position.

There is roll cost and conversion spread (both for the trade and for the deposit) and there are political risks and there is still a risk of a margin call, if leverage is greater than one.

But theoretically, I could even do with without leverage.

If I have, say, $200k. Then I would set aside $100k (plus the maintenance) for the forex broker.  And would open a lot for that amount (minus the maintenance), and would convert a matching amount to XXX and then would deposit XXX.

The way I look at it, I would effectively be getting 10% interest in USD. Well, that would be 10% minus the associated costs. But the costs could still be less than 10%.

And risks as really limited only to political risks. I wouldn't invest in a country that's at war. But there are plenty of developing countries that pay 10%+ on deposits in their currencies.

But must be missing something. It can't be that simple.

So what am I missing?

Would the rollover completely kill any profit margin?",4

Everyone fucking watches porn and anyone that says they don't is a dirty fucking liar. So why aren't there any publically traded porn sites? If pornhub can get the money to shoot a porno in space they sure as hell could get a fuck ton of money in an IPO. So after thinking about this for the past couple days while fapping and losing money I came up with a genius idea, make a publically traded and members only porn site that gives membership only to people that buy at least one share of the company. The price per share would be based on the quality of porn. So it could be worth as little as 10 cents a share or, if I could get some brazzers level quality, it could be 10 to 20 dollars a share. If I gave stock options to the porn stars I used it would also give them incentive to make really good porn because their pay would increase as their performance quality increased. Another thing I was thinking is that I could set milestones for the stock price so that as price per share increases new services would be offered in site. The main hiccup I'm having is trying to figure out exactly how the membership will work in the sense of only allowing a current shareholder to log in and figuring out how to keep people from sharing their memberships if they bought shares.  Someone tell me more reasons that this wouldn't work and why not, because I'm about to go all in on this fucking idea",15

16-10-05,55zkjx,Does this bug anyone else? - (Chart axis not starting at 0),"http://imgur.com/a/g55wo

The image explains what I mean.

I just created some fake data to show an example of what i mean.  Changes to any stock's price look dramatic when you start your axis close to the lowest value of the stock.  But if you start the axis at zero, it often becomes apparent that the change in price is minor.  I've made a habit of mentally accounting for it, but it really bothers me that most every website shows what feels like a very distorted view of such simple data.

**Edit**: to some of the people defending the adjusted axis, I think there are pros and cons that nobody is really disputing

Starting at 0

* Con: Detail is harder to see, and sometimes impossible to see
* Pro: Price change relative to total price is easier to see.

Starting at a value near the low point of the stock

* Pro: detail is easier to see.
* Con: detail is easier to see because it is exaggerated.  So the viewer must mentally compensate for this exaggeration.
* Pro: Price change relative to total price can still be worked out by looking at the axis, and doing some basic math.
* Con: at first glance, price changes are exaggerated.  (But of course, by paying attention to the axis, the viewer can mentally account for this).

With that in mind, I would argue that most people (although certainly not experienced traders) would benefit more from being able to see relative price changes without needing to do any math, than they would be from being able to clearly see minor details.

I'm surprised on /r/investing, where presumably most people aren't day trading, that people so strongly favor seeing the detail over the big picture.

alternative,  you can start the axis wherever you want if instead of showing me the stock price you assume I invested 1 dollar at the start of the time period and show me the value of my investment.  That would allow you to see detail and percent change easier.",6

16-10-05,560ygz,"stockAday: When will Under Armour's underbelly harden? $UA","# Key Stats for Under Armour Inc

Given we wrote on Nike last week, feels a cheat to cover $UA, but heck I don't make the choices, Redditors voted for it!

Plus it's fair to say, I'm scared to look at it... 66 times forward earnings!

# Description

Under Armour sells branded performance apparel, footwear and accessories for men, women and youth. Brands include: UNDER ARMOUR®, HEATGEAR®, COLDGEAR®, and ALLSEASONGEAR®. Its digital fitness offerings include MapMyFitness, MyFitnessPal, and Endomondo.

In 2015, sales of apparel, footwear and accessories represented 71%, 17% and 9% of net revenues, respectively. Licensing arrangements, primarily for the sale of our products, and revenue from our Connected Fitness business represented the remaining 3% of net revenues. 


## Recent financials 

The financials sort of say it all!

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $4.0bn | $3.1bn | $2.3bn | $1.8bn | $1.5bn|
|EPS | $1.05 | $0.95 | $0.75 | $0.61 | $0.46|

But in management's words

&gt; Our net revenues grew to $3,963.3 million in 2015 from $1,472.7 million in 2011. We believe that our growth in net revenues has been driven by a growing interest in performance products and the strength of the Under Armour brand in the marketplace. We plan to continue to increase our net revenues over the long term by increased sales of our apparel, footwear and accessories, expansion of our wholesale distribution sales channel, growth in our direct to consumer sales channel and expansion in international markets and engaging with consumers through our Connected Fitness business. 

Living in the UK, over 40, and rubbish at sport, I just don't know this brand. So I don't understand what's driving it. But whatever it is, it's powerful!

So let's dig deeper. Where's the growth?

|Metric|2015A|2014A|Growth|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Apparel | $2,801m | $2,292m | $510m | 
|Footwear | $678m | $431m | $247m | 
|Accessories | $347m | $275m | $71m| 
|License | $84m | $67m | $17m | 
|Connected Fitness | $53m | $19m | $34m | 

So of the $880m growth in sales, Apparel was the key... though all the other divisions clocked up impressive growth too.

Then what's the international perspective?

&gt; Our operating segments include North America; Latin America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); Asia-Pacific; and Connected Fitness. Due to the insignificance of the Latin America, EMEA, and Asia-Pacific operating segments, they have been combined into International for disclosure purposes.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|North America | $3,456m | $2,796m | $2,194m | 
|International | $454m | $269m | $137m | 
|Connected | $53m | $19m | $1m | 

Again looking at the $880m of growth, $660m came from the US. 

## Competition

From their Annual Return:

&gt; The market for performance apparel, footwear and accessories is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their production and marketing of performance products.

In particular they highlight Nike and Adidas. And when it comes to their stock price they suggest investors benchmark them versus S&amp;P 500 Apparel, Accessories &amp; Luxury Goods. 

The comparison is not flattering on the margin or returns front. Is that a concern, well, no! With topline growth there's no reason to not tolerate a lower margin. they are investing in growth.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Under Armour Inc | $4,423M | 12% | 15%
Nike Inc | $33,023M | 15% | 31%
VF Corp | $12,236M | 16% | 24%
Coach Inc | $4,492M | 17% | 18%
Ralph Lauren Corp | $7,339M | 14% | 8%
Lululemon Athletica inc. | $2,194M | 20% | 24%
Michael Kors Holdings Ltd | $4,714M | 28% | 42%

An aside: They are forecasting an annual tax rate of 36.5%. Twice Nike's! Someone's not been doing any tax optimisation, have they?

## Cash / Debt?

Under Armour Inc has $894M of net debt. That is 1.7x it's latest operating profit. Seems a little high for the business they are in. But it's not troublesome.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $48.70 for Under Armour Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 27% to their target. Which makes me sit up!

# Valuation

Really? a 27% upside when the stocks already on 66 times earnings? To use the Goldmans euphemism, this stock needs to ""grow into its valuation"".

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/ua/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
UA | $15,713M | 66x | 24% | 0% | 3%
NKE | $87,486M | 22x | 13% | 1% | 5%
VFC | $23,304M | 18x | 9% | 3% | 9%
COH | $10,307M | 17x | 12% | 4% | 10%
RL | $8,250M | 18x | 5% | 2% | 9%
LULU.O | $8,139M | 28x | 16% | 0% | 4%
KORS.K | $8,003M | 10x | 4% | 0% | 12%

# Dividends
Under Armour Inc is not forecast to pay a dividend this year.

# Governance

There are A and B shares, with the founder Kevin Plank having the B shares with 10 votes to every 1 vote for an A share. :( Though if you look at Nike, there's a similar structure! A flag for sure, though not a red one.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -3% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 2%. So no major changes there.

That's against the following backdrop at the 6 months results:

* Revenues increased 29% to $2.05B
* North America up 24% to $1.71B
* International up 62% to $299.5M
* Connected Fitness up 91% to $42M

So the machine keeps pumping! At the top line. 

For example, on the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers they are projecting sales of $4.925 billion for the year. That would be a growth of over $900m in the year...an acceleration versus last year. Now that's remarkable. The sort of thing you only see at tech companies ;)

Though, it seems that this ex-star stock has hit the rocks below the revenue line. Margins came under pressure in 2015. Again in the first half of 2016. And on the call, they said they are expecting continued margin pressure, which of course is weighing on the stock.

Do you buy into the topline story? Will it be like an Amazon or Netflix, where the cashflow eventually comes through? I don't see any reason to think otherwise, but in the meantime... will the stock see any love. I fear not. 

At least not until the hot money's truly capitulated. Mean, eh?

16-10-05,560h7m,Fossil fuel divestment from a pragmatic point of view?,"I recently watched Tony Seba's presentation on [clean disruption](https://youtu.be/Kxryv2XrnqM), his optimistic predictions about the impending rapid growth of electric vehicles, self driving tech and solar power.
 
 

Mr. Seba believes all new cars in 2030 will be electric and self driving and that very soon we'll achieve ""grid parity"", solar power for the same price point as electricity from the power company, and soon after: ""god parity"", solar being cheaper than the cost of transmission of power to one's home, even if we invented nuclear fusion. [Article](http://tonyseba.com/how-to-lose-40-trillion/)
  

Now, I'm sure plenty of people disagree with Tony's predictions or his time table at least. But let's say he's right and new cars in 2030 are EVs and fossil fuels have been decimated. How do you think this would affect the average investor? Would fossil fuel stock become worthless or would these companies adapt/shift toward solar/clean energy and retain value? How much better a position would an investor be in (in this hypothetical) if they kept a ""green"" portfolio as opposed to one with stake in fossil fuels?",1

First of all, I can't make sense of how these are priced. They seem very expensive compared to other options on similarly priced underlying stocks. Maybe due to volatility?

16-10-05,5623vh,UWTI: Why is this only a short-term investment?,"I've recently become aware of the ETN called UWTI (""VelocityShares 3x Long Crude ETN linked to the S&amp;P GSCI Crude Oil Index Excess Return""). I have a few questions about it, but I think I have to explain what it is first.

My layman understanding is that this ETN is effected 3 times on the S&amp;P crude oil index mentioned above. In the past week, I have left an investment in this ETN and it has returned a large amount of return in my favor. I don't 100% understand this investment, as it is rather complicated, but it seems to me that ETNs are more risky because there can be additional implications if something were to go wrong. First question would be why are ETNs more risky? I understand that this is much more volatile due to the '3x' nature of this particular ETN, but are ETNs inherently more risky?

With that said, I have been doing my homework and read about the OPEC countries' ""landmark"" agreement, an upcoming non-OPEC oil producers potential agreement with OPEC, and a number of other developing situations that should positively effect the price of crude.

What I am really having trouble understanding is why the whole internet suggests that this ETN should only be held for one or two days at the most, when the price of oil is at a low, the price of UWTI is about 1/200 what it once was, and the price of oil seems like it will continue to go up in the upcoming years.

Furthermore, I read an article about how UWTI can never truly fail because they will forever reverse split the shares to keep the price artificially high.

Any help and explanation would be greatly appreciated!!",8

-----------------------------------------------------------------

""During my routine DD (due diligence) yesterday regarding AMD institutional and insider holdings/purchases/sales I stumbled upon something very interesting. It seems on Aug. 29th an AMD board member director named Nicholas Donofrio PURCHASED 69,100 shares at $7.68 per share equaling ~$530,000 ! [Yahoo Finance](https://biz.yahoo.com/t/16/4114.html) , [Nasdaq link](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/amd/insider-trades), [direct pdf of SEC filing](http://services.corporate-ir.net/SEC/Document.Service?id=P3VybD1hSFIwY0RvdkwyRndhUzUwWlc1cmQybDZZWEprTG1OdmJTOWtiM2R1Ykc5aFpDNXdhSEEvWVdOMGFXOXVQVkJFUmlacGNHRm5aVDB4TVRFeE56WXdOQ1p6ZFdKemFXUTlOVGM9JnR5cGU9MiZmbj1BZHZhbmNlZE1pY3JvRGV2aWNlc180XzIwMTYwODMwLnBkZg==)

This is interesting and important because while it's common for executives to receive free stock options as part of their normal compensation package (and sell some of those free stocks to finance a purchase of a car or new roof, college tuition, whatever) it's unusual for a PURCHASE to occur, let alone one to occur BEFORE a stock offering and the Global Foundries amendment.

So what's going on? Why would this director purchase essentially on the open market RIGHT BEFORE A STOCK OFFERING?! $7.68 per share corresponds with the Aug. 29th trading day range. The director Nicholas Donofrio is also no dummy.

Nicholas Donofrio is currently on the board of AMD, on the board of New York Melon Bank, on the board of Delphi automotive, he was also on the board of IBM for many years, along with a regents board member for Connecticut. By all accounts Nicholas Donofrio is well versed in finance, in technology, and from his stock compensation the last 20 years VERY well versed in trading.

So what makes him so confident that he would be willing to purchase at $7.68 DESPITE knowing a stock offering and Global Foundries amendment were just about to be released which would undoubtedly impact the stock negatively?

My assumption is he is extremely confident in either Zen, Polaris, or perhaps even Q3... The timing of the purchase is very peculiar. He could have easily purchased after the stock offering, he could have easily purchased after Q3 (if he assumed Q3 would be negative). But instead he choose to purchase at nearly the 52 week high.. So what does this guy know that we don't?

Given the guy is VERY wealthy so perhaps half a million dollars is of no consequence to him. However if you look over his trading history, you will notice he has made VERY FEW purchases with his own money in the last 2 years all between $4,000-5,500 which frankly is chump change. At $530,000 AMD is definitely the outliner here. He also routinely receives free AMD stock through normal compensation package, why purchase on his own?
But why have no articles been released on this? Why is this the first I'm hearing of this and had to find it myself? Normally this is news that is published immediately. It's quite perplexing to me to say the least.
My only guess is he purchased at the high to prevent any accusations of insider trading (which he was accused of but never convicted of during his time with IBM). No one is going to accuse him of trading on insider information if he buys at the high right before a major stock offering. It's also extremely unlikely that a board member wouldn't know about a stock offering and the Global Foundries amendment. Board directors are the first to hear about this kind of thing and this must have been in the works for at least some time.

So what gives? What am I missing from this equation? What is everyone's thoughts on this?""",96

Here's how I envision doing that. ""I am gonna buy at $10 and sell at $11.5 or $9.5 using stop loss and limit sell""

So this would yield either a 15% gain or a 5% lose.

Then put a buy order in at 11.5 with the same thing going on.

Then repeat this forever.

[Recent News](http://surna.com/investor-relations/)

Notice that they have been awarded large contracts by some of the leading grow facilities in the US.

I did some digging last month and discovered SRNA, Average volume when I found it was around 400,000. It is up ~50% since I bought in at .094 and has seen 3-8 times the previous average volume in the past week. Nobody talks about this stock (the company does not self promote much it seems) but it is a very attractive company IMO as it's success is directly related to the American marijuana legalization initiatives on the ballot. I think as election time creeps closer more people will buy in for the inevitable election bubble and if a couple decent press releases get out it could rocket ship to a Market cap of around 150M-300M ($1-$2) but more likely it stays under a dollar and  max market cap of 40-50M(.3-.4 IMO). 

Let me know what you think and good luck out there.

RSI showed 28-30 when the price was 3.9, now its 68-72 (around 30 means oversold around 70 means overbought) meaning it was oversold before and now its overbought

I used to buy one future and ride it out till it was in my favor. this method worked but it could be gut wrenching. the last time i did this i bought the /es mini in late December at 2110 and blinked before it went down to 1875. I have started utilizing monkey bars and instead of scalping one future and riding it out I have been doing six. I trade it in the price point where the monkey bars have spent the most time looking for one point. I put my trades in a bracket with one point up 8 points down. I'm only getting $300 a trade but utilizing this strategy I've made 20 successful trades in a row without a loss. I typically do 3-4 trades a day if possible. Has anybody else tried this strategy? If you've  been successful scalping what has been your method. I currently put my monkey bars on a 2 day 30 min chart.",6

I've read it has the possibility of disruption shipments to the US.  Also I remember Katrina had a big impact on prices, but it also hit Louisiana.  This plus Iraq calling in organizations and media to cover their output going into the OPEC meeting gives me hope that prices will go higher.

16-10-06,5648um,How is `Return On Invested Capital` in the Magic Formula is calculated?,"Hi all,
I'm a newbie. The screening from https://www.magicformulainvesting.com/Screening/StockScreening recommends SSNI as on of the 30 stocks with market cap at least $100M. But based on my calculation, it has negative Return on Capital because its liability is greater than its asset. Did I understand the formula wrong?


I use this definition http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestmentcapital.asp, and then Fidelity screener to get the financial statements. I used:

EBIT = Operating Income Before Depreciation + Interest Income + Non-operating Income

Working Capital = Total Assets - Total Liability

Any thought?

16-10-06,5659sg,VR / AR stocktip for you fags $HIMX$,"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HIMX?p=HIMX

ok boys, here it goes.
Ive had this bad boy on my watchlist for some months now and about 10 days ago I finally decided to ""buy the dip"".

we are talking about HIMAX.
this company primarily produces displays and stuff like this and is one of the players in the VR and AR branch.
google owns 6% of their shares.
they are rumored to be in playstation VR.
their earnings will most likely be a success.

10 days ago, when I bought the dip, they lost about 15-20% due to one simple analyst downgrade, which is really suspicious and can be interpreted as a self made opportunity for hedgefunds to get a good entrypoint before this rocket takes off due to playstation vr and earnings later this month.

we are up 4% in premarket and I see this mofo at 10 dollarz minimum before elections.

This year has been average but it seems like there is a massive upside due to the RAM price boom forecast for Q4 2016 and 2017/2018. 

This upside has the potential to be massive as most analysts are forecasting the upcoming RAM price upgrade will be much larger than seen in 2015, and will potentially lead to a 30~50% higher valuation for these Korean companies.

16-10-06,564wth,My trades since Brexit,"http://imgur.com/a/M6Emy

These trades were all done after a somewhat yolo of my entire account at the time (~4000$) that brexit would go through and cause market panic for at least a little while, i have family in the UK and that event seemed way too close to call.  Put all my money on some relatively short term puts and pulled out a little over 100% overnight.

My previous experience in trading anything is literally just advice from a friend who did well for himself in the 08 crash, i had made a few long term way way OTM put bets that never really paid off.  The brexit bet was  my first real YOLO.

My only rules were basically never get too greedy, very limited trading when my sleeping schedule was fucked up, and only yoloing with money I won from the market to begin with (i had to deposit some of my savings to daytrade)

I basically set a value I thought the market was 'supposed' to be at (2160) and bought calls or puts accordingly.  I do not feel comfortable holding calls since most of my option buys were around 30 days out, and the market typically hasn't jumped more than 1% up, but volatility makes calls worth absolutely fucking nothing real quick.

My next big play is essentially all-inning on SPY puts about 60 days out when/if VIX goes under 11.

tl;dr high volatility buy calls low volatility buy puts ez money ez life. also i'm retarded and just throw money in extremely high risk options just hoping to get lucky",381

This has happened before where everyone gets hyped about weed stocks because pot is becoming more widely accepted and even legalized... so all of these junk, piece of shit companies who are listed on the OTC/Pink sheet exchanges start to fly (sometimes 1000-10000%).

Yes, the idea of making 1000% return in a short amount of time is enticing, but please remember, the vast majority of these penny stocks are penny stocks for a reason. The companies are not investment grade. They can pretty much make their financials be whatever they want them to be. 

Last time this happened, the people who got in early made some huge returns because they sold at the top.. but the people who hopped on the bandwagon a little too late or who failed to sell when they were up so much lost tons of money. Do not be one of those people.

This is not investing, this is gambling. These are great stocks to day trade and trade short term. Trade them to trade them and to make some nice gains, but DO NOT hold these all the way  up, then all the way back down. DO NOT buy these with money you can't afford to lose.

I saw people who made small fortunes and some who went broke trading weed penny stocks the last time around. For the record, I trade these myself but only for hours/days at a time.

16-10-06,566koj,Responsibility for Fraudulent Activity with Fidelity Investments,"Hello!

I just finished law school and am new to investing. I am not yet licensed as a lawyer. 

I was opening an account with Fidelity investments earlier today when I noticed something in their Customer Agreement. Under the section titled ""Your Commitments to Fidelity the sixth bullet point states:

""to keep secure your account number, username, and password, and
any devices, such as mobile phones or pagers, you use in connection
with your account""

I was a bit puzzled by this term. At first glance it seems to suggest that YOU the customer are responsible for keeping your account information secure. 

I called Fidelity to inquire about this. I was greeted by a nice woman. I asked her if this clause makes me (the customer) responsible for account breaches, and therefore Fidelity would not reimburse my account for losses resulting from a fraudulent breach of my account. After the ""We understand the complex landscape of the internet speech"" she said that Fidelity receives many calls from people who tell them that they have shared their account information with their children or spouse. 

She told me that in those cases where the customer has shared their information that information might be used against them. After hearing that, I asked if this clause enables Fidelity to argue against or deny reimbursement to customers whose accounts have been breached. She responded that she did not know and that my question would be better directed towards their legal team.

I then asked how I could be expected to check the box stating that I had read and understood the agreement when she herself clearly did not understand the agreement.

2nd edit: I can tell from the downvoting that this question and my responses were unwelcome. I came to this sub to ask in good faith whether or not anyone could explain the application of a specific clause in a contract for services with an online trading institution that this very sub recommends. Rather then take this legitimate concern seriously, everyone seems to be more interested in believing they know exactly how the clause in question would function in arbitration. I'm sure you're all licensed lawyers, unlike me, because you are all pretty cock sure you know exactly what you have agreed to. For your sake, I hope you're right. ",0
16-10-06,565vyr,"After seeing so many posts lately about marijuana based company's stocks...","Be careful.

This has happened before where everyone gets hyped about weed stocks because pot is becoming more widely accepted and even legalized... so all of these junk, piece of shit companies who are listed on the OTC/Pink sheet exchanges start to fly (sometimes 1000-10000%).

Yes, the idea of making 1000% return in a short amount of time is enticing, but please remember, the vast majority of these penny stocks are penny stocks for a reason. The companies are not investment grade. They can pretty much make their financials be whatever they want them to be.

Last time this happened, the people who got in early made some huge returns because they sold at the top.. but the people who who hopped on the bandwagon a little too late or who failed to sell when they were up so much lost tons of money. Do not be one of those people.

This is not investing, this is gambling. These are great stocks to day trade and trade short term. Trade them to trade them and to make some nice gains, but DO NOT hold these all the way up, then all the way back down. DO NOT buy these with money you can't afford to lose.

I saw people who made small fortunes and some who went broke trading weed penny stocks the last time around. For the record, I trade these myself but only for hours/days at a time.
Here is a fun read about the pot stock run last time and how it all ended up. I hate the traders in the article, but it is still a decent read.

Here is my DD please.

Yes it's not the biggest yolo out there, but I just figured I would talk about my reasoning behind aurora and why I think that even with its massive recent gains, its still a good investment.


ACB.V is another Canadian weedman company that has just hit the tsx venture exchange this week, basically taking it one step closer to being in the real TSX.  If it reaches the TSX in a year or so, expect big gains.

Right now they run off a 50k square foot warehouse and serve around 7700 medical patients. As they are ""officially"" only a ""medical"" company.

However, in anticipation of Canada's across the board legalisation of marijuana, they are in the process of developing a 600,000 square foot mega greenhouse, arguably the largest in door grow op in the world.

Their claim to fame is by selling weed at the lowest price by keeping the lowest overhead, so their prices are cheaper then most (5-8$ a gram). They sort of want to be the Walmart of weed, selling cheap chronic, since most delinquents who smoke the devils lettuce are poor as fuck, they will be drawn to this.

Risks: Trudeau says fuck you Canada and keeps weed illegal or heavily restricts it = GG no RE
Also if they can't fill a demand for their 600k warehouse, then their overhead may swallow the company and force them.to go under.

Additional: Colorado has a weed market value of over 1b and growing within a few years of legalisation. Canada has over 6x the population of Colorado. I would expect the Canadian weed market to be worth anywhere from 6-8b within a year or two of legalisation. Currently only 26 companies have the legal ability to sell or develop weed, the leading companies being cgc.aph and now ACB.

I already own like 10k+in cgc and 10k+ aph so fuck it, I going to ""diversity"" by going in the other runner up. When the market is booming in 3-4 years, these could easily be billion dollar organisations.


It could also be a huge bubble that will pop any second now so lel, fucking yolo you cowards, tonight we dine at the food bank.

16-10-06,567tjg,Future business model of Google?,"I own some Alphabet shares, thinking in the long term. However, something worries me: which will be their future business model?

Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, said this April that ""we are moving from a mobile-first world to a AI-first one"".

Google is pivoting from web search to AI assisting. Great, except for the fact that their main source of revenue are web ads. How will this fit with their new strategy? I don't see how they can monetize Google assistant. Selling hardware? They won't sell as much as Apple or Samsung, and I don't know if hardware manufacturing scales as well as software development. Licensing their AI technology? Android is actually not particularly profitable for Alphabet, actually (tons of users but little revenue per user).

If Google assistant gets massive usage Alphabet will figure out how earn money with it sooner or later, but would it be that profitable as web ads?",0

16-10-06,566wn3,I have a theory on why gold dropped that is partially backed up by real data. DD on Gold.,"Ok so we all know that London has been fixing gold prices for decades. We also know that they were ""caught"" manipulating gold prices. not that anyone was punished or anything.

Around 6 months ago China started their own gold price fix to compete/stop London from doing anything they wanted with it.

Also, this entire week, China is celebrating their (irony?) golden week. This holiday last for seven days and their market is closed all week because of it.

This info is all backed up and you can do your own damn google search if you dont believe it, faggots.

So here's my theory...

Now that china has shut down their market for an entire week, what if London is taking this opportunity to manipulate gold again while they can? If i were a banker with the ability, I sure as hell would do it.

Another theory I thought of while writing this is that its possible all the chinese gold bulls sold off their shit because they didnt wanna be helpless for an entire week. This doesnt really make a bunch of sense though because the price dropped on monday - today and not last week.

TL;DR Gold is gonna pop with a vengeance when china sees how low the price is, thats if London doesnt undo their shenanigans by Monday.

EDIT: another thing i want to add is that it makes no sense at all that gold moved in ways similar to the brexit for no apparent reason.",26

I expect a double top near $52 to cause a short term pull back but the strength of this move is very impressive and should continue higher. **Yes this is a useless post with regard to what happens tomorrow.**

-

However something fundamentally has changed. The price move up this week broke what would have been a bearish pattern forming. The fundamentals have changed and I think this has to do with possible war concerns between USA and Russia breaking out in the middle east. Now that Kerry has ended diplomatic relations with Russia and Russia has now put AA batteries in Syria stating that will shoot anything out of the sky that approaches it puts a lot of variables in question as to a possible war starting if the US does something stupid and provokes Russia to attack. I believe oil is quietly responding to this so for the time being while war is still a concern I would be neutral to bullish on oil going forward until this changes.

16-10-06,5674ce,Lennar Homes vs Hurricane Matthew,"This may be a little half-assed since I'm trying to rush it before market close.  Though it could be a much longer-term play than I can see right now.

I started by looking into Lennar Homes as a possible beneficiary of rebuilding after Hurricane Matthew.  However, seeing their inventory levels (~9B) I wondered if they could be a good short.

First, historical...  after Hurricane Wilma hit in 10/23/05, Lennar closed up on 10/24/05 (~3.5%) after the hurricane.  And if you look at today's call volume, the call to put ratio is about 2,434/129, so people seem to be expecting the same to happen.  

The following 3 days, the price dropped.  And that is as far as I'll take the historical.

Now for the real interesting part, at least to my untrained eye...

Looking at their last couple annual reports, their reserve for self insurance has decreased from 108M in 2013 down to 58M in 2016.  It makes sense from an accounting standpoint because there hasn't been much damage from hurricanes in the last 10 years or so.  (Going off of the list of the most expensive hurricanes to hit the US, the last Cat 5 to hit Florida was Hurricane Wilma in 2005.)

So, they are self-insured up to a certain dollar amount (which I can't find in the 10-Qs), and then they have insurance above that which covers a certain amount (again not disclosed, or I just don't know where to look).  Any help on where to find that info if it is available would be greatly appreciated.

One more thing, small insider sale of 20,000 shares reported on 10/3 from a family trust.  The guy still holds 450k shares, so it's not a big factor in this.

Any thoughts?  Tear it up please.  Looking for some insight or someone to just burst the high I am riding on.  I'm not Mikey and I don't have a fake eye, and I've got maybe 6 months of actively trading (losing money) so, I'm looking for holes to be poked in this before I buy puts tomorrow.",1

Softbank's the co-owner of Yahoo! Japan with Yahoo! and along side... Yahoo! they own a big chunk of Alibaba. Makes you wonder why Sprint wasn't used as a vehicle to buy Yahoo! doesn't it?

## Recent financials 

It's not a pretty picture. Sales down and losing money. If you look into the details, their capex is higher than their operational profit. So for now, they are in investment mode. But how long with that last?

|March-end|2016A|2015A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $32bn | $35bn | 
|Operating +/- | $0.3bn | -$1.9bn | 
|Net loss | -$2.0bn | -$3.3bn |

aside: I've only got 2 years, since they changed the year end to March.

## Competition

They describe the usual suspects, if you read the annual report

&gt; We believe that the market for wireless services has been and will continue to be characterized by competition on the basis of price, the types of services and devices offered and quality of service. We compete with a number of wireless carriers, including three other national wireless companies: AT&amp;T, Verizon Wireless and T-Mobile.

They go on to bemoan the maturity of the market, the lack of growth and the high subsidies competitors give for phones. There is surprisingly little mention of new technologies undermining the entire business model.

If we compare their metrics, last 12 months, it's in the same boat as T-Mobile. Perhaps the old fixed telephone business of AT&amp;T and Verizon are still huge cash flow machines. Oh to be a quasi-monopoly.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Sprint Corp | $32,165M | 26% | -ve
Verizon Communications Inc. | $130,115M | 35% | 94%
T-Mobile Us Inc | $33,917M | 24% | 6%
AT&amp;T Inc. | $162,265M | 33% | 14%
Centurylink Inc | $17,829M | 38% | 7%
Level 3 Communications, Inc. | $8,222M | 32% | 42%
Charter Communications Inc | $13,653M | 38% | 14%

## Cash / Debt?

Sprint Corp has $31,873M of net debt. That is 3.9x it's latest operating profit, rather high, though as a telecom operator, it's not a major worry. Though remember $T is on 2.3x and $VZ on 2.1x. 

# Dividends
With debts like that, it's no surprise that Sprint Corp is not forecast to pay a dividend this year.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $4.69 for Sprint Corp and their recommendation to clients is _Hold_. That implies a downside of 30% to their target.

# Valuation

And then it comes to the metrics. Sure there is a reasonable free cashflow yield but there is no dividend and no earnings this year. 

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/s/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
S | $26,502M | -ve | 5% | 0% | 10%
VZ | $204,916M | 13x | 4% | 5% | 20%
TMUS.O | $37,900M | 35x | 20% | 0% | 18%
T | $240,912M | 14x | 8% | 5% | 22%
CTL | $14,758M | 11x | 0% | 8% | 21%
LVLT.K | $16,402M | 27x | 10% | 0% | 29%
CHTR.O | $72,359M | 75x | 31% | 0% | 17%

So how on earth do you value it? Earnings for the year to March 2017 are expected to be a loss of 16c a shares, having lost 42c a share in year to March 2016. Jump forward a year and it's forecast to be break even. 

I'm lost... do I flip to ""Price to Book Value"" or ""Price to Sales"" as a metric? And assume they'll get back to profit in a few years and the discounts will close? 

Or imagine I'm patient and I'm willing to wait 5 years. Say I want 10% return a year for my patience. Means I'd expect the stock to hit $11. If it's trading on a pedestrian 15x at the time the earnings would need to be 70 cents a share. i.e. just under $3bn of earnings. Okay, it's not impossible, but I can't say I'm confident.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 47% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -24%. In the background, sales fell 1% in the quarter, and the reported losses widened.

But up 47%. Go figure!

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, there was a lot of talk about trying to maintain revenues, cut costs and aim for cash flow breakeven this year. But it was hard to identify any good news. Just a lack of bad news. Which of course is good ;)

So is it a good investment? I just can't tell. Seems like a pretty speculative investment to me. Sorry.

16-10-06,566dod,Hurricane Matthew and $DB.,"DB has a large portfolio of both home and auto INSURANCE in Florida.

If this is actually as bad as it could be, some saying it may be a strong 4//low 5 (Think Andrew), DB might have to take a few billion in losses.  After Hurricane Andrew - a lot of companies went straight Bankrupt from the losses and the entire FL. insurance industry had to be re-configured.  Shit, even State Farm almost went under and more or less totally pulled out of the state for most products for a while.

Quick DD from the googles yields a bunch of agents that write DB products for home//auto.

""...agent and is licensed to write Deutsche Bank Auto and Home insurance policies in Florida""

No position - but if it strengthens to a Cat. 5 today I might go short.

Edit:  Since 2008 -- DB has expanded operations significantly in Florida and it is now it's largest Corporate US HQ//Operations outside of Wall Street.  
http://www.flgov.com/gov-scott-announces-deutsche-bank-expansion-in-jacksonville-2/ 

         DB had a ton of houses that were, and still are, vacant due to the 2008 crash.  Losses on these properties would be the mos devastating.  ""Documentaries would air on evening television featuring German news anchors driving around parts of dilapidated neighborhoods in Florida, pointing to vacant home after vacant home and declaring ""owned by Deutsche Bank""

The main critique that most people seem to have with Wealthfront is its 0.25% fee. A lot of people argue that you can easily use Vanguard to mimic what Wealthfront does at a much lower cost.

For my own situation, I was able to generate a bunch of referrals from my college buddies who wanted to get started with hands-off investing. So, now, I have more ""free investing"" than I could see myself using up in the mid-term. For example, let's say I have $25,000 in the account but $120,000 of fee-free services available (not real numbers, but an example).

Would ANYBODY argue that moving my money away from Wealthfront would be better than keeping it in? In order words, do you think there is something other than the 0.25% fee that makes Wealthfront a bad option?

16-10-07,56adt8,"A $25bn Snapchat IPO? Look at FB / GOOG's IPO data for insight.","Here's the [WSJ story](http://www.wsj.com/articles/snapchat-parent-working-on-ipo-that-could-value-company-at-25-billion-or-more-sources-1475778314) with the following figures:

|Snapchat|2015A|2016E|2017E|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $60m | $250-350m | ~$1bn |

## GOOG

So what did Google look like in it's early years?

|Google|1999A|2000A|2001A|2002A|2003A|2004A|2005A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $0m | $19m | $86m | $440m | $1,466m|$3,189m | $6,139m|

The IPO was in August 2004. It was values at $23bn in the IPO.

## FB

Next let's look at Facebook, whose IPO was in May 2012 valuing the business at $81bn

|Facebook|2009A|2010A|2011A|2012A|2013A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $777m | $1,974m | $3,711m | $5,089m | $7,872m|

## Well?

Both Facebook and Google were profitable at the time of their IPOs and they had shown an acceleration in their revenue growth. This got them 5 to 10x next year's forecast revenue, and 7 to 16x current year's forecast revenue. 

For me the key is proof that the topline in accelerating. Google's top line accelerated every year until the great recession. Facebook's stopped immediately after the IPO, crashing the stock, until the topline started ramping again in 2013.

## A Rocket or Rock?

If Snapchat's sales follow this path, then a $25bn will be a steal. If not, it'll be another Twitter.

|Snapchat|2015A|2016E|2017E|2018E|2019E|2020E|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $60m | $300m | $1bn |$2bn |$3.5bn |$6bn |




## EDIT:

If you're curious on the stats for Twitter, it IPOed in Nov 2013. It's sales had been accelerating. The business was valued at $14bn, i.e. 10x the forecast year's sales.

|Twitter|2010A|2011A|2012A|2013A|2014A|2015A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $28m | $106m | $317m | $665m | $1,403m|$2,218m|

And for 2014, things were fine with sales more than doubling. Sadly it was 2015 that the growth slowed. ",235

16-10-07,569juq,How to actually make decent profits off of natural occurrences with little to no risks.,"TL;DR: Use Google Trends in order to know about events before the market picks up.

-----

Be resourceful. There's this tool called [Google Trends](https://www.google.com/trends/). With it, you can see the number of times something is searched on google.

One reliable way of being ahead of the market, is for you to use Google trends, and find the stories before they surface.

Look at Mr. Matthew for example, the first news stories about it were in September 18th [Here](http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/tropical-depression-12-karl-atlantic-caribbean/60111529) Maybe even before actually. 

How could anyone have actually read some random obscure weather news website in the 18th for no reason whatsoever? No one is expected to do it, which is why ~~we~~ I use Google Trends.

If you search for ""Hurricane"" in trends, then limit your search to the US, and on a time-frame of just the 30 most recent days, you will realize that Google Trends picked up on Mr Matthew on the 29th, by increasing the ""Search Score"" for ""Hurricane"" from 2 to 6. The ""Normal""/Default ""Search Score"" should be 2-4. Anything above that means that it's being picked up by the media, hence calling people's attention on Google.

If we look at a any Insurer, we can see that on the 28th their stock started to go down, then more on the 29th, then even more on the 30th, etc. If you had used google trends, seen the Search Score increasing from 2 to 6, then looked into it, you'd know that a storm being called ""One of the strongest hurricanes to possibly hit the US in years"" was possibly coming to the US.[Here](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3815223/The-Latest-Hurricane-Matthew-grows-Category-2-storm.html), [Here](http://gazette.com/matthew-strengthens-into-category-5-hurricane-in-caribbean/article/feed/404326), etc. you can see many places calling it one of the possibly most devastating hurricanes in the last decade. 

If you'd seen that there was a level 5 Hurricane coming to the US on the 28th, your profit would've been more than 20% On stocks (Assuming you shorted $UVE) , and MUCH more on options. Just by checking for ""Hurricane"" on Google Trends. 

In case it had dispersed, you'd have lost close to nothing, since the market never priced it in on the 30th (Which is when the trend score went from 2 to 12). the 30th was also this company's highest point in quite a while, making it a somewhat-safe short even though it's kind of a gamble (As seen that the hurricane could take a completely different direction)

To add, you can do this with other countries as well, and with other subjects. EG: School Shooting, and keep the trend timescale on 4Hours. If you see a spike, buy SWHC, etc. Some fag on /r/algotrading can probably code something that warns you of this kind of things daily, and maybe even executes trades for you. Just don't forget, if you code something that does this, PM it to me. Thanks.
----

I won't lie, I never kept track of this, but I definitely will start checking on for ""Hurricane"", ""Earthquake"" and ""Natural Disaster"" from now on. A safe 20% position doesn't come by too often.

Godspeed.",223

not bad, right? this is just the beginning. once it is legalized in canada, the share prices will go up 10 times in the next few years. this is nothing... it's the birth of a whole new industry and market. currently the medical marijuana market is valued at around $150 million a year... the black market for marijuana is valued at over $4 billion a year. just in canada. i read an article on the globe and mail yesterday that said the combined market of medical/recreational for marijuana could be valued as much as $7.4 BILLION after a few years of legalization. that's not even including the fact that a lot of canadian medical marijuana producers just got approval for selling their marijuana to other countries. CGC just started shipping pot to germany and brazil... the german market will be even bigger than the canadian market!

[KMI hourly chart](http://i.imgur.com/TlR8P1C.png)... notice its in an up channel and has strong support at the 50 DMA. It touched the 50 DMA again today and has made a solid move up off of it again. I expect this move up to continue and along with my expectation the market will rally monday after the debates (assuming Hillary doesn't faint) it should give it an extra boost. GL

Its price is at $0.020 right now. It started at $0.025. Good catalyst news came out like new mining site discovered. Went up to 0.035 then someone started selling at 0.020 and it went down to 0.020. Then it went down further to 0.015 then fluctuating right now. 0.020 right now. This is what I am doing, which u can cogitate for future reference for ur own stocks.

I had bought at 0.025. Now, because of someone trying to hold the price down below that level, it is difficult to sell at 0.03. So, I put order to sell those stocks at 0.025, willing to lose commission money. Then, I borrowed $3000 from the bank (20% interest per year, which I can easily make by 0.005 increase in 1 transaction), I put order to buy at 0.015. I am not really trying to buy it; I am just trying to increase the bid volume at that price. (Ridiculously lots of people trying to buy THAT STOCK with new mining site at THAT PRICE.) The effect I am trying to pull is that, ""too many people are trying to buy at that price"". Meaning, the stock not being sold so well at that price level. And if people just try to buy &amp; sell at 0.020 only, they lose commission money. If the price goes up to 0.025 and people sell, I recover my original money. (Minus commission fee, but it's like paying blinds in poker. Nothing to dwell on.) If I do buy at 0.015 (not trying to do that though), then I sell at 0.02 and make 25% profit easily.

Cogitate on what I do for your future reference. If it works, good example. If it doesn't work, learn from it.",0

16-10-07,56boae,Why Samsung shares hit a new record high,"Reasons why Samsung hit a new record high:

1. The biggest factor: Elliott, a hedge fund management firm led by billionaire Elliott Singer, proposed a new management plan for Samsung, as well as a Nasdaq stock listing. This could boost Samsung's valuation in excess of 30% according to analysts and could boost investment into Samsung. Samsung stated that it will consider Elliott's proposal. 

2. Second biggest factor: RAM prices have hit a peak for 2016 and is expected to go even higher in 2017/2018. Many analysts are now recommending Korean ETFs like EWY. This has also boosted the share prices of other Korean electronics companies like SK Hynix. 

3. Samsung's mobile division is making up less and less of its overall profits. Quartz did an impressive analysis on this new trend:
http://qz.com/802147/why-samsung-electronics-ssnfl-stock-price-just-hit-an-all-time-high-as-galaxy-not-7-phones-keep-exploding/

I was far too drunk and high to wrap up a new post last night, as of now the market is digesting the Employment Situation with a Nonfarm Payroll miss of 156k actual jobs vs the consensus estimate of 168k.

**Recap from previous post:**

A record influx of [Robinhood Gold users](http://imgur.com/a/3i47f) with their newfound trading abilities flooded after hours and premarket trading of $MU and $DRI following their earnings release.  IV was over 80% for the weeklies prior to $MU’s earnings release which rewarded premium sellers the most.  [I handled the IV crush like a boss](http://imgur.com/a/PU0TB).  $YUM let out a wet fart reporting lower than expected revenue while also lowering future expectations to only end down 1.33%, but leaving their chart looking as pretty as a [blue waffle](http://bfy.tw/PbF).  Boring, non-yolo earnings week, but the week ahead kicks off the next earnings season.

This week’s fed speaker rhetoric and economic reports like Monday’s Motor Vehicle Sales has further cemented the Market’s certainty of a 2016 rate hike.  Bearing the brunt of this interest rate news are the retard clown cars of the leveraged ETF space, gold mining 3x bulls $NUGT and $JNUG.  If you bought at last Friday’s opening highs you are currently down a whopping 43.5% and ridiculous 48.4% respectively.  Even with a disappointing ADP report Wednesday, the market was not convinced a Non-Farm Payroll miss will reduce the likelihood of a .25% federal funds increase. From yesterday to today the rate hike probability at the FOMC meeting November 2nd increased from [84.5%](http://imgur.com/a/UtPvP) to [89.7%](http://imgur.com/a/l7EtW).  While counter-intuitive, futures contract of the dollar are currently trading down as precious metals are currently up.  Even so, gold fell below [critical 200 EMA support](http://imgur.com/a/2K3sh).  Any potential relief to the $JNUG &amp; $NUGT longs is looking brief and limited.  Just because the road cone you’re getting fucked with got pulled out of your ass doesn’t mean your situation has really improved much.  [Good post on it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/566fvu/to_the_people_still_bagholding_jnug_i_got_some/).  On the flip side, a bet on $15 strike Faggot’s Delight^^TM [$NUGT puts earlier this week](http://imgur.com/a/LjKbm) would have had you up as much as 7,100%.  Playing options on leveraged ETFs is like trying to pick up wads of cash in front of a steamroller while blackout drunk and high on cocaine.  The Japanese Large Manufacturers Index mentioned last week came in over consensus and the Nikkei 225 Index was up over 1% from previous close on 10/3/16.  The Nikkei continued with a strong week of trading.

As for Biotech Catalysts, $CLDX saw a jump of 10% before leveling off as investors shot some precum for the still upcoming 10/8/16 ESMO conference.  $CERU hasn’t done much on thin volume all week.

**Earnings:**

Date | Ticker | When | Comment
---|---|----|----
10/11/16 | AA | AMC | Earnings season starts up again with Alcoa.  A strong USD headwind can wreck the shitter of the metal manufacturer, but strong positive reaction from investors might keep pushing the stock higher to end the last quarter of 2016 green while setting the tone for 2017.
10/11/16 | CUDA | AMC | 4 out of the last 5 earnings releases saw software security CUDA trading as violently as a drunk blonde’s mood swings.  Consistently beating recent EPS and Revenue estimates, CUDA is still trying to rebound from large earnings drops in 2015.
10/13/16* | AMD | AMC | Quintessential holding of the ultra-faggot’s portfolio, CPU &amp; GPU maker $AMD tentatively reporting earning on this date according to Estimize &amp; Google Finance.  Meanwhile, NASDAQ and Earnings Whisper are claiming a 10/20/16 After Market Close release.  In either case, $AMD longs were finally rewarded during 2016 as innovation and demand for components pulled this security out of penny stock territory.  Competition from $NVDA and commodity prices reacting to interest rate talk are real concerns heading into earnings, however another beat and guidance raise might give $AMD longs and Faggot’s Delight gamblers another nut to bust.  A big move is more likely than not IMO, but play it wrong and you’ll sound silly blaming an internet stranger named SasquatchCunt.
10/14/16 | JPM, WFC, C, PNC | BMO | 4 Investment &amp; Banking giants are reporting before open on this day.  $WFC still shaking off the sting of their fraudulent practices while $PNC and $JPM poised to continue higher especially cashing in on the prospects of a guaranteed rate hike to end 2016.  For max YOLO play the whole Financials sector with 3x leveraged ETFs FAS or FAZ, both of which have options available.

**Economic Calendar:**

Date | Event | Time | Comments / Implications
---|---|----|----
10/12&amp;13/16 | China Economic Activity| Multiple | The 10/12 Chinese economic report are trade related while 10/13’s report is the inflation rate.  Worth keeping an eye on to see what the world’s #2 economy is up to.
10/12/16 | FOMC Minutes | 2:00 PM | All eyes and ears on Wall Street’s bottom bitch, Janet Yellen and the Fed, as they release FOMC meeting minutes.  Per Bloomberg “The FOMC has changed dramatically in the transparency of its operations. It now discloses policy changes at the end of each meeting. Historically, the Fed used to keep investors guessing about policy changes and Fed officials did not appear on the speaking circuit as frequently as they do now.”  Placing bets on gold, volatility, and options on leveraged instruments are a fun way to lose money during these releases.  Recent FOMC Minutes have seen market wide price swings that put a lot of earnings releases to shame.
10/13/16 | EIA Petroleum Status Report| 11:00 AM | [This WSB short bus rider](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/560pks/yofuckinglo_investing_a_private_loan_cash_advance/) says he is all in and then some on DWTI.  Tune in this time next week to see if he joins WSB hall of fame or his asshole rip after leverage decay gives him a brutal butt fucking.
10/13/16 | Jobless Claims | 8:30 AM | Not of much importance this week unless a huge miss or beat is reported.  Following the FOMC minutes this report won’t tell the market anything it doesn’t already know.
10/13/16 | EIA Natural Gas Report | 10:30 AM | Running alongside crude oil, Natural Gas has had a very strong reversal from recent lows.  UGAZ and DGAZ are the preferred ETNs of WSB faggots during these reports.  Watch during release to see how /NG trades, then see which ETN is moon bound and which one is getting a deep dicking.
10/14/16 | Producer Price Index &amp; Retail Sales | 8:30 AM | Per Bloomberg “The PPI measures prices at the producer level before they are passed along to final consumers. A portion of the inflation at the producer level gets passed through to the consumer price index (CPI). By tracking price pressures in the pipeline, investors can anticipate inflationary consequences in coming months.”  A real concern around whether or not an interest rate hike is feasible is how much inflation the economy is seeing.  Watch the dollar index as these reports get released.  Equally important, the retail sales report is a preferred method of judging the health of consumer spending in our consumption based economy.  Watch the report release and look at past releases to see a trend.  Connect the dots from here into earnings season with retail stocks if this report comes out strong or weak.

**FDA Catalyst Calendar:**

Date | Ticker | Stage | Half Assed Catalyst Explanation &amp; Comment
---|---|----|----
10/11/16 | RNN | Phase 1/2 | Penny stock releasing interim data on drug RX-3117 for pancreatic and advanced bladder cancer.  This is said to be occurring during the same ESMO conference discussed in last week’s catalysts post.  $0.215 as of the time I am writing with highs over $1.00 seen in 2014.  Watch for PPS swings and read their release to determine if a YOLO on this biotech is a good call.  
10/14/16 | EGLT | PDUFA | An Advisory Committee Meeting in August 4th voted 18-1 recommending approval on Egalet-001 Abuse-Deterrent Morphine.  Per their press release “Based on the committees' votes, Egalet anticipates, if approved, the label for ARYMO ER will describe the product's abuse-deterrent properties that are expected to reduce, but not totally prevent, abuse of the drug when the tablets are manipulated. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of its advisory committees, but will consider their guidance during the review of the NDA for ARYMO ER. The FDA Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date for a decision is October 14, 2016.”  Recent insider selling has resulted with investors reacting and shares sliding 5% in 10/6/16 trading.  If you want to go long, reaction to unrelated insider selling is a gift to anyone wanting to buy the dip before this meeting.  If the insider selling is indicative of anything other than a follow up to the overwhelming 8/6/16 approval, a short bet could be rewarding.

I got a suggestion to include upcoming IPOs, but after The Trade Desk abortion I’m just passing along the link so you can check it out yourself.  Start a conversation!  If you think there are moves to be made with under or overpriced valuations heading into the IPO of these stocks.

I'm hoping to also do a little more evaluation of insider buying and selling, sorting said activity my dollar volume, then taking a look at stock technicals, fundamentals, and upcoming catalysts if there are any.  It's a lot of work trying to connect the dots on what is most likely a non-event, but I'm still convinced it's worth looking at after the recent $TPX inside sell.  That stock has still yet to recover from the unannounced lowering of earnings guidance.

I have about 150k in a non-registered trading account in Canada. My current mix of investments are predominantly stocks. I have accrued about 40% return over the last 6 years and think it's time to either protect the returns (maybe with derivatives), or sell and invest in a couch potato option. Or if you have any other suggestions please let me know. I will also mention that my TFSA is maxed and I have ongoing contributions into my RRSP. Looking to keep these funds non-reg.

1) Does it make sense to buy some put options against by current holdings? Yes it will cost premiums now, but I am concerned about a market correction in the near future. I am only 25 but I do rely on these dividends to help with my living expenses. Are there any derivative strategies to consider?

2) Alternatively - I have considered selling everything and putting the proceeds into a low MER fund (mawer seems to be a good bet), or follow an etf couch potato option.

How can something be both tied to an underlying index and traded on the open market? In that case it seems like it be possible to have a 'flash crash' style price jump based on a series of NUGT stop losses even if the market for gold/oz was barely moving? So how 'tied' to the actual commodity is it? 

Also I spent most of the day staring at a screen showing the price of gold vs JDST and noticed that the price followed it but not exactly, like at one point the price of gold had dropped like $2-3/oz and JDST stayed about the same, other times it was more volatile

# Description
Capital One is a financial services holding company with 3 divisions:

* Credit Card, which consists of its domestic consumer and small business card lending, and the international card lending businesses in Canada and the United Kingdom; 
* Consumer Banking, which consists of its branch-based lending and deposit gathering activities for consumers and small businesses, national deposit gathering, national auto lending and consumer home loan lending and servicing activities; 
* Commercial Banking, which consists of its lending, deposit gathering and treasury management services to commercial real estate, and commercial and industrial customers, and Other, which includes management of its corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management.

Less than 25 years old and it's the fourth largest issuer of Visa and MasterCard credit cards in the United States.

## Recent financials 

The topline's been flat for a few years, but in the current financial environment, what financial services firm has had a good top-line? As a result, the EPS line's not been exciting either. Though at least we've the crutch of the Divie to hold onto :)

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $23bn | $22bn | $22bn | $21bn | $16bn|
|EPS | $7.07 | $7.59 | $6.89 | $6.11 | $6.76|
|DPS | $1.50 | $1.20 | $0.95 | $0.20 | $0.20|


If you are wondering which unit is the driver... well it's Cards.

|2015|Cards|Consumer|Commercial|Other|Total|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Net income | $2,354m | $1,034m | $570m | $54m | $4,012m|
|% | 59% | 26% | 14% | 1% | n/a|

## Competition

It's the usual suspects when it comes to competition. With the Cards business up against the Visa/Mastercards of other banks, and then there is Amex and Discovery. The Consumer and Commercial units are chasing deposits and offering loans in competition with every other bank or finance brand. 

Looking at returns on equity, they are at the bottom of the class... alongside poor old Citi :(

|Companies|Latest Sales|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|
Capital One Financial Corp. | $21,636M  | 8%
American Express Company | $34,567M  | 26%
Citigroup Inc | $57,601M |  7%
Discover Financial Services | $8,243M |  21%
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. | $53,259M |  10%
Synchrony Financial | $13,936M |  17%
U.S. Bancorp | $12,746M |  14%
Wells Fargo &amp; Co | $51,206M  | 12%

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $79.11 for Capital One Financial Corp. and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 8% to their target.

# Valuation

Wow are the valuations bunched. ~10x earnings, 2% yield and low single digit growth. Feels like I'm looking at Utilities or Telecom stocks. ;)

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/cof/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
COF | $37,404M | 10x | 4% | 2% | 18%
AXP | $57,219M | 11x | 8% | 2% | 6%
C | $142,567M | 11x | 3% | 1% | 4%
DFS | $22,874M | 10x | 8% | 2% | 13%
JPM | $245,145M | 12x | 4% | 3% | 5%
SYF | $22,508M | 10x | 6% | 1% | 11%
USB | $75,119M | 14x | 5% | 2% | 10%
WFC | $227,958M | 11x | 7% | 3% | 7%

# Dividends
Capital One Financial Corp. is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.60 per share which compares to a forecast EPS of $7.17. So plenty of room there to increase the payout. Though they've a share buyback program too. 

They are proud to point out that $100 in COF have growth to $180 from 2010 to 2015. When the S&amp;P only grow to $163, and the rest of Finance to $150.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 13% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -4%. That's against a backdrop on net interest income off 1% and net income off 4% in the last 6 months.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, they said

&gt; Compared to 2015, we still expect some improvement in our full year 2016 efficiency ratio, with continuing improvement in 2017.

They also pointed out that the Fed has no objections to an addition $2.5bn buyback. So they aren't one of finance's bad boys. Phew.

So, am I interested? Yes... a little. The valuation is cheap, the management's been buying up loan books, and other assets. Consolidating the sector. They've not been dragged through the mud by Congress. 

But what can drive the growth? Can they increase their returns? I wonder, just wonder if there's better value in some of the smaller more specialist financial services companies.

Anyone?

16-10-08,56eit0,"Let's talk about Tim Sykes","[Tim Sykes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Sykes), if you don't already know, is a ""Penny Stock Expert"" He's done a relatively unsuccessful AMA [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23og03/i_am_timothy_sykes_ask_me_anything/) but his popularity is hard to ignore, so let's talk about how he makes money and why you should NOT follow his trades. 

First of all what is a pump and dump?
A pump and dump is a form of market manipulation, buying when shares are low and convincing other people through marketing, chat rooms, etc. To buy. Once the crowd has gotten in, you sell. Tim Sykes does this in a pyramid-like way, telling his premium followers first, his paid subscribers, then the chat room. It becomes very cult-like, as you need to become  closer to Tim (through money of course) to access the information sooner. His cult of personality is HUGE. He'll do chats and respond to every single person. He'll put out and ad and answer EVERY comment. This charisma and attention is evidence of someone who way back in the early days of the internet would go into chat rooms and convince unwitting people to buy stock. He is very persuading.

Tim's strategy works because the stocks have a low float. Relatively small trades move the share price significantly. If he was making buy or sell recommendations on Large cap stocks you would NEVER see the returns he brags about.

Remember investing is not gambling. Have a sound thesis for your investment policy statement that fits your risk profile. Beware the volatility and illiquidity of microcap stocks. And NEVER listen to Tim Sykes.",9

# **WEEK AHEAD: Politics, earnings and other issues heating up for markets next week** - *[(CNBC.com)](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/07/politics-earnings-and-other-issues-heating-up-for-markets-next-week.html)*

*****
&gt; ### Investors will have a lot to digest in the week ahead, ranging from politics to earnings to events in Europe.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### ""Given the elections, that will obviously take a lot of the headlines in the next few weeks. … The election will put a lot of volatility in the market,"" said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer, equities, at Charles Schwab Investment Management.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### Right at the start to the week, traders will watch Sunday night's presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. This second debate between the two candidates is scheduled for 9 p.m., ET, at Washington University in St. Louis and will take the form of a town meeting.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### ""I don't believe a Clinton win is completely priced into the markets,"" said Brian Muench, vice president of investment management at Allianz Investment Management. He expects a pullback in stocks by the end of the year, and polls showing a tighter race between the two candidates could contribute to the decline. 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### The potential number of market-moving events only heats up as the week progresses. 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### Earnings season unofficially kicks off Tuesday with Alcoa's quarterly results, and the meeting minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's September meeting are due Wednesday. New York Fed President Bill Dudley is also scheduled to speak that day.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### The climax comes Friday with earnings from major banks Citigroup,JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### ""For me, the real driver for markets the end of this year should really be third-quarter earnings,"" said Chris Wright, ultra high net worth investment strategist at UBS Wealth Management. ""We'd be looking for quite strong earnings growth in the third quarter given we've got a fairly benign third quarter.""
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### Retail sales are due for release on the same day, and Fed Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to speak that afternoon on ""Macroeconomic research after the crisis.""
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### ""We'll be watching consumer data next week just to confirm we think the consumer is in a good position here,"" said Sean Lynch, co-head of global equity strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### ""Earnings and the retail sales and any Fed speakers will be closely watched as to how they digest (Friday's jobs) release,"" he said.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### The September nonfarm payrolls report showed creation of 156,000 for the month, below expectations, while the unemployment rate ticked up to 5 percent. Average hourly wages rose 6 cents to an annualized rate of 2.6 percent.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### U.S. stocks closed slightly lower Friday after the jobs report and snapped a three-week win streak. The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 2,153.74, weighed by a 5.3 percent decline in the REITs sector.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### ""While we're still two jobs reports away from the Fed meeting, there probably could have been some political implications for this,"" said David Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Global Asset Management. But the data ""wasn't strong enough to crow about if you're a Democrat, and it wasn't weak enough to bad mouth if you're a Republican. It won't have a lot of effect on Fed expectations."" 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### The data reduced already low expectations for a November rate hike and added to general expectations the Fed will raise rates in December.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: Regardless of election outcome, S&amp;P 500 advances 72.2% of the time**
&gt; For all the heated discussion, debate, worrying, slicing and dicing of numbers, the actual presidential election outcome appears to have little bearing on S&amp;P 500 performance in November and December. Since 1944 election-year Novembers have been up 55.6% of the time with an average gain of 0.6% and election-year Decembers have been up 83.3% of the time with an average 1.4% advance. The two-month combo of November and December is collectively up 72.2% of the time with an average gain of 2.0%. Regardless who wins, history still favors a typical yearend rally.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: S&amp;P 500 deviates from incumbent party victory pattern""**
&gt;With just two trading days in the record books, the fourth quarter of 2016 is off to a bumpy start. As of today’s close S&amp;P 500 is down 0.82% and appears to be casting its vote early, against the incumbent party’s candidate Hillary Clinton. Perhaps it is voting for Republican candidate Donald Trump or maybe for Gary Johnson of the Libertarian party. Admittedly it is too early in October to make such a call however; it is notable that S&amp;P 500 has already deviated from its typical path in October compared to past incumbent party victories.

###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://66.media.tumblr.com/03507a11cd45ad760cc5aff6ed7013ab/tumblr_inline_oejm9btdi51spdppr_500.jpg))

&gt; In the above chart, S&amp;P 500 performance in October is plotted for “All Years,” “Election Years,” “Incumbent Victories,” “Incumbent Party Defeats” and “2016.” Should S&amp;P 500 continue to track the Incumbent Party Defeat pattern, weakness is likely to persist until near the end of October before a modest rally ensues, but still fails to return to positive territory.

I have a close friend, who makes quite a bit of money as a salaried employee in the UK. He is both a UK and USA citizen, though he rarely comes to the States. He has no income in the US, though has quite a bit of investments, all in taxable accounts in the USA. He's trying to figure out a way to get some, if not all of money into non-taxable (IRA, 401(k)) type of accounts, without having to report income in the United States, with the exception of the sale of stocks. 





I am not quite sure how to advise him, who turns to me for a lot of Financial advice. By the way, he has been to many major accounting firms over the past ten years living in the UK. Even had a legal battle and won against one of the worlds largest firms because of their errors with his taxes. No one can seem to get it right for him. There's been an enormous amount of frustration having to pay insane amounts of taxes at the state level (In the USA), all for not filing a simple piece of paperwork that states he no longer lives there, another major accounting firm did not tell him he needed to file.





I am thinking that he could open a US-based corporation, and then pay into a 401(k) as some form of income and or profit-sharing. At the end of the day the corporation would show no profit or no income, except for the sale of the equities that he currently owns in United States.  Another thought would be forming a trust with his nephews, he's not able to have children, and is not really interested in having children. He is planning on leaving his money to these nephews BTW.",2

High-profile investors also e-mailed Hawkins, who forwarded the messages to his CEO and the board.""",30

He's watched a video showing research and data that shows prior to each election for the last 20 years we've had an economic bubble collapse. The most recent housing market collapse had a global impact.

If this bubble bursts this November it states we will see a global economic downfall worse than the recession and great depression.

16-10-09,56lwkm,"ReReddit Open Yale Course | Week 6 | Guest Lecture: Asset Allocation, Market Timing, and Security Selection","Hi everyone,

This week will be pretty light. 

###Introduction
David Swensen, Yale University’s Chief Investment Officer, starts his lecture by referring to an article published in 2008: Andrew Bary, ‘Crash Course’ Barron’s (10 November 2008). In this article, Bary criticises the approach of the three richest Ivy League universities not having invested enough in liquid stocks and bonds. A more recent article noted that [roughly 82%](https://www.greycourt.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/WhitePaperNo55-YaleVersusNorway.pdf) of Yale’s endowment is illiquid. Throughout the lecture, Swensen explains the rationale why the university allocates assets the way it does.
	
###Study Materials
- Watch | [Lecture Week 6 – David Swensen](https://youtu.be/wRdx7kVNQ_E)
- Read | Bary, ‘[Crash Course](http://www.barrons.com/articles/SB122610188023510005)’ Barron’s (10 November 2008).
- Read | Chambers, Dimons, and Ilmanen, [The Norway Model](http://www.ssrn.com/abstract=1936806) SSRN (2011).
- Do | [Multiple Choice Quiz](http://oyc.yale.edu/sites/default/files/ECON252_06_020211_MC.pdf) 

This weeks’ lecture does not have any study materials. Nonetheless, it makes sense to read the Barron’s article. Further, ‘The Norway Model’ shows an alternative way of managing financial assets. The Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global is considered the largest fund globally. Its approach is quite different from the Yale model, and I figured you might enjoy seeing alternative approaches to managing large endowments.

For requests, contributions, or anything related to the course - send an e-mail to yoc.reddit [at] gmail.com or send a PM to /u/indefinitely_not.

16-10-10,56pce7,DVAX to the Moon!,"Any of you faggots want to lose some money with me? Dynavax is awaiting FDA approval for a Hep-B vaccine it has.  It was denied once before citing a lack of sufficient clinical trials.  They've since done more trials that have shown mostly good results.  Effectiveness seems higher than competing products and the dosage can be applied over a shorter time period improving compliance.  The FDA cancelled a scheduled review meeting:
https://www.thestreet.com/story/13693559/1/dynavax-technologies-dvax-stock-plummets-on-cancelled-fda-meeting.html

analsysis showed that most meetings cancelled with similar language saw the drug be subsequently rejected, but that in some instances the drug was approved. The FDA later submitted questions to DVAX that DVAX considered 'expected' 
http://investors.dynavax.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1564590-16-25554&amp;CIK=1029142

They also recently posted a job for a person to oversee marketing the drug:
https://careers-dynavax.icims.com/jobs/1845/product-manager%2c-promotions-%286-month-contract%29/job

The two facts above would imply that they expect approval. The argument for denial also seems strange.  The last time around they won 13-1 on efficacy and lost 8-5-1 on safety. Not because the drug was considered unsafe, but due to a lack of numbers for a novel treatment. The most recent study showed the same effectiveness and the safety numbers seemed fine. It also added about 8k patients. Slightly worse than the competing drug, but allegedly still within the same margin of error.
http://hepatitisnewstoday.com/2016/06/14/new-efficacy-data-on-hepatitis-b-vaccine-in-adults-with-type-2-diabetes/

http://seekingalpha.com/article/3819486-dynavax-dominate-hepatitis-b-market

They also have another product in the pipeline that might not be entirely worthless, SD-101, that had some decent news over the weekend.
http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/DVAX/2992119299x0x911075/352CAC83-7A2C-4131-B194-48A8F381EFA9/DVAX_News_2016_10_9_General_Releases.pdf

My guess is the cancelled ADCOMM means that the FDA considers the case to be unambiguous and no meeting necessary. In most cases that has meant a denial, but in this case it may signal an obvious approval. Am I being an autist here? I don't see them losing on effectiveness since they won on that last time. I also don't see a case for losing on safety, unless I'm misinterpreting the numbers somehow? At worst we'll make it all back on JNUG, amirite? The up/downside seems worth the YOLO here. Back when the market thought this would be approved the stock was over $30, so an approval should send it at least that high.",12

3.) I pulled up the public record of the deed and confirmed that the delinquent tax payer is the current owner.
4.) Went over the rules of the auction and have money set aside 
5.) I know what the starting bid is and also am well aware that if a property has been applied for homestead that half the assessed value will be added to the opening bid
6.) I am in the process of calling a title company and doing a municipal lien search along with a title search
7.) confirmed that there are Hoa monthly dues on the property and am in the process of calling the Hoa to find out if there's an Hoa Lien
8.) Went over comparable prices for properties nearby and decided it is still a good bargain. 
9.) Already looked up options for a quite title process so I can resell the property shortly after needed renovations
9.) Went to check out the property personally and the person still lives there. Property seems to be in good shape.

If so how would I go about this and which funds should I look at?(or other investments that would fit my needs).

BMO EC: Delta Air Lines (DAL)

**Friday**

BMO EC: Citigroup (C), JP Morgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC)

13:30 Fed Chair Yellen scheduled to speak at a conference in Boston

**Commentary**

It’ll be a pretty quiet week for economic data releases. The main focus for this week will be the development between the DOJ and Deutsche Bank, the informal OPEC &amp; non-OPEC meeting in Istanbul, US political developments, and US earnings season. Yellen is also scheduled to speak Friday; although a move in the November meeting is largely off the table, markets are anticipating her thoughts on recent NFP numbers. 

**Deutsche Bank pared earlier pre-market losses.** The stock fell 3% in pre-market trading on the report that no settlement was struck between the DOJ and Deutsche Bank executives. It is now at Friday’s close in pre-market trading.

**Russia has signaled willingness to freeze in cooperation with OPEC countries.** Still, there is much to work out between OPEC itself before non-OPEC members agree definitively to a freeze/cut. Iraq’s oil minister Al-Luaibi has called for increasing oil and natural gas production over the weekend, and there are concerns over Libya’s intention to expand production that may undo much of the cuts agreed upon in Algiers.

**Mexican peso is about 1.4% stronger since the weekend**, reflecting the leaked Trump comments and the second presidential debate. This all points to a falling probability of a Trump victory; FiveThirtyEight has his odds at 18.4% now. Some media outlets are however suggesting that Trump came out the victor, although early polls suggest that 57% thought Clinton won and 34% thought Trump did (compared to 62% and 27% after the first debate, respectively).

**Earnings season is upon us**. Most expect Q3 to be the sixth consecutive quarter that EPS will fall on a YoY basis. Note that many companies have lowered guidance; history suggests that they lower it more than necessary to later beat expectations.

**TWTR shares down 13% pre-market**, as institutional investors of Salesforce are strongly against the proposed deal to buy Twitter for cash and stock. GOOG, AAPL, and DIS have also reportedly walked away from a potential deal.

Incoming pump and dump of oil. Its like black Friday, except for oil producers. They will raise prices with these fake cut talks and pump oil for weeks offset some lost profits during the year with the higher prices. Putin isn't retarded, he will help them raise the price of oil and then quietly let production ramp up alongside the Cartels (OPEC). Then about a month later the market will be ""Over supply fears linger"" and we're back to $35-$45 range by Jan.

aaaaand then we got Trump in office who is going to try to fuck OPEC if they don't want to make a deal to stop squeezing and killing American Oil. It will most likely be a threat along the lines of taxing OPEC imports into America using that money to subsidized American Oil productions (TOOOK ER JOBS) and/or giving US energy companies tax breaks. 

But for now I'm gonna hope oil hits ~$54 and attempt to buy UCO put options.",21

16-10-10,56qwik,(Help!) Confused about investopedia strike price example,"Long story short I am trying to learn about options calls (bullish) and puts (bearish). Investopedia has a strike price example that I cannot understand. Please help! 

If the 2nd option is a put with a 150 strike price and the stock is at 145, Then how could it be out of the money? And then why do they call something that is a put (bearish) a call option? 

Strike Price Example
For example, assume there are two option contracts. One contract is a call option with a $100 strike price. The other contract is a put option with a $150 strike price. The current price of the underlying stock is $145. Both call options are the same; the only difference is the strike price.

The first contract is worth $45, that is, it is in-the-money by $45. This is because the stock is trading $45 higher than the strike price, which is $100. The second contract remains out-of-the-money by only $5. If the price of the underlying asset never reaches the strike price, the option expires worthless. The value of the option is therefore calculated by subtracting the strike price from the current price.

http://247wallst.com/healthcare-business/2016/10/08/crispr-therapeutics-prepares-for-ipo/

Questions to answer:

Which set of IP does CRISPR Therapeutics have, and what are the implications of the ongoing [patent fight](https://www.statnews.com/2016/07/07/crispr-patent-fight-evotec/)? 

How risky is [their pipeline](http://crisprtx.com/our-programs/our-pipeline.php), and what is the size of the market for the indicated diseases? How does this compare with their expected valuation of 4.7 million shares priced at $16/share?

As somebody in the field, gene editing corrections on cells are possible, but the efficiency is currently very low and so it is difficult to conceive of a therapy that edits other organs *in situ*. So far as I know, we are a long ways away from any sort of delivery vehicle that could get the sgRNA/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex into the target cells along with the repair template in any sort of efficient manner. For blood cells it is more realistic, since we can harvest blood and bone marrow, edit them *ex vivo*, screen for proper repair, and then return the edited cells as a form of autograft.

It is possible to imagine that they could correct (for example) the cystic fibrosis gene in induced pluripotent stem cells, differentiate these cells into lung or lung precursor cells, and then somehow get the patients to inhale a spray of these corrected cells that will lead to partially restored lung function. Still, I would put this at a low probability for a 10-15 year horizon.

What are your thoughts? Is this an IPO like Google, or an IPO like Facebook, or somewhere in between? If you have any questions about the science please ask, but I'll only be moderately useful with business oriented questions.",123

# Description
Hawaiian Holdings owns Hawaiian Airlines and operates scheduled air transportation of passengers and cargo. The Company offers transportation amongst the Hawaiian Islands (the Neighbor Island routes); between the Hawaiian Islands and certain cities in the United States (the North American routes), and between the Hawaiian Islands and the South Pacific, Australia, New Zealand and Asia (the International routes), collectively referred to as the Company's Scheduled Operations. 

## Recent financials 

You'd have to be living the hermit's life to not know that oil's decline's airline's delight! So it's no shock that earnings have tripled in the last few years.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $2.3bn | $2.3bn | $2.2bn | $2.0bn | $1.7bn|
|EPS | $2.98 | $1.10 | $0.98 | $1.01 | -$0.05|

But how do you judge this? Well, there are 
* passenger numbers
* passenger miles (i.e. no. of passengers times distance flown)
* revenues per mile
* cost per mile excluding oil
* oil cost per mile

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue per mile | 13.1 cents | 13.6 | 12.8 | 13.4 | 13.7|
|Cost ex. oil | 8.3 | 8.2 | 7.9 | 8.2 | 9.3|
|oil | 2.4 | 4.0 | 4.2 | 4.3 | 4.3|
|Margin | 2.4 | 1.4 | 0.8 | 0.9 | 0.2|

So the 40% decline in oil (air fuel) costs didn't all flow thro' to the bottom line with revenue off a little and other costs up a bit.  

Maybe the other factor is the strong dollar? Hitting international business?

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Domestic | $1.8bn | $1.7bn | $1.5bn | $1.4bn | $1.3bn|
|Pacific | $0.5bn | $0.6bn | $0.7bn | $0.6bn | $0.4bn|

## Competition

In their annual report they refer to the competition for passengers on ""North America"" routes: Alaska Airlines, American, United, Delta and Virgin. Then they refer to the local competitors for intra Hawaii traffic and international competition on flights to the other side of the Pacific.

Compared to the other Airlines on the stock market their margins and returns are respectable. They aren't best of class, but are clearly very good. 

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. | $2,352M | 25% | 53%
Alaska Air Group, Inc. | $5,733M | 31% | 38%
American Airlines Group Inc | $40,134M | 23% | 167%
United Continental Holdings Inc | $36,933M | 20% | 57%
Delta Air Lines, Inc. | $40,307M | 25% | 45%
Virgin America Inc | $1,592M | 14% | 44%
Southwest Airlines Co | $20,505M | 27% | 33%

## Cash / Debt?

Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. has $36M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 1% of the market value of Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. So nothing to watch out for here. 

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $46 target for Hawaiian Holdings. A little above their target, and their recommendation to clients is _Hold_.

# Valuation

Given the ""Hold"" you could be surprise that the valuation isn't high. And it's inline with the old hot stocks of ALK and LUV. The majors are even cheaper.

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/ha.o/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
HA.O | $2,644M | 10x | 13% | 0% | 12%
ALK | $8,384M | 10x | 2% | 2% | 16%
AAL.O | $19,994M | 7x | -16% | 1% | 36%
UAL | $17,030M | 7x | -ve | 0% | 28%
DAL | $29,170M | 7x | 11% | 2% | 23%
VA.O | $2,729M | 18x | 0% | 0% | 15%
LUV | $23,860M | 10x | 14% | 1% | 15%

# Dividends

Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. is not forecast to pay a dividend this year.

&gt; No dividends were paid by the Company during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 or 2013. Provisions in certain of the Company's aircraft lease agreements restrict the Company's ability to pay dividends.

Which is disappointing, though they do have the right to buyback some stock.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 14% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 7%. That's against a backdrop of sales up 3% in the 6 months to June.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers

&gt; Demand for travel to Hawaii is solid. Our network is balanced and we are growing our capacity and markets where we enjoy strong customer preference. We are well positioned with products and services tailored specifically for our guests, exceptional service and outstanding hospitality, all of this positions us extremely well for the periods ahead.

So, do you heed Wall Street's warning? And sit on the sidelines? Or is 10x earnings too good to miss. If it is, why not go for a major on 7x?

To some extent, I usually fear valuations this low. They look abnormal, as if I am staring at ""peak earnings"". But that wouldn't be fair. HA's been at 10x a share ""forever"".

Though given it's been a 10 bagger in 10 years, HA has actually outperformed ALK (a 6 bagger in 10 years). So it just feels like I'm too late to this party.

The rules are pretty simple, we can trade in UK stock market open times, and have £100,000 to invest in two portfolios across the FTSE 100 and Smallcap50. I don't know that much about stocks but I have family in banking so I have a rough idea. 

We can invest in companies and ETFs, nothing more (in this round at least). I am told ETFs are essentially a way to buy a commodity without actually buying it? If so, I didn't think many of these would be worth the risk with oil at a low and China potentially on the brink of a bubble burst.

But my main question is, where can someone like me get started, what should I look for? I don't need anyone to tell me exactly what to do, but I would really, really appreciate any and all advice.

Many thanks in advance

16-10-10,56urst,Best legal structure for long-term investing?,"Hi /r/investing! Long time lurker, first time poster here. 

Earlier this year, after talking with a friend, we decided to begin investing. Each month we each put in $500 and decide on a stock to buy. We're basically pursuing a low-risk, dividend approach. (With one exception, a considerable investment in USO.) We're buying unsexy things like GM, TOT, PG, etc. Eventually we may think about diversifying with bonds, but we're not there yet. The long-term goal is to create a portfolio of assets that will spin money forever, down to my (theoretical) children's children's children. Or whatever.

My question: what kind of legal structure should we set up? Right now we're two people with an e-Trade account. It's working fine, but I imagine that there could be another, better way. E.g.: an LLC? A registered partnership? A trust that controls a company that holds the shares? Two trusts (one for each of us, of course), that each control 50% of an LLC?

A few notes:
I'm not worried about fraud/my partner stealing my money/behaving inappropriately, so don't worry about that. I'm anxious to avoid double-taxation. I'm really worried that filing taxes with my current setup is going to become a big hassle. I will, hopefully, never sell these shares, so transferring them will eventually be a priority.

Tl;dr: should I make up a company because I think I'm going to have more and more shares over time?

Edit: I seriously considered whether or not this should be a daily advice thread post. I posted it as a new thread because I think it's relevant to many members of the subreddit, and I haven't seen the question asked before.",9

I have just saved a fair amount for an emergency fund and I feel more comfortable starting to have my %20 savings portion of my paycheck go into a portfolio.  I have done a fair amount of research and really all I am looking for is modest growth, more stability than anything and the higher the Div ratio the better.  

I looked into the SPY etf which has very positive reviews.  So when I went on Robinhood to look up SPY I noticed there are multiple ones.  What is the difference between these?  I noticed SPYD is a higher Div ratio so this one I am particularly interested in.  Is there anything by looking at it that would turn you away?  Can I expect the same level of volatility and growth from SPYD as i can from SPY?  

Also, If anyone wants to go through and give a brief description of the different ones (SPYG, SPYV, SPYD, etc.) that would be a tremendous help as I have no idea what these terms really mean!

Anytime there's a mass shooting sales tend to go up, when gun control bills are proposed sales go up, when Hillary wins sales will almost certainly go up for fear of a new AWB or similar. 

Whether or not that's rational is up for debate but I'm wondering what other industries have similar panicked buying of products or panic buying/selling of stocks? Or are otherwise directly influenced by current socio-political events and the emotions of customers?",2

Add ILMN(Illumina) to watchlist tomorrow am and buy soon.","Illumina has been hit with an overreaction from Wall Street after the bell today that could easily make us all some easy money in the coming months and potentially in the coming year(s), depending on your trading/investing timelines.  

They released that their q3 guidance would be 30 million short, making it 600 million rather than 630 million.  I understand there are arguments that people were expecting higher and that's why it dropped so low, but no.  Not 25% low.  10% I could see and makes more sense.  If you look at a 1 year chart for Illumina(technically speaking) they are pretty close to support, as they have done this before and it's out there for your own DD and reflects in the chart.  They release that they are gonna come up short ahead of earnings, stock plummets to support and wa-la, every time it flies right back.  Now it's not going to fly right back up immediately, it might hang out around 140's for a month, but this is considered the 13th most fastest growing company and being in the human genome business where they have 90% market share, they are a safe bet with a beautiful future.

I own 50 shares of ILMN.  I will be buying more ASAP and will hold til the next ride up again.  I am not pumping a multi-billion dollar company as I really don't believe any of you are real money movers, I just firmly believe, in my opinion, this is potentially a great opportunity to make some low risk returns, fundamentally and technically.  

I've received great advice from some of you and I'm sharing some of my own in return.

Suppose I invest in an index fund - say the VTI fund, which tracks US Stocks (but it can be any index). According to most experts, these types of stocks are a random walk, but upward trending.

That means, sooner or later, the stock price will go up...eventually.

What if I automated the following process:

1) Buy the index.

2) Sell when the index has gone up 1%

3) Buy when the index has gone down 1%

4) Repeat steps 2 and 3 forever.


In this method, I know there will be times when you won't have money in the stock market, but you will always buy low and sell high.

They want him to lead a new office and they're paying him 600k base should he accept. I'd be reporting directly to him if we both accept. The interesting thing is he comes from the game industry too. He has big trading experience either.  I'm wondering if this is a new take or direction on the markets or if we'd be focus on game industry related stocks.  

About the firm is they only trade their own money which is really cool. We would both be allowed to invest our own money into the fund. I've done my research and they are a valid prop firm.

16-10-12,571zoo,Question career path Post Bachelor Job - Investment Analyst,"Hello everyone,


I need some help and have some questions for some of you who are experienced working in a Mutual fund, or Hedge fund. I want to work in San Francisco, I live about 2 hours away.


Just some general background info on me:

I am a double major, I majored in accounting first, than got a second Degree in Finance. My GPA really lagged due to working 40 hours a week. I have 1 semester left after the current semester in school, but I no longer work and havent worked since 1/10/15.

2.65 Current GPA, and I have 10 Classes left, I think I will graduate with a 2.8.

I have been into the Stock Market since I was 19, I am now 23, so I have 4 years of trading/research knowledge. I have succesfully made money on forex trading(Bitcoins, GBPUSD, USDJPY) As well as SCTY, TWTR, and FB and few others. went from about 10K to about 45K.

I am very smart when it comes to the market. I read ALOT, because I understand reading is knowledge. Also I have day trading expierence Using Level 2 access.

I also am pretty good with excel when it comes to the formulas for yields, bonds, bills, vlookup ect. I also am very good in Accounting as I got my first degree in it. I can read and comprehend Fincial Statements. I know All journal entries including advanced accounting entries like vested stock, consolidation, loss tax Carry forwards etc.

Anyways, So my GPA lagged because I worked at Wells Fargo as a teller and banker for a little less than 3 Years, worked 40 hrs a week. My first year after transfering to my university, I got 3 ds, and 6 Cs. And yeah I know I regret it.

My last 5 classes I got an A B B B C, and This semester I expect A A B B B Dont know if this matters, but I am really trying, I am way smarter than my GPA states, at age 21 I didnt manage my time well, I put all my effort in Wells Fargo rsther than school and that was a mistake. I had great sales expierence from WF.

I want to get a job as a research analyst with a Fund. I will be taking the level 1 CFA Exam next year.  Will this put me on a career path of running my own fund in the future? Also was thinking of doing my MBA when I turn 30, so Ill have about 6 years of Work Exp.

A few questions:

Does working at Wells Fargo help me get a job at a Fund? The reason I ask is because I have not worked for over a year.

Will passing the lvl 1 CFA help me get into a fund?

I know they will look at me as a student, I dont want to get denied because of my GPA.

if you could answer just these few questions I would Really appreciate it!",1

16-10-12,5720mf,An interesting situation in gold miner ETFs...,"But first, a little basic background info...

There are 2 popular ETFs in the gold mining space: GDX and GDXJ.  GDX is primarily composed of senior mining companies, many of which include multiple producing mines.  GDXJ is directed toward junior mining companies.  Juniors encompass a variety of companies including miners with a few producing mines, miners with only one mine, and companies that do not yet have even a single producing mine.

When the price of gold is high, it is relatively easy for small companies to fund exploration and development.  When the price of gold is low, it becomes difficult.  In prolonged slumps, these early-stage juniors tend to stagnate without being able to push their projects into development.  You can see how junior miners perform relative to senior miners from the GDXJ/GDX ratio.

---------------------------------------

So, what is the interesting situation? Now and then, I like to look through the holdings of each ETF.  GDX doesn't look much different than it did in the past.  However, when looking through the holdings of GDXJ, I found something strange.  The 3rd largest holding of GDXJ is GDX.

I think what has happened is that the prolonged slump in gold has slowed down the development of junior gold miners that were already in existence.  Additionally, it discouraged people from starting new junior mining companies.  Now that the price of gold has recovered somewhat this year, more investors are investing money into gold.  However, since the number of new companies has been limited, the managers of the ETF are having trouble finding companies to invest this new money into.  If the bull market in gold continues, we will probably see this position sold off and new mining companies added to the ETF.

What do you think? Feel free to share your opinions.",10
16-10-12,5745pf,The Deplorable Device - How to harness Quantum Suicide to become Insanely Rich,"This was something that I have been pondering for years but thought that was literally too dangerous an idea to talk about to other people, ie Roko's Basilisk, however today a post that touches on the idea hit the top of r/philosophy so I think the cat is out of the bag.

Essentially what ""The Deplorable Device"" is a kind of perfect Artificial Intelligence replacement that uses Quantum Suicide.

First let's briefly go over the standard Quantum Suicide apparatus: A Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) that generates 1's and 0's in a perfectly random binary sequence that is hooked up to a computer, and a shotgun that has an electronic device that pulls its trigger also hooked up to a computer.

The standard Quantum Suicide thought experiment is arranged such that for every 1 that the QRNG produces, the trigger on the shotgun is pulled, and for every 0 the QRNG produces, the trigger is not pulled. In theory, if the Copenhagen Interpretation is wrong, and the Many Worlds interpretation is right, putting the shotgun to your head and starting this apparatus will be entirely ""safe"".

Say you run the apparatus for 10 cycles, if the Many Worlds Interpretation is correct, there should be (at least) one distinct parallel universe that splits off for each possible combination of 1s and 0s in a length-10 sequence (there would be 512 of them), but there would only be one of those parallel universes in which the sequence is ""0000000000"", the only sequence to never trigger the shotgun and consequentially kill you.

You would always find yourself in the universe where the QRNG generated all 0s, because you would obviously have no awareness in the ones where even a single 1 was generated, you would be dead.

That's the standard Quantum Suicide thought experiment.

Now for a slight variation or what I call The Deplorable Device.

It still uses the QRNG and a shotgun connected to a computer, but rather than having the 1s and 0s directly connected to the shotgun firing or not firing, an intermediary actionable is inserted between the two, and the shotgun is set to trigger based on a certain pre-programmed criteria of the outcome of the actionable.

More simply put: [something happens] if the QRNG outputs a 1, and [something else happens] if the QRNG outputs a 0, and the shotgun only doesn't trigger if those somethings happened in a certain way.

It's much easier to explain using a concrete example so let's use the first example that I think most smart people would probably use a perfect AI for if it fell into their laps: beating the stock market.

So in the case of using The Deplorable Device for beating the Market, you would take a very volatile stock (one that has large and rapid fluctuations in price), and program your computer to buy/hold the stock if the QRNG outputs a 1, and to sell/not buy the stock if the QRNG outputs a 0.

You then program the computer to trigger the shotgun if after any sell (0), you lose money.

So if you put $1000 in your trading account, put the shotgun to your head and ran the machine for 10 cycles, and the QRNG generates a sequence like 0001110010, the device would:

not buy the stock for 3 cycles (000) after each zero the computer checks to see if money has been lost (which of course it hasn't since you haven't bought in) finds that it hasn't and so doesn't trigger the shotgun

would buy all $1000 worth of the stock on the 4th cycle and hold the stock for 2 more cycles (111)

would sell ALL the stocks you purchased, and check to see if money was lost, triggering the shotgun if it was, otherwise not buy again for 1 more cycle (00)

would buy stocks on the 9th cycle (1) using ALL of the money that was made on any previous trades

would sell ALL the stocks you purchased, checking to see if you lost money, triggering the shotgun if you had.

Running THIS machine for 10 cycles still splits into (at least) 512 parallel universes, one for each possible combination of 1s and 0s in a length-ten sequence, only the criteria for which combinations will NOT trigger the shotgun have changed.

In this case, only the sequences that correspond to buy/sell sequences that DO NOT lose money DO NOT trigger the shotgun.

This was an extremely simple version of the idea, you could tweak it by making the QRNG generating sequences of numbers 0-3 and using 2 and 3 for shorting and covering stocks for faster gains. You could have the machine programmed to choose the most volatile of all the stocks on a particular day to trade with for even FASTER gains.

In all probability you could turn $1000 into hundreds of millions in a single day with the right program.

But this really is only the tip of the iceberg for what The Deplorable Device can do, it can generate a string of characters that can match ANY criteria, providing that there is a foolproof method of checking that it does in fact match said criteria, and it is not totally impossible for the criteria to be met.

For example, you could have the machine generate the password or private key to ANY digital security system on the planet IN A SINGLE TRY. You would merely program the machine to only NOT trigger the shotgun if the password/private key was accepted on the first try.

You could have the device generate all on its own a perfect copy of Duke Nuke'em 3D. You would just need a cipher system of encoding the QRNG's random string of digits into code, and then a manner in checking to ensure that the code that was produced exactly matched the code that makes up Duke Nuke'em 3D.

You could have the device generate the genetic sequence of a new supervirus to which there was no known remedy. In this case perhaps you would hire a virologist to check the product against these criteria and to press a button if it doesn't match, unbeknowst to him the button triggers the shotgun.

You could have the device generate a speech that convince a person of anything, so long as there was a method of knowing when the person was not convinced so the shotgun can be triggered.

You could have the machine generate Best selling novels, Oscar-winning screenplays, War-winning strategies, foolproof business plans, or the entire codebase of Google.

So long as something is not impossible (there exists NO possible series that will match a certain criteria), and there is a way of measuring whether or not a particular set of criteria has been met, there is nothing that the Deplorable Device cannot do.

It's something that I have thought for a long time about and I would be lying if I said I wasn't tempted to try and build it.

I have also have spent some time thinking about whether or not it's a possible solution to the Fermi paradox. Since the only way to ""bring someone with you"" into a particular parallel universe is to make sure that they die as well with the specified criteria, ie you need to use a bomb rather than a shotgun, and if you want to take the whole world with you, well, you get the idea...

I called it the Deplorable Device after ""The Deplorable Word"" in C.S. Lewis' The Magician's nephew, its the magic word that a Demoness uses to kill every living thing on a planet except for her.

I'm curious to know what other people think of this.",45

16-10-12,572ftu,Need some help with Franklin Templeton withdrawal fee?,"I have a friend I'm trying to help out by getting her investments into a passive, stable portfolio. She currently has her IRAs in some franklin templeton mutual funds with ~2% (!) expense ratios. She is a set and forget type person with no interest in actively managing her portfolio so we are going the Vanguard (VG) index route.

So she called Vangaurd to get some help transferring her IRAs. They said they don't know how Franklin Templeton (FT) works. So she called FT and the rep told her that she doesn't have any fees except 15$ a year. Which may be true is some technical sense, but we're talking about expense ratios any way. So she smells bullshit and says she wants to transfer anyway, and now he's saying there is a 1% fee to withdrawal her money. Or at least the money that has been invested for less then 12 months.

I've never heard of such a thing. Is there a way around this? Is it worth waiting a year to avoid the withdraw fee? At 2% expense  per year it sounds like pulling out now is a better option.

Also she is a reddit lurker so I am sending her a link to this page. Somebody is full of shit, please tell me it isn't me.",0

http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38315.Fooled_by_Randomness

It is for anyone who is legitimately serious about trading. Trust me. Ignorance is bliss, but not in trading and the markets.

As someone who has been developing algorithmic systems and been a technical trader for years, it really opens your eyes to the reality of the world, and describes how incredibly ignorant we humans can be when it comes to uncertainty. It has led me to move towards strategies which reduce uncertainty as much as possible, and strategies which do not rely on directional 'predictions'

We tend to overestimate what we think we know, while at the same time we underestimate what we don't know. To acknowledge uncertainty is to voluntarily plead ignorance, something no one wants to do, as they fear it will make them appear 'stupid'. 

“Certainty is something that is likely to take place across the highest number of different alternative histories. Uncertainty concerns events that should take place in the lowest number of them.”

16-10-12,572os2,Investment Risks with Pinks,"Hello everyone! This is my first post here in Reddit. Recently, I had started to invest in the market on my own accord to help grow what little money I have. This in the hopes one day I can retire early (I can hope right?!). 

Currently I am invested in a few stocks in different sectors. Some of my portfolio: I got into AMD when it was down around 3.5 a share, INNV @ 9 cents a share, RXMD @ 2.5 cents a share, GOVX 6.7 cents a share, and some other less volatile stocks. I try to consider my pension as my safety net since I know some of the pink sheet stocks I am invested in are... a bit of a gamble. 

Anyways on to my questions:

I want to start learning how to read charts with a higher level of confidence and some of the important nuances that you have found as a good indicator (for anything). I have access youtube videos, investopedia, google searchers, ect to help me understand how to read candle charts, 50 MA 200 MA, RSI, ect. There seems to be a ton I still do not have knowledge on and the ones I cited I am learning to use now. 

I am also interested in hearing everyone's trading strategies or how they go about evaluating stocks? I always hear the term technical traders without understanding their strategies/lens they invest with. 

Another thing I do not feel comfortable enough with is other markets and call/puts (primarily because TDAmeritrades interface SUCKS) If you have any tips, suggestions, or feedback I would greatly appreciate it. I hope to learn from everyone's experience on this board!

Bloomberg - Nobel Prize Winner Wants You to Stop Treating Bonds Like Stocks http://bloom.bg/2ebEWqF


E: I feel like a lot of people are misinterpreting or just not reading the article.  The author is highlighting the potentially misguided efforts to make debt markets as transparent as equity markets. 

&gt;Holmstrom's paper serves as a reminder of the perilous consequences of actually treating them the same. Specifically, he cautions against imposing the transparency requirements on debt markets that are more commonly expected of equities. 

&gt;""I will argue that 'no questions asked' is the hallmark of money market liquidity; that this is the way money markets are supposed to look when they are functioning well,"" he writes. Attempts to reform credit markets based on insights gleaned from equity markets ""can be very misleading"" the economist says — and worse, they can stoke the crises that they're trying to prevent.

And from the abstract of the paper:

&gt;Money markets are fundamentally different from stock markets. Stock markets are 
about price discovery for the purpose of allocating risk efficiently. Money markets 
are about obviating the need for price discovery using over-collateralised debt to 
reduce the cost of lending. Yet, attempts to reform credit markets in the wake of the 
recent financial crisis often draw on insights grounded in our understanding of 
stock markets. This can be very misleading. The paper presents a perspective on the 
logic of credit markets and the structure of debt contracts that highlights the 
information insensitivity of debt.

Gold is going back below $1,200/oz and here's why. 

1. [Recent drop in gold breaks trend](http://imgur.com/CFFxXNo) and a lack of stimulation despite major news events leads me to believe that gold is consolidating before further pullback. After previously touching the $1,240 range last week I expect the next leg down to return to this level before the Fibonacci Prophecy kicks us below $1,200. 

2. The [dollar is surging and I think its only going to go higher](http://imgur.com/i4kE0PU). The greenback is looking like a better and better safe-haven asset in times of global socio-political uncertainty. Expectations of Fed decisions is only a piece of the pie. The dollar's climb is accelerating and I'm expecting we break the 100-mark within 2 weeks. 

3. [The Fibonacci Prophecy](http://imgur.com/0dVNv8g). The fibonacci time series has accurately highlighted times of previous volatility. (Look for the vertical blue lines). The next mark on the time series is on Tuesday, November 8, 2016. I expect this to mark a substantial change in sentiment and leg down below the $1,200 range for gold. 

4. [Other currencies like the GBP are in the shitter](http://imgur.com/KXonXyG) and headed to the landfill. Throw some more steam behind the greenback. 

Theres more but my head hurts from staring at the computer screen all day making those fucking charts.

I recently bought 1570 shares in Novavax and 250 shares in Micron, $2.24 and $17.66 respectively. 

Both stocks have taken a big kick in the pants over the last weeks  and I'm kind of at a loss what to do. Should I hold, should I cut my losses and walk away, etc.

Just when I thought both stocks were going to improve, I've been surprised to find they collapsed even more - for what I can see as no reason other than a) profit taking or b) externalities freaking out investors (rate hike, etc).

There seems to be a lot of chatter regarding the market deflating and I'm just wondering how much of a concern I should have. Sometimes the pessimism is exhausting. Case and point: the HSBC report talking about a red alert, saying the S&amp;P and DOW were going to drop, and same with the market - but they didn't  - they went up. 

I'm just trying to find some sanity in this whole thing. The markets seem so irrational and cynical. That being said, I don't believe things can just keep going up and up.

I'm also looking on some advice on the best way to position myself on a stock. Should I pick a few stocks, set a limit order at what I feel is a fair assessment and leave it at that? once a I own the stock: should I set a stop limit/market order and get out if it swings to low? I know I should ignore everyday swings, but I'm having a hard time figuring out when too much is enough and I should stand on the side lines and wait for the stock to recover. I guess that is a tough question, since paint thresholds are different for everyone. I'm just tired of waking up to find my stock shit the bed for no apparent reason.

I already made a bit similar thread like this one here, although there I had the code ready when making the thread:
https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/4u969n/finding_undervalued_dividend_stocks_with_python/

If you check out the stocks I found with my simple algorithm most of them have gone up or at least are not down much by now. 

Now that I have some freetime again I am thinking of creating something again in Python. 

My current idea:
nasdaq.com offers a so called Guru Analysis through the following link: http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/KO/guru-analysis
The above example is with Coca Cola

The script would parse the below link for a set of Stock Tickers:
http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/&lt;stockticker&gt;/guru-analysis

After the data has been collected it would just display the percentage numbers for each stock's Guru recommendations. 
The list would be ordered based on preference (which Guru you prefer) and there would be a last column which would be the sum of all Guru recommendations. 

What do you think on such a system? Is it worth starting something like this? Is there something similar already available? Does nasdaq.com allow webscraping (collecting data with a bot)?

16-10-13,578qvf,Trying to develop a methodology to compare real estate markets,"Hey investors,
I know real estate isn't often discussed in this thread, but hopefully it's welcome.  I have been working on a project where I'm trying to use public data to compare cities in the US for their attractiveness in terms of real estate investing.  I'd like to present my method and get some feedback!

I am trying to come up with a score for each city based on the following metrics:

* 1 Yr Job Growth
* 3 Yr Job Growth
* Current Unemployment Rate
* 1 Yr Unemployment Rate Growth
* 3 Yr Unemployment Rate Growth
* 1 Yr Median Income Growth
* 3 Yr Median Income Growth
* Current Gross Median Rent
* 1 Yr Gross Median Rent Growth
* 3 Yr Gross Median Rent Growth
* 1 Yr Population Growth
* 3 Yr Population Growth
* Current % Rent vacancy
* Current % renters
* Current Affordability (% people paying less than 35% income to rent)
* Current Median owner occupied home value
* 1 Yr growth median owner occupied home value
* 3 Yr growth median owner occupied home value
* Current Rent to Price (median gross rent / median owner occupied home value)

For each category, I look at what's best and what's average.  Average is awarded no points, and best is given 100% of the points for that category.  I then add up all the points and rank each city.  Some cities have a lot of points, some have negative.  Theoretically, an average city would have 0 points and the best would have the most. Some categories are worth more points than others.

Am I missing anything? Am I looking at too much economic data?  Which categories are more important than others?",1

Mostly because I don't think this rate of production will last longer than a year regardless of geopolitics or the fact US production will increase immediately after a deal is made.  

Nat. Gas on the other hand has had a tremendous climb since March. So... what affect would a deal have on the price of nat. gas.

I understand that the deal is mostly focused on oil, but an increase in the price of oil will allow companies to spend more money on the production of oil and gas.  Also, while ngas demand is increasing, production has remained relatively the same even though gas prices have fluctuated and production is  expected to heavily increase next year.  

Anyways, if you wanted some autistic DD at 3am on why to short nat. gas here it is... Also, tell me how autistic this is

This has made me significant gains since May; nevermind I lost them all in a YOLO. BCOV has been good to me though, which is why I'm  sharing.

It has gone up and down pretty steadily in the past; two bear days, then some bull days, then one or two bear days, then some more bull, pretty consistent.

Not sure about future gains though, due to technicals. I feel like it's going to fall through support; but it may just bounce off the ichimoku cloud, and it's hard to find news.

So Dropbox the company received 6.25% of all procees of the IPO, right? Why don't companies keep much more of the proceeds from an IPO? I mean, they can get like 3 billion for the company's cash balance and then 1 billion of stock of the employees who can decide to sell or hold. Why is it always such a small percentage (same for Facebook for example)? Can a company even 'hold' its own equity, because I think it can't? So how exactly does it get proceeds from an IPO?

Ever since Uber and Tesla appeared there's been a ""driverless / eco-friendly"" theme to transport. Mobileye is one of the few pure plays. So what's driving it?

# Description
Mobileye N.V. is engaged in the development of computer vision and machine learning, data analysis, localization and mapping for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies. So it's one of the key tools for driverless cars!

In numbers:

* 25 global automakers
* available in 221 car models from 19 OEMs
* installed in approximately 9.7 million vehicles worldwide 

The business model is to supply Tier 1 auto parts companies who then combine Mobileye with their offerings and deliver to the end manufacturers. OEM clients include: Autoliv, Delphi, Gentex, TRW, Valeo. End users inc. Fiat Chrysler, BMW, GM, Ford, Honda, Tesla, Volkswagen, etc. Surprisingly Toyota isn't on the list.

## Recent financials 


It's clear that the technology is in rocket ship mode. And that's now converting to profits.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $241m | $144m | $81m | $40m | $19m|
|EPS | $0.29 | -$0.28 | -$6.03 | $0.00 | -$0.33|
|No. of shares | 238m | 108m | 37m | 40m | 40m|

But is the business going to hit hyper speed? Well, Wall St's projecting sales of $347m this year (up $100m, after adding $100m is sales last year) and projection of $497m in 2017, i.e up substantially more the following year.

## Competition

There's own description of the competitive situation isn't that useful in their annual report. So recommend this commentary at [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Who-is-competing-directly-against-Mobileye-in-the-market-for-Advanced-Driver-Assistance-Systems-ADAS)

Seems there are multiple auto-parts and technology companies playing in the space, but Mobileye has the lead. Though Panasonic and Nvidia aren't far behind.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Mobileye NV | $301M | 35% | 18%
ADAS competitors |   |   |  
NVIDIA Corporation | $5,439M | 24% | 21%
Panasonic Corporation (ADR) | $71,457M | 9% | 9%
Mobileye NV | $301M | 35% | 18%
other players |   |   |  
Autoliv Inc. | $9,713M | 12% | 16%
Delphi Automotive PLC | $15,767M | 17% | 46%
Gentex Corporation | $1,625M | 35% | 19%
Harman International Industries Inc | $6,912M | 12% | 15%
Texas Instruments Incorporated | $12,899M | 43% | 30%

## Cash / Debt?

Mobileye NV has $290M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 3% of the market value of Mobileye NV. Given the business is cashflow positive, I can only assume this is going to grow!

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $58.67 for Mobileye NV and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 53% to their target. In fact it the last 3 months even though the stock may be off 20%, Wall Street's upgraded their price target from $55 to $59.

# Valuation

So the rosy picture only hits the rocks when we see the price. At 54x earnings 2016, I get sticker shock. Look out a year to 2017 when earnings are forecast to be $1.07 (up 50%) and its 36x. Still a shock, but more in line with NVDA.

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/mbly.k/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
MBLY.K | $8,383M | 54x | 48% | 0% | 1%
ADAS competitors |   |   |   |   |  
NVDA.O | $35,540M | 36x | 21% | 1% | 3%
PCRFY.PK | $24,625M |16x | 12% | 2% | 22%
other players |   |   |   |   |  
ALV | $9,041M | 15x | 8% | 2% | 12%
DLPH.K | $18,458M | 11x | 13% | 2% | 11%
GNTX.O | $5,082M | 15x | 11% | 2% | 10%
HAR | $5,687M | 12x | 15% | 2% | 12%
TXN.O | $68,680M | 22x | 13% | 2% | 8%

But frankly, the earnings figure is sort of irrelevant. This is a top line story. As long as they can show substantial growth at the topline and better still an acceleration in revenues, then, the current valuation looks fair. 

On the other hand, if the engine splutters, the stock will hit the skids. (please excuse the puns).

# Dividends

And of course, they aren't forecast to pay a dividend this year. This is a growth stock!

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -20% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 3%. That's against a backdrop of sales up 60% in the 6 months to June and earnings up 90%.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, they discussed new partnerships, the need for industry standardization, and their relationship with Tesla which has got a lot of press. Nothing in the call indicated any danger to their near term forecasts. 

Though they've not given an indication for 2017. As we approach the end of the year, and we start shifting our thinking forward, I suspect that will impact the forecasts and stock.

For now, I'm undecided on their top line, so given the high valuation, I'm not joining the ride.

I walked into a faggot themed room...fag wallpaper, stuffed fags, little fagurines, faggots everywhere. On the bed there were three extremely beautiful naked men sprawled out...each with a different fag tattooed on their left breast. The one with a fag was getting railed by some asian dude, and the other two just kept begging, ""please Shkreli, it's my turn...I need you."" So I start walking up to the one with the black fag, and I say ""well, maybe I can help out"", and all three of the guys give me the big X with crossed arms. ""What's so great about this guys dick?"" At that point the dude starts pulling out and turning towards me. He knocks over a table of hundreds of little faggot figurines that shatter all over the floor with his massive pecker. Once I see his face I realize I've seen him before...it's JNUG. ""Oh, hi faggot."" He smiles, and points to his cock....and there it was clear as day, his bulging purple veins spelled out X I V. He walks up and gets in the next guy, who immediately starts to orgasm, and screams BUY THE FUCKING DIIIIPPPPP!!!! Then he looked me in the eyes and whispered ""you're next fag"".

16-10-12,576t10,"$MACK, troubling but buying opportunity. The Numbers","Wanted to quickly recap the last 9 days since I posted about $MACK. 

Since then we have seen a pretty wild ride of ups and downs, stock reacting to different information both positively and negatively to even the positive NAPOLI study, which finalized what Merrimack and a majority of us already believed regarding the stock. Yet, we saw the stock peak at $6.09 during trading hours, and close at $5.44. Weird, but here are some numbers to look at. 

_________________________________
**Short Interest**

Since June 15th of this year, there has been an increase in the SI of 16million. Sitting at ~36million as of writing this, 30% of the float has been shorted. This could be done by some very wealthy individuals who are aiming to keep the price down for accumulation, just speculation, but why would JP Morgan downgrade after financing issues met (like the $RLYP downgrade by Morgan Stanley right before buyout). They listed financing as a big issue.

_________________________________
**Sales Figures**

1H of 2016 was actually underwhelming for Merrimack, however it wasn't exactly negative. Q1 = $11mil and Q2 = $12.9mil. For anyone who was also involved in $RLYP, this would have been a very attractive number. Although unconfirmed, July and August have boasted a $4.8mil and $6.1mil respectively. Sitting at an estimated $34.8mil for 8 months of the year.

_________________________________
**Spending**

As we all have followed, along with the CEO resigning there has been 200mil cut from spending over the next 24 months. This is substantial, as this puts spending in 2017 around 100million, a huge reduction. This will allow the company to survive through all of 2017. So any dilution or offering fears/suggestions can frankly be ignored. 

_________________________________
**EU Approval and Market**

I am still searching for the deal regarding Shire and Merrimack in the EU. All I can find is that the deal is to be valued at $600million worth of milestone payments plus a royalty agreement, which I am unable to find. Furthermore, a quick search stated that in 2012 there were ~53,000 pancreas patients in the EU, about the same as the US. As the US market is predicted at 20,000 patients, we can assume Europe is close. 

However, for this case, as we don't know royalties, easier to ignore the EU financially so as not to over estimate. We can assume that sales figure will also be similar for Shire when they do finally have the go ahead from the EMA.

_________________________________
**Profitability**

The most interesting part of this whole story is sales. As of right now we know that the company, in 2017, will have to pay $100million out for company expenses. This equates to about $8.3million a month. I am not totally sure how accurate this is, but it seems to be close, disallowing for anything drastic. 

The jump from July to August is estimated to be about 26% going on the most recent numbers from The Street. Great, but I don't believe anyone should rely on that to be a consistent level of growth. I would like to think 10% month over month is attainable for the rest of this year. Assuming that can happen, the revenue from Onivyde becomes very interesting. By the end of December, Onivyde would be selling $9million a month. This, going hand in hand with reducing costs, actually could make the company profitable, as a full year of at least that level of sales = $108million, assuming no growth. 

What I also find interesting about the 9million a month figure, is the actual number of patients needed to raise that number. 

Onivyde is dosed at 1 vial every 2 weeks (2 a month). 
The lowest cost for Onivyde I could find is $1666. 

So for one month, we would need 2701 patients each month to use the drug twice. 

&gt; 2701patients x 2timesMonthly x 1666cost = ~$9million

Also considering the survival rate is 6.1 months, we can assume many of these patients will survive for a longer period (thanks to Onivyde), and continue to use the drug. So the likelihood of this maintaining throughout the year seems pretty manageable to do. With the current sales figures, we are looking at about 1830 patients, so not a huge difference. 

I am not at all doubting my DD at these current prices, and I am looking to accumulate myself as this price continue to waiver.

**Shire**

As of right now, Shire is getting almost nothing from the Merrimack deal. With the continued successful sales, and NAPOLI study, PLUS the upcoming MM-302 and MM-121 data, they could be pressured to make a decision as to if they want the whole market, and frankly it could be cheap. Assuming a minimum 800million for US and EU each, $1.6b isn't a bad valuation ($13.3 per share). As MACK becomes a more profitable organization, the price can only go up. 

If I have missed anything, or you need to add info, I would be grateful for anything. 

Good luck!

EDIT: I am obviously long. 10k shares, $5.47 cost basis.

# Description
salesforce.com, inc. is a provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions, with a focus on customer relationship management (CRM). The Company's Customer Success Platform, including sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, community management, analytics, application development, etc. 

So why buy Twitter? Here's that [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-m-a-salesforce-com-idUSKCN12A2B2) says:

&gt; Unlike Twitter, its main product is aimed at business users, not consumers. Under Salesforce.com, Twitter could become a corporate tool used to power sentiment analysis and nurture customer relationships.

Now odd that that might seem, remember that we the user of Google are not the ""customers"". The advertisers are the customers. So perhaps there is method in the madness?

## Recent financials 

It's really hard to not be impressed by a top line like CRM's! And given it's a ""cloud"" business with a ""SaaS"" model, the momentum should run. Why? folks are signing up for monthly subscriptions and they just seem to never go cancelling them in the software space.

|Jan year-end |2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $6.7bn | $5.4bn | $4.1bn | $3.1bn | $2.3bn|
|EPS | -$0.07 | -$0.42 | -$0.39 | -$0.48 | -$0.02|

Of course, it's troubling that the company hasn't turned a profit in the last 5 years, but here's to a first in the year to Jan 2017!

## Competition

Talking about the competition, Salesforce highlights:

&gt; We compete primarily with generalized platforms and vendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise apps, including CRM, collaboration and business intelligence software. We also compete with internally developed apps. We may encounter competition from established enterprise software vendors, as well as start-up and midsized companies focused on disruption, who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services. 

Though one of the competitive risks they highlight is actual a strength of there own!

&gt; Many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to an enterprise cloud computing application service.

i.e. like a lot of software based services, once you've got the client they are loathed to leave.

And how does this show on in the financials, well the old men of Enterprise technology (MSFT, ORCL, SAP) enjoy little growth but great returns and margins. But the new kids, CRM, WDAY, NOW have the growth but little margin or return.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
salesforce.com, inc. | $7,475M | 8% | 4%
Microsoft Corporation | $85,320M | 33% | 22%
Oracle Corporation | $37,194M | 42% | 19%
SAP SE (ADR) | $23,533M | 32% | 16%
Intuit Inc. | $4,694M | 32% | 46%
Workday Inc | $1,352M | -15% | -31%
ServiceNow Inc | $1,194M | -8% | -117%

## Cash / Debt?

If we look at salesforce's balance sheet we can see it has $1,340M of net debt. That is 2.2x it's latest operating profit. So it's a $50bn market value business with quite a bit of debt on it's books and it's considering a bid for TWTR a $13bn value business (though $2bn of that is cash).

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $93.51 for salesforce.com, inc. and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 29% to their target.

# Valuation

I've always struggled to value the highflying SaaS businesses. The regular metrics just don't give any comfort. And if I switch to price-to-sales I still get faced with CRM on 6x forward sales versus MSFT/ORCL on 4x. So where's the comfort there?

And I can't even hang my hat on the earnings the year after next :( With a [forecast](http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/analyst?symbol=CRM.N) of $0.95 this year and just $1.27 the year after. 

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/crm/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
CRM | $49,608M | 76x | 30% | 0% | 1%
MSFT.O | $445,654M | 20x | 9% | 3% | 8%
ORCL.K | $156,056M | 14x | 8% | 2% | 9%
SAP | $110,016M | 21x | 11% | 1% | 6%
INTU.O | $27,597M | 25x | 17% | 1% | 5%
WDAY.K | $17,570M | -ve | 38% | 0% | -ve
NOW | $12,963M | 120x | 44% | 0% | -ve

To try and justify the valuation you need to dig into the cashflow statement and drink from the SaaS KoolAid. For example on the managements 2Q results they talked about:

&gt; our full year operating cash flow guidance to a year-over-year growth rate of 20% to 21% which allows us to remain on track for our first $2 billion cash flow year. 

Now 25x cashflow doesn't look ""hideous"" for a business growing like CRM... but if you start looking at the way that figure is calculated, I expect you'll be surprised to see Depreciation &gt; capex, half of the figure coming in deferred revenue, and a substantial % from stock-options-plan adjustments.

# Dividends
You won't be surprised that salesforce.com, inc. is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. 

Though in share contrast to the big caps who like doing share buybacks, the number of share in circulation at CRM is up substantially in each of the last 5 years. 

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -11% that compares with no change in the earnings forecasts. The backdrop has been continued double digit top line growth at 26% in the first 6 months.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, they raised guidance for sales, expressed confidence in their margin, spoke of an exciting new set of products (e.g. Einstein), strong cashflows and much more.

In the near-term it's hard to see any catalyst other than the rumor mill round Twitter. And binary outcomes are a horrible environment to take a position in. You'll either feel like a hero or get hammered. 

For me, it's one to sit out. Unless of course the stock get's hammered, with investors throwing the baby out with the bathwater!

16-10-12,5778ia,I wish to propose something that has never been done to my CEO,"Reddit I need some help. I know there are a lot smarter and more experienced people than me here, so I hope someone can help and put their 2 cents into this idea of mine.

Background first.

I work as an underwriter for a merchant cash company [MCA] and our business is buying future receivables solely of businesses. I suppose you call it promissory notes of unsubordinate debt or unsecured debt. The product legally is not a loan and we get around $1.25 on $1 within 6 months. We fund up to $250,000 to a single business owner and we are about to reach the $300,000,000 in funding with an average default rate around 10%

Facts: My company sells delinquent debt and we offer major incentives to a merchant that will pay us off early (reasons: liquidity, risk, etc)....

I want to propose to my CEO that we create the first platform that would sell a good standing Merchant Cash Advance within the month of funding to a third party. We would take a big cut in the profit from the MCA (promissory note), but we would improve our cashflows, turn around time, and eliminate our risk. The buyer will absorb the risk but have a chance to yield yearly 8%-12% with monthly distributions

I taunted with a few ideas on how to go about this, but I'm unaware of the legality of any of them. The idea of a fund compromised of this type of promissory notes is something that has never been done, I am quite certain..... as it stands, this promissory notes are not securities nor are regulated by the SEC.

Anyways this is a bit of a rant to clear my own head since I am a little bit depressed by the fact that I do not have much going for me career-wise at this time but I will continue to dream big and think big ... who knows maybe spearheading and developing an idea as innovative as this could change my life.",2

16-10-12,577asi,Does this trading strategy exist?,"I was thinking today about the concept of arbitrage, and thought about the following scenario:

A casual google search shows that Apple's equity value represents 3.34% of the S&amp;P500. Would there ever be a scenario where, even for an exceedingly brief moment, this ratio would be thrown out of whack? Say there's massive buying pressure and for some reason even for a split second, Apple comprises 3.35% of the index. Could one not short Apple at this moment with the theory that it would regress back to being 3.34%? Furthermore, if we think about this relationship inversely, could one track components as a means to get out in front of the index moving? This sounds to me like something an HFT firm would do, but say Apple has tremendous buying pressure as previously mentioned; this would push the S&amp;P 500 up. Is it theoretically possible that, in the time it takes the Apple's increased equity value to register in the price of the S&amp;P 500, that one could get in between and front run the index?

Obviously this is not a widespread/possible thing, or people would be pocketing free money day in and day out, but I was just wondering if there was a name for this kind of strategy and if there's anything similar.",2

http://www.newsoracle.com/2016/10/12/what-are-analysts-suggestions-on-novavax-inc-nasdaqnvax-2/

I'm no professional trader, but it seems pretty low risk, relatively speaking. It's in a deep, deep hole, and unless I'm mistaken, there are only 2 options:

1. A rebound where everyone wins

2. The company implodes/de-lists

Obviously the analyst projections are a ridiculously wide range, from 1 to 14, but what I'm really concerned about is this window of opportunity. The shareholder and analyst meeting has been postponed to Nov. 9th, directly post-election. Will that be where the window closes? A lot of very smart people are saying that the market is going to flip out around the election, will a biomed company like Novovax be severely impacted? Considering the candidates, I kinda doubt it.

As I said before, I'm no professional, I've spent the last year recovering from the instant 15% I lost when I started in November last year (I have recovered fully). That being said, am I missing something? I only cited 2 of the most recent articles I read concerning them, turn to the first 4 pages of Google for the rest of the research. It looks like a solid investment to me, and less of a gamble than a lot of other options.

16-10-13,57c7yn,"XBI, IBB, and LABU","Ay everybody.

I believe the recent downturn of IBB/XBI to be in part from Hillary's seeming win in November (read the anonymous post, though on this page). There was also ILMN destruction this week too. 

What's interesting about this is I believe that Hillary has been **well priced in since last year**. The issue is, biotech is still believed to be in a bubble. I'll go off on a small tangent here and explain why;

Bubbles occur in things where the intrinsic value is very, *very* subjective. I.e. money. Money, currency, *gold* and things that are essentially assets, or 'houses' of value all require an essential and sociological (yet arbitrary) agreement on their worth. 

Precious metals will always be in a bubble, and so, technically is fiat currency - we all simply hold their value by a very fundamental idea of worth and value. Have an apocalypse and gold and a dollar become worthless. However - *cures to diseases do not*.

Anyway, the above doesn't really matter in the market in times like these and probably never, but it's an important aspect of the term 'bubble'.

With that said, we have the election coming up very quickly.

XBI will likely die if Hillary is elected (although the bottom is in sight, as we have been getting hit *all fucking year*).

The questions then become

* What if Trump gets elected (will those emails actually hurt her chances?
* If Hillary gets elected, how far down do we go, and for how long?

For Trump, we should see XBI performing equal to or better than S&amp;P because Trump is pro-deregulation across the board but brings with uncertainty on a grander scale. If SPX decides that Trump is actually OK for the market, xbi is going to explode.

For the second item, Hillary has been bashing drug prices to get baby boomer votes and shit like that - *but big pharma lines her fucking pockets*.

It's all a fucking bluff and it's incredibly surprising that the market is actually buying into this bullshit. She may make some regulations for drug price ceilings - *but it will not be material*. It may look ""good"" for prices and consumers - *but she won't dare actually change anything*.

So how do we play this?

Well I'm already balls deep in my favorite anti-fungal company, so my moves are limited. 

But: If we see leaks on Hillary skewing towards Trump, we are going to go for LABU.

If we see leaks (and voting response to) be pretty much hot air, we need to go into LABD through the election. 

After ~a week~, and things seem to be priced in

CANN has a market cap of $61 Mil and is a small cap growth company. I've noticed ever since those articles came out about the legalization of Mary Jane being on the ballot in five states and the ""polls"" are telling us that it will pass in all 5 states, this stock price has sky rocketed along with volume. Now my question is...are people really that fucking stupid? Is the stock price jumping just because its essentially the only publicly traded MJ stock that isn't a worthless penny stock? Like people are investing in this thing without even looking at what type of company CANN is!!! I've only looked into this for about the last hour of my life and I can already see that stock is going to come crumbling down. CANN is essentially a major marijuana consulting/solutions company. They provide security for grow-ops, retail space for dispensaries, raising capital for emerging companies, sell industry research, etc. They don't actually sell MJ, they don't grow MJ, so the growth of this company is solely based on the EXISTENCE of other companies to purchase their information products and services.

With that being said, even if legal marijuana passes in all 5 states, where it was previously illegal, meaning NO established companies prior to the election...CANN cannot and will not grow in any way shape or form due to the legalization of marijuana in these five states in the short term. They will remain the exact same size due to the value of their existing contracts/leases in california, washington, colorado, and oregon and the company will have absolutely 0 value added if it passes come election time. Therefor this insanely inflated stock price is going to come crashing the fuck down, because its solely based on idiots. This is 3% institutionally owned as well, meaning even the big guys know there is no money to be made here and that leads me to believe there is not much long term growth either. However if you are an optimist, LT outlook may be good for these guys IF it passes in all 5 states but CANN won't start to grow until companies in each respective state get started and start scaling. 

 Personally, right after the election, your boy here is going to take out a FAT short position in this stock and make out like a bandit. See y'all in my fuckin lambo paid for by the dumb fuck stoners that are like ""hey mannnnn lets invest in CANN cuz 5 more legals states means 5x the industry size righhhhhhtttttt? *puff*

It says that the goal is to eliminate the risk of losing a lot of money in unpredictable economic environments. Essentially the fund will perform pretty well in the long term by following the strategy. 

How does this strategy work. On page 5 of the following whitepaper: https://www.bridgewater.com/resources/all-weather-story.pdf 

I can't seem to understand the 4x4 matrix regarding allocating money into the all weather portfolio based on risk as opposed to the funds.

16-10-13,57b0mf,"TODAY'S KEY WATCH LIST","The best stock to watch VOXX
 I only have one stock on this watchlist because VOXX is the best opportunity I see for the day, and will also teach you a lot about my “Gap Close strategy.
VOXX surged 50%+ today off a great earnings report, all time lows of VOXX are $2.10 it recently bottomed @ $2.50 then spiked to $3.95 the RSI level on the daily is at 72, if you look through out the chart history it can get as high as 85 so this still has room to run.

After bouncing 40 cents above all time lows, VOXX has potential of being a multi day runner or longterm swing trade.

I will be using the “Gap Close Strategy” to predict where VOXX is heading, and I encourage you to use this strategy, and utilize this watchlist. You shouldn’t be waiting for me to alert this tomorrow.

What’s the gap close strategy? Once a stock closes a gap it’s known for having a one sided volatile move, here is how to use it on VOXX

5/16/2016 VOXX had a gap waiting to be filled @ $3.80, the gap was filled today. VOXX touched $3.95 slightly breaking out above the gap close, and then closed @ $3.80 in after hours, If $3.70 holds the bulls remain in control and VOXX is a strong buy, you can also buy the key breakouts at $3.80, and $3.95 with a stop loss @ $3.65

As long as $3.70 holds the bulls remain in control, now if $3.70 cracks the bears will take control and slowly fill the gap from $2.60s, this is very simple to do just follow the price targets mentioned in here.

If the bulls hold $3.70 here is the technical analysis for tomorrow: Key breakout $3.95 once it breaks $4.10, after that $4.50, if those resistance levels fail to break it will head back to the price level before. For example if $4.50 fails to break it’ll drop to $4.10, if it holds back to $4.50 etc

If the bears crack $3.70 the first drop will be to $3.50 then $3.30

To cut to the chase, VOXX is a strong buy if the price is above $3.70 with a stop loss @ $3.60 and the key breakout is $3.95

If VOXX cracks $3.70 it’s a great short selling opportunity, with a stop loss @ $3.85

This will offer a great risk/reward if you use tight stops, and it’s not about being right this is a one sided move it’s about recognizing the trend. So if you shorted VOXX @ $3.70 and get stopped out # $3.85 you should then buy VOXX it’s as simple as that.

On a setup like this it doesn’t matter if I tell you I’m bullish or bearish before the market opens, what matters is the strategy/analysis I just shared with you, the gap close strategy. One of the keys to using it is understanding the price, and the one sided trend. The beauty of it is if you failed to predict the trend and got stopped out for a small loss you can then switch sides, you gotta be quick though these are known for being volatile. I explained to you how to use it, I obviously don’t expect you to be a master at this strategy based off this post, it should help you out a lot thought. If you want to master my strategy you must study everything I give you weather it’s a blog post, video lessons, live stream etc, and then once you learned it practice it in the market and your confidence and success will boost over time as you gain experience.

16-10-13,57d74v,Between the floor and the ceiling there is oil and gold,"Facts:

Rate hike in dec is almost certain

60-40 chances hillary trumps trump

Less than a month for election day and 2 months for the rate hike

There is excess production of oil in the world - so much so that they had to artificially cap the output to keep prices high.

Theory for gold:

Dec hike is almost 50% priced in for gold. If democrats win, then, watch gold be 1100-1150 next month. Thats the floor- good time to buy by Dec. But there is this uncertainty that trump would come in and screw everything up for us, increasing the floor. I think gold will stay between 1300 - 1200 before elections and the results determine future direction.

As for oil, its prices are artificially determined by countries regulating them. I would think crude would continue to stay below 55-58 for a long time to come. Between the drama of cuts and no cuts, it would be a good idea to sell credit spreads on the ceiling and a floor of $40

Thoughts?

TLDR: sell credit spreads for gold to stay between 1300 - 1150 before Dec, and crude to stay between 55-40 long term.",6

16-10-13,57ddj7,WTF anyone else experience this with their Broker.,"Just to give you the background and then whats going on

So i opened a third account not that long ago because well basically there's stocks you are not allowed to buy in a TFSA and RRSP account in Canada, and options are restricted.

Now i lost my job 2 months ago and haven't been able to contribute into these accounts but made some smart moves and percentage wise killing it, up a quite bit relative to the amount started with.

This is where it get's weird, I take a look at the account the other day, all of a sudden i have all this Buying Power and $1.17 cash, all positions still there. Now this account Has BP or Buying Power, and basically what this does for me is allow my to free ride any trade i want with no consequence. it's not Credit. 

So i call my broker and the guy tells me it must be a dividend coming through, I chuckled a little at him and said ""there's no fucking way that's a dividend'' , then he tells me It's probably my margin, in which I inform him the account doesn't have margin. He puts me on hold for like 10 fucking minutes, comes back and say's, It's not margin, it's not credit, they're allowing me to free ride x amount of dollars as long as i covered by the time the trade settles.

Is this normal?

Now, I've been shopping around a little bit, and understand enough of the markets to have narrowed down my picks to USAA, IB, and Optionhouse, but I'm looking to see if anyone has some experience with the advantages and disadvantages of the platforms, and what I should be considering before I take the plunge off the peir.

1) USAA. Commission is pretty gnarley, but through family assistance, I will be trading at the reduced commission rate of ~$6 pretty consistantly. Gives advance currency exchanges for trading foreign companies, and seems to have a competent, if not exactly sleek UI. Can't figure out how to access options on it though. I'm told they have very good fulfillment and instantanious placement times for orders, but I'm not sure how relevant that is.

2) Interactive Brokers: Lowest comissions of the 3, until I start playing with bigboys numbers, and won't need y'alls advisories, so don't worry about that. From what I can see, they're inconveniant as fuck, but you get what you don't pay for. I am &lt;25, so I only need 3k to open an account with them, and that's not a problem. They don't do forex/futures (don't remember which), but that's fine cause I'm not interested in those yet.

3) Optionshouse: Somewhere between the previous two. Reasonable commission rates, very competative options trading rates, but not much said about them in the fors-or-againsts. Going into this one mostly blind.

Can anyone add any significant DDs on these brokers that I should be considering, or even feilding some of their own? I'm done with Robinhood and it's buggy piece of fuckery that not even an autistic faggot like me can abide.

[Steve uses Libya as an example](http://fintekneeks.com/even-dictators-lose-money-to-bad-investments/) - but even Goldman Sachs, who he mentions as benefiting from their advice to Libya, said that gold would fall to $1100 an ounce by May and it never did - [evidence of this](http://archive.is/a3CLd):

&gt;“We maintain our view of rising U.S. rates and hence lower gold prices, with a 3-month target of $1,100 per once and 12-month target of $1,000 per ounce,” they wrote.

Rates still haven't risen.

A big company, a powerful politician, and a credentialed academic do not control reality and never will.  They *might* be able to manipulate events in their favor for a season, like we saw in the Soviet Union, but reality will eventually force everyone to capitulate.

For my own investment tolerance, this means that I risk money only in low-priced sectors/areas/stocks/investment opportunities while realizing that there's still no guarantee of future success.

I've been trying to figure out for a while now wether or not TA works. Many say it does, many say it doesn't. There is a great video criticising TA right here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1Jb8EvNKug . 
The points he makes seem extremely valid to me, and I also find it hard to believe TA works. However, there is such a thing as a self fulfilling prophecy; if enough people/funds use TA, it is bound to work since people buy at support etc etc. There's even a broker I know that uses technical analysis to strategize their funds, so how does this make sense?

Also the guy from the video in an interview (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBpPGAJD7gw @10.40) tries to explain that if TA worked, and virtually anybody can make money off of it, the profits would be arbitraged away by institutional traders/investors. How would that work then? If the self fulfilling prophecy holds, and people buy at the same levels, prices would rise, so how does that get ""arbitraged away"" ? 

tl;dr - Does TA work, why or why not?

* DoubleLine Low Duration Bond Fund Class N(MUTF:DLSNX)
* American Century California Intermediate-Term Tax-Free Bond Fund Investor Class(MUTF:BCITX)

I am suspicious because these expense ratios seem high, at  .69% and .47%.  I asked about those and the answer was to just ignore them and look at returns, which doesn't decrease my suspicion.  I do not actually know how the rep gets paid.  The brokerage does not operate/run/offer any of these funds, or any funds at all, so it doesn't seem to be a case of just steering me toward their own products.

I do not understand a whole lot about how to compare bond funds or how to assess their risk.  It seems like running a bond fund should be fairly mechanical so the expenses should not be super high, but idk.  I understand that if new bond rates increase then the asset value of a fund holding lower rate bonds will decrease, and that funds with short term bonds will bounce back faster.  But other than those two things, I really don't understand the risks or how to evaluate and compare bond funds.

I would love to see lower expense bond funds with similar profiles to these so I can see if the returns are actually better despite the increased expenses.  But there are a zillion bond funds, I'm not sure how to find that.

16-10-15,57jwkr,Looking for advice on choosing funds for 401k,"Hey guys,

I'm 23 and have recently graduated and started working full time. My company has a great 401k done through Prudential Retirement, immediately vested and contributes 7% if I contribute 6% (13% combined total), so I will definitely do that. From what I understand the best choice for saving for retirement is to max out my contribution to HSA, then employer match for 401k, then max out contribution to roth IRA, then put any remainder into 401k. The choice now is which funds to choose and how much to put in each.

The fund options for my 401k are (Expense Ratio %):

* Guaranteed Income Fund (Stable Value) (0.10)
* Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Adm (Fixed Income - Intermediate Bond) (0.06)
* Western Asset Core Plus Bond IS (Fixed Income - Intermediate Bond) (0.42)
* SA/Oakmark Equity &amp; Income Strategy (Balanced - Value) (0.57)
* Large Cap Value / LSV Asset Management (Large Cap Stock - Value) (0.62)
* Dryden S&amp;P 500 Index Fund (Large Cap Stock - Blend) (0.10)
* MainStay Large Cap Growth R1 (Large Cap Stock - Growth) (0.84)
* Goldman Sachs Mid Cap Value Instl (Mid Cap Stock - Value) (0.75)
* Vanguard Extended Market Idx Adm (Mid Cap Stock - Blend) (0.09)
* Victory Munder Mid-Cap Core Growth R6 (Mid Cap Stock - Growth) (0.88)
* Delaware Small Cap Value Instl (Small Cap Stock - Value) (0.96)
* Loomis Sayles Small Cap Growth Instl (Small Cap Stock - Growth) (0.94)
* American Funds Capital World Gr&amp;Inc R5 (Global Stock - Blend) (0.49)
* American Funds Europacific Growth R5 (International Stock - Growth) (0.54)
* Oppenheimer Developing Markets I (International Stock - Emerging Markets) (0.87)

I currently have a few investments of my own with Vanguard, and I've been happy with them. The Prudential website recommends the following for me:

* Large Cap Stock - Value: 19%
* International Stock: 36%
* Large Cap Stock - Growth: 19%
* Sm/Mid Cap Stock - Value: 13%
* Sm/Mid Cap Stock - Growth: 13%

I kinda like Vanguard and don't really know many of the others (and 36% international stock seems really high), so currently I'm thinking of the following:

* Dryden S&amp;P 500 Index Fund (Large Cap Stock - Blend): 35%
* Vanguard Extended Market Idx Adm (Mid Cap Stock - Blend): 30%
* Delaware Small Cap Value Instl (Small Cap Stock - Value): 15%
* Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Adm (Fixed Income - Intermediate Bond): 10%
* American Funds Europacific Growth R5 (International Stock - Growth): 5%
* American Funds Capital World Gr&amp;Inc R5 (Global Stock - Blend): 5%

16-10-14,57hnqi,John Maynard Keynes: Courage Is the Key to Investing,"[Link for those with a WSJ account](http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/10/14/john-maynard-keynes-courage-is-the-key-to-investing/)

&gt; The next time the stock market crashes, we will all step forward and buy stocks boldly — at least in our imaginations.

&gt; But buying stocks when the market collapses is far harder to do than to imagine. New research looks at how the great economist — and equally great investor — John Maynard Keynes waded into the wake of the Great Crash of 1929, when U.S. stocks fell by more than 80% from peak to trough. His experience should teach all investors the importance of preparation, courage and patience.

&gt; Between the early 1920s and his death in 1946, Keynes wrote several books, revolutionized economic policy and helped devise the modern global monetary system. In his spare time, he managed the endowment of King’s College at the University of Cambridge. From 1922 through 1946, Keynes’ stock portfolio outperformed the U.K. stock market by an average of nearly six percentage points annually — over a period covering the worst market crash, the worst economic depression and the worst war in modern history.

&gt; Keynes didn’t look like a great investor all the time. As what we today call a value investor, focused on buying stocks at bargain prices, he got left behind in the torrid bull market of the 1920s. Keynes didn’t see the Great Depression coming; he went into the Crash of 1929 with roughly 90% of the college’s funds in stocks even though, at the time, most other endowments overwhelmingly preferred bonds.

&gt; By late 1929 Keynes had cumulatively underperformed the British stock market by 40 percentage points over the preceding five years.

&gt; But he was already turning his performance around.

&gt; In a new research paper in Business History Review, an academic journal, finance professor David Chambers of Cambridge’s Judge Business School and economist Ali Kabiri of the University of Buckingham analyze how Keynes mustered the courage to invest heavily in U.S. stocks devastated by the crash and the ensuing depression.

&gt; Keynes had almost entirely ignored U.S. stocks in the college’s endowment until September 1930. What a time to get interested! The U.S. stock market had fallen 38.4% over the preceding 12 months. But Keynes was so excited by the bargains he saw opening up in the U.S. that he worked with a small New York brokerage, Case Pomeroy &amp; Co., to research the market and his own stock ideas. In 1931, when U.S. stocks fell a bloodcurdling 47.1%, and again in 1934, when they dropped another 5.9%, Keynes traveled to the U.S., spending much of his time meeting people on Wall Street, in government and in business who could help him research his investment ideas.

&gt; He bought U.S. stocks throughout the depression. When they fell another 38.6% in 1937, Keynes, undaunted, bought still more. By 1939, he had put half his main portfolio for the college in U.S. companies, favoring high-dividend-paying preferred stocks, investment trusts (diversified stock portfolios similar to today’s mutual funds) and, later on, public utilities. He focused on a small number of stocks trading at low multiples of their value as businesses, often hanging on for eight years or more until their stock prices finally rose to reflect those asset values.

&gt; Chapter 12 of Keynes’ book “The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money,” which he wrote 80 years ago, remains one of the most concentrated bursts of brilliance anyone has ever brought to bear on investing. His words still ring with the resolve it must have taken to buy when blood was running in the streets:

&gt; “The spectacle of modern investment markets has sometimes moved me towards the conclusion that to make the purchase of an investment permanent and indissoluble, like marriage, except by reason of death or other grave cause, might be a useful remedy for our contemporary evils. For this would force the investor to direct his mind to the long-term prospects and to those only.”

&gt; Keynes understood, as did his contemporary, the American value investor Benjamin Graham, that bear markets are so unpredictable that reliably sidestepping them is nearly impossible — and that the pain of losing money is nearly unbearable.

&gt; Still, Keynes knew, barging into bear markets to buy, rather than trying to sidestep them, is the way to prevail. Since, over the long run, stocks tend to go up more than they go down, one of the greatest advantages an investor can have is the gumption to buy stocks aggressively in falling markets.

&gt; That requires both cash and courage.

&gt; With stocks still not far from their record highs today, sitting on some cash is a better idea than ever.

&gt; And — unless you’re in or near retirement, in which case you should probably be scaling back on stocks already — steel your courage. Write a binding contract with yourself, witnessed by a friend or family member, committing you to buy more stocks when they fall 25%, 50% or more. Years from now, you’ll be glad you did.",3

# Description
The J. M. Smucker Company is a manufacturer and marketer of branded food and beverage products and pet food and pet snacks in North America. The Company's segments include U.S. Retail Coffee, U.S. Retail Consumer Foods, U.S. Retail Pet Foods, and International and Foodservice.

You'll know the brands, for sure! Folgers, Pillsbury, Cross &amp; Blackwell, even Dunkin Donut's coffee is theirs!

Coffee is 29% of sales; US Consumer is also 29%, Pets 29% and International the remaining 13%. Though it's fair to say the coffee business has the best margin at 29% versus the overall business on 23%.

## Recent financials 

Sales were flat for much of the last 5 years with a substantial jump in the year to April 2016.

|April year end |2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $7.8bn | $5.7bn | $5.6bn | $5.9bn | $5.5bn|
|EPS | $5.76 | $3.33 | $5.42 | $5.00 | $4.06|

And what caused the jump? They acquired *Big Heart*. If they hadn't sales would have been up just 3%. And if you are wondering what Big Heart does, it's the Pet Food business.

## Competition

There's a long list of competitors but the table below covers the big ones that are on the stock market. Hardly an apples-to-apples comparison, but then again none of these businesses resemble each other perfectly.

Of course the thing that stands out to me is it's great margin. In line with Kraft.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
J M Smucker Co | $7,675M | 23% | 10%
Kraft Heinz Co | $26,607M | 24% | 5%
Hormel Foods Corp | $9,296M | 15% | 20%
ConAgra Foods Inc | $11,512M | 15% | 14%
Pinnacle Foods Inc | $2,869M | 19% | 11%
General Mills, Inc. | $16,263M | 21% | 34%

## Cash / Debt?

J M Smucker Co has $5,242M of net debt. That is 3x it's latest operating profit. Wow, must have been a pricey buy that pet food.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $148.82 for J M Smucker Co and their recommendation to clients is _Hold_. That implies an upside of 11% to their target.

# Valuation

Given the business hasn't really grown the top line in 4 of the last 5 years, its a bit odd that the forecast is a 10% earnings growth. But Wall Street must have it reasons! If they are onto something then 17x doesn't seem excessive for the growth.

PF | $5,852M | 23x | 9% | 2% | 7%
GIS | $36,796M | 20x | 7% | 3% | 9%

# Dividends

J M Smucker Co is forecast to pay a dividend of $2.88 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $2.76 per share. That is a 4% growth. The forecast dividend of $2.88 compares to a forecast EPS of $7.68. So plenty of room to pay down debt.


# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -12% that compares with no change in the earnings forecasts. That's against a backdrop of sales down 7% for the latest quarter. 

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers they said

&gt;  net sales decreased 5% compared to 2016. This decline was largely planned due to a cumulative 12% list price decrease for coffee across most of the quarter and lapping the prior-year roll out of Dunkin’ Donuts K-Cups. Lower Pet Foods sale also contributed.

They went on to say they expect softness to continue for the year. 

What I can't judge is whether this is *structural softness* or *temporary*. Anyone have a view?

So I have a few questions about buying a second home. My current home's value is ~$800,000 but we still have about $100,000 left to pay back to the bank. The banker said I could still borrow another $400,000 max against the house if I wanted to. 

Our current payments total around $3000/month for the house that includes utilities and the loan. 

I've been pondering the idea of buying a second home as an investment home to solely rent out. 
So one idea I had was to search for an investment property, if I did find a good one that was easy to rent out. I would borrow the remaining $400,000 to use as a down payment for that investment home and then rent it out. Am I missing a reason why I shouldn't consider doing this? 

Are there any reasons why I shouldn't think this way?",1

Some it seems tax related and some of it isn't. For instance, in 2011, they incurred $79M in costs in regards to a restructure in a subsidiary, and this is recorded as a loss in the 2011 IS but the 2011 CF it is added back to the cash flows. In 2011 there was a tax benefit recorded as income but deducted from net income in the CF. Similar story for 2012.

Why is this done and how does it make any sense that this is done?

EDIT AND ANSWER: So basically what I think was going on was that there were some restructure and impairment charges that worked against income, but worked like depreciation where there was no actual cash outflow, so in 2010 these needed to be added back to cash flows. In 2011 there was a tax benefit realized but as a result of operations in another period so that had to be subtracted from cash flows. In 2012, there was an expense as a result of a previous period, so that had to be added back to cash flows.

Let me know if that makes sense.",38

*****

&gt; ###Corporate earnings, economic reports and Fed speakers could all challenge markets in the week ahead, but traders will be on guard for the latest catalyst — the potential bombshells coming from the presidential election.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###Earnings are expected from about 80 S&amp;P companies, including Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, McDonald's and American Express. According to Thomson Reuters, earnings for the S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to be nearly flat for the third quarter — down just 0.4 percent after a year of negative earnings reports.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###Data in the coming week includes industrial production Monday, the Fed's beige book Wednesday, but most importantly CPI consumer inflation data Tuesday, after producer prices perked up more than expected in September.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###Stocks in the past week were lower, with the S&amp;P 500 down nearly 1 percent at 2,132, the Dow down 0.6 percent at 18.138, and the Nasdaq off 1.5 percent at 5,214. In the past week, the market became vulnerable for the first time to the idea that Donald Trump's controversial behavior and sparring with Republicans could hurt GOP Congressional candidates.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###While traders give it low odds, there was speculation in the past week that Democrat Hillary Clinton could sweep in with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate. The conventional thinking is that Clinton will win and Republicans will hold one if not two houses. Markets prefer gridlock over one party control, especially Democratic control since they are viewed as more likely to adopt stiffer regulations and less favorable tax policy.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###Trump has fallen in the polls since the revelation of a tape where he was making lewd and aggressive remarks about women. The final presidential debate is scheduled for Wednesday night.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: October options expiration prone to wild swings**
&gt; Since 1994, the Monday of options expiration week has a bullish bias for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000. Expiration day however, tends to be mixed with average losses across the board even though S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have advanced more often than not. Entire expiration week and the week after also lean bullish. Of note is the small-cap index streak of 13 straight advances from 1994 through 2006 (not shown, the streak is actually 17 years starting in 1990) and it has been down in six of the last nine years. October’s reputation for volatility can be seen with wild daily and weekly swings in the tables below. Weekly moves in excess of 5% occurred in 1998, 2002, 2008 and 2011.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: DJIA performs best under newly elected Democrat Presidents**
&gt; In the below chart, “All Post-Election” years since 1953 is the baseline to which “All 1st Elected,” “Dem 1st Elected,” and “Rep 1st Elected” are compared. “All 1st Elected” years are the first years of a new president. “Dem 1st Elected” are first years of a new president that was a Democrat and “Rep 1st Elected” are new Republican presidents. For the first half of a post-election year all four are quite close. Under 1st Elected Democrats DJIA was weaker in January and February on average as a result of early losses in 2009. By the end of July DJIA’s performance begins to show significant deviation and by the end of the year DJIA has performed best under a newly elected, 1st-year Democrat. Should polls hold and Hillary Clinton become the next President, DJIA’s performance in 2017 could resemble the green line. If Donald Trump can defy odds and polls then DJIA could follow the path of the black line.

16-10-16,57qsq7,"Tesla's Resale Value Guarantee - How will it affect next earnings?","Hi,

I originally posted this is in the accounting subreddit but no one has been able to answer the question just yet. I was hoping that lads in the investing subreddit could provide their opinions.

Since April 2013, Tesla has provided a financing option for its car called the Resale Value Guarantee. Basically, it allowed buyers to choose this so that they would be sure that the value of the car would be worthwhile after 36-39 months, and else they could return the car. This is what Tesla's income statement in 2013 reports:

""In April 2013, we began offering a resale value guarantee to all customers who purchased a Model S in the United States and financed their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners. Under the program, Model S customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the period of 36 to 39 months after delivery for a pre-determined resale value. Although we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery, we account for transactions under the resale value guarantee program as operating leases. Accordingly, we defer and amortize to automotive sales revenue the initial purchase consideration less resale value guarantee amount on a straight-line basis, over the contractual term of the guarantee program. Similarly, we capitalize and depreciate the cost of the respective operating lease vehicles less resale value guarantee amount to cost of automotive sales over the same period. If a customer decides not to sell their vehicle back to us by the end of the resale value guarantee term, any unamortized deferred revenue and operating lease vehicle net book value is then recognized in automotive sales and cost of automotive sales, respectively.

The resale value guarantee amount represents management’s best estimate as to the resale value of the Model S vehicle and related vehicle options during the 36 to 39 month period after delivery. Since we are depreciating our operating lease vehicles to the resale value guarantee amount, we will adjust our depreciation estimates as needed, if the resale value is projected to be lower in future periods. As we accumulate more actual data related to the resale experience of Model S, we may be required to make significant changes to our estimates.

As of June 30, 2013, we recorded $75.2 million in deferred revenues and $72.4 million in other long-term liabilities related to Model S deliveries with the resale value guarantee and recorded $123.9 million in operating lease vehicles, net. During the three months ended June 30, 2013, we recognized revenue of $1.9 million in automotive sales and $1.4 million in cost of automotive sales related to this program.""
/END

GAAP forces them to treat this as a lease. I wonder if you could help me translate what this message means. How much revenue was attributed to the RVG back then? The 75.2 million in deferred revenues? What are the 72.4 million in other liabilities? And what is the 123.9 million in 'operating lease vehicles', why is it smaller than this total?

I am trying to figure out how this will affect Tesla's Q3 earnings. It will be the first time that the 39 month program will add a chunk of revenue other than the monthly leases. Assuming no one returns their car, how this affect Tesla's upcoming revenue/COGS or balance sheet?

I hope you can help me out. Figured it's an interesting accounting puzzle.

16-10-15,57m8qr,"Seeking info on the CBOE-SMLC, a social media index using Social Market Analytics' Sentiment scores; or a social sentiment etf","Basically, Social Market Analytics (SMA) creates this product whereby they grade the social media sentiment of stocks based on info coming out of Stocktwits and Twitter, and then assign S-scores to stocks. When S-scores are two standard deviations above the norm, the stock starts to move. The theory is that the sentiment of a stock can be predictive of the price move of a stock. 

So together with the Chicago Board of Options exchange, they launched a fund, the CBOE-SMA Large-Cap Index (SMLC Index) earlier this year. I'll admit that I was intrigued and impressed at how it performed relative to the S&amp;P500 in high volatility environments, even though there is relatively little data so far. It seems to outperform the market even when it's down, which is interesting – it's not just a riskier version of a basket of large caps. More info [here](http://www.cboe.com/micro/smlc/smlc-index-qrg.pdf) and [here](http://www.cboe.com/micro/smlc/). 

I'm interested in putting a small percentage of my portfolio in this fund. But for the life of me I can't figure out how. I use capitalone as my brokerage and I can't find it using the ticker. 

Is it simply a fund that's not available to retail investors? Does anyone know of any other similar products? I'm very interested in finding a 'Social Sentiment ETF' for instance... I don't want to day trade based on the raw data but instead just take a long position in an aggregate fund, because I think the technology is robust. Anyone have any suggestions? 

Edit: ok it's not a fund, it appears to be an index. So it's not investable. I'm looking for something like this. Doesn't haven't to be SMA. Could be one of their competitors, ravenpack or contix or dataminr or what have you. I'm just most impressed with SMA after looking in to all of their methodologies. I assume there are hedge funds that include this strategy into their analysis, although sentiment is newer and more sophisticated than simple event driven analysis, so I'm guessing there are more operating in that space. I know a fund was launched a couple years ago tracking overall investor mood, (and betting on spy iirc) but that was kind of an absurd idea and it folded after a month. im looking for a fund that aggregates high performing sentiment equities on a short term basis, and that retail investors specifically can invest in. Haven't found anything like that so far. Maybe there's a gap in the market there?",7

TL:DR: Look or or else you'll get eaten by a dropbear.

Cisco is currently down 4.5% from current highs. The goods news about Cisco is that they have lots of options volume so either way this post sways you, you can make a move on it.

Cisco's level of public interest is very low right now, but it always swings back. Also their earnings is gaining some interest (it's on Nov 11th after market close).

They've got jelly in all the right places, financially. They're down mostly because of a few minor rumors about sales and such but a major force behind this pull back is the overall market being shaky. Hillary is in the lead now so expect dovish tones from the FOMC and smooth sailing upward.

A major problem their company faces is their Frankenstein lookalike CEO. He's very creepy looking and likely drives down sales purely because no one wants him to destroy their bride, then have him force you to bring her back to life so he can have someone to love (this was a mean joke and I'm sorry to all parties involved both directly and indirectly).

The analysts have been trying to paint a bleak outlook on this company based on options volume. It's ridiculous, but if your boss says trash Cisco, you trash Cisco. Besides the volume being mostly speculation, they're forgetting that there are other people on opposite sides of those trades. While the crooked analysts help a little with pushing the stock down, its definitely the overall market and sales rumors that are pulling this thing down. I would say to follow the trend that the analysts are setting, but they're mostly from second rate organisations feeding third rate journalists (to be fair they're closer to bloggers) fundamentally distorted and dishonest viewpoints. 

Now back to the part about Hillary's lead and the market outlook. While Trump is certainly coming back from the attacks that he's been facing head on, the media is not going to let up. Maybe the polling is rigged, maybe it isn't, but up until election day the media will say she's winning and ignore any new information that comes out about her. If Monday looks red for CSCO then wait till Thursday or Friday to load up on calls or equity, but if it looks green then try and get in on a low point. We're at the point where Nov 11th is fast approaching so the stocks IV will be rising and so will the shares in anticipation of a massive beat.",22

I know the whole idea of the market is its never to early to start,  but the S and P 500 has had a 28% rate or return in the last 7.5 years, which is clearly unsustainable. 

Everyone who began investing in 2009 has had great returns and can feel good about just leaving their money in there at this point, but I missed out on all those golden years because I was still in school.

I am debating now if I had to bet if the market were to go up 20% or 20% down which would happen first it would have to be the later.  If it went up 20% more percent would that not just mean a bubble were more likely? The market is looking for any excuse to sell right now and it seems like every other individual stock has gone up 600% in the past 7 years.  

Is the golden age of crazy returns on investing over or should I just put all my life savings in a broad ETF now and not worry about my gut feeling.  Can anyone give me a compelling bull reason to invest right now?

16-10-16,57rzmz,"Re-examining Berkshire Hathaway's alleged manipulation of Dow Chemical stock","This came up once before on here, but it didn't really get a full discussion. It's a very interesting topic and I think it has a rare obvious upside for long investors. 

In August, it was [reported](http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/08/31/dow-chemicals-1-in-1000-stock-action-works-in-warren-buffetts-favor/) that a Yale professor had found pretty clear evidence that the price of $DOW was being manipulated. It would hit a ceiling multiple times, barely ever going above $53.72, despite hovering around there frequently. This is visually evident from this [six month](http://imgur.com/a/566bR) and [three month] (http://imgur.com/a/Q9gub) view. Here's a [histogram](http://online.wsj.com/media/dowhisto0831.jpg) of closing prices from 2014 to 2016. Pretty obvious manipulation right? That distribution should be closer to normal. 

Now, due to the Dupont merger talk, the price closed above the threshold 9 times. What's the significance of $53.72? Well back in 2009, Warren Buffett struck a deal with Dow for 3 bn to get preferred stock that happened to come with an 8.5% dividend. That yields a solid ~$225 m per annum for Warren. The deal has a buyback clause though. If the share price trades over ... you guessed it... $53.72 twenty times in a 30-day period, Dow gets its stock back and doesn't owe that 8.5% dividend anymore. So while Warren might have had some September jitters over the loss of his stake, 9 times wasn't enough to trigger the buyback. Phew. 

Some analysts say that Warren/BRK aren't exactly passive observers in all this. That they deliberately shorted the stock with enough capital that they drove down the price whenever it threatened to hit the threshold. It seems likely from the study done by the professor. It's not illegal, just shady. The agreement BRK signed prohibited them from shorting the stock until April 2014. Which just precedes the suspicious activity. Coincidence? It's a classic Buffett move - either he keeps his juicy dividend or is forced to sell at 53, having bought at 6. 

The conclusion for us should be somewhat evident: **go long on Dow**. Or buy puts (I don't trade options, so I'm not exactly sure of the mechanism here). If the price is being artificially suppressed, it stands to reason that it's undervalued and that its fundamentals will eventually win out. Buffett can't keep it up forever. 

Some discussion questions: 

* Does the Dupont merger completely overshadow the significance of this price suppression?   
* Do you believe that Dow's price is being manipulated?  
* If it is, is that immediate cause for a buy?   
* Will it cease now due to the bedding in period of the merger?  
* How best to exploit this?

Disclosure: I don't have a stake in Dow, but I am strongly considering taking one. They pay a nice 3.4% dividend and have near-monopolistic control of their industry. Economies of scale are massive. I haven't fully investigated the implications of the merger yet though. Interested to hear your thoughts. 

Edit 2: I was totally wrong about a bunch of stuff, including Dow's market share and how to trade options. Still learning...",230

IMO (which may be wrong), small companies are always volatile, revenue growth inconsistent etc. They are weak in financials, mostly running with borrowed money (not cash rich), weak to sustain during economic troubles.

I may be missing, if I continue to think so, major growth part as some  of small companies growth may be stronger, like amazon was a small cap at one time.

Do you invest/focus on small cap less than 1B? Where do I focus, like filters etc, to find stronger companies for long term, more than 5 years, success?

To start with, I wanted to focus US based companies between $500M and 2B range and stock price more than $5 (do not like penny stocks). I prefer to have 20% (appx 20k) of my portfolio for this.

16-10-17,57wadg,Buyers Line Up For Barrick Gold Corporation (USA) – NYSE: $ABX – $1 Billion Asset,"While buyers line up for Barrick Gold Corporation (USA) (NYSE:ABX)’s $1 Billion Asset, a small cap gold mining stock that is quitely gaining traction is Bullfrog Gold Corp (OTCMKTS:BFGC). Recently, Bullfrog Gold had announced additional land acquisition next to its Bullfrog Project in Nevada. While gold and the mining end of the business remains a mystery to many investors, those who watch the markets are looking for opportunities in domestic producing areas. 

Barrick Gold Corporation (USA) (NYSE:ABX) has decided to sell its stake in the Kalgoorlie Super Pit mine in Western Australia and a growing number of potential buyers are showing interest in grabbing the asset. Kalgoorlie is a joint venture between Barrick and Newmont Mining Corp (NYSE:NEM). Barrick owns 50% stake in the mine and the sale of that stake could generate $1 billion in proceeds for the company, sources have hinted.


Potential buyers

Potential buyers of Barrick’s 50% stake in Kalgoorlie mine have until the end of this month to place their bids. It is not clear whether Barrick has started receiving bids for the asset, but Kinross Gold Corporation (USA) (NYSE:KGC) and Zijin Mining Group, a former buyer of another Barrick asset, are among miners that have shown interest in Barrick’s stake in Kalgoorlie mine. The other companies that are reviewing data on the mine for possible bids include Australian miners Evolution Mining, Newcrest Mining and Northern Star Resources. Newcrest Mining is the partner of Barrick in the joint venture and the operator of the mine. Chinese miners Shandong Gold Mining and China National Gold Group are also said to be considering bids for ABX’s 50% stake in Kalgoorlie mine. Since taking over greater responsibility to operation Kalgoorlie mine, Newmont has improved the mines production and cost efficiency.


Gold deals

This year has been awash with deal-making in the gold sector as miners try to increase capacity or drop down costs to boost profitability. In 3Q2016, some 140 gold-themed acquisitions took place, making the quarter the busiest since 2010 in term of the number of transactions completed. Gold prices are up about 18% so far in 2016, but worries about interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve have tempered with the rally in gold prices in the recent weeks. Barrick stock is up nearly 115% YTD. The stock rose 2% to $15.83 in the last session.

16-10-16,57tbd0,Buy the Cisco dip,"I'm saying this as an Australian, so take that fact into consideration when reading this post.

TL:DR: Look or or else you'll get eaten by a dropbear.

Cisco is currently down 4.5% from current highs. The goods news about Cisco is that they have lots of options volume so either way this post sways you, you can make a move on it.

Cisco's level of public interest is very low right now, but it always swings back. Also their earnings is gaining some interest (it's on Nov 11th after market close).

They've got jelly in all the right places, financially. They're down mostly because of a few minor rumors about sales and such but a major force behind this pull back is the overall market being shaky. Hillary is in the lead now so expect dovish tones from the FOMC and smooth sailing upward.

A major problem their company faces is their Frankenstein lookalike CEO. He's very creepy looking and likely drives down sales purely because no one wants him to destroy their bride, then have him force you to bring her back to life so he can have someone to love (this was a mean joke and I'm sorry to all parties involved both directly and indirectly).

The analysts have been trying to paint a bleak outlook on this company based on options volume. It's ridiculous, but if your boss says trash Cisco, you trash Cisco. Besides the volume being mostly speculation, they're forgetting that there are other people on opposite sides of those trades. While the crooked analysts help a little with pushing the stock down, its definitely the overall market and sales rumors that are pulling this thing down. I would say to follow the trend that the analysts are setting, but they're mostly from second rate organisations feeding third rate journalists (to be fair they're closer to bloggers) fundamentally distorted and dishonest viewpoints.

Now back to the part about Hillary's lead and the market outlook. While Trump is certainly coming back from the attacks that he's been facing head on, the media is not going to let up. Maybe the polling is rigged, maybe it isn't, but up until election day the media will say she's winning and ignore any new information that comes out about her. If Monday looks red for CSCO then wait till Thursday or Friday to load up on calls or equity, but if it looks green then try and get in on a low point. We're at the point where Nov 11th is fast approaching so the stocks IV will be rising and so will the shares in anticipation of a massive beat.",7

I have recently bought a few stocks including Deutsche Bank, BMW, Siemens, Philips and Gemalto.

1 week after the investment: Deutsche Bank increased by 4,57% (i read about the struggles they had and knew the stock must be low right now so i bought it.)

Now, all the other stocks i bought fell and now i am stuck with negative numbers. 

Question: 
What do I do with the negative stocks in my depot?
Do I leave them in my account until they are positive again or should I sell the small loss quickly to avoid an even bigger loss?

Thanks in advance.

Why do so many people attribute it to skill? How are people so deluded? Do they have low IQ's? 

I mean yeah, I think many people know this and invest because they know it's possible for them to be an outlier based on luck. 

But with the above assumption, why does anyone try to understand investing in-depth, is it because Warren Buffet thinks his restraint and book knowledge made him successful? He's no different than Terrence Tao. 

IMO you should only learn about investing if you find it more fun than playing video games, socializing, learning about subjects that are actually productive, etc. 

All the books, all the knowledge and intelligence will not make you anymore successful than a monkey randomly picking stocks. if you think otherwise, I think you're DELUDED, OVERCONFIDENT and BORED. 

THE MARKET IS EFFICIENT. 
There are MILLIONS of TRADERS with the SAME POOL OF INFORMATION. Your perception/interpretation of the information will not CHANGE SHIT because there are MILLIONS of investors/traders. 


tl;dr; spending your time on anything excluding investing would be smart. Unless you like being delusional or truly enjoy analyzing companies... or if you're aware of the above and know that it's possible to be an outlier. WallstreetBets is lightyears ahead of you guys. 

Edit: Ignore ""billionaire status"" in the title.

# Description

Alibaba Group is engaged in online and mobile commerce. It provides retail and wholesale marketplaces available through both personal computer and mobile interfaces in the PRC and internationally. 

Retail marketplaces and services operated by the Company include the China online shopping destination (Taobao Marketplace); the China brands and retail platform (Tmall); the China group buying site that offers products by aggregating demand from consumers through limited time discounted sales (Juhuasuan), and the global consumer marketplace targeting consumers (AliExpress).

In a rough comparison you could say it's like Amazon. Though I get the impression it's not an entirely fair comparison. Why? They also have a relationship with the ""Paypal"" of China, Alipay. Where they will be entitled to a big cash payment if &amp; when it IPOs.

## Recent financials 

They report in RMB/Yuan, So beware the table! The last figure is in US$ 

|Year to March |2013A|2014A|2015A|2016A|US$|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | RMB 35bn | RMB 53bn | RMB 76bn | RMB 101bn | US$ 16bn|
|EPS | RMB 3.57 | RMB 10.0 | RMB 9.7 | RMB 27.9 | $4.33|

* What's the revenue split? 83% is the China e-commerce business. 8% international commerce. 3% cloud computing and 6% is other.
* Where's the growth? Well, in the last year the business added RMB 25 bn in sales. With 90% of the growth coming from the domestic e-commerce business...

So frankly, it's a China China China story. And not a lot else.

## Competition

In the same why that Amazon is fighting Google, Facebook and Wal-mart. Alibaba has the domestic equivalents, like Tencent, JD.com and Baidu to fight with.

It's margins and returns are pretty good compared with the domestic peers and versus the global ""big daddy"" Amazon they are *sweet*.

Apple Inc. | $220,288M | 34% | 38%
Amazon.com, Inc. | $120,637M | 9% | 14%

In fact it is fair to say the core margin is understated, as their cloud computing, innovations divisions and affiliates are currently loss making. 

## Cash / Debt?

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd has $1,259M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 0% of the market value of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. So nothing doing here.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $113.03 for Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 11% to their target.

# Valuation

Looking at valuation, at 31x forecast earnings, it's hardly sticker shock. The growth rates are good, their domestic position looks strong, and there's no signs of economic stress in China. Okay, they'd don't own WeChat, which gets columns of press in the west, but who cares! It's still a major success story.

# Dividends

No surprise that the $BABA is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. Though they do have a share buyback program and did acquire over $2bn of stock last year.

# Yahoo! Softbank and the Cayman Islands

The leading Japanese tech company Softbank owns 32% and the ex-leader Yahoo! owns 12%. I've no idea what their long term views are on the stock, but with Yahoo! carving itself up, there has to be some sort of corporate action / overhang coming in the medium term.

Lastly, when you buy BABA you are actually buying shares in a Cayman Island company. BABA conducts its businesses primarily through its subsidiaries and *variable interest entities*. 

&gt; ""variable interest entities"" are to our variable interest entities that are 100% owned by PRC citizens or by PRC entities owned by PRC citizens, where applicable, that hold the Internet content provider licenses, or ICP licenses, or other business operation licenses or approvals, and generally operate the various websites for our Internet businesses or other businesses in which foreign investment is restricted or prohibited, and are consolidated into our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP as if they were our wholly-owned subsidiaries

So in reality you aren't actually the legal owner of the underlying businesses, as Chinese regulations don't allow foreigners have these licenses!

It's a flag, a big one, but at the same time, even if you did have legal title in China, how'd you actually enforce it? 

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 23% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 3%. That's against the backdrop of 60% increase in sales in the latest quarter.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, they reiterated their 49% forecasts for sales growth this year, highlighted the continued great margin at the core, and the investments they are making for the future. 

So despite the hype that WeChat is becoming *the* Internet in China, there's no sign that it's hurting Alibaba's core business.

I am new to the trading world. I started off a couple of weeks ago with $500 and I'm up to $562. This is primarily me getting used to the market to get a feel for things before I can start putting in real money.

I am looking to do this long term. I'm in grad school studying analytics and see myself getting into quant trading but I am not too familiar with trading and the tricks of the trade.

I'm looking for someone who'd be down to discuss daily stocks, bets we're making and our rationales behind them. I think it'll help me and you learn better and quicker. It'll also help eliminate a lot of the biases we face when looking at stocks and making decisions as single individuals.

Since guns tend to hold their value quite well (provided they aren't shot very much/are well maintained), would it be reasonable to invest in some collectible firearms which have yet to reach their plateau? I was thinking about buying many Mosin Nagants, as they are still very cheap and have yet to increase in value like the other WW2 surplus rifles, and I was thinking about buying stamped Nazi Lugers as well.

16-10-17,57zr8i,"Twitter DD, or ""why Twitter is a flaming ball of trash and nobody sane will buy them""","Recently there was a lot of furor surrounding Twitter, which has been attempting to sell itself for quite some time. The most recent bidding round / attempt was earlier this month and did not end well. I have been short the company since the IPO roughly 3 years ago, and have had very bearish expectations on its growth / ability to reach profitability since then as well. 

DD link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-2lfk5k3-1zNEV1LWd0SXdyVkk

Salesforce was the bidder that stayed in the process the longest, and the one that probably was the most serious about purchasing Twitter, compared to the other guys who basically did it on a whim (Disney lol). Ever since they lost LinkedIn to Microsoft they have been like a crack addict looking for a high in the form of M&amp;A, and really are willing to buy just about anything, except for Twitter apparently. 

I used pretty generous assumptions for the model, assuming that Twitter's costs would stay roughly constant and its revenue would grow at a clip of 12%, which is close to street consensus. I used street consensus numbers for Salesforce as well. I don't think at this time Twitter is capable of cutting R&amp;D, G&amp;A, and other expenses to below roughly 70% of revenue within a 2 year period - it sits at a little over 80% right now and Twitter seems to be focused on its user retention issues more than anything else, which I am not sure is actually addressing the problems the company has with making money effectively. I also projected 10% cost synergies given that there is a reasonable overlap of workforce with lots of excess fat to cut, and servers can be cross-used between the two services. Used basically all the cash &amp; equivalents on both sheets except for a very small portion ($400mn pro forma). Using this or leaving it doesn't significantly change the resultant dilution.

Speaking of dilution, the deal is *highly* dilutive - something like 25% in 2016 and 20% in 2017. This isn't because Salesforce is actually diluting their equity that much, but it's just because Twitter's losing money so fast that any potential synergies can't really make up for its failure as a company. In theory, the deal could be accretive in 2017 if Twitter cut costs considerably (for instance, try changing F71 - F73 in the Twitter tab to 25%, 35%, and 10% from 30%, 40% and 12%), but I don't think this scenario is likely as the company hasn't been able to do this in the past and shows no initiative to cut costs in the present.

More generally, in tech M&amp;A you are acquiring one of two things: intellectual property (software rights, patents and the like), or data on individuals which you can use to cross-sell. It's unclear if Twitter has either one of these, as the data its collecting is not particularly relevant nor useful for an enterprise software company. I have faith that in the long-term the company will continue to crumble under the weight of its bad business model. 

Also, I don't think earnings later this month will be pretty given the first half of the year but definitely could be wrong on this one as I don't play the earnings that much. ",28

16-10-18,581gqk,Is CANN a Pump and Dump?,"It was recently suggest in response to my criticism of this thread that I should contribute more meaningful responses.  I have taken the time to write the following to show how I personally would approach analyzing this stock.

As a preliminary matter, I see many people on here looking at Balance Sheets.  However, my understanding is that wall street analysts prefer the Statement of Cash Flows because, unlike the accounting tricks that can be played with other financial statements, the Statement of Cash Flows is less susceptible to accounting manipulations.  I personally prefer the Income Statement.  The Balance Sheet is not preferred because it is literally a snapshot of one-second in time and too susceptible to manipulation.  For example, I have personally went to the bank, obtained proof of fund letters so I can submit an offer, and then an hour later returned to the bank and withdrawn significance portions of those funds, so when I submitted my offer, the requisite funds were no longer available (because I knew I would have the funds at closing).  That's an example at how flawed balance sheets are, and trust me, the number of such tricks are virtually endless (*Financial Statement Fraud: Strategies for Detection and Investigation* by Gerard M. Zack is an excellent resource if you want to learn how this is done, but I digress).  So let's checkout [CANN's most recent Annual Report](http://www.secinfo.com/d1awwf.wHe.htm#1stPage) that it filed with the SEC.

So what is CANN?  Fun Fact: This company's predecessor began as ""an independent geographic information system ('GIS') and custom draft energy mapping company providing hard copy and digital format oil and gas production maps for the oil and gas industry in the United States and Canada.""  As of December 31, 2015, CANN had 13 full-time salaried employees and approximately 80 hourly employees and, significantly, CANN also owned 5 subsidiaries.

CANN's Iron Protection Group (IPG) ""provides advanced security, including on-site professionals, video surveillance and cash transport, to licensed cannabis cultivators and retail shops"" and consists of approximately 80 guards who serve 14 clients throughout Colorado. 

CANN's Chiefton Supply Co. ""is an apparel and design company"" that ""design[s], distribute[s] and sell[s] apparel featuring graphic designs.""

CANN's GC Supply ""is a reseller of supplies to the cannabis market"" and operates out of a leased, 1,800 square-foot warehouse.

CANN's Next Big Crop provides ""comprehensive consulting services to the cannabis industry that include obtaining licenses, compliance, cultivation, logistical support, facility design and building services.""

CANN's real estate leasing business ""primarily includes the acquisition and leasing of cultivation space and related facilities to licensed marijuana growers and dispensary owners for their operations.""  As of December 31, 2015, CANN's real estate leasing business ""owned one cultivation property"" approximately three acres in size that includes a 5,000 square foot steel building and a parking lot.

CANN's The Greenhouse owns a former retail bank building that measures 16,056 square-foot ""which will be converted to serve as the largest shared workspace for entrepreneurs, professionals and others serving the cannabis industry.""

CANN also ""lease[s] cultivation equipment and facilities to customers in the cannabis industry.""  It ""expect[s] [to] ... enter into sale lease-back transactions of grow lights, tenant improvements and other grow equipment.""  However,  Colorado State law does not allow entities operating under a cannabis license to pledge the assets or the license of the cannabis operation for any type of general borrowing activity, so CANN ""intend[s] to provide loans to individuals and businesses in the cannabis industry on an **unsecured** basis.""  

So that's CANN's business.  It looks as though it attempts to be the pancea of all things marijuana, so over diversification is my first concern.

As a threshold matter, if you are looking for dividends, you can move on.  From page 10 of CANN's most recent Annual Statement: ""No cash dividends have ever been declared and it is not anticipated that cash dividends will ever be paid. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance future growth. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors the Board considers relevant.""  This is not necessarily a red flag for new firms that are plowing earnings back into the company to finance growth; however, this is **not** what CANN is doing.

So how does CANN make money?  Looking at its Consolidated Statements of Operations (i.e., Income Statement) on page 22, during FY2015 CANN earned $1,762,978 in revenues.  That sounds good until I read under the title ""Revenue"" on page 13: ""**Revenue increased primarily due the acquisition of Iron Protection Group ('IPG') in March 2015, which generated $1,490,832 of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015.**""  So, almost 85% of CANN's revenue came from CANN's Iron Protection Group, which as noted above ""provides advanced security, including on-site professionals, video surveillance and cash transport, to licensed cannabis cultivators and retail shops.""  So this makes CANN more of a security company (think Brinks or Wells Fargo) than a marijuana company.  Only about 15%, or $272,146, of CANN's revenues came from its other four subsidiaries.  Now this is not a bad thing per se.  Just realize that you are buying mostly a security company and not a marijuana cultivator.

With regards to your question, a negative cash flow is not necessarily a bad thing.  Many startups have negative cash flow because they are taking on large amounts of spontaneous short-term liabilities as well as long-term debt loads to finance expanding operations, which is precisely what growth investors want to see.  *However, that is not the case with CANN.*  For example, during FY2015, CANN earned $1,762,978 in revenues, but note the breakdown: $1,604,632 came from its security services (IPG), $100,782 from tenant rent, and a whopping $57,564 came from product sales.  So CANN is first a security/consulting services company, second a landlord, and third a marijuana apparel and equipment reseller. 

These revenues were offset by a whopping $9,006,389 in FY2015 cost and expenses.  Of these cost and expenses, $282,828 was for the non-cash expense of depreciation and amortization (which we will ignore because we are concerned with actual cash flows and not mere accounting conventions such as non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses), making FY2015 cost and expenses total $8,723,561.  The breakdown of these expenses are as follows:

Cost of service revenues	$1,307,821

Cost of goods sold	 	115,208

SG&amp;A	 		 	1,433,359

Share-based compensation 	5,418,672

Professional fees	 	 	448,501

According to CANN's Annual Statement, most of the $1,307,821 cost of service revenues was incurred ""primarily due to the IPG acquisition, which had costs of $1,276,516 ....""  So ignoring this atypical one-time expense, CANN's FY2015 cost of service revenues was $31,305.  Unfortunately, we cannot compare CANN's $31,305 cost of service revenues for FY2015 with its cost of service revenues from FY2014 because the latter figure is unavailable.  So we continue on to the next expense item.

Cost of goods sold looks reasonable, but **SG&amp;A and share-based compensation (e.g., stock options, warrants, etc) are red flags.**  SG&amp;A can include certain salaries, and from the looks of share-based compensation, that's what appears to be going on.  The question we have to answer is what exactly is the breakdown for the SG&amp;A?  Is CANN keeping the firm indebted by doling out large salaries to its D&amp;Os and managers (as seemingly confirmed by its $5,418,672 in share-based compensation)?  Who are the ""professionals"" who earned $448,501?  Friends?  Relatives?  Those are considerable accounting and legal fees for such a small firm (albeit not impossible considering CANN's acquisition of IPG and the accompanying accountant valuation and legal bills).  Also, why is CANN's overhead approximately 4 times its gross margin?  *No firm can survive the long-term by earning only 1/4 of its overhead.*

Per page 13 of CANN's Annual Statement: ""Selling, general and administrative expense increased in 2015 compared to 2014, due to an increase in administrative salaries in connection with the IPG acquisition and our hiring of individuals from Next Big Crop for our consulting segment, as well as overhead incurred on The Greenhouse.""  Fine.  Fair enough.  It's beginning to look as though FY2015 may not be the best year to analyze due to CANN's atypical one-time expenses (and revenues) associated with its acquisition of IPG, so let's try to analyze FY2014.

During FY2014, before CANN's acquisition of the IPG security firm, CANN earned a whopping $240,206 (that's **$1,522,772 less** than CANN's FY2015 total revenues of $1,762,978 after acquiring IPG).  The breakdown of CANN's FY2014 revenues are $40,000 in service revenue, $115,059 in tenant rent, and $85,147 in product sales.  So prior to acquiring IPG, CANN was first a landlord, second a marijuana apparel and equipment reseller, and third a consulting services company.  Despite having no acquisitions during FY2014 and earning only $240,206 in total revenues, this same year (FY2014) CANN incurred $2,775,945 in total costs and expenses, **over 11.5 times its total revenues**, which is similar to the trend we observed in FY2015.  But why?

Not coincidentally, we see the same trend in FY2014: SG&amp;A is $787,325 or *328% of total revenues*, share-based compensation (stock options, warrants, etc) is $1,298,375 or *541% of total revenues*, and professional fees is $555,442 or *231% of total revenues*.  See the trend?  It appears to me that revenues generated by CANN are almost immediately diverted off into salaries and other stock options, warrants, etc for its D&amp;Os and managers.  I see $0 going into R&amp;D or other efforts to expand CANN's market share, which is what one would expect to see from a new firm.  Rather, I see key personnel lining their pockets instead of plowing earnings back into this nascent firm.  This is consistent with the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan adopted by CANN (see pages 10 and 39), which offers ""an additional incentive to executives, employees, directors and key consultants ....""  ""The Incentive Plan provides that up to 10 million shares of our common stock may be issued under the Plan,"" and pursuant to this plan, there are 2,761,500 shares that will be issued if these executives, employees, directors and key consultants exercise outstanding options, warrants and rights.  Even more concerning, there is an additional 7,238,500 shares that are available for future issuance under equity compensation plans.  If exercised, these outstanding options, warrants and rights work to water down earnings and other per-share based metrics (e.g., EPS, etc).  In sum, on page 24 CANN's Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit) shows a total of 14,915,421 shares outstanding. 

Also, note how overly-diversified CANN is - security services, consulting services, real estate leases, equipment leasing, all the way down to apparel lines.  A jack-of-all trades but master of none has no core competency that gives it a strategic advantage.  It just keeps buying up investments for the cash flows that others have created.  This is why *over 85% of its FY2015 total revenues came from CANNs acquisition of IPG*.  Acquisitions are not organic growth, which is what investors want to see.  Stated alternatively, IPG is increasing its revenues by buying other companies and their cash flows, not by organic growth and expanding its market share.  In fact, product sales *decreased* $27,583, about 1/3, from 2014 and 2015, and tenant rents decreased $14,277, or 12%, during this same period, so CANN appears to be *losing* in the organic growth / market share expansion department. 

Not wanting to jump to a hasty conclusion, I would ordinarily check CANN's FY2013 Annual Statement filed with the SEC to confirm this pattern, but unfortunately, CANN's FY2013 Annual Statement is not available on the SEC website, which is a cold reminder that we're dealing with a company without any real performance track record.

I've seen enough of the Income Statement.  It's a no-go for me at this moment.  Let's look at the Statement of Cash Flows and see if my analysis is wrong.  The Statement of Cash Flows - which sets forth the cash flowing in/out of CANN categorized by operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities - immediately reveals that CANN's operating and investing activities have been in the red for both FY2015 and FY2014.  It also reveals that CANN stays afloat through its financing activities (i.e., issuing debt and equity, warrants, options, etc), which is generally not a good thing.  For example, during FY2014, CANN took on $1,100,000 as an ""[i]ncrease in line of credit - related party,"" which means that an insider is loaning money to the firm, quite possibly money he or she previously took out of the firm.  I have worked on forensic accounting matters, and this blurring of the separate entity doctrine is ubiquitous when fraud occurs, although fraud is not always when it exists.  I'm definitely not interested now, but let's look at the Balance Sheet to again confirm whether I am wrong.

The Balance Sheet tells us that CANN's cash and cash equivalents dropped $106,825 or 65%, between year end 2014 to year end 2015.  It also tells us that CANN's inventory decreased by $54,823, or 78%, while it accounts receivable increased by $106,234, or 580%, during this same period.  This is not a good sign as the firm is less liquid, and although it suggests that CANN is selling inventory (hence the reduction in inventory), these sales appear to be credit based sales and not cash (hence the increase in accounts receivable).  Other red flags are its claimed $1,524,927 in net intangible assets and an additional $187,000 in goodwill, both of which are subject to  manipulation due to subjective valuations.  Thus, 41% of CANN's assets are ""net intangible assets,"" which its Annual Statement  describes as ""primarily of customer relationships, non-compete agreements with key employees, and marketing-related intangibles.""  The Annual Statement breaks these ""assets"" down as follows:

Customer relationship intangible	$1,000,000 ($923,288 net)

Marketing-related intangibles	$200,000 ($169,315 net)

Non-compete agreements		$500,000 ($372,14 net)

Chiefton brand and designs		$69,400 ($60,178 net)

Goodwill					$187,000

I don't even know what ""Customer relationship intangible"" or ""Marketing-related intangibles"" even means, and the definition of these terms is conspicuously absent from CANN's Annual Statement.  While I might overlook $200,000 for Marketing-related intangibles, I cannot overlook $1,000,000 for Customer relationship intangibles, not in a company this small.  I work in the legal profession and can tell you that Non-compete agreements are often unenforceable as a matter of law and are frequently unenforceable in practice, so how CAAN values Non-compete agreements at $500,000 is beyond me.  But wait.  It gets better.  In an attempt to see if the Chiefton brand and design could possibly be valued at $69,400, we head on over to the United States Patent and Trademark Office's [Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS)](https://www.uspto.gov/trademark), which reveals [only a single word mark that contains the word Chiefton](http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4807:jm6pav.7.1) and that is **the street** name of the owner of a registered word mark pertaining to autism, and CANN has no business interest whatsoever in autism.  So either CANN owns no Chiefton brand and designs or else it does and they are not registered, which further draws into question how CANN could value an UNregistered brand at $69,400.  **MAJOR RED FLAG!**

But wait.  There's more.  From year-end 2014 to year-end 2015, CANN's accounts payable and accrued expenses increased from $83,185 to $293,532, which is **353%**.  This is what is known as ""spontaneous liabilities,"" which allow a company to take on debt in the course of it operations or ""spontaneously"".  **It is a sign that CANN is either not paying its bills or that it is taking on loads of debt**.  This is even more concerning when the 65% decrease in CANN's cash and cash equivalents and the 580% increase in CANN's accounts receivable it considered.

CANN's capital structure is even more concerning.  During FY 2015, the firm was already paying interest to the tune of $84,720 and had accumulated a total of $3,470,292 in outstanding debt: 

Line of credit – related party					$800,000

Notes payable (current portion, net of discount)		$986,475

Accrued stock payable, current portion				$1,532,420

Notes payable (less current portion, net of discount) 	$151,397

So let's see if CANN has sufficient liquidity to pay its liabilities.

Current ratio (Current assets / Current liabilities) = 245,516 / 3,730,293 = 0.065816814

Quick ratio ((Cash + Marketable securities + Acccts receivable) / Current liabilities) = (58,711 + 124,553) / 3,730,293 = 0.049128581

While these figures vary from industry to inddustry, according to *Business Ratios and Formulas: A Comprehensive Guide, 2d ed* by Steven M. Bragg, ""**[a] current ratio of 1:1 is considered to be the absolute minimum level of acceptable liquidity, whereas a ratio
closer to 2:1 is preferred.""""""

I've seen enough.  This is a small business that the owners dip into via stock, options, and warrant, transactions and infuse cash into when need be.  In my opinion, this is not a company the generates revenues or has any long-term strategy or identifiable core competency other than doing anything to make a buck.

The point I want to make is that this is a SIMPLIFIED version of what goes into analyzing a stock.  I could have got into analyzing the various promissory notes and other debt instruments to ensure my analysis is correct, but I know enough at this point without getting that involved.  Other's analyses might require more in-depth treatment.  If I was *truly* interested in purchasing CANN, I would read ALL of its SEC filings to better understand the stock options, warrants, etc to determine whether or not my analysis is correct (and it may not be).  I hope some of you found this at lease somewhat useful.

&gt; **Goldman Sachs** — Goldman Sachs on Tuesday reported third-quarter earnings that easily beat on both the top and bottom line, helped by strong gains in trading revenue. Shares spiked more than 1.5 percent in premarket trade. The investment bank posted quarterly earnings of $4.88 a share on revenue of $8.17 billion, up from $6.86 billion in revenue in the same quarter last year. Bottom-line profit surged 58 percent. Analysts had expected Goldman Sachs to report third-quarter earnings per share of $3.82 on revenue of $7.42 billion, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters.

16-10-18,583mm7,Reddit Open Yale Course | Week 7 and Midterm 1 | Efficient Markets,"Hi everyone!

First of all, apologies for the delay. My own career in finance is about to start, meaning I am spending not an awful lot of time on Reddit the last weeks.

I decided to pool week 7 and Midterm 1 together.

###Introduction 
This week revolves around efficient markets or, more broadly, the *Efficient Market Hypothesis*. The EMH is one of the, if not the most, widely contested theories in finance. Although most academia agree that the EMH at least holds to some extent, opinions varies on to *which* extent. After this lecture, you should be able to at least grasp the theory and formulate your own opinion on it. 

###Study Materials (week 7)
* [Watch](http://oyc.yale.edu/economics/econ-252-11/lecture-7) | [Transcript](http://oyc.yale.edu/transcript/1074/econ-252-11) | [YouTube Week 7: Efficient Markets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EzdvkRgToY)
* Read | Chapter 2 | Shiller, *Finance and the Good Society*
* Read | Lehrer, ['The Truth Wears Off: Is There Something Wrong with the Scientific Method?'](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/12/13/101213fa_fact_lehrer) The New Yorker*

I have an SIP retirement plan through my company where I can invest in my company's employee stock fund (98% of which is company stock I think). 

Am I right to assume that if I allocate more of my retirement fund towards my company's stock fund I'll acquire more shares of the company at this lower price up until the buyout goes through where the shares will be bought at the agreed upon amount, i.e. I'll make a sizeable return on that investment? 

I'm confident that if I bought stock it would work this way, I'm just unsure how an ""employee stock fund"" works in the context of an SIP. Not sure if this is the right place to ask this question. ",14

16-10-19,587mir,Need help picking 401k investment options / general 401k advice (x-post from /r/personalfinance),"(x-post from /r/personalfinance)

Hi /r/investing,  

I'm a recent college grad w/ very little experience in personal finance and investment. With that said, I'm not really sure how to best choose investments for my company's 401k plan administered by American Funds. While I read the sidebar links for retirement and the fund selection guide, I'm still just as confused as when I started research.  
  
I was hoping that with a reference of the fund name, ticker symbol, and expense ratios of the different options available in my plan, the experts of /r/investing could help out. Here is a [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_UoNBRPr5dC5VxidVCkgUumz2ZxvpKMhtqO7PjqsCgA/) to a spreadsheet I made with the relevant option details available in my plan.  
  
Other relevant info that may be useful: 22 year old male, 85k annual gross income. My company's 401k match is a 100% match up to 3% of our contribution, and a 50% match between 3% and 5% of our contribution. My understanding is that a contribution of 5% means a 100% match for 4% from my company (please correct me if wrong).  
  
I also wanted to ask some general 401k questions:  
  
* 1) Considering my financial situation, is it wise to max it out or only contribute my match? For example, I would contribute $750 as a dollar amount to my 401k every pay period to reach the $18,000 yearly limit vs. only contributing 5% of each paycheck.
* 2) Considering my financial situation, should I consider the standard or Roth option?  
  
**TL;DR** 22 year old recent college grad w/ income of 85k. need advice on how to choose investments from a list of options for a 401k plan. options found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_UoNBRPr5dC5VxidVCkgUumz2ZxvpKMhtqO7PjqsCgA/",43

**Company**: FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation

**Ticker**: FUJIY

**Why I like them**: I'm a bit of a camera nut and have been following the digital camera scene for quite some time. Bottom line they've been killing it with their X-series cameras and X-series lenses since being released in 2012. The entire lineup has been getting stellar reviews and it's the first digital camera maker that excels at producing great looking JPEG files right out of the camera. To me this is the first truly mature camera line that fully replaces film. Earlier this year Fuji has announced their medium format camera which means it can play in the serious professional market and puts them on a path to enter the full frame market as well.

I see lots of potential for Fuji because they really listen to consumer feedback and have shown lots of focus in both hardware and software improvements. They also have tons of sensor patents that are flat out the best available and stem from their history working in imaging. Likewise, they have lots of experience in optics and their lenses are considered to be some of the best right now.

Their marketing is brilliant as well and doing a great job at messaging to their target market.

I'm investing in Fuji long term because they are doing things the right way and while it's true that the overall digital camera market is declining, Fuji is a relatively small player and still has lots of room to grow. [Here are their projections through 2017](http://m43.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-13-at-11.15.58-PM.png).

I'll briefly address why neither matter before telling you why you should dump your life savings into Tesla: SCTY adds little *product* value and nobody cares about the Bolt.

Now, lets jump into it: You jabronis think TSLA is all about the cars or the acquisitions it makes. While they are both contributing factors, Tesla is really a *technology* company, with it's largest asset being *data*. This is how the valuation is derived. The second Tesla begins licensing its tech, TSLA stock will skyrocket. For those who think more long term, Tesla could integrate native advertising within its platform. Being that TSLA is currently sitting at $197ish, there is plenty of room to make huge gains.

I was absolutely stunned to see that the average return of stocks over time is 7% annually. Even if it is 6% if calculated with a geometric mean, this blows my mind. (If inflation is higher, it appears that it even matches that. So perhaps a better way to say is that the average return beats inflation by about 3%.) I used to think that stocks on average return 0% (like up 10 then down 8 or so). I thought that matching inflation was already a good thing, and I cannot stress how much mind blown I was by this. I could not concentrate on my homework hours later. 

Are these numbers true? What about annual return rates for other investments like bonds and the like? I seriously did not know that these ""risky"" investments (not bonds but stocks and stuff) return 7% over the long run. ",18

I could convert and transfer my Canadian money to the states for my already existing accounts but with the loss in bad conversion rates and shitty fees transferring money it would be a decent chunk of money. 

So I was wondering about more direct methods of investing. There are no Robinhood or wealth front equivalents in Canada. 
There is a Canadian branch of vanguard that invests in the Canadian markets. It seems like my only viable option.

16-10-18,585dxi,Can we talk about XBI/IBB movement into 2017?,"Hi all,

I'm pretty much full-time biotech analyst, but my background is science, not financials or economics.

Here's what we know:
Hillary is likely to win the nomination.
Hillary and the democratic party are attacking drug pricing for the past 2 years now.
We know Hillary receives significant campaign contributions from pharmaceuticals (including Mylan).
We also know that a rate hike by December is possible.

All of this says November is going to be a bleak month for XBI/IBB and the single tickers in the sector.

So how do we look at this?

1) We have the ""damning"" emails coming out the first week of November from wikileaks that are supposed to make hillary ""done"". Who knows.
2) We know that a house majority for the democrats is highly unlikely, and thus actual reform into drug pricing is also unlikely.
3) Rate hikes are beginning to be priced in - SPY has not hit 220/ ES has not hit 2200, etc - whereas if the rate hike was unlikely, I think we would have.

My perspective is, any downward movement from here is going to be re-traced by February, if not January. Thus, I'm considering going cash (or even into LABD) the following weeks, staying cash into the first week of november, and rebuying after the election.

Do any of you have plans?",4

For all you haters who want more insight...

First off, I'm long AMD and have been for a while now. This graph won't be changing my position in the long-run. This triangle formation is suggestive of a pop in the price in either direction and coincidentally the tip of the triangle lands on earnings, meaning the price movement can be large...

Though analysts seem bullish about this stock and upcoming earnings, there still seems to be very high short interest.

Anyhow, playing earnings is always risky. I plan to hold my current shares and buy more if AMD closes above the apex of the triangle come earnings - historically, large moves up have been followed by subsequent green days.

So like I said, I'd get out of the market. Like now. I'll explain why. And don't worry, I'll even tell you when to get back in. 

I've posted about this before, but it was in comments and they never gained a lot of traction. This being WSB, I'm sure most of you haven't read [this](http://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/2016/02/uetrend/) post on the philosophical economics blog. You don't have to, because I'm gonna explain it right now. 

(Here's my independent [excel](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cfh84iYIBGGT_GSLVLrdYdLLfjV21o59cOHvnF5eb3s/edit?usp=sharing) file. Its messy af but deal with it)

Basically, the guy found that when the 12 month moving average of the civilian unemployment rate crosses the real civilian unemployment rate, there's a good chance of recession. Notably, this indicator has a LOT OF FALSE POSITIVES. Lots of false calls for recession. 

That makes it a shitty indicator, right? Wrong. Because every time there HAS been a recession, it's called it. We just have to figure out how to rule out the false positives. 

SO what this guy on philosophical economics did was add some S&amp;P 500 moving average indicator and combine it with the unemployment rate indicator. And, no shit, it beat the market. 

But I fucking tested it in excel. Which wasn't easy. And yeah you woulda beaten the market over the long run. BUT, BUT BUT **BUT**, the returns were almost **ALL** from the last 2 *recessions/market crashes*. 

This is key. Recession DOES NOT EQUAL market crash. Only the last 2 recessions have also had a market crash in near perfect tandem. 

Oh. I forgot to mention. The indicator crossed last month. And for what it's worth, the bullshit S&amp;P MA indicator the blogger made has already crossed too. 

So like I said, since it's crossed, we just have to figure out if it's a false positive or not. Well, here, let me ask you, stop for a second.

What do you fucking think. 

Do you think the economy is gonna be fine? Like. Don't even use indicators or anything. Do things look good right now? No. Everything's fucked. 

So even if you're a LITTLE nervous right now, and almost all the smart money is getting at least a little nervous, this should be the symbol flashing at you to get the fuck out.

Oh yeah, and the 10 month S&amp;P 500 moving average actually does something. It tells you roughly when the market bottom is. Every time. You're welcome. 

To conclude. All in on JNUG.

[Edit]: there appears to be some confusion here. This was a joke

EDIT: If I had to reccomend a course of action I would wait to sell and short until there is a legitimate downturn. You'll still sit out most of the losses and you would have ridden the rest of the way up pre crash",70

# Description
Blackstone is a global alternative asset manager. The Company's alternative asset management businesses include investment vehicles focused on private equity, real estate, hedge fund solutions, non-investment grade credit, secondary funds and other multi-asset class strategies. 

Though it's key to remember that an investment in Blackstone is an investment in ""common units representing limited partner interests"" and overall BX has got a rather [complicated structure](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1393818/000119312516481948/g129194g33d21.jpg).

## Recent financials 

Private equity businesses have **lumpy** revenues to say the least! They have annual management fees like a traditional asset manager based on a % of assets but the real deal in the performance fee.

So what I'm really happy to see is assets continuing to grow and the dividend ticking up.

|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Assets under management | $336bn | $290bn | $266bn | $210bn | $166bn|
|Revenue | $4.6bn | $7.5bn | $6.6bn | $4.0bn | $3.3bn|
|EPS | $1.04 | $2.58 | $1.98 | $0.41 | -$0.35|
|DPS | $2.90 | $1.92 | $1.18 | $0.52 | $0.62|

## Competition

Competition comes in many guises. From other asset managers for private equity expertise and from asset managers in other asset classes. 

Have to admit, I am at a loss on how to compare these folks operationally, so here's their revenue and returns. Suggestions?

|Companies|Latest Sales|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|
Blackstone Group LP | $3,034M |  5%
KKR &amp; Co. L.P. | $1,236M |  -ve
Oaktree Capital Group LLC | $637M | 13%
The Carlyle Group LP | $2,104M |  -ve
Apollo Global Management LLC | $1,168M |  25%
Fortress Investment Group LLC | $1,143M |  3%
BlackRock, Inc. | $11,128M | N/A
Franklin Resources, Inc. | $6,880M  | 13%
T. Rowe Price Group Inc | $4,140M  | 21%

Similarly it seems a little odd to think about the balance sheet and debt levels.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $31.46 for Blackstone Group LP and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 33% to their target.

Which if achievable seems like a juicy return, for backing some of the smartest folks on Wall Street.

# Valuation

On earnings it's as cheap as a *boring* traditional asset manager like BEN. Though given the volatility of earnings, let's look at the yield... 7%. Nice. 

Though again given the volatility of earnings, there's not reason to believe it can't get cut in tough times. For example the forecast for this year is a fraction of last years $2.90 payout.

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/bx/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|
BX | $28,158M | 12x | 26% | 7% |
KKR | $11,024M | 22x | 21% | 5% |
OAK | $6,228M | 16x | 33% | 6% | 
CG.O | $4,724M | 12x | 23% | 12% | 
APO | $3,253M | 10x | 29% | 7% |
FIG | $1,980M | 7x | 26% | 13% | 
BLK | $58,009M | 19x | 11% | 3% | 
BEN | $19,721M | 12x | -5% | 2% | 
TROW.O | $16,208M | 15x | 8% | 3% | 

# Dividends

Blackstone Group LP is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.61 per share, compares to a forecast EPS of $1.90.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -9% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -8%. 

Now the backdrop is ugly, but again this is the nature of the industry. Revenues were down 40% and EPS down 50% in the last 6 months. Ooof. 

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, they pointed to continued growth in asset but a challenging global environment. Fortunately 75% of the business is US based. The CEO also decided to come up with a weird formula to value BX!

&gt; For our unitholders, if you simply ignore realizations and focus solely on our fee-related earnings, we have a clear line of sight towards strong double-digit growth in fee earnings for next year. This alone could generate approximately $1 per unit or more depending upon the timing of certain events, particularly funds being launched. You should know, which I actually didn't, that the S&amp;P is yielding around 2% today. It's incredibly low. And we don't see why our mostly locked up fee earnings shouldn't be capitalized in our stock price at a similar, if not, lower yield to the S&amp;P. You could do the math. A 2% yield, the same as the S&amp;P on $1 off fee-related earnings implies a $50 stock price, not to $26 where we are today. I know this seems hard to believe but it happens to be mathematically true and finance is supposed to have something to do with mathematics.

I chuckled when I see Steve Schwarzman say he doesn't know the dividend yield of the S&amp;P! Though I absolute hate when management talks about their share price.

My prejudice aside, it's hard not to admire the growth in assets, the machiavellian style of these ex-bankers, and the cash potential of BX. Just think, the stock's price is $24 and in the last 9 years they've paid a total of $11 in dividends. And they do buybacks too.

So even if the way they make money is a ""black box"", and it's crazy volatile...may be just may be...

## Recent financials 

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $39bn | $40bn | $39bn | $38bn | $37bn|
|EPS | $6.04 | $5.33 | $4.92 | $3.69 | $2.61|

It's a pretty remarkable increase in earnings. How? Look at what's happened to gross margin. In the last 3 years it's gone from 27% to 28% to 31%. Wow.

Here's their explanation

&gt; Our balanced long-term focus on enhancing shareowner value resulted in segment margin expansion, maintaining R&amp;D spending, new product introductions and new initiatives intensified throughout the company, driving productivity.

Thumbs up, eh?

## The divisions

When you did into the different units, sure Aerospace is the biggest, but it still only 40% of overall profit. So, it's a true conglomerate. And frankly, I'm really not sure what the synergies are. 

|Aerospace|2015A|2014A|2013A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $15bn | $16bn | $16bn |
|Operating Profit | $3.2bn | $2.9bn | $2.9bn |

|Automation|2015A|2014A|2013A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $14bn | $14bn | $13bn |
|Operating Profit | $2.3bn | $2.2bn | $2.0bn |

|Materials|2015A|2014A|2013A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $9bn | $10bn | $10bn |
|Operating Profit | $1.9bn | $1.8bn | $1.7bn |

## Competition

Looking at the competition it's the usual suspects in the 3 different business lines!

We are subject to competition in substantially all product and service areas. Some of our key competitors are:
 	
* Aerospace: Borg-Warner (automotive), Garmin, General Electric, Rockwell Collins, Thales and United Technologies
* ACS: 3M, Johnson Controls, Schneider, Siemens and Zebra-Motorola
* PMT: Albemarle, BASF, Dow, Dupont, Emerson and Sinopec

It's margins aren't best in class, but they aren't far off and when it comes to returns on equity they are damned fine.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Honeywell International Inc. | $39,106M | 22% | 26%
Garmin Ltd. | $2,897M | 23% | 16%
Rockwell Collins, Inc. | $5,198M | 24% | 34%
United Technologies Corporation | $56,319M | 16% | 13%
3M Co | $30,081M | 29% | 39%
Johnson Controls International PLC | $9,661M | 17% | 12%
Siemens AG (ADR) | $86,897M | 12% | 15%
Albemarle Corporation | $3,162M | 28% | 17%
Dow Chemical Co | $46,153M | 18% | 36%
E I Du Pont De Nemours And Co | $24,793M | 18% | 18%
Emerson Electric Co. | $20,581M | 18% | 22%

## Cash / Debt?

$HON has $7,041M of net debt. That is 0.8x it's latest operating profit. So little to worry about there.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $123.95 for $HON and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 15% to their target.

# Valuation

It's pretty easy to see the logic. Earnings are on a nice trajectory, even if they wobbled earlier this month, and it isn't aggressive at 16x. The best in class competitors are able to justify nearly a 20x valuation.

# Dividends

Honeywell International Inc. is forecast to pay a dividend of $2.39 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $2.31 per share. That is a 3% growth. The forecast dividend of $2.39 compares to a forecast EPS of $6.61. On top of the regular dividend they are happily buying back stock as well.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -9% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -1%. That's against a backdrop of sales up 3% in the first 6 months.

Though the real deal is that earlier this month they trimmed [guidence](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/07/honeywell-lowers-upper-end-of-2016-profit-forecast.html) for the year. Took the wind outta the sails.

Apart from that other catalysts to think about a new CEO coming in March and the cutting of the ACS division into two.

So, the recent wobble aside... will you give management the benefit of the doubt?

PM didn't dip on earnings, but they're in a position for a few percent jump.

GWW did dip on earnings. They lowered guidance. The company has alright financials (bit too much debt but not enough to be a killer). Might go down further for a few more days but we should get a few percent gains on this over the course of the next 3 weeks (really small play, but gains or gains).

IBKR didn't really do much after earnings was released. If this dips then I'll likely pick some up.

MANH dropped about 8% after earnings were released in the am. Only thing I saw was a EPS miss, but I didn't dig into it that much. This one I'm on the fence about and will be watching tomorrow and doing more research on it. Their financials are making me really tempted to buy the dip (maybe on Friday).

INTC dropped over 4.5% (ah and pm) after they released their earnings because they lowered Q4 guidance. Their financials are  alright. This one will probably take 2 or 3 days before it reaches the bottom.

If I buy anything I'll post screenshots and an accompanying post so you guys don't start bashing me because you think I'm Australian and apparently think I'm just pulling your chops with another trash post.

My understanding is that while TLT has a lower expense ratio (0.15% vs VUSTX's 0.2%), VUSTX is less-volatile as it isn't traded in real time and prevents one from selling off and then buying back in within 90 days. Also, TLT is traded on the open market like a stock, while VUSTX is not.  
  
  
Aside from the increased volatility of TLT, why would I *not* invest in it over VUSTX if I'm looking for long-term exposure to U.S. Treasury Bonds? Am I missing something?",6
16-10-19,58cesz,[Showerthought] (Actual) autism is a benefit in trading.,"Initial disclaimer: I am a very high functioning autistic, so the stereotypical drooling, socially defunct restard doesn't really apply. However, I am very socially awkward, and despite what my equally defunct gf tells me, emotionally inhibited - at least that's how I feel.

However, this is a boon when it comes to trading. Gambling and trading are exciting to me, it's exhilarating when you win, and gutting when you lose, but despite the emotional investment, due to my autistic tendencies, emotion and behavior are detached. I found myself ruined in the downturn of oil, heavily invested in uwti at the time, but I didn't sell off , recouping most of my losses recently.

I still believe oil is doomed to fall further need on the fact that opec is a pack of lying exploitationists, but didn't panic sell at the bottom. I was able to disassociate the emotional response from the impulse controls, and waited for a more beneficial exit point. I recently had a similar encounter with jnug that I held through the recent dip, and closed the position in the green.

I am still bag holding a few lousy trades (ahs, being the primary portfolio drag), but I am convinced they'll come around eventually around earnings. But despite only having been trading for a few weeks, autism has given me a great start on learning the discipline and patience that more advanced traders rely on to mitigate losses. I still have a lot to learn, but my disconnect between behavioral reactions and emotional impulse has protected me from around a 30% loss and mitigated it to approximately a 4% loss, which in a month may even become a gain.

TLDR: autism gives newbies a head start on not falling into the trap of panic selling low, prematurely.",3

I make use of the BATS network to buy stocks. My broker makes use of the Interactive Brokers trading platform, I think they rent their service and then sell it to Dutch client like me. I am not sure if I understand the ECN concept correctly. Basically, certain companies trade at certain stock exchanges (only Euronext, only Nasdaq, only BATS). BATS recently dethroned Nasdaq from 2nd spot. 

I wonder, couldn't companies like NYSE block BATS' trading platform or charge higher prices if people bought through BATS, creating unfair competition? How does it work? I make use of Interactive Brokers, which makes use of the BATS ECN, which gets data from Nasdaq/NYSE with a mini delay? For the most accurate prices, I would have to subscribe to a Nasdaq/NYSE service? But which broker provides that? And even then, if I subscribe to NYSE, I will still have delay for Nasdaq stock prices?

Kind regards",1
16-10-19,58cow5,$AXDX - My long play.,"$AXDX is my hidden little gem.  I bought it back when it was ~13 a share and sold a good portion to make around 11k.   I am now deeper into it.  For those not in the know, AXDX has a device purported to accurately and rapidly diagnose what the cause of certain infections are.   The ""big deal"" is this can reduce the amount of over-prescription of antibiotics and/or the delay of them.   Could and should be a real game changer.  According to AXDX they have already built quite a few of these devices, which would tell me they are pretty confident in getting their FDA approval.  They already have contracts for some of the biggest hospitals.   Totally a guess, but I am assuming this will hit ~35-40 per share if and when the FDA approves this device.   FDA approval was submitted on July 11th of 2016 with the average approval time of ~151 days.   I expect this to pop when that happens in the Dec-Jan time frame to ~$35-40 at which time I will exit.

I am long around 80k currently and waiting for this to dip a bit more so I can buy another 20k.  Yep, I have 100k I want to be all in on this with.

16-10-19,58cuiz,DD on Tesla unveil (in 3 hrs),"Last Tesla post for a while - I promise.

TL:DR I think Tesla is going to announce a level 4 autonomous (read:completely self-driving) update to all Tesla cars... tonight.

First clue:
On Monday Musk tweeted that he would delay the announcement until today (Wednesday) because ""it's not ready yet."" That tells us what he's announcing ships today, otherwise they could just fake it with a rendering or something. And since it wasn't ready to ship Monday and is ready to ship today, we can assume its software. Also, we can assume its shipping to all cars since there are no model 3s to ship to.

Second clue: 
At the Mode 3 unveiling Musk said the interior ""would be different than you're seeing"" as he pointed out there are no center controls where you'd expect them. Also, the steering wheel looks bolted on awkwardly. I have a hunch it actually was. Musk said the reason for that missing console _would be unveiled at the model 3 stage two_ release, which is what tonight is (according to his tweet).

I'll be adding more as I keep digging, but this realistically can only be a car that's designed around being fully self-driving (in which case buy buy buy) or some heads-up display (sell sell sell). 

Third Clue: Last year Musk announced that self-driving cars would be available to the public ""at the end of next year."" 

Fourth clue: I'm not as sure here, but the timing is interesting - right after markets are closed. I have a hunch Musk has a personal vendetta against his short sellers and wants to stick it to them.

Fifth clue: Tesla announces stuff all the time, but it's calling this ""an unveiling."" Also there are 30 mins of press Q&amp;A afterward. You don't do that if it's gonna be junky.

Again, I'm almost certain what is being announced tonight is a software update that ships **tonight**, and I think it's fully self-driving cars. Place bets accordingly.",44

16-10-19,58ar74,"What do you think, will AMD go up or down after the earnings report?",[removed],1
16-10-19,58arc5,"It's time to get off of the $A$M$D bandwagon, at least for now - DD post","$NVDA has just released the information about its new answer to AMD's hold on the low-end GPU market- it's the 1050, which will start selling on the 25th. This graphics card is at a significantly lower price than AMD's flagship 480 and will probably have similar performance, meeting the minimum spec for the Oculus Rift for only $109, which will be gaining popularity with the release of its touch controllers. AMD is left with two choices- become second-tier in all regards to Nvidia or drop prices. Either would be devastating to the company's GPU income.

So with AMD's GPU's out of the picture as far as its stock/earnings reports going to the moon, us faggots are left with simply hoping the zen line excels. Now this is possible, but very unlikely. This has happened time and time again with AMD's new processor lines- the next one will always be the best, the one that drives the company back into the green.

So, wrapped up- AMD is not releasing zen for a while. The stock is bound to fall in the short term as AMD has few to no viable products on the market. If you are an AMD fanboy, dump your stock now and rebuy shortly before zen is released to take your moonshot.

TLDR; dump AMD in the short term, rebuy before zen if you're a believer

Edit: I may be being cynical. This doesn't murder AMD but it IS a blow. With Nvidia as a viable low-end competitor to cards like the 470, gpu buyers are given a Nvidia card at every price point. It is my guess that a low end gamer will go for the 1050 and a mid-tier buyer is willing to shell out the extra $50 for a 1060 over a 480. I could be wrong though, I am just a faggot.",0

16-10-19,58dn7b,The Psychology Of Trading The Markets,"PSYCHOLOGY BEHIND TRADING:

Many of today’s highly successful traders will tell you that the general key to success in trading is to be able to comfortably take a loss. It is general knowledge among experts in the trading psychology field and among traders that the market is not predictable and it is safe to say that it never will be. In the world of trading, it is expected to take a loss; even those who are highly skilled traders know that it is inevitable. With that said, let us have a look at things you as a trader should be aware of, how you can take a loss effectively and use it towards the greater good of your trading world.

Trading psychology tells us that when a trader loses he begins to become somewhat of a perfectionist in his dealing. Many traders think that in trading, a good day will always be one that is profitable. Trading psychology experts tells us this is not true. A trader should define a good day as one where they have extensively researched and planned with discipline and focus, and have followed through to the entire extent of the plan. Yes, when a trader has mastered the art of accepting losses and working through them with a well thought out plan then good days will become profitable in time.
Because the art of trading in an unpredictable market fluctuates so greatly from one day to the next, experts in trading psychology believe that it is important that you concentrate on what you can control, instead of things that are beyond your control. Looking into the short-term you cannot expect to be able to control the profits of your trading. With that said, look at what you do you have ability to control.

You do have the ability to control the difference between good and bad days. You are able to control this factor by extensively researching the strategies you implement within your trading experiences. By learning to research your chosen strategies, thus controlling the amount of good and bad trading days you experience, you will, in the long-term begin to generate profits, which is the ultimate goal of every trader.

Trading psychology experts tell us that it is important to become realistic in trading instead of becoming a perfectionist. Perfectionist traders, relate a loss with failure, and will become obsessed with the failure, focusing only upon it. Realistic traders understand the unpredictability of the market and taking a loss is simply part of the art. The main key you must remember in trading psychology to be able to effectively limit your losses, instead of becoming obsessed with them. A common thing seen within the trading psychology world is that traders who are obsessed with their losses often have a hard time bouncing back from them, thus losing in the end.

Experts in trading psychology have organized three basic strategies you can use to effectively stop losses. These strategies are:

• Price Based
• Time Based
• Indicator Based

Stops that are priced based are generally used when the other two have not functioned. To make this work you will need to make hypothesis’s about the trade and identify a low point in that particular market. Then you will set your trade entries near your points, thus making sure that losses will not be overly excessive if the hypothesis fails.

Time Based stops constitutes making use of your time. Designate a holding period you allow to capture a certain number of points. If you have not achieved your desired profit within that time limit, you should stop the trade. If effectively used you should stop even if the price stop limit has not been achieved.

The Indicator based stop makes use of market indicators. As a trader, you should be aware of these indicators and utilize them extensively within your trading experiences. Look at indicators such as, volume, advances, declines, and new highs and lows.

Experts in trading psychology say that setting stops and rehearsing them mentally is a good psychological tool to use and will help ensure that you follow through.",16

I hear this all the time. ""You shouldn't try to time the market"". But what is this referring to?

Say I want to buy into equities, and I'm sure of it. But I try to ""time the market"" and wait until it hits a certain point in the short-term. That makes sense why I shouldn't try to time the market. The investment might not hit that point, thus making my strategy ineffective and losing out on the opportunity.

But why is this a bad thing in the long run? I think that at some point in the next 5 years that equity prices will correct and then will go up with Fed stimulation. Why is it a bad idea for me to go into the bond market until I see an opportunity that I like? If my strategy is long-term oriented, I don't see why this is wrong to do.

My only request for your replies is not to say ""well if YOU think it's a good idea then YOU do it."" Please let me know on a conceptual level why this is a bad long term strategy so we can learn together.",1

* How old are you?
* Are you employed/making income? How much?

* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)
* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
* Any big debts?
* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.

Be aware that these answers are just opinions of Redditors and should be used as a starting point for your research. You should strongly consider seeing a registered financial rep before making any financial decisions!

I opened an account at TD Ameritrade to buy some stocks that I've had for a little while now. Next, I wanted to buy mutual funds but I have heard that TD Ameritrade's fees are high. If after doing more research, I found that Vanguard had lower expense fees or Fidelity had lower expense fees, would it be a bad idea to open an account there as well? For some reason, I'm nervous about having money at too many places. And when I start my career, my employer may have their 401k somewhere else and that would be even another account. 

Is this a problem or am I over-thinking? Could any more experienced investors offer some advice?

16-10-20,58eafg,[x-post from r/CanadianInvestor] Private Placement as a Non-Accredited Investor,"(I am Canadian, as is the company I wish to invest in; I'm unsure if the situation is different for Americans)

I'm interested in participating in an upcoming private placement that is being offered by Emblem Corp, but I'm having a hard time determining how to proceed as a non-accredited investor.

I've been in contact with the Investor Relations team of the company that is offering the private placement, and they have indicated that as a non-accredited investor I will be required to ""go through a broker"" in order to facilitate my participation in the placement. They referred me to an investment firm which they indicated should be able to help facilitate the transaction, but my interactions with the investment firm have not given me much confidence in their ability to provide assistance, as they have indicated that they cannot guarantee my participation in the placement and that all I can do is to apply for a brokerage account with them and then wait for approval. They also indicated that they typically work with high net worth individuals or corporations, and so I think that they may not be the best fit given my status as a non-accredited investor and the fact that I plan to invest a relatively small amount (~$5,000).

I already have a brokerage account with Questrade, which I would prefer to use for this transaction, but all the information I can glean from Questrade's limited documentation indicates that private placements are only available for accredited investors. Interactive Brokers appears to have the same policy.

So I'm hoping that some of you fine people can shed some light on the following topics:

* As a non-accredited investor, is it even possible for me to participate in a private placement? The company providing the placement has indicated that it is possible if I go through a broker, but there seems be a lack of relevant information available online.

* Has anyone successfully participated in a private placement as a non-accredited investor? If so, is there any advice you can share?

* Do any discount or online brokers allow for participation in private placements as a non-accredited investor?

* If a discount/online broker is not an option, are there any recommended brokers that cater to smaller retail investors?

I'm aware of the risks associated with participating in a private placement and am not looking for investment advice from an investment adviser, I am simply looking for a broker that will be able to facilitate my participation in the placement.

Thanks in advance for any feedback!

16-10-20,58elh9,Manifesto – The Values of Value Investing,"Part One: Introduction

The relationship between a client and a money manager is like a marriage: even if you’re married to the right person, it’s just a matter of time before your relationship will hit hard times that test the strength of your marriage. After all, life is not linear, it’s full of ups and downs. The downs will ultimately test a couple’s commitment to one another.

Just like life, stock returns are anything but linear. Over the last one hundred-plus years, stocks returned about 11% a year on average. But if you were to look at stock market returns on an annual basis, they were usually anything but 11%. This 11% average is the culmination of a very combustible mixture of numbers that individually bear very little resemblance to the average they result in.

Side effects of nonlinearity of stock behavior clearly show up in investor returns. The financial services market research firm DALBAR studied historical returns of mutual funds and actual (realized) returns of investors who invested in those mutual funds. DALBAR’s findings were stunning. For decades fund investors had significantly underperformed the mutual funds they invested in, not by a percent or two but by a mile, capturing only a small fraction of the returns of those mutual funds.

For a civilian (nonprofessional) investor, understanding the investment process of a fund manager is usually difficult. Often, performance is the only thing investors can judge objectively, so recent performance overshadows all other metrics. Investors compare the most recent returns of their favorite new mutual fund versus the returns of the one they’re holding. If the new mutual fund has done better recently, they’ll sell the old one and buy the new one. This often results in buying high and selling low.

Any money manager, whether he is managing separate accounts or a mutual fund, will go through stretches where he looks smarter or dumber than he really is, though his IQ hasn’t actually changed.

When we look smarter than we are, we’re not worried about what clients think of us (though we try to temper their expectations of our future brilliance). At that point our biggest concern is our own self-perception: we don’t want success to go to our heads and result in overconfidence.

On the flip side, it’s just a matter of time before we look dumber than we are, and that’s when our relationship with a client gets tested. Especially if it’s a very new relationship and the client hasn’t had a chance to experience our brilliance.

Historically, value investing (owning undervalued companies) has done significantly better than other strategies. Paradoxically, the reason it has done well in the long run is because it did not work consistently in the short run. If something works consistently (key word), everybody piles into it and it stops working.

These aforementioned cycles of temporary brilliance and dumbness are not just common to us mere mortals. Even Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway goes through them. As just one example, in 1999, when the stock market went up 21% Berkshire Hathawaystock declined 19%. In 1999 the financial press was writing obituaries for Buffett’s investment prowess.

Suddenly, in 1999 Buffett’s IQ was lagging the market by 40%. At the time investors were infatuated with internet stocks that were not making money but that were supposed to have a bright future. Investors were selling unsexy “old economy” stocks that Buffett owned to buy the “new economy” ones.

If at the end of 1999, you were to sell Berkshire Hathaway and buy the S&amp;P 500 instead, you would have done the easy thing, but it would have been a large (though very common) mistake. Over the next three years Berkshire Hathaway gained over 30% while the S&amp;P declined over 40%. During the year 1999 Buffett’s IQ did not change much; in fact the (book) value of businesses Berkshire Hathaway owned went up by 0.5% that year. But in 1999 the market’s attention was somewhere else and it chose to price Berkshire Hathaway 19% lower.

Where are we going with this? We look at the relationship with our clients as a partnership. For this partnership to work we need to communicate on the same wavelength. In this letter we would like to establish this common wavelength.

I've spent all in all more than 150+ hours digging into and researching various articles, chatting with lawyers, economists, and combing through court documents. I am (literally) betting my house that FNMA will be released and recapitalized.

Proof for the cucks: http://imgur.com/a/KJfY8

There are multiple factors, and in short those are:

What happened in 2012 was definitely illegal(NWS, 3rd amendment). What happened in 2008, was also arguably illegal(Alleged Accounting Fraud - IMO this will be harder to prove, but truth be told i haven't read much into it) The housing market cannot operate without FNMA or FMCC, and currently the GSE's cannot continue to operate with zero capital. Despite what everyone says, Obama is incentivized to finish writing the story of the GSE's, as opposed to passing it off to Clinton/Trump. There is a warrant for 79.9% of commons to be issued out, which is approx 200B the government would gain under his tenure. (in addition to the ~150B FNMA and FMCC have already given to the Treasury) I'm not going to do your DD for you and I recommend each person understand their own risk appetite for investing in this stock as it is a long hold. At one point, I was down 40%, and then up 40%, and am currently down 10%. IMO - I'm looking for a price target of 7-10x my initial investment, so these day to day movements are nothing more than ""interesting"" to help me better anticipate how shareholders will respond to developments in the case.

If you're interested, I'd recommend reading up on the following:

Bill Ackman did a presentation in 2012: http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/IraSohnAckmanPresentation.pdf

This will provide a decent background, and i'll quickly list the important milestones

-2014, Lamberth dismissed the case. We've been appealing it since, and i purchased in late 2015 at an average price of around 1.89

-4/16, the court of claims, where discovery was currently ongoing Judge Sweeney basically blasts the government for abusing executive privilege. You can read about this here(https://timhoward717.com/2016/04/14/judge-sweeney-blast-government-on-their-misguided-attempts-to-hide-the-truth/) -It should also be noted that in the initial hearing, the government defended it's enactment of the NWS (net worth sweep - an amendment that changed the initial agreement of 10% dividends, to ALL PROFITS/LOSSES) by saying, ""we implemented this because we had projections of FNMA going into a potential death spiral"". In the documents Sweeney had released, you see email conversations between FHFA &amp; Treasury officials that they forecasted FNMA was soon to enter its ""golden years of profitability"". Literally the definition of perjury, however you're up against the government so the same rules don't always apply.

-Oral arguments for the Perry Appeal take place. You can listen here, and read an analysis here: http://seekingalpha.com/article/3988151-fanniegate-court-appeals-analysis-upcoming-court-decision and listen to it here: https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/recordings/recordings.nsf/DocsByMonday?OpenView&amp;StartKey=20160420160411&amp;Count=15&amp;scode=2

8/16-9/16: 4 Cases refer to Lamberth's ruling and also dismiss their case

9/16: Judge Sweeney in the Court of Claims grants motion to compel and releases all documents requested by the plaintiffs

Present: We really should be getting a ruling soon from the appeals court.

I'm not too worried about the four cases being dismissed. Lamberth set a precedent, and other courts are referring to it. In my mind it mostly hinges on the appeal, and in the event that fails, Judge Sweeney is clearly unsympathetic toward the defendants (Preferred shares stand to benefit the most, which is why I have half my holdings in preferreds)

1.Really you need to focus on the oral arguments. Ginsburg is clearly on our side, and you can tell by how he interacts with Olson and Hayne. There's a telling comment he makes to the defendent, when he says something along the lines of, ""Yes, but I read that as respectively being implied"" 2. Millet was aggressive with both parties. She grills Olson really hard, and seems to drive the point home, but still had a fairly stoic demeanor with the defendants as well. 3. Brown was fairly quiet, really couldn't gather much from her.

Edit: I should note the next catalyst is the appeal ruling. Lamberth basically ruled that the courts don't have jurisdiction over what FHFA does as conservator within the capacity of FNMA - which is a pretty puzzling statement coming from a judge, that they are essentially above the law? Not to dive to deeply into it, but the same panel of judges, (Ginsbury, Brown, Millet) recently issued another ruling, and their parting comment was "" Let the word go forth: for however much the judiciary has emboldened the administrative state, we ""say what the law is"" Marbury, 5 US (1 Cranch) at 177). In other words, administrative hubris does not get the last word under our constitution. And citizens can count on it""

Three Scenarios to come of this situation: 1. Affirm - Case gets dismissed, attention turns to court of claims, and FNMA drops by approx 50-60% 2. Remand - Case gets sent back to lower court with specific instructions, or i believe in some scenarios may get sent to a different court. FNMA goes up by anywhere from 60-150%. One would logically expect it to go back to pre lamberth ruling prices, which would be ~$5, and put that return potential at 250% 3. Overturn - Case gets reversed, the courts deem the NWS illegal and FNMA and FMCC are now allowed to retain capital. If this occurs, you can expect FNMA to go from 1.70 to, anywhere between (12-20). I am not expecting this favorable of a ruling.

Additional Resources:

http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FNMA -My favorite is Wayne Olson. He provides his own perspective and keeps it as objective as possible -Glen Bradford: His articles are slightly biased, but he is the fastest one to the scene and you can expect reliable updates from him. For the most part.

It should be noted that three fairly prominent hedge funds have a significant stake: -Bill Ackman, Pershing Square (Court of Claims) -Richard Perry, Perry Capital. DISCLAIMER -&gt; Perry Capital has shut its doors and is returning most of its capital to investors. The one investment he has decided to play out is FNMAS and will continue to fund the lawsuits. You can interpret this in one of two ways, but Perry Capital had something along the lines of 26 winning years before its recent troubles. -Bill Berkowitz - Fairholme Funds (Court of Claims)

The stock is absolute garbage right now. It shed 68% this year, is under-performing the industry, and recently cancelled its $620M order for a new oil rig. However, it's also run by Fred Fucking Olsen, and that guy and his daughter don't mess around. I can definitely see them capitalizing on new opportunities, especially once oil prices pick back up.

Every analyst has it as a sell right now which has caused mass panic, but I think their stock is very undervalued and as soon as they pick themselves back up and the market catches on, the stock will correct.

I am wondering how value investment funds work (e.g. Vanguard U.S. Value Fund (VUVLX)) . So, as a buyer I always expect all the companies in the fund to be value companies (like they are cheap currently). But if its always cheap companies the fund would never grow as it would just sell any company which is now coming out of cheapness (its not value anymore hence can't be part of value fund). But if they sell all companies which get expensive how do the fund gets any returns?

My theory so far (which I totally just made up) is that fund always contains value companies and when any company gets expensive enough, the funds sells it and buys some other cheaper companies from the profit. Hence over the time you always have value companies but will have more of them later and hence the value of the one share of fund overall will increase. Is this correct explanation?",3

16-10-20,58hvay,Inevitable pullback from SPY in Jan,"hypothetical question and a bit brain storming, if you look at the SP for the last 3-4 years (and probably more) every year in January SP dips on average 50-70 points, it is also called the ""January Effect"" as some of you faqqots know. Its a seasonal sale because of the tax purposes.

Now the thing is, retail investor is made to believe if SP dips below 2100 we will enter a recession. Currently SP sits at a comfortable 2140 with plenty of support around 2120. Personally I see limited upside unless OPEC deal actually happens and energy starts skyrocketing(a big if), we are still expecting a rate hike from Yellen and her crew around December(over 60% possibility right now, they are even considering 50 basis points and higher), which might double the effect of this sell off if it happens. A sell off from current levels, call it 2150, will cause it to get into the range of 2000-2100, which might trigger retail investors to freak out.

Question is do you guys think they will make the same mistake as last year, raise the rates on December and cause a huge dip in January ? Last year we didn't have this many articles about

""STOCK MARKET IS ABOUT TO CRASH"" 

""BLA BLA TECHNICAL ANALYSTS SAID BELOW 2100 IS DANGER""

16-10-20,58ial1,Explanation to whats happening with EKSO,"In case you were wondering why the upward trend stopped suddenly and we started losing ground, here is the explanation. Straight copy paste from ""cnafinance-Joshua rodriguez""

**As mentioned above, the declines that we're seeing from EKSO are the result of claims that the company is tied to a known fraudster. In an article on The Street Sweeper, Sonya Colberg pointed out the company's involvement with Adam S. Gottbetter. In fact, they pointed out that GottBetter became a ""key figure behind Ekso's private placement offering in January and February 2014."" Unfortunately for EKSO, Mr. GottBetter isn't exactly a stand-up guy.**

**In fact, after about seven months of the program, Gottbetter was sentenced to one and a half years. His crime... stock fraud! In fact, the SEC doesn't have much by way of positive words to say about Gottbetter:**

**""The SEC alleges that Adam S. Gottbetter orchestrated promotional campaigns that touted the prospects of microcap companies and enticed investors to buy their stock at inflated prices so he and his cohorts could sell shares they controlled and reap massive profits.""**

**""During one meeting in New York City, Gottbetter complained about the difficulties of stock manipulation but conceded that robbing a bank was the only other way to make so much money so quickly.""**

More or less what happened with YRD, complete utter bullshit news pulling the low volume stock down since investors are bunch of fucking retail chickenheads putting their money on anything they see green and taking out on any bad news coupled with red. Unlike YRD this is not a regulatory change, but just like YRD a misinterpretation of the news. It actually even leads me to think this might be a move from a big firm or a competitor as a retalliation, since we saw bad news first pulling down the price of ReWalk with shady IPO news, then Cyberdyne with FDA news, now EKSO with investment banker news. If you call it a coincidence you are actually retarded because there are only 3 significant firms making Exoskeletons.

Long story short, nothing has changed. This might delay the imminent take off of the stock for a couple months however I'm still hopeful to see 7.5-8$ a share before the end of the year. So I call anywhere around 5.5 a good average down&amp;entry opportunity.

ONVO 3D print's liver and kidney tissue used for drug testing by pharmaceutical companies, and are also working on 3D printed organs for human transplantation. 

Reasons why I love this stock include:

1) Unique product, few if any competitors (so far)
2) This company already has a real proven product on the market and big industrial customers now adopting it.
3) Their latest quarter saw very large gains in revenue and customer base.
4) Their pipeline is expanding and they just released kidney tissue this year.
5) Preclinical studies look promising.
6) Super cheap. Secondary public offering just diluted the share value 18%. Prior to this it has made great gains around $3-4.

16-10-21,58m7ru,Investing By Looking At Category Leaders,"If a category leader succeeds, [then Steven is right that they can do very well](http://fintekneeks.com/investing-in-category-leaders/), compared to a successful similar company that is not a leader - like bitcoin is the leader of cryptocurrencies, while litecoin is similar, but not the leader.  In some cases, like social media, the hands switched frequently, so venture capital investors (luckily, not mainstream investors) might have bought into hype from networks that didn't do well, like MySpace.

However, what Steve does show is an interesting pattern when markets fall (2009), the major companies in many industries do tend to perform well over mids and juniors when recoveries begin.  Other example of this are popular entertainment companies in 2009 and popular fashion companies.  If the overall market is down, these leaders are worth considering if you think that a recovery is likely.

My counterpoint to this idea of investing in ""leaders"" is that juniors might have a period where they do much better (miners are a good example - some junior miners really jumped the larger miners).

I'm a young guy, out of college a couple of years working a real job for the first time.  The money I save, I put into a Vanguard index fund and basically agree with the Burton Malkiel/Eugene Fama school of thought on investing.

But as a young guy, I'm not as afraid of risk as someone who's closer to retirement.  I believe that higher volatility/higher return is the optimal strategy at my age.  And when I'm older, a more conservative strategy will be optimal.

You could build a portfolio that's call options on the Vanguard index fund that will follow the same Ito process as the normal index fund but will offer a higher return, higher volatility strategy.  

So, why does this type of index fund not exist for people like me?  Or does it and I've just never heard of it?",2

1. An insider at a publicly traded company and created a 10b5-1 plan (in good faith) to buy shares during a normal quarterly blackout period that starts in a few days.

2. During the blackout period the insider called his broker and cancelled that plan and replaced it with a new 10b5-1 (still in good faith) in order to buy additional shares.  The new plan takes effect the same day.

  
I came across this scenario at work today and am a bit curious if that is just a convenient loophole or if it is not allowed.  IRL, I question the insider's ""good faith"" and think he was just using the 10b5-1 to insider trade as our stock price shot up just as he change his plan.  However, for the sake of argument, lets assume he was not in possession of material non-public info when he changed plans.

Coming from a non-financial academic background, this sub has been awesome for finding all kinds of information on investment strategies and theories. I'm currently working on building up my capital so I can implement a 4-fund Boglehead-esque portfolio in my TFSA (which I believe is very similar to a Roth IRA south of the border, at least in the sense that I don't pay tax on any income generated in the account).

One of the main issues I'm having is that my investment platform (RBC Direct Investing) doesn't give me access to the Vanguard funds that I typically see recommended on this sub. While I've found good alternatives for a bond fund and both Canadian and US index funds, I have yet to find a good international index fund. Right now I'm looking into RBF1033 (European Equity) - the only drawback being the MER of 1.27%.

tl;dr - has anyone come across a good non-Vanguard international index fund that they have considered investing in?

16-10-21,58q33i,Because people fuck.,"That's why stocks go up.

Since the beginning of time, there's newcomers to the stock game (a byproduct of fucking) who can't wait to short the markets in hopes of being right and getting rich.  It's the same people who tirelessly post about how this bubble will pop and how this growth is unsustainable.  They search the news hoping for some confirmation bias and point out wars, russia, oil, brexits, greece, italy, spain, justin beieber et al as justification for the crash and then get angry asking WHYYYYYYY the bullshit stocks just keep going up.  This leads to further anger and refusal to acknowledge they're wrong, they double down on the bet in hopes to martingale their way out of the hole.

So I made a chart [http://i.imgur.com/cM5dhSH.png](http://i.imgur.com/cM5dhSH.png). Stocks go up.

That's what they're meant to do, so don't act surprised when it works as planned. Yes there are these dips every so often, but the trick is to buy said dip instead of trying to bet your way into them because the other 95% of the time the stocks keep going up.  For those demanding to know why, it's because people fuck.  They make babies and as a direct result, prices go up.  Everything from your groceries to your toys, and yes your stocks.  Next time you're with grandpa ask him how much a car cost when he was young, then ask him what the S&amp;P was at and you'll notice they were both cheap. Besides, it's easier to buy a dip that you know you're in instead of guessing when the next one will come.

If you're tempted to short the market for no good reason other than ""well it just keeps going up,"" ask yourself if you're willing to short sex and human reproduction.  Because that's what you'd be doing.  What goes up doesn't always come down.  ",105

Lately i've been seeing a lot of posts from fucking autists showing bank loans that they use to yolo on terrible picks. Most of these poor fucks are so underwater and addicted to gambling that there will be no way for them to repay their loans.



**The Solution** 


We start recruiting these idiots and gambling addicts into our ""hedge fund"" and convince them that yoloing their loans on the market is a good way to make money. We can show them fake returns of people yoloing in the green to help convince them. At the same time we short the banks that are giving these faggots loans.

""A frequent problem with 401(k) plans is the quality of the fund offerings. You should look carefully at the fund expenses offered in your employer's plan. If its expense ratios are in general more than 1.0%, then you have a lousy one, and you should contribute only up to the match. If its expenses are in general lower than 0.5%, and particularly if it includes Vanguard's index funds or Fidelity's Spartan-class funds (which have fees as low as Vanguard's), then you might consider making significant voluntary contributions in excess of the match limits. For most young savers, fully maxing out voluntary 401(k) contributions (assuming you have a ""good"" 401(k) with low expenses) or the annual Roth limit will get them well over the 15 percent savings target.""

* DB's stock is down more than 40% YTD.
* Deutsche Bank is awash in toxic debt and derivatives.
* Authorities see Deutsche's instability as the single greatest systemic risk to the global financial system.*
* Deutsche's earnings have been faltering.
* Tightened regulations allow for less gambling which used to be their chief source of income.
* Deutsche Bank failed the regular US stress test twice in a row.
* Apparently the ECB went easy on Deutsche in this year's Euro stress test so the results wouldn't look so bleak.
* Employee morale is fucking shit, even DB's own employees think the bank is the work of Satan.
* Mass layoffs underway.
* Nobody really knows what would happen if Deutsche failed. 40 days of rain and a cleansing flood, probably. DB is seen as Too Big To Fail.

* **July**, shortly after Brexit vote: DB say how about we get some of that sweet taxpayer money, feast on the blood of lambs. Merkel says no fucking way. Later DB deny asking for help.
* **Late September**: the DoJ comes up with $14 billion fine for selling toxic CDO's and shit and basically bringing down the world economy last decade. Other banks have paid less.
* DB had more like $5.5 bil in mind. They say they're going to lobby the $14 bil figure down.
* **Now**: Everyone's favourite dumpster fire megabank is up over 30% since the DoJ number was announced. No reports of their effort to melt the DoJ's cold dark heart have been published.

It looks like the market is overextended on optimism that the settlement will end up much lower. If that doesn't happen (and I see no good reason other than Too Big To Fail) we should see the stock plunge back toward $11.

**The market value of the U.S. dollar has an impact on every segment of the economy, including the stock market. A strong dollar is synonymous with falling equity prices, while a weaker dollar can cause stock prices to rise. However, the relationship between currency valuations and the stock market is complex. A weak dollar is not necessarily good news for investors.**  - from the website zacks

Now the second information, from barrons,

Evercore ISI’s Dennis DeBusschere explains why the dollar is rising:

**The U.S. dollar index is up +3.2% since the start of the month, which has also coincided with a -1% decline in the S&amp;P. Fed officials have expressed discomfort with USD strength over the past year, but with inflation expectations increasing and credit spreads near their 2016 low, the pace of USD gains is not having much of an impact on December rate hike odds, which are still above 65%**


and now the last information, again from barrons

Rhino Trading’s Michael Block explains why the rising dollar is such a problem for U.S. stocks:

**I can sit here and say I don’t think the Fed goes in December but [the strong dollar is] telling us a different story. This is telling me that the Fed is going to start hiking and the futures market is putting that chance at 68% by December this morning. You couple that with Draghi taking the taper off the table, and the yuan in a slide, and Japan in deflation, and you have the ingredients for a dollar driven disaster. And that’s why stocks can’t break out despite the likes of Microsoft (MSFT) kicking ass and taking names on its quarter.**

**What are we going to do about this? That strong dollar, which will remain a fact until or unless there’s an explicit declaration that a hike is not happening this year (and how or why would Yellen do such a thing), is going to wreak havoc on U.S. industrials and I am happy to be short those in alpha capture. The materials stocks are cruising for a bruising and I am watching them to re-approach their highs from the summer before I sink my claws in. I’m still long a gold miner for this ride but will take profits in short time. Eventually this strong dollar should help consumer discretionary and health care stocks, so these may be the first I go to at the bottom of the range (below 2,110, in other words.) I prefer REITs in the bond proxy bucket over utilities and staples, but they all have their time and price. Financials may keep enjoying the ride if there is this hawkish bent so I am giving them room for now.**


*First take:* dollar &amp; stock market has still an inverse correlation about %30-40 with current macro variables

*Second take:* there is still room for a bull run before the end of the year

*Third take:* be cautious in industrials, miners, have an exit strategy.


Feel free to point out things that I'm missing. 


TLDR: in order to stop the strong dollar fed might raise the rates, which will cause a small bull run or even out the inverse effect in the following weeks since its pushing the dollar down since the dollar is too strong for its own good, or at least that's the plan.",2

16-10-22,58r5om,How Investors Should Deal With The Overwhelming Problem Of Understanding The World Economy,"By Vitaliy Katsenelson, CFA 

http://contrarianedge.com


“What the —- do I do now?” This was the actual subject line of an e-mail I received that really summed up most of the correspondence I got in response to an article I published last summer.

To be fair, I painted a fairly negative macro picture of the world, throwing around a lot of fancy words, like “fragile” and “constrained system.” I guess I finally figured out the three keys to successful storytelling: One, never say more than is necessary; two, leave the audience wanting more; and three …

Well, never mind No. 3, but here is more. Before I go further, if you believe the global economy is doing great and stocks are cheap, stop reading now; this column is not for you. I promise to write one for you at some point when stocks are cheap and the global economy is breathing well on its own — I just don’t know when that will be. But if you believe that stocks are expensive — even after the recent sell-off — and that a global economic time bomb is ticking because of unprecedented intervention by governments and central banks, then keep reading.

Today, after the stock market has gone straight up for five years, investors are faced with two extremes: Go into cash and wait for the market crash or a correction and then go all in at the bottom, or else ride this bull with both feet in the stirrups, but try to jump off before it rolls over on you, no matter how quickly that happens.

Of course, both options are really nonoptions. Tops and bottoms are only obvious in the rearview mirror. You may feel you can time the market, but I honestly don’t know anyone who has done it more than once and turned it into a process. Psychology — those little gears spinning but not quite meshing in your so-called mind — will drive you insane.

It is incredibly difficult to sit on cash while everyone around you is making money. After all, no one knows how much energy this steroid-maddened bull has left in him. This is not a naturally raised farm animal but a by-product of a Frankenstein-like experiment by the Fed. This cyclical market (note: not secular; short-term, not long-term) may end tomorrow or in five years.

Riding this bull is difficult because if you believe the market is overvalued and if you own a lot of overpriced stocks, then you are just hoping that greater fools will keep hopping on the bull, driving stock prices higher. More important, you have to believe that you are smarter than the other fools and will be able to hop off before them (very few manage this). Good luck with that — after all, the one looking for a greater fool will eventually find that fool by looking in the mirror.

As I wrote in an article last spring, “As an investor you want to pay serious attention to ‘climate change’ — significant shifts in the global economy that can impact your portfolio.”

There are plenty of climate-changing risks around us — starting with the prospect of higher, maybe even much higher, interest rates — which might be triggered in any number of ways: the Fed withdrawing quantitative easing, the Fed losing control of interest rates and seeing them rise without its permission, Japanese debt blowing up.

Then we have the mother of all bubbles: the Chinese overconsumption of natural and financial resources bubble. Of course, Europe is relatively calm right now, but its structural problems are far from fixed. One way or another, the confluence of these factors will likely lead to slower economic growth and lower stock prices.

So “what the —-” is our strategy? Read on to find out.

I’ll explain what we’re doing with our portfolio, but first let me tell you a story. When I was a sophomore in college, I was taking five or six classes and had a full-time job and a full-time (more like overtime) girlfriend. I was approaching finals, I had to study for lots of tests and turn in assignments, and to make matters worse, I had procrastinated until the last minute.

I felt overwhelmed and paralyzed. I whined to my father about my predicament. His answer was simple: Break up my big problems into smaller ones and then figure out how to tackle each of those separately. It worked. I listed every assignment and exam, prioritizing them by due date and importance. Suddenly, my problems, which together looked insurmountable, one by one started to look conquerable. I endured a few sleepless nights, but I turned in every assignment, studied for every test and got decent grades.

Investors need to break up the seemingly overwhelming problem of understanding the global economy and markets into a series of small ones, and that is exactly what we do with our research. The appreciation or depreciation of any stock (or stock market) can be explained mathematically by two variables: earnings and price-earnings ratio.

We take all the financial-climate-changing risks — rising interest rates, Japanese debt, the Chinese bubble, European structural problems — and analyze the impact they have on the Es and P/Es of every stock in our portfolio and any candidate we are considering.

Let me walk you through some practical applications of how we tackle climate-changing risks at my firm.

When China eventually blows up, companies that have exposure to hard commodities, directly or indirectly (think Caterpillar), will see their sales, margins and earnings severely impaired. Their P/Es will deflate as well, as the commodity supercycle that started in the early 2000s comes to an end.

Countries that export a lot of hard commodities to China will feel the aftershock of the Chinese bubble bursting. The obvious ones are the ABCs: Australia, Brazil and Canada. However, if China takes oil prices down with it, then Russia and the Middle East petroleum-exporting mono-economies that have little to offer but oil will suffer. Local and foreign banks that have exposure to those countries and companies that derive significant profits from those markets will likely see their earnings pressured. (German automakers that sell lots of cars to China are a good example.)

Japan is the most indebted first-world nation, but it borrows at rates that would make you think it was the least indebted country. As this party ends, we’ll probably see skyrocketing interest rates in Japan, a depreciating yen, significant Japanese inflation and, most likely, higher interest rates globally. Japan may end up being a wake-up call for debt investors.

The depreciating yen will further stress the Japan-China relationship as it undermines the Chinese low-cost advantage. So paradoxically, on top of inflation, Japan brings a risk of deflation as well. If you own companies that make trinkets, their earnings will be under assault.

Fixed-income investors running from Japanese bonds may find a temporary refuge in U.S. paper (driving our yields lower, at least at first) and in U.S. stocks. But it is hard to look at the future and not bet on significantly higher inflation and rising interest rates down the road.

A side note: Economic instability will likely lead to political instability. We are already seeing some manifestations of this in Russia. Waltzing into Ukraine is Vladimir Putin’s way of redirecting attention from the gradually faltering Russian economy to another shiny object — Ukraine. Just imagine how stable Russia and the Middle East will be if the recent decline in oil prices continues much further. Defense industry stocks may prove to be a good hedge against future global economic weakness.

Inflation and higher interest rates are two different risks, but both cause eventual deflation of P/Es. The impact on high-P/E stocks will be the most pronounced. I am generalizing, but high-P/E growth stocks are trading on expectations of future earnings that are years and years away. Those future earnings brought to the present (discounted) are a lot more valuable in a near-zero interest rate environment than when interest rates are high.

Think of high-P/E stocks as long-duration bonds: They get slaughtered when interest rates rise (yes, long-term bonds are not a place to be either). If you are paying for growth, you want to be really sure it comes, because that earnings growth will have to overcome eventual P/E compression.

Higher interest rates will have a significant linear impact on stocks that became bond substitutes. High-quality stocks that were bought indiscriminately for their dividend yield will go through substantial P/E compression. These stocks are purchased today out of desperation. Desperate people are not rational, and the herd mentality runs away with itself. When the herd heads for the exits, you don’t want to be standing in the doorway.

Real estate investment trusts (REITs) and master limited partnerships (MLPs) have a double-linear relationship with interest rates: Their P/Es were inflated because of an insatiable thirst for yield, and their earnings were inflated by low borrowing costs. These companies’ balance sheets consume a lot of debt, and though many of them were able to lock in low borrowing costs for a while, they can’t do so forever. Their earnings will be at risk.

As I write this, I keep thinking about Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger’s remark at the company’s annual meeting in 2013, commenting on the then-current state of the global economy: “If you’re not confused, you don’t understand things very well.” A year later the state of the world is no clearer. This confusion Munger talked about means that we have very little clarity about the future and that as an investor you should position your portfolio for very different future economies. Inflation? Deflation? Maybe both? Or maybe deflation first and inflation second?

I keep coming back to Japan because it is further along in this experiment than the rest of the world. The Japanese real estate bubble burst, the government leveraged up as the corporate sector deleveraged, interest rates fell to near zero, and the economy stagnated for two decades. Now debt servicing requires a quarter of Japan’s tax receipts, while its interest rates are likely a small fraction of what they are going to be in the future; thus Japan is on the brink of massive inflation.

The U.S. could be on a similar trajectory. Let me explain why.

Government deleveraging follows one of three paths. The most blatant option is outright default, but because the U.S. borrows in its own currency, that will never happen here. (However, in Europe, where individual countries gave the keys to the printing press to the collective, the answer is less clear.) The second choice, austerity, is destimulating and deflationary to the economy in the short run and is unlikely to happen to any significant degree because cost-cutting will cost politicians their jobs. Last, we have the only true weapon government can and will use to deleverage: printing money. Money printing cheapens a currency — in other words, it brings on inflation.

In case of either inflation or deflation, you want to own companies that have pricing power — it will protect their earnings. Those companies will be able to pass higher costs to their customers during a time of inflation and maintain their prices during deflation.

On the one hand, inflation benefits companies with leveraged balance sheets because they’ll be paying off debt with inflated (cheaper) dollars. However, that benefit is offset by the likely higher interest rates these companies will have to pay on newly issued debt. Leverage is extremely dangerous during deflation because debt creates another fixed cost. Costs don’t shrink as fast as nominal revenues, so earnings decline. Therefore, unless your crystal ball is very clear and you have 100 percent certainty that inflation lies ahead, I’d err on the side of owning underleveraged companies rather than ones with significant debt.

A lot of growth that happened since 2000 has taken place at the expense of government balance sheets. It is borrowed, unsustainable growth that will have to be repaid through higher interest rates and rising tax rates, which in turn will work as growth decelerators.

This will have several consequences: First, it’s another reason for P/Es to shrink. Second, a lot of companies that are making their forecasts with normal GDP growth as the base for their revenue and earnings projections will likely be disappointed. And last, investors will need to look for companies whose revenues march to their own drummers and are not significantly linked to the health of the global or local economy.

The definition of “dogma” by irrefutable Wikipedia is “a principle or set of principles laid down by an authority as incontrovertibly true.” On the surface this is the most dogmatic columns I have ever written, but that was not my intention. I just laid out an analytical framework, a checklist against which we stress test stocks in our portfolio.

Despite my speaking ill of MLPs, we own an MLP. But unlike its comrades, it has a sustainable yield north of 10 percent and, more important, very little debt. Even if economic growth slows down or interest rates go up, the stock will still be undervalued — in other words, it has a significant margin of safety even if the future is less pleasant than the present.

There are five final bits of advice with which I want to leave you: First, step out of your comfort zone and expand your fishing pool to include companies outside the U.S. That will allow you to increase the quality of your portfolio without sacrificing growth characteristics or valuation. It will also provide currency diversification as an added bonus.

Second, disintermediate your buy and sell decisions. The difficulty of investing in an expensive market that is making new highs is that you’ll be selling stocks that hit your price targets. (If you don’t, you should.) Of course, selling stocks comes with a gift — cash. As this gift keeps on giving, your cash balance starts building up and creates pressure to buy. As parents tell their teenage kids, you don’t want to be pressured into decisions. In an overvalued market you don’t want to be pressured to buy; if you do, you’ll be making compromises and end up owning stocks that you’ll eventually regret.

Margin of safety, margin of safety, margin of safety — those are my last three bits of advice. In an environment in which the future of Es and P/Es is uncertain, you want to cure some of that uncertainty by demanding an extra margin of safety from stocks in your portfolio.

I am saying this to help anyone out who was impressed by the gay system and maybe had a thought to invest in the company leaving this turd behind.  I have a few solid points to discuss and divulge in detail for you cucks so bear with me.  

First of all everyone in the commercial is in their mid-thirties.  I realize millenials are heavily indoctrinated into this sort of thing, but people grow out of mario.  Sure you might know a few grown ass men obsessed with one game like minecraft or RTS.  Some women like to play cutesy wittle games or maybe they don't and pretend to prefer the slit your throat and fuck the wound bloodbath kind of game because they try to be special.  Bottom line on this pint is that the age demographic they are going for in the ad is skewed way higher than what the actual consumer base is going to be.  

Second point here is the nifty clicky doo dabs and how gimmicky they all are.  The design of the system comes off as an antisocial mechanism where the gaymer can dribble and bug eye by toting their sad childish baggage in public now.  It's too cumbersome and even the most diehard faggots will think twice before posting up in an airplane with their retarded arms jerking the joystick with two hands.

Now, an addendum to that second point is that in the ad, the game was portrayed as easier to share with friends, who are grown ass adults by the way, and convince them to waste their time staring at utesy cutesy characters and pretty lights on a minuscule screen thereby making it a social platform.  This is wrong.  Even stupid people are not going to be impressed by video games in the same tired format.  It's like they took all of the same shit from their previous systems and said now this goes here and this goes here, when it's the same shit just moved around!  

My third and final point about why this awful cumstain on Japan's door handle won't get any decent sales and will flop is that the games are all worn out. This is not going to be the N64 of a new generation of cucks becoming myopic while jerking off to Zelda.  Not a chance! kids today are into the hard stuff from day 1.

16-10-22,58rfq1,$CME Earnings Thursday 10/27 premarket,"Consensus estimates currently place:

Revenue: 851 million $

EPS: 1.04

My estimates currently place:

Revenue: 920 million $

EPS: 1.20

Qualitative DD:

Historically, CME has received around 80-85% of their revenue through transaction and clearing fees. This means more volume = more revenue. 3rd quarter this year posted record volumes for natural gas futures and near record volumes for crude and gold. 

They are also currently slowly liquidating their 5% stake in BM&amp;FBOVESPA, which was positive throughout the 3rd quarter. This should further increase their cash position and buff up their balance sheet. 

The amount of income tax they set aside has historically been a smaller proportion for 3rd quarters than compared to that of other quarters. For 1st quarters, it has typically been around 36%. For 2nd quarters, 40%. For 4th quarters, 37%. However, for 3rd quarters, it's only 32%. 

1st and 2nd quarters for this year have been relatively strong compared to last year. Revenue for Q1 was 934 million compared to 842 million in 2015. Revenue for Q2 was 906 million compared to 820 million in 2015. I expect this strong YoY growth to continue to Q3 (revenue for Q3 2015 was 850 million).

TL;DR: short CME before earnings on Thursday premarket because I just posted this to wsb and 80% of my trades are losing trades",6

I'm leaning towards Fidelity's or maybe Schwab's based on minimums, fees, access to index funds and ease of distribution. Can't get much information on distribution except generic statements...

Have a few questions:

1. Can you instruct your DAF provider to provide the charity of your choice specific distribution instructions or would you have to contact the charity seperately and instruct them? Usually when I donate, I provide specific instructions on where the funds have to be used within their list of projects.
2. Does Fidelity's or Schwab's DAF or the DAF you use have access to low cost index funds and ETFs?
3. Can you buy individual stocks?
4. Do they have a good online interface for making common tasks like distributing funds to charities easy? 
5. Do they distribute by mailing a check or through EFT (any extra charges for EFT?)?

16-10-22,58rj9s,"Selling verticals. What's the catch?","Selling verticals has many advantages:

-high probability because if the underlying stays the same, you will still likely profit. this can go extremely high probability if you sell way OTM. 

-defined risk so you don't completely blow up your account

-very low buying power reduction

-can be very good ROI for the risk compared to simply going long or short on the underlying itself

I appreciate the occasional good yolo with buying way OTM calls and puts. However, selling spreads seems like the best way to consistently make money in the market.

The only downside I see is that you will never have massive gains from very big moves.  What am I missing?

now canadians are pretty much on the same stoner level as colorado so we can assume they'll spend about the same amount on weed 

Canada population: 35 million
estimated 1 yr marijuana sales w/ recreational pot: $7 billion 

since canada has 7x the population of colorado their marijuana market should be worth around 7x that of colorado

now for the good part.... TWMJF controls 50% of the medical marijuana market in Canada, lets assume they'll have similar success with recreational, since they have the infrastructure to do so, and say they'll have a 40% market share.
that means their 1 year sales after legalization (not including deals made with foreign countries) should be around 2.75 billion dollars

I am 18 years old and I jumped out off college because I really wasn't interested in the subjects I was reading. But then it hit me, and I came to realise that I wanted to be a Swing trader.


So therefore I'm just gonna go all-in and try to learn everything I need to know about Swing trading over a year (8-10 hours a day). Over the year, the plan is to, after some months, start buying stocks for very small amounts and try out my strategy. Then I will make changes until I have found a strategy that works for me. After the year has passed, I will start with the real deal, (I have about $22k to work with).

Is there any possibility for me to make a profit of about 70% a year, or $1280 a month, starting after the first year has passed, or is it just too hard to learn everything I need to know over one year?

*****

&gt; ###A flood of earnings, U.S. economic growth and some Fed speakers are set to hit markets in the coming week, and could help add confidence to a picture of moderate growth and an end to the earnings recession.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###About a third of S&amp;P 500 companies are scheduled to report next week, including Apple on Tuesday. Amazon.com and Google's parentAlphabet are set to post quarterly results on Thursday, the busiest day of the earnings season.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###""If nothing changes … we would say we came out of the earnings recession this quarter and that the second quarter was the final quarter of this earnings recession,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###Financials, materials and technology are expected to show the most earnings per share growth this quarter, Stovall said, while energy industrials and telecom are forecast to be the laggards.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###In the past week, financials were among the top performers after the major bank earnings topped expectations. The S&amp;P 500 gained about 8 points for the week to end at 2,141 Friday.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###Next week, ""I think really the big focus is going to be on earnings,"" said Casey Clark, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede. ""I think we're in a situation where investors are focusing on earnings and traditional drivers of equity markets. Part of that is there's more comfort on global central bank policy.""
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###A UBS study in October showed that over the last five years, the S&amp;P 500 moves more in sync with earnings per share than the level of interest rates. The correlation between stocks and earnings was very high, almost 90 percent, vs. less than 40 percent correlation between stocks and interest rates.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###The average year-end S&amp;P 500 target is 2,198, according to CNBC's Market Strategist Survey conducted in October. But strategists are watching whether earnings growth will sustain further gains in the market.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: S&amp;P 500 on track to complete 3-month losing streak**
&gt; Looking back to 1950, S&amp;P 500 has completed 33 consecutive monthly losing streaks of three or more months. With six trading days left in October, S&amp;P 500 needs to climb back above 2168.27 to avoid a third month. Should S&amp;P 500 fail to reach this bar, it would actually be a positive for November as 20 of those past 33 streaks ended at three months and within one month of the end of all streaks, three months or longer, S&amp;P 500 was higher 100% of the time with an average 4.72% gain. S&amp;P 500 worst monthly losing streak since 1950 was nine straight in 1974. When this streak ended, S&amp;P 500 also had the largest one-month gain, 16.3%.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: Week before Election more bullish than week of or week after**
&gt; Election Day is (finally) just around the corner. Next week will be two weeks before and it is also the week after October options expiration. Over the past 22 years the week leans bullish with gains exceeding losses by a margin of nearly 2 to 1 and respectable across the board gains. However, this same week (not always the week after options expiration) has nearly the exact opposite track record in election years. Since 1952, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have advanced during the week only 37.5% and 31.3% of the time respectively. The week before election week has a bullish bias that exceeds election week and the week after.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: 8th Year pattern back in play in an undecided election**
&gt; Whether looking at “All Presidential Election Years” or just “Eighth Years” in the charts below, the market is usually in rally mode near the end of October. Should the election go as polls suggest then the market will most likely track the “All Presidential Election Years” pattern to finish the balance of 2016. Should the election results be too close to call and trigger a recount in a state or possibly more, then the “Eighth Years” pattern would be back in play. An undecided outcome similar to November 2000 (an Eighth Year) would produce great uncertainty and could lead to declines similar to those that occurred then. DJIA dropped 5.1%, S&amp;P 500 plunged 8.0% while NASDAQ imploded 22.9% (tech bubble burst, not likely to occur again as valuations are not as extreme now) in November 2000. In the undecided scenario, it would not be surprising to see the Fed skip a rate hike in December in order to provide some relief to the market.

I have been working on the frontline and also overseeing operations management at this point. I have a regional manager above me but we work side by side for the most part. I was considering, on my own time, that I should see about offering the owners a percentage of my salary as an investment plan, and my regional manager suggested it on his own to me as well today.

I have no clue about the legal side of this and am wondering what questions I want to ask before I make these decisions. Ask myself. Ask my regional manager. And most of all how to propose it to the owners.

Furthermore, what legal documentation I will need to protect myself and my potential business partners.

I had a good laugh from it and moved on...
read it really quick.

But in light of all the stuff i recently have discovered while going through the whole wikileaks dump i remembered it and realized a loose connection to a lot of things.

So some girl talks to jesus and says the USD will plummet. what a nut job right? 

but what if the author was having a laugh while hinting at insider info? what if they knew something was going to happen to the USD on Oct 27th in China? 

I said ""in China"" because Oct 27th in China, is Oct 26th in the USA.

But what is Oct 26th? Its Hillary Clintons birthday!

What does her bday have to do with the US economy though, right?

Well, wikileaks have alluded to the fact that they havent released any DNC emails from after March 21st 2016. What significant event happened after that date though?

https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/789458342993354752

After that date, the FBI started their process of investigating Hillary for her email server crimes. Which they for some weird reason, decided not to pursue.

what do Hillarys emails have to do with her bday though right? well while looking at all the info flooding r/the_donald i found a link to these tweets from @kimdotcom

https://twitter.com/KimDotcom/status/786428040859361280

https://twitter.com/KimDotcom/status/760820727247282176

https://twitter.com/KimDotcom/status/768625694184091648

https://twitter.com/kimdotcom/status/766111600226873344

Kimdotcom seems to have insider info on the wikileaks dumps.


The original Jesus link is posted on prison planet, a website known for conspiracy theories. If someone had hillarys deleted emails itd be a place you might expect to find that person.

Maybe the post was a ridiculous troll, it definitely was not a little girl who spoke to jesus about the stock market, maybe it was someone hinting at their insider info.

What happens if Im wrong? well, on a normal day $FAZ moves up or down 2%. if im wrong i have a 50/50 chance of losing 2%. but if im right?

I know 2% is probably more than anyone here has ever lost so it might take a leap of faith tho...


also, if hillary wins, a lot of people are gonna freak out, and if trump wins, a lot of people are going to freak out.

16-10-23,58wafc,Some brief DD on Wayfair...,"Tonight I was bored and decided to do some DD on Wayfair (NYSE: W). Granted, I'm a bit tired, so I'm not going to post a full DD - the numbers I looked at all come from the most recent 10-Qs, so you can look there for yourself. 

Some things of note:

1. Wayfair has no debt. They do have $6.5 million dollar credit line with Bank of America but have never used it. Instead, the company is counting on revenue growth to grow its working capital so that they can put it into capex to fund future growth. 

2. The company uses working capital aggressively to fund future growth. You can see this in the expansion of accounts payable from 2015 going into 2016. As of June 30th, the company had $265,775,000 in AP, up from $148,447,000 on June 30th, 2015. 

3. Company is growing capex at a huge clip, compared to previous years. As of the quarter ending on June 30th, 2016, the company spent $61,436,000 on PPE, compared to $25,204,000 on the quarters ending on June 30th, 2015, and $24,331,000 on the quarter ending on June 30th, 2014. This is possibly related to the company opening up a call center in Maine and a call center in Texas as well as some other warehouses as of late. 

4. The company seems to be building a distribution network with which to receive and distribute furniture in a network of warehouses across the country. Wayfair used to tout their dropship model as a way to sell things without building infrastructure, but perhaps the company has come to a realization that they need to some infrastructure to ship things a bit more cheaply and efficiently. I don't see this as a minus, compared to what other people have said about the company's model. 

6. There is huge short interest in Wayfair. Per Finviz, nearly 27.70% of the shares are sold short. Despite this, the stock has demonstrated tremendous technical resistance at $35 over the past year. Any bit of positive news moves the stock up a huge amount, and the IV30 on the options (which are reasonably liquid for such a small market cap) is over 70 as of this writing. You can make a lot of money selling premium on W if you believe that the resistance at $35 will hold. I recently sold one put expiring on 11/18 at a $35 strike price for $230. 

5. My chief concern about Wayfair is that they will not be able to grow their topline aggressively enough to provide themselves with the working capital with which they need to create the efficient transportation network that will give customers the incentive to buy from Wayfair. Furthermore, the company's operating cash flows are consistently negative, which means that they aren't even making money on the stuff that they are selling. The company needs to better control its costs. Gross margin deteriorated recently as well. 

7. That said, Wayfair has one huge advantage - it is one of the few major websites to sell such a large variety of furniture online and its brand is slowly becoming more recognized and trusted. Speaking from experience and friends, Wayfair's brand is becoming more recognized as a result of word of mouth and if the company's predictions on demographics are true (millennials will soon start families en masse and many of them will buy home goods from them), then Wayfair is in a position to benefit, should they get their costs in order first. 

TLDR: Wayfair is a huge gamble and isn't financially stable enough to really invest in over the long term - yet. The company relies on growth to fund its growth, and should that growth engine falter, the company may not be able to shrink expenses quickly enough to compensate. Furthermore, the company's operating cash flows continue to be negative, earnings continue to be negative, but at least it has no debt given its precarious situation (thank god) but dilution through an equity issuance could be in play if things get dire enough. 

I'm bearish on Wayfair, but there are reasons to be bullish, particularly if the company can get its operating expenses under control and continue to grow its topline at the rate it has. It also has a pretty unique niche in online retail as far as I'm concerned and that is one of the company's greatest assets. The stock price will continue to seesaw between $30 and $50 for the time being, I recommend selling puts on the thing every time it gets closer to the lower end because the premium is just so juicy.

16-10-23,58wk2r,Does Autism actually help you trade better?,"Hi,

Beginner trader here. I've been lurking around these boards for the past few weeks, learning quite a lot. I think the most important thing I learned here was how important Robinhood is for an independent young trader like myself. Anyway, I haven't had any good trading ideas since I started, and I noticed that everyone here is always calling eachother Autists, or retarded. Knowing how much genuine respect the community feels for itself and all of its members, I have come to the conclusion that being Autistic is a positive trait in this line of work, whereby your retardation gives you the ability to think outside of the box. Is this a good assumption? Should I let my autistic younger brother make some trades on my Iphone 7 ?

If the media catches on, we will see all of these down 40%. And considering that Fox's ass depends on this election's results. We're 100% confirmed media coverage.

Companies involved:

Merck - $MRK

Bristol-Myers Squibb - $BMY 

Gilead Sciences - $GILD

AbbVie - ABBV

ViiZ (Private) is an offshoot of these two (Both of these companies have their AIDS medications under ViiZ):

GlaxoSmithKline - $GSK

Pfiser - $PFE

Jannsen Therapeutics (Private) is an offshoot of:

Johnson&amp;Johnson - $JNJ

Background: These companies, along with Hillary Clinton/Podesta/Clinton Foundation, conspired to keep the prices for HIV drugs up. Boycotts are being organized on Social Media. This has some potential.

So if you are interested in trading mean reversion this video explain why this is a great strategy to use with penny stocks. While penny stocks like to increase in price with or without reason there are opportunity window to trade the period when stocks start sliding back to its mean and by noticing this event you can make profits.

My other conundrum is when to start diversifying my portfolio  without taking a hit with commissions when buying multiple types of words every few months. 

I am looking to purchase some small cap or maybe mid cap etfs as well as some bond etf such as JNK.

16-10-23,58xdkq,FYI ahead of earnings week: Bulgaria has cheap real estate and low taxes,"Hey /r/wallstreetbets, ever thought about what to do when you get rich? I do, and I'm going to share my research with you. How is this trading related? Well, first off its a DD on Bulgarian real estate...kind of, and I assume this doesn't fall too far from our general lifestyle brand that we've got going on here.

So here's the deal: According to Wikipedia, in Bulgaria the maximum income tax is [10%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_rates)...you know what it is in the United States? [52.9%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_rates). FUCK THAT. I don't know much about taxes because I get someone else to do mine, but that sounds like a raw deal and the reason that I have like zero money always (I swear, its not the day trading I do on the side).

Ok, so taxes aside, what else is cool about Bulgaria? Uh, their [airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia_Airport#Airlines_and_destinations) is pretty big, they have some sick [burger joints](http://www.skaptoburger.com/), and cheap real estate. When I say cheap real estate, I'm telling you that you can buy a place that would normally be $1,200,000+ here in the United States for only $400,000. See example [here](http://www.bulgarianproperties.com/Two-level_penthouses_in_Bulgaria/AD50071BG_Two-level_penthouse_for_sale_in_Stara_Zagora.html). Or this badass [design loft](http://www.ues.bg/en/offers/6933-loft-9b-an-industrial-style-loft-brought-to-perfection) featured in GQ and Vogue.

16-10-23,590jv3,Advice for an investment in the field of IoT,"*I obviously invested myself, which is one reason I'm sharing this with you.*

I know that people tend to stop reading if ""Bitcoin"" is mentioned, this case however is different. 

As the term ""Internet of things"" comes up more and more, the tech behind it is developing fast. 

The following post aims for investors as well as developers to become a part of an interesting project. 

-&gt; IOTA. 

IOTA is an evoluted Blockchain-technology, like Bitcoin but more sophisticated. 

Crypto-currencies differ in subject to their field of action. Some are made for security- and anonymity-reasons, some are made as data carrier. 

While Bitcoin, as the most prominent one, aims to replace currencies, IOTA is made for the Internet-of-Things (IoT).

Iota's focus lies in the interconnectedness of devices to enable micropayment in short timeframes or: “to be the backbone of the IoT”

Why the name IOTA? It refers to the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet which is often used as “a slightest amount”. Furthermore the obvious similarity to IoT, hence the nomenclature. 

It operates on the Tangle, an evoluted Blockchain which has countless strong distinctions from a Blockchain to fit perfectly for the IoT. 

The biggest difference lies in the taxation of transactions, which is at 0.0001 BTC for Bitcoin transactions, but completely free for an IOTA- transaction. 

There are no blocks within the Tangle, and mining is not possible.

This disparity is of big importance in the world of Internet of Things as fees would handicap the transaction-environment of billions of devices. 

Further reading including a technical comparison between the Bitcoin Blockchain and the Tangle can be found here: https://medium.com/iotatangle

The scientific technical description of the Tangle can be read here:	 https://www.iotatoken.com/IOTA_Whitepaper.pdf

**To draw a conclusion:** For the first time ever, through IOTA people can transfer money without any fees. This means that even infinitesimally small nano-payments can be made through IOTA - worldwide.

IOTA is the missing puzzle piece for the Machine Economy to fully emerge and reach its desired potential. We (The devs. I'm not a dev) envision IOTA to be the public, permission-less backbone for the Internet of Things that enables true interoperability between all devices. 

A revolutionary, innovative solution for a Billion Dollar market. 

Important info for investors: IOTA is no pump&amp;dump-scheme, therefor it's right now, not possible to invest in it through exchanges, even though it's already 1 year in development. 
Exchanges will be green-lighted in a few weeks. Enough time to read about it. However, investing is possible through OTC-trading in the #trading - channel in slack. 


Feel free to ask, I'll try to answer everything.

Netflix is driving by with an $800 million offering of 10-year (non-call five) senior notes. Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs are joint books. An investor call is slated for today at 11 a.m. EDT.

Proceeds are for general corporate purposes.

The new notes will extend the company's cash curve beyond the 5.75% notes due 2024, and 5.875% notes due 2025, which closed on Friday at 110.5, yielding 4.08%, and 112, yielding 4.1%, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.

The 2025s, along with 5.5% notes due 2022, were issued in February and mark the company's last visit to market.

Terms on the B+/B1 transaction were finalized at the middle of guidance after a net $500 million upsizing. The ratings were assigned after a downgrade on the credit by S&amp;P Global Ratings to B+, from BB–, due to an expectation that ""Netflix will incur significant discretionary cash flow deficits over the next several years and that debt leverage will be high during that time.""
Netflix is an online provider of films and television programs. The company trades on NASDAQ under the ticker NFLX, with a market capitalization of roughly $54.6 billion. That is almost twice as high a market cap as when it came to market in February. Indeed, its share price rocketed almost 30% in the last month thanks to solid third-quarter results. — ~~[REDACTED]~~

16-10-24,594wec,Averaging down.,"Averaging down is increasing your exposure so if the ticker goes up your gains will exponentially be higher in comparison to your previous exposure you held with the originally purchased amount of shares. 

Let's say whatever authority who regulates ticker names decides to allow unlimited characters, caps sensitivity, spaces, and punctuation, in ticker symbols.

You buy 1 share of $You're a fucking faggot, which is trading at 100 chicken tendies, which is all you can afford because you're poor.

$You're a fucking faggot plummets to 50 TPS (tendies per share).
As you sit in your mom's bathroom, where you live, you contemplate taking an entire bottle of your mom's special vaginal hormone pills to end it all, but than you remember: your mom said no more tendies if you kill yourself... or was it unless? who remembers.

You drink a cup of your own diarrhea, fantasizing about the day you might be able to afford some Seagram's Triple Crown vodka, and you hatch an idea.

You travel to the mean streets of Paterson, New Jersey, and suck eleven ripe cock in exchange for 150 chicken tendies.

In exchange for three shares of $You're a fucking faggot and a quick conjugal visit, you pay Bernie Madoff 150 chicken tendies.

You than masturbate and cum onto a Robinhood statement stating that now your current level of tendies invested into $You're a fucking faggot is 250 tendies. You quickly again masturbate while watching every episode of two and a half men, and realize your current exposure is 150 tendies. 

You sit down in your favorite chair, which is actually just a one-legged bar-stool turned upside down, and sneeze; you quickly enjoy wiping your nose into the aforementioned freshly came-into robinhood statement. Okay so now you have 4 shares of $You're a fucking faggot, 250 tendies spent, which means your average price per share is 62.5 tendies, so if it goes up you can buy more paper cups to drink your own shit, and if it goes down, you can use the money you'll earn by masticating Bernie Madoff to buy more cups to drink your own excrement or something.

I'm trying to get an updated opinion on what 2 or 3 cyber security companies are, in this subreddit's opinion, most profitable?
Whether that's for short-term or longer, I figured it'd be a beneficial thread to others here too, no matter what suggestions and ideas come from it. 

Also, as my vibe right now is to investigate the profitability in cyber security as a whole, if anyone can recommend particular reading/learning out there that could assist me I'd be forever grateful. Perhaps investing isn't the key? Perhaps getting a job in the field is? Perhaps launching a smaller cyber security startup is the key?
Perhaps my childhood pet fish didn't jump out of its bowl and over to the other side of the ROOM all by itself, perhaps it was thrown there!?

I am considering some actions very soon (in other positions to manage my tax situation) that would be moderately helpful assuming neither of those deals closes in 2016, but horribly wrong in case either deal closes in 2016.  
  
I don't know if there is any track record for situations in which a merger judge has stalled and promises that pushes the decision into next year, whether the judge gets his/her way or whether such deals ever close in the originally planned year despite the judge's efforts.  
  
From the CI point of view, my understanding is that worst case for CI would be if CI backed out or stalled.  Better would be if the deal goes through, but best might be if CI aggressively supports the deal while the judge and government somehow delay it all the way past April 30 2017 (which likely means the deal would fall apart without the government ever convincing the judge of their bogus claim that the deal nets to anti-competitive).  As I hold CI (and HUM) stock at a big unrealized gain, I especially like that outcome, since I could delay a lot of taxes while CI slowly exceeds its buyout valuation.  I'd especially prefer my gain to not be taxed in 2016, 2017 or 2018.",1

My analysis shows that in fact this is accurate: most of the time, the day of Fed announcements, many stocks do in fact reach a high price that is 0.5% - 5% above the prior day close. So, on November 2, 2016, many stocks will increase considerably.

Stocks will generally open a little higher than the prior day close, they will reach a high price that is between 0.5% - 5% above the prior day close, and they will will close between 0% - 3% above the prior day close.

One particularly interesting part:

&gt; Mr Musk’s own finances look stretched. He has spent most of the $180m in cash from selling his stake in PayPal to eBay in 2002. He has personally borrowed $490m, secured against his Tesla shares, and most of that comes from Morgan Stanley, a Tesla underwriter. The car firm’s shares would have to fall by more than half before the loans went underwater.

Basically Elon Musk himself has near zero cash, and is half a billion in debt.",334

They took the best part of that video game, the simple card game, and created a stand-alone game called ""Gwent"". The closed beta comes out tomorrow. There is talk that this could be a strong competitor to Activision's Hearthstone and be a billion dollar cash cow over the next few years.

They also have a new game coming out which they've spent $100M+ developing, Cyberpunk 2077, though it does not have strong brand recognition.

Plus their digital distribution platform is making inroads.

what's really concerning is whether we have a democratic sweep in both the House and the Senate. and it's super rare (only happened like 5 times in history) but its a very real possibility because of many Republicans fueding with Trump (many republican party siders are very polarized) and Trump slowly losing traction in respectable polls 

if there's a democratic sweep - be prepared to see major crashes in the entire healthcare and healthcare-related sectors - drug pricing reform is a huge scare for these industries and it becomes realer and realer if dems sweep. once again, the chances have been historically low but they are probably the highest they've ever been because of Trump. if there isn't a sweep be prepared to see NBI rally back 10% from it's current decline

Conspiracy Theory: I feel like INO doesn't want to enter Phase III clinical trials for VGX-3100 yet. INO realizes that the whole proof of concept for nearly their entire pipeline is riding on these results. Ph. III was absolutely supposed to happen this year, until today when the FDA conveniently in the last hour delays till mid 2017 so they can verify the shelf life of a [plastic electroporation gun](http://www.inovio.com/technology/electroporation-delivery/electroporation-devices/intramuscular-delivery/). 

Why did the FDA decide to re-evaluate the shelf life of a battery operated toy gun!? Did Inovio tell the FDA to do it? Did INO ever even have plans to begin Ph. III this year like they said they would? So, now INO gets to spend several months dicking around writing up a little report about how their plastic toy will meet the shelf life they originally stated instead of prooving to investors they're a real player in synthetic DNA immonotherapy. It's an easy little task to perform and INO can claim it takes a long time due to bureaucracy. Meanwhile, they can wait for other value within their pipeline to form (Zika &amp; Ebola, which use a defensibly different intellectual property). Then, if the Ph. III Clinical Trials go poorly, they aren't completely bust.

16-10-24,59317c,Analysis on Chipotle earnings this week,"This is a very long post, so I'll give you a reason to keep reading. I brought you the recent TLRD earnings play that profited roughly 300-400% if you bought when I posted my thread. I also brought you the Macy's, at the very least, 100% profit play (if you bought when I posted) on their recent earnings report. If you follow my subreddit, you are up anywhere between 33-200% on OMER calls from last week; 20-100% on Ionis puts from 2-3 weeks ago depending on how long you held; a bit less than 100% on TLRD swing play from this month; Costco calls; Portola puts; etc. 

Continuing off of my comment in another thread, here is the full reasoning behind why I'm supporting Chipotle.

-

##**Pros**

Chipotle right now is in a negative limbo of sorts. I personally believe that they've successfully escaped long-lasting consumer stigma surrounding the recent E-Coli fiasco. The market however doesn't see it this way because of the massive inherent risk if we are instead presented an opposing scenario. 

-

We can thus assume that *all the market needs to know* is whether Chipotle's consumer base is decreasing or not. **Do not look at EPS for this play. This play is entirely dependent on comparable sales.** Quarter-to-quarter comparable sales are more important than year-over-year comparable sales for next week. 

As long as comparable sales stay the same from the previous quarter, I believe Chipotle will go up modestly around 3-5% (which would be a lot for most other companies). For a company this big, a 5-10% swing wouldn't be taken lightly, but for Chipotle a 10% swing is the far lower end of possible movement given even moderately good news.

Now, if instead Chipotle's comparable sales *go up*, I'm expecting ridiculous gains of at least 10% over the week. Chipotle has already proven itself to be worthy of hype given their enormous consumer loyalty with years of service. This is with very low operating margins, which means there is a strong possibility that Chipotle can cut down on costs in the future once done expanding their brand.

-

Let's entertain a quarterly increase in comparable sales. This will be indisputable proof that Chipotle's brand is recovering and that, in a year or two, consumers will have entirely forgotten about the E-Coli incident. 

As its peak, Chipotle was projected to run at an annual EPS of at least 18.5 -- putting them at a PE Ratio of roughly 40-50 depending on the share price you reference. An EPS of that caliber today would put chipotle at an EPS of around 20. 

That is why I believe, in this extended trough, Chipotle has a very good chance to explode if they announce their brand is recovering.

-

##**Negatives**

I never make a post to blindly hype a company. Every play has a downside, and the risks for this play are very big. 

Chipotle is, even after dropping over $300/share in a year, operating on a very large projected valuation. Similar to what I said above in the Pros section, if Chipotle presents the opposite scenario (a *decrease* in comparable sales), markets will no longer value Chipotle with such a high PE Ratio. 

We saw that the market recently took somewhat bad news on Chipotle and still pumped up share price. But the news wasn't bad only because people expected worse. For another quarter straight, if Chipotle presents *worse* news, no one can say that consumers have forgotten about E-Coli.

Realistic worst-case scenario, I expect share price to fall somewhere around $360-$370 if Chipotle announces a moderate decrease in comparable sales from last quarter. Predictions fall out the window when you imagine even worse possibilities. However, I strongly believe that Chipotle will not fall below $360 after *this* earnings report because we already have a decent idea of how the company is doing. There is a surprise factor, but it shouldn't be that extreme. A fall to $360 is also pushing it. 

-

##**The Play**

This play isn't for everyone of course seeing as these calls are very expensive. 

I was in the red on my 2018 OTM strike calls (440-550 strike) for well over 3 weeks, but I trusted my DD and bought more calls whenever Chipotle dipped below $400 or so. I'm finally in the green through the saving grace of Bill Ackman and last week's huge swings. I've flipped everything but my 440 and 500 strike calls, which I believe are good buys for the upcoming earnings report in terms of profit potential and relative safety. 

I don't want to lose 100% on expensive calls, so I'm downsizing my profit in turn. There are other, far riskier plays you can opt into. I don't recommend it though because of how violent this binary is going to be in either direction. 

-

Just so we're all clear: **These 440 strike calls are not meant to maximize profit/loss margins. Their sole purpose is to minimize risk and that's it.** I only play on 100+% risk/profit margins when I have less than 5 grand vested. I will go over riskier options if you wish to go that route. 

---

If you buy Jan 2018 440.00 strike calls with me...

* Realistic *maximum downside* of 35%. Realistic *expected downside* of 20%.

* 'Realistic' *maximum upside* of 40%. Realistic *expected upside* of 15%.

Jan 2018 500.00 strike calls are similar enough that I'm going to skip writing about them. They're cheaper but the profit/loss margin is also wider.

In reality, the realistic maximum upside listed above isn't exactly realistic, as Chipotle could go up 20% on good news. This would make the actual realistic maximum upside closer to 100%. But I highly doubt Chipotle is going to announce something that blockbuster. I mean, they could... I didn't think Netflix would go up almost 30% last week either.

-

If you want to go the YOLO route, I suggest Jan 2017 450.00 strike calls. These calls are significantly cheaper, but the downside could lose you about 70%. Upside is a lot or something at least close to a lot. Some other YOLO plays: 1. If Chipotle drops to around $395 underlying either today or tomorrow, I would suggest Oct 28th 420.00 strike calls; 2. If Chipotle drops to around $400 underlying, I would suggest Dec 16th 430.00 strike calls. 

These riskier plays are pretty dumb. In all honesty, I'll probably give in and buy some myself. But don't do it. Don't be like me.

## Recent financials 

So the business has been stable for many years, with 2015 taking a hit because of the strong dollar. 2015A also took a major hit from a one-off $1.4bn payment into their staff pensions.

But there's a clear surprise in the figures with Dividends greater than earnings in 2015. 

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $18.6bn | $19.7bn | $19.6bn | $19.5bn | $19.3bn|
|EPS | $2.77 | $4.04 | $5.53 | $4.42 | $3.99|
|Dividends | $3.48 | $3.33 | $3.17 | $2.92 | $2.76|

They trumpet this in their annual report stating

&gt; We raised our dividend in 2015 by 5 percent, the 43rd consecutive annual increase in our dividend... share repurchases and dividends in 2015 amounted to $2.1 billion.

That's pretty amazing, but I fear they are going to hit a snag. They've now paid out all their shareholders equity. So I can't see how they do any more buyback, unless they work out some remarkable financial engineering!

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Shareholders equity | $0.04bn | $1.0bn | $5.1bn | $5.3bn | $5.5bn|

## Competition

Given the 3 units, let's look at the sales and profit split, to it's the personal care business that leads the business.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Sales| | | |
|Personal Care | $9.2bn | $9.6bn | $9.5bn | 
|Tissue | $6.1bn | $6.6bn | $6.6bn | 
|Professional | $3.2bn | $3.4bn | $3.3bn | 
|Operating Profit| | | |
|Personal Care | $1.9bn | $1.8bn | $1.7bn | 
|Tissue | $1.1bn | $1.1bn | $1.0bn | 
|Professional | $0.6bn | $0.6bn | $0.6bn | 

Oddly they really don't given any competitor names in their annual report nor benchmark themselves, but the list is pretty obvious. And maybe they are ""hiding"" from the fact that their margin is nowhere near as pretty as the peers!

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Kimberly Clark Corp | $18,321M | 21% | 551%
Procter &amp; Gamble Co | $65,299M | 27% | 16%
Colgate-Palmolive Company | $15,505M | 29% | 1620%
Clorox Co | $5,761M | 21% | 312%
Unilever N.V. (ADR) | $57,200M | 18% | 33%
Edgewell Personal Care Co | $2,312M | 22% | -ve

## Cash / Debt?

With $7,085M of net debt, KMB is at 1.9x its latest operating profit. That's rather high, though given they've been buying back shares to the extent the equity's been all paid out, it's not a surprise.


# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $136.17 for Kimberly Clark Corp and their recommendation to clients is _Hold_. That implies an upside of 14% to their target.

# Valuation

What a Hold? When the target price is up 14% from here? It's as if the brokers haven't revisited the figures is 3 months. Back when the stock was $133 and their target was $138.

# Dividends

Kimberly Clark Corp is forecast to pay a dividend of $3.67 per share, which would be a 44th year of expansion. and it compares to a forecast EPS of $6.07. Though I suspect that EPS is an adjusted EPS rather than reported.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -10% that compares with no change in the earnings forecasts. That's against a backdrop of sales off 3% in the first 9 months. Though today the clearly missed on earnings and sales by a several percent for the 3rd quarter. 

On today's call they were clearly disappointed to have missed, with a tough environment, FX against them, etc. But they talked the good talk on returns for shareholders, operational efficiencies etc.

Still, it's hard to see where the catalyst is. Does it need to be split up? Is it sub-scale in any of it's units and need to get bulk?

Seems like a solid business, earnings-miss aside, but maybe we can wait?

16-10-24,5970lc,My personal experience shows how hard stock picking is,"I have a brokerage account with Fidelity. From about 2000 to 2002, I created a ""watch list"" of 15 companies, taking the price at the time and making theoretical investments. I actually forgot about it until yesterday, when I took a look. And what I saw shocked me:

My best ""theoretical"" investment was in Adobe Systems, up 279% 
But then it gets ugly:
Sycamore Networks was DOWN -98.73%
Ciena Networks was down -58.47%
Nokia was down -80.51%
Microsoft was only up 14% over more than 12+ years
Cisco was up 52%, again, over 12+years
Redback went bankrupt. So, down 100%. 

I'm in tech, and I'd like to think, at the time at least, I knew what I was doing. I knew these companies. Networking was really hot and the place to invest. Their management teams seemed really smart. Analysts raved about them. Microsoft had billions in the bank and could do no wrong. And yet most of these were terrible, terrible investments. 

For a long time now I've just invested in index funds, and I think this shows why. The S&amp;P 500 would have easily outpaced this horrible portfolio. ",4

16-10-24,597yab,$WY,"Throwing this out there for those curious, but Weyerhauser ($WY) looks like an interesting case for a near-term short. It's apparently listed as an REIT (strangely), but it makes engineered wood products (EWP's) for home construction.

Just like Boise Cascade ($BCC), which took a fat dump this morning after rough Q4 guidance and near-same YoY sales. From what I can see as a design engineer that works in single- and multi-family home construction in SoCal, Weyerhauser tends to dominate here and throughout most of the country, except for the Colorado area, which Boise Cascade seems to control.

$WY's market cap is on the order of 25x that of $BCC, but they both have suffered from the housing market to the point that their debt/equity ratios are badly skewed. $WY has apparently been selling off parts of its business recently, probably in part to generate cash flow to pay off some of its debt.

As a last note, both $BCC and $WY were rated as a ""Buy"" by Goldman Sachs during its latest review of the building supply markets ~2 weeks ago. Clearly, they did their homework.

Volume on the options chain is garbage, even with its ER on the 28th (Friday PM), so perhaps the best way to short this one without a big hit to buying power would be to short the underlying and buy OTM calls.

I would get in on this if I had margin, but I don't have the liquidity for margin quite yet, so I thought I could toss WSB a potential bone and live vicariously through one of y'all.",1

Top performer gets full 15%, all the way to worst performer who gets 0%.

- Any asset: stock, bond, fund, ETF, commodity, currency, alternative asset etc is acceptable.

- The investment must be a single idea and it must be investable as well as trackable for either a high net worth (HNW) investor or an institution.

- Handouts should include (among other things) the investment symbol, its most recent price, upside price target, downside sell target, the risks to the investment and the reasons for choosing the investment.

here's my story: when I was living in the USA, I had some extra income that I decided I want to invest. Got a little carried away and invested most of the disposable income. In general, it's not that badly allocated (mostly lazy portfolio ETFs) but there are a few bad stock-picking decisions. 

**IBB** - I purchased 5 shares of IBB at $360/share for $1800 total. Today, that's a $460 or 25,5% loss for me.

I am now back in my post-communist shithole of a country and would like to avoid further losses. Are there any reasons to believe IBB will at least return to its former levels?


One other complication is my tax status - all of my investments are located in the USA. Any gains I make are taxed and if I sell something, I need to file taxes in that fiscal year. So - if I go and sell the IBB now at a loss, I loose the chance to use that loss to offset gains (gained by selling some of my better performing choices) in the future. I do not feel like selling some of the gains right now but don't want to risk potential larger IBB loss.


I hope that makes sense. To put it into perspective - why am I doing so much thinking because of only $460 - that's more than the average monthly salary where I live right now so it's kind of a big deal.",8

16-10-25,59bgun,"Some interesting small caps I've been watching.","Since July I've been following two particularly interesting small cap stocks. Based on fundamentals and forward expectations these two consumer discretionary companies should be performing much better, in my opinion.  

Nasdaq:TTS

In July this company posted huge EPS and their balance sheet looked great.  Current ratio was strong, debt being paid at a good rate, new store opens near the high end and improved revenue estimates.  The only things negative were a decrease in cash flow and forward seasonally reduced EPS.  I figured low summer volumes and a couple reasons to short, whatever.  I'm long because I see a consistently underpriced growth company, but I didn't stress because I did my due diligence and checked the macro environment and it turns out the housing market is doing extremely well where TTS has most of its stores.  New builds and existing home sales also did great over the summer.  I was able to convince myself that not only cash flows would increase, but that the company would also post an earning surprise.  I was correct.  On October 18 TTS released their third quarter results and they beat all expectations.  Sales were up, cash flows are near Q2 levels (very high), EPS beat by $0.02 and expenses are all down.  Key margins all improved and they paid off a good chunk of their long term debt.  If that's not enough, CEO also mentioned that debt will be paid off mid 2017 and the company will likely offer buy backs or dividends to handle their excess cash.  After attending the meeting and noticing that forward guidance and cash flows had been significantly revised upwards I expected TTS to be trading at or near $19 on release date.  It touched 18.66 and has been slowly decaying since.  I attribute this to pre-election jitters and the overhype surrounding a measly 0.25% rate increase in December which isn't even a guarantee (watch for GDP this week and CPI going into the December meeting).  TTS is currently trading at $17.35 but fair market value is closer to $19.50-$21.  This is a good stock to consider now as they tend to perform best, on a cyclical sense, during the spring and Q4 is only expected to bring more value to this company. Spring is also when the company expects to release news about dividends or buybacks.  

NYSE:TGNA

Man where to begin with this poor thing.  Between 2014 and 2015 this company performed a spin off and divided into two separate companies.  As a result TGNA saw a 50% reduction in revenue.  Now, between 2015 and 2016 this stock has hit record lows.  TGNA has one of the lowest P/E ratios on the market, which leads me to believe bears aren't looking for properly valued stocks, their just whining because the stocks they want are too expensive for their checkbooks.  Anyhow, TGNA has consistently beat EPS estimates for the past 12 quarters and revenue guidance keeps going up.  In July 2016 they posted numbers that, when crunched, represented a $25 stock in my opinion.  Looking at consensus ratings it's apparently the analysts covering TGNA have no real idea how to value this company, given that the price targets range from 21-34$.  TGNA is currently trading at $19.88 and falls more every day.  This is even more confusing given the fact that the stock has 3 strong buy and 4 hold recommendations.  Not only that but in September TGNA hosted a conference call announcing their plans to spin off cars.com (valued between $8-$12 per share and represents 33% of company net worth) as well as the sale of career builder to pay off debts and provide some returns for investors.  The stock boosted 2$ that day but was quickly short sold into the dirt over the coming weeks.  At that same conference call TGNA CEO mentioned that they were on pace for high end revenue estimates this quarter, placing them near the 1B mark- much stronger than the 850k+ that has been posted the past 2 quarters.  The company also offers a 0.14 dividend.  With increasing balance sheet, increasing cash flow, increasing EPS, a tax-free spin off in the short term, a dividend yield and an oversold RSI I can't imagine this stock stays this low for much longer.  It's clearly a strong buy with massive upward potential and tax-based incentives.  Get it while you can, because here's the catch 22.  It's owned almost entirely by institutional investors and if you pay close attention to price spikes you'll notice very small windows of opportunity.  Buy now and remember to get out when the getting's good.  Once the price spikes, it spikes fast.  ",5

Let's look at Iraq's current situation. The Iraqi government makes ~90% of it's revenue from oil and they are in massive need of funding. [Back in July](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2016/07/12/14/31/NA071416-Iraq-Gets-IMF-Loan-to-Support-Economic-Stability) the IMF approved a 5.34 billion loan to Iraq to help stabilize the 18 billion funding gap Iraq is faced with due to oil prices.

ISIS Is pushed back to Mosul, Iraq wants to get them the fuck out and they need cash to do so. 

On top of all that, there's no way the Kurds are going to lower their production if Iraq does. That'll ruffle some feathers in that revenue-sharing clusterfuck. 

TL,DR: Iraq looks like it isn't going to lower production anytime soon, down 18 bil, needs money to fight ISIS. Expect them to try everything to get out of this, if OPEC lets Iraq get out, they'll have less pressuring power on other larges producers like Nigeria.

For the foreseeable future Amazon is always going to be the leader in online shopping and making consistent money there. But things like this Twitch update might fly under the radar of analyst and might not be priced into the SP before earnings.

Based on that retarded DD, I would bet on AMZN having an extremely bullish earnings report.

16-10-26,59fj8d,What do you guys think about pharma stocks and the upcoming election?,"I heard someone recently talking about how pharma stocks have been struggling since the ACA went into effect. If that's true, wouldn't a Trump win (with GOP congress) mean a huge spike in pharma stock value when they inevitably repeal the ACA?

What, if any, effect does the ACA actually have on pharma companies? And would a Clinton win (which seems more likely every day according to the media) mean trouble for pharma companies that were holding out for a GOP win? 

I'm pretty new to pharma stocks and companies, and have made money on random gambles (SKLN was my biggest gainer overall) but I still don't understand the industry that much. To me, it doesn't make sense because the ACA only really got more people insured, which should mean drug companies are getting more business right? It's hard to get a straight answe on this without any political bias. Any insight is appreciated, thanks all. ",2

Transcript:
AutoNation, the largest automotive retailer in the United States. Shares have declined throughout 2016 on concerns that US auto sales have reached a peak, and that earnings growth over the next several years will be difficult to come by. Earlier in 2016, the company’s CEO Mike Jackson called out automaker overconfidence that each could gain market share, leading to overproduction and excess inventory that has hurt dealers throughout the year. We believe share reaction has been too severe, and view shares as attractive heading into 2017.

We expect AutoNation to earn $4.40 this year, growing to $4.70 next year, putting shares at just 10x earnings despite expected growth in the company’s highly profitable Parts &amp; Service division. Shares currently trade at over a 25% discount to our 2017 Private Market Value estimate of $64 per share.

As for the aftermarket, we will explore the potential for online penetration, especially from competitors such as Amazon, the possibility for gas prices, currently at historic low, increasing and pressuring miles driven, more and more part complexity, and dealer encroachment on traditional aftermarket customer share.

One idea which we are particularly excited about is Axalta.  Which is a coatings company uniquely positioned to serve both the OEM and aftermarkets. We believe that investors have oversold in response to PPG’s pre announcement two weeks again which indicated slowing global GDP growth. We continue to  see the 1.2 billion vehicles on the road as a strong driver for Axalta’s 45% aftermarket business while emerging market growth and a push towards environmentally products should drive OEM opportunities.  We have a Private Market Value of $30 in 2016 growing to $37 in 2017.

16-10-25,59d7jp,Why Twitter will beat (DD inside),"Twitter has been a dumpster fire for years. With buyout rumors dying down it looks like there's not a lot of hope for this company. 

But at its heart Twitter is a news company. Terror attacks, political debates, shootings, wikileaks, etc have all been big news. There's been a ton of big news lately and this should be attracting people to Twitter. This may be temporary as all the election craziness has been driving huge news cycles, but it could be good news for this quarter. Expectations are set pretty low for Twitter anyway so I doubt a miss will have a huge immediate effect on stock price, but I see it sinking back down to 14 over a few weeks if it misses. 


TLDR: Election craziness should have increased revenue for Twitter in Q3. A miss in Q3 earnings may already be priced in to an extent. ",2

&amp;nbsp;

* Does the CB2 receptor do anything at all?

&amp;nbsp;

The article questions the use of any CB2  as a anti-inflammatory (NSAID) pain reliever. This is easily dismissable as there are many papers on the significance of the CB2's role in inflammation. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2768535/


&gt;**There is currently a large body of data indicating that the CB2 plays a functionally relevant role during inflammation.** This role is especially evident for cells of myeloid lineage, including macrophages and macrophage-like cells, as well as microglia that are resident in the CNS. 


&amp;nbsp;


* Does the fact that CB2 drugs with a similar binding affinity compared to Resunab, such as Hu-308 have failed in the past mean that Resnunab is doomed for failure?

&amp;nbsp;


Well, its not certain either way. Research does in fact show that ajulemic acid (resunab) has similar rates of binding affinities as Hu-308 as seen here:

http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968089614003368


&amp;nbsp;

However, Affinity does not equal the effectiveness of the drug. In this paper, 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4507227/

the drug HU-433 had a lower binding affinity and a much more significant biological potency when compared to HU-308

&amp;nbsp;

We also see the difference in potency when you consider that it takes about 50mg/kg of HU-308 to show about a significant anti-inflammatory response

 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4507227/
(same article as above)

where as it takes resunab only 0.1 mg/kg to show a similar response. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4351512/

(JBT-101 is reunab)

&amp;nbsp;

So even though Resunab has a similar affinity to HU-308, it doesn't mean that it will not be effective and fail like HU-308. 

&amp;nbsp;

Does this mean that Resunab will succeed? No. I am not certain about anything in the future, but I am certain that Feuerstein isn't either. ",15

16-10-26,59kgsd,stockAday: ETF fun with the golden one? i.e. $GLD,"# Key Stats for SPDR Gold Trust (ETF)

Let's have some ETF fun and look at the Gold one!

|Ticker|[GLD](https://stockflare.com/stocks/gld)
|:---:|:---:|
Sector | Exchange Traded Funds
Latest price | $120.92
Value | $39 billion
Daily vol | $1.1 billion
Date | 26 October 2016

### Useful Links
* Latest analysis from [ETF.com](http://www.etf.com/GLD) and [ Morningstar](http://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/gld/quote.html)
* Website: [spdrgoldshares.com](http://www.spdrgoldshares.com/)

# Description

* SPDR Gold Trust holds gold and from time to time issues SPDR® Gold Shares, or Shares, in Baskets in exchange for deposits of gold and distributes gold in connection with redemptions of Baskets.
* The Shares are intended to offer investors an opportunity to participate in the gold market through an investment in securities. 
* Historically, the logistics of buying, storing and insuring gold have constituted a barrier to entry for some institutional and retail investors. The ownership of the Shares is intended to overcome these barriers to entry. The logistics of storing and insuring gold are dealt with by the Custodian, and the related expenses are built into the price of the Shares. 
* Therefore, the investor does not have any additional tasks or costs over and above those associated with investing in any other publicly traded security.

# Strategy 

Well, the strategy is quite obvious, isn't it? Buying gold. 

As they say on their website:

&gt; As an asset class, gold is unique. The economic forces that determine the price of gold are different from the economic forces that determine the price of many other asset classes such as equities, bonds or real estate. Gold offers investors an attractive opportunity to diversify their portfolios.

Hard to disagree with it being a unique way to diversify. Though the question I always ask myself is: why bother? 

# Efficiency / Fees

Now the GLD isn't the only Gold ETF but at $39 billion it's the granddaddy. So rather than benchmark it against iShare's $9bn $IAU fund (0.25% fee v GLD's 0.40% per annum). Let's look at non-obvious peers:

* Vanguard's Basic Materials ETF, given they include a lot of miners who are digging gold out of the ground, among other things
* PowerShare's Commodity Index ETF, since you could look at a broader commodity play as a away to diversity
* Vanguard's TIPs inflation protected ETF, since Gold is looked at as an inflation hedge

|Metrics|Expense Ratio| Tracking Error|Uses Derivatives|Stock Lending Fees|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|SPDR Gold Trust $GLD | 0.40% | -0.37% | No | n/a |
|Vanguard Materials $VAW | 0.10% | -0.06% | No | 100% to Fund :) |
|PowerShares DB Commodity ETF $DBC | 0.67% | -1.30% | No | n/a |
|Vanguard Inflation Protected $VTIP | 0.08% | -0.08% | No | 100% to Fund :) |

Clearly it's not cheap at 40bps a year, though given there is a physcial product to store...I suppose it's not terribly epensive. 

# Asset Allocation

The asset allocation won't shock you, it's in gold. So let's have a little fun and try and understand the drivers of gold.

|	Tonnes	|	2010	|	2011	|	2012	|	2013	|	2014	|
|	:---	|	:---:	|	:---:	|	:---:	|	:---:	|	:---:	|
|	SUPPLY	|		|		|		|		|		|
|	Mine Production	|	2,754	|	2,834	|	2,924	|	3,061	|	3,133	|

|	Net Hedging Supply	|	0	|	32	|	0	|	0	|	95	|
|	Total Supply	|	4,290	|	4,542	|	4,568	|	4,307	|	4,400	|
|	DEMAND	|		|		|		|		|		|
|	Jewellery Fabrication	|	2,108	|	2,183	|	2,197	|	2,732	|	2,483	|
|	Industrial Fabrication	|	408	|	381	|	360	|	348	|	347	|
|	Net Physical Investment	|	1,118	|	1,379	|	1,284	|	1,700	|	1,010	|
|	Net Hedging Demand	|	118	|	0	|	47	|	30	|	0	|
|	Net Official Sector Purchases	|	104	|	516	|	582	|	648	|	588	|
|	Total Demand	|	3,856	|	4,460	|	4,471	|	5,458	|	4,428	|

The supply side of the equation looks pretty stable, where the volatility comes is on the demand side with *investment* and *central banks* causing the big swings.

The second thing that stands out is the huge size of the Jewellery and Industrial businesses. If anyone pooh-pooh's gold to you as a useless commodity with no intrinsic value, then stop them. Please. it's got a lotta demand as a product.

# Valuation

There really isn't any way to judge the valuation that I can think of. Okay, I can get a yield on the Materials ETF, a negative yield on the TIPS and nothing on GLD or DBC, but it's really not about yield is it?

# Well?

So looking at ETFs, I like to come to think of 3 questions (1) Am I happy with the asset itself? (2) happy with this specific strategy? (3) Happy with the provider of the ETF?

1. Well, this is a gold ETF, so, I'm happy enough with the asset class and underlying as an uncorrelated asset. Though I really can't see myself having more than a low single digit allocation to it.

2. Now when it comes to strategy, I wonder, maybe I should just buy a basket of gold miners. Aren't they a leveraged play, and they have end customers?

3. And finally, what about GLD itself... well frankly, as a cheapskate, why would I pay 0.40% per annum v 0.25% at iShares.

16-10-26,59gol7,"Predictions for AAPL stock. Stocks plunge 3% after earnings call, is it time to buy?","So I was correct yesterday in predicting a pullback to $115 or lower after Apple announced their earnings. I've been analyzing AAPL stock for months now and this is NOT a stock to buy, in my opinion. 

It is a stock to hold at this stage because of the post-earnings dip and the potential for Apple to surprise us with a much overdue new growth engine product. 

Many investors were buying AAPL stock yesterday before earnings release in anticipation of an earnings surprise and for the stock to go up a healthy 3~5%. Instead, the stock dropped 3% after market hours, which looks like it will be an even bigger 3.5% dip this morning pre-market. 

So will the stock stabilize at $115? My predictions are as follows:

1. AAPL stock will retreat back to the $107~$109 support level and will remain 'trapped' for some time. It could plunge to $90~$100 (moderately likely) if this support level doesn't hold, but resistance will be seen at $107~$109 (likely for now) OR $112~$115 (unlikely unless Apple surprises us in the holiday season.. another unlikely scenario going by market trends and analyst data). 

2. Higher memory prices will also put a dent in Apple's profit for 2017. Memory prices are already at a 2-year high and is forecast to get even worse in 2017. Apple buys majority of its memory modules from Korean companies, Samsung and SK Hynix. Analysts say that the discontinuation of the Galaxy Note 7 also increased mobile memory prices, which is ironic because it actually helps Samsung's profit margins. 

2. It is doubtful that Apple will recover sales in the upcoming holiday season. This will also hold down AAPL stock. 

3. Apple's iPhone sales in the all-important Chinese market was very weak, at -30%. This will only get worse as Chinese customers have become so loyal to their local brands, especially Huawei. 

4. While the Galaxy Note 7 was officially cancelled, Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge sales have skyrocketed ever since. This was unexpected and may help Samsung to regain market share over Apple.

5. Apple is 'trapped' in a limited smartphone industry which is highly saturated. Project Titan was scaled back/cancelled and Apple potentially lost billions of dollars in R&amp;D costs on Project Titan. Unless Apple finds a new growth engine, I think the long-term projection for AAPL stock will be $90~$100 again, as seen in June/July this year.

1. Stocks do not move solely on EPS results vs. expectations.  They move on revenue, sales mix, location mix, guidance for future results, etc.  And even if all of those things are better than market expectations a stock could still go down because the market does not price things perfectly.  Wall street estimates are just amalgamations of whatever analysts cover the company.  If the market believed analysts and priced in their view directly then stocks would immediately move to consensus price targets.  If analysts say EPS of $1, and it comes in at $0.90 - yeah it's MORE likely stock will go down on disappointment - but what if traders that move the market already assumed a worse than expected result?

2. You may or may not be aware but there's more than one stock.  AMD is not the only thing you can trade.  It's one thing when this sub gets hyped about a biotech which is a legit yolo because it could move 100x on trial results.  That's good shit, that's a fun bet.  We've now turned into a sub that just trades one stock that moves based on no things anyone has any clue about ""derrr they have a new graphics card coming out and I play video games so that will definitely translate into gainz (see #1 above)""

Why is it popular? Because it's a low share price stock?  It's not low price if you turn 50/60/100% of your portfolio into it.  

In the past month when this name has become popular it's traded up from 6.32 to 7.50.  That's 18.6%.  If you bought exactly a month again and had the fortitude to hold to today.  Which you don't.  Is that what we're into?  20% gains based on crapshoots?

3. Saving the most important for last

YOU CANNOT TRADE ON THINGS THAT HAVE ALREADY HAPPENED.  

Here's an example - don't mean to single these people out because so many do similar things but this is prime instance

Consumer Reports comes out with its new rankings moving Tesla from the top to the bottom. This happened yesterday morning and the news is broadly disseminated by no later than 1pm

https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/599luq/possible_tsla_dip_coming_tomorrow/ made this morning at 2am

https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/59awhv/short_tsla_least_reliable_car_by_cr/ made this morning at 9am

Tesla closes today down 0.2%

Stocks trade after 4:00pm and before 9:30am.  More important, they gap at open of pre-market for any news in between.  

If some news comes out that changes your long-term perspective that's fine (in this case over time people not buying Teslas because hearing they break down a lot) - but these things are hardly ever posted without suggesting immediate moves, and none of you trade long term anyway

But is this old man of the professional publishing world a good long-term bet?

# Description

* The Professional Development segment provides digital and print books, corporate learning solutions, employment talent solutions and training services, and test prep and certification. 
* In the Education segment, the Company provides print and digital content, and education solutions, including online program management services for higher education institutions and course management tools for instructors and students. 

## Recent financials 

As you'd expect the whole industry has been undergoing a transition to digital and many of the professional journals have been transitioning for a number of issues purchases to a ""time-based"" digital subscriptions. Sort of like the software industry moving to monthly subscriptions from licensing. 

The impact's left sales flat for years though margins have been under pressure. And the business has been taking restructuring charges for several years.

The other issue is currency. i.e. a strong dollar. 57% of sales are in US$, 28% in £, 8% in € and there rest elsewhere. So with sterling in free-fall there's a risk to that part of the business in the near term.

|Year-end April|2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $1.7bn | $1.8bn | $1.8bn | $1.8bn | $1.8bn|
|EPS | $2.51 | $3.01 | $2.73 | $2.43 | $3.53|
|DPS | $1.20 | $1.16 | $1.00 | $0.96 | $0.80|

Though there is one silver lining, and that's ""negative working capital"" increasing. i.e. cash for subscriptions paid in advance. It's been rising. Again, bit like a SaaS software business.

## Competition

When it comes to the competition:

&gt; The Company is in the top rank of publishers of research journals worldwide, a leading commercial research chemistry publisher; the leading professional society journal publisher; one of the leading publishers of university and college textbooks and related materials for the “hardside” disciplines, (i.e. sciences, engineering, and mathematics), and a leading publisher in its targeted Professional Development markets. 

Even so, it's hard to build a peer list and so few of these businesses are actually public. If we look at the mega businesses TR, Relx and Pearson the margins are clearly inferior. Though versus pure consumer and educational publishers, the figures are good.

So, perhaps they are stuck in the middle... and possibly lack scale.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc | $1,708M | 19% | 14%
Thomson Reuters Corp | $16,220M | 28% | 9%
Relx PLC (ADR) | $7,664M | 33% | 59%
Pearson PLC (ADR) | $5,306M | 33% | -ve
Time Inc | $3,109M | 12% | -ve
Scholastic Corp | $1,764M | 8% | 4%

## Cash / Debt?

The business does have $467M of net debt. That is 1.4x its latest operating profit. Not worryingly high and they do have the negative working capital that is a nice boost to their finances.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $62.33 for John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 21% to their target.

# Valuation

So what's the driver? We'll perhaps it's that the business is trading below the majors even though it's forecast growth is higher and cashflows are comparable.

# Dividends

John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.24 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $1.21 per share. That is a 2% growth. The forecast dividend of $1.24 compares to a forecast EPS of $2.76.

Note: they've raised dividends 23 years in a row. Nice!

# Share classes

Note there are A and B shares. So what's the difference?

&gt; Each share of the Company’s Class B Common Stock is convertible into one share of Class A Common Stock. The holders of Class A stock are entitled to elect 30% of the entire Board of Directors and the holders of Class B stock are entitled to elect the remainder. On all other matters, each share of Class A stock is entitled to one tenth of one vote and each share of Class B stock is entitled to one vote.

What I can't tell is if this differentiation is just some old throw back or if it's used by the B stockholders to their advantage. Views?

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -9% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -7%. That's against a backdrop of sales off 4% in the last 3 months.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers they continues to talk about the business transformation in a digital world, the impact of FX and a recent $120m acquisition. Nothing worrying in the call. Though it highlighted to be the value of this ""niche"" and their strong position in it.

But what it didn't give me was a reason to believe that topline growth or margin expansion is round the corner :(

I'll keep buying their books... but am not yet convinced that it's time to buy their stock. Sure, it ain't expensive, but maybe there are better places for my savings.

If I invested £4000 in this fund right now, I would get 4.54% of my original investment + growth every month, right? Then, after my 2 years I could sell my share of the fund for its new value.

I've been keeping track of my top 10 stock picks of every Wednesday (based on my particular screening method) beginning 7/6/16, making these the 17th set.

The 10 picks are beating the S&amp;P 500 index, 2.5% vs -0.8%*. My #1 picks each week are averaging 4.5%*. The 4.5%, 2.5% and -0.8% returns are equivalent to approximate annualized returns of 33%, 17% and -5%, respectively.

If the success continues I thought it would be a good idea to share the ideas and have them recorded publicly. If someone would like to check my math on that -0.8% and -5%, that would be appreciated.

JNUG : The investment seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 300% of the performance of the MVIS Global Junior Gold Miners Index. **The fund creates long positions by investing at least 80% of its assets in the securities that comprise the MVIS Global Junior Gold Miners Index and/or financial instruments that provide leveraged and unleveraged exposure to the index**. It is non-diversified. 

JDST: The investment seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 300% of the inverse (or opposite) of the performance of the MVIS Global Junior Gold Miners Index. **The fund creates short positions by investing at least 80% of its assets in: swap agreements; futures contracts; options; reverse repurchase agreements; ETFs; and other financial instruments that, in combination, provide inverse leveraged and unleveraged exposure to the index**. The index tracks the performance of micro-, small- and mid-capitalization companies in the global gold and silver mining industry, as identified by the index provider. The fund is non-diversified. 

See one thing to note is that is says “comprised” meaning it does not follow the same weight of the original index but uses the investments within it.

just for anyone unsure of [Leveraging](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/073113/leverage-what-it-and-how-it-works.asp)

you should also understand things like [this](http://www.cnbc.com/id/43974868) not everything about it but have an idea.

They're leveraging mines all over the world. The index they use to pick the mines comes from MVIS and the list of mines are here: 

http://www.mvis-indices.com/indices/hard-asset/mvis-global-junior-gold-miners/components

I think it's important to note that this stock is never leveraged directly with gold.

The whole point is, it does follow gold in a way but not exactly how people picture it.

To simplify this and explain, this is a time vs percentage change graph . I compare JNUG, UGLD(another x3 31 year long) and GLD, goes back 3 months.

http://imgur.com/0DEEKSY

TLDR/Conclussion –  JNUG does not invest in gold but because of what it's leveraged against it does follow gold trends and because of the way it invest it actually makes larger percentage swings as compared to etf's invested directly into the gold bullion even x3 leveraged ones. DD above. ",20

16-10-27,59md21,"Investing $300,000 in a diverse portfolio of at least 10 stocks (+ maybe an index)--what do you think of my ideas so far?","Full disclosure:  This is a homework assignment for an undergrad investment analysis class.  I am NOT asking ya'll to do my homework for me, but I am really interesting in creating some discussion around the ideas I have, and to shoot some more off of your brains.  Also--who's to say I won't use this expertise in the RL.  
The situation is this:  A couple has $300,000 to invest.  They are interested in saving on their taxes.  They want to eventually (at an unknown date in the future), sell their stocks and buy a second home as an investment.  They cannot currently afford to take a second mortgage.  They do not expect their salaries to change at all in the next 5 years. one big caveat: all the companies must be bay area companies.  
My analysis so far:  
A.  Since the couple wants to save on taxes, I want to primarily choose stocks that are expected to appreciate in value (obviously) and issue no dividends.  If I do choose a company that issues dividends, it had better be a good bet to increase in value substantially; the higher the dividend it issues the better the better the bet it should be.  
B.  Stocks I am looking at and why (so far)  
Salesforce (CRM): It's operating margin is positive for the first time in 5 years.  Salesforce is exiting a period of investment and is starting to see returns.  The companies income and market performance should grow significantly in the coming years. Salesforce also has great industry recognition. Now is a great time to invest in Salesforce.  
C. Alphabet (GOOG): This is a pricey stock but is expected to grow over $100 per share in the next year. Worth investing a significant (25% or more) amount of the total investment.  
other stocks I have but have not yet attempted to rationalize:  
*Varian Medical Systems
*Alexion
*Amazon
*Apple
*Oracle
*Clorox

Hello again, 

A few days ago I submitted a half-brained post about the Ethereum blockchain that I felt did a *huge disservice* to a project that many in the tech world see similarities to that of what was happening in the days of the early 90s Internet in Silicon Valley. 

Since the inception of its whitepaper, many folks have been investing there time &amp; energy into developing potential uses case for the Ethereum network - such as decentralized cloud computing, resource sharing (Transgrid),  swarm intelligence/action/organizational networks (Backfeed, Colony), oracles (Oraclize), prediction markets (Augur, Gnosis), decentralized Reddit (Akasha), decentralized IoT, Smart city backbone, decentralized Voting systems (very timely ;), even a Supercomputer (Golem) built on the blockchain, and **so so much more**.  

Since Ethereum's blockchain coding language, Solidity, is Turing-complete, we cannot fully understand the complexity and scope of use cases that will come about from all the synergy of these decentralized applications and smart contracts.  Please take a look at some of these DEVCON2 (Annual Ethereum development conference) videos and all the development going on in this blockchain 2.0 space.  

I had posted the wrong link for Devcon2 videos in that previous post as well.  My apologies. See the link above for the corrected link.

-------

I do not have a stake in EXAS at this moment, but I'm looking for an entry.

**Brief Price History**

Exact Sciences Corp is diagnostics company that focuses on non-invasive detection of colorectal cancer centered in Wisconsin. It had a 190% run from $5.48 on May 12 to $21.49 on August 12. 

Today as of writing this, it's down to $15.36 from closing at $20.13 this past Monday.

**Source Credibility**

My father is a doc who's been in the medical field for the past 35+ years, specializes in pain management and owns his own practice. While for the most part he keeps the details of his work from the family, I do know that he runs in some pretty high up medical circles. Whenever we'd go out to dinner or go golfing or go to a show or some gala in the city, he'd always go around and say hi to almost half the people there.


Wisconsin is a state that has a very prevalent, ""small town"" vibe already and the medical community is even more tightly knit. To the best of my knowledge, my father seems to have his finger on the pulse of inner workings of the field.

**Rumors**

Anyways, I was visiting home a few weeks ago and was in the study drawing charts. He walked in and after a brief chat he was about to go to bed, but after a moment of hesitation, he pulled up Exact Sciences on yahoo finance and said, ""keep an eye on this one, there's lot of talk about these guys, they had some big deal in the summer and I'd look into them if I were you"".

My father has never pitched a stock to me, in fact he often preaches that actively trading is stupid, stressful and you can never beat the market in the long run. He throws all his money in index funds and doesn't touch it.

___

Conclusion: $EXAS had a huge dip these past two days, look for a bottom. My father has never once pitched a stock to me, and I don't believe he'd point me in this direction if he didn't have good reason to do so. Do your own DD, but the rumblings within the medical community in Wisconsin seem to be favorable about this company.

16-10-27,59mvsb,Liberty Ventures Doubt - Why has it been undervalued?,"Liberty Ventures (LVNTA) is a tracking stock that I am looking at as a means to get cheaper exposure to Charter (CHTR). It is a tracking stock under Liberty Interactive Group, which falls under the Liberty Media Umbrella. 

The company's major holdings at present are Expedia (EXPE) which accounts for 40% of the company's NAV and Charter + Liberty Broadband (Class-C shares) which account for roughly 50% of the remaining. 

What I have noticed is that the company trades at a discount to its NAV and has done historically, which makes sense to me. The company is a tracking stock which doesn't really have its own assets, and also the company can be subjected to a conglomerate discount. Liberty Ventures also has a history of divestitures and spin-offs. 

However, the discount that the company trades at has widened compared to its NAV. This is something I don't understand, surely, the company should be closing in to its NAV over time. Its major holdings, CHTR (c.20%) has moved up 13% since the TWC deal went through on May 18 2016. LBRDK (c.40%) has moved up 15% in the period and EXPE (c.40%) has moved up 11%. LVNTA in the same period has moved only 9%. The discrepancy since 2014, is even more pronounced. LBRDK is interesting as its ownership is almost 100% CHTR, and it trades at a discount but has outperformed CHTR shares in the aforementioned period. 

What is it thats keeping LVNTA from recognising its potential and why is it lagging so much.

If anyone wants to look at my working out for the NAV value please let me know and I will be happy to share.

I really think this is a good investment especially following the Expedia and bodybuilding.com divestiture but I want these answers cleared before I am fully convinced to invest. ",6

16-10-26,59jcq0,Making money around the marijuana vote in November,"I remember having this idea when Colorado voted on legal weed. I was almost certain the vote would pass, while a lot of people doubted it actually passing. I had the idea of buying into some marijuana penny stocks, OTC, pink sheets, whatever you wanna call them. They are almost guaranteed to shoot up after the results of the election.

**This is not a long term investing strategy**

The plan would be to almost immediately sell everything for a nice gain. These stocks inevitably crash and I want nothing to do with them by that time.

I didn't do it, a friend of mine did. The plan worked perfectly. The vote passed, weed stocks shot up, I think he made about 20%, and sold everything. I kicked myself for not taking the risk at the time.

Now the same thing is happening in California, the vote will be this November and I am certain it will pass and send a massive wave of media and press around weed becoming legal. Any stock related to weed will inevitably pop up. Thats when I sell.

# Description

It's a big ugly conglomerate. Or should I say an impressive amazing one. The most important of these are insurance businesses conducted on both a primary basis and a reinsurance basis, a freight rail transportation business and a group of utility and energy generation and distribution businesses. Oh, and it also owns a bundle of direct stocks: over $100bn of them with American Express, Wells Fargo, IBM and Coca-Cola the most important.

And what's that all add up to?

&gt; Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries employed approximately 331,000 people world-wide at the end of 2015. Berkshire’s corporate headquarters has 25 employees.

How understated... 25 folks to run an empire of over 300,000. 

But let's dissect the earnings of BRKB a little. There are 5 core business lines.

|	Division	|	2015A	|	2014A	|	2014A	|
|	:---	|	:---:	|	:---:	|	:---:	|
|	Insurance – underwriting	|	1,162	|	1,692	|	1,995	|
|	Insurance – investment income	|	3,725	|	3,542	|	3,708	|
|	Railroad	|	4,248	|	3,869	|	3,793	|
|	Utilities and energy	|	2,132	|	1,882	|	1,470	|
|	Manufacturing, service and retailing	|	4,683	|	4,468	|	3,877	|
|	Finance and financial products	|	1,378	|	1,243	|	1,008	|
|	Investment and derivative gains/losses	|	6,725	|	3,321	|	4,337	|
|	Other	|	30	|	-145	|	-712	|
|	**Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders**	|	**24,083**	|	**19,872**	|	**19,476**	|
|		|		|		|		|
|	o/w 5 core divisions	|	17,328	|	16,696	|	15,851	|

Three of the five are ~25% of profits (Insurance / Rail / Manufacturing) and 2 are 25% combined (Utilities / Leasing).

After that the *accounting* profit of its investment portfolio yoyos about. 

## Recent financials 

Given the messy mix of businesses the actual topline and bottom line financials aren't of much insight. :( 

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $211bn | $195bn | $182bn | $162bn | $144bn|
|EPS $BRKB | $9.77 | $8.06 | $7.90 | $5.59 | $4.14|

## Competition

It would be futile to try and list the competition. So instead, let's try and pick a peer group of other conglomerates. It's probably a stretch to put JNJ and IBM down as conglomerates. Similarly UTX and HON may be too Industrial focused. Which leaves the mega GE and the not so mega Philips. 

But even with this ragbag list, the comparison isn't that helpful with margins in the middle of the bunch and returns there too.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. | $217,672M | 22% | 10%
Johnson &amp; Johnson | $71,595M | 33% | N/A
General Electric Company | $115,258M | 12% | 10%
International Business Machines Corp. | $80,207M | 21% | 78%
United Technologies Corporation | $56,319M | 16% | 13%
Honeywell International Inc. | $39,299M | 24% | 27%
Koninklijke Philips NV (ADR) | $26,582M | 11% | 3%

## Cash / Debt?

Then when we turn to the balance sheet, we see that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has $28,734M of net debt. That is 0.6x it's latest operating profit. But again, it's hard to get too worked up about this. Lots of the business is insurance, and other bits are highly cash generative, so the company could probably carry a lot more debt. 

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $240,911.67 for BRKA, i.e. $161 for BRKB and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 12% to their target.

# Valuation

Looking at valuation, the company's at the upper end on the PE and there's no dividend to hang your hat on.

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/brka/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
BRKA | $354,870M | 20x | N/A | 0% | 10%
JNJ | $313,422M | 17x | 7% | 3% | 0%
GE | $258,711M | 19x | 12% | 3% | 7%
IBM | $144,349M | 11x | 3% | 3% | 15%
UTX | $84,538M | 15x | 7% | 3% | 10%
HON | $83,399M | 17x | 9% | 2% | 9%
PHG | $28,580M | 18x | 22% | 3% | 9%

And what if we just look at an S&amp;P500 ETF like the $SPY? It's trading at 18x forecast earnings, paying a 2% divie, worth $150bn and been growing earnings at 10% per annum.

# What's the Adjusted PE?

But given BRKB owns over $100bn of direct equities, surely we need to make an adjustment?

* June 30th, they had $104bn of investments, with a cost basis of $59bn. If we apply a 20% tax on the gain, shareholders own $95bn of stock indirectly. 
* With a market value of $355bn, then the core is worth $260bn.
* i.e. 73% of the $144 share price, i.e. $105 represents the core 5 division.
* The core 5 divisions earned circa $7.03 a share in 2015, $6.77 in 2014 and $6.42 in 2013
* If we hazard a $7.25 for this year that implies a 15x for the core 5 divisions.
* And note: I think I may have missed out a trick on how to adjust for their joint control of Kraft Heinz, worth another $30bn pre-tax. i.e. 15x is probably 13.5x...

Of course, it's hard for me to **square the circle** since the current forecast for 2016 for all BRKB is $7.26 of earnings, including the investments, so... I'm left scratching my head! Especially since the first 6 months of 2016 are pretty much the same as the first 6 months of 2015. *Anyone able to explain this, please?*

# Dividends

They don't pay them... but prefer to keep the cash so they can buy new businesses. And that they did in 1H 2016, acquiring Precision Castparts Corp for $33bn. 

In the annual report they state:

&gt; Berkshire has not declared a cash dividend since 1967.

An understated bit of boasting, perhaps?

# Buybacks

They can buyback stock if they like, but it can only be at a price that is no more than a 20% premium to book value. They've not bought back any stock that I can tell, and today the price is a 40% premium to book.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 0% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -1%.

But I sort of doubt earnings forecasts short term are key at all. No doubt the market's been focusing on it's investment in Wells Fargo, but I suspect *this too shall pass*. Instead, I bet the old dog will keep coming up with the same old tricks. And each of these tricks is a ""value surprise"". Generating profit for shareholders. 

Though it seems to be impossible to guess where the every redoubtable Munger/Buffett team will pull the next rabbit from a hat!

For one, I'm tempted. Though sadly will have to be BRKB not A.

16-10-26,59jd4e,Making money around the marijuana vote in November,"I remember having this idea when Colorado voted on legal weed. I was almost certain the vote would pass, while a lot of people doubted it actually passing. I had the idea of buying into some marijuana penny stocks, OTC, pink sheets, whatever you wanna call them. They are almost guaranteed to shoot up after the results of the election.

This is not a long term investing strategy

The plan would be to almost immediately sell everything for a nice gain. These stocks inevitably crash and I want nothing to do with them by that time.

I didn't do it, a friend of mine did. The plan worked perfectly. The vote passed, weed stocks shot up, I think he made about 20%, and sold everything. I kicked myself for not taking the risk at the time.

Now the same thing is happening in California, the vote will be this November and I am certain it will pass and send a massive wave of media and press around weed becoming legal. Any stock related to weed will inevitably pop up. Thats when I sell.

What do you guys think about this? And more importantly, what are the right stocks to use for this maneuver?",7

I'd like to add some bonds to my portfolio as right now it's 100% equities. VCLT is up about 16% ytd and averaging 8% over three years. With a potential rate hike coming, how much would the price change? Or is that knowledge already priced into it? 

I'm concerned because 1. I don't know much about Baa bonds which is nearly 68% of the ETF and 2. These are 20 and 30 year bonds so they would be more affected by a Fed rate hike, no? ",3
16-10-27,59qxx2,Your flashing red light,"Go through the past week of just WSB posts.  See how much dismay there is about either drops from shit earnings or drops despite beats.

This is another (and critical) flashing red light about the future of the market.

The ""market"" is obviously just individual stocks.  The long-term giant rise in the market = long-term giant rises in many stocks.  

When good, but not great, or not good earnings come out it's investors saying ""look, there's not much left here. Results are fine but nothing special so I'm going to take my (giant number)% profits accumulated over time and be done with this""

Look at the S&amp;P chart for the last 3 months.  It's not a giant number move but bear markets don't happen in a day.  There are usually some large move days but the overall market condition takes months or even years

Usually when I post stuff like this I get some fair amount of flack so I would ask anyone that's long to name a stock in the S&amp;P that has already reported earnings and make a case for that stock to specifically move higher in the next 3 to 6 months.

And even if 10 of you offer DD on the 10 largest components of the S&amp;P and it is all 100% believable - you'll still have 80% of the index weighting to justify

My hat is tin, not steel.  Meaning it's fine to be long whatever you believe in - but if you're not shifted to cash or YOLOing the pending plunge, you're missing out",10

How do people prepare to sell? When you take a position and two years later you realise you've taken a massive hit/miss, how did you get to the point of holding for that long? Is it as simple as setting a date when you take an initial position or do people change their minds constantly? 
I don't think I can allow myself to make trades without regimented start and end dates, obviously if the stock takes a crazy nosedive it might make sense to get out, but I don't think I understand how a trader can go in and out quickly or instinctively with the uncertainty that's involved.",1

Here is an easy trade. I entered this trade yesterday before the closing bell, right before earnings. Ocwen beat earnings (albeit with a lot of one time charges).

I bought 1000 shares and sold 10 slightly ITM calls. I was looking for a lot of downside risk as this was the more likely outcome. I made 6% overnight on this trade. Not a lot, but not a lot risked either.

Here is where it gets fun... The options market is lit. I believe they are mis-pricing these options and leaving too much IV in current options. Therefore, I was unable to unwind this trade like I thought I could.

What did I do instead?

I basically doubled down by selling more slightly ITM calls and buying more stock.

I am long 2000 shares (@ $3.84) of OCN and short 10 Nov 18 $3.50 calls and 10 Nov 18 $4.00 calls. The net credit on the short position is $.55.

You can buy the stock and sell the $4.00 calls for a net debit of $3.84. This ties up capital for 16 trading days for a return of $0.16.",12

16-10-27,59oij5,Lockheed Martin,"While there is plenty of drama around whether Trump or Hillary will win the presidency and what that will mean for every industry, I think there is one industry that wins either way. DEFENSE!

Trump wants to ""Get the bad guys"" and Hillary's nickname is ""Killary."" Solid DD right there. 

I'm looking at Lockheed Martin. (LMT)

Reason: While yes they make the F-35 which is the new shit as far as fighter tech goes and they're hella expensive, I started thinking.....hella.......hell........hell? HELLFIRE!

Lockheed is the primary maker of the Hellfire missile. Most of us know from watching movies that the Hellfire missile is the primary weapon used on DRONES. If our last 8-10 years of war has taught us anything, it's that drones are here and they are only going to be used more given their ability to project lethal low cost force around the world without the risk of losing pilots. (Something very attractive to politicians.)

I think that defense is going to soar (see what I did there?) with either president and the use of drones and hellfires is going to expand along with sales of the F-35 to the US and our allies. The F-16s, F-18s, and even eventually A-10s of the world will need to be replaced due to obsolescence on the ever changing battlefield. It seems clear their intended to replacement is the ""too big to kill"" F-35. 

Also, a 2.9% dividend yield never hurt anyone.

Is this just a restriction everyone lives under, or is there some way you can trade and not have the proceeds tied up for three days?

** EDIT **

Ok, I called Fidelity and they explained what is going on.  First of all, I have been making stock trades on my retirement accounts.  Those accounts are under certain restrictions and are not eligible for 'margin trading'.  

They have restrictions about making trades with unsettled cash which I was unaware of (but I am now).

I don't really mind, I just needed to know the rules of the game.  I've been using 'stop-limit' orders to make sure I don't lose profit on a position but, sometimes, I try to re-enter my position too quickly and it violates these rules they have set up.

The bottom line, they frown on day-trading in your retirement accounts. :)

Here's their rules about it:

16-10-28,59sfdl,Has Apple gone crazy?,"People love Apple products for their finish and beauty. But the latest line of Macbooks looks completely stupid. Only USB-C ports. Which means you need converters if you have an iPhone or an Android phone. If you want to connect a monitor via Thunderbolt or HDMI, you need a converter there as well. All your existing Apple cables are meaningless as well. Only 16GB RAM is not enticing either for Software Engineers.

I am not going for iPhone7 since I love using my standard headphone jack which can be connected to my car, my headphones or speakers in the gym. I was waiting eagerly but I am not going to buy new Mac book either.

I, personally, use to love the products but I am thinking of bailing out of the Apple shares at this point. On the other hand, Microsoft has opened up better support for Software engineers with Bash on Windows. I won't be surprised that Software Engineers would be inclined to give Microsoft a chance.

Just like Intel, one of the largest customers of Windows, stayed at Win XP for a long while, my guess is that [companies with large Mac fleets](https://9to5mac.com/2013/11/27/how-google-manages-over-40000-macs-without-much-help-from-apple/) just won't upgrade anytime soon either. ",160

More concerning is the status of stability testing data from Uquifa product, given final scale up has not yet occurred. We believe 6-month stability on final commercial product is needed for a complete CMC module. Since the Uquifa site has been conducting “manufacturing activities” since 2Q14 we think CEMP may be able to submit preliminary equivalence data to FDA, a major amendment that could trigger a 3 month PDUFA delay (which could lower the chances of an outright CRL).”",1

16-10-28,59v2i2,ELI5 Why did real estate beat inflation historically? And why should it keep on doing so in the future?,"(I hope this question is appropriate for this sub. If not, my apologies.)

Real estate has been growing much faster than inflation (average returns of 8-10% and over not being uncommon). If I understand correctly, a fraction of this is from the annual yield of rents, and the rest is from appreciation of the value of real estate.

*This would seem to imply that families have been spending a progressively higher fraction of their income on housing.*

Question 1: Is my deduction correct?

Question 2: If yes, why has it been so historically?

Question 3: Again, if yes: Shouldn't there be an upper limit to the increase in value of real estate? For this, I am assuming families will not be able to spend more than 100% of their income on housing. :D",11

16-10-28,59ssdv,First WSB moment,"I recently found this sub and I fucking love it. I feel obligated to share my first WSB moment. Incoming book...


The second day of 6th grade (1996) the teacher kicked off our first project; the stock market game. 100k to invest as you see fit in three or more stocks... That's it... I knew what the stock market was before this project and I was fucking amped to play. 


That first day our task was to choose  our stocks and purchase our shares. As all the kids in class began tearing apart their news papers, I instantly knew what needed to be done. My mom watched the news every morning and by shear fucking luck I caught a glimpse of it that day. We lived just outside of Denver and the city was going batshit crazy (no exaggeration) over Tickle Me Elmo. I knew I wanted to invest everything in the company that made that soft, plushy, giggling, money making toy. 


I had no clue who manufactured Elmo but the teacher was able to point me to Tyco. We had to have a minimum of three stocks but there was no specification on how much had to be invested in each. Done deal. 98k in Tyco (TYC) and 1k  a piece in two other shit stocks that everyone else was investing in (MSFT, YHOO). If I recall correctly TYC was trading for 9.50 at the time or some where close to that. What I know for sure was I had 10k plus of Tyco shares and was seeing green.


The first couple days were ""the bomb"" and I was living it up. Every couple cents was hundreds in profits with almost no work. Now this was the 90's, we didn't have easy access to the internet and if we did we sure as shit didn't have access to any candle stick charts. Each day, I would rush to the paper to find my stock price. Then it happened... The price dropped. WTF. Tickle Me Elmo is a fucking hit. Why the fuck is the price going down? God damnit! Over the next two weeks I continued to check the news and nothing changed... The world wanted Elmo; hell the world needed Elmo! But the stock made no reflection of it, it just continued dropping a few cents here and there. 


The project went on for a couple weeks and the teacher randomly announced one day that the project was finished. It was time to calculate our total profit / loss across all our trades. The task was simple enough. I didn't make a single trade because I was holding TYC the whole damn time. 


$9.10... That number is burned into my brain forever. After calculating our totals we had to share the results with the other kids near by. The chick next to me gave me shit for buying 98k shares of a single company. After which, everyone else seemed to join in, including the teacher. I was passed off despite my arguments that it ""could  have easily gone the other way!"" and that ""Elmo is a gold mine"". It ended with the class getting a  diversification speech with me as an example. Savage.

*****

&gt; ###The presidential election's final days could present new headwinds for markets and overshadow what are typically major events — a Fed meeting and the monthly employment report.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###The Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday is expected to signal that it is close to raising rates if the economy and financial conditions are right. It could even adjust the language in its statement to point more clearly at its next meeting, in December, as the time when it would hope to raise interest rates.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###The employment report Friday, always important, is expected to show that 175,000 jobs were created in October, and that the unemployment rate was a low 4.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters. There are also dozens of earnings, including Facebook, BP and Pfizer, and other important data, such as Tuesday's auto sales and ISM manufacturing data.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###But in the last week of campaigning before the Nov. 8 election, the market could also be vulnerable to headline risk. Markets have been comfortable with the view that Democrat Hillary Clinton looks set to win the White House and that Republicans would likely hold onto the House of Representatives. That would create a status quo situation where there would continue to be gridlock. Wall Street has viewed GOP nominee Donald Trump as too unpredictable, and he has been trailing in the polls.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###Friday's revelation that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is reviewing new evidence in connection with its investigation of Clinton's email server shook markets, sending stocks lower. The emails were found during the FBI's investigation into former Rep. Anthony Weiner, husband of a senior Clinton aide. Weiner is under investigation for allegedly sending sexually explicit messages to a minor.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###""The market has gotten pretty comfortable with the thought of a December hike which de-emphasizes some of next week's Fed meeting and jobs report, but this election is now turning into a situation with the potential for Brexit-like volatility,"" said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. Brexit is used to describe the U.K. vote last June to leave the European Union, which led to a temporary market sell-off.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###Art Cashin, director of floor operations at UBS, said if Clinton wins, the investigation will be hanging over her. ""It certainly means that probably before the inauguration if the Republicans hold the House, there will be an investigation that lasts four years,"" said Cashin.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###Redler, who follows short-term technicals, said there were already some warning signs for stocks without the added election uncertainty. ""Breakouts are failing. Stocks are losing upward momentum, and the indices make it seem as if everything is fine and dandy. It's a push, pull,"" he said.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###The S&amp;P 500 closed at 2,126 Friday, a decline of 0.7 percent for the week, but also below a key support level of 2,130. The VIX, the market's fear meter, jumped 5.4 percent to 16.19 Friday, and was up more than 20 percent for the week.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: November Top Performing DJIA Month in Election Year**
&gt; November begins the “Best Six Months” for the DJIA and S&amp;P 500, and the “Best Eight Months” for NASDAQ. Small caps come into favor during November but don’t really take off until the last two weeks of the year. November is the number-three DJIA and number-two S&amp;P 500 month since 1950. Since 1971, November ranks third for NASDAQ. November is best for Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 second best since 1979.

&gt; November maintains its status among the top performing months as fourth-quarter cash inflows from institutions drive November to lead the best consecutive three-month span November-January. The month has taken hits during bear markets and November 2000, down –22.9% (undecided election and a nascent bear), was NASDAQ’s second worst month on record—only October 1987 was worse.

###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://66.media.tumblr.com/97712ebe99fa522efbadafe3e3ef8ca7/tumblr_inline_ofo8m3YX4i1spdppr_400.jpg))

&gt; November’s is a mixed bag in presidential election years. DJIA has advanced in 9 of the last 16 election years since 1952 with an average gain of 1.5%. Significant DJIA declines occurred in 2008 (-5.3%) and 2000 (-5.1%). For S&amp;P 500 November ranks second with a similar record to DJIA. NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 are not as strong ranking #8, #6 and #8 respectively. Fewer years of data (11 for NASDAQ and 9 for Russell indices) combined with sizable losses in 2000 and 2008 drag down rankings and average gains.

*****

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: Election Day: Bullish Day Before, Less So on Actual Day**
&gt; Looking back at the last sixteen presidential elections since 1950, the day before Election Day has a clear bullish bias. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have declined just three times and average gains of 0.41% and 0.33% respectively. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 are slightly weaker, but still bullish. Election Day (or the day after prior to 1980) leans bullish, but with a greater frequency of losses. Incumbent party victories are shaded in light grey.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: NASDAQ performs best on November’s First Trading Day**
&gt; Based upon data in the now available 50th Anniversary Stock Trader’s Almanac for 2017on page 86, the first trading day of November is the sixth weakest of all monthly first trading days since September 1997 based upon total DJIA point gained. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have been up 12 of the last 21 years on the first trading day of November. NASDAQ has the best record, up 15 times with an average gain of 0.37%.

I noticed there was quite a bit of earnings plays on this subreddit, and one of things I do first when evaluating potential earnings plays was to see to check:

* Does this company's stock price commonly react to earnings results and do they correlate with the beat/miss/meet earnings? IE is the earnings play an actual catalyst in stock price?

[I made a tool to completely](http://catalisted.com) automate the process, where you can plug in a company or ticker and see for each earnings report: the forecasted eps, actual eps, and the stock price reaction for each report in a complete list.

For example, try checking out [NVDA](http://catalisted.com?stock=nvda) or [Apple](http://catalisted.com?stock=aapl).

16-10-29,5a106f,A guide to Bollinger Bands written by an imbecile.,"TLDR; Turn back now, you've been warned.

OK you faqquits, I don't currently know shit but I'm going to learn. While I'm doing that, I'm going to teach you what I've learned. That's how this is going to work.

Lesson One: Bollinger Bands.

So basically this dude, John Bollinger, managed to get a trademark on the concept of mean +/- standard deviation. In case you slept through fucking grade school math, that's pretty ridiculous. Bollinger bands are the 20 day moving average plus and minus the standard deviation times two. Why twenty days? Why times two? Don't know, don't care. It doesn't even matter because you can use whatever time frames and multiples you like. The concept is that there will always be variation in the price of the stock, but when those variations are beyond a certian limit you bettered pay the fuck attention. The Bollinger Bands are that limit. 

The distance between the upper band (average+2*st_dev) and the lower band (average-2*st_dev) defines the range (or channel) in which the stock is expected to trade in the near future. Shit can happen (like $MAST not hiring enough cute asian chicks and failing their drug trial) and cause unusually large movements.  If that happens, you're either on your yach or broke.  Bollinger Bands can't help you there. They *can* help you determine if a given movement in price actually means something or if you're just a dumbass.

It has a bit of utility towards identifying trends, but there are better methods.  If the price is consistently above the 20 day moving average then the price is rising. If it's below then the price is falling. Jesus, how hard is that to understand? The sweet spot for this indicator is when the price is bouncing back and forth above and below the average. Play the field, find companies that are doing that and bank your fucking gains.

In the absence of outside influences and general trends the utility of Bollinger bands is twofold. They define a reasonable low (dip) to buy in at and a reasonable high (tip) at which to sell.  This is the autistic option. It's the one the people who actually make money doing this shit use.

Let's look at a real world example. $FLO (Flowers Foods) opened above its upper Bollinger Band on 21 October 2016. You know what happened? It went the fuck back down to within the bands. If you had bought shares on the 7th when it was near the lower band you could have sold for a nice profit. But you probably didn't because it isn't a shit bio penny stock. Fine, let's look at this sub's darling, $AMD (also not a shit bio, but fuck off with your logic and reason). From around March 2016 through the middle of August, AMD routinely breached the upper band at open (creating the bands based solely on the opening price). Each time it slid back afterward, but eventually it rose again. In mid September there was a crash, right? No. It briefly went below the lower band, but because of the previous volatility that band was pretty fucking low to begin with. You know what happened after that? It went the fuck back up. By late October it had gone above the upper band again, although that was still slightly below the highest high. So hold on to your tendies, the bands have been narrowing in the last few weeks. This is an indication that the upward trend the faggots have been shouting about for the last few months may be weakening. The good news is that during that same period I've managed to lose my shirt on the shit I'm bagholding, so overall not falling is still a win.

Basically, use Bollinger Bands when shit's trading sideways. It's how you actually make the money to lose yoloing on earnings. But what do I know? Nothing, that's what. I'm basically Jon Snow, but now I know about Bollinger Bands (C). Now go away, I'm busy learning about some random technique to shitpost about next.",41

For now, I'm going to wait a few days to see what happens. I'll definitely get back in at some point, just not sure when. I know they're really pushing for a lot of holiday sales, but they usually do that by discounting products heavily which eats into profit margins. I'll probably buy back in at a few times points over the next few months.",28

# Description

Vista Outdoor Inc. is a designer, manufacturer and marketer of consumer products in the outdoor sports and recreation markets. The Company operates through two segments: Shooting Sports and Outdoor Products. 

* It serves a range of end consumers, including outdoor enthusiasts, hunters and recreational shooters, athletes, as well as law enforcement and military professionals.
* Its Shooting Sports segment (62% of sales) designs, develops, produces and sources ammunition and firearms for the hunting and sport shooting enthusiast markets, as well as ammunition for local law enforcement, the United States Government and international markets. Its 
* Outdoor Products (38% of sales) segment product lines include archery/hunting accessories, global eyewear and sport protection, golf, hydration products, optics, shooting accessories, tactical products and water sports. 

## Recent financials 

On the face of it, growth looks good, but that's been driven by major acquisitions. For example they spent $460m in the March year end 2016 to buy CamelBak and Jimmy Styks. That aside, there's been a steady increase in margin. So seems like management's doing a reasonably job adding to its stable of brands.

|March year-end|2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $2.3bn | $2.1bn | $1.9bn | $1.2bn | $1.0bn|
|Operating margin | 12% | 9% | 13% | 9% | 3%|
|EPS | $2.35 | $1.25 | $2.09 | $1.01 | $0.17|

But where they've done well on acquisitions, the stock took a hit in the June quarter, with results failing to impress. Why? Here's the commentary from the call with analysts:

&gt; Our performance last quarter was also impacted by shooting sports consumers who shifted their spending to certain firearm platforms outside our firearms offering, primarily modern sporting rifles and handguns, and to certain ammunition products where we are currently capacity constrained, primarily 9 millimeter for handguns and 5.56 and .223 ammunition that support the major platforms in modern sporting rifles. We believe the shift in consumer share of wallet impacted sales of our optics and shooting accessories. We were also impacted by recent inventory liquidations from the outdoor retailer bankruptcies that we’ve seen and the timing of certain international orders that we have now seen slip to later in our year.

So a perfect storm. 

## Competition

When they talk about the competition in the annual report they say:

&gt; Significant competitors in the outdoor sporting market include Amer Sports, Jarden, Johnson Outdoors, and Thule Group. Significant accessories competitors include major optics companies Luxottica Group and Nikon and hydration system competitors including Bubba, Contigo, and Nalgene. Significant ammunition competitors include Remington Arms, Winchester Ammunition of Olin Corporation and various smaller manufacturers and importers, including Black Hills Ammunition, CBC Group, Fiocchi Ammunition, Hornady, PMC, Rio Ammunition and Wolf. Significant firearms competitors include Mossberg, Marlin, Ruger, Remington Arms, Smith and Wesson and Winchester.

Looking at the figures, margins are fine compared to the other Outdoors players, but nothing like that of the firearms guys. 

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Vista Outdoor Inc | $2,387M | 14% | 9%
Johnson Outdoors Inc. | $444M | 10% | 8%
Olin Corporation | $4,513M | 15% | -6%
Sturm Ruger &amp; Company Inc | $614M | 25% | 33%
Smith &amp; Wesson Holding Corp | $782M | 28% | 41%

## Cash / Debt?

Vista Outdoor Inc has $992M of net debt. That is 2.9x it's latest operating profit. I usually get edgy when it's over 3x.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $51.63 for Vista Outdoor Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 33% to their target.

# Valuation

Clearly it's not expensive though we can see it's not like this is a high PE sector. Plus there's scant dividends in sight. 

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/vsto.k/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
VSTO.K | $2,346M | 15x | 25% | 0% | 9%
JOUT.O | $360M | 22x | N/A | 0% | 9%
OLN | $3,673M | 18x | 16% | 4% | 14%
RGR | $1,117M | 15x | N/A | 2% | 12%
SWHC.O | $1,446M | 10x | 15% | 0% | 11%

# Dividends

Vista Outdoor Inc is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.02 per share which seems odd compared to a forecast EPS of $2.65. I wonder if consensus is being mis calculated. Have asked Reuters to correct. Especially since the annual says:

&gt; We have not paid, and do not currently expect to pay, dividends on our common stock. 

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -22% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -5%. So the PE ratio's come in to 15x from 18x. That's against a backdrop on sales up 20% in the last 3 months. Strange? No. The sales growth was driven by acquisitions, and the quarter actually contained a profit warning. :(

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, they gave a lot of color to the profit warning. But effectively the Shooting business is flat and the Outdoor business declined at a double digit rate, excluding acquisitions.

So you could say that confidence in management's guidance is *shot*. Either that or part of the business is in trouble. If it's a confidence think, then I'm not worried. In fact means we've got a nice buying opportunity. But if the Outdoor business is trading badly... then I don't see where the good news comes from.

16-10-28,59whmp,I need some advice on my Amazon holdings.,"So, as some of you may know, I'm balls deep in 200 shares of Amazon. Bought them for earnings, sold a call which mitigated some of the unrealized loss I have on them currently. My basis is $826.33.

I fucked up, failed to learn my lesson about position sizing, etc, etc. I went in balls deep, as I had in some of my previous trades.

Given that Amazon is a stock that's ""priced to perfection"" with a very unique valuation model, I'm wary of holding it and selling calls against it in case it might go down further. If it were something like Visa or Honeywell, I would have kept bagholding for the time being. 

I'm thinking about writing an ITM call next Monday to cash out of the majority of my shares, peace out for a few weeks, and see where everything is at. I got a long list of stocks I want to buy, some of which have been hammered (like some biotech stocks).

At least I'll have my $3,000 capital loss writeoff on my taxes... and perhaps for the next few years, should I stay out of the market.

That said, I don't need the money right now necessarily. I could keep writing calls to reduce my basis and ride it out... but I'm not sure if Amazon's the stock I want to ride on.

16-10-28,59wty3,"How To Use VIX to Make Money November 9th, 2016","Wall Street loves Hillary Clinton. Hillary has a long relationship with the heads of New York’s banks, from [being paid for speeches](http://money.cnn.com/2016/04/20/news/economy/hillary-clinton-goldman-sachs/) to [receiving millions in donations](https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cid=N00000019&amp;cycle=Career) from Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JP Morgan etc. She is also seen as the more stable candidate, largely keeping the economic policies of Obama. Perhaps this is why there has been [a strong correlation](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/06/hillary-clinton-and-donald-trump-poll-numbers-and-the-stock-market-are-joined-at-the-hip.html') between Hillary’s poll numbers, and the stock market.  The more Clinton is seen as the likely winner, the higher the market goes, with the inverse being the better Trump does, the lower the market goes.

No one ultimately knows who will win the election, and if the market will go up or down. What is more certain is that the market will experience severe **volatility** if Trump wins or is seen as a more likely winner. Volatility is measured by a measurement called the **VIX** or **Volatility/”Fear Index**”. This index tracks volatility by analyzing the premiums people pay for 30 day put options. People use put options as insurance, and they pay more for these options when there is uncertainty in the market. This results in the VIX going up as the market declines.

The VIX is currently sitting at ~16. The VIX’s average is 20, with a median of 17. This means the market is not experiencing or expecting more volatility than normal. I believe the stock market is severely under-estimating the likelihood of volatility and the possibility of a Trump Presidency.

The odds of a Clinton presidency are [currently at 80%](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/writeup/us_presidential_election_live_betting_odds.html). Her poll numbers have her winning easily. The stock market believes these polls, and has steadily risen as Clinton is seen as the more likely candidate. This reminds me too much of how much the mainstream media exaggerated Brexit polls prior to England’s surprise move to leave the European Union June 24, 2016. [The market did not expect this](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-idUSKCN0Z918E), and the VIX, spiked from 17 to 25 the day after the vote, resulting in a 68% gain for anyone buying volatility before the election. 

Do I think Donald Trump will win? Probably not. But I do think the stock market is assigning too high of a probability of a Clinton victory.  Let’s say you agree with me that we are seeing the same mainstream message play out, and you believe Trump winning is not that far-fetched.  Why not make some money off of everyone looking to cover their ass November 9th.Here’s what I plan on doing:

Download [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/) if you do not already have a low-cost brokerage somewhere. Deposit an amount of money you are comfortable using for trading. Wait until the results of the election come out Wednesday morning, November 9th. If Donald Trump is announced as the winner, or we find ourselves waiting for a more detailed count ala 2000 in Florida, **buy** the stock [TVIX](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3ATVIX&amp;ei=J6oTWIHoB4nesAH3waqYDw). TVIX is a 2x’s leveraged ETF that mimics movement in the VIX index we talked about earlier.

It is imperative that you create a **stop loss sell order** immediately after buying the stock TVIX. A stop loss will automatically sell the stock you own if it drops more than the specified amount. I usually set my stop losses so that I never lose more than 2-5% of the money I am trading with. This severely limits the risk of trading. Here is more about [setting a stop loss order on Robinhood](https://support.robinhood.com/hc/en-us/articles/208650386-Order-Types).

I like to buy 10-20 minutes after the market opens (9:40-9:50am EST). If the news is ugly (remember Trump presidency = ugly to wall street), then volatility usually increases as the West Coast wakes up, and the 24/7 news media starts putting their doom and gloom spin on everything.
  
You should **sell** before the day’s end. **NEVER HOLD ONTO TVIX MORE THAN 1 DAY**. TVIX and the VIX spikes, then quickly reverts to its mean. This means you have to **pre-identify the price where you will sell TVIX before 4:30pm EST November 9th, 2016**. This is often very difficult as your greed will take over, having you believe the stock will never go down. I start looking to sell after a 10-15% gain. Everyone’s risk tolerance is different. Just don’t let your emotions kill your trading gains. Setting limits on your downside and upside losses/gains greatly reduces your risk, and will help you keep more profits.

Please take everything I have said with a grain of salt. I am not a professional trader. I do not have my Series 7, and am not your financial advisor. Stock tips from friends, family, and strangers on the Internet can be dangerous. Do not trade with more money than you are comfortable losing.  Diversified, long term (10-20years), value investing is the way to build wealth. I do not recommend trading with more than 5-10% of your overall portfolio. 

I sent this because I am confident this trade will be successful if Trump elected. I also just really enjoy writing about the stock market. I'd like to hear you ideas on this trade. ",8

Price estimates were around $9 at that time.   So now the stock is a bit under $4 so I am thinking whether I should maybe accept my losses and sell. I am afraid they will not be able to pay dividends. But on the other hand I can sit on the stock for 10-15 years unless they go bankrupt.  btw their tangible book value is $8.14 ...  Scorpio Tankers Inc. (Scorpio Tankers) is engaged in the seaborne transportation of refined petroleum products in the international shipping markets. They have the youngest fleet from all the other similar companies.   So I guess I will not sell unless someone posts something which would change my view on the company completely. ,2

16-10-28,59x796,WTF. Why does this happen with options.,"I have been selling options a lot recently. If there is a wide spread between the bid and the ask, I will set my sale price one or two cents away from the ask price. Most of the time when I do this, there is immediately other offers matching my price. 

For example, let say that the bid is 20 x 1.21 and the ask is 30 x 1.43. If try to sell four calls at 1.42, I will see 4 x 1.42 for a split second and it will change to something like 15 x 1.42, meaning some other seller came in immediately. Since it happens so fast, I am certain that this is algorithmic trading but what's the point of getting behind my order. If they are willing to sell at that price why do they have to wait for my order?

16-10-28,59xcy7,"what, specifically, is the most direct cause of price movements in a stock?","I am interested in the dynamics of price movements in stocks. Not in an investing theory kind of way, but particularly in the mechanics of price movements. E.g. what actually happens when I transmit a limit order of xxx shares limited at $xxx price? I assume that information is transmitted over world wide web, and eventually ends up at a stock exchange. But what happens after that, I do not know. I imagine the order ends up in the computer program, and if there is an opportunity for the order to be filled, then it is filled.

But what I am very interested in learning is exactly HOW the order is filled, and what determines this. And, what effect do the thousands or millions of orders have on the price of the stock? All I think I see, in general, is that when MOST people are selling a particular security, the price goes down. And, conversely, when MOST people are buying a security, the price goes up. But, what is the mechanism? And how is it related to the Bid - Ask spread that I see when filling out an order online? I imagine that the price is being pulled and pushed by millions and millions of orders, and the force with which the orders affect the price is determined by the ""weight"", or the # of shares, of the order. E.g. if there are suddenly 1000 orders to sell a particular security, and each of these orders wants to sell 1/2 million shares, then this will have a greater downward pull on the price than say 1 order for 10 shares of the same security.

Can anybody mention a reference that explains this stuff?

Last quarter we ended our letter with a quote about Tesla. This quarter we begin with one from Dave Pell, editor of NextDraft: ‘It’s pretty amazing that we live in an age when a CEO of two public companies can give a talk about colonizing Mars and shareholders don’t see that as a warning signal,'” Einhorn wrote in a letter dated October 28.

He continued: “It’s not so amazing when one considers that those same complacent shareholders have been willing to look past years of over-promising and under-delivering from a promotional CEO. Elon Musk’s ability to spin a yarn and keep a story going seems to mesmerize his investors, blinding them to the challenges the company is facing.”

Einhorn has not publicly stated a position on Tesla.

However, he closed his second quarter letter in late July with the following quote: “’We believe Tesla’s most valuable asset may be the trust it has built with its providers of capital.’ — Adam Jonas (not one of the Jonas Brothers)”-211048929.html

Here's the link to the google spreadsheet. 

You can see the balance sheet check on cell 238. It's off by like 43.55 for yr 1 of projections.
I think its probably a misaccounting in the statement of cash flows but I'm not sure. After spending yesterday trying to diagnose ther error, I was still unable to figure out where there was an error. I made a differences column and went over the line items one by one but couldn't find a linkage problem in the cash flow statement. I was looking at EA's Statement of Stockholder's Equity and comparing it to their Statement of Cash Flows and found a discrepancy. On the SSE it records a negative stock issuance change of 49 in 2015 but records the same stock issuance as a positive 107 on the SCF. All other SSE items match the SCF. I think this mught be a result of their issue of convertible notes but am unsure.

First post so go easy please ;-)

I'm an experienced software developer with some time on my hands now and I'm looking to create a free system that will detect stock movements and then check pretty much every news source that can be checked online for news regarding this company. So that's blogs, social media, news websites etc. With the aim of getting this information to the user as quickly as possible.

At the moment I'm not sure whats the best way to detect that something might be affecting a stock, I was going to go with just the price of the stock but then I thought some news may be interpreted as good to some and bad to others so the price might not actually change much. Then I thought of checking the volume of the stock over a short interval. I saw some websites do offer this but it appears they don't show ""out of hours"" trading volume. Is that correct? If not can someone point me in the direction of one that does?

What stats would you guys recommend looking at to detect ""interest/purchases"" and where is the best place to source these stats/figures?

Any help at all would be greatly appreciated :-)

How's this for a ridiculous stat-

According to Stock Trader's Almanac: Since the Wednesday after Brexit, the S&amp;P 500 (SPX) has closed within 3% of its ATH every single day. That comes out to about 4 months or 86 consecutive trading days! Evidently we haven’t seen anything like that since the first half of 1995! At the same time, the thing that makes this streak strange is that in 1995, 34 of those 86 days made new ATHs, versus just 10 new highs during this recent streak.

Here’s another way to look at things: The S&amp;P 500 has now gone 53 straight days without a new high, yet every single day it has closed within 3% of the highs. This is the longest such streak since 1928, topping the previous record of 48 straight days in late 1993. Yowza!

In other words -- NOTHING has happened for the indices essentially since July lol.

Historically, October has been the most volatile month, but that has not held true at all in 2016. With just 1 trading day left to go in October, only one day this entire month has closed up or down 1%. You have to go back at least 10 years to find the last time October was that tame. Coming into this month, who thought that would happen? Seriously.

But wait! There's more lol ...

Did you also know that the DJIA is doing something extremely rare. For 36 consecutive trading days now it has closed above its daily 200sma, but under its daily 50sma. You have to go back at least 41 years for the last time we saw something like this.

Here’s what makes this recent action strange though: The DJIA is currently about 2.5% away from ATHs. Back in 1975, the last time this happened, it was more than 20% away from an ATH.

And this is only the 10th time since 1900 the DJIA has ever closed 36 straight days between its 50- and 200-sma's.

Taking a closer look at the 10 times the DJIA went 36 trading days or more between the 50- and 200-sma, the current streak is the closest to the ATH, with many of the other instances taking place in bear markets. In other words -- it's tough to compare now versus then, as the market is behaving much more differently.

I think we can all agree that this lack of volatility will eventually come to an end at some point and we would expect some much higher volatility before the year is out. Of course, the presidential election is the big wildcard and should there be any unexpected outcomes for either Hillary or Trump, a spike in volatility is more likely.

I've just read this on investopedia. Have you experienced any issues with IB or any other broker in this case?

&gt; Flipping 
Flipping is reselling a hot IPO stock in the first few days to earn a quick profit. This isn't easy to do, and you'll be strongly discouraged by your brokerage. The reason behind this is that companies want long-term investors who hold their stock, not traders. There are no laws that prevent flipping, but your broker may blacklist you from future offerings - or just smile less when you shake hands.

In my case, I typically try to go back 5 years and it usually takes me:

3-4 hours - entering data from SEC filings / earnings releases

1-2 hours - ensuring calculations in the Excel are correct for historical periods and the model is ready to go for putting in my assumptions

1-5 hours - reading management's discussion and analysis of SEC filings to see if there are any additional metrics included in the text or any one-time events I should be considering

3+ hours - reviewing past earnings call transcripts, looking for other metrics to include not given in filings or press releases and other questions I should be asking about the investment

All told, it typically takes me 8-20 hours to build out a solid financial model...

I'm quite new to this so this might be a beginner's question. 

I just searched for some forward P/Es and stumbled across the Russell 2000 P/E. According to the WSJ it's forward P/E (12 month) is an estimated 17.52 as compared to 90.05 of the last trailing 12 month. This gap is so huge that I cannot make sense of it. If this is even slightly correct one should put all his money in an Rüssel ETF (of course I won't do it).

Would it be better to buy PUT options or just sell and re-buy as makes sense later? etc","I'm not here to discuss Trump or whether you think he'll be good for the market. I already have an opinion on that and now it's just a question of acting.

So, it seems like Trump has a decent chance and I think that would kill the market. I want to protect myself. For non-IRA accounts, options are needed to bypass tax liability. For IRAs, there's a choice. Obviously, selling (with the idea of buying back later) is cheaper than buying options. If Trump gets elected I could sit on it. If Hillary gets elected I could just buy back with a possible loss if the market bounces up on that. If I buy options, the cost is pretty much limited to whatever the cost of the options are w/r strike price. At a glance, it seems buying options with a month expiration date will cost me thousands with a strike price next to the current price. If I'm willing to take a 10% hit (i.e. 10% lower strike price), much much much less.

**EDIT**

1)

Again, I don't give a fuck if you think Trump will be fine.  I have a different sentiment.  Don't like it? Then fucking don't bother commenting.  I'm asking for financial advice.  Just LIKE I FUCKING SAID IN MY FIRST SENTENCE WHEN I POSTED.

2)

I'm 55.  So, yeah, I have to worry about a shorter term

3)

I had this idea in 1999.  Fuck would I have been better off if I had protected myself.  At least this one has a hard date affixed to it which is nice for buying options.

I think the closest thing to this is Brexit and that's not looking particularly good.  Big talk about the Banks moving from London to the EU.  Their currency is not doing well.  At the very least, there is massive uncertainty and I assume this same for this election.

So from what I have read the changes will deal with  certain leases over a year, will now have to be listed as an liability (and an asset) on the balance sheet. 

So this could potentially alter company's financial ratios  (debt to equity) wondering if any of you financial analysts will change your outlook on companies.

For example lots of people like safe investments so they look for companies with little or no debt. The problem is companies would lease so they did not have to report any debt. With this changes the leases need to show up on the balance sheet as a liability. So many companies that reported very little debt may now have to report higher debt if they have lots of leases.

So here I am now taking notes on investopedia just trying to learn as much as i can meanwhile i am only trading blue chip. My question is what are some good resources to learn the stock market, I read the news, check out investopedia and take notes... What else is there for me to do?

Not to mention that despite her ""toughness"" on big pharma, they actually donated more to her campaign more than any other candidate that ran this year. Essentially, a *short* on biotech right now in the long run is saying that A) she will turn her back on her donors. B) She will go against her advisors and C) She will actually keep her word.

Maybe a good read for us all, even the long-term investor?

&gt; The true meaning of investment discipline is to trade only when you rationally expect that you will achieve your desired objective. Accordingly, managers must thoroughly understand why they trade. 

&gt; Because trading is a zero-sum game, good investment discipline also requires that managers understand why their counterparties trade. This book surveys the many reasons why people trade and identifies the implications of the zero-sum game for investment discipline. It also identifies the origins of liquidity and thus of transaction costs, as well as when active investment strategies are profitable. 

&gt; The book then explains how managers must measure and control transaction costs to perform well.

&gt; Electronic trading systems and electronic trading strategies now dominate trading in exchange markets throughout the world. The book identifies why speed is of such great importance to electronic traders, how they obtain it, and the trading strategies they use to exploit it. 

&gt; Finally, the book analyzes many issues associated with electronic trading that currently concern practitioners and regulators.

It has been a good month since my last extended address, and the wetness of my piss stains in my Brooks Brothers slacks has finally dried.

Gloria, our director of first impressions also known to the company as ""tits"", wore the most reveling rendition of Harley Quinn that the Japanese couldn't possibly have made more perverse. And oddly, this got me as hard as Lisa Su did last friday. 

Congratulations, my fellow closeted homosexuals, today is Halloween.

The one day out of the year when women forget feminism for attention, and men like me, can ogle their features and imagine what it's like when my RobinHood account is finally green.

Since switching to TDA, and unfollowing my ex-girlfriend on instagram, I have still been stumped why these two choices seemed correlated. Perhaps this, perhaps that, but most importantly I did both while shitting on company time.

Thus, I call upon WSB to decide what I will wear for my ragingly homosexual (but politically incorrectly known as straight) costume choice for the upcoming Ween2016 Office party. Highest voted comment decides.

16-10-31,5af09p,XIV play for the election,"With the week promising to be political email drama and insults, today was a great example of the election creating uncertainty in the market and fear associated with that uncertainty. Furthermore, the way things have been going, we should expect a few more surprises. 

I'm wondering if it makes sense to buy XIV either the Friday or Monday before Election Day, 11/8. (11/28 if you're voting for Trump) The expectation is by the day or two before the election we will have reached ""Full Retard"" as a nation and the VIX will be well over 18-20. 

Once the election is over on Wed, the VIX will drop sharply with the decrease in uncertainty. 

The big RISK in this play is a contested election. If someone demands a recount or some shit watch out!

Apologies for my second n00b question in as many days. This will be the last I promise. I've often heard people say if the news is out about a company then its already too late to profit due to insiders knowing before this information is in the public domain. 

My question is basically is this statement correct? 

For example, if the VW scandal had broke on one small news website and only seen by a few people on that one small news website before you see it, is it still too late to profit from that knowledge?

I realize this won't be a straight forward yes or no, but in general? Do insiders/people with the ""connections"" to media buy so quickly that retail traders can't profit from this sort of news even if they're on it lightning quick?

16-10-31,5aa763,Good Companies Don’t Always Make Good Stocks - today investors buying high quality companies just for their dividends - this will not end well,"I recently going through a new client’s portfolio and found it full of the likes of Coca-Cola, Kimberly-Clark and Campbell Soup — what I call (pseudo) bond substitutes. Each one is a stable and mature company. Your mother-in-law would be proud if you worked for any one of them. They have had a fabulous past; they’ve grown revenues and earnings for decades. They were in their glory days when most baby boomers were coming of age. But the days of growth are in the rearview mirror for these companies — their markets are mature, and the market share of competitors is high. They can innovate all day long, but consumers will not be drinking more fizzy liquids, wearing more diapers or eating more canned soup.

If you were to look at these companies’ financial statements, you’d be seriously underimpressed. They paint a stereotypical picture of corporate old age. Their revenues haven’t grown in years and in many cases have declined. Some of them were able to squeeze slightly higher earnings from stagnating revenue through cost-cutting, but that strategy has its limits — you can only squeeze so much water out of rocks (unless someone like 3G Capital takes the company, sells its fleet of corporate jets and starts mercilessly slashing expenses like the private equity firm did at Budweiser and Heinz). These businesses will be around ten years from now, but their profitability probably won’t be very different from its current level (not much higher, but probably not much lower either).

However, if you study the stock charts of these companies, you won’t see any signs of arthritis; not at all — you’ll have the impression that you’re looking at veritable spring chickens, as these stocks have gone vertical over the past few years. So this is what investors see — old roosters pretending to be spring chickens.

As of December 31, 2015, we provided dialysis and administrative services in the U.S. through a network of 2,251 outpatient dialysis centers in 46 states and the District of Columbia, serving a total of approximately 180,000 patients. We also provide acute inpatient dialysis services in approximately 900 hospitals and related laboratory services throughout the U.S.

* That's 180k of the estimated 470k+ patients in the US.
* 66% of these sales are paid for on US Medicare / Medicaid.
* They do have 10k patients outside the US, but that only equates to 1% of sales

Next to the HCP division: HealthCare Partners:

&gt; As of December 31, 2015, HCP had approximately 807,400 members under its care in southern California, Colorado, central and south Florida, southern Nevada, central New Mexico and central Arizona through capitation contracts with some of the nation’s leading health plans. Of these members, approximately 317,400 individuals were patients enrolled in Medicare Advantage, and the remaining approximately 490,000 individuals were managed care members whose health coverage is provided through their employer or who have individually acquired health coverage directly from a health plan or as a result of their eligibility for Medicaid benefits.

So it's an HMO, right? (Sorry, as a foreigner I don't really understand paid healthcare ;)

## Recent financials 

So the toplines done well over the last 5 years. But there's been trouble recently on the margin front. 

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $14bn | $13bn | $12bn | $8bn | $7bn|
|EPS | $1.25 | $3.33 | $2.89 | $2.74 | $2.57|

As management explained:

&gt; Dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2015 decreased by approximately $378 million as compared to 2014, which includes a settlement charge of $495 million in 2015 and a loss contingency accrual of $17 million in 2014. Excluding these items from their respective periods, dialysis and related lab services adjusted operating income for 2015 would have increased by $100 million. 

So perhaps it was a one off? Plus there was a similar set of charges to the HealthCare division in 2015.

With forecast EPS of $3.76 it does seem like Wall Street thinks the worst has past!

## Competition

The competition section is curious. As they refer to Fresenius and themselves having a combined 70%+ market share. Though Fresenius and Baxter are also equipment providers. i.e. their competitor Fresenius is also a major supplier of theirs.

On the HCP unit side it's local managed care organizations, hospitals, medical groups and individual physicians that are the competition.

And looking at the numbers they are fine on the margin side, though a little weak on the returns.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Davita Inc | $14,358M | 18% | 7%
Fresenius Medical Care AG &amp; Co. (ADR) | $17,572M | 18% | 12%
Baxter International Inc | $10,121M | 14% | N/A
Humana Inc | $54,531M | 5% | 9%
UnitedHealth Group Inc | $180,904M | 8% | 19%

## Cash / Debt?

Davita Inc has $7,423M of net debt. That is 2.9x it's latest operating profit. A little high for my liking, though I suppose this is a business with pretty stable contracts and a large part of the revenue is coming from Uncle Sam.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $74.73 for Davita Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 35% to their target.

# Valuation

Clearly, equipment / services firms like Fresenius and Baxter are at a premium to HMOs like Humana and UnitedHealth, but does DVA really deserve a discount to both groups?

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/dva/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
DVA | $11,413M | 15x | 13% | 0% | 10%
FMS | $25,005M | 21x | 11% | 1% | 9%
BAX | $25,672M | 25x | 14% | 1% | 0%
HUM | $25,499M | 18x | 14% | 1% | 6%
UNH | $133,668M | 18x | 15% | 2% | 8%

# Dividends
Davita Inc is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. Why?

&gt; We have not declared or paid cash dividends to holders of our common stock since 1994. We have no current plans to pay cash dividends and we are restricted from paying dividends under the terms of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our senior notes. 

Though they are happily spending over $500m a year buying back stock.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -28% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -5%. That's against a backdrop of sales up 9% in the last 6 months. Odd eh?

Well, on the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, they spoke of the HealthCare Partners unit:

&gt; Unfortunately, year-to-date we have financially underperformed relative to plan and we expect this gap to increase in the second half of the year.

Sadly the impact is not short-term but long term. 

So, is the bad news priced in? If the Kidney services business strong enough to carry the HMO?

In terms of the bad news, you should probably not forget the [one-off charge](http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/04/davita-will-pay-495-million-to-settle-atlanta-whistle-blower-case/) in 2015...

&gt; DaVita HealthCare Partners said Monday it will pay up to $495 million to settle a whistle-blower lawsuit accusing the Denver company of defrauding the federal Medicare program of millions of dollars. The company, which said it does not admit any wrongdoing, has now settled its third whistle-blower lawsuit since 2012, with payouts totaling nearly $1 billion.

May be this is the real reason the stock's at a discount?

I don't want to risk the money in stocks because the market is overvalued. I want a consistent and stable return. I put $100,500 into VLTCX. I get a ~4% return each year. At the end of 7 years, maybe interest rates have risen dramatically, and the value of VLTCX is now $70,000. I've made $28,140 in coupons payments but lost $30,000. Now net I am net -1,860.

Instead I find a corporate bond rated &gt;A. I buy it for $100,500. I get 2.3% each year. So at the end of seven years I have a total of $16,180.5 from coupon payments, and a principal of $100,500. Voila I have not lost any money and only gained, versus in a corporate bond fund, I could've lost part of my principal.

Please explain what I am misunderstanding. Thank you!

Hillary Clinton wants to enforce a no fly zone in Syria, which will trigger more investments in air defense technology. 

Companies like Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN), Heico Corp (HEI) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) look like excellent buying opportunities, although LMT and NOC are reaching all-time highs, so maybe RTN is the best here. 

Also people say that a Trump Presidency would lead to a stock market crash. Would it affect defense stocks too?
