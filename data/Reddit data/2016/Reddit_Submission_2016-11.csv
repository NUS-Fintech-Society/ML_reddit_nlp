So, what if, as a hail mary, they convince the fed to to do a surprise hike in November? This would send the markets in to turmoil, as only single digit probabilities are being given to it right now. Not only could this take the heat off of her, she could talk up her economic recovery policy and have all the speeches, policy drafts and everything already prepared, leaving Trump in panic mode. I mean the timing would be perfect. And didn't Bill meet with a an FOMC member recently or something sketchy?

SolarCity (SCTY) ~ her support of renewable vs. coal. Compared to Trump who has been rather pro coal, I think this company or other solar stocks could see green after the election.

Trump needs Nevada, North Carolina, Colorado, and Florida in order to win . All four of these states according to 538 show Clinton with a lead:

http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/

the obv way to play this is to probably just short UVXY with maybe a far $25 OTM protective call should trump somehow win

The VIX has been rising for the past 5 days due to undue fears of trump winning. there will be a massive crush in volatility if he loses.

Or very shortly b4 the voting, go long SVXY  bull call spread

16-11-01,5ajkfl,"Buy $RUBI before their earnings, which is after market on Wednesday 11/2","Seriously, do all the DD you want.

Their balance sheet is pristine, NO DEBT with 2:1 ratio of assets to liabilities and they have positive free cash flow for the the year.

They've dipped down from $15 all the way to ~$7.50 this year after poor guidance (beating earnings by 1000% and 600% in Q1 and Q2). Many analysts have a price target &gt;= $14.

[Here's my position](http://imgur.com/a/bLiAO). Bought the second dip this year at ~$9 and it's been a slide down since, I've averaged down the last couple of days with positions @ ~$7.60

EDIT:

This is the definition of a ""dip"" you faggots always talk about. A possible 100% upside from their current SP.

Another edit to give you some more ""DD"". [They hired Tom Kershaw during Q3 of this year](http://adage.com/article/digital/rubicon-project-poaches-google-exec-header-bidding-apps-video/306164/). If you guys don't know, Mr. Kershaw was recently director of project management at Google. He voluntarily left to join Rubicon in order to move forward with their ""header bidding strategy"", whatever the fuck that is.

The big reason they dropped 35% was the CEOs guidance in Q2 about their ""slow adoption"" of the strategy, but the presence of Tom Kershaw is reassuring in their commitment to adopt it and get it to market.

tl;dr: Read the linked article because that's pretty much what I said, word for word.

16-11-01,5akorc,The best way to invest is by investing in dividend-paying stocks.,"If you are a long-term oriented investor investing in dividend-paying stocks and then reinvesting those dividends beat all other investment approaches hands down.  History has demonstrated this.  A $1,000 invested in the S&amp;P at the start of 1950 would be worth $1,185,000 today with the dividends reinvested . . . but a mere $128,102 without the dividend.
The bottom line is dividends require the company executives to run their companies efficiently so they can have the cash flow to pay the dividend.  I suggest that you look at the Dividend Aristocrats.  These are companies  that have never missed a dividend payment in 20 or 25 years and they must also increase their dividend payment.  Long term you'll benefit from the compounding of reinvesting your dividend and you'll also maximize your total return --m total dividends paid, plu stock appreciation.  ",3

Number one is that Call of Duty this year is released this year by Infinite Ward and as an avid fan the sentiment is overall negative towards the game. Secondly increasing competition from EA. EA released two games in Titan Fall 2 and Battlefield 1 which are have been highly touted by the video game community. I believe that those games will take away sales from Call of Duty and thus negatively impact those sales. 

EA released earnings today and did not beat earnings and also gave conservative guidance. EA is currently down about 2% after hours. EA cited competition for as the reason for down guidance and I believe ATVI will do the same.   

In summary I think that ATVI will not beat earnings and will also give weak guidance, therefore I plan on selling and than buying the dip.

# Description

The Dow Chemical Company operates through five segments: Agricultural Sciences; Consumer Solutions; Infrastructure Solutions; Performance Materials &amp; Chemicals and Performance Plastics. But that's sort of irrelevant ever since they decided to have a merger of equals with DuPont.

The the merger is a little odd. As the plan is to merge the two parent companies and then, within 2 years split the merged business into 3 business lines. As they put it:

* a leading global pure-play Agriculture company with $16bn of sales and $3bn of cashflow. 
* a leading global pure-play Material Science company with $46bn of sales and $10bn of cashflow.
* a leading technology and innovation-driven Specialty Products company with $12bn of sales and $3bn of cashflow

For a [factsheet](http://www.dowdupontunlockingvalue.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Dupont-Fact-Sheet.pdf), check out the details at the [merge website](http://www.dowdupontunlockingvalue.com/).

## Recent financials 

So here's DOW's recent figures.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $49bn | $58bn | $57bn | $57bn | $60bn|
|Net income | $8bn | $4bn | $5bn | $1bn | $3bn|

And here are DD's

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $25bn | $28bn | $29bn | $28bn | $26bn|
|Net income | $2bn | $4bn | $5bn | $3bn | $4bn|

## Competition

The competitor list is the great and the good of the Chemicals and Industrials world. Clearly margins and returns are good. Though as the recent financial figures show, there's not been a lot of growth at the top line. Yes a strong dollar's been against both firms, but volumes and portfolio mix hasn't helped either.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Dow Chemical Co | $46,600M | 18% | 33%
E I Du Pont De Nemours And Co | $24,837M | 18% | 20%
BASF SE (ADR) | $65,868M | 16% | 14%
Bayer AG (ADR) | $50,798M | 23% | 18%
Monsanto Company | $13,502M | 25% | 23%
Syngenta AG (ADR) | $12,871M | 21% | 15%
Ashland Global Holdings Inc | $4,980M | 15% | 7%
Owens Corning | $5,562M | 18% | 11%
Huntsman Corporation | $9,594M | 11% | 13%
LyondellBasell Industries NV | $29,476M | 22% | 58%

## Cash / Debt?

Dow Chemical Co has $18,260M of net debt. That is 2.2x its latest operating profit. DuPont has $6,061M of net debt. That is 1.3x its latest operating profit. So nothing too striking there.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $61.17 for Dow Chemical Co and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 14% to their target. In contrast for DuPont it's a 10% upside to the target price of $75.93. Though it's a _Buy_ too. Unsurprisingly.

# Valuation

For some odd reason they aren't trading on the same PE ratio, even though the growth and yield are very close. And if we look at the peers we have to remember that's Bayer's trying to buy Monsanto which messes up their ratios.

Even still, the valuation of DOW / DD looks to be a bit higher. Though perhaps this reflects management's projection of $3bn of cost synergies. i.e. $3bn versus today's cashflow of $16bn. Cost synergies the think can be delivered within 2 years of the deal closing.

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/dow/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
DOW | $60,342M | 15x | 7% | 3% | 20%
DD | $59,802M | 21x | 8% | 2% | 7%
BASFY.PK | $81,004M | 18x | 4% | 4% | 15%
BAYRY.PK | $82,005M | 12x | 8% | 3% | 12%
MON | $44,136M | 21x | 8% | 2% | 7%
SYT | $37,069M | 24x | 1% | 3% | 8%
ASH | $6,939M | 16x | 5% | 1% | 9%
OC | $5,528M | 14x | 15% | 1% | 14%
HUN | $4,037M | 11x | 7% | 3% | 10%
LYB | $33,071M | 8x | 1% | 4% | 19%

# Dividends

No major surprises on the dividend side:

* DOW is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.87 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $1.84 per share. That is a 2% growth. The forecast dividend of $1.87 compares to a forecast EPS of $3.64.
* DD is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.63 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $1.52 per share. That is a 7% growth. The forecast dividend of $1.63 compares to a forecast EPS of $3.25.

Though we should note that they've both been happy to use excess cash to buyback stock.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the DOW's stock price has moved by 1% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 4%. DD's stock price hasn't moved compared with a 2% change in the earnings forecasts. Clearly it's steady as she goes in the underlying businesses.

Though on the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers there was one comment by DOW that didn't sound rosy:

&gt; As I've said before, regional economic trends are mixed at best. 

So, the topline isn't great. The merger may not get full approvals until Feb next year (when originally the plan was end 2016). And they may have to sell some units to get the regulatory approvals, in particular in agriculture to appease the EU regulators.

To me, it seems we are in a holding pattern. Though with that in mind, do we consider buying in today? Or are near term headwinds (uncertain growth and uncertain regulatory approval) too much? Sure there's the carrot of the $3bn of cost synergies and the division into 3 businesses... but do we wait?

## Terms

And if you do decide to invest now, does it matter whether you buy DOW or DD? Well DOW shareholders get 1 share each in the new DowDuPont ($53.81 a share) and DD shareholders get 1.282 shares in the new co. ($68.79 / 1.282 = $53.66 equivalent). So it's just a 0.3% difference.

So there doesn't seem to be any fear that the deal won't close. Though why take the risk, and just split the investment 50/50?

That's right, one dollar. It is at only half its value before the crash right now. I see no reason to believe that a small bank that was so susceptible to a crash that never fully recovered wouldn't be destroyed by another crash.

If you can get your hands on 8 puts(the volume isn't there but you can try) or even 9 puts you will take home at least say 50-100x your money. with possibility that you get 200x+.

Straight 45° Angle down.

The obvious answer is: ""Short yourself"".

But let's be honest here, psychologically how can you short yourself? It's impossible. Take my word for it. So you have to do something to *physically* change how you're trading, and kind of... **not know** you're shorting yourself.

Here's how to do it:

Sit on your left hand for like 30 minutes until its numb, then open up your robinhood app with your left hand while your eyes are closed. Your phone will *think* it's you. But it is. So then make your trades like this *while your brain doesn't realize you're actually trading*.

This way, the universe will work in your favor.

16-11-02,5an9gf,Reduce Your Risk While Increasing Your Stock Returns With,"An options strategy called Covered Call Writing is a conservative strategy designed to reduce risk and increase income when investing in stocks. Briefly stated, stock options are contracts in which you buy or sell the right to buy or sell. Although there are eight types of options contracts, we’re interested here in low-risk “Covered Call Writing.”

Here’s how it works: Say it’s August and you buy 300 shares of XYZ stock at the price of $48 per share. XYZ pays a quarterly dividend of 50 cents per share. Therefore, if the price never moves, you’ll earn 4.2% per year.

At the same time, you would participate in Covered Call Writing. To do so, you, you would “write three January 50 Calls.” This means you are selling (“writing”) the right for someone else to buy the stock from you (they “call” it away) between now and the third Friday of January at the specified price of $50. (All contracts expire the third Friday of the month.)

Each contract represents 100 shares, hence three contracts. The buyers pay you a fee (called a “premium”) of $3.5 per share, or $1,050. (The premium is based on the amount of time until expiration and the spread between the current price and the “strike price,” in this case $50. Therefore, the premium changes constantly.)

Assuming you don’t cancel, only two things can happen next: The contract will get exercised or it will expire worthless in January. Either way, you keep the $1,050. Clearly, this strategy can yield big rewards. Among the advantages are:

1. You are establishing a profitable sell price the day you buy the stock. If exercised, you are guaranteed a profit;

2. You reduce risk because premium in effect reduces the price you paid for the stock;

3. Your annual yield is boosted far above that of the dividend alone.

However, there are other considerations. For one, you are limiting your potential profits. No matter how high the stock rises, you won’t sell for more than $50. You can solve this problem by buying your option back, in effect canceling it out. You would do this if you later think the stock will dramatically rise and you don’t want to miss the gains to be made.

Also, you have not reduced the risk that your stock may drop in price. The only certainty is, should XYZ drop $25, your option will not be exercised – a small consolation. To protect yourself, you may “buy a January 45 put” giving you the right to sell your stock for $45. This is the opposite of what we’ve reviewed here, and is designed to minimize losses, rather than protect gains.

Because of the potential for price drops, you should choose a high quality, blue-chip stock that fits your budget, an which offers a stable trading range, solid fundamental, high dividends, and good growth potential.

Covered Call Writing is not a reason to own stocks, but the strategy might be of help if you already own them. Prior to opening an account, you must receive and urged to read “Characteristics and Risk of Standardized Options,” which is published by the Options Clearing Corporation in cooperation with NASD and all major U.S. stock exchanges. The booklet is available from any broker or financial advisor.

16-11-02,5aoxtv,SolarCity stock options post-merger,"Hi,

Let's assume, for simplicity, that the Tesla-Solarcity acquisition is going to happen. SolarCity shareholders are then expected to receive $25.83 in value per SolarCity share, as results from 0.11 share of Tesla per SolarCity share. (http://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-and-solarcity-agree-to-2-6-billion-merger-deal-1470050724)

The vote will happen on November 17. Let's say that Tesla's stock price is $200 at that point. This should make the price of SolarCity shares $22 if the deal goes through. Let's say I have call options with strike price 21 for December 2, 2016, which would be after the deal is finished. I do not exercise them at all. What will happen with my stock options if the company does get acquired? SolarCity's price might have not exceeded for example 20 dollars but the vote still went through and then, right when the news it out that the deal will go through, jumps to $22 (assuming Tesla price of $200 at that time). Will I be able to exercise my options? Will they go to waste? How long of a time frame is there usually before a company confirms that a merger deal goes through, and until the shares of SolarCity are actually converged into Tesla shares?

Also, I would like to know if shareholders that are present at the event, know of others what they voted for. Do shareholders who are present at the event know the outcome of the decision (whether to merge or not) the same day?

Kind regards",3

From purely a data standpoint, we should definitely be getting a raise, don't you think?

I feel like with how Hillary is currently crashing and burning and how everyone with ties to her is slowly getting taken down, the fed might pull a switch-a-roo. That could be their last saving grace to not get taken down with her, and leave them some room of deniability if questioned about their motives for not raising.

Think about the last time we heard yellen talk. She usually beats us off and tells us that the us will never raise rates again. Last time we heard from her she never hinted towards not raising rates. She basically said ""we need to look at some shit then we'll see"".

16-11-02,5apj3p,"Citi's top political analyst: Investors face political risk whoever wins in the US election","[Link](https://www.ft.com/content/75e0efb6-9f5d-11e6-891e-abe238dee8e2). I'm inclined to agree. 

&gt; So will a Clinton victory mean business as usual for America and the global order? Not so fast. Investors should brace themselves for the new form of advanced economy political risk, what ever the outcome of the US presidential election.

&gt; First, any market relief from a victory for Mrs Clinton over Donald Trump, her Republican opponent, will almost certainly be followed by the realisation that a divided Congress will mean a return to gridlock and brinkmanship over the debt ceiling with little prospect for reform.

&gt; More broadly, following the vote in the UK to leave the EU, the rise of Mr Trump and, according to a YouGov study, authoritarian populism, politics in advanced economies are having what might be termed an emerging markets moment. 

&gt; Vox populi risk, a concept I formulated in 2012 after a wave of protests, coups and the rise of non-mainstream political parties, has become a global phenomenon. ‎

[...]

&gt; Mr Trump ‎may be heading for defeat but the prevalence of low trust, identity politics and demographic divides across the developed world suggests that he will not be the last non-mainstream candidate to come close to power. This constellation of risks will be in evidence before elections next year in Germany, France and the Netherlands, and will have a significant impact on Brexit negotiations. Moreover, **a Clinton presidency is highly likely to be marked by near-continuous investigations as well as the risk of impeachment**.",10

**Question:**
What will happen to the risk premium if investors become more risk tolerant?

**Answer:**Size of risk premium if investors become more risk tolerantHigher risk tolerance means a declining risk-aversion coefficient A. For constant market return variance, this means a lower expected market risk premium. Alternatively, for a constant expected market risk premium, it implies a reduced market return variance.

What I am wondering about is the market return variance if the expected market risk premium is constant. Wouldn't the variance be increasing?",0

GCI shares are down about 50% for the year, due to a 15% decrease in print ad revenue and 35% drop in national print ads (GCI owns small-to-medium newspapers across the country, including USA Today, the largest in circulation).

Looking at GCI, here's what I find interesting:

- EV/Sales 0.4x
- EV/EBITDA 4.2x
- EV/EBIT 7x
- P/E TTM 9x
- P/E Forward 7x
- P/FCF 4.8x
- Good accruals quality quality 
- ROIC 15%-ish
- ROE 10%-ish

Now, P/B is only .85x, which means the market is expecting its ROE to almost cut in half from its current levels. Valuation-wise, even if you assign it zero growth, and reduce FCF by 30%-ish, still get a price around $14 per share, almost double from its current $7.70 a share. 

tl;dr Market is expecting GCI's ROE to be reduced by half, I think this is a lil' too pessimistic. Thoughts?",3

The general strategy being          
&gt;Short US/DM equity           
&gt;Long US treasuries        
&gt;Long hard assets: gold miners and farm land       
&gt;Long EM          

Additionally        

&gt;Short/Avoid Indexes    
&gt;Long specific stocks     
&gt;Long active management (timing and position sizing)     

There has been no movement of capital (distribution or contribution) since last month. I have switched methodology to reporting at month end.

Performance has been achieved maintaining a 35-45% position in U.S. Treasuries and Cash. Current positioning is 90%/40% long/short and 50% cash      

&gt;**Performance:** May: -2.2%, June: 12.4%, July:8.1%, August: -7.6%, September: 2.6%, October: -2.3% Since Start: 12.2% as of November 2        
&gt;**Benchmark (SPY+dividend)** May: 1.4%, June 0.6%, July 3.1%, August: -0.4%, September: -0.5%, October: -2.7% Since Start: 2.6% as of November 2               

Current 1 month performance is (2.3%), primarily driven by volatility of gold prices. I apologize for the lack of any update last month as I was getting married and had to do a lot of traveling for work as well. As a result I haven't had much time to think too deeply about allocation or new research ideas. The only changes have been a slight scaling down of the gold miner positions, a slight increase in the Nintendo position, and a shift of the u.s. treasury position into cash. 

Macroeconomic outlook: I continue to be very skeptical of sustained rate hike in the U.S. The fed will probably do a one and done in December because of market expectation. However, with the rest of the world lowering rates, there is little the fed can do against a tide of money that will wash in. The biggest risks today still centers around the banking systems of Europe, Japan and China. The French election in May will likely spark investor fear in a frexit, as the National Front Party will likely make significant headway. China's capital outflow continue to accelerate in the second half of 2016. The total bank assets for the country is at around USD35 trillion, and is growing by around USD5 trillion a year, compared to a US banking system of around USD15 trillion growing at a marginal rate. The sustainability of the system is suspect at best but it is hard to time the breaking point despite already rising defaults and troubled workouts. My guess is they have 2-3 years of reserves at best to paper over the leak of capital outflow. 

**GDX/GDXJ:** I continue to be very bullish on gold miners although I have temporarily scaled down some positions ahead of a expected fed hike in December. However a crisis emerging out of China or Europe will likely create a very strong dollar. Investors have been trained to think that a rising dollar means flat or falling gold prices, I think that negative correlation will break at some point. The supply inelasticity of gold means that a flight to safety crisis in China that is constrained by capital control could send gold much higher than the corresponding rise in dollars.  
  
**IEF:** The prospect of a rate hike in December plus a potential rise in inflation in the U.S make holding long duration bonds temporarily unattractive. I have shifted the full position to cash and will tactically re-enter the market after the election settles and there is more clarity. The cash is acting as the hedge in the portfolio against a China/European/Japanese based shock, it is also one of the most hated assets in the world. It is hated so much most of my networth is allocated to it (outside this test portfolio).

Going into election, I think a good possible area for it to settle just before election is somewhere in the grey box.

Election outcome - 

If trump wins - I think you'll see a sell off down to the 205 region.

If Hilary wins  - I think a reasonable rally from the 208.5 mid point is, to 211 to 212.50 until the end of the week.

Because of this, I think a good play is the bear call spread 213.50/214. Or the 214/214.50 NOV 11, 2016 bear call spread for 0.2 to 0.17.

Win scenario:

1) rally not big enough to move 2.3%

2) trump wins election (expected down turn).

This is going to be a live demo. I'm starting the trade today on $BUD, go ahead and set up a RemindMe in about a week so you can come back and call me autistic if this doesn't work. 

Let's take a look at the $BUD chart as of today [11/2/2016] at around 1500 EST. (http://imgur.com/a/qtqxR)

Firstly look at how far below the current SP is from the daily moving average (the horizontal cyan lines on the top chart for you cucklets out there). Not entirely important but it's not for nothing.

Now look at the second chart. It's a stochastic chart. Under 20 means oversold. Currently both the slow (purple) and fast (red) stochastic lines are under 20. This means it's super oversold. Also note how they are close to crossing, fast (red) line crossing slow (purple) line from underneath is bullish. It doing this under 20? Super bullish.

Next let's look at the third chart down. This is a MACD chart. That dark red bar that the arrow is pointing at means that momentum is shifting from down (represented by bright red bar) to up. (yay)

Those two charts show you that this stock is reversing momentum and will be entering upswing. ""But pgneal3, I need to be told exactly when to buy!"" Don't worry kids that's what the CCI is for.

The third chart down is the CCI chart, when that chart hits -100 is when you buy, and you don't sell until it is over 100. The CCI is currently at -120, so I'm not buying in just yet, I will buy in most likely tomorrow (11/3/2016) if the CCI hits -100.

This is Think or Swim. Use it, set up these charts, and look at real data instead of just what the price is doing and blindly guessing when it is going to swing.

Holy fuck I used a lot of parenthesis in this. And I'm also not going back to edit this like it's a fucking essay so don't hate.

**Live trade action below**

[11/3/16 - 0945 EST] I haven't bought yet. CCI is still at -120, too low. Down-trend might not be over.

[11/3/16 - 1549 EST] Well this is why CCI is important. All other indicators pointed to uptrend but CCI never crossed -100. Still no position.",548

16-11-02,5asgng,"Switching Aerospace to Finance &amp; Investing. Looking for some guidance and help. Thanks!","Hey all, 

I am looking for thoughts and advice about a possible career switch. I am a 27-year-old engineer who recently completed his MS in aerospace engineering. I have always known that I had no intention of being an engineer my whole life and specifically went to systems engineer as they tend to get into management and finance the quickest. In thinking about this though over the last year I arrived at the idea of why am I waiting to do this when there are opportunities that would allow me to jump straight into it. Also, the lackadaisical 8-5 isn’t me, the happiest I was working was 7-10 on twice the number of projects as the other systems engineers I got hired with and the best I did in school was when I took the most classes. 

I have been interested in trading since I was 13. My dad was an avid trader, a CPA who ran a software company working banking data storage back in the day, and I would pick the stocks I wanted to purchase and have him move around a couple hundred dollars I had saved up. After graduating college I became very interested in finance and investing as I finally had time and money to invest. 

Given my rather eclectic background I thought commodities or energy investment banking could be a good fit. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some questions I have are:

What other avenues should look at given my background, as investing is such a broad field it can be a bit difficult to find specific positions tailored to an engineer's skill set?

Should GPA, GRE, studying abroad should be on a resume, is it beneficial?

Apply as an analyst, associate, financial engineer? 

What are some possible next steps I could do to facilitate such a move?

Has anyone previously pulled this switch after getting a Masters in a non finance or business field?

Any certifications I can begin working on while I am applying to position?

Is a personal interests section something that is typically included in a resume for these sorts of positions, its seems to popup a lot when researching online and was not sure if it was actually done in practice though? 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is a brief of my education and experience(Not my resume, just wrote up highlights quickly):

So, now that Feds did not raise the rates, why are the stocks down, and why I see articles who point to this as being expected behaviour? 

Right now it seems to me that stocks just go lower whenever the feds meet, regardless of the result.

GCI shares are down about 50% for the year, due to a 15% decrease in print ad revenue and 35% drop in national print ads (GCI owns small-to-medium newspapers across the country, including USA Today, the largest in circulation).

Looking at GCI, here's what I find interesting:

- EV/Sales 0.4x
- EV/EBITDA 4.2x
- EV/EBIT 7x
- P/E TTM 9x
- P/E Forward 7x
- P/FCF 4.8x
- Good accruals quality quality 
- ROIC 15%-ish
- ROE 10%-ish

Now, P/B is only .85x, which means the market is expecting its ROE to almost cut in half from its current levels. Valuation-wise, even if you assign it zero growth, and reduce FCF by 30%-ish, still get a price around $14 per share, almost double from its current $7.70 a share. 

tl;dr Market is expecting GCI's ROE to be reduced by half, I think this is a lil' too pessimistic. Thoughts appreciated but not welcomed",2

16-11-03,5auqg1,ContraVir Pharmaceuticals(CTRV),"&gt; ContraVir $CTRV is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of targeted antiviral therapies with three candidates in the pipeline. Two of its antiviral candidates for treating hepatitis B include Phase 2a clinical candidate CMX157, a novel, highly potent analog of the successful antiviral drug tenofovir that has demonstrated the potential for low, once a day dosing compared to Viread® and decreased systemic exposure, thereby potentially reducing renal and bone side effects; and CRV431, a next generation cyclophilin inhibitor with a unique structure that increases its potency and selective index against hepatitis B virus. ContraVir’s third candidate and lead clinical drug, FV-100, is an orally available nucleoside analogue prodrug that is being developed for the treatment of herpes zoster, or shingles, which is currently in Phase 3 clinical development. In addition to direct antiviral activity, FV-100 has demonstrated the potential to reduce the incidence of debilitating shingles-associated pain known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) in a Phase 2 clinical study.


**CMX157** On [October 13th](http://ir.contravir.com/2016-10-13-CMX157-Demonstrates-99-Viral-Load-Reduction-in-Ongoing-Head-to-Head-Phase-2a-Clinical-Study-Vs-Viread-in-Hepatitis-B-Patients), ContraVir released interim data on their Phase 2a trial for CMX157 which showed a **99% reduction in HBV viral load** vs Viread(one of the leading drugs on the market by Gilead. The current CEO of ContraVir worked closely in the production of Viread). CMX157 is more potent than Viread and has shown to be safer on organs. Final data is to be released by the end of the year. 

**CRV431** which is still in pre-clinical, expected to start clinical in 2017. It is designed to work with CMX157 to completely cure Heb B, and on [September 12th](http://ir.contravir.com/2016-09-12-ContraVir-Reports-New-CRV431-Data-Highlighting-Synergistic-Activity-with-CMX157-Against-Hepatitis-B), data was released showing that it worked well with CMX157. CRV431 belonged to Ciclofilin Pharmaceuticals Inc before it was bought out by $CTRV back in May

**FV-100** is currently in Phase 3, with successful Phase 1 &amp; Phase 2. Phase 3 currently involves comparing it with Valtrex(owned by GSK) with primary enpoint being on Shingles pain reduction. Though, I'd like to point out that FV-100 has been in development since 2013 as it was originally being developed by SGYP before it was handed to CTRV when it was spun-off.

A couple of things about the CEO: James E Sapirstein used to work at Gilead, and worked in the development of Viread, so he knows the drug very well. He was also the founder and CEO of Tobira Therapeutics $TBRA which was bought out by Allergen($AGN) in September. James also has 30+ years experience in the industry, and specializes mostly in HIV/AIDS treatments. Company has plenty of cash and is actively seeking partnerships for development. 

Tell me what I'm missing here, but this legitimately sounds like it's ripe for a merger/acquisition, possibly by Gilead.

**DISCLAIMER:** I'd like to remind you that there is no buyout rumor. This is just my opinion on the company and its potential.",2

My problem however, is that I do not know how long I will be working with them. This is not a place I see myself staying too long in since it is not the field I want to make a career in and I unfortunately am too qualified for my current position.

So my question is, should I start contributing for my 401k now or wait until I am in a place that I can see myself staying long at? I am pretty good with my money and will save even if I don't take the plan, the only thing is that I would be missing out on the 5%.

16-11-03,5au2me,"Here's A Quick Method To Determine How Much Stock A Ceo Holds","Corporate officers enjoy many additional benefits over rank-and-file workers. For the uninitiated, it may be surprising to learn the amount of stock compensation they hold. Are you curious about how much stock the CEO and other officers of a key-314675_640particular company control? You can find out very easily.

This is how to uncover the amount of stock held by the officer of any publicly held company. Go to the NASDAQ web site and enter the stock ticker symbol for the company you are interested in. Click on ‘Flash Quotes’. Use the drop down box to select ‘Insider Form 4’. Scan down the list until you find the company officer’s name you are interested in. Click on that name. Go to the top of the list which should be the latest date. Move your eyes to the far right column entitled ‘holdings’. That is how many shares that officer currently holds and controls. Multiply that number by the most recent price for the company’s stock and you will arrive at a dollar figure.

Of course, that figure will change from day to day. You may be amazed at just how high that number is. Consider that this is merely the officer’s current stock holdings. It doesn’t tell you how many shares he has sold in the past; it also doesn’t tell you how many shares the company will grant him or her in the future.

When you start to look at these figures you may find them amazing. If you are currently a company CEO or officer, the numbers will not shock you because you will already be familiar with them. However, if you are currently an employee for a publicly held company you may wonder about the discrepancy between your salary and the officers’ stock holdings.

Some will say, “but the CEO and other officers worked hard for their money”. And that may very well be true. But did they really work any harder than you on a day to day basis? And if they did, does the harder work they did add up to account for the discrepancy between an average worker’s pay and a company officer’s stock holdings? Chances are, the answer is no.

This leads to some interesting realizations about how our economy works. The days of serfdom are supposed to be over, but are they really? We now have an economic feudal system. The real estate owned and tribute collected by a monarch have been replaced with stock compensation for corporate officers and owners. But the serf or worker is the one who does the work. The monarch and his court are still the ones who reap the rewards.

In private companies you probably won’t be able to find out the information that you can find on the NASDAQ web site about publicly traded companies. I think it is a good thing that the SEC or Securities and Exchange Commission requires this information to be available to the public. Of course, it is meant to be available to potential investors. But if you own stock in your company via a 401K plan, then you are an investor.
Besides the NASDAQ web site, you can also find this information on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s web site. In fact, there is a wealth of information out there to discover. In many instances it is actually easier to find on the NASDAQ web site.
Perhaps knowing the value of the stock held by company officers will make you less timid about asking for that raise you’ve been thinking about. Knowledge often equates to power.
Thanks, Willstockpicks

Sorry for the super bias political views. It sucks I know, but the market is gearing to do something and the elections could be the spark. I cant help it.

[This article](http://www.wsj.com/articles/lockheed-martin-secures-6-1-billion-f-35-contract-1478124769)caught my eye today.  Note this is a 6 B government contract on a company that has 46B revenue. BA is at 96B. Bigger. Wow. Northrop is 24 B.

Three companies had earnings last week and all showed a bit of promise. I had been following the industry a while and had BA calls last week after LMT had good earnings (3.61 11.6 B actual, 2.86 11.4 B estimate).  My calls net me .10c gain, which could have been $3, and ended up worth 1 cent each. Another story.  I will throw some charts down and reasons to follow. A lot of decisions are coming up with who wants to own what in this election season. Markets can change dramatically depending on who wins. Hillary will 'correct' the IBB more than Trump will.  Trump will help US oil and materials. The possible overreaction if Trump looks good or wins.  There could easily be a correction under Hillary too, even if you have to wait a bit longer for it. Maybe the hike does come in Dec.  The market has lots of signs of some downside. 

These three defense contractors could be win win situations.  

The case for Trump. Trump wins. Banks get mad. Banks sell stock. Market goes boom. Overreactionyaddayaddayadda. As you scour your watchlist you will want to keep an eye on these three.  He will rebuild our military.  He will contract them for other projects. Weponized walls etc, military isn't their only technology. They generate 70% of revenues from overseas according to BA 2015 AR. They can bring the money back if Trump opens the channels for it.  Who knows what they can do if they get a stockpile of cash.  Why get a yacht when you can save for a personal Boeing Mini-SpaceCraft? Auto-piloted by NVDA of course.

The case for Shill. She wins. Status quo upheld. There should be disappointment, but maybe not fear. Sectors tank, but the market might show resiliency.  She also has to bolster our military. She will want to keep reselling the plans the government buys to her Saudi pals. I am not sure if these companies grow under her or just continue along the bubble.  Pretty sure their foreign reserves will increase. Taxes on corporations will increase, strangling our beautiful babies. 

It is hard to tell what happens in the market if she wins. I am pretty sure no one knows and don't want to talk about it much. The case for Trump is a bit clearer.  If Shill wins do we continue to climb and the bleeding subsides? If so do we go to highs, regardless of bio, on strong banks? Will the climb be sustained or will it fall off after? Will the bank bait everyone and then we all wake up broke? I do not know. How long will banks and the fed pump? [he can't keep getting away with this . gif] Grandma Yellen wants the fed to buy stock now? Can it go forever?

There is also a strong case that the market goes down either way.  Both candidates have little merit and plenty of enemies. Plenty of fear. Could at least drop to summer 15' levels which were a strong support point for BR exit. We saw those levels again end of year 15' and spring 16' before finally breaching to new highs.  

Then there are the levels from the beginning of 16' (hike and oil price) which were also the levels of the fall 15' (China fucking shit up) levels.

That is all i got macro wise. 

Here are charts. Too lazy to link them separately. Just pull it up on another window. If you only have a phone and not two monitors go fuck yourself.

http://imgur.com/a/f5OPb

Boeing at the top. In Jan my pops said 'I cant believe Boeing is $100'. Good call pops. Sadly he did not want to buy a lot since that is a high price vs all the $4-$20 oils that were out there down 75%.  So maybe I buy calls instead of shares.  I will look for BA in the 100 area for some long dated calls. Maybe hold some 9 month calls OTM; a lot of cheap ones. Maybe even further out and up. LONG TERM plays. Sorry faggots.

Next LMT. Admittedly not as familiar with them, but will follow going forward.  At the lows previously mentioned in Feb it is priced around 200.  Plenty of room to grow if it touches there.  NOC is another competitor with a similar range of prices.  They all mostly do defense contracts, satellites, missiles, and basically any other high grade tech.  Note all have crazy growth starting in 2013-2014 timeline.  This is the way the future is going.  The government buys whatever and so do the other governments. 

[Even Elon wants a piece](http://money.cnn.com/2016/04/28/news/spacex-military-contract-elon-musk/)

This took so fucking long and I feel like I said nothing.  Basically defense contractors could do really well in the next 5-10 years. That matters now because if we get a good market correction we can buy, and then enjoy the present growth off the future assumptions.  Don't even try to fucking tell me Boeing wont be making the military automatic tanks and jeeps this decade.  All we need is some spending and news and it could do really well. I want to play it this way now, then I can sit on shares for life with some of the profit. 

This is the part where I say 'do your own DD' and all that stuff.  Do your own DD.  Now I say the disclaimer I think. I own nothing now but spy puts and some random bags. Keep these boys on your watchlist.  America will survive. Godspeed.

Since mid June this year I noticed Adidas has been picking up steam with its incredible new technology and footwear. It has almost taken over North America the past year and it is just getting started. The brand has been incredibly huge and I decided to make an investment based on the market and industry that they're in. I have held 60 shares of Adidas waiting for them to report quarter 3 earnings. This morning they finally reported and the numbers were absolutely phenomenal. They crushed their sales by 17% since last year which was way more than analysts expected. Pretty much they profited so much and so well that instead of analysts getting on board with the company they're now saying 'the companies sales may have peaked.' News Flash: the company is just getting fucking started. They haven't even opened up their SPEEDFACTORY in the US that produces shoes autonomously or their highly acclaimed YEEZY stores. This is going to increase sales even more than what these fucking old analysts saw this morning. 
I'm pretty beside myself now that the German stock is down 7-8% this morning. I'm holding my shares especially throughout the 4th quarter and the holidays because fuck these old people who don't understand this market.

***Parliament must vote on whether the UK can start the process of leaving the EU, the High Court has ruled. This means the government cannot trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - beginning formal exit negotiations with the EU - on its own.**** 

Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon, A 250 words long section about how an EU country might voluntarily leave the union. The wording is vague, almost as if the drafters thought it unlikely it would ever come into play. 

UK Parliament now must vote on the matter to accept or reject it article 50

&gt;Article 50:

&gt;1. Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements.

&gt;2. A Member State which decides to withdraw shall notify the European Council of its intention. In the light of the guidelines provided by the European Council, the Union shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with that State, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union. That agreement shall be negotiated in accordance with Article 218(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It shall be concluded on behalf of the Union by the Council, acting by a qualified majority, after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament.

&gt;3. The Treaties shall cease to apply to the State in question from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or, failing that, two years after the notification referred to in paragraph 2, unless the European Council, in agreement with the Member State concerned, unanimously decides to extend this period.

&gt;4. For the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3, the member of the European Council or of the Council representing the withdrawing Member State shall not participate in the discussions of the European Council or Council or in decisions concerning it. A qualified majority shall be defined in accordance with Article 238(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

&gt;5. If a State which has withdrawn from the Union asks to rejoin, its request shall be subject to the procedure referred to in Article 49.

**TL;DR** Brexit won't take place if UK parliament doesn't vote in favor of Article 50. PM may overrule can't confirm that PM will or PM's word can be also overruled. Don't know EU policies. All I know is that Canada's monopoly money has the queen of England on it.

16-11-03,5ay2z6,Brand new member enrolling in 401K for first time,"Hello all, 

I am starting a new job in medical device sales next week, and this will be my first time enrolling in a 401k plan. My company does not yet offer a match but I am still interested in enrolling for tax purposes. The plan is through American Funds, which I have no experience working with. Here are some of my personal stats if that helps:

29 years old Maryland resident 
$58k base salary plus commissions, side income earning ~$10k/year
Living with mom (not paying rent)
~$6k student loan debt ($3k @ 6.8% fixed, ~$3k @ 2.6% variable) - I've paid off over $20k in the past 8 months
Car lease through Hyundai - $315.85/month through March '19

My company is offering before-tax contributions and/or after-tax Roth contributions of up to 10% of each paycheck. There are 16 different individual funds ranging from growth funds to bond funds. There are also several different target-date funds ranging from target date 2010-2055. I've done a fair amount research in the past several months, and from what I understand a Roth seems like the best bet due to the fact that the money grows post-tax. I was originally interested in opening a Roth Ira with Vanguard and putting all of my funds in a Target Date 2055 fund (VFFVX) so that I can just set it and forget it. 

I'm not sure how the American Funds Target Date funds stack up to the Vanguard funds, so I'll have to research that. I only have a week or two to enroll in the plan and don't have much time to research all of the different variables within each individual American Funds fund available. Should I just put the max contribution to the Roth in the Target Date 2055 fund?

The Target Date 2055 Fund (AAMTX) that I'm considering has an Exp Ratio of 0.78%

Here are the 16 individual funds available, with expense ratios:

American Funds AMCAP (AMCPX) - 0.67%

American Funds EuroPacific Growth Fund® Class A (AEPGX) - 0.83%

American Funds The Growth Fund of America (AGTHX) - 0.65%

American Funds New World Fund (NEWFX) - 1.04%

American Funds SMALLCAP World Fund (SMCWX) - 1.07%

American Funds American Mutual Fund (AMRMX) - 0.58%

American Funds Capital World Growth and Income Fund (CWGIX) - 0.77%

American Funds Fundamental Invs (ANCFX) - 0.60%

American Funds Capital Income Bldr (CAIBX) - 0.65%

American Funds The Income Fund of America (AMECX) - 0.56%

American Funds American Balanced Fund (ABALX) - 0.58%

American High-Income Trust (AHITX) - 0.67%

American Funds The Bond Fund of America (ABNDX) - 0.60%

American Funds Capital World Bond Fund (CWBFX) - 0.93%

American Funds Short-Term Bond Fund of America (ASBAX) - 0.60%

American Funds Money Market Fund (AFAXX) - 0.38%


To contrast, The Vanguard Target Date 2055 Fund (VFFVX) has an Exp Ratio of 0.16%. Would it be advisable to skip out on my company's 401k plan and instead open a Roth with Vanguard and contribute the max to VFFVX? From there, notify my employer that I'd like to contribute the max (10%/check) to one of their individual funds? They told me that I need to enroll in the 401k plan within my first 14 days of employment so I don't want to skip out on the 401k (even with no match) and regret it months/years down the line.",1

16-11-03,5ay6e1,Autists theory on tomorrow evening.,"I have a theory.

Tomorrow evening the FBI is going to release a huge bombshell that will destroy Hillary Clinton.

There is currently a huge conflict of interest between the DOJ and the FBI on whether or not to go after Hillary. Once the FBI finally decides to do it, they will be facing many high level public officials and any media outlets that decide to side against them.

With the already huge backlash they are going to receive for their actions, they want to minimize the damage done as well.

They currently have a pattern of releasing important information over weekends/on fridays. They are doing this because once everything is out in the open, they don't want to also be faced with ""being the ones that caused the market to crash"".

As we have seen over the past couple weeks, any bad news for Hillary has caused some big dips in the market.

If they were to release a bombshell like they are currently believed to have, it could cause a massive panic sell off, which could avalance into hitting stop-losses, triggering algo and causing brexit 2.0. They want to release this information on Friday or over the weekend so people have time to absorb the information and adjust/prepare their positions accordingly, as to not cause an overreaction.

Thoughts?

**TL;DR**: Big news tomorrow night/over the weekend. Go all in UVXY calls or SPY puts.",6

Here comes Thanksgiving, so how about a look at players that'll get you home for the [TurDucKen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turducken) or away if you need to escape the family?

# Description

The Priceline Group Inc. is a provider of travel and restaurant reservation and related services. Their brands include:

* Booking.com
* priceline.com
* agoda.com 
* rentalcars.com
* OpenTable
* KAYAK

What I didn't realise was how important ""international"" is to them. And specifically Booking.com

&gt; During the year ended December 31, 2015, our international business (the substantial majority of which is generated by Booking.com) represented approximately 88% of our gross bookings (an operating and statistical metric referring to the total dollar value, generally inclusive of all taxes and fees, of all travel services booked by our customers, net of cancellations), approximately 86% of our consolidated gross profit and approximately 94% of our consolidated operating income. A significant majority of our gross profit is earned in connection with facilitating accommodation reservations. 

And how do they make money? Primarily from commissions &amp; advertising. 

## Recent financials 

So sales and earnings have more than doubled in 5 years. Wow.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $9.2bn | $8.4bn | $6.8bn | $5.3bn | $4.4bn|
|EPS | $49.45 | $45.67 | $36.11 | $27.66 | $20.63|

Though it isn't all pretty. As looking at the 10% growth overall in 2015, International grew 12% to $49bn of gross bookings and the US declined 2% to $7bn of gross bookings.

## Competition


When it comes to the competition, here's who they highlight

&gt; Some of our current and potential competitors, such as Google, Apple, Alibaba, Amazon and Facebook, have access to significantly greater and more diversified resources than we do, and they may be able to leverage other aspects of their businesses (e.g., search or mobile device businesses) to enable them to compete more effectively with us.

Is it odd that AirBnB isn't on the list?

Unsurprisingly, Google get's a special mention... yes, Google who's now aggressively pushing Google Flights!

&gt; For example, Google has entered various aspects of the online travel market through its acquisition in 2011 of ITA Software, Inc., a major flight information software company, its hotel search and reservation booking business (""Book on Google"") and its license of hotel-booking software from Room 77.

Remember that Google as part of the [acquisition agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITA_Software) had to license ITA software to other websites for five years. Ooops... times up, gloves off.

Looking at the data, margins and returns are just *peachy*! No wonder Google's after this market. 

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Priceline Group Inc | $9,807M | 38% | 30%
Expedia Inc | $8,379M | 15% | 6%
Ctrip.Com International Ltd (ADR) | $2,168M | -ve | 1%
Travelport Worldwide Ltd | $2,310M | 23% | N/A
Tripadvisor Inc | $1,467M | 17% | 10%

## Cash / Debt?

Priceline Group Inc has $2,885M of net debt. That is 0.8x its latest operating profit. So nothing to worry about there.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $1585.25 for Priceline Group Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 10% to their target.

# Valuation

It's hard not to like 21x forecast earnings. The business looks like it's growth nicely, isn't hurt by the competition internationally. 

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/pcln.o/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
PCLN.O | $71,438M | 21x | 17% | 0% | 4%
EXPE.O | $18,454M | 26x | 26% | 1% | 6%
CTRP.O | $21,070M | -ve | 0% | 0% | 0%
TVPT.K | $1,749M | 12x | 15% | 2% | 10%
TRIP.O | $8,977M | 39x | 8% | 0% | 3%

# Dividends

Priceline Group Inc is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. And they aren't planning to pay one any time soon. 

Instead they prefer repurchasing stock and have a $3bn program in place.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 6% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 2%. That's against a backdrop of sales up 14% in the first 6 months and net income up 12%.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers in August they displayed a lot of confidence in the 3rd quarter and long-term. Sure there will be a deceleration as they get bigger, but they feel well placed. Plus they are seeing good progress on their investment in mobile. Next results are 7th Nov... so not far off!

Clearly management's doing something right! I still can't quite see the competitive advantage of Booking.com but it exists, and the onslaught of major internet brands hasn't hurt it. 

Oddly, my biggest bearbug is a technical... it's stock price. At $1,500 a share it's clearly not a stock for everyone, unless you have a broker that does fractional shares. In fact the only large cap stock with a bigger price is Buffett's at $215,000 per BRKA. But there's Baby Buffett too BRKB. 

Am tempted...though need to get my head round the defensibility. Do they have a *moat*? What do you think?

Those of us in the tech industry know that this is a great merger and will strengthen both companies in the intermediate term.  From an investment perspective, it appears CTL is getting a great benefit in the form of a $10B carried loss that LVLT has (from past fiber installs).  Considering they have about $380M in deferred income tax and another ~100M per quarter in ongoing tax, this carried loss will increase the cash flow of CTL by almost 40% per quarter.  This makes the dividend--as it is--safe, and it may possibly go higher.. at the 23.10 price, CTL is yielding 9.3%! 

LVLT has a previous relationship with Berkshire Hathaway and I wouldn't be surprised to see CTL as a small utility play for them at these prices.",0

16-11-03,5aymfr,DISCUSSION: Adidas Earnings,"Hey Everyone so I am a beginner investor and have allocated a good portion of my portfolio to the Company Adidas.  (ADDYY OTC)

This morning before market open, Adidas has reported their earnings and I am a bit thrown off since the stock has plummeted a little.  They have increased sales by 17% since the past year and their profits are up some 24%.  Analysts say they think the sales have peaked right now and that is the sole reason why the stock has dropped 8-9% today.  I cannot figure out why these analysts think this.  The only thing that the new CEO of the company has stated that needs to be revamped is the REEBOK Line that they have even though sales for the subsidiary have grown 7%.  

The company again reported stellar results with sales and profitability i.e. EPS.  What gives with the drop?  What warrants these 'analysts' to say the sales have peaked?  

Adidas has not even begun producing autonomous shoes from the new SPEEDFACTORY in Atlanta Georgia and have not even opened up their new coveted YEEZY Stores that fans will be waiting across the globe for.  Why are these analysts treating the company the way it is?  Nike and Under Armour have been falling off in North America and Adidas has grown tremendously in the area.  Why don't analysts realize this?

EDIT: In trading on Thursday, shares of Adidas AG (OTC: ADDYY) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 25.1, after changing hands as low as $75.62 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) is 36.4. A bullish investor could look at ADDYY’s 25.1 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of ADDYY shares:",5

16-11-03,5axs19,"Experts Puzzled, Vaccine Manufacturers Thrilled By “Aspiring Autist” Movement","***The Wall Street Bets Weekly Herald***

**Experts Puzzled, Vaccine Manufacturers Thrilled By “Aspiring Autist” Movement**

Social anxiety, obsessive compulsions, derision by peers, and a taste for chicken tenders - these are but a few of the traits which a shocking number of burgeoning stock traders now strive to achieve.  

Dubbed “Aspiring Autists” by Sarah Helmholtz, an economics professor at the University of Texas McCombs School of Business, the movement has grown rapidly among undergraduates pursuing degrees in finance.  “My colleagues across the nation have all seen it. UPenn, Harvard, NYU, UC Berkley, everyone’s noticed that the kids are spouting this anti-social rhetoric.  I almost feel bad for them, they’re destroying their reputations, but then they bust out their lunches during lecture and I lose all respect.  Tendies, they call them.  Tendies!” 

Helmholtz then shook her head.  “Fucking millennials.”

Some have theorized that the trend is inspired by a widespread - and drastically incorrect - misconception that autism makes one smarter.  However, a foolhardy attempt at boosting intelligence might not be the only factor.  Millennials interested in finance have largely chosen “Pharmabro” u/martinshkreli as their “Lord and savior”, according to sources born after 1992.  With vast speculation placing the young entrepreneur on the high end of the autism spectrum, admirers might simply be seeking to emulate his every move.  

Reasons aside, no one can deny that the youths are trying their hardest to acquire the disorder.  To the confusion of healthcare professionals everywhere, vaccinations among the 18-24 demographic have risen significantly in 2016.  As a New York City pharmacist explained, “We’ve got kids coming in on a weekly basis, asking for double doses of this year’s flu shot.  It makes no sense.  Sales are through the roof at least, so there’s that.”

His sentiments echoed among executives in the pharmaceutical industry.  A vice president at flu-shot manufacturer Sanofi Pasteur admitted “Look, I know we’ve said before that vaccines don’t cause autism, and we’re not saying they do - [pauses] - just, you know, we’re not exactly advertising those facts.  Might as well give the consumers what they want!”

In any case, the trend is likely to die down once financial internship interviews begin in earnest for the summer of 2017.  As fund manager Davis Christiansen put it:

“If you’re literally trying to act retarded, it’s too late.  Give up trading - it’ll be HR for you.”

20 YO Particularly new investor
I had just twoo days ago purchased 66,640.0000 shares of MJNA for .16 a share after surcharge.

yesterday i was bewildered to see a 46% increase when  i checked my portfolio in the evening. i got on at about 9:30am kansas city time and saw it had shot up another .02 cents for a total of 00.27 a share. by the time i decided to go ahead and put in an order to sell all shares at.2450 i watched the quote refresh and the stock had plummeted already.

my question is, did someone just pump and dump this stock and i screwed myself by not setting a stop loss limit? basically lost over $5000 profit

also going long on 500 shares of CBDS bought at 5.95

and any insight about cannastocks would be greatly appreciated as i am a 20 year old with 20k at the dispose and would like to invest wisely",3

It is true that the ski industry is a very tough one to get into: you need a lot of up front capital to even get started (lifts, increasingly you need snowmaking ability). Vail is quite established, and the high barriers to entry mean that it's difficult for new players to get into the industry. My prediction is that Vail will continue buying up resorts until it becomes a sort of ""Marriot"": One overarching brand with a lot of sub brands that cater to various interests/price levels. Of course, there is the issue of global warming disrupting the industry, but I would say that Vail, since it's so big, has the best chance of surviving climate change and may actually benefit since it will be able to buy competitors out.

16-11-04,5b19js,A Traders Edge In The Stock Market,"Unless you are able to develop a considerable trading edge over the other traders, you will end up losing your money, even if you are disciplined and organized. In this article, I discuss some elements that I use in my trading edge.

Fundamental Analysis

Fundamental analysis is the process of evaluating the financial condition of a company using financial reports, price/earning ratios, revenues, market share, sales and growth, etc. This type of analysis can be time consuming so instead of going through pages of financial reports, I simply look at IBD ratings.

I like to use Investor’s Business Daily (IBD found at investors.com) to get a quick overview of a stock. The IBD rating covers:

1 – Earnings Per Share (EPS) rating: tells me a stock’s average short term (recent quarters) and long term (last three years) earning growth rate. The number I see is how the company compares to all other companies. The scale runs from 1 to 99, 99 being the best.

2 – Relative Price Strength (RS) Rating: Measures a stock’s relative price change in the last 12 months in comparison to all other equities. The scale runs from 1 to 99, 99 being the best.

3 – Industry Relative Price Rating: Compares a stock’s industry price action in the last 6 months to the other 196 industries in IBD’s industry list. The scale is from A to E, A being the best.

4 – Sales + Profit Margins + ROE (Return on Equity) Rating: Crunches a firm’s sales growth rate during the last 3 quarters, before and after profit margins and return on equity into one letter. The scale is from A to E, A being the best.

5 – Accumulation/Distribution rating: Applies a formula of price and volume changes in the last 13 weeks to determine if it is being accumulated or distributed. A = heavy buying, C = Neutral, E = heavy selling.

If you like the idea of including fundamental analysis into your trading plan, consider trading only stocks that meet some minimum requirements – for example A or B, &gt; 70, etc.

I like to use fundamental ratings for longer term trades such as the ones I plan on weekly charts. It is not really useful if you trade intraday.
Technical Analysis

Fundamental analysis is great to build a list of strong stocks, or as a way to filter out weak stocks, but that’s about it. It does not provide you with an objective method to enter and exit trades. All my trading decisions (entry, exit, and stops) are based on technical analysis.

Technical analysis is the study of prices. The price action draws patterns on charts and because human behavior can be repetitive, the price patterns can also be repetitive.

You can choose from a variety of chart types. The Japanese candlestick charts are by far the best and it is the only form you need. There are entire books dedicated to the study of candlestick patterns – if you are serious about studying candlestick charts, look at books written by Steve Nison and and Gregory L. Morris.

– Support and Resistance: The most important concept in technical analysis is Support and Resistance. It forms the foundation for every trading decision and could cover many pages but I will limit myself to simplified definitions and a couple examples:

Support level: A price level that a declining market or stock failed to penetrate
Example: the low of the previous day forms an area of support and is often used as a stop loss.

Resistance level: A price level that a rising market or stock failed to break through
Example: a prior high in an uptrend forms an area of resistance and can be used as a minimum objective to take some profits.

Some technical indicators may also provide some support and resistance, for example moving averages, in part maybe because so many traders expect it.

– Oscillators

An oscillator is a technical indicator that tells you at a glance whether a market or a stock currently trades in an “overbought” or “oversold” condition. Some traders use oscillators to forecast a change of direction. Some examples include the RSI, Stochastic Oscillator, and MACD.

There are hundreds of oscillators and technical indicators. I personally look at them to filter out some stocks if I have too many good ones to choose from. I never use them as a signal to open or close a trade.

– Public Sentiment

I look for support and resistance on the VIX (Volatility Index) daily chart to anticipate reversals.

I look at the Put/Call Ratio (5 MA and 10 MA) on the daily chart to see if traders are too bearish (MAs &gt; 0.8) or too bullish (MAs &lt; 0.5).

(MA = Moving Average)

– Market internals to see if the market is overbought or oversold

I look at the TRIN (5 MA and 10 MA) on the daily chart – overbought (MAs &lt; 0.8) or oversold (MAs &gt; 1.2).

I look at the McClellan Oscillator – the market is overbought if it rises above +70 and oversold if drops below -70. A buy signal is generated if it falls into the oversold area (-70 to -100) and then turns up – a sell signal is generated if it rises into the overbought area (+70 to +100) and then turns down. If it goes beyond the -100/+100 levels then it may be a sign of continuation of the current trend.

– Market and Industries

I like to buy stocks from industries in a strong uptrend and short stocks from industries in a downtrend. I also consider the direction of the industry for the day (positive or negative).
Putting it all together

This article is not about teaching you how to develop an edge but hopefully it shows you that there are many different tools that can be used to improve your odds. It takes time to find a combination that fits your personality. It takes time to find what works for you.

For starters [the 200 day moving average is starting to cross the 50 day moving average](http://i.imgur.com/y4CC6NH.jpg) You can also see that the RSI is losing momentum. Along with that the new high did not match previous highs when reaching the line of resistance.

Not only are there a lot of bearish indicators but notable people within the company have sold shares.[Including their CEO](http://reviewfortune.com/2016/11/01/which-way-nvidia-corporation-nasdaqnvda-insiders-are-heading-5/)

Now I love NVDA they have been absolutely wonderful. What has me conflicted is many analyst still rate NVDA as a buy or hold. Only Wells Fargo rates it as a sell but who can trust those mother fuckers anymore?

Along with that I can't tell if the decline it has faced this past week is just the markets reaction to the upcoming election. To be fair the whole market last week has be relatively down.

I'm up like 90% roi on nvda and if I've learned anything from you nut cases it's to get out when your all buttered up.

16-11-04,5b4r6y,The US Dollar and China,"The USD is currently very strong. We are still an import &gt; exports country with most of our imports coming from Asia and South America. 

Given the current situation in China where the prices of things are getting more and more expensive (because the gov is artificially depressing the value of the RMB) and people can't even afford the new homes being built in most large cities, it seems that they will have to relieve this pressure in the near future and increase the value of the RMB. 

Given such a large trade deficit between our 2 countries, this will cause a relative devaluation of the USD. The US will have to pay more for Chinese goods and services while China will increase investments in the US (i.e. Buying up properties and businesses - which can already be seen with their recent large purchases such as the Waldorf Astoria and large tracts of land in Flushing, NY and other investments in California) Of course, the massive debt we owe China will also be devaluated which would be bad for the Chinese.

To make this more relevant to r/investing, what do you think this will do to Chinese markets as they pertain to US investors, specifically China ETFs or emerging markets with large holdings in China such as VWO.

On the one hand, a valuable US dollar and cheap RMB is good for the Chinese economy, but with things going the way they are, the RMB has to increase in value for the country economy to avoid insane levels of inflation. So would this then translate into a slowing of the economy and a drop in the price of these aforementioned funds?

Would love to hear everyone's 2 cents.

To protect yourself against loss, sell an OTM Call Spread. This is similar to selling a covered call, except that you don't have to risk triggering a taxable event. Slightly less protection that buying a put, but you can actually get paid a premium to protect yourself. 

If SPY Is trading at 209, you might buy a sell a 214 call for 50 cents or so and buy a 216. Your total risk is 200 bucks a spread and you could make 30-40 depending on the Vix and where you put your strikes. I'm pulling these prices out of thin air, but the math checks out. If you're wrong and spy hits your strike price, you gain in your stock but lose on the spread, up to 200 bucks pre spread or wherever you set your strikes. If you're right, the spy drops, you collect a premium, and you're still sitting on a paper loss, but you got a little premium just for waiting.",0

It's [10 months](https://www.reddit.com/r/stockaday/comments/3x8flw/mck_how_well_is_mckesson_delivering/) since we looked at MCK and the stock's lost $60 :( We didn't like the way it reported earnings back then, but didn't come out strong for or against it. Has it all changed?

# Description
McKesson Corporation is engaged in delivering pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and healthcare information technology. The Company operates through two segments: 

* The McKesson Distribution Solutions segment distributes drugs and equipment, and health and beauty care products across North America and internationally. The Distribution Solutions segment provides pharmaceutical solutions for biotech and pharmaceutical manufacturers, and practice management, technology, clinical support and business solutions to oncology and other specialty practices operating in the community setting. 
* The Technology Solutions segment delivers clinical, patient care, financial, supply chain and strategic management software solutions, as well as connectivity, outsourcing and other services. 

## Recent financials 

The last 5 years have been remarkable with earnings nearly doubling and sales up 50%.

|March year-end|2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $191bn | $179bn | $137bn | $122bn | $122bn|
|EPS | $9.70 | $6.27 | $5.41 | $5.59 | $5.60|

And in the same time frame they've busily repurchasing shares and driving up their return on equity.

Though on think to more is the relative importance of the two business lines. The Distribution business is $188bn in sales and the growing high single digit. The Technology unit is $3bn of sales and flat at best. Looking at cashflow, the Distribution unit generates $3.6bn of operating profit, and technology 0.5bn. Though there is also a crazy large ""corporate expense"" that's been running at $400 to 500m a year. Bizarre!

## Competition

Well we need to look at the two divisions. First Distribution.

&gt; Our Distribution Solutions segment faces a highly competitive global environment with strong competition from international, national, regional and local full-line, short-line and specialty distributors, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chain drug stores, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies and large payer organizations. 

Then Technology

&gt; Our Technology Solutions segment experiences substantial competition from many companies, including other software services firms, consulting firms, shared service vendors, certain hospitals and hospital groups, payers, care management organizations, hardware vendors and internet-based companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry.

Though frankly, looking at the performance and cashflow of the Tech division it seems to be irrelevant to the overall picture.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
McKesson Corporation | $194,267M | 2% | 22%
Cardinal Health Inc | $125,530M | 2% | 21%
Express Scripts Holding Co | $101,600M | 7% | 17%
AmerisourceBergen Corp. | $146,850M | 1% | 104%
Owens &amp; Minor, Inc. | $9,843M | 3% | 11%

## Cash / Debt?

McKesson Corporation has $2,643M of net debt. That is 0.6x it's latest operating profit.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $156.36 for McKesson Corporation and their recommendation to clients is _Hold_. That implies an upside of 21% to their target.

Let's compare that to 10 months ago...

&gt; The average recommendation from Wall Street analysts is a Buy with a target price of $230 which is a 21% upside to the current price of $191

Surprise! 21% upside again. Wall Street showering itself in glory there.

# Valuation

On the valuation side they've gone from 15x forecast earnings 10 months ago with an expected 14% growth rate to 10x and 9%. Though it's hard to say that anyone else in the peer groups performed much better.

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/mck/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
MCK | $29,299M | 10x | 9% | 1% | 9%
CAH | $20,919M | 12x | 11% | 2% | 12%
ESRX.O | $41,462M | 11x | 13% | 0% | 11%
ABC | $17,204M | 13x | 9% | 2% | 12%
OMI | $2,001M | 16x | 3% | 3% | 12%

At these prices, it's almost tempting, as long as we believe in the cashflow of the core Distribution business.

But again, like last time, I'm a little troubled by the $12.53. Looks like an ""adjusted figure"". Though the current price of $130 is only 13x historic reported earnings.

# Dividends

McKesson Corporation is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.12 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $1.12 per share. That is a 0% growth. The forecast dividend of $1.12 compares to a forecast EPS of $12.53.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -33% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -8%. That's against a backdrop of sales up 4% in the last 6 months.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, they profit warned, pulled in guidance for the year and talked about issues in the tech business. So it was gloom all round.

Now it's only 10 days since the disaster, but the price is beginning to stabilize. So...maybe just maybe the hot money's gone. 

But my gut feel is we've another quarter for the issues on both divisions to come through. I'm not yet convinced on the core cashflows of the distribution unit. Though at 13x historic earnings, maybe I'm not paying for conviction.

16-11-04,5b719f,Sell my houses and buy apartment complexes?,"I make most of my money from appreciation currently, though I have a healthy amount of cash flow as well (about 50K, west coast properties in a major city where you make your money from appreciation while it's good).

But to really scale and as the market cools down, not only scale to bigger deals but deals that make me money primarily from cash flow. I am considering selling each of my houses (10-31 exchange) and using the equity in each as a 25% down payment on a series of 20 unit apartment complexes. Even with a mortgage, property management, etc. each should cash flow about 40K a year crunching the numbers on the ones I've looked at. I'm estimating about 160K a year cash flow, using a property manager for all of it.

My only hesitations are 1) no experience in MF investing though I've been learning for months how they work and what to look for, how to screen deals, etc. 2) Risk, my houses are much more liquid as consumers want to buy them. Apartment complexes are investor only really...3) The risk of lawsuits increases with each additional tenant you have. While my property manager would deal with day to day stuff, I still have to deal with major items like capital expenditures, law suits, etc. In another word, STRESS!!

I could retire with my current plan with 2 million in a few years. But I want to make that 2 million into 4, 6, etc. By doing bigger and better deals. I've been doing this with single family homes, owning one house that costs as much as a 20 unit apartment complex in Tampa...

16-11-05,5b96ym,Colorblind Portfolio Manager Question,"Hey guys. I had a quick question. I kind of stumbled into the position of where I am today and I need a bit of help. So, I am colorblind. This presents a problem in the world of finance that I have been trying to get around and I think that avoidance has come to a crossroads. Some of, actually most of, no, I'll be honest, all of, my investors are mad at me. I think I made some bad decisions with their money but I can't tell, because of being colorblind. Up until this point, I got along by using facial expressions. If my clients came to talk to me with smiley faces I would write quarterly letters that were positive and the opposite if they had frowny faces. This is how I knew how the economy was doing, based on my smiley/frowny ratio. Anyway, please find attached my portfolio and please let me know in the comments by selecting a smiley face or frowny face what my clients money is doing. I can't tell how to write my quarterly letter because my clients won't talk to me anymore but also haven't withdrawn their money, so my smiley to frowny ratio isn't working like it normally does. 
Thanks. I really appreciate your help.

16-11-05,5b9b25,Are we naive to expect historical returns from indexing?,"What indicators in the future do you see that could continue the huge 7% annual growth rate of the world economy?

So far as I see it there is population growth, which means more consumers. And there is globalisation, which means brands establishing themselves world wide.

In a bit further future I see Google coming out with AI helper of some sort that will be a very demanded product, but it should be priced in the market right now anyway and even if they do come out with something like that it will probably just replace the smartphone or come along with a smartphone app like an extremely intelligent Google Assistant.

What else? Well, we can have Mars colonisation. That might grow economy...a little bit, but not by huge margin.

Then again, if we don't index and if market is efficient, then what other choices do we have? Picking stocks is a fools game and market is more efficient than it was in 1950-2000 due to information availability.

Let us say in a bad scenario, over 20-30 years of indexing we only get about 3% annual growth rate with dividends reinvested. Pretty bad right? But what else can we do to ""make it""?

16-11-05,5bb1jj,A Guide to the Directional Movement Indicator written by an incompetent buffoon.,"TLDR; Turn back now, you've been warned.

/u/ProGnuRights called me out on some of my bullshit in the last post. I considered calling him a faggot and moving on, but then I decided to /r/theydidthemath.

Turns out that with $AMD over the last few months when the opening price was above the upper band the closing price was statistically more likely to be above the open than below it! (to be fair the daily low was still below, but that's not the point) Mr. Antelope was right, of course, that we need to look at more than just the range at which a given stock trades. Christ, I even said as much in the original post. So to satisfy the objections of those who either have zero reading comprehension, are simply contrarians, or are secretly fundamentalists butthurt that I haven't given them any love yet, I proudly present...

Lesson Two: The Directional Movement Indicator (DMI), sometimes called A.D.M. for Average Directional Movement. Fuck's sake financial industry, get your acronyms sorted!

So why is it that sometimes Bollinger Bands alone seem like they get it wrong? The answer is that we're obviously missing something, and that something is trend. By trend I don't mean the kind of binary events that we usually root for on this sub -Activision beats earnings but drops 5%, seems legit. I'm talking about sustained trends where the stock gains or loses day over day. The DMI is a little more complex than Bollinger Bands, but I think it is important to understand that while a stock may seem overbought (price is too high) if the overall trend is still going up you might still want to wait to sell. Conversely if the price is low you might want to wait to buy until it looks like it's going to stop going down (this has been singlehandedly my downfall, well that and betting at random).  DMI can help with that.

The calculation of DMI is a bitch with lots of exponential moving averages and tons of calculations, so I'll spare you some of the nitty gritty. You should also choose a number of days to look backwards. The most widely used is 14 days. I don't know why, so don't ask. Also use however many days you want, I'm not going to hold your hand with this. The first thing you need to do is figure out the general upward strength (+DM) and the general downward strength (-DM). I've seen this plastered all over the internet, so I'm going to shamelessly rip it off here too (I'm assuming all credit goes to J. Welles Wilder, who invented this whole thing).

&gt;UpMove = today's high − yesterday's high
&gt;DownMove = yesterday's low − today's low
&gt;if UpMove &gt; DownMove and UpMove &gt; 0, then +DM = UpMove, else +DM = 0
&gt;if DownMove &gt; UpMove and DownMove &gt; 0, then −DM = DownMove, else −DM = 0

Next we need the Average True Range (ATR). It's basically the biggest move among highs and lows over the last few days, averaged over time. The first actual indicators (DI) are the exponential moving average of DMs divided by ATR. If you're legitimately on the spectrum or preparing this for professional consumption (God save you if that's the case and you're getting your info from me) this would be a good time to multiply the DIs by 100 to make them proper percentages. I don't do that because I don't care.

&gt;+DI = 100 * EMA(+DM / ATR)
&gt;-DI = 100 * EMA(-DM / ATR)

When the ATR is high it means that there is a lot of price volatility, meaning we should expect to see many days where we open higher than yesterday, and conversely closed lower today than yesterday. Shit's moving sideways, and so the denominator of our fraction makes the result lower. -you need a bigger trend to make +DI significant if the current trading range is large, and *vice versa*.

The final piece is the ADX or Average Directional Index.

&gt;ADX=100 * EMA(ABS((+DI - -DI) / (+DI + -DI)))

That is to say that the ADX is the exponential moving average of the absolute value of the +DI minus the - DI (this is big when there is a big difference between them) divided by the +DI plus the -DI (the overall range of DIs, if one DI is small and the other is large it pushes the ADX up because you're dividing a number by a number that is not substantially different than itself. See the subtraction in the numerator). We take the absolute value because we don't want sign differences between positive trends and negative trends to affect the calculations. 

Now how do you use the bloody things? ADX measures the strength of a trend and the DIs tell you the direction. It is widly held that ADX &gt; 25 indicates a strong trend, so maybe you go with that. Maybe you don't go with that, it's your call. A key event to look for is a point at which the DIs cross (meaning that one value that was less than the other becomes greater than it -the lines cross). If ADX is high and the bands cross this is a signal that a trend is beginning. As ADX rises the trend strengthens. Eventually either the trend weakens as the stock begins trading sideways or the DIs cross and the trend reverses. I think it should go without saying but the +DI rises in upward trends and the -DI rises in downward trends. 

Actual TL;DR

When ADX &gt; 25 and +DI &gt; -DI then buy, especially if +DI has been moving upward. Sell once +DI = -DI
Don't blame me when you lose money with this retarted strategy.",24

***
How to interpret this? In four of five states voting on November 8, legalization is almost certain. Only Nevada is uncertain. By far the most important ballot measure is California’s. 

Conclusions for investors? There will likely be an explosion of enthusiasm for marijuana stocks on November 9 as the public wakes up to news on Nov 9 that 1/4 of Americans can grow and consume marijuana legally. Or conversely, the likelihood of legalization is already baked in to marijuana stocks. Most US marijuana stocks are vulnerable to manipulation. As an investor I have very little trust in any direct investment into the industry.

For now, I’d suggest riding the wave of enthusiasm with an investment into an ancillary business. The largest legitimate company with skin in the game right now is **Scotts Miracle Gro - $SMG**. It has made aggressive moves to acquire hardware and hydroponics companies to generate products for home marijuana growing. SMG is betting that millions of new potential growers will look to get started with crops and invest in specialized hardware. They created a subsidiary Hawthorne Gardening company, with the goal of investing 500m into the sector. Their sales relating to hydroponic hardware, lighting, and specialized fertilizers are higher margins than the rest of their products, and that segment of the business is growing rapidly, relative to the rest of their products. 


 Acquisitions they’ve made in the last year:

* $136m for Gavita, a dutch grow lighting and hardware company. 

* $130m for general hydroponics 

* Botanicare, plant nutrient and hydroponics provider with $40m sales last year

Indoor marijuana production accounts for more than half of the market. Industrial marijuana processes will be much slower moving, especially in a still-uncertain regulatory environment. Large and established growers will wait until federal legalization to enter the market. Expect tobacco companies to take it over at that point. So ancillary companies which assist household marijuana production seems like a fair immediate bet. Scotts has become a decent proxy for the marijuana industry without being exposed to the same regulatory issues (they’ve kept their hands clean) and they have a traditional business segment too. Even though their stock as rallied coming into the election, I would expect it will appreciate if the California ballot measure passes. They also pay a fair 2.26% dividend. 

Some drawbacks with Scotts: 

* There has been [a fair bit of insider selling recently](http://imgur.com/a/jZ4uK)

* Their price is near all-time highs 

* Long term debt makes up ~70% of their capital structure  

What do you think? Any other suggestions for marijuana stocks that might be affected by the election? Thoughts on any other large companies with obvious exposure?

""But I think there's another issue on the table that we have not yet discussed that I talked about three years ago, and that is the seismic shift in consumer traffic.

I was talking to Fred Smith just a couple of weeks ago about his situation at FedEx and he shared with me a piece of research which showed a significant drop in foot traffic on Main Street and in malls, not only domestically and around the world, as a result of e-commerce, the Web, and what I'll loosely describe as the Amazon effect. As a result of that, you're certainly seeing large companies and small companies not only not open new stores, but announce closures.

And let me just speak to that. I know this is a little long-winded but I think it's important. **There's no doubt that over the next five years or so, we are going to see a dramatic level of retailers not be able to sustain their level of core business as a traditional bricks-and-mortar retailer, and their omni-channel approach is not going to be sustainable to maintain their cost of their infrastructure.** And as a result of that, there's going to be tremendous amount of changes with regard to the retail landscape.

We believe, as we look down that pipe and look at the future, that our ability to maintain our growth in terms of new stores domestically and internationally, coupled with the fact that Starbucks still maintains a very special place in terms of a sense of community, the third place environment, and people looking for and seeking out human contact and a place to go, that as these store closures occur, and they will, that we are going to be in a very unique position five years, 10 years down the road because there's going to be a lot less people competing for those customers. I'm not talking about the coffee category; I'm talking overall.

But we are in the very, very early stages of a tremendous change in the bricks-and-mortar footprint of retailers domestically and internationally as a result of the sea change in how people are buying things, and that's going to have, I think, a negative effect on all of retail. But we believe that it's going to have ultimately a positive effect on the position that we occupy and the environment that we create in our stores.""

I'll continue to want to stay away from the mall when it comes to investing - including mall-centric retailers and mall REITs.

*****

&gt; ###Pre-game and post-game, Wall Street will be handicapping outcomes of what has been the most contentious presidential election in recent history, and either way, markets could remain both volatile and vulnerable in the week ahead.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###As the race tightened between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump coming into November, stocks have been under pressure. The S&amp;P 500 ended the past week down 1.9 percent at 2,085.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###For months, the market had been pricing in a win by Clinton, and the idea that a Republican controlled Congress would keep her policies in check placated normally Republican Wall Street. Many analysts expect the market to rise several percent in a relief rally if she wins, but it could sell off sharply if the White House goes to Trump.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###""What happens Monday and Tuesday, who knows? There's this general feeling that on Wednesday, people think it's binary. Trump wins, the market goes down. Hillary wins, the market goes up. It's more nuanced than that,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group. ""If Hillary wins, and Democrats take the Senate, if you own health care or financial stocks, you're not going to be happy that Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are running the Senate.""
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###There is also some concern that if the election is close, and Trump loses, he might challenge the outcome, creating more uncertainty for markets.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###""We should all hope the winner, no matter who it is, is clear cut. We don't want to hear about whining losers. We want to elect the person and move on,"" Boockvar said.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###Barclays analysts estimate the S&amp;P 500 could lose as much as 11 to 13 percent if Trump wins, and it faces headwinds of 4 to 5 percent if his probability of winning gets to 50 percent. They based their analysis on market moves and the election odds, after the first presidential debate. They also examined moves after the news of an FBI investigation into Clinton emails, and when Trump won key Republican primaries. PredictIt.org on Friday put the odds of a Trump win at 31 percent and a Clinton win at 74 percent, an improvement of about 6 points for Clinton over Thursday's level.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###Keith Parker, Barclays global equity strategist, said the market may sell off on a Trump victory, but like the period after the U.K. Brexit vote in June, stocks may bounce back as investors focus on the economy and growth. The Fed is also expected to continue to be accommodative, and perhaps not hike rates, as expected in December if markets are turbulent.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###""I think the real key is equities are all about confidence, and … my analysis is probably based on Trump's policies toward trade and immigration, which are very much a risk to economic growth, while his other policies on tax and fiscal spending are positive for growth. My clue as a strategist is that I would look to whether we see 'good Trump' or 'bad Trump,'"" said Parker.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###Whether the market would spring back in a 'V,' like it did after Brexit, is not clear. ""I think that really is predicated on Trump's rhetoric and also what you're getting out of the economic data,"" he said. Parker said the market is still not pricing high enough odds of a Trump win, and it could be volatile Monday and Tuesday, ahead of the election results.

Since 1950, there have only been 22 other S&amp;P 500 daily losing streaks of eight or more days. 11 of 22 went onto last 9 or more days. The worst by performance occurred early in October 2008 when S&amp;P 500 plunged 22.9% in eight trading days. The longest losing streak was in April and May 1966 at twelve days. Once the streak ended, S&amp;P 500 generally enjoyed a nice bounce and reversal of trend. This bounce and reversal can be seen in the above chart of S&amp;P 500 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after a losing streak of eight or more consecutive trading days.

In the following table, S&amp;P 500 performance 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-months after an eight straight day losing streak appears. 1-month later is somewhat mixed however, the average gain is 1.81%. 3-months after is stronger with S&amp;P 500 up 68.2% of the time averaging 4.5%. 6-months and 1-year later S&amp;P 500 further improved.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: Election Day Seasonality Suggests Market Rally**
&gt; October did live up to its reputation of being weak in Election years. For S&amp;P 500 October’s 1.9% decline was its second worst monthly performance this year and it was also the third consecutive down month. DJIA has also declined in three straight months. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 suffered the most damage in October, off 2.3% and 4.8% respectively. October’s poor performance in presidential election years has historically been accompanied by an incumbent party loss since 1952 (see page 28 of Stock Trader’s Almanac 2016). In the following chart the 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after the last 16 presidential elections are plotted.

&gt; In the above chart, Election Day is Day 0. Prior to 1984, the market was closed on Presidential Election Days so the close on the day before was used. Since 1984, the close of trading on Election Day was used. Day 26, to the left of “0” was the first trading day of October in 2016. As of today’s close, S&amp;P 500 is suggesting an Incumbent party defeat. It is also noteworthy to observe weakness across all three lines between 10 to 5 Trading days before Election Day and then a rally from right around 5 Trading days before to Election Day.

16-11-06,5be66z,Cannabis Industry Analysis,"With all of the talk about cannabis lately I thought I would do some research and share it with the group.

I found around 50 publicly-traded companies that operate in this industry in various capacities. Most are previously-failed microcap companies that are trying to recover by moving into this space. 

The companies I found are listed here -&gt; https://fintel.io/industry/list/cannabis-medical-marijuana-dispensaries

I cross-referenced these companies with my database of 13F filings to see if there is any trend. I didn’t find anything particularly significant yet, but keep in mind 13F’s are filed by funds with over 100M AUM, and it’s likely that the cannabis companies are too small or volatile. None of my analysis covers startups or privately-held companies. However I do plan on looking into Form D’s in the future which should provide more clarity for them.

Here is that data -&gt; https://fintel.io/industry/investment/cannabis-medical-marijuana-dispensaries

    Period	Owners	Total Shares	Percent Change
    in Shares	Fair Market Value (USD)	Percent Change
    in Value

The SIPC can get involved, and the thing that scares me is that the SIPC can sue you for any profits you made off of your investments before the firm was found to be fraudulent.

If you have access to an investment which returns guaranteed 4% annually, what % of your portfolio would you allocate to it?

EDIT: I suppose I should clarify the situation a little bit: I based these questions on the idea that equity risk premium is tightening from another thread in this sub. In the future, a lot of experts seem to expect the stock market to only return 5-6% nominal annually. That being said, if you have guaranteed 4% return, what would your retirement portfolio split be between these two assets? Obviously, everyone's risk tolerance is different but I just want to see what people think.

For those who are curious about the investment, check out AICPA GVUL's Fixed Account investment. It guarantees at least 4% return annually. Granted, it is only for CPAs and the total amount is limited by your age and your insurance coverage. I compared the cost of insurance and after the annual refund, it is slightly cheaper than similar term life insurance.",6

Edit: was hoping to get some ideas generated. Here's a couple plays I've got at work. 

1. Spread trade on wheat futures between Minne and Kansas. It will narrow, take March or May (to play it 
safe). Leveraged to the tits.

2. OTM calls on Chicago wheat, again March or May. Look at a 1 year continuation chart. We've seen or been close to the bottom.

3. OTM May calls on beans. Should see some decent volatility going into Feb. Big harvests are pressuring these markets and demand will flow steady.

Just my two cents.

Edit 2: Had some pm's about oil, fuk me. I was trying to get away from this. Every time we've gotten around the $50 mark on the nearby, we're shorting with leverage up to our position limits. This is based on the fact that we hedge for several oil companies. When we see oil firms selling the shit outta $50 on the nearby with a decent carry a year out, we follow suit. Once we see less hedging at the $50 mark, we will re-evaluate our strat. ",10

There is more and more evidence coming out to show that fat isn't the enemy and never was.

High fat low carb diet is growing popular.

We aren't talking high fat as in McDs and KFC, but more avocadoes, nuts, olive oil, dairy, coconut oil etc etc....

People are eating this and shedding weight and getting really healthy.  Their lab work is great.

16-11-06,5biirs,Is buying stock in an industry more/less profitable,"So off the bat, I just want to say I know practically nothing about stocks, and I'm sure this is a very stupid question for some reason or another.

Basically, if you think an industry is growing, but you aren't sure which company in the industry is going to come out growing the most, wouldn't it be a lot safer to invest equally in many different companies in the industry (or, at least a few of the biggest ones) rather than buying most into one and hoping it will turn out the better one?

Is this a thing people already do? Is it more or less profitable than just buying into one company?",1
16-11-06,5bij47,Q4 Retail Earnings Trade (DD Inside),"In light of the all time high levels of baseless Election posts, I’ve decided to write up the hypothesis for a trade I’m making this week. So if you actually like money, and want a defined risk trade to make some, take off your tinfoil hat and pull the TVIX dick out of your mouth, and see below.

The retail sector has had a rough year if you’re not AMZN. Guidance has been weak and retailers have resorted to cost cutting and non-gaap EPS numbers to stay afloat. Macy’s got a pop last quarter on the news it was CLOSING its failed negative-cash flow stores. Meanwhile AMZN revenues were up 28% last quarter - I think they will continue to take share from the brick &amp; mortar.

Consumer spending has been anemic at &lt;.4% all year except for a slight pop in April/May after gas prices were under $2 for a few months. September spending ticked upward again but I suspect that was due to back-to-school shopping.

4 Major Retailers are reporting Q4 earnings next week. M, JWN, KSS on 11/10 and JCP on 11/11. Options are pricing an 8% move for M, 10% for JWN, 9% for KSS, and 11% for JCP.

Charts:

M http://imgur.com/CaaJfDn

JWN http://imgur.com/SfcDUIn

KSS http://imgur.com/COeS8ZP

JCP http://imgur.com/GLLQtQg

Since one these could surprise report good numbers AND guidance, I’m not going to take a chance on a single underlying. I’m going to play XRT which has more liquid options action. Let’s take a look at the XRT chart: http://imgur.com/jgJPS7X

Head and shoulders pattern testing the 200 MA for the third time this year. I think XRT can go 10% lower over the next few months.

The Trade:

I think it will take some time for XRT to drop 10% so I’m buying some extra time on this one. I’m buying the XRT January 41.5 Put and Selling the January 35 Put. I plan to enter the trade tomorrow after the market rises a bit in light of the recent Clinton email news. You should be able to buy this spread for around $1.50, leaving about $5 in profit.

I think even though the weed market wasn't going to be immediately impacted by a Trump win, he is such a volatile candidate with an unknown stance on the drug that his win could have negated any price gains that would come from all 9 states going pro weed.

""BERLIN—Regulators in California recently discovered software installed on some of Volkswagen AG’s Audi models that appears to have allowed the cars to cheat carbon-dioxide emissions testing standards, according to people familiar with the matter.

The Audi software was designed to mask emissions implicated in global warming, instead of smog as in the Volkswagen emissions-cheating scandal that erupted last year, the people said.

The newly discovered software was detected four months ago during laboratory tests by the California Air Resources Board, one of the people said. Neither Volkswagen nor U.S. regulators have publicly disclosed the discovery.

16-11-07,5blrzg,Stock-Based Compensation always preferred over cash?,"Hi,

I was puzzling with SBC when I came to the conclusion that SBC is always the preferred method for firms to compensate their employees. 

Tesla has a market cap of 30 billion with 150 million shares outstanding, for a share price of 200 dollars per share. This year, it has 100 million in overhead costs that it can either pay by cash or rewarding the employees with shares (500,000 shares needed). 

If it gives them the shares, the share price will be 30 billion/150.5 million = 199.3355 share price.

It it pays them in cash, the share price will be 29.9 billion/150 million = 199.3333 share price.

This difference is increasing with the %increase of amount of shares outstanding (log?). For example: Assume the same situation but with a company that has 200 dollars value, 100 shares outstanding (2 dollar per share) and has to pay 50 in overhead costs. Either it uses SBC or cash:

SBC new situation: 200/125 = 1.6 per share
Cash new situation: 150/100 = 1.5 per share

In both these situations, it is assumed that the market value of a company equals it balance sheet fundamentals (Assets - Liabilities), but I found no difference if I used ""Fundamentals + Expected future increase in value"" instead.

How is this possible? This would mean that each company is better of using SBC?

I hope to hear your insights.

Kind regards",2

16-11-07,5bn282,common mainstream misconceptions about equity market and economy correlations,"Income inequality is good, not bad: Income inequality means less people are competing with existing incumbent businesses, allowing incumbents to continue monopolizing their industry. As income inequality grows, equity markets grow and continue booming, not bust.

Less people starting businesses is a bad thing: You hear this from people like Mark Cuban and a lot of analyst on CNBC or other financial news outlets. (Don't listen to them, they are for entertainment only). But the truth is less entrepreneurs equates to less competition to incumbents, allowing the incumbents to further establish themselves. If a business does pose a threat, that business is either bought or killed. The days where a company go from Facebook with a $1B valuation to a $350B valuation are over. 
Don't believe me? Look at the market cap of ALL companies STARTED post 2000, combine them, and it's less than the market cap of Facebook.

The gig economy is amazing for corporate america, not bad: Don't need to pay health insurance, or retirement? Can make employees dispensable? Great. Don't be foolish, people don't grow up aspiring to be Uber drivers, it's just drivel you hear in the media. People do freelance type work because they have to. In other words, they can't start their own self-sustaining, independent businesses and they can't find employment, so they enter servitude-work.

Overall, as long as people are poor enough to spend all or most their money (this is a thing, the poorer people are the more money as a % of their wealth they spend, as desperation and negative long-term outlook sets in. Good example is lottery tickets, an act of desperation) but rich enough to not want to riot and cause unrest, the stock market will continue to rise. Keep people on thing s like food stamps to keep them full for example, otherwise unrest sets in.

And this is the direction the world, not the country per se is headed in. What to make of all this? There will be an unprecedented bull market for as long as income inequality and lack of business start-ups continue. With millennials being the LEAST entrepreneurial generation in american history (lots of amazing reads on this, just look it up, huge decline in business startups in the recent 18-35 yr old generation compared to previous generations) corporatism will keep growing stronger and will be more embedded. 

So next time you retweet a Bernie Sanders tweet about income inequality, just remember there's incentive to further income inequality, not stop it. ",1

Gold will also be a good play in both scenarios, maybe not as great in a Trump win. People are saying gold is a Hillary play, but look at the charts. JDST still went up when market was freaking out about Hillary going to jail and JUNG has still been going down. Just remember that gold still reacts to actual factors of gold production while the election can swing these i'm gonna be watching guns because I don't keep up with gold even though it can be a good play.

# Description
The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (Scotts Miracle-Gro) is a manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer lawn and garden products. Think lawn and grass seed products; gardening and landscape products; insect control, weed control, rodent control products, fertilizers, and herbicides. In addition to the core business, they also own 30% of the largest lawn care service business in the United States. They got that stake when they merged their business with the no.1 player.

## Recent financials 

I can't admit to be in love with recent performance. Sales don't appear to be doing dramatically. Nor profitability. Quite a bit of their growth has come from acquisitions and although volumes have been positive, pricing and a strong dollar have hurt them. Note: the US is 85% of the business. 

|Year end Sept|2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $2.8bn| $3.0bn | $2.8bn | $2.8bn | $2.8bn | $2.7bn|
|EPS | $5.17| $2.57 | $2.64 | $2.55 | $1.80 | $2.38|

Apart from that I was shocked by the $300m payment to Monsanto in 2015...for licensing rights to a product called ""Roundup"" that generates circa $130m of sales annually. Wow!

## Competition

When to comes to the peers I was surprised to see 2 of them on the stock market: Spectrum &amp; Central!

&gt; In the U.S. lawn and garden and pest control markets, our products compete against private-label as well as branded products. Primary competitors include Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc., Bayer AG, Central Garden &amp; Pet Company, Enforcer Products, Inc., Kellogg Garden Products, Oldcastle Retail, Inc. and Lebanon Seaboard Corporation.

But let's not just think of the competition, they have 3 very important customers...each representing more than 10% of sales.

&gt;  Our three largest customers are Home Depot, Lowe’s and Walmart. 

In fact it's a lot scarier... HD is 34% of sales, LOW is 17% and WMT is 12%. Now that's concentration.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Scotts Miracle-Gro Co | $2,836M | 19% | 38%
Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. | $5,098M | 17% | 17%
Central Garden &amp; Pet Co | $1,802M | 9% | 9%
Biggest customers | | | 
Home Depot Inc | $92,033M | 16% | 97%
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. | $483,833M | 7% | 19%
Lowe's Companies, Inc. | $61,090M | 11% | 36%

NB: from a margin and returns perspective. SMG is best in the group of 3.

## Cash / Debt?

Scotts Miracle-Gro Co has $1,266M of net debt. That is 2.3x it's latest operating profit. Rather high, but manageable. And important to note they aren't shy of using shares to do deals too. 

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $87.50 for Scotts Miracle-Gro Co and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies no upside. So seems like the ""Buy"" consensus is out of date.

# Valuation

The stock's on 20x earnings, though frankly I fear that's not GAAP but their Adjusted earnings. As they are constantly making adjustments for impairment charges etc.

I'm never a fan when management feels obliged to product their own non-GAAP earnings figures, and management teams that love presenting ""EBITDA"" margins as an alternative way to look at cashflow. Fine... investment bankers love this data as they use it for debt ratios, but I'm an equity boy... I care about cashflow to me the shareholder (sic Ed, rant over. Apols).

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/smg/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
SMG | $5,295M | 20x | 10% | 2% | 9%
SPB | $7,805M | 25x | 13% | 1% | 7%
CENT.O | $1,166M | 20x | 10% | 0% | 7%
Biggest clients |  |  |  |  | 
HD | $149,393M | 19x | 14% | 2% | 8%
WMT | $213,930M | 16x | 2% | 3% | 14%
LOW | $57,946M | 17x | 16% | 2% | 9%

Rant aside, the stock doesn't look expensive, but you can't call it cheap either. 

# Dividends
Scotts Miracle-Gro Co is forecast to pay a dividend of $2.07 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $1.41 per share. That is a 47% growth. The forecast dividend of $2.07 compares to a forecast EPS of $4.28. So plenty of room!

On top of this they have the right to buyback shares.

# Share Structure

Note the Miracle-Gro family, the Hagedorns own 26% of the shares

&gt; and, thus, have the ability to significantly influence the election of directors and other actions requiring the approval of Scotts Miracle-Gro’s shareholders.

Unsurprisingly, Jim Hagedorn is the Chairman and CEO.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 6% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 13%. They reported for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2016, last week. For the next year, they expect to see high single digit sales growth, continued margin expansion, that could lead to double digit EPS growth...of adjusted earnings. 

So, it's hard to be worried in the near term, the core business is performing well, the non-core ""lawn-services"" was consolidated into the market leader, and hopefully the worst of the strong dollar is behind us! And separate to all that there is a ""Hydroponics"" theme. Though I really can't tell if that's important as a driver. Sorry. 

But do I want to pay 20x earnings for it? Maybe, just maybe! If I can convince myself it's a Quality stock!

16-11-08,5bpynf,"U.S. banks gird for Brexit-style tumult following Tuesday's election","(Reuters) - U.S. banks, including Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, are bracing for potential tumult on financial markets in the wake of Tuesday's U.S. election.

Bank preparations ahead of the election reflect their experience following Britain's shock vote to leave the European Union in June, when the S&amp;P 500 fell 3.6 percent the day after the poll.

Morgan Stanley told staff to consider using stop-loss orders, an automated trading mechanism that sells an investor's position as soon as a stock hits a preset level, if the election result causes trading volumes and volatility to spike.

The bank also told advisers in its wealth management unit to prepare for election-related conversations with clients and pointed them to relevant pieces of research, according to a Nov. 7 memo reviewed by Reuters.

Traders expect U.S. stock prices to swing by about 2 percent in either direction on Wednesday, the day after the election, based on the price of S&amp;P 500 index options. Options on the PowerShares QQQ Trust Russell 2000 ETF, are pricing similarly large swings before the week is out.

Some banks are projecting a more extreme drop in the event of a victory for Republican Donald Trump, with Citigroup Inc estimating that a Trump victory could trigger a 3 percent to 5 percent sell-off for the S&amp;P 500.

U.S. stocks rose on Monday as Democrat Hillary Clinton’s prospects brightened after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it would not press criminal charges related to her use of a private email server while secretary of state.

Investors have tended to see Clinton as a more status quo candidate, while Trump's stances on foreign policy, trade and immigration have unnerved the market.

The latest twist in the campaign and ensuing stock market rally appears to have quelled a broad push for banks to staff for an all-hands-on-deck event.

The ""market pretty much told you who was going to win today,"" said one capital markets official at a major bank who was not planning any extraordinary staffing measures.

Another official at a rival bank said Monday's 2.2 percent rally in U.S. stocks had lowered Wall Street's collective angst over the election from ""DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 2.""

No U.S. stock exchange plans extraordinary measures to cope with potential market volatility, exchange officials told Reuters on Monday.

After the election, Morgan Stanley will hold a call for financial advisers and clients with Chief Investment Officer Mike Wilson on Wednesday morning.

Goldman Sachs is also hosting a call for its private wealth clients led by Chief Investment Officer Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani and members of Washington lobbying groups Elmendorf Ryan and CGCN Group, according to an invitation sent to clients.

More than half of the stock and bond fund managers polled by Northern Trust in the third quarter said they expected the election to cause a large increase in market volatility.

On Tuesday night, when results begin to come in, JPMorgan will have additional traders on duty in New York to back up its Asian trading teams in case of surges in volume, said bank spokesman Brian Marchiony.

The extra staffing is similar to what the bank did during Britain's vote to leave the European Union, he said.

On Wednesday morning, JPMorgan will hold conference calls to discuss the election results and investment implications with customers, including private banking clients, investment managers and institutional clients.

A Citigroup spokeswoman described similar plans, including overnight staff in New York on the trading floor.

Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo &amp; Co are also hosting calls for members of their wealth management divisions.

When a fund says it beat the market and returned 7% and that is net of fees..why do ppl care that fees were 3% lets say ? If you want 7% and get 7 % you are happy no ? It's not like the index fund will give you the full 10%. Assuming they track the same index..and the index fund matches it.. if the mutual fund beats the index by a lot..why do ppl care about the high fees.?

Example: i told a financial advisor that i would be happy with a return of 7% and he said..here's a mutual fund that does that. it had 2% fees. (i'm in Canada...high fees) so in other words that fund returned 9..they kept 2..and i got 7.  I told him i dont like the high fees and he told me..why do you carE? you still get your 7.

Tesla Motors Inc. agreed to buy German manufacturing-technology provider Grohmann Engineering GmbH as the U.S. maker of electric cars prepares to roll out its first mass-market model.
The equipment maker, led by founder and Chief Executive Officer Klaus Grohmann, will become the basis of an automation division Tesla is setting up in Germany that will create about 1,000 jobs, the Palo Alto, California-based company said Tuesday in a statement. Tesla plans to complete the purchase by early 2017. Financial terms weren’t disclosed.

“Several critical elements of Tesla’s automated manufacturing systems will be designed and produced” at Grohmann’s headquarters plant in the town of Pruem, Tesla said. “Combined with our California and Michigan engineering facilities, as well as other locations to follow, we believe the result will yield exponential improvements in the speed and quality of production, while substantially reducing the capital expenditures required per vehicle.”

16-11-08,5brnpx,How does income from a trust asset exactly gets distributed to a trust beneficiary?,"In my mind, this is how it works:

The trust asset is either a business (operating company), or a holding company of a operating company, or a property, that is held on trust.

So for example, if it is a business, the business earns profit which is deposited into it business bank account.

The business, as it is held on a trust, then distributes dividends to the bank account held by the trust.

The trustee, or trust company, then writes instructions to the law firm managing the trust that the trustee is to distribute so and so income (as specified when setting up the trust) to the beneficiary.

If the trust asset is a property, the rental income goes directly into the bank account of the trust.

Is that how it works?",1

16-11-08,5btlxa,Easy way to Hedge Against possible downturn (x-pos r\StockMarket),"With so many events causing uncertainty and potentially reversing the market direction (new president, arguably overvalued market, fed interest rate hike, etc) as a non-active trader I have been thinking about ways to hedge or potentially profit from a potential market downturn.
For background I’ve been buying (and occasionally selling) stocks for a long time (10+years), I watch the markets fairly closely and follow the news for the stocks I own but I don't really have the time or confidence to trade in and out of my positions all the time or get involved in options trading but I want to attempt to at least position myself so I’m not always 100% betting on the market going up all the time.
I was thinking about buying a short S&amp;P 500 ETF such as SH with the idea being I could sell if the market drops significantly at some point to either lock in cash gains or perhaps use the proceeds to buy more shares in my long term positions at what would likely be historically lower prices\valuations. My theory is while my long term positions may lose value on paper due (something I can live with as I’ve already been through a major downturn) but they will eventually return to previous levels over the long term and I will have taken advantage of the market reversal to some extent without doing anything too risky. On the flip side if the market just keeps marching up or even shoots up drastically if Hillary wins I would have a paper loss in the short term on the short ETF but it seems like with enough time there will eventually be a correction or downturn and this position could then be sold at a profit. Does this sound like a reasonably sound idea or is there something I’m missing?",2

16-11-08,5brmid,Why you should be shorting the market.,"So as we all know tomorrow is the US presidential election, and this is where the money is made. Big four year information pit to make all those sick gains. Now everyone has been talking about how if Trump wins the stock market is going to decline, Peso is going to shit and the USD will lose ground on first world currency baskets. 

However, they have also been implying that if Clinton wins that the markets will rally and we will see a strengthening dollar. BUT THIS  IS WRONG&gt;&gt;&gt;. Based on my analysis of todays rally the market has already priced in a Clinton win (even though they are counting out the man who is  going to win and has been counted out all year already but overcome it). 

A Trump or Clinton win will be a short fest. Because all the cucks who were waiting for Clinton to win will realize that there is  not value left in the markets for a rally and that they already doomed themselves to 4 years of unstable economic corruption, the FBI clearing clinton allowed for the markets to price in a Clinton victory so once she wins markets will be flat to slight decline and then drop over the following week as all the ignorant liberal traders realize what they just doomed themselves too for the next 4 years. 

Short USD, Short S&amp;P500, get back on that volatility trade. This  is gonna be YUUUUGE. We're going to the moon regardless  of the president. ",2

16-11-08,5bskew,Options Question from a Lvl 2 Certified,"Faggot.

Okay, new to options here. And I have an idea.

If you have a stock you're interested in holding for the long term, why don't you buy the stock, then constantly write OTM covered calls and OTM cash-secured puts against it?

Here's my logic:
1.) You're constantly collecting premiums on both ends. Hell yeah.
2.) If it shoots up to your calls strike price, it's a triple win. You keep your put premium, you obviously still keep the call premium, and then you sell your stock for a nice profit. If it falls back down after that, you can get in again. Otherwise, move onto your next good idea.
3.) If it falls down to your puts strike price, it's still a win. You keep both premiums (making your shares cheaper) and you're buying more of this stock you believe in (pretty much averaging down, but better). If this happens and you have more shares, you can start writing more covered calls against all your shares (now double) and collect those premiums.
4.) If it moves sideways, you keep both premiums. That's a win.
5.) Rinse and repeat.

Someone please pull me out of the closet and tell my parents I'm a faggot. What's wrong with my idea?",3

16-11-08,5burne,Indian Govt Debt is going to be upgraded and the Indian stock market is in for a boost.,"The Indian govt outlawed the current 1000 an 500 denominations today. **The entire country got 4 hours notice.** 

People have until Dec 31 to deposit/exchange their current cash at home of those denominations. 

The move comes with the intent to force out 'black money' and reduce corruption since it means you have declare what you have and pay taxes on it or lose all of it. 

However, going forward it also means a greater amount of money will be taxable which increases the tax collections which means the govt debt will get an upgrade from the rating agencies. That means lower country risk premiums which means lower borrowing costs in general which means a boost to the stock market. 

Thoughts?

[story on bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-08/india-abolishes-inr500-1-000-rupee-notes-to-fight-corruption)

EDIT: Hereare the sectors that I think will benefit the most from this announcement.

Banks: 

- Massive one time jump in deposits means an increase in their loan making capacity. 
- probably a jump in number of cards issued and transaction volume through them since no one likes carrying lots of small currency. Banks get a % of each transaction and charge annual fees for credit cards.

Payment processors: (Visa, Mastercard, AmEx etc)

- transactions volume on cards and electronically are going to rise particularly on big ticket items, which means the processors get more money even if their fees charged remain constant

Card Issuers

- the actual makers of the cards will see a massive uptick in demand for new cards

Debt heavy companies

- lower cost of borrowing

The sectors likely to suffer

Real Estate

- a big chunk of every real estate deal in India is funded by undeclared wealth. That's no longer possible so the ability to pay will fall

Precious metals

- while marriage gets the headlines, a lot of gold demand in India comes from a need to convert undeclared cash into a more easily movable commodity which has traditionally been gold

Luxury retail

- this is probably a net reduction in disposable wealth in the aggregate so these get hurt.",70

But this election was hardly conventional, wouldn't you agree?

EDIT

I've set sell limits at about -3% for ETFs that track the SP and broad market. Who knows if it'll go through. If it does, the idea is that the resulting sell-off would dip far below 3%. Whether I buy back in at -5 or -15, I'm comfortable with my gamble. 

Perhaps ""panic"" sell was the wrong term to use. I think my assumptions (the market will dip a little before dipping a lot before going back up) are relatively simple and reliable, but I guess many disagree.

I read Ben Graham's ""The Intelligent Investor"" and picked stocks following his guidelines.  I also paid for a stock-picking service through Investors Business Daily.

When I first read Ben's book, the commentary by another author recommended just doing index funds as an easy way to make money from the stock market.  I didn't believe it, I thought it must be harder than that, and I wanted to make more money by managing my portfolio myself.  After about a year of picking my own stocks using Ben's methods and the stock-picking service, I made on average pretty much the exact same amount I would have made if I had just invested all of it into an S&amp;P 500 index.  So I've just kinda given up and I don't even pick my own stocks now, I just put it all into SPY and BND.  Just thought I'd share my limited experience for those traveling down the same road.",0

2. Polls indicate that many swing states remain neck and neck, namely in states like New Hampshire, Florida, and North Carolina. 
3. Democrats have been huge in early voting, but early voting is over. Republicans typically vote on Election Day, and conservative/Republican turnout in the swing states could prove decisive. 

Buckle up, friends. Trump might pull it off tonight by the seat of his pants. If results from the swing states are too close to call by midnight eastern time, prepare for major volatility in the markets tomorrow from the uncertainty. ",6

16-11-09,5c0cvz,"UBS' CIO on Trump and the markets","Here's the email from Mark Haefele, Global Chief Investment Officer Wealth Management @ UBS

NB: **Bold annotations are mine**.

***

## What happened?

Republican Donald Trump appears to have scored an upset victory in the race for the White House, upending the political establishment. The businessman had trailed in the polls throughout the campaign but began to close the gap just prior to the election. Undecided voters broke for Trump as he reiterated his criticism of Hillary Clinton and promised to strengthen border controls. Trump overcame Clinton's strength among Latinos with a surge in votes from rural and suburban America. The betting markets gave him just a 25% chance of occupying the White House, suggesting that recent polls once again failed to gauge the depth of opposition to mainstream politics, and dissatisfaction with elements of globalization.

The Republican Party won highly contested Senate seats in Indiana, North Carolina, and Wisconsin, while retaining Senate seats in Florida and Ohio. The party has retained control not only of the upper chamber, but also the House of Representatives, losing fewer seats than expected. It now appears we have a Republican sweep.

While historically a Republican sweep has been one of the most favorable scenarios for US equity markets (with a median annual total return of 15% for the S&amp;P 500 Index, between 1928 and 2014), Trump's win heralds a period of greater uncertainty in US policy. His lack of governing experience, potential difficulties building relationships with congressional leaders, and inconsistent policy pronouncements during the race make it hard to predict his policy initiatives or his effectiveness in driving them through Congress. Some investors have raised concerns that his election would mark a deterioration in global trade relations. During the campaign Trump pledged a tougher stance in trade talks with key trading partners such as Mexico and China as well as a review of US commitments to global security institutions. Trump also promised a clampdown on illegal immigrants, and his policies, if implemented, could cause the US labor force to contract.

## How did markets react?

The **market reaction to the outcome, in our view, will come in two stages**. A reflexive **flight to safety** has already occurred, with Treasury bond prices rising. The US dollar has declined around 1% on a trade-weighted basis, while safe-haven currencies like the Japanese yen (+2.9%) rallied against USD. And gold also climbed 3.6%. Risk-sensitive assets lost ground – S&amp;P 500 futures fell 4.2%, and the Mexican peso shed 9% against the dollar.

While these first-round effects are certainly disconcerting, we expect the US equity market to recover over the medium term. CIO believes **fundamentals will outweigh political uncertainty** and US stocks can rebound on the back of accelerating earnings per share (EPS) growth. We forecast EPS to rise from 1% this year to 8% next. **Selected industries could benefit** from the possibility of more lenient regulation – particularly the **financial services and energy** sectors. Others businesses, especially those focused on national **defense** infrastructure, could enjoy advantages from more expansionary fiscal policy. Still, policy uncertainty may raise overall equity-market volatility, and lead to market dislocations that short-term investors might look to exploit.


For fixed income markets, we believe **the initial rally in Treasuries will be relatively short lived**. The market-implied probability of a December rate hike by the Federal Reserve fell below 50%, from around 82% on the eve of the vote. But longer term, Trump has promised tax cuts without offsetting expenditure reductions. A deteriorating fiscal outlook could push government borrowing costs higher. Markets are already shifting their central bank policy expectations to account for higher US policy uncertainty, and elevated market turbulence.

## What are we watching?

The implications of this surprise electoral outcome will take time to unfold. Given Trump's limited background in politics, markets will look toward his appointments for top administrative posts for clues about his policy agenda. The result underlines again the importance of investment diversification, both in terms of regions and asset classes.

While there have been some initial signs of stress in global equity markets, we note that Asian markets outside of Japan have been relatively robust, helped by the weakness of the US dollar and comparative stability of the USDCNY exchange rate. We will watch to see whether a weaker USD and lower US Treasury yields help ease financial conditions in global markets, and offset some of the initial asset price volatility.

In our latest Global Risk Radar report (31 October) we outlined a number of global investment ideas in the event of a Trump victory. When markets open in Europe, we will be looking for:

* Eurozone consumer discretionary stocks to underperform the broader market (MSCI EMU), on fears that increased protectionism and a weaker USD will damage the sector's earnings prospects.

**When trading begins** in the Americas, we expect to see:

* US defense companies outperforming the wider US stock market, as we believe a Trump presidency will boost US military spending.
* US managed care providers in the healthcare sector, by contrast, suffering, as Trump has promised to work on repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (known as ""Obamacare"").
* Mexican assets remain under pressure. We expect the Mexican peso to stay weak against the USD, and Mexican equities to underperform emerging market equities overall (MSCI Emerging Markets). A full 80% of Mexican exports are US bound, and 98% of remittances come from Mexican workers in the US. Trump's proposed curbs on immigration and trade may weaken these important economic ties.


We will give a fuller update in another CIO Note later today. This will touch on the day’s market developments worldwide, and examine the potential medium-term economic and investment consequences of a Trump administration.

For me, my whole election trade was based on a smooth Clinton win followed by the VIX falling back towards $14 over the next 2 weeks.

I bought VIX $16 Nov 23rd puts at $1.10 on Friday.
Closed out most at 1.70/85/90 today for around +60% overall.

I let myself down by not being full up to speed on what a volatility crush (my puts were at 200% IV) following the election would do to the premiums so wasn't ready to run them for a week or two like I was when I went into the trade, hence closing most out today and booking profit.

I also realised volume is very light in VIX options, I'd have been better going at one of the other vehicles like VXX. Buying OTM puts for similar expiry (Nov 18th) on Friday would have given me 100-150% easily today with huge liquidity to hit, so that for me has been the major lesson to take.
Almost the exact same trade and risk but in a different product, with twice to three times the return.

Still considering how to play the result tomorrow.",6

Over the past year, the S&amp;P 500 North American Technology Sector Index has risen about six percent.

&gt; The new MacBook Pro generated over seven times the revenue that the 12-inch MacBook did over its first five days of availability, according to Slice Intelligence. If accurate, that means it took the new MacBook Pro just five days to accumulate 78% of all the revenue generated by the 12-inch MacBook since its April 2015 launch. 

&gt; Slice Intelligence extracts detailed information from hundreds of millions of aggregated and anonymized e-receipts. The research firm has a panel of 4.4 million online shoppers signed up for its services such as Slice and Unroll.me. It is also the exclusive e-commerce data provider for the NPD's Checkout Tracking e-commerce service.

16-11-09,5c2ft8,Marijuana Stocks,"So with Massachusetts, Nevada, and California  (now the world's 5th biggest economy) legalizing pot there are a whopping 20% of Americans that now live in an area where pot is legal (up from only 5% yesterday).  The legalization trend isn't going to end.  This means we are in the infancy of a future several hundred billion dollar industry.  I want in.

What we know:

1) Marijuana is still illegal to transfer across state lines even between 2 legal states

2) Until this is repealed California is the market that will have the most growth (no pun intended) as well as the largest market.

3) Due to having an already enourmous market share and infrastructure, California will be one of the major hubs for production and distribution once marijuana becomes legal nationwide.

So my question to anyone who can help guide me in the right answer is what companies exist or are beginning to exist in California that will be one of the major players in the pot industry.",0

The United States has elected the next President, which will no doubt spur way more theories than actual action over the coming months. It has been a few weeks since I wrote anything meaningful regarding Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, but I have been asked quite a lot recently what I see as the outlook. 

*I am writing this article prior to Q3 earnings, as I don't want any emotion regarding what success/failures the company has had to impact the logical sound thinking regarding my opinion.*

___________________________________
**The Election**

This, I believe, was probably the most positive outcome that could have occurred in regards to the bio sector. The ""triforce"" as I am calling it, of the three major parts of government have come under republican control. This is important, as the United States provides so much R&amp;D in the biotech field, which is not cheap. Under Hilary's idea regarding cheap healthcare for everyone, the ability to continue this high level of R&amp;D would be impossible. I agree that healthcare should be available to everyone, but advancing healthcare will allow the majority to remain healthy. 

I believe this will allow big pharma to take a breath, and be ok with expanding their portfolio of drugs without concern of government restrictions on pricing. This will allow for a higher number of mergers and acquisitions in the future. 

___________________________________
**Shire and Manufacturing**

If anyone has been following this as closely as I have, you will also been focused on what actions Shire has been taking. Recently, they closed manufacturing in LA. Furthermore, Flemming (Shire CEO) stated that there are more ""synergies"" coming shortly. This bodes well for Merrimack, as their facilities are state of the art, and also in Kendall Square which is home to Shire. I do find it interesting that Shire would cut manufacturing facilities when their goal is $20billion turnover by 2020, I expect their plan is in motion. 

One interesting idea I did read was in regards to what part of Merrimack Shire may be interested in specifically. The purchase of DYAX by Shire was a move to obtain their phage display tech, which identifies antibodies that can bind to specific targets. Merrimack has a systems biology platform which is able to identify the targets needed to be bound to. The two seem to go hand in hand very well in terms of product development for the future. Furthermore, MM-121 and MM-141 are both in collaboration with DYAX, which further makes all of these moves very intriguing (thank you to sixmilliondollarbios for this idea). 

___________________________________
**Reuters Article**

I have recieved and seen a bunch of speculation regarding the [Reuters article](http://uk.mobile.reuters.com/article/idUKKBN1342QZ) which was released today. Two investment banks are involved in ""strategic review that could result in a sale of some of its assets or a licensing deal"". This was the one line which I believe was too deeply read into. Merrimack, in it's entirety, is Onivyde. As of right now, they have no other income generation, no study submitted to FDA for approval, not even one which has moved publicly into Phase 3. 

The idea which I received most frequently stated that the company would sell Onivyde. What needs to be understood, is that Onivyde comes with the manufacturing, which alone I believe is worth a minimum of $2billion ($15 per share). So the sale of that, may as well include the sale of the entire pipeline. Merrimack was built as a company to be sold, and sold it will be. 

___________________________________
**Final Thoughts**

Just a few updates regarding my view and what I have found out regarding Merrimack since my last post. I am still long Merrimack, and honestly think I will be until there is a buyout. I believe the IBB will begin to head back to all time highs, and may even break the $400 mark. The next few months will be very fun for the bio investor, as all of those big pharama companies release their piles of cash to begin their preparation for the future. 



___________________________________
**EDIT Q3 EARNINGS**

I totally forgot to talk about earnings this afternoon. As much as I would like the earnings to be great, to me, it really has little importance how good they are. I would like to see growth of a stable level, but not worried about anything drastic. Merrimack does not have a group of dedicated sales staff, instead using nurses to sell the product. I do however think that earnings will be good, and should beat expectation.",21

**TRUMP WINS ELECTION, DEMS SCRAMBLE TO FIND QUANTIFIABLE DOWNSIDE**

In a shocking culmination of this year’s hotly-contested race to the White House, Donald Trump has been elected as the 45th President of the United States.  

As dust settles and the news sinks in, Democrats find themselves hunting for things blame on the result of the election.  

“We’re extremely disappointed this morning,” said DNC Interim Chair Donna Brazile.  “The first openly gay governor was elected last night, recreational marijuana became legal in two states, markets are again rocketing skyward, Americans will soon be free to make their own decisions on health insurance, pointless intervention in the Middle East is no longer impending, the mainstream media has finally been humbled, and perhaps most importantly, we’re no longer headed towards a Second Cold War with Russia.”

“Unfortunately,” she continued, “the only negative effect of Trump’s election seems to be millions of millennial sob stories which now clutter Facebook feeds nationwide.” 

President-Elect Trump, himself surprised by the results, vowed to spend the upcoming months watching Schoolhouse Rock! videos in efforts to learn the finer workings of the United States Government.  “Do not worry,” he stated after a humble and sincere acceptance speech.  “I will be working hard - tremendously hard - to prepare for the job of Presidency.  I’ll do lots of work, lots of it.  Absolutely.  There’s an awesome plan in place - awesome plan, really - for everything, and I’m sure we’ll actually Make America Great Again!  We sure will.  Absolutely.”",66

16-11-09,5c1n31,"What's Good/What's Bad This Morning","GOOD:

1. Pharma/Biotech. It's unclear what the next 4 years will look like for healthcare, but today the sector is rallying on the idea of it won't be facing Hilary. I'd still be a little cautious and not declare this an ""all clear"" for the sector.

2. Defense. Trump has talked up defense on multiple occasions. Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and others up quite a bit.

3. Energy. Coal and oil doing well given Trump's discussions on the campaign trail.

MIXED TODAY/POSITIVE GOING FORWARD:

1. Pot. Pot did succeed a great deal in the legalization voting last night. I think you are seeing some sell the news on that today from some of the small stocks (Scott's up another couple %), but I think last night was positive longer-term. The fact that California legalized it alone is huge, but that most of the other states went along too is really quite positive. I do think that it will take longer to get broader realization than most think, but California is going to certainly hurry the process. It looks like even Maine will likely vote to legalize, although that one seems close.

BAD:

1. Anything with an association with Mexico. Constellation Brands (STZ) and especially Kansas City Southern (KSU), given that railroad's exposure to Mexico.

2. Solar. Solar was clearly hoping for a Hilary win.

3. REITs. Concern over a rate hike being very much on the table. I'm not so sure about that, but... meh.

Anyone else feel free to add. I think this sort of discussion may help people try to come up with ideas going forward.",29

They cancelled an important meeting last week for investors and this morning they came out with some very interesting and good results. 

Technicians evaluate the stock from 4.00$ to 14.00$... Reasonably speaking the stock will probably gravitate to around 2.00 in a few months.

Emphasis is his.

***


**Dear reader,**

This year's US election campaign was one of superlatives. Two of the most unpopular candidates competed in one of the most divisive contests ever. Record numbers of key demographic groups turned up to vote. And we have perhaps the most unorthodox winner of a US presidential race in history.

Volatile trading today has yet again demonstrated the importance of a long-term focus for investors. Trading equities at the wrong time today could have permanently impaired wealth. In our tactical asset allocation, we continue to believe that fundamentals should outweigh political risk. We remain overweight US equities and emerging market (EM) equities, against underweights positions in high grade bonds and Swiss equities. And we stay overweight on an EM currency basket against a selection of developed market (DM) currencies.

We also add a new tactical position, an overweight in the euro relative to the US dollar. Signs that the Federal Reserve (Fed) may be falling behind the curve on inflation could mount if general prices rise under Mr. Trump's presidency. Meanwhile, we continue to expect the European Central Bank (ECB) to taper quantitative easing in 2017, favoring a stronger single currency.

For investors seeking additional opportunities, we also highlight a series of potential winners and losers from this election result. US financial services and health care equities, cyber security stocks, US senior loans, and infrastructure-linked investments are all potential beneficiaries.

Volatility is likely to remain relatively high as the market adjusts to a new equilibrium. Investors should therefore keep a long-term focus, but also remain alert to opportunities.

## Three things that caught my eye today:

* **The about turn in markets.** Although equities opened sharply lower in Asia and safe-haven investments rallied, the initial flight to quality moderated after Mr. Trump delivered his victory speech. The President-elect’s more conciliatory tone and pledge to work together with his opponents came as a positive surprise to market participants, many of whom had expected more of the aggressive rhetoric that marked his campaign. Some of the rebound for risk assets could be attributed to markets having 'learned their lesson' from the Brexit fall-out (in which risk assets first fell, then regained their poise). But we believe that positive fundamentals will ultimately prevail. We remain overweight US stocks in global tactical asset allocations.
* **The run up in 10-year yields.** The rise in US Treasury bond yields is one of the more significant moves in response to the election. It is important to note that this doesn't reflect a change in expectations around Fed policy – real rates are close to unchanged, and market pricing for a December rate hike has rebounded to about 80% (close to the pre-election probability). Instead the sell-off in bonds looks to be driven by higher inflation expectations, presumably in anticipation of looser US fiscal policy from a Trump administration. We continue to like US Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS).
* **The decline in Mexican asset prices.** Given that 80% of Mexican exports are US bound, and 98% of remittances come from Mexican workers in the US, the nation’s assets were among the few that failed to retrace their steps meaningfully through the day. Given Trump's proposed curbs on immigration and trade, we think these declines are justified, and we do not see any immediate opportunities in Mexican assets at present.

## What to watch in the months ahead

While Trump's speech has calmed some investors’ nerves, the coming 120 days should be more revealing. We expect the President-elect to give us an insight into how he plans to govern, and whether campaign rhetoric will (or won’t) translate into policy.

In the months ahead investors will need to pay attention to:

* **The President-elect’s nominees.** Trump's campaign was orchestrated by a close circle of advisors, and there is a risk that the presidential victory could reinforce his convictions in a 'closed' leadership style. This strategy would likely produce greater uncertainty for markets.
* **Whether Mr. Trump imposes tariffs, and if so how quickly.** Much of the campaign rhetoric was directed against the US' trading partners, most particularly Mexico and China. We need to see how this translates into action, if, or when, he looks to renegotiate NAFTA, and whether he labels China as a currency manipulator.
* **The results of the Italian referendum.** Although not directly linked to the US, the Italian referendum represents the next litmus test of the rise in voter popularity for anti-establishment candidates or causes. While we do not expect the outcome of the Italian referendum to have a major impact on markets, another setback for the political mainstream could cause jitters ahead of Dutch, French, and German elections next year. Our Short Term Investment Opportunities team is long German Bunds against French OATS as a hedge against rising concerns.

## Tactical asset allocation

In our tactical asset allocation we open an overweight position in the euro relative to the US dollar. Valuation and positioning suggest the US dollar has room to fall further.

* We continue to **overweight US equities relative to high grade bonds**. Fundamentals should outweigh political uncertainty, as private consumption remains solid and companies continue to benefit from easy financial conditions. We forecast corporate earnings per share growth to rise from 1% this year to 8% next.
* We also maintain our **overweight in emerging market equities relative to Swiss stocks**, and our **overweight in an emerging market currency basket**. Key drivers include overall accommodative monetary policy and low yields in advanced economies, undemanding valuations in EM currencies, and some improvement of fundamentals in the developing world. Should global financial market volatility rise further from here, we think a declining chance of a Fed December rate hike would help to limit the downside for EM currencies. Meanwhile, we will closely monitor policy announcements of the new US administration, for indications of measures that could weigh on global trade and growth. We will also look for signs of shifting geopolitical relations between the US and Russia.
* We'd expect our **overweight in US TIPS relative to high grade bonds** to benefit from the election result. Donald Trump's platform has an inflationary bias: his fiscal policy is likely to be expansionary, and he leans toward protectionism, which is inflationary due to the effects of tariffs and curtailed immigration. Both trends should support inflation-linked bonds, therefore making them even more attractive than they would otherwise be.
* Finally, we **add an overweight position in the euro relative to the US dollar**. The euro is around 12% undervalued relative to purchasing power parity based on our estimates. We believe there are indications that the Fed may be falling behind the curve in raising interest rates – wages are growing at the fastest pace in more than five years, and inflation stands at a two-year high. These trends will potentially be exacerbated if the Fed allows for a more “high pressure” economy over an extended period. Meanwhile, economic fundamentals in the Eurozone continue to improve, and the European Central Bank remains likely to taper its quantitative easing program in 2017.


## Additional investment ideas


* **Buy US financials and health care**. With the Republican party in control of both the White House and Congress these sectors stand to benefit from lower regulatory risks. Financials could also get a boost if interest rates continue to move higher as the markets focus on the reflationary aspects of Trump's likely policies. Within health care, pharmaceuticals stand to benefit from a lower risk of drug price controls, and from the repatriation of overseas cash. We are overweight both sectors in our US equity sector strategy.
* **Buy US senior loans.** Expected fiscal stimulus from a Trump presidency should be positive for US economic growth, and boost US inflation. Both factors may lead to a steepening in US sovereign yield curves, which is a favorable development for floating-rate senior loans. The asset class has held its ground even through recent market turbulence, losing just 0.2% in the last bout of volatility. And specific loan issuers, especially in the energy and financial services sectors, may benefit from less stringent regulation. Senior loans form a core part of our Global Credit Opportunities portfolio, which offers the potential for recurring income in a low-yield investment environment without allocating to more volatile equity investments. US senior loans is one of our highlighted themes.
* **Buy infrastructure-related investments.** Mr. Trump has pledged to modernise the US' infrastructure throughout his campaign and reiterated his commitment to increasing infrastructure spending in his acceptance speech earlier today. This was also one of the few bipartisan issues during the election campaign, and comes at a time when the American Society of Civil Engineers estimates around a fifth of US roads are in poor or mediocre condition, and around 67,000 US bridges are structurally deficient. This suggests potential future benefits for investments exposed to higher fixed asset investment spending, provided Mr. Trump is able to implement his spending plans.
* **Buy cyber security stocks.** We expect the industry to get a further boost under Trump's presidency as he has repeatedly vowed to strengthen the cyber security infrastructure of both the US government and corporates. The cyber security allocation in the US federal budget has already increased from USD 12.6bn in fiscal year (FY) 2015 to USD 19bn in FY 2017. But we expect the broad-based momentum to continue, as we envisage tighter security regulations in the future. Cyber security is part of our broader Security and Safety Longer Term Investment theme.
* **Buy platinum and palladium.** Gold acted as a hedge in the immediate aftermath of a Trump victory, rallying 4.7%. We like platinum and palladium which stand to gain from safe-haven flows related to any future concerns around US policy or the Italian referendum, but are also supported by rising auto sales and industrial production. Industrially-oriented precious metals is a highlighted theme.
* **Sell Eurozone consumer discretionary companies.** 2017 consensus earnings estimates for the consumer discretionary (CD) sector appear too high in our view. And fear of increased protectionism is likely to dent the European automobile sector’s earnings prospects. A weaker US dollar against the euro would also hurt the luxury goods sector. We are underweight Eurozone consumer discretionary companies in our European sector allocation.",51

Funny how the media talks about how uneducated Americans were the deciding factor in the election. 
How can a country be proud of any president if it is is the uneducated that voted him or her in... 
If we apply trend analysis we can assertain that uneducated numbers are rising as is the wage gap, therefore it is fair to say that as the world further matures our species will attribute more and more power to those who do not have the correct knowledge to make descisions, in essence creating a deevolution of man. The 2008 financial crisis was due to mortgages hitting a default tipping point rate of 8% defaulting, the result was a complete global meltdown. 
I believe that history will see 2016 as the tipping point for education as we can clearly attribute both brexit and the Trump victory to uneducated individuals...

The biggest issue is there is no necessity to reform the system so it will be a slower recession of knowledge as opposed to a complete breakdown, nevertheless the 2016 tipping point was breached. 

Worst part or all this is the educated breed less than the uneducated... therefore there is worse to come in the future without global thought reform.",1

16-11-10,5c9b9t,The case for NTDOY (Nintendo),"Nintendo is releasing the NES Classic Edition on November 11th. All indications are that this will be one of the most popular items for the holiday season. Already supply looks to be very limited and well below demand.

I think this will have a spillover effect on NTDOY. It opens up more revenue streams for Nintendo - they could offer a ""Classic Edition II"" version with other games. They could offer a Super Nintendo version at a higher price point next year. Maybe this will push Nintendo into offering emulators through mobile devices.

I expect Nintendo stock to get a nice bump from this. Anyone disagree and want to tell me why I am wrong?",4

16-11-10,5c9h9n,Perpetual Option: Och-Ziff Capital Management Group (OZM),"In his book, You Can Be a Stock Market Genius, Greenblatt talks about using LEAPs to make leveraged bets.  The book included his trade in Wells Fargo (WFC, another topic for a future post, I suppose).

But sometimes, stocks get down so cheap that they become priced like options.  In the Genius book, the WFC LEAPs were priced at $14 while the stock was at around $77.

Here, we have a hedge fund manager trading less than $3.00/share, which is a typical price for regular options, not even LEAPs. Of course, all stocks are options on the residual value of businesses. But sometimes things are priced for either a large gain or zero, just like an option.

I call this a perpetual option, but that reminds me of those lifetime warranties.  Like, who's lifetime? The manufacturer's? The store's? Yours? Nothing is forever, so I guess there really is no such thing as a perpetual option.  But anyway...

Och-Ziff IPO'ed in 2007 at $32/share and traded in the mid $20's right before the crisis, then down to below $5.00 during the crisis and back up to the mid-teens.  I've been watching this since the IPO and looked at it again when it was trading around $10/share.  It's down quite a bit since then.  I didn't own it back then but I did take a small bite down at $5.00/share.

I have mentioned other private equity and hedge fund managers here in the past but haven't owned most of them because of the amount of money that seemed to be going into alternatives.  I was just worried that the AUM's of all of these alternative managers were going up so quickly that I couldn't imagine them earning the high returns that made everyone rush to them in the first place. Look at the presentation of any of these alternative managers and their AUM growth is just staggering.

Extremely Contrarian
We investors walk around and think about all sorts of things; look at store traffic, taste new foods/restaurant concepts, count how many Apple watches people are wearing (I recently biked around the city with my kid (Brooklyn to Central Park, around the park (around the big loop) and all the way downtown back to Brooklyn (30+ miles) and I think I counted two Apple watches that I saw compared to countless iPhones. And this was in the summer so no coats or long sleeves to hide wrists).

And a couple of the things that we tend to think about are,
What does everybody absolutely love, and what are they 100% sure of (other than that Hillary will win the election and that the market will crash if Trump wins), and 
What do people absolutely, 100% hate and don't even want to talk about? 
In the investing world right now, it seems like the one thing that everybody seems to agree with is that active investing is dead (OK, not completely true because we active investors never really lose faith in it).  The data points to it (active managers underperforming for many years, legendary stock pickers too not performing all too well, star hedge funds not doing well etc...).  The money flows point to it (cash flowing out of active managers and into passive funds, boom in index funds / ETFs; this reminds me of the 1990's when there were more mutual funds than listed companies.  There are probably more ETFs now than listed companies). Sentiment points to it (stars and heroes now are ETF managers, quants etc.).

By the Way
Oh, and by the way, in case people say that it is no longer possible due to this or that reason for humans to outperform indices or robots, I would just say that we have seen this before.  Things in finance are cyclical and we've seen this movie before.

From the 1985 Berkshire Hathaway Letter,
Most institutional investors in the early 1970s, on the other hand, regarded business value as of only minor relevance when they were deciding the prices at which they would buy or sell.  This now seems hard to believe.  However, these institutions were then under the spell of academics at prestigious business schools who were preaching newly-fashioned theory: the stock market was totally efficient, and therefore calculations of business value -- and even thought, itself -- were of no importance in investment activities.  (We are enormously indebted to those academics: what could be more advantageous in an intellectual contest -- whether it be bridge, chess or stock selection than to have opponents who have been taught that thinking is a waste of energy?)

What Do People Hate?
So, back to what people absolutely hate.  People hate active managers.  It's not even stocks that they are not interested in.  They hate active managers.  Nobody outperforms and their fees are not worth it. What else do they hate?  They hate hedge funds.  I don't need to write a list here, but you just keep reading one institution after another reducing their exposure to hedge funds. There is a massive shakeout going on now with money leaving hedge funds. Others like Blackstone argues that this is not true; assets are just moving out of mediocre hedge funds and moving into theirs.

This is a theme I will be going back to in later posts, but for now I am just going to look at OZM. 

OZM
OZM is a well-known hedge fund firm so I won't go into much detail here.  To me, it's sort of a conventional equity-oriented hedge fund that runs strategies very typical of pre-Volcker rule Wall Street investment banks; equity long/short, merger arb, convertible arb etc.  They have been expanding into credit and real estate with decent results.  But a lot of their AUM is still in the conventional equity strategies.

What makes OZM interesting now is that chart from the Pzena Investment report (see here). These charts make it obvious why active managers have had such a hard time.  The value spread has just continued to widen since 2004/2005 through now.  Cheap stocks get cheaper and expensive stocks get more so. You can see how this sort of environment could be the worst for long/short strategies (and value-oriented long strategies, and even naked short strategies for that matter).  Things have just been going the wrong way with no mean reversion.

But if you look at where those charts are now, you can see that it is probably exactly the wrong time to give up on value strategies or value-based long/short strategies; in fact it looks like the best time ever to be looking at these strategies.

Seeing that, does it surprise me that many pension funds are running the other way? Not at all.  Many large institutions chase performance and not future potential.

Conceptually speaking, they would rather buy a stock at 80x P/E that has gone up 30%/year in the past five years that is about to tank rather than buy an 8x P/E stock that has gone nowhere in the past five years but is about to take off; they are driven by historic (or recent historic) performance.

OZM Performance
Anyway, let's look at the long term performance of OZM. This excludes their credit and real estate funds which are doing much better and are growing AUM. 

This is their performance since 1994 through the end of 2015:

OZM fund	S&amp;P500
1994	28.50%	5.30%
1995	23.50%	27.40%
1996	27.40%	23.00%
1997	26.70%	33.40%
1998	11.10%	28.60%
1999	18.80%	21.00%
2000	20.60%	-9.10%
2001	6.30%	-11.90%
2002	-1.60%	-22.10%
2003	24.00%	28.70%
2004	11.10%	10.90%
2005	8.80%	4.90%
2006	14.80%	15.80%
2007	11.50%	5.50%
2008	-15.90%	-37.00%
2009	23.10%	26.50%
2010	8.50%	15.10%
2011	-0.50%	2.10%
2012	11.60%	16.00%
2013	13.90%	32.40%
2014	5.50%	13.70%
2015	-0.40%	1.40%
5 year avg	5.85%	12.57%
10 year avg	6.69%	7.32%
Since 1994	12.05%	8.87%
Since 2000	7.59%	5.01%
Since 2007	5.14%	6.53%

So they have not been doing too well, but it's really only the last couple of years that don't look too good.  Their ten-year return through 2013 was +8.2%/year versus +7.4%/year for the S&amp;P 500 index. It's pretty obvious that their alpha has been declining over time.

For those who want more up-to-date figures, I redid the above table to include figures through September-end 2016.  And instead of 5 year and 10 year returns, I use 4.75-year and 9.75-year returns; I thought that would be more comparable than saying 5.75-year and 10.75-year, and I didn't want to dig into quarterly figures to get actual 5 and 10s.


OZM fund	S&amp;P500
1994	28.50%	5.30%
1995	23.50%	27.40%
1996	27.40%	23.00%
1997	26.70%	33.40%
1998	11.10%	28.60%
1999	18.80%	21.00%
2000	20.60%	-9.10%
2001	6.30%	-11.90%
2002	-1.60%	-22.10%
2003	24.00%	28.70%
2004	11.10%	10.90%
2005	8.80%	4.90%
2006	14.80%	15.80%
2007	11.50%	5.50%
2008	-15.90%	-37.00%
2009	23.10%	26.50%
2010	8.50%	15.10%
2011	-0.50%	2.10%
2012	11.60%	16.00%
2013	13.90%	32.40%
2014	5.50%	13.70%
2015	-0.40%	1.40%
2016*	1.10%	7.80%
4.75 year	6.53%	14.58%
9.75 year	5.48%	6.72%
Since 1994	11.68%	8.92%
Since 2000	7.29%	5.27%
Since 2007	4.82%	6.86%

So over time, they have good outperformance, but much of that is from the early years.  As they get bigger, it's not hard to see why their spread would shrink.

They are seriously underperforming in the 4.75 year, but that's because the S&amp;P 500 index was coming off of a big bear market low and OZM didn't lose that much money, so I think that is irrelevant, especially for a long/short fund.

More relevant would be figures from recent market peaks which sort of shows a through-the-cycle performance.  Since the market peak in 2000, OZM has outperformed with a gain of +7.3%/year versus +5.3%/year for the S&amp;P, but they have underperformed since the 2007 peak.  A lot of this probably has to do with the previous charts about how value spreads have widened throughout this period.

I would actually want to be increasing exposure to this area that hasn't worked well since 2007.  Some of this, of course, is due to lower interest rates.  Merger arb, for example, is highly dependent on interest rates as are other arbitrage type trades. (The less risk there is, the closer to the short term interest rate the return is going to be.)

One thing that makes me scratch my head, though, in the 3Q 2016 10-Q is the following:
OZ Master Fund’s merger arbitrage, convertible and derivative arbitrage, corporate credit and structured credit strategies have each generated strong year-to-date gains through September 30, 2016. In merger arbitrage, certain transactions in which OZ Master Fund participated closed during the third quarter, contributing to the strategy’s year-to-date gross return of +1.3%. Convertible and derivative arbitrage generated a gross return of +0.5% during the third quarter, driven by gains in convertible arbitrage positions, commodity-related volatility, commodity spreads and index volatility spread trades. Year-to-date, convertible and derivative arbitrage has generated a gross return of +1.3%. In OZ Master Fund’s credit-related strategies, widening credit spreads and certain event-driven situations added +0.4% to the gross return within corporate credit during the third quarter, while in structured credit, a +0.9% gross return during the quarter was attributable to the realization of recoveries in certain of our idiosyncratic situations. Year-to-date, the corporate credit and structured credit strategies are each up +1.2% on a gross basis.
Gross returns of less than 2% are described as ""strong"".  Hmm... I may be missing something here.  Maybe it is 'strong' versus comparable strategies.  I don't know. Anyway, moving on...

Greenblatt Genius Strategies
Oh yeah, and by the way, OZM is one of the funds that are heavily into the yellow book strategies. Here's a description of their equity long/short strategy:
Long/short equity special situations, which consists of fundamental long/short and event-driven investing. Fundamental long/short investing involves analyzing companies and assets to profit where we believe mispricing or undervaluation exists. Event-driven investing attempts to realize gain from corporate events such as spin-offs, recapitalizations and other corporate restructurings, whether company specific or due to industry or economic conditions.



This is still a large part of their book, which is a good thing if you believe that the valuation spreads will mean revert and that Greenblatt's yellow book strategies are still valid.

One thing that may temper returns over time, though, is the AUM level.  What you can do with $1 billion in AUM is not the same as when you have $10 billion or $30 billion.  I don't think Greenblatt would have had such high returns if he let AUM grow too much.

This seems to be an issue with a lot of hedge funds. Many of the old stars who were able to make insane returns with AUM under $1 billion seem to have much lower returns above that level.

Here is OZM's AUM trend in the past ten years.  Some of the lower return may correlate to the higher AUM, not to mention higher AUM at other hedge funds too reducing spreads (and potential profits).




Just to refresh my memory, I grabbed the AUM chart from the OZM prospectus in 2007.  Their AUM was under $6 billion until the end of 2003 and then really grew to over $30 billion by 2007.



Their 10-year return through 2003 was 18%/year vs. 10.6%/year for the S&amp;P 500 index.

From the end of 2003 through the end of 2015, OZM's funds returned +7.2%/year versus +7.4%/year for the S&amp;P 500 index. So their alpha basically went from 7.4%/year outperformance to flat.

This is actually not so bad as these types of funds often offered 'equity-like' returns with lower volatility and drawdowns.  The long/short nature of OZM funds means that investors achieved the same returns as the S&amp;P 500 index without the full downside exposure. This is exactly what many institutions want, actually.

But still, did their growth in AUM dampen returns?  I think there is no doubt about that. These charts showing tremendous AUM growth is the reason why I never owned much of these alternative managers in the past few years I've been watching them. 

The question is how much of the lower returns are due to the higher AUM. Of course, some of this AUM growth is in other strategies so not all new AUM is squeezed into the same strategies.

Will OZM ever go back to the returns of the 1990's?  I doubt that.  First of all, that was a tremendous bull market.  Plus, OZM's AUM was much smaller so they had more opportunities to take advantage of yellow book ideas and other strategies.

Boom/Bubble Doesn't Mean It's a Bad Idea
By the way, another sort of tangent.  Just because there is a big boom or bubble in something doesn't necessarily make that 'something' a bad idea.  We had a stock market bubble in the late 1920's that ended badly, but owning parts of businesses never suddenly became a bad idea or anything.  It's just that you didn't want to overpay, or buy stocks for the wrong reasons.

We had a boom in the late 1990's in stocks that focused on picking stocks and owning them for the long term as exemplified by the Beardstown Ladies. Of course, the Beardstown Ladies didn't end well (basically a fraud), but owning good stocks for the long haul, I don't think, ever became a bad idea necessarily.

We had a tremendous housing bubble and various real estate bubbles in recent years. But again, owning good, solid assets at reasonable prices for the long haul never became a bad idea despite the occasional bubbles and collapses.

Similarly, hedge funds and alternative assets go through cycles too. I know many value investors are not with me here and will always hate hedge funds (like Buffett), but that's OK. 

We've had alternative cycles in the past.  Usually the pattern is that there is a bull market in stocks and people rush into stocks. The bull market inevitably ends and people lose money. Institutions not wanting to lose money rush into 'alternative' assets.  Eventually, the market turns and they rush back into equities.

I think something similar is happening now, but the cycle seems a bit elongated and, and the low interest rates is having an effect as alternatives are now attracting capital formerly allocated to fixed income. In the past, alternatives seemed more like an equity substitution, risk asset.

Valuation
OK, so what is OZM worth?

Well, a simple way of looking at it is that OZM has paid an average of $1.10/year in dividends in the last five years.   During the past five years, the funds returned around 6%/year, so it's not an upside outlier in terms of fund performance.

Put a 10x multiple on it and the stock is worth $11/share.

Another way to look at it is that the market is telling you that it is unlikely that OZM will enjoy the success even of the past five years over the next few years.  Assuming a scenario of failure (stock price = 0) or back to sort of past five years performance ($11), a $3.00 stock price reflects the odds of failure at 73% and only a 27% chance that OZM gets back to it's past five year average-like performance. Of course, OZM can just sort of keep doing what it's doing and stay at $3.00 for a long time too.

There is a problem with this, though, as the dividends don't reflect equity-based compensation expense; OZM gives out a bunch of RSU's every year.

To adjust for this, let's look at the economic earnings of the past five years including the costs of equity-based compensation.

Equity-based compensation expense not included in economic income is listed below ($000):

2008	102,025
2009	122,461
2010	128,737
2011	128,916
2012	86,006
2013	120,125
2014	104,344
2015	106,565

It's odd that this doesn't seem to correlate to revenues, income or AUM; it's just basically flat all the way through.

If we include this, economic income at OZM averaged around $520 million/year.  With fully diluted 520 million shares outstanding, that's around $1.00/share in economic earnings per share that OZM earned on average over the past five years.  So that's not too far off from the $1.10/share dividends we used above.

One of the interesting things about investing is when you find alternative ways to value something instead of just the usual price-to-book values, P/E ratios etc.

So how would you value this?

What about adjusting the implied odds from the above. What if we said there's a 50/50 chance of recovery or failure.  Let's say recovery is getting back to what it has done over the past five years on average, and failure is a zero on the stock.

50% x $0.00 + 50% x $10.00 = $5.00/share

In that case, OZM is worth $5.00/share, or 70% higher than the current price.   You are looking at a 60 cent dollar in that case.

Let's say there is a 70% chance of recovery.

70% x $10.00 + 30% x $0.00 = $7.00/share.

That's 130% higher, or a 40 cent dollar.

By the way, the AUM averaged around $37 billion over the past five years, and remember, their return was around 5.9%/year so these figures aren't based on huge, abnormal returns or anything.

As of the end of September 2016, AUM was $39.3 billion, and this went down to $37 billion as of November 1, 2016. OZM expects continued redemptions towards year-end both due to their Justice Department/SEC settlement and overall industry redemption trends.

The above ignored balance sheet items, but you can deduct $0.60/share, maybe, of negative equity, or more if you think they need more cash on the balance sheet to run their business.

Preferred Shares
As for the $400 million settlement amount and preferred shares, the settlement amount is already on the balance sheet as a liability (which was paid out after the September quarter-end).  The preferred shares were sold after the quarter ended.  They have zero interest for three years so I don't think it impacts the above analysis.  You would just add cash on the balance sheet and the preferreds on the liability side.

If you want to deduct the full amount of the settlement of $400 million, you can knock off $0.77/share off the above valuation instead of the $0.60/share.

Earnings Model
The problem with these companies is that it's impossible, really, to predict what their AUM is going to be in the future or their performance.  Of course, we can guess that if they do well, AUM will increase and vice-versa.

But still, as a sanity check, we should see how things look with various assumptions in terms of valuation.

First of all, let's look at 2015.  In the full year to 2015, a year that the OZM funds were down (master fund), they paid a dividend of $0.87.  Adjusted economic income was $240 million (economic income reported by OZM less equity-based comp expense) and using the current fully diluted shares outstanding of 520 million, that comes to $0.46/share. OK, it's funny to use current shares outstanding against last year's economic income, but I am trying to use last years' earnings as sort of a 'normalized' figure.

Using these figures from a bad year, OZM is current trading at a 29% dividend yield (using $3.00/share price) and 6.5x adjusted economic income. This would be 8.3x if you added the $0.77/share from the settlement above.

OK, so average AUM was $44 billion in 2015, so even in a bad year, they made tons in management fees.  Fine.  We'll get to that in a second.  AUM is $37 billion as of November 2016, and is probably headed down towards year-end.

2016 Year-to-Date
So let's look at how they are doing this year so far.  Fund performance-wise, it hasn't been too good, but they do remain profitable. These fund businesses are designed so that their fixed expenses are covered by their management fees.   Big bonuses are paid out only when the funds make money.

Anyway, let's look at 2016 so far in terms of economic income.

In the 3Q of 2016, economic income was $57.4 million. Equity-based compensation expense was $18.3 million so adjusted economic income was $39.1 million. Annualize that and you get $156 million. Using 520 million fully diluted shares (share amount used to calculate distributable earnings in the earnings press release), that comes to $0.30/share adjusted economic income.  So at $3.00/share, OZM is trading at 10x arguably depressed earnings.  (This excludes the  FCPA settlement amount). If you include $400 million of the FCPA preferreds (total to be offered eventually), then the P/E would actually be closer to 12.6x.

For the year to date, economic income was $195 million, and equity-based comp expense was $56 million so adjusted economic income was $139 million.  Again using 520 million shares, that comes to $0.25/share in adjusted economic earnings per share. Annualize that and you get $0.33/share.
So at $3.00/share, OZM is trading at 9x depressed earnings, or 11x including the FCPA preferred.

OK, so maybe this is not really 'depressed'.  With still a lot of AUM, it is possible that AUM keeps going down.

AUM was $37 billion in November, but let's say it goes down to $30 billion.  That's actually a big dip.  But let's say AUM goes down there.  And then let's assume 1% management fees, 20% incentive fees, and economic income margin of 50% (averaged 56% in past five years) and the OZM master fund return of 5%.

In this case, economic income would be $300 million.  Equity-based comp costs seems steady at around $100 million, so we deduct that to get adjusted economic income.  This comes to $200 million.

That comes to around $0.40/share. At $3.00/share, that's 7.5x adjusted economic earnings, or a 13% yield, or 9.4x and 10.6% yield including the FCPA preferreds.

So that's not bad.  We are assuming AUM dips to $30 billion and OZM funds only earn 5%/year, and with that assumption the stock is trading at this cheap level.

Things, of course, can get much worse. If performance doesn't improve, AUM will keep going down.  You can't really stress test these things as you can just say their returns will never recover and that's that.

On the other hand, any improvement can get you considerable upside.

If assets return to $40 billion and returns average 6% over time, economic income margin goes to 56% (average of past five years), adjust economic income per share is $0.76/share and the stock could be worth $7.60/share for more than a double.

Here's a matrix of possibilities.  Skeptics will say, where are the returns below 5% and AUM below $30 billion?!

Well, OK. If returns persist at lower than 5%, it's safe to assume that AUM will go down and this may well end up a zero.  That is certainly a possibility.  It wouldn't shock many for another hedge fund to shut down.

On the other hand, if things do stabilize, normalize and OZM recovers and does well, there is a lot of upside here. What is interesting to me is that the market is discounting a lot of bad and not pricing in much good.  This is when opportunities occur, right?



5%	6%	7%	8%	9%	10%
30,000	$0.45	$0.52	$0.58	$0.65	$0.71	$0.78
35,000	$0.56	$0.64	$0.71	$0.79	$0.86	$0.94
40,000	$0.67	$0.76	$0.84	$0.93	$1.01	$1.10
45,000	$0.78	$0.87	$0.97	$1.07	$1.16	$1.26
50,000	$0.88	$0.99	$1.10	$1.21	$1.32	$1.42
55,000	$0.99	$1.11	$1.23	$1.35	$1.47	$1.58
60,000	$1.10	$1.23	$1.36	$1.49	$1.62	$1.75


The row above is the assumed return of the OZM funds.  The left column is the AUM.  Assumptions are 1% management fee, 20% incentive fee, 56% economic income margin (excluding equity-based comp expense) and $100 million/year in equity-based comp expense.

It shows you that it doesn't take much for adjusted economic income per share to get back up to closer to $1.00, and can maintain $0.45/share even in a $30 billion AUM and 5% return scenario making the current stock price cheap even under that scenario.

Conclusion
Having said all that, there is still a lot of risk here.  Low returns and low bonuses can easily make it hard for OZM to keep their best people.  But if their best people perform, I assume they do get paid directly for their performance so that shouldn't be too much of an issue.

A lot of the lower returns in recent years is no doubt due to their higher AUM.  But it is also probably due to crowding of the hedge fund world and low interest rates leading to an overall lower return environment for all.

If you think these things are highly cyclical, then you can expect interest rates to normalize at some point.  Money flowing out of hedge funds should also be good for future returns in these strategies.  The part of lower returns at OZM due to higher AUM may not reverse itself, though, if OZM succeeds in maintaining and increasing AUM over time.

But even without the blowout, high returns of the 1990's, OZM can make decent returns over time as seen in the above table.

In any case, unlike a few years ago, the stock prices of many alternative managers are cheap (and I demonstrated how cheap OZM might be here) and institutional money seems to be flowing out of these strategies.

So:
OZM is cheap and is in a seemingly universally hated industry 
Money is flowing out of these strategies, particularly performance chasing institutions (that you would often want to fade)
there is a bear market in active managers and bubble in indexing (which may actually increase opportunities for active managers)
value spreads are wide and has been widening for years making mean reversion overdue
etc.
These things make OZM a compelling play on these various themes. 

I would treat this more like an option, though.  Buy it like you would buy an option, not like you would invest in, say, a Berkshire Hathaway. 

There are a lot of paths here to make good money, but there are also plenty of ways to lose. If you look at this like a binary option, it can be pretty interesting!

Gotham's New Fund
Joel Greenblatt was in Barron's recently.  He is one of my favorite investors so maybe it's a good time for another post. 

Anyway, this new fund is kind of interesting as I am sort of a tinkerer;  this is like the product of some financial tinkering.  I don't know if it's the right product for many, but we'll take a look.

But first, let's see what he has to say about the stock market in general.

The Market
Greenblatt says that the market is ""expensive"".  The market is in the 21st percentile of expensive in the past 25 years. Either a typo or he misspoke, he is quoted as saying that the market has been more expensive 79% of the time in the past 25 years.  Of course, he means the market has been cheaper 79% of the time. 

The year forward expected return from this price level is between 2% to 7%, so he figures it averages out to 4% to 6% per year.  In the past 25 years, the market has returned 9% to 10%/year so he figures the market is 12% to 13% more expensive than it used to be.

He says:
Well, one scenario could be that it drops 12% to 13% tomorrow and future returns would go back to 9% to 10%.  Or you could underearn for three years at 4% to 6%.  We're still expecting positive returns, just more muted. The intelligent strategy is to buy the cheapest things you can find and short the most expensive.  

But...
Immediately, bears will say that this 25 year history is based during a period when interest rates went down.  The 10 year bond rate was around 8% back in 1991, and is now 1.8%.  In terms of valuation, this would have pushed up asset values by 6.2%/year ($1.00 discounted at 8%/year then and $1.00 discounted by 1.8% now).

Declining rates were certainly a factor in stock returns over the past 25 years.  Of course, the stock market didn't keep going up as rates kept going down.  The P/E ratio of the S&amp;P 500 index at the end of 1990 was around 15x, and now it's 25x according to Shiller's database (raw P/E, not CAPE).   So the valuation gain over the 25 years accounted for around 2%/year of the 9-10% return Greenblatt states.

Here are the EPS estimates for the S&amp;P 500 index according to Goldman Sachs:

          EPS     P/E
2016  $105    20.4x
2017  $116    18.5x
2018  $122    17.6x

Earnings estimates are not all that reliable (estimates have been coming down consistently in the past year or so).  But since most of 2016 is done, I suppose the $105 figure should be OK to use.

I don't know if it's apples to apples (reported versus operating etc.), but if we assume the 'current' P/E of the market is 20x, then the valuation tailwind accounted for 1.2%/year of the 9-10%.  But then of course, even if this was a fair comparison, there is still the aspect of lower interest rates boosting the economy by borrowing future demand (and therefore overstating historical earnings).

In any case, one of the main bearish arguments is that this interest rate tailwind in the past will become a headwind going forward.  Just about everyone agrees with that. 

But as I have mentioned before, calling turns in interest rates is very hard, Japan being a great example.  If you look at interest rates over the past 100 years or more, you see that major turns in trend don't happen all that often; it's been a single trend of declining rates since the 1980/81 peak, basically.  What are the chances that you are going to call the next big turn correctly?  I would bet against anyone trying.  OK, that didn't come out right.  I wouldn't necessarily be long the bond market either.

Gotham Index Plus
So, back to the topic of Gotham's new fund.  It is a fascinating idea. The fund will go long the S&amp;P 500 index, 100% long, and then overlay a 90%/90% long/short portfolio of the S&amp;P 500 stocks based on their valuations.

The built-in leverage alone makes this sort of interesting. Many institutions may have an allocation to the S&amp;P 500 index, and then some allocation to long/short equity hedge funds.  The return of the Gotham Index plus would be much higher (when things go well).

I think this sort of thing was popular at some point in the pension world; index plus alpha etc.  Except I think a lot of those were institutions replacing their S&amp;P 500 index portfolios with futures positions, and then using the cash raised to buy mortgage securities.  Of course, when things turned bad, oops; they took big hits in S&amp;P 500 futures, tried to post cash for the margin call and realized that their mortgage funds weren't liquid  (and was worth a lot less than they thought).

Or something like that.

There is risk here too, of course.  You are overlaying two risk positions on top of each other. When things turn bad, things can certainly get ugly.

I think Greenblatt's calculation is that when things turn bad, the long/short usually does well.  I haven't seen any backtests or anything, so I don't know what the odds of a blowup are.

Expensive stocks tend to be high-beta stocks and cheaper stocks may be lower beta, so in a market correction, the high-beta, expensive names may go down a lot harder.

To some extent, lower valuations may reflect more cyclicality, lower credit risk / lower balance sheet quality too so you have to be a little careful. In a financial crisis-like situation, lower valuation (lower credit quality) can tank and some higher valuation names may hold up (like the FANG-like stocks).

But Greenblatt's screen is not just raw P/E or P/B, but is tied to return on capital, so maybe this is not as much of an issue compared to a pure P/B model.

The argument for this structure is that people can't stay with a strategy if it can't keep up with the market.  Here, the market return is built in from the beginning and you just hope for the ""Plus"" part to kick in. In a long/short portfolio, the beta is netted out to a large extent so can lower potential returns.  This fixes that.  But there is a cost to that.

In any case, I do think it's a really interesting product, but keep in mind that it is a little riskier than Gotham's other offerings.

Oh, and go read the article on why this new fund is a good idea.  Greenblatt is always a great read.

Chipotle (CMG)
Well, Chipotle earnings came out and it was predictably horrible.  The stock is not cheap so it hasn't been recommendable in a while, but I really like the company.  There was a really long article on them recently which was a great read.  It didn't really change my view of them all that much.  I think they will get a lot of business back, eventually.

The earnings call was OK, but what was depressing about it was that they decided to ditch  Shophouse.  I don't think any analysts asked about it so it was a given, I guess.  I had it a couple of times in DC and liked it and was looking forward to it in NY, but I guess that's not going to happen.  As an investor, that was not baked into the cake, I don't think, even though there was probably some hope that the CMG brand can be extended into other categories.

This puts a lot of doubt into that idea.  Someone said that brand extensions in restaurants/retail never work, and that has proven to be the case here.  I wouldn't get too excited about pizza and burgers either.  Burgers are really crowded now and will only get more so.

If CMG has to look to Europe for growth, that is not so great either as the record of U.S. companies expanding into Europe is not good.  I would not count on Europe growth.

Anyway, this doesn't mean it's all over for CMG. I think they will come back, but there are some serious headwinds now other than their food poisoning problem; more competition etc.  They were the only game in town for a while, but now everyone seemingly wants to become the next Chipotle, so there are a lot of options out there now. 

As for Ackman's interest in CMG, I have no idea what his plan is.  There is no real estate here as CMG rents all their restaurants, and their restaurants had high 20's operating margins at their peak.  I don't know if they will ever get back up there, but it's not like these guys don't know how to run an efficient operation.  Maybe Ackman sees SGA opportunities, but pre-crisis, SGA was less than 7%, so there wouldn't be that much of a boost from cutting SGA. Or maybe he thinks it's time for CMG to do what everyone else is doing and go for the franchise model.  Who knows?  I look forward to seeing what his thoughts are; hopefully some 500 page presentation pops up somewhere...

McDonalds
I don't want to turn this into a food blog, but I can't resist mentioning this.  I have been a lifelong MCD customer; I have no problem with it.  OK, it may not be my first choice of a meal in most cases, but it's fine.  And when you have a kid, you tend to go more often that you'd like.  But still, it's OK. It is what it is, right?

I like the remodelling that they are doing, and the fact that they have free wifi is great too.
But here's a big clustermuck they had with their recent custom burger and kiosk idea.  I walked into a MCD without knowing anything about any of this recently.  A lady said I can order at the kiosk and I said, no, I'll just go to the counter, thank you.

And I waited 10 minutes or so in line, looking up at the tasty looking special hamburgers on the HD, LCD menu board.  It was finally my turn at the cash register and I said I want that tasty looking hamburger up there on the screen.  And the lady said, oh, you can only order that at the kiosk. I was like, huh?  That was really annoying.  So I wait all this time and I can't get what I want; I have to walk all the way back and get in another line again? Come on!  At that point, I didn't want any other burger so I just ordered a salad (and the usual for my kid).

OK, so it's my fault, probably.  User error.  But as a service company, as far as I'm concerned, that was a massive fail on the part of MCD.

OK, Now That I started... 
And by the way, since I got myself started, let me get these two out too.  Yes, I spend too much time at fast food joints.  Guilty.  But still, here are my two peeves related to two of my favorite fast casual places: 

Shake Shack:   Being dragged there all the time, I have learned to love the Shack-cago hot dog. Chicken Shack is awesome too, in case you don't want to eat hamburgers all the time. But I can't tell you how often they get take-out and stay wrong.  I had a long run where they didn't get it right at all and had to ask for things to be packed to go.  It is really annoying and wastes everyone's time. 

Chipotle:  This hasn't happened to me the last couple of times, but this is the usual conversation that happens to me just about every time I go to Chipotle.

CMG: ""Hi, what can we get you today?"" (or some such)
Me: ""Um, I'll have a burrito...""
CMG: putting the tortilla in the tortilla warmer/cooker, ""and would you like white rice or brown rice?
Me: ""White rice is fine""
CMG: with tortilla still in the cooker, ""and black beans or pinto beans?""
Me: ""black beans"".
CMG: laying a sheet of aluminum foil on the counter and placing the tortilla on it, moving over to the rice area, ""Was that white rice or brown rice?""
Me: ""white rice""
CMG: sliding over to the beans, ""and black beans or pinto beans?"".
Me: ""black"".

I can't tell you how many times this exact thing happened to me.  If you can't remember what I say, don't ask beforehand!  Just ask when we get to whatever you are going to ask me about!  This is not rocket science, lol...  Incredibly annoying.

Anyway, I still love CMG and will keep eating there.

Oh, and to make things interesting, I decided to post a contact email address in the ""about"" section of the blog.  I will try to respond to every email, but keep in mind I may not look in that email box all the time. 

I will try to post more, though.

*FIRST, I will announce my intention to renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205.*



*SECOND, I will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.*


*THIRD, I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator.*


*FOURTH, I will direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately.*

*FIFTH, I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars' worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.*

*SIXTH, lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward.*

*SEVENTH, cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs and use the money to fix America's water and environmental infrastructure.*

*A) End The Offshoring Act. Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free.*


*B) American Energy &amp; Infrastructure Act. Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years. It is revenue neutral.*


*C) Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act. Fully repeals Obamacare and replaces it with Health Savings Accounts, the ability to purchase health insurance across state lines, and lets states manage Medicaid funds. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications.*

16-11-10,5c9r1f,"Need a hand starting to invest in S&amp;P500","Hi all, Ive done a bit of homework and it seems like the s&amp;p 500 gives good returns for a retirement type account (like 20+ yrs) since its averaged a return of 10% or so per year since the 70s.

So thats basically my goal, to be putting money into the s&amp;p500 to retire on one day.

What Ive done so far is created an account with Vanguard, and started a traditional IRA and put $1000 in it... and thats where I got stuck. I couldnt figure out how to buy into the s&amp;p500 itself. When I searched that on the website, about 5 different options popped up like small cap, mid cap, growth, value.. I dont know what any of this means. And there was one thing called index 500 but Im not sure how that is related. How can I tell which to buy? And is it possible to setup a recurring monthly but of $X amount each month? Or is it better to watch the prices and do the whole dollar cost averaging thing?

I also have a basic question about investments and IRAs, say I take 1000 from my bank and give it to vanguard .. what happens to that 1000? Does it go into my IRA, then they use whatever money is in the IRA and invest it, giving back any returns, taking out their fees, etc? Or do they invest it first, and then later put it into my account?

And finally, a goal I have is to be putting 1000 away into the s&amp;p500 per month, I cant do that right now, but thats why its  a goal. An IRA can only take 5500 a year, so how do I get that other 6500? Create another IRA?

16-11-10,5c71qw,"What's going on right now.","I've been saying for nearly a year now - that r/investing is having trouble concentrating on what the goal of investing is. Money.
 

The debate about active vs passive carries on with no sign of stopping. The stock hyping is worse than ever and at the end of the day people are getting bad advice from armchair investors with a few thousand in a mutual.

Some of you might have noticed today's rally after the election lurched unexpected at Trump. I've been appalled to see people here buying based on what they want to believe - rather than what's actually happening. 
What's actually happening: there are less than no fundamentals in play. Nobody I've spoken with has so much as called their broker. A chap I met a few weeks ago told me that in 24 hours there has been exactly 1 trade coming out of his office, a large institutional. **Nobody** knows whether or not Trump is going to be a good thing for the US economy just yet; if you think he is then that's *opinion* folks, not what you should be trading on.

To highlight this problem you need to stop looking at the numbers and start looking at where this capital is coming from. SolarCity, a company I know many of you are passionate about, is going under. $114m in the door last year. Wait, no, that's actually $14m. One hundred million dollars in 'solar bonds' which, given the uncertainty around energy policy, is evaporating like cats piss off a hot tin roof. 

To be a halfway profitable investor you need to be able to look at the maket as it is, rather than what you want it to be. The reality is there are companies I know many of you are passionate about, you need to be able to cut off the slack. The reality is also we all want a Trump presidency to result in a strong US economy, you need to be able to see that we just don't know yet. 

The market rally today is vastly irrational, literally any idiot can see that. This is not remotely subjective. 
And yet.. there's people here howling that they're making vast wads of cash on this, and ""so where's the crash?""

16-11-10,5c7op5,Buy TMG. Thank me later.,"(SWEDISH STOCK)

The company is pretty new on the market. It had a peak at 9 euros, what happened to that? This is what's happened since in chronological order.

**1 August: Stock on ATH: 9.45 Euro**

**1 August: Acquisition of Augustus Group which increased EPS from 0,204 till 0.323 Eur, and number of subsidiaries from 11 to 14.**

**16 August: (Q2) Good report that shows better numbers than expected.**

**22 August: Acquisition of Vodrum that increases EPS to 0.354 Eur and number of subsidiaries to 17.**

**26 September: Acquisition of TDA Group that increases EPS to 0.3652 Eur and number of subsidiaries to 19**

**2 November : The group is reinforced with experienced Adam Graham as CEO. Jeremy Harbour keeps his role as chairman.**


Now, why would the company get back to the 9 euros soon?
The company is extremely undervalued. TMG has a considerably higher growth than rivals with P/E's of around 30-32 and deserves to be traded at a multipel than that. A course over 10 euros is easy to motivate.

There's almost zero to none risk in investing in the near future as both the company itself and the subsidiaries are profitable and debt-free. You should be focusing on when the first dividends arrive. (I'm betting on that they will arrive somewhere between January - March as the cashflow will increase by immense measures due to a €51m pipeline from the new CEO.

-  Local opportunities due to possibly fewer small business regulations.
-  Some nuclear and some coal opportunities - on the coal, mostly the *recent* underdogs.  This one is very pertinent, especially on the coal point.
-  Commodities.  I remain bullish on commodities and will continue to be so in general - the election would have changed nothing.  Fiat has no limits; commodities do.  The end.
-  Very bullish Russia.  My Russia bets over the last two years are up big against the S&amp;P 500 and the recent news is even more positive toward Russia.  Buying Russian companies at PE ratios of 1 and 2 was like free money in 2014-2015.

Note - this is just my take and regardless of how the election would have gone, I would have been looking at various investment themes (like I would have shorted the remaining coal companies in the US under Clinton).",2

16-11-10,5c7v2s,"Here's why $FNMA shot up 25% yesterday","Here is a recap of the story so far: The feds hired an accounting firm to audit the GSEs and then provided them with a bailout in exchange for total control. After the captive, Fortune 50 companies paid off their debt plus about an extra 100 billion, shareholders started to get anxious about ever seeing returns on their investments. Lawsuits and document releases reveal that the original terms of the bailout were fabricated (allegedly - the auditing firm settled out of court with a cash payment to shareholder). The companies were illegally nationalized to pad the outrageous budget of the last 8 years.

BUT WE ALL ALREADY KNEW THAT. Why did the commons shoot up 25% yesterday? Well with Trump becoming President, there are two possibilities that might actually happen:

1. Obama hurries to release the GSEs so that Trump doesn't get a free cash cow. Because of the time crunch his only option is to ""release and recap"" basically returning them to their original state.

2. The judges in the Perry Appeal rule that the FHFA and Treasury broke the law. If not. the court sets many dangerous precedents including the basic idea that the government can hire a crooked accounting firm to audit your company and then seize all profits forever. While still unlikely, it is far more possible now with the recent change in power.

What comes next? Judge Sweeney ordered the release of 56 out of 11,000 privileged documents. 4 of these 56 were sealed under Presidential Privilege. The feds delayed their delivery to Nov 9th and are now petitioning that all other lawsuits are barred from using these documents in their proceedings. 

So now we have to wait to see if those documents are kept sealed because they would cause irreparable damage to our economic and political systems.... or if they get released because they just embarrass some bureaucrats.

Cheatsheet presents consensus about how markets will react in either case. We know who won so only one column of this cheatsheet is relevant. Let's see how accurate were  the predictions. Quoted text is prediction.

**Stocks**

&gt; Negative with increased volatility especially rate sensitive stock. Longer term infastructure stocks doing good.

reality: huge stock rally, S&amp;P up 2%, DOW up. Infastructure stocks doing good.

what is not in prediction: technology companies going down, European banks gains, probably lots of other things. 

**US dollar**

&gt; Down vs developed currencies especially Swiss Frank, Jen, in flight to safety. Up against others especially emergent markets. Mexican peso biggest hit

reality: dollar up against yen and franc. Mexican peso really hit hard, at all time low.

**Us Treasuries** 

&gt; prices up, yields down

reality: price down, yields up. 

**commodities and equity**

&gt; very positive for gold and other safe haven. Anti-Iran rhetoric good for oil price, pro-coal stance bad for natural gas. Copper may rise.

reality: copper rising, coal up, oil up, gold down.

**Emerging markets**

&gt; bad except for Russia. Mexico, Southeast Asia, China most vulnerable. India and Indonesia less so.

reality: Russian stock exchange up, Mexican peso doing bad, I dont have time to check India or Indonesia.

**Conclusion**

So seems like they got most of predictions completely wrong. I bet many people read articles like this treat them pretty seriously and base their decision on them. Does this mean people who compiled this cheatsheet are stupid and I'm smart? Nope. People who created thee charts are probably much smarter than me or most of you. It means that market is totally unpredictable and it's impossible to time it. What I think is most interesting is how many things that brought biggest gains (e.g. European banks up, technology stock down) are completely missed from the picture. Did anyone actually predict that?",16

Thoughts, Comments, Questions, Concerns?","So, considering a lot of the consensus is that defense contractors may do pretty well under a Trump presidency, I've been trying to look for companies that have growth potential. I own LMT already so I'm looking to diversify my defense holdings. 

That's where RTN comes in.

Not only do I think that over the next 4-8 years Raytheons product business will grow, but I also think their cyber security services will have large growth as well. In my opinion it's the next big thing the USA will have to deal with as we get closer to quantum computing.

Also, fundamentally they look sound as well. The largest amount of debt they have due is in 2020 and that's about 1.5 billion (almost 30% of their total debt). With their FCF steadily growing every year even higher than that number (from 1.6 million in 2011 to 1.9 million last year) I don't think it will be hard for them to repay their debt. In addition, their Net Income has actually seemed to grow disroportionatly in favor of FCF, which I would think is an indicator that they are managing their money well and lowering costs. This is true even though they spent a decent amount of money to acquire Foreground Security, which plays into my ideas about their move towards the Cyber Security industry.

Ratio-wise:  
ROA is higher than the industry average  
ROE is almost double the industry average WHILE their LT Debt/Capital ratio remains only slightly above the industry  
Their tax rate has been slightly lower than average for the last couple years  
And their asset turnover is a little higher than the industry.

Tl;Dr I think a ton of good stuff is happening over at Raytheon and their last couple years indicate that management is a good job. I would love to hear your thoughts",3

UTX rallied the past couple of days because Trump won office, as ""fears"" around sequestering military spend under Hillary were shrugged off. That's only ~25% of total revenue though. Just FYI the F-35 program, for what it's worth, is a total disaster. Just a bunch of high-flying government executives sucking their own dicks to the sounds of a stationary take-off fighter jet, even if it's heavier and less stealthy than the existing F-15 it doesn't matter because HELICOPTER LANDINGS.

Here are some other issues:

+ P&amp;W is facing serious manufacturing issues of their new engine, and that is delaying the delivery of new AirBus planes, and a month or so ago Bernstein came out saying the issue is ""major."" That's 25% of revenue that is screwed for the next 18 months at least. And on yeah, TODAY it came out that business jet deliveries are down 15% year-over-year. Even further? Every airline in the world is trying to delay expanding capacity as air fares collapse due to economic cycles. That means that it's going to cost you much less to finally fly to Mexico and hang out with all those rapists, and that the airlines are going to make less money because of it, which leads to less engines being delivered.

+ 50% of the remaining revenue is from China, and includes HVACs and Elevators (Otis). Trump wants to label China a currency manipulator, and while we are already in talks on their currency exchange rate it is undeniable that the Yuan is going to fall further because 1) their economy is collapsing under its heavy debt load and 2) labeling a country a currency manipulator is bad for trade. This currency fall limits their purchasing power so that the next time you want a rim job from a Sars-infested Chinese dick ninja you'll be able to get two for the price of one if you pay in USD.

Net-net you've got something that has gained nothing in short-term revenue from Trump becoming president, that is actually experiencing deteriorating fundamentals because of him.

16-11-10,5c8dzo,What to Do When Your Stock Doesn’t Move,"There is a big difference between a 'dead money' stock and a 'melting ice cube.' You can afford to stay invested in a profitable business with a stagnant stock price

Sometimes stocks don’t move much.

I own a stock called George Risk Industries (RSKIA). I’ve owned it for – I think – a little over six years now. It’s done fine. It was more expensive at one point than it is now. But there has never been a catalyst with this stock. It has earned about what I expected it to earn each year. It’s paid a good dividend yield of 4% or 5% a year. And any earnings beyond that have just piled up in cash.

At the time I bought the stock, I think it was trading around $4.50 a share and had about $4.50 a share in cash and investments. Money in mutual funds. That sort of thing. So, you were getting the business for free. And it was a profitable business. It earned – or would earn, in normal times (not 2010) – maybe 40 cents a share.


Well, over the last six years, the stock has paid dividends. And the yield on the stock has been higher than the yield on a government bond would be. It has piled up maybe a little more cash. We are talking maybe $5 to $6 a share in cash and investments now. But that is largely the result of things like mutual funds going up in value.

So you’ve gotten your dividend. And the cash box part of the business – again, it’s not really cash (it’s investments) – has grown a bit along with the market. But you are still talking about a stock where the operating business is not selling for much of anything above the value of what the company has on its balance sheet. So, say the stock goes for $7.25 a share. Say the company has $5.50 to $6 a share in net cash and investments. Then the value the market puts on the business – which might be earning 40 cents pre-tax – is somewhere between $1.25 and $1.75. Less than 5 times pre-tax profits. I am using round figures. The stock is illiquid. It often moves in increments as big as 25 cents whenever there’s a trade. And then the fair market value of the investments obviously moves constantly. So the numbers are a little different with every 10-Q.

But, you see the situation. It hasn’t outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the six years I’ve owned it. Now, personally, I’m okay with that. The S&amp;P 500 was cheap to fairly valued from 2010 through about 2012. The last three years it’s been expensive. A lot more expensive than George Risk. So, I’ve never been tempted to sell the stock unless I found something better to buy. And I’ve yet to find something better to buy. And so I’ve held on. But, nothing much has happened with the stock for about six years.

So, are we talking about a value trap?

In this case, perhaps not. And that is because the stock is profitable. It is safe and it is profitable both. The operating business has always turned a profit. And the company has always had a ton of net cash and investments. Liabilities are close to nil. There’s no debt. So, it’s safe and profitable. Those are not the traits of a true value trap. The stock isn’t a melting ice cube. But, it can be dead money. How long is too long to wait for a position to work out?

This isn’t an issue you only have to worry about with illiquid stocks. I own a very liquid stock – Frost (NYSE:CFR) – that has something of the same issue. I was talking to someone who owns a lot of Frost shares in his portfolio (bought because I talked to him about that stock a year back) and he went on and on about how the stock had been doing the last couple months or so – where it was finally moving. So, I had to tell him: “That doesn’t mean anything. Ignore it. It’s just because of the Fed.” The stock moves a lot on short-term expectations of when exactly the Fed will raise rates.

Now, Frost is a very, very interest rate-sensitive bank. The two most interest rate-sensitive banks I know of are probably Frost and Bank of Hawaii (NYSE:BOH). They both are funded almost entirely by customer deposits. And they both pay very little interest on those deposits. Most importantly, they both have huge amounts of deposits per branch. So their operating expense (non-interest expense) as a percent of deposits is very low.

In a high interest rate environment, these banks would have much higher returns on equity than the average bank. In a near-zero environment, a lot of banks will all earn about a 10% ROE regardless of how valuable their deposit base is.

So buying Bank of Hawaii and Frost – and I do suggest you buy both if you don’t own them already – is a speculation on interest rates. But it’s not much of a speculation on when the Fed raises rates. What I mean by this is easier to explain if you think about the George Risk example. I bought George Risk in 2010 and still own the stock in 2016. Now, imagine I buy Frost stock this year and hold it as long as I’ve held George Risk. I’d still own the stock in 2022. So my speculation is on where the Fed Funds Rate will be in six years rather than six months. That’s my bet. But the stock doesn’t move based on the bet. Day to day, week to week, and month to month – Frost shares are reacting to where investors think the Fed will have rates in May of 2016, not November of 2022. They are thinking six months ahead, not six years ahead.

In this kind of situation, what should you do? Imagine you bought Frost a year or two ago. Unemployment was already quite low. You might have expected the Fed Funds Rate to be higher by now than it is. So you’ve been sitting there in disappointment – just waiting without a catalyst – for a year or two now. It can feel like the Fed will never raise rates.

I remember facing the same situation with oil prices. A few years back, I was talking to the co-writer of a newsletter I did about researching cruise line stocks. I wanted to research Carnival (NYSE:CCL) and Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) as possible stock picks. The reason for doing this was simple. Carnival and Royal Caribbean weren’t earning much. Their ROE was poor. But they were paying a lot for fuel. And when you looked at their results before fuel expenses – they hadn’t diminished the way their overall financial results appeared to. In other words, something the companies couldn’t control – oil prices – was causing their EPS to look worse now than it had in the past.

The next question was whether oil prices were “normal.” At this time, Brent was over $100 a barrel. That obviously wasn’t normal. It might be reasonable to do an analysis of a cruise line with $70 Brent as your assumed cost input. And it might be reasonable to do an analysis of a cruise line with $30 Brent as your assumed cost input. More than $100 a barrel made no sense. You could develop new sources of oil – people were in Texas and elsewhere in the U.S. – for much less than $100 a barrel. This was not difficult to see.

But there was a problem. Oil was – at that moment – priced above $100 a barrel. There was nothing in my investment case for Carnival and Royal Caribbean that would start benefitting shareholders till oil prices dropped. So, it was a speculation on oil prices. I had no problem with saying that $70 oil was reasonable and $100 oil was unreasonable. That was a speculation I was comfortable making. So, I suggested we do a report ignoring the fact that oil was $100 and using $70 as our cost input in the analysis. This is the Ben Graham approach. True earnings normalization. It made sense to me. But, my co-writer was reluctant. And I think subscribers would have been very, very reluctant to embrace the idea. Why? Because oil wasn’t $70 a barrel. It was more than $100 a barrel. How could you ignore that reality? How could you just fast forward to a future that is – as any future must be – speculative?

I think we can only invest for normal times. You may want to short Chipotle because you think same store sales will continue to decline. Another investor may want to buy Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) because he believes same-store sales will recover. The one thing that makes no sense is to take today’s sales and use today’s operating margin as normal. Either sales will decline, and the operating margin will get much, much worse. Or sales will improve, and the operating margin will recover to the kind of levels that were normal in the past. I have no opinion on Chipotle. Except I do have the opinion that looking at the stock’s 2016 sales and earnings makes no sense. Those figures are irrelevant. This isn’t a normal year for Chipotle.

When oil is $100 a barrel, I think you can say it is not a normal year for airlines, or cruise lines, or oil companies. And you can safely disregard the current year’s EPS. It doesn’t matter. The same is true for Frost and Bank of Hawaii. It doesn’t matter what they report in EPS for 2016. The Fed Funds Rate is much lower now than it will be in a normal year. So, we don’t need to pay attention to their earnings.

This approach might make sense to you. I hope it does. Because it’s the only approach that makes sense to me. Investing on the assumption that $100 oil or 0% interest rates or anything as abnormal as all that will last sounds odder to me than investing in a company that has never turned a profit. We – as value investors – don’t do that. But even we know that a growing company that has never turned a profit will – if its gross profit margin is sufficiently high – eventually generate profits at some future size. It is a theoretically sustainable trajectory. Oil at $100 a barrel or interest rates at 0% are not sustainable. But, we don’t know when these “bubbles” will burst – do we?

So, it is easy to think this way in the finding and buying stage. It is easy to believe in Frost before you buy Frost. It becomes harder if say you expect the Fed will raise rates in December and then they don’t. That would be a surprise, wouldn’t it? And it might cause some short-term problems for the stock. You’re a value investor – not a value trader. So, short-term problems aren’t a problem for you. But, what if the Fed doesn’t raise rates through all of 2017? How would you feel then? Would it feel like a short-term problem? Or would it feel like you had invested in a dead money stock?

There is nothing wrong with a dead money stock. There is something wrong with a melting ice cube. I have owned both. And there’s a big difference between say George Risk and Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:BKS). Barnes &amp; Noble was always going to have a declining business. I bought into it on the assumption that the free cash flow its stores were producing could be used to pay dividends, buy back stock or acquire an unrelated, non-print book business. It was also possible that Ron Burkle would win his proxy fight with Len Riggio. Burkle lost. And I sold the stock soon after that proxy vote. Why? Because Barnes &amp; Noble was doubling down on Nook. Unlike the retail stores, Nook wasn’t a shrinking business – it was a money-losing business. It burned cash. And so, the safety of my investment was at risk. This wasn’t a dead money investment. It was a melting ice cube. It was a value trap.

The right time to sell a melting ice cube is as soon as possible. The right time to sell a dead money stock is only when you find something better. A dead money stock is still cheap.

In the newsletter I used to write, we picked a stock called Breeze-Eastern (BZC). It was a small business. Three investment funds owned most of the company. Their positions were illiquid. They couldn’t easily sell out to the public. So, not surprisingly in hindsight, they sold out to a 100% control buyer. But, until that moment, Breeze-Eastern seemed to have no catalyst. When the deal was announced, it was no longer dead money. A few months earlier, the biggest question people asked us about Breeze-Eastern was, “What if nothing ever happens with the stock?” Then it turns out like George Risk.

Obviously, it is better to find a Breeze-Eastern than a George Risk. But it’s not always easy to know the difference between a Breeze-Eastern and a George Risk. It’s easy to know the difference between a George Risk and a Frost and a Barnes &amp; Noble. The risks are different. The risk of losing money should always be a top concern. The risk of having to wait six years and still not have much to show for your investment – that’s a risk value investors can afford to take.

The annuity is a Flexible Premium Annuity through Lincoln National and according to the paperwork we have it says tax status is deferred compensation.

1. Lump Sum (and this appears to be taxable)
2. Assume ownership (only available for spouses so not available to us)
3. i4LIFE, which appears to be a reinvestment/change in beneficiaries; the balance quoted today is below the minimum for this option)

16-11-11,5cbyso,"Alright, My first day of trading futures and i am down -$870. I need to go through my plan with someone and get some pointers.","Well the day started out great, just like the last 3 weeks of paper trading. I was up around $370. I was only looking for $500 per day and it wasn't even 11 am! Funny thing trailing stops, Apparently if you close out you (long) position with a market order, the trailing stop still hangs around. I did not know this. So I ended a position and then the trailing stop bought (which would normally have stopped me out.) in the opposite direct i wanted. BOOM $-125 down. Just like that. I come back to my computer to find I am _4125 and falling, so I close! the position!!! 
  
Of course as every other trader on here can understand and relate to, I get mad, so I start revenge trading, trying to scalp small positions.  just losing more and more until I finally say fuck it! short the stock and let it ride it out (which would have worked if I kept it there BTW.) ended up losing $350 on that one. Eventually I lost $1037. I got sick I was so stressed,. My girlfriend and I pooled this money together because I had been doing so well with paper money, we thought I could do this full time.  I mean honestly, I was pulling $500 a day with paper money. I couldn't even comprehend what that would mean if I could do it everyday. I was essentially on cloud 9.

I eventually got back to -$870 and Haven't traded since. not with real money anyway.  I can't right now, every time I enter a position, my heart starts pumping faster and faster, I get that little voice in my head that screams ""Get out of the Position!"" SO I have been trying to watch feel good movies and make myself feel better while critiquing my plan.

My plan is of course to trade with the trend, no matter how sweet that pull back or break out is looking. I will wait for stochastics to hit either above or below 80 or 20 respectively, then I will look at the MACD. figure out its direction. If it is going my direction I will then look at the chart and check resistance and support levels. how close is it to this resistance, or if it just broke the resistance level and closed above it. If this all aligns I will implement a 2 tick trailing stop with my order. meaning I will only lose $62.  once it starts going my direction, depending on the speed, I will close 2 ticks above my entry, I'm not looking for huge gains here, just small scalps. (I mean if you can do this 10 times in a day your looking at $600.)

So with that said, what are your thoughts? ",7

16-11-11,5cc28w,SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son Banks on Exponential Growth,"I am about to go out on very thin ice. I am a value investor, but I’ll probably get banned from the value community for what I am about to say: Current valuations don’t mean much for companies in industries that are entering an exponential growth phase. As I type this, I catch myself thinking that it sounds so “dot-commish,” but bear with me as I try to bring my statement into a more familiar value framework.

Wall Street hates SoftBank’s recent decision to purchase ARM Holdings for £24.3 billion ($32 billion) — at a whopping 48 times earnings! SoftBank is paying a 43 percent premium for an already richly priced stock, and it doesn’t have any synergies with the U.K.-based supplier of semiconductor intellectual property — there are no costs to cut or additional revenue to capture by adding ARM to its existing businesses. Masayoshi Son, SoftBank’s founder and CEO and the reason my firm owns SoftBank stock, is not liked today as a result of the deal. I heard this (understandable) reaction from a friend about Son and the ARM purchase: “a bored rich man who needs to spend because he has too much.”

To understand this acquisition, we need to come to terms with Son’s investment strategy and his mental models that have made him the richest person in Japan. Son is a master of exponential (nonlinear) thinking. Examine his past investments and you’ll find that he identifies industries about to go from high but linear growth into the exponential phase — where the rate of growth is accelerating.

Son has done this over and over again during the past 40 years. It started with PCs in the ’70s, when he built a software distribution business in Japan to capitalize on PC growth entering the accelerating phase. He saw the inflection point of Internet growth in the ’90s, bet on Yahoo and created Yahoo Japan (a joint venture with Yahoo).

In the early 2000s he saw e-commerce and the Internet taking off in China and purchased a stake in Alibaba, turning his $20 million investment into $60 billion today.[signinlocker]

Son had the insight that the wireless market, which was already growing nicely, was about to explode due to the popularity of smartphones. True story: He went to Steve Jobs with a drawing of an iPod with a superimposed dialing pad and asked him to make a smartphone. This was before Apple even announced plans for the iPhone.

More important, to capitalize on this realization he bought the worst-run wireless mobile carrier in Japan (a very unpopular move at the time) and transformed it into the best one — a huge source of SoftBank’s cash flow today.

In 2013, Son thought the growth rate of mobile games — which, again, were growing nicely — would accelerate as processing power and video capabilities got better and smartphone adoption increased. To take advantage of this impending trend, SoftBank paid $1.53 billion that year for 51 percent of Helsinki-based game maker Supercell (a $3 billion valuation). In 2015 it upped its stake to 73.2 percent before selling its entire position this year at more than three times the initial valuation.

[tweetshareinline tweet=""Identifying industries that are entering an exponential growth phase is hard enough, but acting on the insight is even more challenging."" username=""""] I remember looking at a report on Apple in 2009, analyzing smartphones’ potential market size, assigning a conservative market share to the iPhone and basically saying that over the next several years Apple’s sales could accelerate (or continue at the then-current rate of 30 percent or so) and reach $100 billion from less than $20 billion that year. I saw the logic in the analysis, but it was difficult for me (and, I think, for most people) to mentally process a high growth rate going exponential. By the way, iPhone annual sales reached $155 billion in 2015.

Investing at the pivot point when growth rates accelerate is especially tough for value investors (present company included). As revenue growth accelerates, costs usually don’t rise as quickly, and therefore earnings increase at an even faster rate than revenue — now earnings growth is truly exponential. This dynamic creates a lot of value, which our linear brains may or may not process.

In 2009, Apple was not statistically cheap — it already had a high valuation. It was hard for a value investor to see a margin of safety. That year the stock was at about $29, or 22 times 2009 earnings. In hindsight it was cheap — in 2010, Apple earned $2.20. Fast-forward another year, and $29 was a steal — in 2011 it earned $4.01 (I am not even counting the cash Apple had on its balance sheet).

This brings me to ARM Holdings, which designs and licenses processors. Unlike a traditional semiconductor company, ARM doesn’t manufacture or even outsource the manufacturing of its processors.

Companies like Apple, Broadcom and Qualcomm have an architectural license — they license ARM’s platform and then build their processors on top of it, turning ARM’s base design into an operating system for processors. ARM’s platform allows Qualcomm processors to work in Samsung phones and be interchangeable with Samsung’s own ARM-based processor. As architectural license holders pour billions of dollars into R&amp;D for their ARM-based processors, they increase the value of ARM’s ecosystem and thus widen ARM’s competitive advantage. Today 97 percent of mobile devices run on ARM-based processors. ARM keeps its royalty rate very low — it makes a few pennies on each processor sold.

Son admired ARM’s business from afar for ten years. He has said that if SoftBank hadn’t been burdened with the Sprint turnaround, he would have tried to buy ARM sooner. Recently, SoftBank raised $10 billion of cash by selling down its stake in Alibaba and about $8 billion by selling its ownership in Supercell to China’s Tencent. These transactions gave SoftBank dry powder to make the ARM acquisition.

Son believes we are at the inflection point when the Internet of Things (IoT) market is about to enter the exponential growth phase. There are 7 billion people in the world today. In 2015, ARM sold 15 billion processors — about 2 processors per person. By 2020, ARM expects to sell 75 billion processors a year — a fivefold increase.

But that is just the start. According to Son, in the long run we are going to need hundreds if not thousands of processors per person. Cars, streetlights, home appliances, hospital patients — everything will be connected to the Internet.

Cows will become part of IoT. They’ll have a sensor on their body telling the farmer when to milk or whether the cow is sick. A sensor with GPS will pinpoint the location of every cow in the field, viewable on an iPad. I don’t know the first thing about cows, and I came up with these ideas in two minutes. Can you imagine the real IoT applications that lie ahead, created by people who actually know about cows and farming? (I was half joking when I wrote this, but “connected cow” is in our future —check this out.)

All of those “Things” will need processors, and ARM is well positioned to be the company designing them and collecting pennies from each one.

ARM is better off being part of SoftBank than being an independent public company. The Internet of Things will require significant investment, which could penalize ARM’s short-term earnings. Son doesn’t care about short-term — remember, he has a 300-year plan for SoftBank. In fact, Son has agreed to double ARM’s workforce in the U.K. over the next five years.

Now let’s get to the price SoftBank paid for ARM. In 2016, ARM should produce revenue of $1.6 billion and earnings of $660 million. Let’s say that by 2020 the number of ARM processors sold increases fivefold but the price of each processor (and thus the royalty) declines by 50 percent. ARM’s revenue would be up by three times, to $4.8 billion. Let’s assume that, as promised, Son doubles ARM’s R&amp;D; that gives us aftertax earnings of $2.8 billion. In other words, SoftBank is paying less than 12 times earnings for this company, which in 2020 will still just be in the early stages of explosive growth. If that scenario plays out, Son probably created at least $10 of value per SoftBank share by making the ARM acquisition.

Son has a tremendous investment track record, but he is not infallible. He bought Sprint in hopes of merging it with T-Mobile, cutting costs and doing with the combined business what he did with Vodafone Japan. Son miscalculated: U.S. regulators have blocked the merger, and T-Mobile’s CEO ended up being a marketing genius and has taken market share from Sprint.

Last year Son became Sprint’s chief network officer. His goal is to improve Sprint’s network while spending a fraction of what competitors are spending. Son has said recently that Sprint will stop bleeding cash and will turn cash flow positive this year. But he is the first one to admit that the purchase of Sprint was a mistake.

What if the purchase of ARM was a mistake? What if ARM continues to grow 15 percent a year over the next four years? Then its earnings will be $1.2 billion, and at 19 times earnings it will be worth $23 billion. Son will have overpaid by $8 billion, which will equal the 43 percent premium he paid over ARM’s last quoted price, destroying about $4 of value per SoftBank share. In our sum-of-the-parts analysis, we get a conservative value north of $40 to $50 a share for SoftBank. Therefore, even in the worst case, SoftBank at a recent price of $25 a share is undervalued.

Exponential growth is born in the eye of a perfect storm. Advances in big data, the proliferation of the cloud, miniaturization of low-powered processors (and a decline in their price), a drastic improvement in wireless Internet that will only get better with 5G, the ubiquity of smartphones and smart devices — each one of these, independently, probably would not matter that much for IoT. But together they become a significant accelerator for the entrance of IoT into the exponential growth phase.

When you buy SoftBank stock, you bet on the jockey. And this jockey’s interests are aligned with those of SoftBank’s shareholders. Masayoshi Son owns 20 percent of SoftBank shares; therefore, each acquisition he makes is paid for not with Monopoly money but with his own. Over the past 35 years, he has made many decisions that at the time were unpopular and unorthodox but that turned out to be tremendous home runs.

This time is no different. Son’s track record has bought him the benefit of the doubt on the ARM purchase. If he made a mistake, he may have destroyed $4 a share of SoftBank’s value, but at the company’s current undemanding valuation, I could even live with that outcome.

P.S. Let me address the elephant in the room — SoftBank’s debt. I keep seeing the media saying that SoftBank has $110 billion of debt. Factually, this number is accurate; in reality it overstates SoftBank’s debt by about 100 percent.

As of last quarter, when the debt figure shifted somewhat after the ARM acquisition, SoftBank did have about $110 billion of debt. However, $33 billion was Sprint’s. SoftBank owns more than 80 percent of Sprint, and so this debt consolidated on SoftBank’s balance sheet. But if Sprint were to go bankrupt, SoftBank would not be responsible for any of that $33 billion. Also, SoftBank has $21 billion in cash. Thus its net debt position is closer to $56 billion. SoftBank’s Japanese telecom business produces about $7 billion of operating income (and $11 billion of EBITDA). Though $56 billion is a lot of billions, in relation to SoftBank’s earning power it is a reasonable amount; and once you account for a variety of other SoftBank assets, that number is even less significant.

I have an account with robinhood ($500) and been messing around occasionally with various winning and losing strategies, messing with charts on tradingview, and am currently paper trading options on stocks with Optionshouse.

The one thing I hate about the stock market is how many stocks there are, and my mind keeps coming up with random strategies and ideas that are made more convoluted when you consider the share volume of stocks and ETF's. Yes I know, keep a small watchlist, etc, and I have done this I'm not a straight scrub/newbie. Paper trading options (only liquid ones) is going pretty well, though I still need a lot more practice. The problem is these options are still on stocks. 

I have also paper traded forex and since there are far less pairs, it makes it easier to focus. 24/7 is nice too. I just want to hear opinions on either side. 

I am under no illusions and am well aware I'm not going to be a millionaire in a year. Regardless of what I trade, the goal is to build a small account. I don't really intend to add or remove any money from the account for at least a year after I start.

Now, I know what you're thinking, ""this is stupid, TWTR has been down since Trump announced his candidacy, ban this fag"". This may be true, but now that he is president/overlord/fuhrer/God, the MSM will have to follow him, not just disagree with him like they have in the past year. Also, TWTR is up almost 1% just today, which is more of a return than most of you get in year.

Now because so many of the delightful citizens on this subreddit can't read, here is a graphical representation of what will happen:

16-11-11,5cev4z,"Naive Questions regarding process behind ""investment managers/advisors"", private equity firms, and the mix.","I recently started a job with a small RE Developer, and entering the whole private equity side of things. I did not study finance in college, and do not come from a wealthy family, so I've never had exposure to investing besides the Robinhood app and my 401k plan. There are two other companies in our building:  ""XX Investment Management"" and ""YY Fund Advisors"".

For my own edification I went on their websites, and it just seems so vague. The Investment Manager seems to do""Large and mid cap"" equity investments and fixed income investments. The Fund Manager invests in MLPs. Similar to Real Estate development, I am assuming both companies pool money together by promising their investors a minimum yield, then purchase interests in private companies.


___________________________________________________

So my questions are as follows:

* It's clear these firms purchase interest in private companies - how do they find these companies? Are there ""brokers"" for this sort of thing, that connect growing companies with these kind of investment managers?

* On the other hand, how do these firms find investors? Is there a database of wealthy individuals that they just cold call?

* These investment managers/Private equity firms seem to be a dime a dozen, are there really that many private companies offering up interest in their companies to satisfy this demand?

* So let's say I win ~~$250,000~~ $2.5 million in the lottery. The funds transfer to my checking account. I do not want to spend it for 10 years. I guess I have a few options: ~~keep the money in my insured checking account but make no interest~~. Purchase a 10-year treasury bond and make minimal interest. Try my luck in the stock market, ETFS, Mutual Funds, etc...

OR invest in companies and/or real estate. Is there an average annual ""Yield"" that these firms promise?

* Going off my last question, how would I choose a private equity firm to work with? I suppose I could just google 'investment managers' in my area and have meetings with them and see what they offer? After that, I put  ~~$100k~~ $1 million in  their fund, sign a contract that allows them to hold for x amount of years, then just wait?

16-11-11,5cgquf,"Beginner trading on Robinhood for a year, what next?","Hi there!

So I'm quite the rookie when it comes to investing and the stock market. I started investing in stocks with Robinhood due to their zero commissions and ease of use. 

I'm pretty proud of myself for not losing every penny I've invested. I'd post a screenshot of my progress so far so I could just show you all, but I'm unsure of how to do that... Anyway, I've achieved a 15.23% return since August 10, 2015, with a smaller sum of under $1k to start out to learn and such. I used the Standard &amp; Poor's Netadvantage Database that I have access to through my University to research the vast majority of my investments. 

Some things I've learned: 
-15.23% doesn't mean jack squat as that could reverse at any moment
-I really have no idea what I'm doing
-A lot of the ""gurus, experts, stock news columns, etc."" don't have much more of an idea for the future of the market, I feel like a lot of what they report and talk about is hindsight and past happenings, and if I were to act on their info I'd be in the negative
-I don't feel comfortable withdrawing any money I've earned by either dividends or gains, I'd rather re-invest 
-I'd like to invest as another means of income, but as stated above, I don't feel comfortable withdrawing any gains
-It's better to just hold onto a losing stock and ride it out if the company is doing decent and doesn't look like it's going to go under


In summary, my question is what should my next step be? I know there's a good amount of resources to learn about the markets here, is there any place else I should look? 

Lastly, how can I actually make an income off of investing? Should I keep pouring money into my Robinhood acount? Or should I start up another account with a different brokerage and pay fees and such? 

Thanks in advance for any advice and criticism, it's greatly appreciated! ",6

# Description

Not know what FB does? Where you been living? ;) Joking aside, here's how they describe themselves:

&gt; Our mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected. Our top priority is to build useful and engaging products that enable people to connect and share through mobile devices and personal computers. We also help people discover and learn about what is going on in the world around them, enable people to share their opinions, ideas, photos and videos, and other activities with audiences ranging from their closest friends to the public at large, and stay connected everywhere by accessing our products, including:

&gt; * **Facebook**. Facebook is a mobile application and website that enables people to connect, share, discover, and communicate with each other on mobile devices and personal computers. We had 1.04 billion daily active users (DAUs) on average in December 2015, an increase of 17% compared to December 2014. We had 934 million DAUs who accessed Facebook from a mobile device on average in December 2015, an increase of 25% compared to December 2014. There are a number of different ways to engage with people on Facebook, the most important of which is News Feed which displays an algorithmically-ranked series of stories and advertisements individualized for each person.
&gt; * **Instagram**. Instagram is a mobile application that enables people to take photos or videos, customize them with filter effects, and share them with friends and followers in a photo feed or send them directly to friends.
&gt; * **Messenger**. Messenger is a messaging application available for mobile and web on a variety of platforms and devices. Messenger enables people to reach others instantly and simply, and also enables businesses to engage with customers seamlessly and securely.
&gt; * **WhatsApp**. WhatsApp Messenger is a fast, simple and reliable mobile messaging application that is used by people around the world and is available on a variety of mobile platforms.
&gt; * **Oculus**. Our Oculus virtual reality technology and content platform power products that allow people to enter a completely immersive and interactive environment to play games, consume content, and connect with others.

&gt; We generate substantially all of our revenue from selling advertising placements to marketers. Our ads let marketers reach people based on a variety of factors including age, gender, location, interests, and behaviors. Marketers purchase ads that can appear in multiple places including on Facebook, Instagram, and third-party applications and websites.

I'm not trying to be funny, but isn't it remarkable the position they give Oculus in their description. I wonder will be look back and smile... as shareholders?

## Recent financials 

It's a powerhouse! Sales expanded by $6bn in 2015 having expanded by $4bn in 2014. 

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $18bn | $12bn | $8bn | $5bn | $4bn|
|EPS | $1.29 | $1.10 | $0.60 | $0.01 | $0.46|

Now, when it comes to tech... I've spotted a trend, I think... that when the delta in sales accelerates, you know you've found a company that will dominate it's space. Go back and look at MSFT, AAPL (time of the iPod), and more recently NFLX.

And if you think the growth for FB is over, think again. The brokers are forecasting $27bn for 2016 (up $9bn) and $37bn for 2017.

## Competition

Their competition section doesn't mention names, other than Google.

&gt; Our business is characterized by innovation, rapid change, and disruptive technologies. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including from companies that provide tools to facilitate communications and the sharing of information, companies that enable marketers to display advertising, and companies that provide development platforms for application developers. We compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain marketers, and to attract and retain developers to build compelling mobile and web applications that integrate with our products.

But the following list is pretty reasonable. I'd add in SnapChat if it was public. Though I doubt that ever happens. Zuck'll pay up first, I reckon.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Facebook Inc | $24,670M | 52% | 16%
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd | $16,628M | 36% | 24%
Amazon.com, Inc. | $127,993M | 9% | 14%
Alphabet Inc | $85,537M | 33% | 15%
Apple Inc. | $215,639M | 33% | 37%
Microsoft Corporation | $85,394M | 32% | 22%
Netflix, Inc. | $8,176M | 59% | 7%
Twitter Inc | $2,523M | 3% | -9%
Verizon Communications Inc. | $127,894M | 35% | 83%

They've got an beautiful margins, reasonable returns, with only Netflix looking peachier.

## Cash / Debt?

Today Zuckerberg has $26,140M of net cash at his disposal. That is the equivalent of 8% of the market value of Facebook Inc. So a little $35bn bid for Snapchat would be easy. Though I expect Evan will want to keep some shares if they can strike a deal.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $156.63 for Facebook Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 30% to their target.

# Valuation

So today's 30x would be 40x if the stock hit the price target? Now, I'd probably be worried, if it wasn't clear that they are going to be one of the few dominant tech franchises of our lifetime. And with their current sales of $25bn v Google's $85bn you can see plenty of room for growth. Okay, it's not as valuable a franchise as Google, yet! 

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/fb.o/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
FB.O | $348,166M | 30x | 35% | 0% | 3%
BABA.K | $233,390M | 29x | 27% | 0% | 4%
AMZN.O | $352,754M | 156x | 35% | 0% | 3%
GOOGL.O | $531,688M | 23x | 19% | 0% | 5%
AAPL.O | $574,770M | 12x | 9% | 2% | 12%
MSFT.O | $456,413M | 20x | 10% | 3% | 8%
NFLX.O | $49,532M | 288x | 65% | 0% | 9%
TWTR.K | $13,133M | 35x | 28% | 0% | 0%
VZ | $190,338M | 12x | 2% | 5% | 21%

Though *beware* when Wall Street says it's trading on 30x they are talking Adjusted EPS, not reported. in the 3rd quarter they reported EPS of 0.82 but Wall Street magically excluded employee stock-based compensation to come up with a $1.09 figure. So, the dilution doesn't count ????? Let's just *inflate* the figures by 30%, why don't we.

# Dividends

Facebook Inc is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. And why would it? Plenty of growth left in the young dog.

# Governance

There are A and B shares :(

&gt; As of December 31, 2015, there were 2,293 million shares and 552 million shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, respectively, issued and outstanding.

Zuckerberg controls the business as he owns the majority of the B-Shares which have 10 votes, v 1 vote per A Share

I hate this sort of thing. The insane, I know better of many founders. Though I suppose in his case, and the Google boys, they deserve the benefit of the doubt.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -3% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 4%. On a 1 month view the stocks off 7% with earnings forecasts up 3%. Doesn't matter how you present it, some hot air escaped after the 3Q results, even though they beat forecasts.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers they pointed out

&gt; We're pleased to see nearly 1.8 billion people now use Facebook every month and nearly 1.2 billion people use it every day.

Though they clearly spooked investors long-term with talk about slowing growth long term and 2017 being an investment year.

So, I'm convinced they are a dominant franchise...d'oh you say. And as much as I love to hate them... it's hard to argue against owning one at 30x if there really is a lot more growth to come. 

I don't see any signs of saturation. Do you?

And if you are worried about Snap, don't. I bet Zuckerberg knows he has to buy it. How else will he maintain his 100% dominance in social/photo-sharing. He'll pay the *danger* money and keep his monopoly. We'll thank him, I bet.

16-11-11,5cezj4,Calculating the tax bill for owning a commodity ETF like USO,"I have looked all over and cannot find this information. There are lots of ""warnings"" and elementary discussions of this online (see, e.g., the piece I've linked), but no concrete discussions of what the tax implications are. Yes, I understand that there will be tax even if I do not sell any of the ETF in a given year. Yes, I understand that a certain portion of my tax will be paid at the LTCG rate and a certain portion will not. I get that the reason for all of this is that the fund is constantly buying and selling commodities futures, so gains and/or losses are constantly being realized beyond any superficial gain/loss that I realize in buying/selling the ETF at different prices.

What I recall reading in addition to all of the above is that I may have a hefty tax bill even if the ETF's price is static. Is this true? If so, how can I calculate the amount of gain that is realized and ultimately what tax I will owe? I have not seen any concrete description of what an investor can expect the tax bill to be. 

For example, hypothesize that on Nov 15, 2016, I buy $10,000 worth of USO or UWTI, and that 1 month later—on December 15, 2016—I sell it at the current market price, which is still $10,000.

Is there any way to know how much tax I will owe in this situation? If so, how do I know and what will it be? If it's not possible to KNOW, can I estimate? If so, how?

http://m.nasdaq.com/article/a-basic-tax-guide-for-holders-of-commodity-etfs-etns-and-trusts-cm17739

This may be a truly elementary question, but I am seriously interested to learn and have done some research but have found nothing, so I will appreciate any guidance.

NB: I am NOT asking for unrelated warnings about contango, backwardation, and other complexities involved in owning futures, EXCEPT to the extent they are necessarily tied to tax implications.

If you believe that rural economies will get a boost, then:

1. Casey's General Store (CASY)

2. Tractor Supply (TSCO).

Money will go to both if he is successful in boosting rural economies. Casey's is the only game in town in many very small rural communities, not to mention I think the 5th or 6th largest pizza chain in the US (although it's known more for being a convenience store.)

16-11-11,5ch1pu,Long term investments for a young person? New to stocks.,"Hello, I'm 22 and have put some money into investments. I have stock in marijuana companies, solar companies, water companies, and some others. 

My main two investments with a long term goal in mind are GE and BAM. However, I don't really know how or when to sell. For instance, GE is said to be cyclical, so are you supposed to sell the stock when it is high, then buy again when it is low? Or should I just hold on to it for a few years and sell then? And should I just hold the marijuana stocks for a few years?

Thank you for any advice, and sorry if my questions are banal.",1

Delta was at .48 and theta was at -.03. Gamma held around .50. I don't remember what IV was but I think it was low and held steady during the day. Well the underlying went up  by 0.32 since I bought and BAC finished the day off at 19.02. Given the Greeks I cited, I'd expect the value of the call to go up by about 0.12 or so. It only went up by 0.04.

Don't let it happen to you.","TD Direct Investing sometimes randomly have a person from their ""Risk Department"" to manually ""review"" the low-cap/nano-cap stocks that you want to purchase before they approve your order of getting filled. Their review process can take anywhere between 1-3 minutes then your order gets filled at a random time after they hit their ""approve"" button. From that time wasted, the price of your stock would have changed significantly. I lost $100 this morning because when I tried to sell one of my stocks, their review process wasted a lot of time. Consequently, my stock price have dropped and the order got filled a few minutes after. 

I haven't had this happen to me until the last couple of days of trading with them. I spoke to a person from the TD Risk Department and this is supposedly a common step that they must go through for low-cap stocks (he spoke very rudely as well). They actually have a huge watchlist of stocks that they don't allow their clients to buy (I wasn't allowed to get info on what kind stocks they were and what kind of information they usually look at but was only told about it).

The stocks that I was playing were SAEX, HMNY, BSPN which are between $1-10, They are from NASDAQ so wasn't even pink slip or OTC.

This was $RTN (Raytheon).

Adding to my deep technical analysis I also thought that Clinton (although priced in) would still be a good thing for defence contractors since she likes selling weapons to the sand people with the money. Trump, on the other hand would be even more beneficial as he wants to increase military spending. 

All in all, it played out pretty nicely. After losing 5,5k on oil in the last two years because I held UWTI for a longer period of time(did I already say that I'm a faggot?) this balances out quite good.

I have been following ticker CGC (Canopy Growth Corp) which is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange for a little while now. I also have seen that this company is traded OTC as ticker TWMJF. I'm somewhat confused how these two tickers are similar and different than each other. 

I fully understand CGC and how buying normal shares of CGC would work if I lived in Canada and traded with a broker who exhanged TSX stocks. However, as an American I'm confused where my money is going if I buy a share of TWMJF. Is it like a pass through entity somehow? Are CGC and TWMJF the same company? If TWMJF goes bankrupt does that also mean CGC is bankrupt? If CGC owns physical assets is it considered that TWMJF also owns those assets? It also sounds to me like OTC trades are slightly more risky since finding someone to buy your shares when it comes time to sell may be more difficult for a OTC stock than a NYSE stock for example. I am just curious as to how all of this works. 

Basically, I would prefer to buy CGC directly if I could, but if I buy TWMJF am I buying shares of a company that owns physical assets and trades as CGC on the Toronto Stock Exchange or not?

16-11-11,5chn1v,"A counterargument to the Efficient Market Hypothesis (and thus, index funds)","When I first started, I read A Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton Malkiel. He wrote very well - I began to think that it's a 'no brainer' to buy index funds and that beating the index would just be ""luck""

-&gt; **I now think otherwise.**


In his book (which is a fascinating read), Malkiel walks through many systematic investing philosophies, discusses their unique traits, then ""disproves"" them.


He is very well known for his argument against technical analysis. He says (paraphrased) that technical analysis is not dependable because past historical results can not predict future results. He then gives the example about flipping a coin heads ten times does not change its probability of being heads the 11th time.  

But one can actually say the very same thing about index funds. He claims that index funds have beat active investors up till now and thus will continue to beat active investors in the future. Sound familiar?  

First of all, his statistics are boosted by the fact that up till *now*, index funds have beat active investors by a wide margin. There's no telling that this will be the same in the future. If at this moment in time index funds have not beaten active investing by such a wide margin, would you have believed his claim? I think at the very least, his claim will have a lot less ground.  

But more importantly, past results do not predict future results (using his same argument against technical analysis).  

Just because the s&amp;p500 has returned 7% annually up till now does not imply that it will return 7% in the future. Nor does it imply that it will beat active investors in the future.  

While index funds will be best for investors who do not have the time/effort to invest, it is not a true statement that everyone should just invest in index funds because alpha is unattainable.  


**My take from a fundamental perspective**
We need to think about WHY index funds have been doing so well. Due to the popularity of Vanguard/Random walk down wall street/index funds, the general citizen has been blindly investing their incomes into the US stock market. While the average person probably has set up their 401k, they probably do not understand *how* investments are being made. (how often have you heard people say ""just leave your money in the s&amp;p500, you'll make 7% annually"")

It doesn't hurt that since the 2008 crash, stocks in general have been helped by p/e expansion as well as rising earnings.

At some point, there will no longer be increases in the number of people investing in index funds. At this point, the market will stagnate (equal supply and demand).

**extreme case** If and when the s&amp;p500 reaches a p/e of 50, this is implying a 2% return on investment. Why? Forget stocks, and think about a general business. If you bought it at a p/e of 50, what's your return on investment? Assuming no earnings growth, it is 1/50 = roughly 2%
- but I digress as this would start to be a discussion of fundamental analysis.

Earnings can not grow forever for the USA economy - or at least certainly can not grow forever at the great pace it has in recent years. A generously priced market coupled with low growth implies low growth in intrinsic value. Any gains the stock market has would thus not be in intrinsic value but rather only due to investors pouring more money into it because they have no other investment alternatives.

**conclusion**
I don't have a problem with index funds becoming more and more popular - it means more buying and selling opportunities for me. But index funds can never replace intelligent investing.

(note: i know he doesn't reference the s&amp;p500 but instead the total market, but the same idea holds).

Obviously, it's pointless to ask people here for future predictions, so I'm asking for past experiences. What other stocks saw huge spikes in weeks, but don't have the fundamentals to back it up? I'm guessing the tech bubble is a good place to start..?",9

Commercial applications are huge and are expected to deliver efficiency gains in logistics, manufacturing, medicine, services and elsewhere.
Vuzix is a microcap but yet it is still one of the leading smart glass developer/manufacturers and has just launched its next generation M300 product that has been well received and won the Compass Intelligence's Enterprise Wearable Device of the Year award alongside competitors such as Samsung and Microsoft.
The company says it has hundreds of pending orders from Value Added Resellers and expects, following research, demand for commercial smart glasses to total $30 billion over the next 9 years.
Vuzix is a microcap with all the extra risk that that entails but with a market cap of $132 million, if they can execute delivery of this product then the upside could be huge.

16-11-12,5cibyx,Becoming an investment analyst without BBA but instead Economics major?,"Hello, 
I am currently a nineteen years old college freshmen, who is currently planning to major in Economics at University of Michigan-AA.
I know that Umich's Ross business school is pretty recognized in business world. But I also know that I won't be able to get in to Ross due to myself just not being academically prepared.
For some time in the past, I aimed to get into Ross and major in their Finance major to become a financial analyst. However, I read on some websites that Econ is actually more popular amongst current investment analysts out there. And this really kind of relieved me at the time.
Graduating from Ross business school would give me a BBA, compared to Econ major (in Literature, Science, Arts school), which I assume don't give BBA since it's not under a business school.
So I am wondering if I go with my current plan of majoring in Economics without BBA from University of Michigan, am I still on a fair track to become an investment analyst after graduating?

I believe when buying stocks, of course its great to see the dollar per share go up, but in the big picture what will matter more is your gain in percentage....

But with options, growth in percentage means less right? For example: If i purchased Amazon at 739/share and it went up to 750 in two weeks...That's just a movement of  1.49%, Thus any money I have in it will only move up by that small margin.

BUT..

If I bought a Call for Amazon at $735/share (for a premium of 350)  NOW the contract goes up to 750.
 (750x100) - (735x100) shares 
=Gross Profit of 1,500


1,500-  350


=1,150 Net Profit

Please correct me if i'm wrong in any of this, it just seems to good to be true. At this point...if this is true...why would anyone invest money in Amazon as opposed to buying calls?",20

3/4 of analysts rate NVDA as either a buy or as an ""underperformer"". Meaning, they see more upside.

However, I noticed something else.

AMD follows NVDA's trend. It's not strong, but it's subtle.

When NVDA earnings spiked over 20%, AMD's stock rised 5%. It's thought the rise is due to SP500 bullish movement, but I disagree. I think it's NVDA.

Now, when will the correlation end? When AMD publishes bad news. 

For now, betting CAlls for AMD or NVDA seems safe. I think NVDA will keep rising. AMD doesn't seem like a big oponent.

too long, dick read; buy nvda or amd calls. AMD will hit $7 in less than 2 weeks. NVDA is posed to hit 100 by end of this year.

16-11-12,5clkf5,Life changing business idea,"
IMPORTANT... PLEASE READ...

so i went to sleep last night and i had a dream. in the dream, i was having a meeting with some faggots and bag holders about a business idea. then i woke up energized and excited because i know this idea could change the world. the name of the organization will be protectors of the YOLO group. im going to manifest this dream into a reality.

here is the simplified business plan i wrote (more complex and in depth business plan is still a work in progress)

BUSINESS DESCRIPTION

Have faggots receiving pension or disability and wealthy bag holders pay faggots and Special faggots to train them with the necessary skills to get yachs in a bearish environment to fight SEC or fight in a jungle warfare environment to fight the Martin Shkreli's group in the market. We could also go to africa and fight starving african kids.

TARGET DEMOGRAPHICS

1.) We all know that SEC believe that when they are shorted by a faggot that they will not go to heaven and get their 72 gainz. With that being said, we will target and recruit the brave faggots of the free world so they can deploy in the market and deny these bastards the pleasure of fucking their 72 gainz.

2.) Faggots getting social security, disability, and or pension. With that free money they cannot worry about paying their bills or supporting their family while they go to get yachs. I myself if getting disability worth $2900 a month for being schizophrenic, bipolar, manic, and for having PTSD. I also have a marijuana business that generates a substantial amount of income annually which we could use that money towards the cause.

3.) Rich millennials who have a trust fund or rich bag holders types such as stock brokers business owners and more.

HOW TO GET YACHS, GOLD, AND PUSSY

we could receive donations of yachs, gold, and pussy from companies or individual entities or governments.
we will have pump and dumps in the boiler room or insider information of the market and we will edit the footage and verbally abuse or abuse their logos in the video which will be in youtube and in the official website. by doing this, it could be an incentive to short and support the cause.

we could also use the weaponized faggotry and yolos of the faggots organic to fighting for the cause.

MARKETING PLAN

We could have a payment plan where they could pay off the training costs every month interest free.

i myself am a faggot veteran of 2008 (invested in DIS, NVDA, NBG) i am in need of a business partner with a business degree or i could also use investors.

i went to school for business for 1 and a half years but i didnt complete it because i changed my major to art so with little experience that i got i could run this business for you.

not sure who blessed me with this idea in my dream but i think its a higher universal intelligence or god or something but i dont know. i want to make it happen.

THANKS FOR READING!!!

16-11-13,5cowab,Resources for an overview of the elements of trading successfully.,"I've been trading for around a year and after some big wins followed by some big losses I've decided to completely rewrite my books on how to trade.  I'm looking for a resource that gives an overview of the elements of successful long term trading. These are some key aspects I have so far:


Mental State: 

- One must be emotionally and psychologically ready
- To prepare each day have a mantra that is read before the trading session begins

Risk: 

- Position size - Kelly betting 
- Expectancy - This ultimately determines whether your strategy is feasible
Ie your R/R could be 10/1 but if your strategy only wins 1/20 times the expectancy will be negative.  
- Exits / Entries and R/R - given the average returns of the market, is your reward feasible ie will it occur enough for it to be worth the losers/risk (linking back in with the expectancy)    

Strategy:

- Backtest and paper trade all strategies
- What market conditions are present when the strategy is successful / unsuccessful - (One way of knowing when to use each strategies)* 
- When the strategy fails it should be known why
  

Portfolio performance: 

- Aiming for a smooth equity curve with a small drawdown 
- *Another way to determine when to use a strategy is measure the equity curve against a moving average, when the equity crosses the MA pull the strategy from trading real money  


Using this infomation I want to build a trading plan that not only outlines strategies but portfolio management / risk (position sizing) methodologies/ mental state and all other relevant factors that determine successful trading in the long term. What resources are available with this kind of broad scope/macro view of trading ? ",5

16-11-13,5crk4c,What to expect from the Mexican Peso now that Trump go elected?,"I'm basically writing this post because of a report that I watched on Bloomberg a couple days ago. With Trump's shaking election on the financial market, some analysts predict that the Mexican peso might be an undervalued investment opportunity as it may hike back to its value before Trump's victory was announced. The retrieval or elimination from the NAFTA deal, even if it gets consummated, seems like it will take some time to happen, as much as the border wall (if it will ever happen, if you ask me). Basically any decision that might directly harm the Mexican economy seems to be a bit far from taking place and the Peso's significant drop might have just been a jump-scare reaction by the market that may subside in not long (like the Yen's and the GBP's sudden rise), as I understood the report. 

As a rookie in investments who's only dealt with currencies in the last couple years it left me wondering a bit.

Whilst this is, of course, sheer speculation and nothing about Trump's policy is sure until Trump actually presides or, at least, picks his team, what are you guys' opinions? Should I just forget about buying Mexican Pesos as it's pretty much dice rolling or is there an actual lucrative opportunity?

I live in California, rather close to the Silicon Valley, where numerous major tech companies have risen (and subsequently fallen on their own), but I noticed that a large amount of them can be easily found to have stocks．

Would it be a strange bet to try and invest in say, 100 of the companies and try to watch their stocks climb? I know that one company's stock can only go up so much, but what if 100 companies (with generally positive overall growth) grew that amount? To put this into perspective, rather than waiting for the fruit of one tree from one big company to ripen, why not harvest an entire field of crops at once？

Recently we've seen $NVDA explode, and make a ton of money for numerous investors. I'm thinking about an entire tech sector as a whole. For instance big banks all grown exponentially in the past few days. The growth of one company pales in comparison to a bunch of companies. How  about investing in a group of tech companies, and watching that crop of stocks grow over time? Would that actually be a wiser investment?",1

I'm looking to change this allocation after researching a bit on Bogleheads and reading ""A Random Walk Down Wallstreet.""  I'm in my early 30's with a wife and a kid (these are just my finances, not inclusive of my wife's as we manage those separately).

 I've always been a fan of dollar-cost averaging and contribute a few hundred to non-retirement investments and $1k+ to retirement investments every month (plus I have an employer match that I maximize). We have 6+ months of living expenses saved up in cash outside of this, but live in an expensive area.

I'm not super worried about our cash position right now as combined we make good money and my career growth prospects are solid.  However I am potentially looking to shift $10k or so into these investments or start a college fund.  I'm currently thinking something like the below for my target investment allocation:

Questions
=======

1. Does this target allocation seem reasonable in terms of being somewhat aggressive, minimizing fees, etc.?
2. If I were to reallocate to my new target, do I get hit with taxes if I'm immediately reinvesting (going from one mix to the other)?
3. Is the best way to reallocate to just pull the trigger at once while sprinkling in the new $10k across these? This obviously is the opposite of dollar-cost averaging so I'm not sure how to approach that.
4. Are college funds worth investing in? Or can it make more sense to just invest it somewhere else in some situations? Outside of retirement funds, I'm not a huge fan of locking up large sums of money for something that may or may not happen. While I hope my child will get a college education one day, who knows what the future will hold.",14

16-11-13,5csj6s,Discussion of The Financial CHOICE Act and the future of the banking sector,"The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times are reporting that Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling is being vetted by The Trump Transition Team for Secretary of Treasury appointment. Rep. Jeb Hensarling has drafted a reform bill dubbed The Financial CHOICE Act which could be the successor to Dodd-Frank. 


LINK to [executive summary](http://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/financial_choice_act-_executive_summary.pdf)

LINK to [comprehensive outline](http://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/financial_choice_act_comprehensive_outline.pdf)

Some of the changes that stick out to me include:

* Regarding the CFPB: Replace the current single director with a bipartisan, five-member commission which is subject to congressional oversight and appropriations.
* Repeal authority to ban bank products or services it deems “abusive” and its authority to prohibit arbitration. 
* Demand greater accountability and transparency from the Federal Reserve, both in its conduct of monetary policy and its prudential regulatory activity, by including the Housepassed FORM Act.
* Abolish the Office of Financial Research (OFR).
* Allow the SEC to triple the monetary fines sought in both administrative and civil actions in certain cases where the penalties are tied to the defendant’s illegal profits. Give the SEC new authority to impose sanctions equal to investor losses in cases involving “fraud, deceit, manipulation, or deliberate or reckless disregard of a regulatory requirement” where the loss or risk of loss is significant, and increase the stakes for repeat offenders.
* Increase the maximum criminal fines for individuals and firms that engage in insider trading and other corrupt practices. 
* Repeal sections and titles of Dodd-Frank, including the Volcker Rule, that limit capital formation.
* Repeal the SEC’s authority to both prospectively and, possibly, retroactively eliminate or restrict securities arbitration.
* Repeal non-material specialized disclosures.
* Incorporate more than two dozen Committee or House-passed capital formation bills, including:

o H.R. 1090 – “Retail Investor Protection Act”

o H.R. 4168 – “Small Business Capital Formation Enhancement Act”

o H.R. 4498 – “Helping Angels Lead Our Startups Act”

o H.R. 5019 – “Fair Access to Investment Research Act”

* Incorporate more than two dozen regulatory relief bills for community financial
institutions, including:

o H.R. 1941 – “Financial Institutions Examination Fairness and Reform Act”

o H.R. 2896 – “Taking Account of Institutions with Low Operational Risk Act”

o H.R. 1210 – “Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act”

o H.R. 766 – “Financial Institution Customer Protection Act” 

With the aforementioned speculations assumed to be true, how do you see the CHOICE Act affecting the banking sector? Do you feel it to be friendlier to banks and the possibility for growth? Do you feel it's riskier for the average citizen?",1
16-11-13,5cq2ak,"Why I'm long silver and buying the DOW on dips.","Silver/Gold took a major hit last week with expectations of massive inflation and interest rate increases (roughly 20%). Much of the capital pulled out of silver/gold was then invested in stocks which currently have extremely positive outlooks. With that said, the market will likely cool this week which may present an opportunity to buy DOW/Nasdaq/S&amp;P. Since Trump has little opportunity to say something dumb in that time, Silver/Gold will possibly continue to drop. That said, in the long run trump will sink the economy for a period of time within the next 3 years and silver's actual usability as a product for technology means it is more desirable then gold.

The thing is, their company includes Seamless and other websites acquired which are in the same business of delivering food. [GrubHub Brands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grubhub)

All of which are located in major urban cities that support the Democratic party. This announcement could instead bolster their business.

Their reviews were hit by a wave of 1 stars and angry comments - but people only do that when they are outraged. People are a lot less likely to leave reviews when nothing goes wrong, and have satisfactory service.

GrubHub also has some very bullish news:

The country's student debt is now over 1.4 trillion and getting bigger. Yeah I know it's not going to be as bad as the mortgage crisis, but hedge funds are starting to consider shorting it.

Would be super cool if there was an inverse ETF for this. I can totally see not paying loans as becoming the new ""hip"" thing to do.

16-11-13,5cr8nw,Monsanto Deal Arbitrage,"The Monsanto buyout for $128 cash per share is pending regulator approval. Bayer has stated they expect it to be completed by the end of 2017. Oct '17 calls are about half the price of Jan '18 calls, and IMO it should be known by then whether the deal will go through. Current pricing is about $2 for $115 strikes and about $1 for $120 strikes. Since the future price is $128 (or close to it) if the deal is approved, current prices suggest odds of 5.5 to 1 or 7 to 1, depending on which strike you pick. Those prices may not be accurate, as they're pretty illiquid so it's just a guess based on bid, ask, and last. 

In short, I don't believe those are priced appropriately. Note that Bayer will pay Monsanto $2bil if the deal is blocked ($4.67 per share). Given that level of confidence by Bayer, I don't believe the odds are as low as the calls imply. I don't think there is an appropriate hedge position though, as a blocked deal won't necessarily drop Monsanto's price, especially considering the $2 billion compensation penalty. ",11

[Ewan Spence of Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2016/11/12/apple-macbook-pro-strategy-ipad/) quotes Apple CEO Tim Cook: ""Why would you buy a PC any more?""

Here is the full quote courtesy of [Caitlin McGarry, MacWorld](http://www.macworld.com/article/3003919/ipad/tim-cook-on-ipad-pro-why-would-you-buy-a-pc-anymore.html):

&gt; “I think if you’re looking at a PC, why would you buy a PC anymore? No really, why would you buy one?” Cook told the British publication. “Yes, the iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many, many people. They will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else, other than their phones.”

[Oh shit!](https://media.giphy.com/media/a79Jr229u3bzO/giphy.gif) ...It is true.

Cook says it clearly, and the iPad Pro is their now go-to-line for any productive work regarding you, businesses, and everyone in between.

How could Apple abandon their computer line?

[It's happened before.](http://apple2history.org/history/ah11/)

Steve Wozniak revolutionized the computing industry by his dream, and Steve Jobs pursued his passion with vigor through strife, yet Apple today doesn't fit within any of these qualities as before it once had.

[Apple dismisses the personal computer as too small and unimportant to their business.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSiQA6KKyJo&amp;t=116s)

I am with a new employer who also provided a 403b, and a pension plan. I am currently required to contribute to the pension plan, but have yet to contribute to my 403b for the new employer. My questions are:

1. Should I change my old 403b account into an IRA(more funds to pick from) or roll it over into my new 403b? My new 403B has the following [funds](http://imgur.com/a/YnbXK) to pick from. I currently have the the [UC Pathway 2045](http://imgur.com/a/pNAlr) which is a target fund. However, I hear that Vanguard has better offerings? I am able to do brokerage link on that account which would allow me to invest in a wider variety of things.

2. My employer doesn't match the 403b since they provide a pension plan. If I open the IRA with my old 403 B should I be investing the 5500 max and then investing in my current 403 b?

Quantico and Designated Survivor both started with a cataclysmic event to start the series. Quantico started it's second season with it. 

Both are great examples of Imax tv movies that would have brought an audience to the series. Think about the pilot of Lost and seeing that in IMAX. Also an ABC series. 

But now there is a deal with Marvel to kick start a series through IMAX. Inhumans was supposed to be a movie, now it is a television series launched through Imax. Marvel Agenst of S.H.I.E.L.D is already on foreign Netflix. 

Netflix also has a deal with Disney for Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel movies. 

Launching a series in Imax is the biggest risk any broadcaster has takken since a long time. But if disney owns netflix and Imax, it isn't a risk at all. 

Netflix having Lucas, Disney and Marval and orignal ABC serie makes them the best competitive streaming option world wide. 

HBO is stopping in the Netherlands and giving rights to Liberty Media, Amazon is ramping up to release prime here, because they have the old top gear.

In my opion Disney is ramping up to buy both IMAX and Netflix. ",7

Trump presidency basically mitigates the potential legislation against pricing practices, which has the entire sector up many percentage points. That uncertainty sent this particular symbol tumbling from $14+ to $9 over Berntard's tweet of a Feuerstein hit piece on their 27% price increase of iclusig (ponatinib).

Therefore it seems to me like this has room to run on its way to the April '17 approval date for brigatinib.

16-11-14,5cx4jg,"Aphria, good alternative to CGC","Hi all,

Long time lurker here - after watching all the fuss about marijuana stocks I decided to create an account. Just created an account to post this. I’ve been following marijuana stocks lately, and they’ve made some impressive gains – a lot of focus has been on CGC, though I believe that Aphria is currently almost as good bet that has been slightly ignored as it is not yet trading on the main market, but on the Venture exchange – though I see that changing in the future. Here are my arguments why Aphria is pretty well positioned to be one of the clear winners in the market:

1. Aphria has a business model that has been proven to work – they have increased their growth a lot, and are already profitable, unlike CGC. Their balance sheet looks good, don’t have much debt and are overall in pretty great shape financially. 
2. Their management team has proven to be very successful and smart, as they have focused on growing in medical marijuana industry while slowly preparing for expansion if pot gets legalised. They are currently licensed to use 100 000 sqm of their 900 000 sqm plot – so there’s a lot of room to grow. 

3. That brings me to my second point, they have already achieved very good economies of scale and have 75% gross margin, unlike their peers who sell at much lower margins. As they have excellent technology and knowledge behind greenhouses they are able to grow marijuana at much lower price than their peers as well – their current cost is around 2.5 cad/g, while other companies are growing at around 3 to whopping 15 cad/g, so they are very well positioned to expand. 

4. They focus mostly on oils, which have been a market that is growing even among mass market consumers, though as they grow it themselves, they are easily positioned to shift focus to also selling buds. 
5. They haven’t focused as much on branding as Canopy Growth (Tweed) has, but they have quietly built their business into a profitable one and showed that when it comes to cost leadership they will most likely win the battle. 

6. When legalisation gets announced I can see them easily shifting focus to the consumer market, which they are very well positioned to tackle with their cost leadership. 
7. They have Arlene Dickinson in their board who owns a marketing firm and has considerable experience on the field, which again suggests that they are also starting to focus on the recreational marijuana market. 
So, what do you think? For full disclosure I own Aphria, and re-visited the company today, and decided to buy some more. The current market cap is considerably smaller than CGC but I do not see a reason why it should be given that American market is opening up and Canada is set to announce legalisation soon. I think it’s still trading at a discount given the opportunity we have here. ",33

I won't dip in today as I see tech stocks moving down some more as people start consolidating their gains and the dust settles a bit more, but sometime later this month would be good. 

Tech's down mostly because of a major sector rotation. It's not because the fundamentals on any of the FANG stocks have changed. 

If you do buy, be prepared to hang on for a year or more, so if you want to buy options instead of the stocks directly, go for some LEAPs. It will take a long time for Trump and the Republicans to institute the financial deregulation that they want to put in place, so any economic downturn due to Trump's presidency could take some time to materialize. By then you would have it out like a bandit.

The steepening of the yield curve means that mortgage REITs will have more profit due to the arbitrage strategy they employ. 

This is the chart to keep an eye on: 

https://ycharts.com/indicators/302_year_swap_spread

Its the difference between the two year treasury yield and the thirty year treasury yield. 

For those who are unaware, in the third quarter of 2016 - ORC was able to make 85cents a share profit with the yield spread as low as .66% which is really phenomenal and speaks to how well managed their portfolio is.

The next few quarterly reports I think will show us how ORC will perform with the steepening of the yield curve. 

Disclosure: I've been invested in ORC since  2014 - I am a buy and hold investor.

What this post is not about: Short-term trading, GDX NUGT

In America’s past, the Continental Congress and states had printed fiat currencies. From the start, they depreciated in value until Congress stopped accepting its own paper money in 1781.

Post World War II, America promised that the currency it printed would be backed by gold in reserves. Other countries operated with the dollar, trusting its value. When Nixon took the dollar off the gold standard, the dollar became a scam.

Two generations of Americans have now lived under the fiat currency after Nixon announced currency could no longer be redeemable to gold in 1971. Americans were born into a debt the government had lent out with interest. Finance, healthcare, and education are all propped up by currency being printed by the Federal Reserve, none of which is backed by gold.

The Federal Reserve has always been a scam, too, having been created at the same time as federal income tax. Their policies have always overstretched the power of the government. America’s founding fathers and the Constitution both distrusted anything but the use of gold and silver (read: real fungible money) to pay debt.

On top of that, other countries like China and Russia are building their gold reserves faster than ever to counter the weight of the dollar. China is posed to keep more of its produced gold or purchasing gold from international holders.

The Federal Reserve should have raised rates several times by now, but haven’t, and I don’t believe will. Rather, we will continue printing money for quantitative easing.

Is the world silently turning against our nonsense and tired of trading the dollar? I plan on slowly entering GLD/UGLD/OUNZ after this sell off that's going to find a bottom soon.

Here are some charts I'm too burnt out to explain.

[Gold *weighted* against USD](https://i.imgur.com/mwU5aei.png)

TLDR: USD fiat currency blows. Gold has intrinsic value. I don’t think the Fed can appropriately raise rates in December 2016.

16-11-15,5d0ex8,"Gilead, Buy HIV, Get Hepatitis C for Free","A few months ago I wrote a long article about Gilead that he wanted to title “Gilead: Buy Hepatitis C, Get AIDS for free”.  Today I want to flip that title backwards and call it “Gilead, Buy HIV, Get Hepatitis C for Free.”

We spent a lot of time this quarter talking to our colleagues in the investment industry, soliciting “the other side” argument for Gilead, trying to understand what we are missing about this stock. As we suspected most people cannot overcome the confluence of two business models inside one company: Gilead’s growing, annuity-like HIV business and the shrinking and ultimately finite Hep C business.

Let’s look at the HIV business first.  It is a stable business that is growing about 6-8% a year in the developed markets: unfortunately, 4% more people get infected with HIV every year, and prices go up 2-4% a year.  This business has substantial operational leverage (costs don’t grow as fast as revenues), thus 6-8% revenue growth should bring 8-10% earnings growth.  Twenty years ago, AIDS was a death sentence; today it is an inconvenience.  A person infected with AIDS today has a similar lifespan as a healthy person, but unfortunately for them (fortunately for GILD’s investors) they have to keep taking GILD’s medicine for the rest of their lives.

Gilead has several HIV drugs, which fall into one of two groups: TDF (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate)-based and TAF (tenofovir alafenamide)-based.  Patents for TDF-based drugs expire over the next couple years; however, GILD recently came out with TAF drugs.  They are as effective as TDF drugs but have a fraction of the toxicity – there are fewer signs of kidney injury and decreases in bone density.  The market is slightly skittish about GILD’s ability to transition patients from TDF drugs to TAF drugs – we are not concerned. 

Last year, we observed how a pharmaceutical company was able to successfully extend the life of its patents by shifting patients from a once a day regimen to a three times a week regimen of the same (chemically identical, just higher-dosage) compound.  If pharmaceutical companies were able to pull off this farce and get insurance companies to pay for it, we have not doubt that Gilead will be able to convince governments and insurance companies to pay for new, much superior medicine.  Patents for the company’s TAF-based drugs expire in 2030.

We took Gilead’s HIV revenues, subtracted all HIV-related costs of goods sold and all of the company’s R&amp;D and sales expenses, and arrived at 2017 HIV earnings of close to $4.50.  A high-quality business with very high recurrence of revenue that is growing 8-10% should trade at 15-17 times earnings or $67-76 a share – basically Gilead’s current stock price.

Valuing Gilead’s hepatitis C business is a bit trickier.  With every patient cured the market declines by one patient.  Thankfully for society’s sake, hepatitis C is not a growing market (at least in developed countries).  Our estimate of the value of the hepatitis C business is somewhere between $70 to $120 per share, depending on pricing and number of patients cured.

Also, even though we expensed GILD’s R&amp;D when we arrived at the company’s HIV earnings, we have not given GILD any benefit for future drugs that $3 billion spent annually will deliver in the future.

The market has a hard time digesting a stock whose overall earnings may decline from $13 a share in 2015 to $11, maybe even $10, over the next year or two.  In many respects Gilead reminds us of Apple.  Just like Apple, whose products can fit on one table, the bulk of Gilead’s revenue comes from a handful of products.

Just like Apple, whose stock was punished when iPhone sales declined in 2016 because they were up 50% in the previous year (and thus stole sales from 2016 and 2017), Gilead’s initial sales of Hep C drugs benefited from incredible pent-up demand from sick people who waited years for this miracle drug.  Gilead over earned in 2015, and today its earnings power is closer to $11 a share, not $13.  As we continued in our attempts to kill GILD’s business during the quarter, we simply failed to do so.

16-11-15,5d0g4s,Thoughts on bond allocation with the present interest rate/post-election environment?,"As many people do, I use ETFs to achieve my overall asset allocation with low fees and to get good diversification. Currently, my bond portfolio is composed of a mix of AGG and BND, which are government and investment grade bond ETFs with ~5 year avg maturity. The downside of using bond funds is the lack of principal protection compared to holding the bonds themselves. Given that the fed is likely to raise rates in December (reducing the share value of bond ETFs), and Trump seems to be planning on deficit spending like crazy (implying that government bond interest rates will rise further), I'm concerned about capital erosion with my current strategy. 

I have been considering diversifying my bond allocation by using investment grade or government shorter term (1-3 year) ETFs to reduce my interest rate sensitivity, or purchasing some 5 year TIPS in the next auction. 

What, if anything, are you doing to your bond portfolio in this market?

If it affects your thoughts, my portfolio is 80% stocks/10% bonds/10% REITs in Roth. ",1

(*wall street bets*) sub-reddit was down for a few brief housekeeping duties this evening; including the long-awaited removal of the despised /u/automoderator overlord. During this interlude, the mods decided to have a little contest and as the winner of said contest, it will shortly (hopefully within the day; I know getting those little plaques engraved takes time and they have to order more embossed letterhead so I understand) be proclaimed across the community that I have ascended to the seat of power and will be filling the vacuum left after the storm of tyranny. 
We'll be changing a few things in the coming days and as always, I welcome your feedback. 

- New posts will be automatically x-posted to /r/trollhumpers and /r/trollfappers. Also, any subscriber to /r/wallstreetbets will be expected, but not required, to subscribe to our new neighbors. This is a political strategy to strengthen our brigading power on other subs, and also should help us defend ourselves from /r/botsrights attacks. 

-We're not comfortable calling it a ""tax"" but a small monetary tribute to show respect for the effort on behalf of mods will be assessed to any posts meeting two (2) of the following three (3) criteria

1. ATTAINING a number of upvotes equal to or exceeding one-hundred and fifty (150)
2. CONTAINING references to subjects addressed in three (3) or more other posts on the front page
3. ELICITING a number of comments equal to or greater than ninety five (95)

The exact amount and mechanism for the collection of said fee is TBD but our numbers indicate that less than 4% of subscribers will be impacted by this (proposed) rule. 

We will use no less than twenty five (25) percent (%) of generated funds to provide a more inclusive experience for our subscribers:

A monthly contest will be held to update the banner according to popular opinion, with user submitted options. 

The native background music will be changed to Dale Watson's ""Loose nut behind the wheel"" and ""Good luck and good truckin' tonight"" in rotation. 

Several other opportunities are also in discussion. We welcome your ideas! 

Anyway, just wanted to say thanks again for your time and I'm proud to represent you; the common people; on the mod team. Reach out to me anytime. Especially with your pecker. 


**EDIT** on second thought I might have had too much milk for dinner and I'll be needing to head to bed or the toilet shortly; so you can go ahead and forward your ideas/peckers to the other mods in the meantime. especially your peckers. they love that. we all do.

Maybe even give your take on if you think it is good to get in at this point?

edit: so people are asking.  My buddy recommended looking into these stocks as they are 2 x stocks that are owned by people the likes of Carl Icahn and Richard Parry who are advisers to trump.  Since these 2 stocks were essentially stolen by the US government during the bailout from all of the stock owners, with Trump now in office he will obviously push hard to have the stock given back to the stock holders which would obviously be beneficial to Perry and Icahn.  The stock valuations should be more around $20 and $25 respective but are selling for around 1/5th of that now.  My buddy did mention fully that this a gamble as you have no idea what roadblocks but I see it as a pretty good gamble.  The way I see it is Perry, Icahn and Trump are all good buddies and now that Trump is the ultimate power over the Feds that essentially stole the company, you gotta think he's going to get this company back to the stock holders.

Do places like Ren Tech just demand (and get, as a client of their size and prestige) brokers to sign the legal-castration, iron-clad holy grail of NDAs? Do hedge funds have other provisions in place to make sure that their strategies are not copied and stolen? 

A couple tag-along questions if any of you are feeling generous:

1. Do HFT firms have to go through brokers too? If so, how are they staying ahead of traditional hedge funds vis a vis speed?
2. In the name of secrecy, couldn't you just set up your own private brokerage operations? I imagine once you're tossing around billions in assets it would be worthwhile to have your entire operation in-house.

Chipotle (CMG) - chipotle shares have rallied 14% past week since it hit a bottom after the ecoli issues with their meat supplier.  Hedge fund manager bill Ackman has started a 10% stake in the company and wants to get on the board.  there is a lot of upside for chipotle given that the stock was battered after same store sales fell after the ecoli problems but overall revenue continued to grow.  

Tech stocks (FB, AAPL, NFLX, GOOG) - this whole sector has taken a beating from the uncertainty in immigration policy which affects their labor force and the inevitable collapse of TPP which would have given these companies monopoly in Asian markets.  These may take longer to recover but they are a great investment and a value play.  The share prices are quite high so using far dated call options might be a better way to go long on these stocks.  

Risky speculative plays - Do not put in anything you cannot afford to lose completely.  These stocks are going up due to speculation but with incredible volume which means there is still more upside

Fannie Mae (FNMA) - A leaked trump tax record shows he owns a few million in Fannie Mae stock.  Rumors are his administration will eventually bring FNMA out of government conservatorship and make it private again.  Also housing and mortgages have recovered since 2008, in fact some suggest we are back in a real estate bubble caused by outside money bidding up properties as a place to park cash.  

Shipping stocks (DRYS, SINO, ESEA, TOPS) - all shipping stocks have rallied hard this last week, DRYS being the strongest but also most overbought.  The Baltic dry index has surged in November signaling a return to shipping activity which peaked in 2008 pre recession.  These shares have bled out since then and hit near term lows.  Since then these companies have stripped down and cut fat to be profitable with decreased revenue.  With the low cost of oil, increase in shipping, and trumps vow to increase manufacturing the market is speculating that shipping will be making much more revenue in the future.  

Biotech (LABU, ARRY, CLVS) - biotech was getting battered the weeks leading up to the election with Hilary's forecasted win and her vow to control drug pricing.  Now with trump these regulations are no longer an uncertainty and biotech is rallying.  LABU is a 3x leveraged biotech ETF that went from 25 to 45 in less than a week after Trumps victory.  ARRY and CLVS are two of my favorite biotech plays with a strong pipeline for cancer drugs.

My question is this: if someone is against Trump's policies, but not necessarily against a company that has recently gone up as an (in?)direct result of Trump being elected, is it good or bad to invest in that company? For example, Navient, (and let me preface this with saying I don't know a ton about this company) went up 25+% in just a couple days after the election. 

If someone wants nothing to do with supporting Trump, would investing in a company like Navient that could benefit from a Trump presidency be going against their moral beliefs? Even if the company itself isn't terrible?

I'd like to add a few more points:

1. The $7500 electric car subsidy only applies to the first 200k electric cars sold. It will start phasing out after that point and will be completely gone after selling 350k cars. Tesla will pass that point sometime after early 2018, and the market should have priced in this fact long time ago.

2. Current federal solar subsidy or rather the [Solar Investment Tax Credit](http://www.seia.org/sites/default/files/ITC%20101%20Fact%20Sheet%20-%2004-19-2016.pdf) was passed end last year. It's good at least until 2020, and overturning it will not be easy. 

3. Even without any subsidies, solar is competitive in many states, and the cost of solar is still dropping.

Hard to believe, but am new to NVDA. So apologies for the layman's view!

Latest price | $87.97
Value | $47,064M
Daily vol | $1,337M

* Website: [nvidia.com](http://www.nvidia.com)

# Description

At their core they are *just* another semiconductor business. But as they say themselves:

&gt; NVIDIA is the world leader in visual computing.

And what does that mean?

&gt; a specialized platform company that targets four large markets - Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive - where (Nvidia) brings together hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, systems and services to create unique value for the markets we serve.

i.e. Gaming companies create fantasy / virtual realities. Designers create visual effects for movies, or design new products. researchers can do simulations. Datacenters are able to increase performance and power efficiency. And the auto-industry is using their tech in autonomous cars.

In terms of reporting their sales they have two divisions

* GPU (that's graphics processing units) which is their main business to 3 verticals: Gaming, Professional &amp; Datacenters
* Tegra which ""integrates an entire computer onto a single chip"" and is sold to mobile business &amp; the Automotive industry

You won't be surprised given Gaming on PC is so established and autonomous cars are in their infancy that 75% of sales related to PC platforms. And... their largest client at 11% of sales is ASUSTeK Computer Inc.  

And the final thing to note about the business, is that NVDA is a fabless semi business. i.e. it doesn't have any factories itself, outsourcing production. It's really more on intellectual property business. And unsurprisingly 6.5k of the 9k employees are in the R&amp;D division!

## Recent financials 

The last 5 years started off tough with sales only getting going in the last 3 years...

|Jan period end|2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $5.0bn | $4.7bn | $4.1bn | $4.3bn | $4.0bn|
|EPS | $1.08 | $1.12 | $0.74 | $0.90 | $0.94|

But the ""breakout"" really came this year with the forecast, for year ending Jan 2017, of $6.8bn in sales and an adjusted EPS of $2.41. Wow... that's nearly $2bn of extra sales... with a lot of it dropping to the bottom line.

Though oddly, Wall Street's not expecting another ramp in the year ending Jan 2018 expecting $7.7bn of sales. Am wondering, if sales are accelerating now, what's to stop the business power on... was this year a one off?

## Competition

Nvidia divides it's competition into 

&gt; Our current competitors include:

&gt; * suppliers of discrete and integrated GPUs, including supercomputers and chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;
&gt; * suppliers of SOC products that are embedded into automobiles and smart devices such as televisions, monitors, set-top boxes, gaming devices and automobiles, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Apple, Inc., Avago Technologies Ltd., Intel, Marvell Technology Group Ltd., Mediatek, Mobileye N.V., Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung, ST Microelectronics, and Texas Instruments Incorporated; and
&gt; * licensors of graphics technologies, such as ARM Holdings plc, or ARM, and Imagination Technologies Group plc.

So looking at margins and returns, they are clearly in the same zone as Intel, Qualcomm and Mobileye... though are far from best in class. Perhaps that indicates there's room for further margin expansion?

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
NVIDIA Corporation | $6,138M | 27% | 25%
Ambarella Inc | $283M | 18% | 13%
Apple Inc. | $215,639M | 33% | 37%
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. | $4,124M | -8% | -ve
Intel Corporation | $57,927M | 39% | 17%
Marvell Technology Group Ltd. | $2,458M | 4% | -1%
Mobileye NV | $301M | 35% | 18%
QUALCOMM, Inc. | $23,554M | 35% | 18%
STMicroelectronics NV (ADR) | $6,781M | 13% | 1%
Texas Instruments Incorporated | $13,145M | 44% | 32%

## Cash / Debt?

NVIDIA has $3,626M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 8% of the market value. Far from atypical in Tech to run cash positions, so nothing to worry about here.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $83.60 for NVIDIA Corporation and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies a downside of 5% to their target. Weird eh? A *Buy* but the target price is lower! 

Is this a case of Wall Street brokers being behind the curve? 3 months ago the consensus price target was $64 when the stock was at $63. *fail, Wall Street*!

# Valuation

The only business that's pricier is Mobileye. Surprise eh? 

And when I look at it's market value on $47bn versus Qualcomm on $99bn, it feels odd. Okay the growth is amazing, but what's so bad about Qualcomm (and Intel) for that matter. Even if they are ex-growth...

...oh the shame of being late to this story :(. 

# Dividends

NVIDIA Corporation is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.48 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $0.35 per share. That is a 37% growth. The forecast dividend of $0.48 compares to a forecast EPS of $2.41.

On top of dividends, the company's a fan of repurchasing stock. Just seems like they've not found any acquisition targets for their cash pile / cash machine. Either they are very disciplined, are the bees-knees at R&amp;D and can build it all themselves... or management doesn't see a tangential business to expand into. Regardless, it's not a reason to complain. Keep the cash coming, boys!

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 40% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 32%. On a 1 year view the stocks up 200% v earnings forecasts up 130%. Clearly there's some ""valuation"" inflation coming thro'.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, the CEO / founder was asked to explain what was driving the growth. It's rather a lot of techno-babble but it's worth thinking thro'

&gt; * First of all, GPU computing...we've essentially taken very compute-intensive, very graphics-intensive applications, virtualizing it and putting it into the datacenter.
&gt; * the thing that really made it possible was really the transformation of our company from a graphics processor to a general purpose processor. And then, on top of that, probably the more important part of that, is transforming from a chip company to a platform company
&gt; * And with GPU acceleration, the benefit is incredible. It's not 20%, it's not 50%, it's 20 times, 50 times.

So, Nvidia is making computing faster and more power efficient. It expands dramatically what you can do (gaming, autonomous cars, etc) and where you can do it (in smaller and smaller more mobile devices).

It's easy to see why this technology is important. But I feel like I missed the boat. The contrarian in me is worried by the number of requests for this stock and commentary on r/investing. 

# Napkin Math

But to go the extra mile, let's reach for the cafe napkin, trust in Wall Street's forecasts and look out into the distant future. Sure valuations of high fliers like NVDA come back to earth, but the growth is so strong, why'd you care.

|Companies|PE ratio|Growth|Divie|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
NVIDIA | 37x | 25% | 1%
Intel | 13x | 10% | 3%
Qualcomm | 14x | 11% | 3%

If NVDA going to see it's valuation return to a market rating in the long-term, then the 25% earnings from will turn into high-teens gains, as the PE compresses. In contrast, INTL and QCOM are trading below a market rating. But a re-rating aside, if they eek out low double digit growth in earnings and keep a high divie, their long-term gains is almost the same.

|Companies|Gain = |Change in Valuation + |Growth + |yield|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
NVIDIA | 18% = |-8% + | 25% + | 1%
Intel | 16% = | 3% + | 10% + | 3%
Qualcomm | 16% = | 2% + | 11% + | 3%

So, I can take the hot stock and hold it for 10 years or the old men and get to the same place. Assuming Wall Street's good at forecasting. An assumption that's proved unreliable in the past. ;)

Perhaps I should consider a tangential bet? e.g. [Citrix](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/ctxs.o) or [VMware](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/vmw) if the virtualization story is key. Any takers?

16-11-15,5d4h07,Understanding selling covered calls,"So the number I've heard tossed around is that only 17% of options end up actually being exercised. The rest either expire worthless or else are bought/sold to close before expiration.

Otherwise, all options in-the-money at expiration are automatically exercised, correct? So, if I've sold a covered call and if I haven't closed it before expiration and is in-the-money, my shares *will* 100% for sure be called away? Thus, if I want to keep my shares, I will have to buy back the call I sold at a loss. 

But, if I understand this correctly, I could ""kick the can down the road"" so to speak, rolling the trade out by buying back the call and selling a new call for a higher strike price, thus minimizing my loss and locking in a higher gain on the stock itself if it continues rising.

So in the end, selling covered calls is really a neutral sort of strategy, where you're hoping the stock doesn't actually rise or fall, but stays the same?

16-11-15,5d4hq0,A call for help to my degenerate master yoloers (not suicidal hotline),"Hello WSB,
I know that ya'll aren't very fond of paper trading, but for my broke-ass 21 y.o. self there's quite a few tendies involved.

So here's the deal. I entered a 2-week online stock simulation at a local university. Entering the competition was a profitable move in itself because there are $2500 in prizes for top 3 portfolios but only 50ish participants that paid $20 to get in (so every ticket is actually worth an expected value of $50 - yes I know, the event organizers are retarded).  

Anyway, I was expecting this shit to be soft as fuck, with these student plebs trading AAPL and AMZN and gaining max 2-3% over the competition's 2 weeks duration. So I paid for multiple accounts (under friends' names lol) and was planning to simply do directional options play on XYZ earnings with 50% of my accounts being bullish and 50% being bearish. Obviously half of my 6 accounts would've gone to 0, but half of them would've won 1st-2nd-3rd place. Anyway that was the plan..

To my fucking surprise, after 1 day of trading, 3 participants actually went from $100k to $400k+. I don't know what kind of stupid weed stock they got to play options with, but they got lucky as fuck and are about to win first place because of it.

So here's my question: does anyone have an idea for an options play before Friday the 25th that might return 400-500% (obviously this ain't real money so I can tolerate huge-ass risks; I just want the best shot at quadrupling and winning top 3 in the competition). I can try up to 6 different plays since I have 6 accounts.

Technical details: I can only go long on options (can't write them) and long/short on stocks. Also can't trade more than 40% of a security's daily volume so I can't buy options on a stock with my whole portfolio if the daily volume is like only 200 contracts.

If I win any money in the tournament it will all go into some OTM option on the most upvoted stock (will post proof).

Thanks a lot my dear fagg0ts.

TLDR: I have 6 shots at achieving 500% returns in the next 2 weeks. What's my best bet?",9

16-11-15,5d4k7z,Business is too good to be true,"I recently made a huge discovery through stocks, exchange rate and economic market that will change investing forever. I found a legit way and safe way to make ~18% * Monthly return on investment. I make little more than double my investments amount in just 6 months.

Obviously I don't want to take this public because I can make a lot of money off this methode first before making it public. So I started an investing business throwing a shit load of money into legalizing the website and now that I want to start moving forward and advertising investment business people think its to good to be true. I advertise that I will only give them 16.67% monthly return on investment. That means my company makes 1.33% monthly commission on the other peoples initial investment thats more than enough for me but I obviously don't tell them that. That is a small cut I take for all the work I am doing and giving them high monthly investment returns.

My problem is that people think that my business is a fraud and too good to be true due to the high investment return. What should I do I can always lower the investment amouts and take more monthly commission but I feel thats too much and people deserves high investment returns. Being honest with people is bad for business and taking more does not feel right. 

Does anyone have any ideas?",0
16-11-15,5d4kbx,"Why do people here almost always believe that a drop in stock prices means a ""buying opportunity""???","We see this comment made nearly every day when either the overall market or some company's stock tanks. It's a mindless, knee-jerk reaction. I realize that in a strongly up trending market (as we've seen in the past several years), this will tend to be a good strategy. The only difficulty, of course, is that it's backward looking as we don't know what the trend will be in the future with high confidence. What's going to happen to all the Millennial monkeys out there who have been conditioned by their limited experience to act a certain way when markets change?

A very simple framework for thinking about all this (from Campbell, Grossman, and Wang) is as follows:

*In this paper we use data on stock market trading volume to help solve this identification problem. The simple intuition underlying our work is as follows. Suppose that one observes a fall in stock prices. This could be due to public information that has caused all investors to reduce their valuation of the stock market, or it could be due to exogenous selling pressure by noninformational traders. In the former case, there is no reason why the expected return on the stock market should have changed. In the latter case, market makers buying stock will require a higher expected return, so there will tend to be price increases on subsequent days. The two cases can be distinguished by looking at trading volume. If public information has arrived, there is no reason to expect a high volume of trade, whereas selling pressure by noninformational traders must reveal itself in unusual volume.*

When they say **identification problem** that's economist-speak for distinguishing between different cases. Namely did stocks go down for informational or non-informational reasons? So for all you buy-the-dip traders out there, this is fundamentally what you need to sort out if you want to be out there providing liquidity to the market. They use trading volume, but there are various things you might consider.

# Description

CSX Corporation provides rail-based transportation services, including rail service and the transport of intermodal containers and trailers. 

* The Company's merchandise business consists of shipments in diverse markets, such as agricultural products, phosphates and fertilizers, food and consumer, chemicals, automotive, metals, forest products, minerals, and waste and equipment. 
* The Company's coal business transports domestic coal, coke and iron ore to electricity-generating power plants, steel manufacturers and industrial plants, as well as exports coal to deep-water port facilities. 
* The Company's intermodal business combines the rail transportation with the short-haul flexibility of trucks and offers long-haul trucking.

So it looks like the perfect cyclical play on the economic recovery.

## Recent financials 

Sales have been stable for the last 5 years, profits too, which is a surprise to me. And the management's been busily buying back stock that's helped drive up earnings per share.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $11.8bn | $12.7bn | $10.0bn | $11.8bn | $11.8bn|
|Operating Profit | $3.6bn | $3.6bn | $3.5bn | $3.5bn | $3.5bn|
|EPS | $2.00 | $1.92 | $1.83 | $1.79 | $1.70|
|DPS | $0.70 | $0.63 | $0.59 | $0.54 | $0.45|

And looking at the figures for the first 9 months, point to a flat to declining topline and margin. So it's really strange to see the stock has performed really will this year!

## Competition

In their annual they say

&gt; The business environment in which the Company operates is highly competitive.  Shippers typically select transportation providers that offer the most compelling combination of service and price.  Service requirements, both in terms of transit time and reliability, vary by shipper and commodity. As a result, the Company’s primary competition varies by commodity, geographic location and mode of available transportation and includes other railroads, motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. CSXT’s primary rail competitor is Norfolk Southern Railway, which operates throughout much of the Company’s territory.  

In fact there really aren't a lot of railroad companies to benchmark them against. Though we can see that their margins and returns are in line with their key competitor NSC.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
CSX Corporation | $10,813M | 41% | 15%
Union Pacific Corporation | $19,981M | 46% | 21%
Norfolk Southern Corp. | $9,916M | 40% | 13%
Kansas City Southern | $2,334M | 48% | 12%

## Cash / Debt?

CSX Corporation has $9,764M of net debt. That is 2.2x it's latest operating profit. So nothing much to worry about here.

# Wall Street thinks?

Oddly, The professionals on Wall Street have a $32.34 for CSX which is 7% below the current price... but their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. It's as if the brokers haven't updated their forecasts! Or worse, they are upgrading and upgrading to keep up with the stock price's rise. :(

# Valuation

Wow are the valuations bunched... and they aren't far off the ""asset light"" logistics businesses UPS on 19x and Fedex on 15x times forecast sales.

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/csx.o/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
CSX.O | $32,577M | 19x | 6% | 2% | 11%
UNP | $81,942M | 20x | 7% | 2% | 10%
NSC | $30,359M | 19x | 11% | 2% | 11%
KSU | $9,155M | 19x | 9% | 2% | 10%

So, it doesn't feel expensive, but it still feels strange that the prices have ramped even though the earnings aren't increasing.

Why is the market re-rating the railroads?

# Dividends

CSX Corporation is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.73 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $0.70 per share. The forecast dividend of $0.73 compares to a forecast EPS of $1.79.

And on top of dividends CSX likes buying back stock too.

# Catalysts

So here's where I start to scratch my head:

* In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 24% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 3%.
* In the last 6 months the stock price has moved by 38% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 1%.
* the forecast for 2017 is for $1.97 of earnings versus $1.79 today, i.e. up 10%

So why on earth has the valuation gone from 14x earnings to 19x earnings in the last 6 months when the business...seen sales off 11% in the last 9 months and earnings down 16%.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers they said

&gt; Overall our business continues to reflect a market environment driven by low crude oil, natural gas and broader commodity prices as well as continued strength in the U.S. dollar.

So what am I missing, if this a tangential play on a recovering oil price? On a more friendly oil price?

16-11-16,5d7ses,Looking for book that focuses on the logic and mathematics behind indicators *pivot point example inside,"I'm looking for a book / books that focus on the mathematics behind technical indicators and the logic behind why that calculation can give us an insight into a market. I don't want a vague one sentence interpretation followed by 10 pages of set ups using the indicator, I want to know the deep relationship behind the math and the connection to financial markets. 

For instance I recently learnt about PivotPoints from: 

*J. Person - A Complete Guide to Technical Trading Tactics(2004)* 

on P96 he writes in under the section title ""BEHIND THE ANALYSIS"" 

*""Here is my interpretation for the rationale behind the calculations. Consider the pivot point as the average of the previous session’s trading range combined with the closing price. The numbers of support and resistance that are calculated indicate the potential ranges for the next time frame, based on the past weight of the market’s strength or weakness derived from calculating the high, low, and distance from the close of those points.""*

That's it, that's all he says about why the calculation is appropriate for determining resistance and support levels and what it's actually doing. 

I'm still confused as to why the pivot points suggest areas of resistance / support given the calculation. 

For instance here's a look into the calculation I did for the S&amp;P500. The pivots point and sequential res and sups are drawn from the previous monthly candles:

[Monthly view](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Ygo8qvMh/) 

I then zoomed into the daily and show how R1 and R2 are calculated: 

[Daily view](https://www.tradingview.com/x/eICmoetB/) 

R1 = P + P - L

The best way I can interpret this is that P - L shows a 'recovery' ie it was the amount the market recovered by (for the previous month) from the low to the pivot point.
R1 then equals the pivot point + this recovery. Why is resistance given by how much the market recovered by + the pivot point. ""the market made a move this big before so it could do it again"" ????? is the best i could come up with 

Then we look at R2

R2 = P + H - L 

here the term H - L could be viewed as the range in which price traded (for the previous month) 
Then R2 is defined by the Pivot + the previous range. ""the market moved in the range before so a potential resistance point could be this range + the pivot"" where is the logic behind this ?  

If any one could offer some insight into pivots that would be great, but I'm really looking for a book that explains this plus other TA indicators 

I'm also very interested in market structure and reading candles if anyone has a good suggestions for those such books ",1

16-11-15,5d4y4c,Insanity in the Canadian Cannabis Stocks,"Marijuana stocks went ballistic this year and the valuations have become completely detached from reality. The table below shows the growth rate required by each of the listed players in the industry if we are to assume that the current market value is an accurate representation of their future size. The assumption is that the growth rate and profitability will match that of the market at large by year 10.

P/S (assumed): 2.00

P/S (S&amp;P 500): 1.91

P/S (TSX): 1.74

https://imgur.com/a/o6X6i

Are those numbers possible? Sure, there are currently [88](http://imgur.com/ILUXya4) companies on Canadian markets that have revenue growth rates of at least ~31% per year for the last 10 years. But that's out of an investable universe of ~2,600 stocks or about 3.3% of all listed companies have growth at this rate.

Of those 88, [only 23](http://imgur.com/3jdrVHl) have market caps greater than $120 Million and only [51](http://imgur.com/eNo0EeL) have positive EBITDA margins.

Qualitatively, the legislation on which all this growth is pegged has not even been announced. We don't know how the system will be set up, the price controls, regulatory burden, distribution systems or whether the legalisation for medical purposes will actually lead to legalisation for recreational purposes.

SO, make sure you step into this madness eyes wide open, because this industry is running on thinner ice than an ice skater in Texas",21

I am a 24 year old male who is looking to start investing. My aunt setup up a brokerage account for me and I was young to give me when I graduate college. I now have my brokerage account and it has $1.1k in it. A private financial advisor told me I should setup a commissionable trade on my brokerage account to avoid the $50 annual fee. He said the minimum amount I should put in is $100 monthly or annually. My question is should I setup an commissionable trade on my brokerage account with $100 monthly, should I do more, or should I $100 or more annually? There are other ways of removing the fee such as having a minimum of $25k in all my accounts which I do not have. I also believe that my account is an aggressive type which means they put my money is stocks that have a little more risk. I am meeting with a financial advisor Friday so I would like to know what I should do before then. Thanks

BTW I bank with chase.

This company is worthless. It is, in fact, liquidizing. The reason for the huge up tick (I have to imagine) is due to the company largely reverse splitting. In turn, this company will sell off its valuable assets. When their debt is gone, expect them to liquidize and no longer exist. If you got in a while ago when you needed 150k to own 10% of the company, you could be filthy rich right now.  To everyone buying at 40+ thinking this stock will hit thousands, you are playing a very dangerous game. Be forewarned!

16-11-15,5d2zit,Winthrop Realty Trust (FUR) Liquidation,[removed],1
16-11-15,5d2zl2,Winthrop Realty Trust (FUR) Liquidation,"When does a public company liquidate? The answer is …. not very often!  Management has a vested interest in keeping a business alive at all costs, since in a liquidation they lose their job. In fact, more often than not management continues to drain the coffers of ‘their’ company over many years rather than make the shareholder-friendly decision to liquidate, drawing a salary while the owners are gradually swindled of their equity. Even when equity and cash have been completely depleted, management can still make out like bandits; in a chapter 11 filing management most often oversees the liquidation, keep their jobs even after the company emerges from bankruptcy, and sometimes even get to reset all their non-salary remuneration thresholds (options, grants, bonuses, etc.) giving them greater upside. I find this a rather strange phenomenon since bankruptcy is more often than not the fault of very management that benefits.

So when do liquidations happen? Mostly they take place when either management is itself a significant shareholder, and the benefits of liquidation for management are greater than the continuing stream of cash from remuneration, or when there are significant non-management shareholders who force management to put the company into liquidation. Note that I haven’t cited the Board of Directors as a catalyst for liquidation. That’s because most Boards’ first allegiance is to management. After all, they generally owe their jobs to management and they too have a vested interest in keeping the company alive so they can remain Board members. It’s only when Board members have significant ownership in the company (and this is VERY unusual) that they actually look out for the shareholders (themselves, obviously). Otherwise it takes an activist investor to ‘shame’ the Board into providing the shareholder guarantees that they are legally bound to provide. And I really mean ‘shame’ since Board members are protected against monetary claims from shareholder legal action by mandatory insurance policies. It is thus only the potential damage to a Board member’s reputation that is at stake. This can, however, be a decisive factor, depending on who the Board members are. In the case of Winthrop Realty Trust (FUR), fortunately for shareholders, management was/is a major shareholder.

The issue I want to address here is what happened to the FUR stock price AFTER the announcement of a liquidation, with the goal of identifying in hindsight when the best time to invest might have been. Clearly this is a specific instance of liquidation, and the results cannot be used as guidelines for what to do in other situations. Nevertheless, I think there may be some lessons we can draw from this situation that we might apply to another potential liquidation I am following, the proposed liquidation of New York Realty Trust (which I will address in the next post).

Back to the liquidation of Winthrop Realty Trust. In November 2013, approx. 6 months before the liquidation announcement, FUR management provided, a NAV estimate of between $12.98 (low) and $15.01 (high). At the time, shares were trading at $11.15. On April 29, 2014 the company issued a press release stating that the Board had approved a plan of liquidation, but did not provide any estimate of liquidation proceeds. There was only a statement that the liquidation proceeds for common shareholders would not be less than the lower end of NAV estimated as of the end of the first quarter, $13.79 per share.  The share price traded up to the $14-$15 range. The Proxy statement requesting shareholder approval for the liquidation, first issued in mid-May, continued to use the first quarter NAV estimates of liquidation proceeds, $13.79 to $15.79 per share. Shareholder approval was given at the annual meeting on August 4. On November 6 a press release was issued announcing 3rd quarter results. These results used liquidation accounting for the first time and per-common-share liquidation proceeds were estimated at $18.16, subsequently increased to $18.35 later that month. On the announcement, the share price traded up to the $17-$18 range. Since then, estimates for liquidation proceeds have been included in each quarterly report but have not varied significantly. The latest estimate of liquidation distributions, made in late July 2016, was for $10.61 per share (which excluded $7.75 per share in previous distributions). In 2015 three liquidating distributions were made, $2.25, $1.25 and $1.00 per share, respectively on 1/15, 6/16 and 12/3.  A $2.00 per share liquidation distribution was made in May 2016 after which shares traded down from $12.50 to the $10.50 – $9.62 range. At $9.62 on June 17, shares were trading at a significant discount to estimated future distributions of $11.85, about $19%. A further $1.25 distribution was made at the end of June. Reflecting this distribution, shares traded down to $8.62 in late June after the ex distribution date (though note that they never traded down the entire amount of the distribution) and there was another opportunity to purchase at about an 18% discount to estimated future distributions. After this distribution, shares traded around $8.70, gradually increasing to $9.14 over the month of July, still a significant discount to estimated liquidation proceeds, up to 18% early in the month. On August 5 the shares were delisted (2 years after the approval of the liquidation) and the assets transferred into a liquidating trust with the result that the shareholders became participants in this trust with non-transferable shares.

So, when was the best time to purchase shares in FUR subsequent to the liquidation announcement? The best time, in retrospect, was just after the announcement was made in May 2014 when the shares traded up from $11 to $14 per share. However, it must be remembered that no official estimate of liquidation proceeds had been made at that time. When the first management estimates of liquidation distributions were made in the Fall of 2014, the shares popped to between $17 and $18. In retrospect that was the WORST time to buy. Over the next 18 months the share price gradually receded, and if one waited until  30 to 75 days before the assets were put into the liquidating trust on Aug 5, 2016 this would have been the second best time to buy. The discount to management’s conservative estimate of liquidation proceeds was between 15% and 20% during that period.  I assume the discount widened to the 15-20% range when it became clear that liquidation was not going to be completed before the 2 year deadline, i.e. the remaining assets were going to be put in a liquidating trust. Certain holders would be forced to sell as institutional  mandates would preclude them from holding illiquid securities such as the participating interests in the FUR liquidating trust.

I had made a small initial investment in FUR at the end of 2014, adding to it at the end of 2015, with the idea that I would double or triple this amount opportunistically as the liquidation progressed. I viewed the August 5th trust conversion as such an opportunity, but, of course, I BLEW IT!  I purchased more shares in May (not a bad time) but then waited to double down until July when I thought institutional investors would all be running for the exit at once as they were forced to sell. This was my mistake; I was too greedy!! I was totally wrong on the timing! During July the share price gradually increased. I now have to concede that institutions were much more proactive than I anticipated, selling at least 2 to 3 months before the shares became illiquid. Needless to say I was sorely disappointed. In retrospect I can see that I invested too early, with single figure discounts to liquidation estimates, and then waited too long to make further purchases.

I console myself with the thought that the purpose of this investment was simply to park funds in a low risk situation that would provide liquidity in a couple of years when I hope the investment scenario will be more favorable. And, as always, better an error of omission than commission!

I initially invested $2500 into a Robinhood account and half of it is in an S&amp;P500 index, and the other is in a few established companies I researched. So far I am up about 7% so all is good.

I have about $10,000 more in a savings account and I want to invest $7500 of that. By the way, I have no debts and I fully understand and subscribe to the ""if you lose everything, make sure it does not break you."" I am in a position where I can take on this risk. After this, each month I want to take most of my monthly post expenses income and add to my principal.

However before I do this, I want to read more. So far I have read A Random Walk Down Wall Street and The Richest Man in Babylon, and next up is Security Analysis and The Intelligent Investor. 

However, so far I am gathering that I should add bonds to this next $7500 investment to diversify my portfolio. I want to take 17% of that (and every monthly addition from income) and invest in 5-year T Bonds, expecting to fully ride them out and not sell early. I just fear that this may be silly with how low interest rates are now and the expectation for them to increase. However, considering I plan to continually buy more each month, and that I plan to hold them, does it really matter? I am a bit confused and unsure if I am making a bad decision so I thought I would ask here.

16-11-16,5d6mk6,"not good with money but have $630K, what to do with it?","My apologies if I am asking obtuse questions or if this is the wrong subreddit (I had originally posted in Investing Discussion but think this is a better place?)...

A little about me... I am 50, single female (two kids, age 14 and 11). I started a small business about 5 years ago and my income fluctuates as there is a sales component but expecting to make about $100k this year. Would expect my income range to vary between $75k and $125k.

I am consolidating funds into Schwab where I have had an account since the 1990's. Two 401(k)'s that were in two different places are worth about $285k and I have moved them both to Schwab. I have about $45k of stock in the Schwab account (microsoft and adobe). I recently deposited $300k into the Schwab account - right now it is cash until I can figure out what to do.

I was thinking if I could inform myself well enough, that I could keep all the money at Schwab and invest it in a variety of ways. How well can I do with my limited ability/interest in money managing? That's the question, which leads me to my next... Is there value in turning the money over to an investment professional who will more actively manage it than I can myself? Would the fees I pay this person be covered by their ability to earn more with the money than I could on my own via the Schwab account? (I realize that's not a question with an easy answer).

If I were to keep it at Schwab, some things I am considering:

** $100k in a higher risk robo (intelligent portfolio) - 77% stocks, 11% fixed income, 4.7% commodities, 7.3% cash. Opt in for tax loss harvesting??? (I don't really understand this... wouldn't I want to make as much as possible?)

** $100k in Thomas Partners Dividend Growth Strategy (100% equities and will cost $900 per year) but projects higher returns than the Balanced Income Strategy (60% equities / 40% fixed income, costs $800 per year).

** $50K in cash - maybe I find a CD or something that can give me some sort of return but keep it fairly liquid since my income fluctuates as a small business owner.

** $45k - keep the microsoft and adobe as my cost basis is $11k and I am paralyzed about having to pay capital gains tax on it.

** $285k in 401(k) money - maybe another robo but less risky than the one I suggested above but is that too much in cash? (61% stocks, 23.5% fixed income, 5% commodities, 10.5% cash).

** balance - play around with it - maybe some ETF's or stocks, etc.

I have been trying so hard to educate myself so that I can make prudent decisions. I will be attending a workshop tomorrow night to learn more about the Thomas Partners option. My friend is suggesting I meet with the guy that is managing her money as she is happy with what he is doing for her but I am reluctant to commit to that without learning more about investing as I feel I would be blindly handing it over and that doesn't feel quite right to me.

Any broad or specific advise you can offer would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",2

16-11-16,5d6oyg,SFOR - the time is nigh,"Strikeforce has been on a rollercoaster over the past few months.  It was over-hyped on potential litigation/settlement/buyout news.  All of this is still very possible, but it is at reasonable or less-than-reasonable levels now and is subject to pop.

They did have a settlement with MSFT earlier this year and it's highly likely that SFOR is now being licensed in the Azure package.  Current litigation is against three companies and is into the discovery phase.  So, settlement could come at anytime, and also they could have offers made for a buyout.  While this could happen at anytime, that's not all there is to the story.

Their base revenue, while still not profitable, has been steadily increasing.  Q1 - Q2 showed a 66% increase.  Since then there is the strong possibility of the Azure deal.  There are also hints at other big deals, any one of which would be a game changer.  But still that's not why I'm excited.  

66% increased revenue last quarter (without all of these potential fireworks) AND the tangible thing that's happened since then is that the product is now carried everywhere you'd expect, such as Amazon, Target, Office Depot, etc., etc.  

So you've got a pink sheet with a real product and a growing trend line, plus visibly increased exposure on the marketplace.  Plus all these fireworks around patents and large contracts as a bonus.  

Results were due yesterday but they filed a 5 day extension.  This Friday at 4pm is a very rare in-person share holder's meeting.  Most likely results will be released at that time.  

There are many non-exclusive plays here.  Just by continuing a trend of revenue growth I could see it easily rest at .008 (from a current .0046) after a run-up.  If there have been large contracts signed and executed in this quarter, and revenues show that, it rests higher after a higher initial bump.  

My thoughts are that the end-of-year, as well as Q4 results (due in Feb/Mar) will also provide higher floors for this.  Obviously a lot depends on what deals were made, when they were made, etc.  

And then on top of it all, they could get large settlements and/or buy-out offers along the way.  

Please do your own DD on this to fact check me.  And of course - my optimism is my opinion.  However, I think time is running out to get in on this next play.  Three days left.",18

16-11-16,5d77dm,DD: $TWLO perfect setup and timing for a short squeeze moved 10% yesterday. - 10-40% additional move expected,"You may not know about this little unicorn stock. I didn't. In fact I had to ask a friend, ""Do we even need this company?""

They describe themselves as, a ""Cloud communications platform for building SMS, Voice &amp; Messaging applications on an API built for global scale."" I didn't know we needed that, but I guess we do.

The shorts are banking on the longs giving up, and this going to $20. They stand to make millions. Do you want to give some Hedge-funds some pain? Perhaps put an Ackman wanna-be in his place?

**This stock has 60% of the shares float sold short.** 

The good news is, this closed above $33 yesterday, and with that 10% up move by the close, $TWLO has broken above the resistance, and now the short squeeze can begin. It could go anywhere from 10-40% in a day.

**The company posted sales of $49.9 million in 2013, followed by $88.8 million in 2014 and $166.9 million in 2015. (Guidance is on track for over $250 million for 2016.)**

Clearly this is a growth play, so down 58% since September is  an over-reaction. Q3 earnings slightly beat expectations, and despite some 5% bounces, shorts kept it down. 

Their governance is fairly impressive, even though I usually despise investing in any kind of company coming out of the Bay Area. With the Nasdaq reversing trend yesterday, it adds another reason to get on board now. The money flow is returning to tech.

**Yesterday's 10% move took out 9 days of sideways action. We have a pivot low in place at $30. The MACD is showing the black line just crossed over the red, which should signal a move up in price. I expect this to move very quickly, it is the nature of a short squeeze. My target is $48.**

16-11-16,5da6cf,Thoughts on OCUL? DD inside,"Ocular Therapeutix develops a sustained release platform for the delivery of eye medication. They are also currently seeking FDA approval for their anti-itch/anti-inflammatory medication to be used in conjunction with the platform for post-surgical patient eye care.

Patient compliance is horrendously bad for eye drops (for a number of reasons) and this would eliminate that problem completely. The space is conservatively estimated to be worth 2-3x OCUL's current market cap (150m). Many have it much higher than this.

Additionally, Regeneron, a pharmaceutical giant in the ophthalmology space, recently entered into a deal with Ocular Therapeutix for the use of their platform. Upon reaching certain milestones with the clinical testing of Regeneron's drug, Ocular Therapeutix may receive two payments of 150m (one for each milestone). This, in addition to the 10m up front payment, would total 310m in cash for Ocular Therapeutix as well as royalties on Regeneron's drug once it makes it to market.

The recent political climate has caused a shift in the economic sectors, with biotech being the largest benefactor. The Trump administration plans on reducing the stringency of the requirements to gain FDA approval, something this drug had already nearly achieved. There were manufacturing issues which were addressed and it is up for reapplication late this year.

16-11-16,5daafw,Craigslist ad for a band turns in to Stock Investment Guideline,"So, well over a year ago now, I had posted an ad to the Los Angeles Craigslist for music collaboration. This post brought in someone who had given me what seems to be pretty sound advice on investing in stocks. Back then though, I did not have near the money recommended by him for investing. Recently, I found out that I have 10k$ saved up in a company retirement fund that I hadn't realized I added to when I worked for them. That being said, I want to share this email with this bored and see what everyone's opinions are. I am not asking for advice, and if this is the wrong place to have said email decifered, please refer me to the correct place. I am new to reddit but felt the community would be quite helpful for this.

That being said, here is the copied text from the email:

""you are born in Clovis?? cool...Buddy was a great influence on a lot of bands, Beatles &amp; even Lemmy

investments, there are always good ones or better ones

go to Scottrade &amp; open an account, even when you are in cash they give you interest

https://www.scottrade.com/

suppose you have $10,000, that is $10K, K means thousand

the best interest you get in a bank here in 1.5% if you get a CD for a 5 year term

you know the official govt. inflation rate is 2% a year, &amp; actually that is understated, meaning really inflation is higher...you know what is inflation?? your money buys LESS than before because prices rise...so in those 5 years, your money has gained 1.5% interest, while it has devalued 10% or more...&amp; on the 1.5% they give you, you have to put it into your taxable income...do you know what that is called?? robbery...it's official theft by the federal govt....

so first off, pay off ALL your debts...being in debt makes you a slave...then save up $5K...that is a good way to start investing...

a safe investment is to buy a mutual fund, there are many, a fund is a group of stocks that some smart guy who is called a fund manager has put together...how do you pick a fund?? by it's performance...some people have a social conscience, they want to invest in something they believe in, &amp; not in some other thing they don't like...you know what I believe in &amp; I like?? what makes the best return...

&amp; it should be safe, Morning Star gives a rating on funds, 5 star means it's the safest &amp; least likely to drop like hell...if a fund did well over the last 5 years, that will probably continue...that is called momentum...

so go to a different broker, go to Fidelity Investments...they are good for mutual funds, they have some health science ones that are good...like FBIOX...see this...

https://www.fidelity.com/

go to investment products - mutual funds...Morning Star highly rated...

https://www.fidelity.com/fund-screener/evaluator.shtml#!&amp;ntf=Y&amp;expand=%24MorningstarRatings&amp;msr=4%2C5

at the top of the list is FBIOX, 12.9% return since Jan. 1st, 2015, not bad...click on it...

https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/316390772

see Hypothetical Growth, if you put $10K in FBIOX 10 years ago, today it's worth $56K, not bad...if you can find a better one, buy it...

the minimum to buy this fund is $2,500 &amp; there are no fees...Fidelity put the fund together, you could buy it thru another broker but then there is some cost...if you want to buy a Fidelity fund, you buy it from Fidelity...Scottrade is good for stock trading, their fees are lower...

suppose you get bored with a mutual fund (coz once you but it, ther ei nothign to do but watch it grow LOL)...you can buy a leveraged ETF...for example, you know the Standard &amp; Poor 500...S&amp;P500...it is 500 stocks that Mr. S &amp; Mr. P selected that demonstrate the health of the American economy...they go up &amp; down as a group, do you want to be diverse &amp; buy them all?? so one is down &amp; the other is up?? &amp; they are hitting record highs every week now?? sure, you can buy an ETF that is based on this index...there are TWO, both are leveraged...UPRO goes up 3% when S&amp;P goes up 1%...that's nice...3 x the gain...&amp; then there is SPXU, it is inverse ETF, it goes UP 3% when S&amp;P goes DOWN 1%...how do they do it?? I have no fucking idea...but I don't care...so when S&amp;P is rising, you buy UPRO, then when you think it has gone as high as it can, you sell it...then you buy SPXU &amp; when S&amp;P drops, you also gain...GREAT, like riding 2 elevators...but you have to buy enough
 of it to have a decent gain, because each trade costs you $7...so you have to gain more than that when you sell, of course...or you could very simple buy UPRO &amp; hold it...in the last year, S&amp;P is +12%, UPRO is +40%, go to Yahoo Finance &amp; see it for yourself...if you just did nothing more than buy UPRO &amp; hold it, you have a 40% gain...&amp; until you sell it, you have an Unrealized Gain, so no taxes...only when you SELL do you pay the taxes...the broker sends you a 1099 tax form, they report to IRS &amp; you put it into your 1040 following the instructions, very simple...

do you have $10K to invest?? put half in FBIOX &amp; the other half in UPRO...learn the market while you sit on the money &amp; make 40%...then start to trade between UPRO &amp; SPXU &amp; maybe you can double your money in a year...does this beat 1.5% return in 5 years?? fuck yeah...

I just gave you $1,000 dollars worth of free advice...

will the stock market ever crash?? of course it will...because the smart guys like to scare the suckers out, the weak people sell low, they are behind the curve...the smart people wait for the crash &amp; buy low, then they hold till the peak &amp; sell high...

will the stock market recover when it crashes...sure it always does, why?? because when the stocks are low, they are a bargain, the smart people buy it like on sale...&amp; lately, the US Govt. knows that the market is Too Big To Fail...did you know the US Govt. has spent about $40 BILLION of taxpayers dollars in the past year buying bonds to stabilize the market?? so YOUR tax money is holding up the market...if you are paying for something, should you not get a benefit?? if you don't then you are a dummy...

why does the govt. prop up the market?? because the average person sees the news, when he sees that the market is UP, he thinks the entire economy is good, so he votes for the incumbant politicians, &amp; those guys keep their jobs...when the economy sucks, people vote to kick out the incumbant politician, so that politician will use all his power to make things look good so he keeps his job...

&amp; also, when people are making profits in the stock market, they pay more taxes so the IRS gets more money in...

copy all this into a document &amp; save it...

&amp; get started...

you can trade on your computer from any place in the world that has internet access...so you could travel the world &amp; if you have enough investments, you can make money every day in the market &amp; fuck being some other person's bitch...

of course you will still be US Citizen, so you have to pay US taxes, but they are pretty low compared to most countries...until you get up to $300K a year income, then you might have some problems...

can you live fine on $200K a year?? I bet you can...don't be no sugardaddy to anybody either...you have to have the wisdom to handle the money &amp; not do stupid things...

&amp; don't tell anybody what you are doing...somebody ask you how is everything?? you say Not bad, could be better...&amp; you keep it on the downlow...fake friends will help you spend your money real fast...

what else you need to know??

I have around 2000 cash in my account. The min margin requirement is 50% for a trade, but all my cash is locked up in stocks right now. So before I would have had very little in buying power.

 My question is,

If the min requirement to make say a 500 dollar trade is 250 (50%), then do I need 250 cash in my account? Or does Robinhood use the 2000 in equity I currently have invested as the min margin requirement? 

So that would mean I could trade up to 4000 (2000 my cash which is currently invested and 2000 borrowed) and would that define min 50%. 

Thanks very much. I want to make sure I understand this correctly, before I get in trouble :)",0

Primarily, Wall Street is ready.  The hike is already 90% priced into the market anyway.  Not raising may even spur a bubble and cause next summer to rival the 2014 taper tantrum. 

Next, with oil rising and trump in office it's healthy to do a little inflation prevention.  

Also, with so much uncertainty about future relations with china and the Middle East (and even Mexico and Canada for that matter) it's a good idea for the Feds to give themselves so slack to play with in the event of a global shock.  

With that said, I don't think the market will dip as far as it did last year if they hike.  In fact, since Wall Street likes certainty so much we could see equity prices steadily rise through the hike.

It's an app that Uber's going after with Uber Eats? And still the business is doing good. :) But what about the stock?

* Allmenus.com and MenuPages.com provide an aggregated database of approximately 380,000 menus from restaurants.

So is it the Priceline of indie restaurants?

## Recent financials 

Now the sales are *small* but impressive growth all the same!

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $362m | $254m | $137m | $83m | $61m|
|EPS | $0.44 | $0.30 | $0.12 | $0.19 | $0.36|

and for 2016 the forecast is $494m of sales and EPS of $0.91

## Competition

The company itself says:

&gt; The Company primarily competes with the traditional offline ordering process used by the vast majority of restaurants and diners involving paper menus that restaurants distribute to diners, as well as advertising that restaurants place in local publications to attract diners. 

So it sees *paper menus* as the competitor. Though frankly, eat-in, using Uber Eats, going out to your favorite joint are all competitors. 

The result is it's hard to come up with a peer list. So how about tangentially looking at other booking platforms of the big eat-out brands?

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
GrubHub Inc | $456M | 25% | 5%
Sabre Corp | $3,302M | 28% | 39%
Tripadvisor Inc | $1,473M | 16% | 8%
Priceline Group Inc | $10,395M | 39% | 21%
Groupon Inc | $3,126M | 1% | -38%
Yelp Inc | $672M | 2% | -5%
McDonald's Corporation | $24,934M | 37% | 141%
Yum! Brands, Inc. | $12,894M | 22% | N/A
Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. | $3,867M | 7% | 4%

Margins aren't disappointing versus the booking-services. Though returns aren't great.

## Cash / Debt?

GrubHub Inc has $296M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 10% of the market value of GrubHub Inc. Probably not a bad idea to have some fire power in case there are bolton acquisitions to do.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $44.35 for GrubHub Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 22% to their target.

# Valuation

So on the face of it, the stock is wildly expensive! The long-term growth rates aren't any higher than the booking services, but maybe there is a perception that they've got a quasi-monopoly.

CMG | $11,990M | 263x | -6% | 0% | 2%

Perhaps it's to do with them being small too? i.e. lots of headroom, unlike the travel-giants.

# Dividends

GrubHub Inc is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. Though hardly a surprise.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -2% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 8%. That's against a backdrop of sales up 36% in the first 9 months and earnings up 60%.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers they raised guidance, spoke of the positive impacts of their rebranding, new initiatives etc. It was all cylinders-firing stuff. Of course the *competition* question arose. And here's the view from the CEO:

&gt; So there's a lot of people trying out a lot of different things, but I can say that we definitely believe that we have a significant structural advantage in that we are known for one thing only, and that's takeout ordering, and we back it up with world-class customer support. We believe this will succeed because of the singular focus on our ability to engineer our entire product and experience around this one purpose.

&gt; So industry-wide, we still have a huge advantage because we have the most comprehensive selection of restaurants and the lowest diner-facing fees. 

And alluding to Uber

&gt;  The requirements for food delivery are just more intense. It takes a lot more work to execute one of these transactions than it does to give someone a lift in a car. And so I think that in our world, automated delivery, specifically of food that is ordered and consumed within an hour, I think that automated delivery is just still science fiction.

Living in the UK, I don't use the product, so can't tell if it is truly a great product, but the signs are clearly there! 

But 40x this year's earnings for a small cap stock is a bit racy for me. And if I look to 2017, where sales are forecast to grow 25% to over $600m and earnings to hit $1.15, I'm then paying 32x earnings. For now I'm going to watch, if the business keeps delivering but investors lose interest... then perhaps it'll be worth a second look.

They reveal their Q3 tomorrow, and they moved it up like 10 days to be there. You only do that when you are trying to rally money up and have had one good quarter out of a bunch of bad ones. They plan on selling assets in Q4 so that will obviously be a net loss, however with the increasing BDI, I bet It'll be worth $40+ tomorrow morning.

The Best REIT You Don't Own: National Storage Affiliates
Nov. 16, 2016 11:55 AM • NSA


Summary
Storage REITs (PSA, EXR, CUBE, LSI) performed very well until mid-2016.

National Storage Affiliates has outperformed peers by executing on a differentiated acquisition strategy.

3Q 2016 results from the major storage REITs demonstrate NSA’s ability to grow revenue and FFO at a faster rate than peers.

The biggest risk to NSA and its peers is added supply. Lenders such as Jernigan Capital are helping developers to build new facilities in certain markets.

NSA is the newest storage REIT and its balance sheet is not as strong as peers'. However, NSA recently raised its dividend from $0.22 to $0.24 per share.

 said Trump when asked how he planned to reform the country’s prison system.


OK so what about CXW specifically makes it a winner? Fear not my loveable band of autists. Off top they have a healthy P/E ratio of 11.4, they have a dividend yield above 10%, and robust EPS of $1.81.

To be completely honest with you guys... we kind of missed the bus. This bad boy closed at $14.19 a share before the election. It's trading at just over $20 now.

16-11-17,5dcslg,Ustocktrade is no longer a viable pleb day trader platform,"Got this email today: 


Thank you for being a valued Ustocktrade customer. Please read the important notfication below: 

A recent regulatory examination of trading activity has uncovered certain trading activity that may be “free riding”, in violation of federal regulations (Federal Reserve Regulation T).  To address these regulatory concerns, we are taking the following measures so you can continue to enjoy Ustocktrade with fewer trading interruptions.

Ustocktrade will continue to offer same-day settlement (T+0) for certain User-to-User trades within the network giving immediate access to settled sales proceeds or securities. However, this is projected to be a small percentage of current Ustocktrade activity.

Be advised that in instances where the contra party to a User trade is the Super User, the trade will be settled in the normal 3 business day settlement cycle (T+3). The Super User is a liquidity provider within the Alternative Trading System (ATS). In the event, there is no User to take the other side of an order, the Super User may step in to complete the trade at the NBBO price or better.

We will be implementing system changes effective on November 28th to subject certain trades within the network to the normal 3 day (T+3) settlement. This will be done by segregating in the User’s account the settled cash and securities (which can be used immediately) from the unsettled cash and securities (which will not become available until fully settled on the 4th business day (T+4)). In restricting the use of unsettled funds, Ustocktrade will effectively protect users from “free riding” violations under Regulation T.
 
In the interim, until we have completed these system changes, we will be monitoring trading activity for trades that could constitute a “free ride” which will result in your account being placed on a 90-day restriction. Such a restriction would limit you to only sell settled stock that you own or to buy stock with settled funds. Alternatively, a User can deposit additional funds to make additional purchases.

We at Ustocktrade are committed to exploring all appropriate ways to maximize the availability of T+0 settlement for our Users.

I have read your guys’ wiki and the popular “intro posts.”  I still am looking for some more personal advice that is more specific to my situation.  Your “new here, read this first” post says to give as much info as you can if you still have questions.  Below is as much info as I can give:

I am in the military and in my mid-20s.  I have no girlfriend, no wife, no children.  I have no debt and will not be paying any bills for roughly the next 12 months, all while maintaining a steady income.  This is mainly because I will be getting deployed for a while and have moved all my possessions into a family member’s storage unit.  

I already have a roth retirement account set up, and a separate savings account on the side.  I am not worried about savings.  

**I have set aside ~$30,000 to play with (and could do more depending on if I get the hang of things) in which I would like to turn into the most money that I can within a year (end of 2017).**  

I have absolutely zero risk aversion and am looking to get into whatever I can.  I have set this money aside specifically for this, and have other money set aside in savings.  I really would like to do the most I can primarily to make money (obviously), but also I am really just interested in how the whole system works and I feel that the only way to understand it is to actually get involved with it.  

For the last 1-2 years I have been playing around with some money without really knowing what I have been doing.  I opened up a Fidelity account about a year ago and have been using that.  It’s not too much, and honestly I don’t even know if I have made or lost money (I think I have lost a bit).  

What I currently do is basically google a company or industry that I am thinking about for some reason, look at the first page of google to see if it may do well, and I buy the stock and hope for the best.  I haven’t really learned much in my endeavors, but granted this maybe from a lack of effort on my part.

Below I answer the specific questions from the “new here” post.

Some questions that should be considered are: 

&gt;*how old are you?* 

**mid-20s**

&gt;*what is your income?*  

**~$60,000/yr**

&gt;*are you in debt?* 

**None**
 
&gt;*what is your risk tolerance?* 

**No risk aversion at all.  Like I stated above, the money I will be using is set aside for this; I honestly don’t mind losing it all, I am more interested in learning how this all works and figure the best way to do it is to make money as I do it.**

&gt;*how many years of experience (or not) do you have?* 

**~1-2 years, but it’s a stretch to say I’ve really learned much**

&gt;*how much capital will you be starting with?*  

**~$30,000**

&gt;*do you have money in savings?* 

**Yes** 

&gt;*what topics have you read about and what do you still not understand?*  

**I suppose I am mostly asking for help with the overall scheme of things.  How do people know the right stocks to invest in?  At this point I pretty much google random companies or industries that I think about and see if they are good to invest in via the first page of google results.  If it’s a cheap enough stock, I buy it and hope for the best.  I feel as though I don’t understand the system as a whole which maybe holding me back.  Or perhaps I’m just overanalyzing. Idk.  Where do I go to get the juicy info?  How come I am not a millionaire?** (I hope I don't need an /s).

&gt;*are there any companies in particular you wish to invest in?* 
 
**Idk, I suppose that's one of my main questions.  *Should* there be ones I particularly wish to invest in?  I am particularly interested in the ones that will make me money as opposed to not make me money.....**

&gt;*what kind of learning material are you interested in?*  

**Any**

&gt;*are you trying to generate an income from the market or just plan for retirement?*  

**Income, I have a separate plan/setup for retirement.  I want to make the most money that I can in the next year.**

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

**TL;DR:
Young, have some money to play with.  No risk aversion.  Been playing around for about a year and not learning from experience much.  Looking to see how I can turn my money into the most possible within one year (or at least have learning the system).**

16-11-17,5dcvpl,Here are my 2 favorite high risk high reward sectors. What are yours?,"Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin specifically) and cannabis. 

Bitcoin is more of a long term bet in my book. Networks take time to build out and new systems of value take time to establish confidence. Currently there are lots of exciting developments in the crypto space, paired with global economic uncertainty I would posit that the future is bright for these new forms of finite digital value. 

Cannabis is a trend that also seems set for explosive growth over the next few years. Canada could well legalize in the next two years and already has several grow ops that have established roots. Aphria is one of the main picks I have been seeing top the charts lately. 

Bonus: autonomous rides sharing could be YUGE. Keeping an eye on that sector and will jump at Uber if/when it goes public. 

Disclaimer: I'm no professional, but I can say with honesty that my intuitions over the last 5 years have been more right than wrong on many accounts. I'll never forget watching the documentary ""the death of the electric car"" and thinking how badly I wanted to buy tesla stock. Alas I was a poor college student and didn't act.

Relative value trade on XLF/SPY. XLF, the financial sector EFT, typically has a very high ~90% correlation with the SP500. Normal pair value is between -15 to -25. Financials have completely decoupled from the SP500 by a 5 standard deviation spike and now sits 4 deviations away from the average. The five sigma move is a 0.00006% chance move. Have entered into a short on the pair and expect to exit by year end when it returns to a normal range pictured below.

http://imgur.com/a/2iN0H

Risks: This is most certainly a 'trump effect' on financials. It is possible that this could be a permanent regime shift in the pair relationship rather than a temporary one. However in this case, I expect little down side if it is permanent and would put the risk/reward at 5/15.

Trump wants to build walls and prevent immigrants from taking US jobs, &amp; H1B Visas help Silicon Valley a lot. Basically, the dust has settled and now is a perfect buying opportunity for these stocks.

Trump has been said to ""flip flop"" on the question, but in my opinion he has only tried to avoid a direct answer. He has been for it and he has been against it. He is ""all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley"" and has said, ""We need highly skilled people in this country, and if we can’t do it, we’ll get them in.""

But, in opposition, Trump has said, ""I know the H-1B. I know the H2B. Nobody knows it better than me. I’m a businessman. These are laws. These are regulations. These are rules. We’re allowed to do it. … I will take advantage of it; they’re the laws. But I’m the one that knows how to change it. Nobody else on this dais knows how to change it like I do, believe me."" 

But the real downfall for Tech was this statement, ""I know the H-1B very well. And it’s something that I, frankly, use, and I shouldn’t be allowed to use it. We shouldn’t have it. Very, very bad for workers. And second of all, I think it’s very important to say, well, I’m a businessman and I have to do what I have to do. When it’s sitting there waiting for you, but it’s very bad. It’s very bad for business in terms of — and it’s very bad for our workers and it’s unfair for our workers. And we should end it.”

H1B Visas refer to workers in specialty occupations requiring at least a Bachelor's Degree. H2B Visas refer to, basically, all other immigrant workers when there aren't enough U.S. workers able or willing to do the job.

Trump builds houses and bars and real estate. Trump probably hires a lot of construction workers. Trump knows the H2B. Trump is not going to screw over Silicon valley by ending H1B Visas. Maybe reform is in order to keep US jobs from going overseas, but Trump isn't going to destroy an entire sector over this.

16-11-17,5ddqkx,"Question I Cannot Find The Answer To: Investing in ""emerging markets"" index funds","I've been searching for an answer to this question and I cannot seem to find an answer. It might be better to ask a Norwegian person directly, but unfortunately I do not know any. Therefore I direct this question to this community:

Say you are living in Norway, and you invest in the Norwegian stock market through a passively tracked index fund similar to our S&amp;P 500 funds or Total Stock Market funds. What company do you use to purchase these funds? Certainly not Vanguard or Fidelity. What companies do the majority of Norwegians use to purchase these index funds? 

The reason I am asking is because from a US-based investor's perspective, it seems one of the only index funds available to invest in that covers the Norwegian market is the ETF ENOR. However this fund only has $30M AUM, which obviously doesn't capture even close to the entire Norwegian Market.

What I suspect is that there are passive Norwegian allocated index mutual funds offered by Norwegian companies marketed towards Norwegian citizens that have very high AUM and very low annual expense ratios. I would like to find these companies and invest in these funds rather than invest in ENOR. 

""Norway"" here can be substituted for any country that doesn't have significant coverage from a US/English perspective.

Russia is among the most undervalued markets in the world, however this has started to turn over from 2016. And since Trump is very Russia-friendly, we could expect Russian stocks to gain A LOT.

I just bought RSX ETF and the Mechel Oao Ads (MTL) ADR.

If you look at both technical charts, they look very bullish indeed. 

Again, I could be wrong, but I think the US stock market is due for a correction very soon (either this or next week).

As Jim Rogers always says ""why buy the US at all-time highs when you have bargains elsewhere?""

Jim Rogers profited A LOT in Japan just when Japan started their QE policies. The Nikkei boomed from the 8500 level in 2012 to the 20,000 of August 2015. It was an easy way to get a &gt;100% return in less than 3 years.

2. I can short selling and trade on margin.
3. I can potentially open more than one accounts.

The goal is to maximize the Shape ratio: http://www.stocktrak.com/pdf/ST_Sharpe_Ratio_3perc.pdf. The top 3 (out of around 80 students) would be the winners, so maybe I shouldn't use some strategy that is hyper risky.

This is my first class in finance and I have no prior knowledge about trading. Let me know if you need more information. I did some Google search and found https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/16w9h3/just_started_the_stock_trak_program_in_my/ and http://education.howthemarketworks.com/news/easiest-way-to-win-a-virtual-trading-game/ helpful. But it seems that their goal is to maximize the return instead of the Shape ratio. And therefore the suggested strategy is to invest in hyper risky securities like 3xETF and futures.

So most people currently know that NVDA has been doing great. I bought 15 shares @68.92 and recently sold @87.99.

Am I mixing up the limit price type with some similar term?

I'm upset because now NVDA is @94.03 and I only set the limit to be safe. I feel stupid for only learning about stocks through trial and error. Its working out and I'm happy I've actually made money since I started a year ago, but things like this shouldn't be happening after a year of investing.

(NASDAQ:DCIX), (the ""Company""), a global shipping company specializing in the ownership of containerships, today reported a net loss of $126.8 million for the third quarter of 2016, compared to a net loss of $9.1 million for the respective period of 2015. The loss for the third quarter of 2016 was mainly the result of $118.9 million of impairment charges for seven of the Company's vessels, without which the result for the quarter would have been a net loss of $7.9 million.

Time charter revenues, net of prepaid charter revenue amortization, were $8.0 million for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $16.1 million for the same period of 2015, mainly due to reduced employment opportunities and time charter rates.

Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $140.6 million, compared to a net loss of $8.7 million for the same period of 2015. The loss for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, was mainly the result of $118.9 million of impairment charges for seven of the Company's vessels, without which the result for the period would have been a net loss of $21.7 million. Time charter revenues, net of prepaid charter revenue amortization, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, amounted to $27.7 million, compared to $47.3 million for the same period of 2015.

16-11-17,5di4vk,"Stocktwits &amp; WSB merger (Quality DD)","The deal has been struck on November 17th between WSB and Stocktwits. Merger deal seems to be resulted in partial acquisition of WSB by Stocktwits, as we can see from the recent hike in StockShitpostTwits in WSB. Deregulation of the WSB by removing Automod seems to be the catalyst of the acquisition. It rose questions for efficiency, about shareholder voting for regulatory aspects of WSB. While the uncertainty lasts, we are bullish on WSB and the long term play is still intact. 

UBZ Analyst Shitpost Dickhead said: ""The merger wasnt a surprise after the deregulation, we were expecting an increase in shitposts anyway. What surprised our research team the most is every 1.5 posts out of 2 became about stocktwits, which is %30 more than our estimations.""

Goldman Snacks warned investors about the recent plummet of quality posts. The elite investment bank said a spike in autism is to be expected. Quality posts is expected to decrease around 16% in the next quarter, however a rebound is still expected. Recent Shipping post rally in WSB is a proof that WSB still keeps its core autism intact.


WSB currently have 5 buy 10 hold 2 sell ratings.

UBS offers something like this, homing assets in Switzerland, but they charge 1.1-1.3% annually to do it, because it seems to be inseparable from their private wealth management. You get full management, tax forms, etc, but on a minimum ~$1M investment, I have a hard time getting over the idea of paying them $1k/mo for what's likely to be mostly a buy-and-hold approach, with quarterly rebalancing. They claim to offer the ability to buy equities directly in markets worldwide, but I'm not sure how that access compares to what I already get in Vanguard's Total International and Emerging Markets funds. And I don't know if their active management is worth a damn (A Random Walk and other literature seem to be pretty conclusive in saying that it's probably not).

Anyway, does anyone know of a good place to read client reviews of private wealth managers? And does anyone know anything about these international PWM offerings by foreign banks? Is there a cheaper way to have an investment account outside of the US?",1

16-11-17,5diptc,Here is something you guys should learn from the shipping mania,"Besides the obvious shit like fucking take profits when your already up over 100% and other shit that everybody should know I want to add what nobody has mentioned.

When the shares of a company goes up, investors make money especially the insiders if they sell but not the company. But how will shares and insider options matter if the company can go bankrupt at any time. Long story short if a company especially a low cap company or a company in extreme debt (99% of greece shippers) a large run up in share price can incentive the executives to take advantage of the situation. They'll offer a public offering or activate already predetermined warrants to make money to stay afloat . Usually these shares are significantly below the overinflated trading price. This will dilute shares and 99% of the time the stock crashes as it offerings say a lot about a business. One is that they're desperate for cash. Which is obviously not good

This happened famously with debt riddled AMD but they have since recovered. It seems like the next meme sector is energy. Well LEI was up 80% yesterday. Executives announced a public offering AH and the stock tanked 40%. Today I called that DRYS which is millions in debt will do a offering in less than 48hrs. They announced it 2 hours later and even with this info people here were asking if it'll rocket or not. Long story short learn to not be greedy. The only people who lost on shipping are greedy retards. Its better to pick a stock and be wrong than to pick a stock be right and still lose money.

These are not long-term investments. Unfortunately, even cashing out won't help me if the USD devalues significantly.

What's the best way to do this through my Vanguard account?

Regarding currency, it seems that I want ""unhedged"" index funds and ETFs, since I'm expecting non-USD-backed currencies to become more valuable. Is that correct? In that case, which (promising) economies and currencies are most divorced from USD? My impression, Vanguard-wise, is that the Pacific Stock Index Fund might be the best bet here, but I'm not sure. (iShares seem to have country-specific funds, but that might be too fine-grained for me.)

As for betting against market growth, is there any way to execute this bet with index or mutual funds — that is, without having to buy individual stocks?

Regardless of whether or not you agree with my predictions, thank you!",2

My roommate left me a copy of Ben Graham's The intelligent investor, and as I begin to read it, it has become obvious very quickly that I first need to learn about the definitions of everything he is talking about, i.e. I am not yet ready to start reading it yet.

She is budget conscious but hasn't the first clue about investing. She is in college and paying some of her own bills, but currently draws about 500/mo on the cash balance from the inheritance. 

What is my goal to help her? To put the money to work and provide her a modest monthly income while she finishes school. I personally have rental real estate which she could ""invest in"" but I don't really want to tie up her capital in the event she does want to self manage. 

My initial 50,000 ft view to create some monthly income for her would be as such:

* 100k in some monthly or quarterly payout REIT funds
* 150k in blue chip dividend paying stocks
* 50k in ""micro loan"" capital where she could get her toes wet and learn about the principles of investing and choose from a variety of projects to support. 

What do you guys think about a plan to provide her a monthly income? I know a lot of people would say throw it in an index fund and forget about it, but I think the ""passive"" income part of it is somewhat important for her plans.",5

I strongly believe that if this device can be developed and brought to market it is worth millions (based on market research and my experience working with the target demographic).

Obviously this is high risk, I wouldn't invest anything I'm not prepared to lose, and the majority of my money is spread in more normal investments.  The basics of the deal would be: I give a certain amount of money, to own a percentage of the patents themselves (along with the business they belong to).

Being so I've already purchased a few books such as the ""Intelligent Investor and ""Investing for Dummies."" I also have been using Investopedia using the simulator and reading the articles. I am a decent student in school but my math grade is not my strong point. I would like to consider going into economics for college but worrying if my math skills will hurt me. I have such a great interest for economics. My school was not offered calculus or statistics at my grade yet so I will be going into senior year will no skills in those subjects. Would it be a long shot for me to major in economics?

TL;DR: Strategy is: 

-40% in S&amp;P 500 ETF (like VOO) (I'm considering SPYX)

-25% Vanguard intermediate term corporate bonds (VCIT) (I think its too much for something with such low returns, might distribute 20% from here to assets listed below, put more in bonds as I near retirement age)

-15% in Developed Market ETF (like VEA)

-10% in Developing Market ETF (like VWO)

Obviously in response to the election someone evaluated that sector as a good target, but how then does it turn into what was essentially penny stock pumping/dumping? Is it as simple as a lot of day traders recognizing an uptick in a super cheap stock so they go running, which leads to more attention, which leads to chatter, which leads to everyone and their mom jumping in? Or was there some tell tale analytic that a shit ton of people all noticed, ad they jumped on it? or, what?",58
16-11-19,5dpwlr,DWTI AND UWTI idea.,"So somebody shoot down this idea why it wouldn't work.  Before the delisting short both UWTI and DWTI.  Regardless of the direction of oil you stay at around zero p/l (minus contango I guess). When the delisting occurs I assume there will be a huge sell off of people trying to get rid of it and I also assume it will eventually go to near zero since there is no reason to buy it and people will be selling their asses off trying to get out of it.

16-11-18,5dksi5,"My father passed away earlier this Summer unexpectedly; my mother (and I) just inherited his IRA.... I honestly have no idea what to do from here, any help from fellow Redditors?","Hi Reddit,

I am turning to Reddit in hopes that someone out here may be able to help me. I hope I am posting in the right place... If I am not, please kindly let me know and direct me to which subreddit I should post in. 

I graduated from college 2 years ago, but I personally do not have any knowledge on stocks/investments nor have any I ever taken any college courses on it so, I am pretty clueless....

My father passed away at the end of June 2016 and it was very unexpected... I do not know much about my father's previous job since he was laid off when I was very young (maybe when I was in elementary). During his time, he did not really share much information about this so this all recently came to light.

Continuing, I had found out my father had  a IRA with his previous employer (which was a stock company). We had finished the paperwork to have his account transferred to under my mother's name, as the beneficiary. 

My mother does not speak English very well and does not know much about my father's IRA either... Since his passing, it's been very difficult to put the pieces to the puzzle together; he did not leave a will behind either.

The only information I know is that he invested his IRA in Sprint and currently has over 12,000 shares. The account value is currently at $95,000 or so... 

Here's the link of a screenshot: http://imgur.com/HcHz7kS

My mother had chose to take the 5 Year Path for she does not want to continue investing, but would like to take the money out to put away in our savings... Easier said than done though especially when I am so clueless about stocks!! :/

I understand that account value is different from account balance. My question is.... What do I do now? I want to help my mother out, but I do not know any information about stocks other than simply googling. 

I do not feel comfortable talking to my father's company for questions so I am hoping I can reach out to someone on Reddit who could help out.

If there's any further questions about this, please ask! I can clarify as I hope to find answers soon. Since he had passed so suddenly..... It's been very stressful dealing with his death and I just want to ensure my mother is taken care of. I have no other family I can turn to for advice. 

Thanks in advance, Reddit.",20

SWHC is expected to post 55c/share earnings, over twice the previous year's earnings for the same time period. The only thing that  I've come across that suggests it might go down is that people think that since there's no immediate threat of new gun control legistlation that people won't be panic buying guns, and that their rebranding efforts might hurt their profits some at first if they market their non-gun related products under a new name.

16-11-19,5dq75l,Wash Sale implications,"So I've always put my money in Vanguard, contribute on a monthly basis etc. I started trying out those new roboinvestors, specifically wealthfront, two months ago, and put Tax Loss Harvesting on without thinking twice...
Both these accounts are individual taxable brokerage accounts. 

Relevant transaction history: 
*9/12/2016: Wealthfront bought VTI 2 shares $219.56
*10/21/2016: Vanguard bought VTSAX $250.
*11/2/2016: Wealthfront did a TLH and sold 2 shares of VTI for $215.68 for a tax harvested loss of $3.88. 

Given VTI and VTSAX are ""substantially identical"", I probably triggered a wash sale from the 10/21 purchase and the 11/2 TLH sale. 
I reviewed the other TLH and immediately turned it off. Do not think I triggered any other wash sales other than the small one above. 
First time this has ever happened to me ever, tried researching for answers on how this affects me when filing my taxes but did not find any substantial answers, specifically since I only sustained a $3.88 TLH...

Do I just tag on the $3.88 to the $250 on VTSAX? And keep this piece of information stored somewhere until I actually sell $250 worth of VTSAX, and thus tag it in during that tax year? Even if I don't plan on selling anytime soon?

Probably will cross post to r/tax unless someone has any other insightful ideas.  ",1

Not for me (perhaps at some point, but not today), but I'm sure some here are going to be interested given the subject matter.

I will say, this actually has real names among management - ""Before Innovative Industrial, Gold co-founded San Diego’s BioMed Realty, a publicly traded REIT that owned dozens of biotechnology buildings across the country. Before that, Gold was a top executive at publicly traded Alexandria Real Estate Equities, which specialized in office properties.

BioMed was acquired by private equity firm Blackstone Group early this year for $4.9 billion. 

Innovative Industrial has five workers. Others on the management team are from Iso Nano International, Realty Income, CoreSite Realty Corp and Real Estate Management Services.""

_____

""**Innovative Industrial doesn’t own any buildings yet**. It has non-binding letters of intent to buy two properties – one in New York and another in Illinois -- for $36 million. It expects to qualify to become a Real Estate Investment Trust.

REITs commonly specialize in specific property types – such as office buildings or strip malls. But Innovative Industrial is going after an unusual niche.

The company believes state-licensed medical cannabis growers sometimes struggle to get bank loans or other traditional financing for their businesses – in part because marijuana remains illegal under federal law.

One way they can free up capital is by selling indoor grow facilities to Innovative Industrial and then leasing the buildings back, according to the prospectus.""",21

2) Gold, and miners to a lesser extent, are falling off a cliff due to the impending rate hike and perceived strength of dollar.
3) The rate hike percentage is about ~90%.

Admittedly, I am not the most experienced investor and trader, having only been active for the last few years, but in my experience rate hikes have caused the VIX to spike dramatically because of how they effect the market.

This time last year, the Fed hiked rates a quarter of basis point in December, and with the turmoil in China's yaun devaluation, caused massive market instability and selloff.

If the Feds hike rates next month, shouldn't VIX rise considerably (since stronger dollar would imply less stock/$ value)?

[Moreover, the yaun is at an eight year low as reported two days ago.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-16/china-s-yuan-tumbles-to-eight-year-low-as-banks-weaken-forecasts#media-1) If the US hikes rates it will make the dollar stronger and consequently further damage the yaun.

My experience suggests that the Chinese will try to modify their monetary policy and value to compensate the hike, as the capital 'flood' away from China and into US investments has been ongoing.

In short, if rates hike, the VIX should pop, especially with the current condition of China (not to mention Brexit/Euro issues). We should see a minor sell-off. If China pulls the trigger before raise rates then, like Brexit or China last year, Yellen would likely sit on the sidelines.

What am I missing? Can rates be raised in the current global environment without the VIX going crazy?

Edit: If China devalues before rate hike, gold skyrockets. I feel like gold miners and VIX is 'the play'. Oil also factors. If we hike and oil drops vs. the dollar, do we also see a market that follows oil into the depths of sub $40/b?

Do this 10-20 times and I'll have a nice 10% return (yes, I'm assuming risk of losses). However, does this make logical sense to do assuming I want to take on the risk? I would just pay capital gains at the end of the year in a lump sum right? Say it took 20 trades to get +$100.

16-11-19,5droi8,Question re preference of selling position before distribution or post-distribution to minimize taxable event.,"I looked for the daily question thread as per the sidebar, but did not find one. Hopefully this assists some others as well. 

My question deals with the following assumptions:

1. Fund: [JANDX](http://beta.morningstar.com/funds/XNAS/JANDX/quote.html)
2. Account: non-retirement brokerage (non-tax advantaged)
3. Distribution date: 12/17/16
4. Funds have been held for over 1 year, except for DRIP, if applicable. 

Historically, JANDX has paid out on or around each December 17th as some form of long and short term distribution/dividend income. This creates a taxable event. 

From what I understand, funds will make these distributions, causing their NAV to drop an equivalent amount to the distribution. However, the shareholder now has to deal with the taxable event, even if they do not sell the shares.

I am thinking of redeeming JANDX to Fidelity and will purchase their equivalent fund at a significantly lower ER (.77 to .0x). 

However, to maximize the value to the shareholder, without incurring any tax liabilities, does it make sense to sell/redeem the entirety of JANDX prior to the distribution date? ",1

  I have my whole portfolio in optionshouse.  Its split between an IRA and a normal single person account.

Is the merger going to go through? 8k was filed in may 2016, still no news. Also mention of a 1 to 100 reverse stock split.
From my conservative and humble mindset I see this going two ways, this is bullshit and won't happen and spcl stock alone is worthless. Or the merger happens and rs and you have a chance at doubling or more your money pending on attention the stock receives, pixelmags seems to have good profit from what I can find and could possibly turn out to be a good company.

if you happen to buy high and sell low, then buy low and sell high.. if your net is positive you pay taxes on it,  and dont if you're negative

# Description

The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company is engaged in developing, manufacturing, marketing and distributing tires for various applications. It also manufactures and markets rubber-related chemicals for various applications. 

About 87% of the business is new tires and they divide the world into 4 regions: North America; EMEA; Asia-Pac and Latam. 

## Recent financials 

2015 wasn't a good year for GT :)

&gt; Net sales decreased in 2015 due to unfavorable foreign currency translation, primarily in EMEA, and lower sales in other tire-related businesses, primarily third-party chemical sales in North America. These declines were partially offset by higher tire unit volume, primarily in Asia Pacific.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $16.4bn | $18.1bn | $19.5bn | $21.0bn | $11.8bn|
|EPS | $1.12 | $8.78 | $2.28 | $0.74 | $1.26|
|DPS | $0.25 | $0.22 | $0.05 | N/A | N/A|

It hurt profits too. 

And if we look at 2016 the forecast is for $15.3bn of sales though EPS should recover substantially to $3.95.

&gt; Net sales decreased in the first nine months of 2016, due primarily to lower sales of $364 million due to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary, unfavorable foreign currency translation of $240 million, primarily in Americas and EMEA, lower sales of $197 million in other tire-related businesses, primarily related to motorcycle tire sales in Americas due to the dissolution of the global alliance with SRI, and a decline in price and product mix of $153 million, primarily in EMEA and Asia Pacific, driven by the impact of lower raw material costs on pricing. 

So was 2016 the last of it? Perhaps. Wall Streets forecasting growth at the top and bottom lines in 2017.

## Competition

Here's how they see their competition:

&gt;  On a worldwide basis, we have two major competitors, Bridgestone (based in Japan) and Michelin (based in France), that have large shares of the markets of the countries in which they are based and are aggressively seeking to maintain or improve their worldwide market share. Other significant competitors include Continental, Cooper, Hankook, Kumho, Pirelli, SRI, Toyo, Yokohama and various regional tire manufacturers. 

Bottom of the class on margins and returns. :( though perhaps that is a sign of potential! Or is it poor management.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co | $15,480M | 14% | 7%
Bridgestone Corp (ADR) | $31,048M | 19% | 13%
Cie Gnrl des Etblsmnts Michelin SCA | €21,199M | 18% | 12%
Continental AG (ADR) | $41,983M | 16% | 23%
Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Co | $2,917M | 17% | 24%

## Cash / Debt?

Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co has $5,053M of net debt. That is 2.3x it's latest operating profit. Not uncomfortably high, but means there's hardly room for extra-ordinary share buybacks.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $33.67 for Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 10% to their target.

# Valuation

When you look at the global players, it not hard to see why there could be upside. Even a jump to little Cooper's valuation would help. Cashflow generation seems strong across the sector. So I have to admit to being intrigued by this one!

CTB | $2,053M | 9x | N/A | 1% | 18%

# Dividends

Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.30 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $0.25 per share. The forecast dividend of $0.30 compares to a forecast EPS of $3.95.

And management does have authority to buy back stock.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 5% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -3%. On a 6 month view the stock is up 10% despite flat earnings forecasts. In fact the valuation has fluctuated from 11x at the star of the year to as low as 6x in the middle of the year.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, they reiterated their goal of $3bn of operating profit in 2020. Though it's hard to see any of the commentary or questioning give confidence they can get there.

Seems they are fighting against bad product mix, a strong dollar, weakness in Europe, legacy factories, etc etc etc etc etc. 

But at 7x forecast earnings, and those earnings looking like they are stabilizing... is the price alright?

16-11-18,5dozc8,"I've just started trading on a boolean market and have come up with my list of rules. Care to offer any critique and add some that I've missed?","***The Absolute Boolean Trading Rules as Defined by Me***

**1.** No trading before 7:30am or until after you have been awake and showered for 30 minutes. You're not alert enough to make sensible moves.

**2.** No trading after 5:30pm. You need to know when to call it a day and switch off from it so you can be on the ball for the next days trading.

**3.** Only trade Monday to Friday during working days. Weekends and holidays are just that. A tired brain is one that makes mistakes.

**4.** No drinking and trading. Hit the days target before any alcohol. Once you've had a drink, stop trading. Alcohol + trading = bad risk judgement.

**5.** The daily target is a 50% increase on the opening stake. The stretch target is a 100% increase on the opening stake. If you hit the daily and start slipping when trying to reach the stretch then stop trading. Some profit is better than no profit.

**6.** Don't chase a loss! If your trades are tanking, cap your trading at 50% loss of stake and call it a day. It's better to come back fresh tomorrow rather than compound a string of bad judgements.

**7.** Do not have more than two open positions at one time. Sometimes the market moves in crazy ways that are counter to our intuition. If you have more than two positions open you risk a rapid loss stream before being able to notice the unusual market actions.

**8.** Do not trade OTC positions, only trade on live open markets. OTC positions on Boolean Exchanges do not react the same way as a live open market and all usual logic is null and void.

**9.** Do not place turbo trades. This is a fast way to lose money. Try to place a 15 minute trade that's 20 minutes out.

**10.** If given the option to cancel your trade whilst making 50% or more of the predicted profit then take it. A guaranteed profit is better than a potential one.",0

Don't be bagholders for shit stock. Instead, realize that...

&gt; If to these actual losses are added the profits that might have been made through the proper reinvestment of these funds if such reinvestment had been made when the mistake was first realized, the cost of self-indulgence becomes truly tremendous.

As of late, the stock has dropped to around $4 which is a 52 week low. This is mostly secondary to their reporting expected in their networks business in 2017 due to contraction of the market.

However, there are some bright spots on the horizon. They plan to re-enter the smart phone market in 2017 with 2 devices. Although as well all know, competition in that market is ridiculous.

He's made his fair share of bad bets over the past two years (bagholding VRX, shorting HLF), but what do you guys think about his most recent bet on Chipotle?

Personally, I would never invest in restaurant stocks. What could be popular today could be less popular tomorrow. I personally dine at Chipotle three or four times a year, but in my city, lots of imitation burrito joints have cropped up with better selections, so some more of my dining dollars go there instead. 

I note that Chipotles in my city aren't as busy as they once were several years back. They are still making pretty decent business, but the brand has definitely suffered in the wake of their E.coli crisis not too long ago. 

Still, Mr. Ackman is one of the better hedge fund managers when you consider his record as a whole. He's made a lot of good calls. I think his problem is that he didn't diversify enough - his portfolio is very concentrated in fewer than 10 different companies. ",5

Tesla could always change its plans. None of these projects necessarily have to happen, and Tesla has changed its outlook on capital spending and funding needs on multiple occasions this year. But shareholders enjoy its lofty valuation based on what Tesla could become, rather than what the business does today. That would likely change if Tesla became less ambitious.

&gt; [The company’s serial equity issuance and stock option granting has pushed diluted shares outstanding above 157 million, up from 92 million in 2010, according to FactSet. Look for that number to increase further in the new year.](http://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-investors-still-need-to-watch-their-wallets-1479493840)

I have a little over $10,000 in the bank with my wife who is a patient scheduler at a heart center. In addition I have almost $10,000 in my 401k and last week invested $1k in the Stock Market. 

Due to the overtime threshold law being passed and going into effect my company elected to raise our salaries in order to be compliant with the law. They raised our salaries from $30,000 to $43,000. We also make commission on top of our salary, and next year I should make anywhere from $80-$100k. With a baby on the way I would like my wife to have the option to stay at home.

Eventually the decision was made to make acquisitions and form a broader based business.  I was hired by the PE company to work within this company and form the operation we had talked about as the acquired businesses did not have it.

My question is this.  I am running into resistance from people above me about this operation.  A lot of this is due to the fact that they have no experience with my operation.  Some of the original members of the acquired companies are even actively trying to keep the PE company out of the loop.   I am not sure how to approach this.  I don't want to piss off the officers and VP's that are engaging in this but they are actively hindering the operation I was hired to start.  

I do not have an officer title and am the only person that was brought in separately from any of the acquisitions.  I do have Class C and Class D shares in this company as a whole.  For this reason it is extremely important to me that this business is successful.  Any ideas on how to approach this situation?",1

We (wife, 2 kids) own our own house and have a modest income from our small business (approx 35k). I'm interested in taking out a mortgage on the house with plans to re-invest the cash in assets susceptible to inflation. I suspect the presidents policies will cause both inflation and therefore interest rates to rise in response.

I can get 300k at 3.2% on a 15 year or 300k at 3.9% on a 30 year. 

My instinct is to take the lower APR for a shorter time, but I understand that may be wrong. Can you explain to me in what situation the higher APR/longer loan term would be better?

I opened a betterment Roth IRA on november 7 2014. I opened this roth specifically so I would be less inclined to withdraw any of the money. I opened it with $100 and have deposited $100 every month which means i have invested $2400 of my own money with no withdrawals. To date the value of the account is $2396.04, for a two year gain of -$4.09. Ive earned $61.35 in dividends and lost $56.35 due to market change and $9.09 in fees. The allocation is 90/10 stocks/bonds. So needless to say Im personally not very impressed. I understand that investing is supposed to be looked at in macro over the long haul but to have negative growth over a two year period that has seen pretty sustained growth of the stock market overall leads me to believe these guys really dont know what they are doing.

16-11-20,5e0zfv,"21 years old, 50k to invest? Index or RoboAdvisor","Hi,

First time posting in investing. I was wondering if anyone had any advice for me. 

I'm currently 21 and my fiance and I have 50k from successful business ventures and will come out with no student debt. I am a finance major and have background in business so generally, I know how markets work.

I have not been maxing my Roth, since up until this year I have not had a taxable income that allows me to input. That being said, I was looking at somewhere to invest, I had previously had it in Fidelity S&amp;P 500 index fund and got a 5% return for a half year, but then moved it to Fidelity Go under an aggressive allocation which has not had amazing return thus far. That being said, I was wondering what would be advised, as I don't mind risk, but, I also don't want to blow money as I had before (invested in Aeropostale).

None of this money is emergency money as I've had the opportunity to attend a great university and have interned in places that have set me up to be a competitive candidate anywhere.

Also, my fiance (nothing on paper yet)  is not a US citizen and about 20k is hers, currently I am transferring that into my account slowly. Her country doesn't really tax (Arab Gulf), so I was wondering if there is anyway she could invest those without messing with my taxes.

Thanks!

I have 50 shares of AAPL from having worked at the Apple Store for a few years and getting it through our ESPP. It's important to note I'm not some maniacal Apple supporter. I (used to) like their products, but it was a job. I say ""used to"" because lately there's been some bad press for them: removing the headphone jack on the iPhone 7; not removing it on the new MacBooks and adding a stupid Touchbar; being so full of themselves to sell a $300 picture book; and general declining reliability of their hardware.

What I'm getting at here is - should I sell? Or are there scientific indicators that say I should stay the course? I'm worried their stock will drop because they've been bungling a lot of their product reveals lately, and I also have long thought Cook doesn't have what it takes, and definitely lacks the charisma Jobs had.",6

Do you think that oil ETFs are mostly priced in for the OPEC oil production cut at this point? 

Oil ETFs like $UWTI, $UCO, $XOP are still at near 52-week lows. This makes me think that these ETFs have not been priced in at this point. Looking at the stock charts, these ETFs could double in price over the next year or so. 

Oil drilling shares are at record lows. Look at $ESV, $NE and $RIG for example.

Historically, if you check AAPL, AMZN, or GOOG's charts, there was always a point where they all dropped about 50% from their high moving average after a great initial run, looking like Tesla's, before going up again. Apple's pre-2009 drop chart looks eerily similar to Tesla's.

A $133 share price brings us to a 20 billion market cap, which seems more reasonable than the current price.

16-11-21,5e4zbi,Euro hitting lows not seen since 2002,"&gt; Following Donald Trump’s election, Citigroup said it had shifted its euro-dollar forecast “180 degrees.” **The bank now predicts the euro will tumble to 98 U.S. cents** in the next six to 12 months. Last week, others joined the bank in predicting parity. On Monday the euro rose 0.3% against the dollar to trade at $1.0624........

&gt; Introduced in 1999, the common currency spent much of its early years below parity, falling to as low as 83 cents in 2000, when there was a strong U.S. economy and a weak one in Europe. But the currency has traded above $1 since late 2002, climbing to a high of $1.60 as the U.S. struggled with the financial crisis in 2008......


&gt;  Analysts were last predicting parity in early 2015, when the euro was dragged down by the ECB’s introduction of quantitative easing, a bond-buying program designed to push down interest rates. That March, the euro fell to as low as $1.046. **But U.S. interest-rate increases didn’t occur as fast as economists were predicting** [EDITORS NOTE: lmfao], [puncturing the trade.](http://www.wsj.com/articles/euro-dollar-flirt-with-parity-1479565238)

I understand that the best way to deal with this is to sell some of the proceeds and re-balance but I still expect said stock to have some more room to grow. What other strategy can I employ?

16-11-21,5e571a,Bird Construction -- anybody with a view?,"Hey,

Thinking of buying a good chunk of Bird Construction (BDT.TO) on the TSX due to the current valuation. Came onto my radar after the div cut they just made on their last earnings call. According to my research and going back to 2010 until now, Bird has seen a 91.5% increase in its sales , has decreased and monitored spending by 250% and except for 2012 (going to look further and see what the cause was , perhaps a special situation), and has always had POSITIVE free cash flow...

Now, here's the part I really like ... Bird is currently sitting on $202,000,000 of cash and investments as of their last report and the market has them currently valued at ~ $375,000,000.

If I were to look @ current year only and so some analysis:

sales : $ 1,572,600,000 
Gross profit: $115,260,000
SG&amp;A/Op expenses/Other expenses/unusual charges: $57,220,000

EBIT: $58,040,000
less taxes of $10,130,000
Consolidated net income of $47,910,000
+Amort - capital spending: 
$47,290,000

So now say i'm rich enough to buy the company myself ... what is fair value?

If I am looking for the FCF to represent at least a 10% return, I would need my initial investment to be:
$472,900,000 (10% of this # is the $47,290,000 above)
+ all cash in bank account  $202,240,000
less long term debt (want a clean plate) of 57,910,000

Target market cap of $617,190,000
Target price per share $14.52
Current price per share $8.78
Current Market cap 374.15

Current free cash flow yield

~20.5%

Would love you guys to chime in and let me know what you are thinking  :)

When instead they could have been very large gains. Another downside is I miss other opportunities due to no free money available while I'm waiting for the market to react to catalysts.

A great example of this is AMD. I bought it at 6.5 back in august. If you follow it at all 6.5 has been a pretty average, not terrible, but not a great buy in price either. It jumped up to 8 then went down to around $5.8 for a short while, but it has stuck around $6.5 for the majority of the time.

Hopefully I'm asking this question in the right place, I'm hoping for serious replies. It's perhaps more along the lines of swing trading. But I am choosing decent companies to hold long, but I'd love to be able to take advantage of market conditions to get better cost basis.

Quote:
A when-issued stock has yet to see the light of day. The official day of issuance is a few business days off, and for a brief period you can trade in shares without being able to settle for a profit or a loss. It's common for treasury bonds to trade on a when-issued basis, as speculators guess at the rise or fall of the bonds on the day they actually come up for auction. With stocks, when-issued trading only takes place when there is widespread interest and demand for the stock.

For those that don't know, this is for Pixelmags RM into SPCL SHELL.

.....""the official day of issuance is a few business days off"" - the 'V' was spotted first, on Thursday, I believe.

16-11-21,5e5wky,Software/Webpage for drawing trend lines (Manually),"Hi, I'm a stock trader newbie and still learning the basics. I've dug up quite a few sites that provide free stock chats (Finviz, etc.). However, none of them seem to provide good tools for manually drawing trend lines, which makes it quite hard to analyse charts. I was hoping that this community might know free tools/sites where such drawing &amp; analysis is possible.

I'm an analyst that works on the sell side at a fairly large investment bank. Given my experience has largely (and by largely I mean basically entirely) surrounded the income statement, I'm looking for the best ways to learn about analyzing cash flow and balance sheet statements.

Generally I know that high ROE, ROIC and FCF conversion are all good things, but outside of that I'd love to read a few books/articles that could really explain this to me as I eventually hope to be a value investor at a hedge fund (which I know largely surrounds BS/CF statement analysis).

Pixelmags annual revenues:

2014 - 30 mil
2015 - 48 mil
2016 - ???

PPS calculated from revenue and current Outstanding Share Structure

Post split, your investment will retain value - both OS and AS restructuring - this is NECESSARY to take Pixelmags to the big boards. After RS - THIS WILL NOT LOOK LIKE A PENNY STOCK

This is an actual company with REAL ANNUAL REVENUES OVER $60 MILLION - there's also a healthy positive earnings guidance, STRONG support* and healthy trading/liquidity - there will be no need for dilution because Pixelmags is a LEADER IN AN EMERGING MARKET projected to grow past 35bn in 2020....

Strong support -
Many longs have been invested since 0.0001, there is one with OVER 100 MILLION SHARES. However many shares you plan on buying, if any, im SURE will be less than 100 million

A lot of longs intend on keeping of their shares through 2020.  I personally ha e x MILLION shares, and intend on vetting my shares through 2020-keeping the bulk of my shares in for the long haul.

SHUTTERSTOCK had similar revenues when they had their IPO, and have a similar monetization structure....

SSTK opened at $17 and closed just under $22, during its IPO - within the first year, SSTK saw $98/share, and is currently trading around $50

My 401k is contributed up to the match (because it's ran by John Hancrook), Roth IRA and my wife's Traditional IRA is maxed. My SEP IRA gets the max it's allowed based on my side-gig's net income.

I have my 3 months of liquid savings, no credit card debt, and just my home and cars at a ridiculously low interest rates so they'll get paid off when they are scheduled to be paid off (I won't be buying another car for at least 10 years).

I'm 39. Risk tolerance is great.

I've got a watchlist of a zillion stocks, but I'm basically frozen because I don't know what stocks to actually buy into. I was hoping the market would have tanked by now to make the decisions that much easier. 

The minimum I want to invest in each stock is $2000 to keep my expenses under 1/2% (I'm with Schwab), so that means I need to figure out what my 5 best ideas are. I plan on repeating this process every year with another $4-10k so I need some sort of system.

16-11-21,5e66hk,BDT.TO - Bird Construction,"Hey,

Thinking of buying a good chunk of Bird Construction (BDT.TO) on the TSX due to the current valuation. Came onto my radar after the div cut they just made on their last earnings call. According to my research and going back to 2010 until now, Bird has seen a 91.5% increase in its sales , has decreased and monitored spending by 250% and except for 2012 (going to look further and see what the cause was , perhaps a special situation), and has always had POSITIVE free cash flow...

Now, here's the part I really like ... Bird is currently sitting on $202,000,000 of cash and investments as of their last report and the market has them currently valued at ~ $375,000,000.

If I were to look @ current year only and so some analysis:

sales : $ 1,572,600,000 Gross profit: $115,260,000 SG&amp;A/Op expenses/Other expenses/unusual charges: $57,220,000

EBIT: $58,040,000 less taxes of $10,130,000 Consolidated net income of $47,910,000 +Amort - capital spending: $47,290,000

So now say i'm rich enough to buy the company myself ... what is fair value?

If I am looking for the FCF to represent at least a 10% return, I would need my initial investment to be: $472,900,000 (10% of this # is the $47,290,000 above) + all cash in bank account $202,240,000 less long term debt (want a clean plate) of 57,910,000

Target market cap of $617,190,000 Target price per share $14.52 Current price per share $8.78 Current Market cap 374.15

Current free cash flow yield

~20.5%

16-11-21,5e3wcv,My growth stock portfolio for 2017. Predicting a 50%+ gain overall. My reasoning included.,"My growth stock portfolio will be $60K, expecting a return of 50%+, so will be expecting to be at least $90K by end of next year. 

Here are my picks:
$GM
$AUPH
$RSXJ
$RSX
$AMD (will add January 2017 after Fed rate hike)
$NVDA (will add January 2017 after Fed rate hike)
$TSLA (a big maybe, will add January 2017 if it dips to around $150; if not then I will not buy)
$MTL

Reasoning:
$GM - Trump loves $GM despite what he said about his concerns regarding overseas manufacturing. $GM has better financials compared to $F and $TSLA and with new electric car lineup like the 2017 Chevy Bolt Electric, I think $GM is due for a bull run soon (which has already started). 

$AUPH - Voclosporin will most likely be approved in 2017, and this stock has a 117%+ upside potential according to the median analyst's estimates if this indeed does go through as planned. There is no reason for this not to happen unless voclosporin causes patient deaths, which the last study did not attribute to. 

$RSXJ and $RSX- With Trump's presidency, sanctions against Russia will gradually be loosened. I don't expect a dramatic loosening of sanctions as the GOP will be cautious. However, I do predict a much better relationship between the US and Russia with Trump in power as opposed to Obama/Hillary. $RSXJ has more growth stock holdings like $AFLT and $MTL, whereas $RSX has more blue chips like $OGZPY, which should improve more dramatically as oil prices rise after the OPEC meeting. 

$AMD - This is a bit of a gamble but I do think that a favorable product line-up in 2017 will boost AMD's market share in both CPUs and CPUs. AMD is mainly concentrating in capturing more market share from Intel and Nvidia at this stage, rather than investing in new growth engines. 

$NVDA - This will probably undergo some corrections by the time the Fed raises rates. I'm expecting a 5% pullback and this will be a good entry point. NVDA just has too much momentum going for it, with AI and driverless cars. 

$TSLA - Tesla has a chance to be a real growth stock if Trump takes a lighter stance on the company's inclination to green energy (solar power). Very much a dark horse ATM, but seeing how advanced its driverless car technology is, I really don't see it falling below $150 unless Trump's policies ruins the industry. 

$MTL - A Russian ADR which will see continuous explosive growth through 2017 if the Russian economy does grow as forecast. Expect more infrastructure as Russia gets back on track to improving the economy rather than fighting in Crimea and the Middle East.

16-11-21,5e6lcx,stockAday: putting Cerner on the backburner? $CERN,"# Key Stats for Cerner Corporation

So with everyone awaiting Mr T. and his views on Obamacare, is it time to take a rain check on Cerner?

# Description
Cerner Corporation is a supplier of healthcare information technology. And it's used at 20,000 facilities worldwide, including hospitals, physician practices, laboratories, etc etc. Though circa 90% of sales are in the US.

For example, here's how they describe their business:

&gt; * Cerner Millennium allows providers to securely access an individual’s electronic health record (EHR) at the point of care, and it organizes and proactively delivers information to meet the specific needs of physicians, nurses, laboratory technicians, pharmacists, front- and back-office professionals and consumers. 
&gt; * On the HealtheIntent platform, we offer EHR-agnostic solutions that help health care systems aggregate, transform and reconcile data across the continuum of care, manage the health of populations they serve, improve outcomes and lower costs.

&gt;  We have systems in more than 20,000 facilities worldwide, including hospitals, physician practices, laboratories, ambulatory centers, behavioral health centers, cardiac facilities, radiology clinics, surgery centers, extended care facilities, retail pharmacies, and employer sites.

When it comes to industry trends, they point out that 

&gt;  In 2014, U.S. health care spending increased 5.5 percent to $3.0 trillion, representing 17.7 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimates U.S. health care spending in 2015 at $3.2 trillion, or 18.0 percent of GDP, and projects it to be 19.6 percent of GDP by 2024. We believe health care IT is one of few remaining levers that can change this trajectory.

Wonder what Mr. T thinks about that!

## Recent financials 

Now the business bought Siemens Health Services in early 2015 for $1.3bn in cash, which boosted the 2015 figures.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $4.4bn | $3.4bn | $2.9bn | $2.7bn | $2.2bn|
|EPS | $1.54 | $1.50 | $1.13 | $1.13 | $0.88|

Looking at the first nine month sales are up 9%, margins up substantially, earnings too. The company also reports its *revenue backlog* i.e. contracted but not delivered, and it stood at $15.5bn at the end of Sept. Wow.

## Competition

Here's how they see the competition:

&gt; The market for HCIT solutions, devices and services is intensely competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological change. Our principal competitors in the health care solutions and services market each offer a suite of software solutions that compete with many of our software solutions and services. These competitors include, but are not limited to: Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc.; Healthland, Inc.; Computer Programs and Systems, Inc.; McKesson Corporation; Epic Systems Corporation; MEDHOST, Inc.; GE Healthcare Technologies; Medical Information Technology, Inc.

Though they highlight a long list of other competitors. Looking at margins and returns, they are stand-out best. Though revenue mix makes this a difficult comparison.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Cerner Corporation | $4,714M | 30% | 16%
Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc | $1,470M | 16% | 0%
Computer Programs &amp; Systems, Inc. | $247M | 11% | 5%
athenahealth, Inc | $1,052M | 15% | 3%
Quality Systems, Inc. | $494M | 10% | -2%
The Advisory Board Company | $803M | 18% | -10%

## Cash / Debt?

Cerner Corporation has $120M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 1% of the market value of Cerner Corporation.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $62.90 for Cerner Corporation and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 27% to their target.

# Valuation

So in the HC IT market, CERN is the gorilla in the room. They've got the revenues, the margins, the cashflow and the valuation! Compared with the peers, it's valuation reflects this with a circa 10% premium.

So what's going to get the stock higher? Sentiment? Or is it earnings growth?

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/cern.o/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
CERN.O | $16,815M | 22x | 14% | 0% | 7%
MDRX.O | $2,008M | 19x | 15% | 0% | 8%
CPSI.O | $336M | 14x | 14% | 9% | 14%
ATHN.O | $4,059M | 59x | 27% | 0% | 4%
QSII.O | $859M | 18x | 13% | 0% | 3%
ABCO.O | $1,443M | 20x | 16% | 0% | 0%

# Dividends

Cerner Corporation is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. Instead they have the right to do buybacks of up to $500m. 

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -23% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -3%. With most of the fall coming in the last month. Okay so they missed earnings at the last quarter and forecasts have been pulled in, but 20% off? 

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers they forecast, 11% revenue growth and 13% earnings growth. Okay it's not a rocket, but it's hardly a bad figures! What am I missing?

Can Mr T. really turn the healthcare industry upsidedown? And if he does, how's that bad for an IT provider driving efficiencies?

Rain check or write a check?

In essence, Twitter is looking a bit guilty by banning accounts that are acting as a watchdog group for pedophile accounts on twitter those same accounts are still active.

It certainly looks like they're trying to protect and censor any news.  Even other media such as the NYT is addressing it carefully without any substance to calm nerves.  

If this past election has anything about it, it is quite possible that these alternative news sources could cause a real shitstorm in the next 2 to 3 months.

If anything else, these shits never turned a profit in their life, the only relevance they have is hope nowadays.  Eventually, they'll fall either way without a buyout.  ",18

Right now, the market's implying a 94% chance of a 25 bp hike - http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html. 

The post-election moves have been strong to say the least. I totally get the euphoria over Trumponomics the market has right now, but the FOMC can't be ignored. Given that, some of these flows are undoubtedly for pre-FOMC positioning. So the question is what's the current picture look like of that positioning? I think bonds and currencies have definitely priced in, as well as the dollar. I'm definitely less confident about equities though. All 3 U.S. broke all time highs this week, and seemingly pushing through big psychological levels with ease. So far this cycle, most hints of a hike coming have depressed equities.

I know for GIPS you start the inclusion the first day of the next month, but what about client performance reports? 


Another issue is what if the client brings in 75% of the assets in one month, then 25% the second month. Do you start benchmarking from when the first chunk of money came in? or do you start when the full amount is received?

It seems like electric cars are making a breakthrough, and of course that power must come from a source most likely oil. Therefore other methods of energy generation like nuclear, wind, and what I consider the biggest- solar will have to become the new forms once oil eventually runs scarce. Does this mean (theoretically) if I bought solar energy stocks today, which have taken a beating the past 2 years, could rise and possibly be the newest form of energy generation in a few years? I really do believe oil will peak in 2020, and have done lots of research on the matter. Some say new methods of energy will replace oil before it ever runs out. Either way, would you consider solar energy stocks a wise investment?",0

16-11-23,5eelfk,HFT as a carrier wave for insider trading?,"So here's something I've been wondering about. High Frequency Trading occurs at a millisecond, sometimes even microsecond scale. It's entirely automated by scripts, bots and AI, with various degrees of cleverness. From signal processing it is known that you can encode arbitrary information in these trades using Amplitude Modulation (AM) or Frequency Modulation (FM). Essentially you can say ""hello world"" by encoding the data into bits, and then sending those bits over an AM or FM carrier wave. Now here's where it gets interesting, what if a secret agreement was made between the companies running these bots about encoding &amp; encrypting certain insider information. Company A wants to do a pump&amp;dump scheme, signals this using the HFT modulations, company B sees this and participates. Company A signals the ""end"", company B participates. Both profit, nobody knew. It would be impossible to detect too, since the data when encrypted properly would be indistinguishable from noise. The bandpass for the signal doesn't even need to be large, since you can validate whether or not a message was real trading or a secret communication via some key or checksum.

The Russian stock market is different. It may be trading at all-time highs but its economy is expected to return to growth in 2017 and it has already begun its bull run. 

ETFs like RSX and RSXJ have gained 93% and 105% respectively this year alone. Industrial stocks like $MTL have gained 300%+ in 2017. 

You guys might be saying ""How can you say that the US stock market wont go higher?"" 

Yes, it might. However all indicators are suggesting that investors are hesitant to buy at the new record-highs and the weekly doji candle suggests hesitancy in the markets. And with the December interest rates striking soon, this could be another 10% drop we saw earlier this year and maybe even 20% or 50%. 

Again, I'm not saying that this will happen. The markets may go up higher. But upside potential is limited IMO. 

Russian ETFs and ADRs are a better choice in this market climate. These ETFs and ADRs are listed on the US stock exchange and can be traded like any other shares/ETFs. 

Any uncertainties in the US is Russia's economic gain:

16-11-22,5e7yi8,Erase the Pattern Day Trader rule via the President,"Unique opportunity guys, there's basically the opportunity to get the SEC itself de-chartered or declared unconstitutional with the new court, but lets not go that far [yet].

POTUS is going to writing executive orders on day one to remove regulations from businesses. But these aren't binding, they are guidelines, like quarterly goals for Federal agencies. So even if he was like ""Pattern Day Trading rule is repealed"", the SEC has to decide to implement it, and FINRA isn't even effected.

So since the PDT only affects peons without a voice, thats not the angle to take. Instead, you need to bring up the COMPLIANCE COSTS that all these brokers have in freezing your margin accounts when your MACD analysis gets stopped out the same fucking day.

The SEC is running around autonomously like a chicken with its head. There are supposed to be five commissioners that make regulations, there are three right now, one of which is the chair. The chair is stepping down as soon as POTUS inauguration. President Trump gets to place 3 out of five of the SEC commissioners with whoever the fuck he wants (including you or I), let alone the chairman. Shit just got real.

So NOW he can issue executive orders saying what the agency should focus on, AND have people that won't even think twice about it. 

Now we can get PDT erased, without the courts. Regarding FINRA's duplicate regulations, they'll fall in line. Upboat",52

16-11-22,5ebe5d,What is the deal with MotleyFool,"I did a search in this sub and came up with three results. One of them mentioned that site seemed Buzzfeed-ish and I certainly agree with that post. Doing Google searches I'm not sure if they're paying for their positive page ranking results, but the reviews are much more positive. 

So I signed up for one of the free accounts three weeks ago. And for the most part the emails are reminding me to become a paying subscriber. Within the last week one is about the lowest price subscription, and that the deal would run out in a couple of days. They've since extended the offer once or twice telling me time is running out. This screams shady to me. 

I am only a long term investor. Any regular spending money (bills, mortgage, food, luxuries, etc) I keep in short term accounts. It seemed like the way MotleyFool were advertising their service it seemed right up my alley for their buy and hold advice. Now I'm put off.

16-11-22,5e86km,Not sure what to do with my BHI stock given Baker Hughes and General Electric are merging mid 2017.,"I was laid off from Baker Hughes over a year ago, but I still carry a lot of their stock. Less than a month ago, it was announced that GE and BHI were merging their oil and gas business together. Since then, the stock has jumped from about $55/share to now about $62/share.

Now obviously, I'm not asking everyone to predict how high it will go, but I'm not sure how this following part of the deal works.

&gt;The terms of the deal have been agreed upon by the boards of both companies. At the closing of the transaction, Baker Hughes shareholders will receive a special one-time cash dividend of $17.50 per share and 37.5% of the new company. GE will own 62.5% of the company. The transaction is expected to close in mid 2017.

Source: http://www.investopedia.com/news/general-electric-merge-oil-and-gas-business-baker-hughes-ge-bhi/

I don't quite understand how the one-time cash dividend of $17.50/share works. Does that mean when the deal finally completes next year, all my shares now yield me an extra $17.50 at the BHI stock price. That seems incredibly high? Am I right to think that even if the stock prices plummet back down to say $45/share. I would still come out slightly ahead? (45+17.60 = $62.50 &gt; than the current $62/share price). What prevents someone from just buying stock right now and benefitting from the one-time dividend down the road? I'm guessing there's some sort of restriction on owning the stock before the deal was announced?

I just want to make sure I know everything before I do anything since right now I have a limit order of $63/share.",0

# Description

They've a rather grand vision of themselves

&gt; We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. We are guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. 

So what does that mean? 

Amazon.com, Inc. offers a range of products and services through its Websites. Both products it purchases for resale and products offered by 3rd parties. It's got 3 divisions:

* North America
* International
* Amazon Web Services (AWS)

So we all know the amazon.com service, but what's AWS? Well as a start-up, Stockflare's built upon AWS. And surprisingly some of Amazon's competitors, like Netflix also store all their mission critical code on AWS servers! AWS allows anyone launch an online service without owning severs themselves. Nice eh? Wait until you see the margin. :)

And when it comes to innovation... well there is AWS okay, then there is the Kindle, and Amazon Prime, and Amazon Local, and Originals,  etc etc...so the Bezos vision... of the ""Everything Store"" is coming together!

## Recent financials 

THe growth is shocking, in a good way. 

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $107bn | $89bn | $74bn | $61bn | $48bn|
|EPS | $1.25 | -$0.52 | $0.59 | -$0.09 | $1.37|

And for 2016 the forecast is sales of $137bn.

When it comes to profit's it's sort of *funny*, as it's AWS that turns a profit, with the North America and International divisions flip in and out of profit. Yes, they are investing, I know. Here's the first 9 months of 2016:

|9M 2016|Sales|Operating Profit| % |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|North America | $53.5bn | $1.5bn | 3% | 
|International | $30.0bn | -$0.8bn | -ve | 
|AWS | $8.7bn | $2.2bn | 25% |

## Competition

The competition section of their annuals rather funny, as they say pretty much everyone is their competitor, though they divide them into 7 groups:

1. all retailers
2. publishers, producers, media distributors of all distribution channels
3. search engines &amp; social networks
4. e-commerce companies
5. fulfilment &amp; logistics 
6. cloud computing IT firms
7. electronic device manufacturers

But to keep our lives simple, let's look at retail-first and digital-first competitors.

At a glance the margin looks good relative to WMT and COST. Though quite a bit behind HD. 

Given the structure of it's business I can't see it ever getting to Google of Netflix's margins, though if we look at the margins of AWS they aren't as good as the digital competitors, though it's not a fair comparison since they are not infrastructure based IT services companies. Though [Rackspace](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/rax/breakdown/latest) has a 32% margin v 25% for AWS.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Amazon.com, Inc. | $127,993M | 9% | 14%
Retail-First | | | 
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. | $484,604M | 7% | 18%
Home Depot Inc | $93,368M | 16% | 116%
Costco Wholesale Corporation | $118,719M | 4% | 21%
Digital-First | | | 
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd | $18,163M | 36% | 15%
Alphabet Inc | $85,537M | 33% | 15%
Netflix, Inc. | $8,176M | 59% | 7%
eBay Inc | $8,906M | 34% | 28%

However, given Bezos' vision and his focus on being always cheaper it's not impossible that they shall always have a slightly lower margin than their competitors. But if the top line's good, well who cares!

## Cash / Debt?

Amazon.com, Inc. has $10,142M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 3% of the market value of Amazon.com, Inc. so if they woke up one day and decided to buy Snapchat from under Zuckerberg's nose it wouldn't be hard to do!

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $922.38 for Amazon.com, Inc. and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 18% to their target.

# Valuation

It's really hard to see the logic behind that $920 price target. It's clearly not PE driven...however, if you look at price to sales, and say that AMZN's current 2.6x forecast sales will rise to the sector average of 3.2x sales, then sure!

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/amzn.o/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
AMZN.O | $370,630M | 164x | 35% | 0% | 3%
Retail-First | |  |  |  | 
WMT | $214,579M | 16x | 1% | 3% | 14%
HD | $158,425M | 20x | 14% | 2% | 8%
COST.O | $66,080M | 25x | 10% | 1% | 7%
Digital-First | |  |  |  | 
BABA.K | $231,090M | 29x | 27% | 0% | 3%
GOOGL.O | $535,531M | 23x | 19% | 0% | 5%
NFLX.O | $50,622M | 295x | 64% | 0% | 9%
EBAY.O | $32,420M | 15x | 8% | 0% | 8%

But frankly, I find it hard to believe that these metrics are really anything more than a place to hang your emotional belief in Bezos.

# Dividends

Amazon.com, Inc. is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. The company hasn't ever paid one. And although they have a 6 year old authorisation to buy back stock, they rarely do it. In effect... it's invest invest invest at Amazon.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 2% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -17%. Wow. Obviously at 160x this years earnings, the EPS figure is irrelevant today. In fact, perhaps the key is the believe in 2017 and beyond. For example the current forecast is for sales to grow 20%+ and earnings to double.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, they were tight lipped about 2017 and it's funny that anytime someone highlighted a potential negative, e.g. lower margins in International, the immediate response is ""we are investing"".

So, I suppose the history of them investing is pretty consistent, and to date their investment has continued to drive topline growth, impressively. They are bigger than HD and COST now in terms of sales. It would be a brave person to bet they won't be larger than Wal-Mart in the next 20 years. Maybe 10 years?

Of course, that won't stop the stock periodically dropping $100-150 a share when the market loses confidence in AMZN, though it appears to typically be temporary *lovers' tiffs*.

16-11-22,5ec6rk,PIP: PharmAthene,"I think I may have found an arbitrage play with this, but I need to have someone play devil's advocate and tell me why this wouldn't/couldn't work. $PIP just declared a $2.91 special dividend due to a cash payout from a settlement of a lawsuit with $SIGA. $PIP is currently trading at $3.10/sh, I say you buy up as many shares as possible, and couple this with long puts at a 2.50 strike. That way, on ex dividend date, if/when the price falls hypothetically by the dividend amount, you collect the value of the put options, and come out even in terms of the long position on the stock. 

The purpose of the long position on the stock would essentially be insurance. Say the stock rises steadily until the dividend payout date (2/3/2017), you could either sell it to realize a capital gain, or hold through the ex-dividend date. Now if the stock doesn't fall by the amount of the dividend on the ex-dividend date for whatever reason, the put options may not be in the money, but you would have realized a capital gain on the long equity position. If you size the positions appropriately, I believe this to be an arbitrage play, but I could be wrong.

16-11-22,5ec90o,$SEC - Exempt CFDs from OTC regulations via the President,"Contracts for Difference are widely traded in a variety of country's financial markets, but are banned for all intents and purposes from US markets and US residents due to being an ""Over the Counter"" product that only accredited investors can use.

Brokers generally use this to offer 24/7 trading in international markets with LOTS and LOTS of leverage, and its a lot of fun.

The SEC regulates financial instruments that are securities and are derived from securities in two ways: subject to regulation and not subject to regulation but only available to rich people. This raises compliance costs and destroys liquidity in some markets within the US. Foreign brokers that don't have to worry about such coddling aren't even able to offer products to US residents, to avoid the massive dick of the SEC.

President Trump is in the unique position to issue executive orders telling the SEC what to do, as well as appoint 3 out of 5 SEC Commissioners including the Chair of the SEC, who will do what he wants, making it open season on any and all regulations we want.

Lets get CFDs in the US! This will also make it much easier for US residents/citizens to trade foreign issues, as well as every other kind of market (even more prediction markets). In the name of hedging, of course.",3

16-11-22,5ecbi7,$CFTC - Repealing Dodd Frank puts Movie Ticket Futures back on the table,"Think the new Batman movie is going to do pretty good? Want to ""hedge your multi million dollar investment"" in the remake? (yeah right). Well futures contracts on movie ticket sales are about to be back on the table!

History lesson! When Box Office Futures were proposed, the CFTC was all for it. The Commodities Futures and Trading Commission loves trading! This is distinct from the Securities Exchange Commission. The CFTC gives zero fucks and loves this shit.

The CFTC loved the idea of box office futures and was drafting regulations for putting traders in movie studios and implementing chinese walls. The MPAA and therefore CONGR€$$ literally facepalmed at this idea and passed new laws specifically banning box office futures and any contract like it from being traded in the United States. So, onion futures and box office futures are the only two futures contracts that can't be offered. Sorry, cows and slaves, you aren't important enough.

This was slid into the Dodd Frank act, which is on thin ice.

President Trump is in the unique position to issue an executive order telling the CFTC to focus on this, and resurrect their sanctioning of these futures, after Dodd Frank is torn to shreds.

New to this sub but I had a question that maybe anyone here could answer.  I owned 50 shares of SCTY that converted to 5.5 shares of TSLA this morning.  Now in my ETrade account it's registering the buy price at $50/share, where I bought into SCTY, and therefore the return on that investment now that it's TSLA is something absurd like 278%.  Now my concern is that when tax time comes around, I should be writing off the loss from my initial SCTY investment not a gain on the TSLA (hypothetically if I sold).  I brought it up with Etrade SM but haven't gotten a response back.  

Am I just missing something or am I correct in assuming I should be able to write down that loss?

The price is discounted at this rate and should hit $4 by 12/12. Ex date for the dividend is 12/13 and pay date is 12/30.

16-11-22,5e8zcu,"I'm starting to look at gold. Looking good.","This would hinge completely on gold price recovering but reward would be massive.

I like companies that are ignored by the market (another reason I'm getting out of weed stocks now).

Something that people really stay away from (for obvious reasons) are countries that have had political strife. However, often people fail to realize when that place is safe again and a good place to do business. 

I found a few companies yesterday after doing some research that are in such jurisdictions, that have had respectable revenue growth and have been profitable and even grown EPS with low gold prices. 

They're getting completely ignored by the market, except today they were being noticed a little.

Macroeconomically, gold price sort of has to recover. I mean people could place their faith in Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency but that cannot take the value out of gold in any meaningful way, likely not for 25-100 years and probably never.

A lot of countries are near their [all time high for their debt VS 1 year gdp](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/country-list/government-debt-to-gdp).

Debt hasn't been used wisely and our currencies, likely even the USD, will begin to devalue. I think anyways. That's a long-term reason why gold will increase.

But in the short term, fear around Trump coming into office at noon on January 20 should be a healthy thing for gold price.

[http://www.incrementum.li/en/research-analysis/in-gold-we-trust-2016/](http://www.incrementum.li/en/research-analysis/in-gold-we-trust-2016/)

Page 136-141 are a nice summary of why gold will likely increase - this helps me justify to myself why I gamble instead of invest.

Of course I could be parking my money in a nice GoldCorp type company, but no. I'm looking at junior producers in geographies that have only 'recently' become politically stable. I've found ones with growing revenue, EPS, and good debt/assets, just because I want to have some chance of actually winning these gambits. But of course, they all still offer high returns (and astoundingly high risk).

Here's some I like for the coming year:

(TSX:GCM) [Colombia] Gran Colombia Gold Corp.

(TSX:OMI) [Uraguay] Orosur Mining Inc.

The bandwidth dwarfs that of 5G and just as new companies arose when broadband internet became available like YouTube, Netflix, social media and so on I expect many new companies to take advantage of the new wireless bandwidth available. 

Does anyone have thoughts on how one should invest in 5G? This can include the roll out of 5G but also any ideas for how 5G can be utilized.

This is the article that got me thinking.

16-11-22,5ed46c,AKAO Phase III/Long,"I like to lose money on microcap biotechs, as is tradition.

AKAO is a microcap pharma developing plazomicin, which targets muti drug resistent bacteria.

Heres what I like:

* Phase II trials went well, met all end points, no significant AEs

* Two Phase III trails were moved forward to release data in Q4 2016, rather than 2017

* Float is only 15M, which means good data should move the stock easily

* Company has been good at securing non-dilutive funding/grants

* Went public at end of 2014, raised a lot of cash, has several chief officers with great backgrounds (not a single employee in a single room in NYC #AVXLthrowback)

* Never mentioned on WSB before this

* Has a good pipeline for more than just plazomicin

* biotech is hot rn

Heres what I don't like:

* Probably going to need to raise money before launch date, hopefully through non-dilutive funding, but obviously that's hard to get

* Not a blockbuster drug at all, antibiotics aren't high margin.  This is partly why they have been able to avoid major dilution, they keep getting grants because gov't wants to see new antibiotics to address resistance.

* Phase III trials being moved hasn't impacted NDA date or launch date, and they said in conf call that it was because manufacturing is the limiting factor at this point.  

* A peer of theirs, $CEMP, got rekt over supplier issues earlier (making everyone fearful).


Anyway, I'm in with some yolo money (500*4.90 cost avg), and will buy another 500 or so shares if it goes down leading up to the end of Q4.  I hope to sell after the data release, and buy back in closer to the NDA date.  whatever.",16

Proposition (and I've already done the trade):

Sell 10 call contracts at $65 strike expiring Dec 16th
Sell 10 put contracts at $20 strike price expiring Dec 16th

You will collect approx $8200 today in premium. As long as the stock doesn't go above $73 or below $12 you will profit. More than likely the stock won't go beyond the strike prices in the next 16 trading days so they should expire worthless. 

You need approx 11k in assets in your account to do this with 10 contracts of each.

- Any index hits an all time high? Must be time for a crash!
- Some macro-level international political event occurs (ie, Brexit)? Must be time for a crash!
- Some macro-level domestic political event occurs (ie, Donald Trump)? Must be time for a crash!
- Any meeting related to the Federal Reserve and interest rates in the next 30 days? Must be time for a crash!
- Any commodity at a high level or low level (gold, oil, whatever)? Must be time for a crash!

Stop it. You are all so bad at this (because retail investors in general are bad at it). It is the same posts year, after year, after year. ***Here is the thing: the market is cyclical, but it is not predictable. Try hard as you might to call the next crash, you will all be wrong 99% of the time.*** One of you will be right eventually, but no one knows who that will be or when that will be. Because no one knows when the next crash will be. Even when it occurs, ***there is no guarantee it will be a 2008-style crash with -50%+ drops in stocks. While those kind of crashes do occur, historically cyclical pull backs result in much more modest losses.***  

I hope no one is taking actual investment advice from the people here trying to call a crash. Because look back, they've been making the same posts in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and this year. They have all been wrong, and anyone listening to them has lost a lot of money.",720

16-11-22,5edzp5,Loophole in trading? Someone please explain why/how this would or would not work. Seems too simple,"Okay, humor this scenario:

Two friends, call them Bill and Ted, are both very well off financially (millionaires). And let’s say Bill has X amount of shares in stock XYZ, which he purchased for $9.00 several weeks prior. 
XYZ has an average 10-day trading volume of 100,000 and an average 90-day trading volume of 80,000
The stock, XYZ, is now at $10.00 and if Bill sold all his shares, he would have made a profit. A small profit but a profit nonetheless. 

Here’s the thing: Bill wants to increase this profit, by however much he can. Bill is good friends with Ted and asks Ted to purchase 10,000 shares (10% of the 10-day trading volume) of XYZ, at current asking price, thus creating a temporary surge in demand, driving the stock price of XYZ even higher than the current $10.00 (doesn’t matter how much, just matters that it went even higher than $10). The rest of the daily traders see this surge and suspect huge demand and start buying, creating sort of a self-fulfilled prophecy, if you will.

Now, Bill can sell his shares and make even more money than he would have if Ted hadn’t done what he did. And when Bill sells his shares, he lets Ted know he can sell his 10K shares at the same price he bought them at, with both friends getting out at roughly the same time. This increases Bill’s profit and yields a scenario for Ted with neither gain nor loss. Ted was just an instrument to increase demand (temporarily, unbeknownst to the rest of traders) and if Bill was a truly good friend he would give Ted some of the pie.

Does this work? How would it not work? Would it work if Ted purchased only 5% of the 10-day trading volume or would he have to purchase a much larger percentage, say 50%?

I am contemplating investing in the above ETF, only I don't understand the currency risk involved in this. 

I use the Euro. I do understand that i buy shares from companies in Brasil, Russia and China among others. So The Yuan, Ruble and Real are relevant. So if none of the companies increase in value concerning their stock prices, but the euro appreciates, i make a profit (I assume). 

But the ETF also states that the ""base currency"" is in USD; even though I can directly buy the ETF with Euros in my brokerage account. 

Does anyone know if and how this additionally affects my investment? if, for the sake of plainness: hypothetically all the underlying stock prices of all the companies would stay the same after 1 year.

16-11-23,5ejxbj,Need help picking 401k investment options. (x-post from /r/personalfinance),"My company recently switched 401k providers. With my new provider they put 100% of my funds into AmerCnt One Choice 2055 Ptf Fund as a starting point. Previoulsy I had my fuds split between 2 funds, AmFds Gr Fd Am R6  (large cap stocks)  75%  and Invsco SmCap Gr Inv  (small cap stocks) 25%

 I have to go in now and re-pick what funds I want to put my money into. I had some funds picked out previously with my old provider but I figured since I have to redo my funds and with recent political and international happenings, I would ask and see what is probably my best move as far as fund selection and investment. I try to be pretty aggressive with my fund selection. So i'm asking for any advice and reasons as to what funds I should select.

Also I just found out that I have a second 401k with Fidelity from a previous employer that has a balance of $343. They said that since ""your account has been identified as having a vested market value equal to or less than your plan’s minimum required balance.  In accordance with the plan provisions, if you do not elect to receive a distribution prior to 12/30/2016, your vested account balance will be distributed from the Plan."" I dont know what I should do with this 401k. Roll it over into my exsisting 401k? Turn this one into a Roth IRA? Not really sure what to do there.

Edit: These are my selection options

I can't speak to the stats, but mainly that is because there aren't any statistics I can find that are related to this theory because it isn't a widely discussed concept. I'd be really interested to know how much money that was sitting on the sidelines from retirees came back into the market with the Trump win. This also explains the gold decline. Many of these same older conservatives who listen to Glen Beck and Rush Limbaugh bought into gold instead of the market, because conservative media outlets were marketing fear of the US future by the boatload (as well as whatever gold endorsing product they were selling). Any thoughts on this theory? Contradictions? Would like some discussion...
Edit: *Disclaimer* It's just a theory based on personal experiences. I could be way off base. Texan girl here from semi-wealthy family, and when all of my parents and their also well off friends get together, they discuss this stuff annoyingly frequent. I've heard the same repetitive statements coming from them and also others in their social groups all behaved he same way post election.

Maybe they like that he wants to bring back the policies that made them all that money in the first place. Who knows...",0

16-11-23,5ehudg,Dividend yield timing and day trading questions.,"I have been researching for quite some time and I will be ready to make some moves in the stock market soon. My two main focus's at the moment is on stocks that pay dividend and getting to the 25k point. I don't have enough to do day trading but my goal here is to get my portfolio to 25-30k to begin day trading over the next few years.

Do all companies have different requirements as to dividend payout times for their stock holders e.x. A certain period of owning the stock before being allowed to be paid on it? or are all dividend payouts usually at the same time across the board? 

Can I purchase stocks that pay dividend at the right time to be sure I collect the dividend and then sell it before they adjust stock pricing for the payouts ? (must-own period) and is it legal?

Any thoughts on strategies for someone who can only start with 1-2k and wants to reach 25k within a few years to begin full time day trading? I have signed up to 4 different platforms and will find a few more. For now this allows me 16 trades in a given week.

https://www.parnassus.com/our-firm/highlight/190

Global water demand is expected to exceed supply by 40% over the next 15 years, according to the United Nations.
Leaks from aging infrastructure result in an estimated loss of 2.1 trillion gallons, or about one-sixth of the total drinking water in the U.S. annually, while developing countries lack the water infrastructure to support development.
Water and wastewater utilities in the U.S. release as much CO2 each year as that released by 10 million cars.
Climate change is projected to reduce water supplies due to heat and evaporation and to increased water quality problems attributed to flooding and rising sea levels.

""Xylem is the world’s largest provider of water and wastewater treatment solutions. The company holds leading positions across the water transportation, treatment and testing segments, as well as in the industrial water and irrigation markets""
""Pentair also offers compelling, cost-conscious water purification solutions, including filtration and desalination products designed to expand and improve the quality of the fresh water supply. Additional water-related products offered by Pentair include wastewater pumps, water-efficient irrigation systems and flow management valves and controls. These products aim to curtail water waste and sustain productive agriculture for the growing global population.""

""We view Xylem’s portfolio of products as one of the strongest in the industry. The company has a sticky installed customer base, strong brand loyalty, technology leadership and a global reach. Their large installed customer base allows Xylem to sell higher-margin aftermarket products and services. This aftermarket business represents close to 40% of the company’s revenue and provides a predictable and stable source of revenue and income. We also believe CEO Patrick Decker, who joined Xylem with a background in lean manufacturing and Six Sigma continuous improvement processes, has shown that he has the right skills and experience to lead the company.
Likewise, Pentair implemented lean techniques nearly a decade ago with the objective of reducing costs through operational efficiencies, supply chain management and cash flow management. We think that there is more upside to Pentair’s cost synergies target. As the company continues to exercise control over its margin-improvement trajectory, its operating margin will continue to improve, and the company will depend less on volume growth to drive earnings growth.""

16-11-23,5ei2b2,"SFOR - long &amp; strong!","$SFOR Time to Revisit 8 major catalysts Post Proxy def 14A 

Catalyst #1 &amp; #4 in Play: 

Catalyst #1 i.e. Big Settlement News is imminent as early as next week with combination of Catalyst #2, #3, #4 

Quote: 
1. Infringers - Currently 3, and 100's more to follow 
1.a Triggered on 09/22/16 when USPTO was updated http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=125392623 
1.b CEO Confirmation of Settlement on 08/04/16

1.c Conversion of preferred in 36m common shares- 10/03/16 
http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=125592194 

Note: This is very important piece of information as timing of proxy and conversion of preferred into commons in anticipation of big rise in pps.( preferred was held for long and timing couldn't be better just ahead of Proxy filing ) 
1.d Recent Pacer Update: 
http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=125172448 

Catalysts # 2,3 &amp; 4 are confirmed Deals (MEGA DEALS) as in 10Q ( Read Below ), Clients name &amp; Details will be forthcoming 

2. Large scale enterprise contracts ( They have Many ) 

3. Several Large scale OEM's deals 

4. Licensing of it's it's technology deals with both Hardware and Software manufactures

5. Big Retail market, where they are pushing hard ( $29.99/piece ) 

6. International Expansion- Already working on International Patents &amp; setting up European sales channel. 

7. Federal/Government Contracts &amp; 

8. Buyout: Don't rule out the BUYOUT, in which case all bets are off. 

It's just matter of time. The moment we see SFOR announces those several large scale enterprise contracts deals , Contracts/Deals from various OEM's and licencing deals of it's technology with both Hardware and Software manufactures , there will be no looking back. 

Since SFOR is already engaged in multiple production installations (From 10Q), I am betting we will hear these deals any day as well. 

Those who are still vouching R/S should listen to recent 
CEO's Interview on 09/21/16 CAREFULLY ( Pay Attention No R/S ): 

https://upticknewswire.com/ceo-mark-kay-with-strikeforce-technologies-why-anti-viruses-are-not-working-and-what-consumers-can-do-to-become-more-secure/

Now let's get the Proxy Agenda and bring it in perspective i.e. 
Quote: 

(1)To elect three members to the Company's Board of Directors to hold office until the Company's next Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 2017 or until each Director’s successor is duly elected and qualified; and 
(2)To ratify the appointment of Weinberg and Company, PA, as the Company's independent certified public accountants; 
(3)	To consider and, if deemed advisable, approve an advisory vote on executive compensation. 
(4)	To consider an advisory vote determining the frequency of future executive compensation advisory votes. 
(5)	To transact such other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting and any adjournment thereof. 

Well, first the timing of calling proxy with Settlement news pending/imminent, Announcement of several large scale deals i.e. Catalysts #2,3 &amp; 4, timely conversion of Preferred into commons just before the Proxy filings and quartley due around the same time frame tells me that the time has come for SFOR to announce the Big Settlement news with possibility of treble damages, royalties with large future revenue potential from these 3 infringers and releasing details of Catalysts #2,#3 &amp; #4 with possible big Government Contract and Buyout ( which IMO is my last priority ) 

Recent 10Q from 08/15/16 with Several LARGE DEALS: 
http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=125070068 

is a confirmation of SFOR is about to join the big league players shortly and there will be no looking back. Item #3 &amp; #4 from Proxy Agenda will come via big settlement and Large scale deal announcements. Many will be left behind in shock and awe for not doing the proper due-diligence on SFOR when they still had time.

I have already made 120% return this year (from $30K to $68K) from these 2 ETFs: $RSX and $RSXJ and one Russian ADR: $MTL.

And before people say: ""Russian money can't be trusted"", or ""Russian companies are known to go bankrupt/are corrupt/etc"", these are trustworthy ETFs managed by a US fund manager, as well as one of the most rapidly growing Russian companies, Mechel PAO. 

And I think they will go higher well into 2017~2020. Why?

http://www.seattletimes.com/business/western-investors-warm-to-russias-shriveled-economy/

The biggest western companies are pumping cash into Russia:
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-23/bouncing-back-putin-s-shrunken-economy-lures-foreign-investors

https://www.rt.com/business/367908-western-corporations-invest-russia-billions/

It was also just announced that Chinese companies are going to invest US$3 billion in the Russian Far East:
https://www.rt.com/business/367619-china-businesses-investments-russia/

This will only get better as Trump becomes president in January 2017 and ties between USA and Russia may mend themselves to pre-Cold War levels. 

This is going to be a dramatic change to geopolitics and the Russian economy. The Russian economy (ranked 12th) is smaller than the South Korean economy (ranked 11th) by GDP nominal value. However, realistically speaking, it should be at least the world's No.5 economy, just by its population size, land size and natural resources alone. 

An ETF returning &gt;50% is uncommon and I don't see this bull run in Russian ETFs stopping any time soon unless Trump gets impeached or Putin does something stupid in the Middle East and there's WW3 (this wont happen). 

There are so many western companies buying into Russia now, it's crazy. 

The Russian economy has been shrinking for 2 straight years and is now returning to growth from 2017 onwards. And better US-Russia relations will 100% definitely boost the Russian stock market. ",0

16-11-24,5el01x,Reducing cost basis of positions with theta positive options.,"Look, WSB is a fun place to blow off some steam and have a good time with other traders but I want to share some real advice for a minute, for some of you this is old news but I wanted to reach out to the newer traders that pop in from time to time.

If you want to build a portfolio that consistently wins over time buy into liquid stocks and sell calls against them for a premium, this will reduce your cost basis and allow you to make more money on a position than a dividend ever could.  Roll or close the  calls before your underlying get called away then rinse and repeat. 

Holding stocks that are inversely correlated lets you maintaim a market neutral position while collecting a steady premium.

On the flip side, do you want to buy AMD at 8.50 a share? Then you would love to own it at 7.50 a share. Sell the put and collect the premium, if it dips below and you get excersiced then you are still better off then if you bought it at 8.50 AND you collected the premium, once you own it sell calls until it gets called away or close the position before expiration.

Any single option position is no better than gambling on a stock but if you build a theta positive portfolio that is delta neutral you will consistantly make money. Take your winners at 50% max profit and roll or hedge your losers until they become profitable. 

Just some food for thought, I'll go back to eating Dicks and drinking bleach now.",53

Its been a year and I've got 25% of my rsu's vested and ready to sell via etrade. From what I've understood, etrade first deducts 'x' shares to pay for taxes and then shows the remaining amount as sellable. I have a few questions about this:

1. Is the remaining amount tax free? As in, if the amount shown (which I can sell) on etrade is $5000 then if I sell the entire shares will my bank account be increased by $5000?

2. What happens if the stock price goes up and I land up with $8000 in my etrade account? (From what I read this {$3000} is considered as a capital gain and ill have to pay 33% tax on that but am not sure).

3. Say the stock price was $5 initially. Etrade paid taxes on that and left me $5000 which I can sell. What happens if the stock price goes down to $3 tomorrow and my sellable amount becomes $3000? I have already paid tax when it was $5 so will I be refunded the extra tax I paid?

I've spent *a lot* of time reading BiggerPockets and various blogs. And my conclusion is RE doesn't quite align with my goals, primarily because the ""worthy gains"" only truly come with leverage/debt, which I'm strongly opposed to as personal preference. However, all-cash purchases stick in the 6-8% range.

Recently I've began learning about CEF's (like RCS). Some of these funds have rock-solid monthly dividend histories lasting 20 years at 10%+.

On top of that the only interaction I saw between their fb account and another user was a complaint.  Oh and their last post was in 2015. 

From what I have gathered, this spike and its DD seems to always lead to investorshub.com. Enough said about that. 

The pictures uploaded - the smartphone screen shot with the V can easily be photoshopped.  The other picture is is the TD Ameritrade picture posted yesterday that claimed to say the V was next to the symbol.  SPCL&amp;V was posted in the symbol SEARCH BAR! It appears to me that the uploader of that image went to the SPCL chart and then typed SPCL&amp;V in the search bar without hitting search. 

I've searched all of the Board members supposedly involved and couldn't even find them on LinkedIn excluding Leonard Caprino - although I don't have a LinkedIn account you can still search it's members.

16-11-24,5epil8,Lets talk about TTWO.,"Doesn't seem like anyone is talking about this company recently and previous posts from users on here didn't really rank them favourably, some even suggesting they were going to drop. However, TTWO has consistently done well since 2012. They've gone up 500% ($8.08 to $48.48) since 30th July 2012! 


GTA V was announced Oct 2011 and between Mar-Jul 2012 the stock plummeted around 42%. Since then the stock has grew without any real decline.

Extensively marketed and widely anticipated, in 2013 GTA V broke industry sales records and became the fastest-selling entertainment product in history, earning $800 million in its first day and $1 billion in its first three days. This doubling the expected figure by analysts. 

Rockstar have cunningly released GTA V 3 times for various platforms over the space of 19 months. This staggered release has led to the game being the 4th best selling game ever (only behind Wii sports, Minecraft &amp;amp; Tetris). Rockstar have also maintained strong post-release content, keeping the game relevant and constantly making money to this day. The game even made more sales in its 3rd year than its 2nd.

With GTA V being the poster child of what Rockstar &amp;amp; TTWO are capable of, Red Dead Redemption 2 has been recently announced and is expected to launch some time in 2017 with similar results. GTA 6 is also in the pipe line and is expected in 2018 (Although 2019 is more realistic). 

To me, TTWO seems like a no brainer if you want to make 50%+ gains per year.
Of course, Rockstar is just one part of Take Two, but they are the real money maker. 

Looking at the facts it all seems easy gains, so what am I missing r/investing?
Would I be foolish to drop the low end of 5 figures into this company or should we all be rubbing our hands? I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts.

16-11-24,5elpu6,[DD] Inter-market Analysis: Understanding JNUG,"##**TL;DR: JNUG is moved by a lot of factors. You cannot look at one single index or item to trade JNUG. See list of charts at bottom**

#I am writing this post to answer the multiple questions this sub sees on a regular basis in regards to the leveraged ETF's NUGT/JNUG &amp; DUST/JDST. 

[JNUG on Yahoo Finance for those living under a rock](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/JNUG?p=JNUG). 

#For your information **JNUG**:

&gt;The investment seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of **300% of the performance of the MVIS Global Junior Gold Miners Index**. The fund creates long positions by investing at least 80% of its assets in the securities that comprise the MVIS Global Junior Gold Miners Index and/or financial instruments that provide leveraged and unleveraged exposure to the index. It is non-diversified.

So what does that mean? **It means that whatever the symbol GDXJ does JNUG will make the same move, but it will be exaggerated**. I'm not here to tell you about how its balanced and decay and whatnot, just don't bag hold this shit. Now we need to figure out what makes GDXJ tick, because it is the underlying security moving JNUG. GDXJ is an ETF made up of gold mining companies. 

&gt;The index includes companies that generate at least 50% of their revenues from (or, in certain circumstances, have at least 50% of their assets related to) gold mining and/or silver mining/royalties/streaming or have mining projects with the potential to generate at least 50% of their revenues from gold and/or silver when developed. 

#So now we want to think about what makes gold mining companies tick. 

People change their sentiment on mining companies with a close correlation to whatever commodity the company sells. It's like oil companies and their relation to crude oil prices. Perception is often more important than what should happen. When people see gold go up, they buy gold miners even if the gold mining companies will see little to no change with minuscule movements in the commodity.

#**Everything is connected.** 

The bond market is far bigger than the stock market. [Bonds are being sold in record numbers](https://www.google.com/amp/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN13D2IP?client=safari) after the Trump election, creating a massive increase in yields. As people sell their bonds they are not sitting on their cash, the money is moving into stocks and generally riskier assets. As this happens the safe-haven value of gold is decreasing. Combine this with the record high dollar strength compared to other currencies and gold looks far less attractive as an investment in the near term. Gold still has a lot of value as an investment but in the short term it likely has further to drop before it climbs again. (That's just my personal opinion, don't crucify me if I'm wrong).

Below are a series of charts to compare different asset classes with gold. 

First of all: 

 - GDXJ versus Gold
  - https://www.tradingview.com/x/m7Q0GOWE/
   - Basically a direct relationship, even with small shifts in the price of gold causing movement in GDXJ.

Next, asset relations to Gold:

 - Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) versus Gold
  - https://www.tradingview.com/x/XtYn9kuz/

 - 30-yr treasury yield versus Gold 
  - https://www.tradingview.com/x/EsUvaH2b/
   - Inversely related. Bond yields go up when their prices go down, so as people sell their bonds and flood the market yields go up and gold goes down.

 - Treasury Bond Futures Index versus Gold
  - https://www.tradingview.com/x/Q5PqHf92/

 - Crude Oil futures versus Gold
  - https://www.tradingview.com/x/YgVNOduz/

 - S&amp;P500 versus Gold
  - https://www.tradingview.com/x/mRp8PhlP/

 - US Dollar index versus Gold
  - https://www.tradingview.com/x/iMI96qjA/

 - VIX Volatility Index versus Gold
  - https://www.tradingview.com/x/lvhFZP0Z/

##**Now what happened over the last few weeks that drove gold to this dramatic plunge?**

Lets see another chart. 

 - https://www.tradingview.com/x/PdgxQb0j/ 

The red box is immediately after the election, see how immediately after we have a massive selloff in bonds? (Price inverse to yield, chart shows yield shooting up). With Trump winning the election the market became extremely bullish on future economic output and the general business environment. Whether this is warranted or not is not the point, the point is that it is the current market sentiment. Think opposite Brexit. Brexit was a flight to safety (gold shot up immediately) so it stands to reason that gold has plummeted in the election aftermath.

#In summation: Trump victory kicked off surge in bullish sentiment and expectations of future economic growth, which helped spur a massive selloff in bonds, which helped drive the dollar higher and funneled money into other asset classes, next thing you know gold is down and JNUG is fucked.

As I come across any helpful reading I'll paste them down here.

&gt;I think you should add a section about premiums and discounts and how a market maker/authorized participant makes sure these ETF's stay closer to the NAV. And how at certain points people can lose more then they thought because they bought at a premium. Although with the liquity of JNUG its almost nill. Still, some people think other factors like demand have large affect in ETF's

 - The transaction prices for shares are based on current market supply and demand and may be higher (premium) or lower (discount) than the net asset value per share of the fund.
  - As such, shareholders may pay more than net asset value when purchasing fund shares and receive less than net asset value when redeeming those shares.",125

In here we discuss the events that will cause the crash, the effect of the crash and how to profit from it. It may happen sooner than thought

&amp;nbsp;

1. **Italy Referendum Vote**

 Vote: **December 4th**.

 **Matteo Renzi** will resign if the vote is a **""NO""**. 

 If **Renzi** were to resign, that could in turn bolster support for Italy's right-wing populist party, the **Five Star Movement**, which is headed by former comedian **Beppe Grillo**. The Five Star Movement has agitated for Italy to **leave the euro zone**. Such an outcome may seem like a long shot, but at this point investors and others around the world are slower to dismiss such wild-card events out of hand.

2. **Italy's ""non-performing loans"" Bank crisis and European Banks in general**

 ""In the Italian system, the banks say they are worth 45-50 cents in the dollar. But the bid price is 20 cents. If they were to mark them down, they would be insolvent.""

 In short: ***If many European banks admitted the true value of their loans, they'd go under, potentially sparking a new financial crisis.*** --The Big Short investor, Steve Eisman

3. **France Election**

 Election: **23 April 2017**

 **Le Pen**, leader of the Front national (FN), is the female **Donald Trump** of France. She wants closed border, anti-globalization and **leave the EU**. Le Pen wants to follow Britain in quitting the EU altogether to reassert national control over the economy, Fillon has no such ambitions. He is a candidate for **globalization** and **austerity**, the very program that has become a totemic ***hate symbol driving the populist mood for revolt.***

 **If she wins and France leaves the E.U.**
 #*GAME OVER*

 She might have a good chance of winning because of the momentum of Brexit and Donald Trump. **The silent majority might strike again.**

16-11-24,5em82k,"For those who take the view that a recession and/or market crash is likely to happen in the near term (within nxt yr), what do you expect to cause the ""shock"" that results in the recession/crash?","People often forget that recessions and market crashes usually only happen when there's some sort of economic ""shock"".  In the most recent crisis, you had the housing market and toxic securitized products, the early 2000s had the popping of the tech/telecom bubble, and oil price shocks contributed to recessions in the 70s and early 90s.

Currently, it seems to me that there are actually more bright spots in the economy that would make it even more difficult to tip the economy into a recession. The consumer is in better shape then it's been in in a long time, manufacturing, which has been a weak spot, looks to be improving, housing continues to be pretty strong.  

People thought the fall out from the drop in energy prices could be the trigger, but the economy held up. 

The Fed has been super sensitive to the reactions of the market. Interest rate increases are likely come at a very gradual pace, in my opinion. 

So, my question is, what's going to cause the ""shock"" that drives a near term crash?",10
16-11-24,5em8ak,Crackpot JNUG/DUST question,"I know someone on this sub has done this. What's rhe most someone's made/lost shorting one and buying the other on the same day? It looks like roulette to me. If you guess right you'd make a killing! Who's done it and what fantastic prizes did you win??",1
16-11-24,5em8nv,What is up with the dollar vs treasuries ?,"The way I don't understand Trump is this. Either he's going to print boatloads of money, or he's not. Let's analyse each situation:

1) boatloads of money print + infrastructure spending with massive hiring

Immediate consequences would be a drop in the dollar, medium term inflation and employment would improve. Also this ought to provide investment opportunities for the big banks who would be able to deploy capital at higher interest rates. Mortgage rates should go up and so should treasuries. Combined with a Fed hike this should lead to far higher borrowing costs for governments around the globe who are already borrowing to pay interest and have mostly been saving money for the past decade or so. So this should lead to Euro printing, Yen printing, ... so medium term you'd expect things to get back into equilibrium and the dollar should rise again, but to a different level.

2) (he has to get spending approved in the Senate/Congress after all) no money printing/infrastructure spending

Given the FED's rhetoric the interest rate would still rise, but far more modestly. The dollar would rise, because it's slowly on it's way to become a high-yielding currency again (or at least that'll be the going theory until the next crisis, just like in 2005). This should result in a rise in the dollar. We would however remain stuck in our slow secular drain-circling ""where the fuck did demand for X go ?"" loop. Governments would continue on their current path of slowly making things worse for ever more citizens with austerity, but nothing has to change until the pension crashes actually start happening, which won't be until 2019-2020, maybe even 2030, at which point they'll still be forced to print money.

I would like to add option 3:

3) The market suddenly throws a tantrum and after the SPX drops 30% the FED, with the donald's agreement resumes QE in earnest, but of course without infrastructure spending because at this point congress and the senate block any large debt increases in the government, and they're pretty upset at having to approve the next round of QE ""or face certain doom"" (again). Dollar drops back to previous levels against the Euro/other currencies.

Now Trump has promised to implement options 1 and 2 both. Obviously both happening together is out of the question. Given his appointment of Steve Bannon and what Mr. Bannon has posted when not in a hateful drunk stupor, e.g. [1], one would assume that (1) is the current plan.

But the market seems to believe that (1) and (2) will happen at the same time, and has pretty much fully discounted (3) (I'd put it on, perhaps 10% odds of happening) :

Spectacular dollar rally

Rally in short term interest rates, including treasury interest rates

Rally in bank stocks (a rally starting from the lowest level these banks have been at for a long time)

So markets seem to predict massive government spending, serious rise in inflation and no extra government debt at all, ie. a serious reduction in government spending. Does anyone know why were seeing these things at the same time ? Are we really in a situation where significant parts of the market believe Mr. Trump is a magician, unbound by economic realities that affect everyone else ? To me, this doesn't make sense.

That would mean, if you take Trump at his word, a lot of money can be made betting against the dollar. If you assume he's lying or he's incompetent (both distinct possibilities), a lot of money can be made betting this latest financials rally will come off the rails, a bet which would pay off even better if (3) does come to pass, even temporarily.

Rather another rate my portfolio post I thought a rate my watch list question would be more interesting since it contains those wild hair ideas you would most likely never buy, and more useful to me, since if I already own it I'm stuck with it. I would rather be told not to buy a lemon than be told I own one. The former I can correct. My watch list has 77 entries so I have to break it up by some metric and I chose yield as I am an opportunistic trader that primarily dividend growth mid to large cap US companies. With a few wild hairs. Please bear with me if this formatting turns out poorly . So here we go with the 8 companies currently yielding less than 2% and a bit of comment why they are on the list.

RTN-N Raytheon Co. 1.98%yld High techie techie.

MKC-N McCormick &amp; Co. 1.89%yld Pretty bland for a spice company.

LECO-Q Lincoln Electric 1.82%yld Welding. Infrastructury.

CVGW-Q Calavo Growers 1.61%yld Acocados, you always knew some fucker was making bank as middleman for those things.

SJW-N San Jose Water 1.52%yld Water, need that shit to grow those aforementioned avocados.

BHP-N BHP Billiton 1.45%yld, maybe, for now. Mole people, shoveling rusty dirt into ships to be sent away only to return as more digging machines for the mole people. Odd business frankly, I have it on the list as a benchmark not a potential investment. It is good to keep an eye on those mole people.

LMNR-Q	Limoneira Co. 1.01%yld Connected somehow to the avocado company CVGW. They do lemons.

TCK-N Teck Resources 0.29%yld More mole people.

Looking back that is quite a diversified list. Hope to hear some opinions on these picks and if it generates any interest aside the snide and the downvotes I will carry on up the yield ladder of the remaining 69 on my watch list this weekend.

16-11-24,5eneum,What is the best way to fund a start-up?,"Hey there,

We are a group of industry professionals in game development with 7 to 11 years experience. We decided to take a step back and use our savings and experience to try to establish a little studio, in order to create commercial games. We are not the average indie amateur enthusiasts and we have a broad range of skills and networking in order to create a product, not the usual indie game experience.

This being said, now we are researching all sorts of ways on how to get funding for our ambition and initiative.We are looking into national EU funds and grants and we are constantly trying to see if we can get up a Kickstarter with what we have.

We talked with various investment companies from Europe, France, Finland, Germany and all of them require the following conditions:
- have crossed the seed phase
- have revenues with four zeros
- and have a relevant portfolio of ""existing clients"" which does not apply to our line of work

• We can cross the seed phase using our savings and establish a corporate entity, which we are planning right now.

• Obviously we can't have revenues of four zeros right now, and most probably will not have in the next year and a half until our next product will be completed.

• We do not have ""existing clients"" because we don't do outsourcing and we don't plan to. Our portfolio consists of our experience and titles shipped with AAA companies in the industry.

• We do not want to go into loans and credit-card line of credit because we do not have a constant revenue to pay that

• We would like to negotiate some sort of advance from a strategic partner, but for now it seems just like a fantasy

•  We are looking into government grants and funds for small businesses but it's rather impossible to get one, even with a strong business plan in our country. The government here does not believe in IT and Game Industry.


That being said we all heard stories with venture capitalists, angel-investors etc. 
As you may observe, we do not have the proper vocabulary, nor the knowledge to identify where to start and how we can start this up, beside knocking at all doors and fail, because we do not meet the ""conditions"".

It just feels that we are at a job interview, where they require money, so we can get money. Lots of money. How can we get experience if we don't have the chance of getting experience?
Maybe it's not the best comparison, but this is how this subject constantly hits and discourages us. What is making us keep going is our ambition to create our own unique experiences, while having independence. We are all convinced that we do not want to go back into the toxic behemoths of the industry where we are underpaid and our creative ambitions are constantly stepped on, by the usual oblivious ""managers"" and ""leaders"".

We would like to know your opinions, and how you guys are seeing things. Where should we start and how? 
Is it a fantasy to find funding to start-up our studio without a four zero capital and a constant revenue?
Is it something that we should stop pursuing and start doing more work-for-hire until we have more savings?

Thanks in advance

I wanted to have a discussion around TFSA investing, specifically with ETF's. With ETF's gaining so much popularity in recent years, do you guyz think its overrated? From my research (not extensive), I find that they are better then mutual funds and do better in the long run. Do you believe the same to be true? If you do, share you favorites ets? - if you have any right now.. If not, What are the major flaws? Or why haven't you considered this?
 
Here are some of the things I hold in my TFSA: FIE, XST, ZUT, ZQQ, VEE. I don't hold significant amounts of anything (exception to FIE as I m 22 and don't have a lot of money but trying to save for sure. 

more recently, I have started learning/ come across information regarding leveraged etf's. What are your thoughts on that? considering their risk/reward factor do you/ or would hold it in your TFSA?

16-11-25,5er9ua,What kind of valuations/multiples do you see the LPs getting for Canadian Recreational Marijuana legalization?,"So most of us can price out the approximate gross revenues of the recreational market; from there, pricing out where the LPs/growers will be valued is a further equation of net margins/market shares/capex/etc (standard valuation metrics). Now, for the two scenarios I see playing out for the Canadian Marijuana Industry, one lends itself to higher multiples while the other leads to lower multiples.  
  
I see lower valuations/multiples coming from a loosely regulated market. With bulk retail sales you will just buy strain X from a jar and pay whatever the price it is; i see no differentiation of brand in this scenario and since all of these companies have the potential to grow all the same strains, commoditization of price should occur. In this scenario the low-cost producers benefit the most, and then the industry valuations will be lower because margins will be squeezed and net margins will end up at lower levels; less net revenue/commodity pricing leads to lower multiples, less differentiation of product.  
  
But, I do believe the most probable scenario with higher valuations/multiples will come from a highly regulated climate, with prepackaged goods and regulated pricing; this will relieve some downward pressure on pricing that would come from commodity pricing of bulk goods. If prepackaged goods are mandatory as well, then branding will play a large part in retail sales. Branding means people will pick your product over competitors, so you have better pricing power and market share (better pricing power = better margins, higher market share = higher revenue). In this case, I see potential for companies capturing higher market shares (due to branding) and I see higher net margins due to more pricing power; due to these factors, I see higher potential valuations/multiples.  
  
Not to mention the probable higher multiples due to being an eternal, defensive industry (a lot of famous investors talk about the best investments being the ones you can forget about for 100 years, ill argue Marijuana being one of the more eternal industries). Lower CAPEX required to run the business (Which means margin protection). With the industry being brand new, ill argue that 20 years of recreational sales being the norm will be a huge factor in eliminating negative stigmas associated with marijuana; this should increase consumption and gross revenues. Highly regulated climate also means potential barriers of entry for LPs and could mean all sales going through very few establishments (provincially owned), so you know your brand will be in every store.    
  
Im rambling, but does anyone else see how a highly regulated marijuana retail climate could lead to potentially high multiples/valuations when it comes to the LPs/Growers? Occam's Razor dictates that we see a highly regulated climate with provincially controlled stores and prepackaged products; I see this being the perfect storm for LPs to capture higher market shares/net margins. From a security analysis standpoint, I see plenty of catalysts for higher valuations/net multiples; also see plenty of margin of safety as well (even if they only do medicinal sales).",7

But with the world ever so slowly moving towards clean energy, clean health, and reversing the damage we've done, is there a brand-named company who is successfully mass-producing such air filtration systems? I can see this becoming hugely popular in the near future -- in home units, outdoor units next to smoking areas, massive ones on top of sky scrapers, etc. Air quality in some cities are absolutely terrible. This will become a thing, but looking for the company that will corner this market.

For marijuana, my hopes are set on BLOZF, which is a company making breathalyzers for weed. I imagine that will end up being used within the next year or two, so it should end up paying off. Another is MSRT, ""MassRoots"", an app that is basically like an Instagram for stoners and also helps people locate dispensaries as well as rate different strains. Apparently they just got a contract with Aphria, a big name in the industry, so I imagine it will expand. Another random is one my dad got me to invest in, called WRN, Western Gold and Copper. They've been drilling into a mine in Canada for what feels like forever now, but they are finally starting to take off. I recommend looking into these companies. 

One I wanted to see if anyone knows about is CPRX. It's a medical company, no marijuana involved. Another my dad told me about a while back, I've mostly lost money on it, but I'm still wondering if it has any hope. Let me know what you think. Thanks!

If I understand it correctly, they are simply entering into an agreement where they can sell (dilute) common stock. The odd thing is, there has been a lot of insider buying this week.

Members of the board of directors, as well as the CEO all filed Form 4 this week.

With all the buying, I felt like something was in the works. It seems odd that they would all buy stock right before a dilution, and Yuval Cohen (CEO) has stated recently and publicly that they have enough cash runway to last through 2017. So a dilution now would seem out of place. The form doesn't indicate that they will dilute, simply that they can.

EDIT: Might aswell paste it up here also, but a quick bit of research into the industry as a whole and the main players...

I will agree that P/E of 44 is high, however, let's take a look at the industry as a whole.

https://www.statista.com/statistics/257677/global-market-share-of-the-leading-beer-companies-based-on-sales/

We see here $BUD has roughly 30% of the market (recently a merger has occurred with the two main players SAB and Inbev), and is a clear leader in the industry.

Lets take a look at the main competitors...

Heineken- Market Share 9% : P/E 30.75

Carlsberg - Market Share 6% : Cannot Find P/E

China Resources Beer Holdings - Market Share 6% : P/E 41

Molson Coors Brewery - Market Share 3%: P/E 30

Based on these results, I actually see the P/E as a fair valuation and a good opportunity.
However, this DD was very quick in nature so if you have any rebuttals to this information I would be happy to hear it.

# Description

They've a pretty clear description of themselves in the annual report!

&gt; We are a global digital industrial company, transforming industry with software-defined machines and solutions that are connected, responsive and predictive. With products and services ranging from aircraft engines, power generation and oil and gas production equipment to medical imaging, financing and industrial products, we serve customers in approximately 180 countries and employ approximately 333,000 people worldwide. Since our incorporation in 1892, we have developed or acquired new technologies and services that have considerably broadened and changed the scope of our activities.

Of course, one thing they aren't really highlighting is that they got themselves into a whole mess with their GE Capital arm. At one stage the venerable industrial business felt like its finance arm was here the real action was. But it came to an end with the Great Recession and in early 2015 they decided to largely get our of finance.

## Recent financials 

Here are the figures for the last 5 years, though it's not that informative, other than showing that the GE Capital business caused a major headache in 2015!

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $117bn | $117bn | $113bn | $113bn | $110bn|
|EPS | $0.17 | $0.94 | $0.74 | $0.82 | $0.76|
|DPS | $0.92 | $0.89 | $0.79 | $0.70 | $0.61|


Though the headline figures don't give a really good picture. Here's what the Industrial only unit looks like, though this is their ""Adjusted EPS"".

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $109bn | $110bn | $103bn | $103bn | $95bn|
|EPS | $1.31 | $1.12 | $1.00 | N/A | N/A|

If we look at that $109bn and the 8 major divisions, actually 4 division are 75% of it with 4 making up 25%. The main divisions are Aviation, Power, Healthcare, Oil &amp; Gas. And you may have seen the recent announcement that they are merging their Oil &amp; Gas into Baker Hughes. 

As for 2016...

&gt;  Industrial revenues increased $7.2 billion, or 9%, mainly from the effects of acquisitions of $9.3 billion, primarily Alstom.

And earnings have done really well too, though flattered by the comparison with an ugly 2015!

## The exit from GE Capital

So the GE Capital fiasco is nearing it's end. 

* They've pulling in the financing arms for Aviation, Industrial &amp; Healthcare Equipment and Oil &amp; Gas. 
* They've demerged the retail business, called Synchrony Financial. 
* Reduced their asset base of GE Capital to $203bn from $501bn
* And in all the restructuring been able to buy back $20 billion of stock.

Now...there have been charges and losses on the unwind, but the original estimate of a $23 billion hit to profits, has been stable. And may even be reined in.

## Competition

When you've got 8 *major* divisions all generating billions of sales on a global basis, it's a bit meaningless to have a shortlist of key competitors. Especially if you are junking a whole troubled division.

A straight comparison with Buffett, J&amp;J or even IBM isn't too informative, as they aren't really ""industrial conglomerates""! Instead UTX or Siemens is probably a better match. At 12% margins it's below their levels, but their margin is hurt by the GE Capital business. If we look at the ""Industrial"" unit only the margin was a healthy 15%.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
General Electric Company | $115,258M | 12% | 10%
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. | $217,751M | 21% | 9%
Johnson &amp; Johnson | $71,595M | 33% | 22%
International Business Machines Corp. | $80,207M | 21% | 78%
United Technologies Corporation | $56,885M | 16% | 13%
Honeywell International Inc. | $39,299M | 22% | 27%
Siemens AG (ADR) | $84,040M | 13% | 15%
ABB Ltd (ADR) | $34,077M | 14% | 12%
Koninklijke Philips NV (ADR) | $25,716M | 11% | 3%

## Cash / Debt?

General Electric Company has $96,908M of net debt. That is 7x it's latest operating profit. Scary on the face of it. Take Ford as an example of a bank + company :) It's on 9x operating profit.

But this isn't a great way to look at it, as it's still part a financial services company part an industrial conglomerate. On the total $150bn of debts, $100bn are inside the Finance arm...and banks tend to live by very different leverage levels than regular companies!

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $32.46 for General Electric Company and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 4% to their target.

# Valuation

4% upside and a Buy? Seems a little silly. Especially when it's on 21x earnings. 

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/ge/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
GE | $277,246M | 21x | 12% | 3% | 8%
BRKA | $388,789M | 22x | N/A | 0% | 9%
JNJ | $307,611M | 17x | 7% | 3% | 9%
IBM | $154,019M | 12x | 3% | 3% | 14%
UTX | $89,018M | 16x | 7% | 2% | 9%
HON | $86,753M | 17x | 9% | 2% | 9%
SIEGY.PK | $96,194M | 14x | 7% | 4% | 9%
ABB | $45,437M |  17x | 9% | 4% | 10%
PHG | $27,653M | 18x | 22% | 3% | 9%

In fact it's confusing to see the high valuation relative to UTX or Siemens. Why? I don't see the logic. 

If the idea that like Berkshire there is substantial value in the non-core assets? That once they are stripped out the adjusted PE is a lot lower?

# Dividends

General Electric Company is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.94 per share, compared to a forecast EPS of $1.49.

And on top of the regular dividend ,they are keen to create more value by disposals of remaining GE Capital units and return that cash to shareholders.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 0% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -1%. Though the stock is up 10% in the last month, following the 3Q results and Baker Hughes deal.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers they refused to give guidance for 2017, but did say:

&gt; We'll give you our 2017 outlook in December but all of our metrics for compensation purposes will continue to be linked to $2 of EPS in 2018 are aligned with investors.

Buy how much would you pay for $2 of GE earnings? Is 15x today's price not fair?

Is there some hidden value in the portfolio? Some ""investments"". A windfall from GE Capital? If there is, then I get the valuation. But if not, I'm left scratching my head.

Okay, it's a quality stock, a great deal maker, constantly adjusting its portfolio. But it's hardly a bargain, in the way BRKB is when you take account of its investments.

16-11-25,5ev7n7,Rational Decision-Making under Uncertainty: Observed Betting Patterns on a Biased Coin,"The study is [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2856963). The abstract is below. Keep in mind that the subjects here were students and professionals in finance and economics, including 14 associates at ""leading asset management firms.""

&gt; What would you do if you were invited to play a game where you were given $25 and allowed to place bets for 30 minutes on a coin that you were told was biased to come up heads 60% of the time? This is exactly what we did, gathering 61 young, quantitatively trained men and women to play this game. The results, in a nutshell, were that the majority of these 61 players didn’t place their bets very well, displaying a broad panoply of behaviorial and cognitive biases. About 30% of the subjects actually went bust, losing their full $25 stake. We also discuss optimal betting strategies, valuation of the opportunity to play the game and its similarities to investing in the stock market. 

&gt; The main implication of our study is that people need to be better educated and trained in how to approach decision making under uncertainty. If these quantitatively trained players, playing the simplest game we can think of involving uncertainty and favourable odds, didn’t play well, what hope is there for the rest of us when it comes to playing the biggest and most important game of all: investing our savings? In the words of Ed Thorp, who gave us helpful feedback on our research: ‘This is a great experiment for many reasons. It ought to become part of the basic education of anyone interested in finance or gambling.’",9

Anyone know the economic implications if more people continue to default? Full disclosure, I just watched The Big Short four times in a row, so now I'm looking for value wherever it can be found. 

My thoughts, I actually predict deflation. People have flat incomes but stocks, houses, and other assets continue to rise in value. Since young people aren't spending their own money, only borrowed money, it will start reducing spending power.  And the only people with non-borrowed money are dumping it into assets, not really consuming/boosting the economy with it (just the underlying asset values). I think this lack of purchasing power will eventually lead to asset values dropping. We have an entire generation entering the economy with no way to really purchase, their future money is already in the current economy (as debt), meaning the current economy is inflated and can't be sustained.

Mr. Gross is quite pessimistic on the outlook, suggesting that lower corporate taxes and heavy government spending will end up not in the hands of middle America but rather go toward propping up the markets and driving prices higher - which will eventually backfire, lowering GDP growth and quickly driving the country into an inflation-fueled recession. 

Mr. Dalio, in contrast, suggests that the Trump picks so far seem to have a good understanding of how to walk the fine economic line and ""probably won't recklessly and stupidly drive the economy into a ditch"". From an economic standpoint, he says, this major shift from increased globalization, free trade, and weak fiscal policy to decreased globalization, decreased free trade, and aggressive fiscal policy will drive up interest rates, increase dollar prices, and spur domestic growth. In the markets, this means that bond prices **decrease** and stock prices and the dollar **increase**. 


From an economic standpoint, these are basically two sides to the same idea: The presidency will either be good on timing and this growth period will be appropriately managed, or aggressiveness will breed that stupidity (that Dalio thinks will be avoided) and end up reversing any good it has caused, driving the country fairly quickly (i.e., 1-2 quarters into the presidency) into a recession.

16-11-26,5ewqre,why passive index investors should have some gold in their portfolio,"First, disclosure: I'm not a gold bug and I'm not arguing for anything other than that you should have ~5% of your portfolio in gold and/or silver. I'm also not a passive index investor. I'm writing this because I think market dynamics are philosophically interesting. I hope to show the open-minded of you how your thinking on gold is irrational and not consistent with your other beliefs.

The following are **premises** I'll use in my argument (not calling them facts, so don't argue them, the argument is the same regardless, I'm just setting up some context):

1) You can't time a market.
2) The S&amp;P 500 is a financial asset worth about $20 trillion in total.
3) Gold is financial asset worth about $7 trillion in total.
4) The total returns have been about the same for the period of the last 10 years and the last 20 years. (Picking one decade and two decade periods ending in today because I don't want to be accused of cherry picking. Again, I'm not debating this, you'll see in the argument below it doesn't really matter what the actual comparative performance has been, I just want to point out the comparable returns since so many people on here either seem not to know it or believe it).

Now the **argument**:

You're a passive index investor who doesn't try to ""time the market"" or pick individual stocks because you either have no interest in doing so or believe it would not be worth your time or believe you would not be successful. That is a perfectly reasonable belief since market prices are determined by those who are more active and have more capital, knowledge, and intelligence than you.

Now, my question is, why do you only apply this to the stock market? Saying you can't ""time the market"" is logically equivalent to saying you are unwillingly or unable to determine the current price.  Because after you have ""the correct price"", it's very easy, if it's higher than the market, you sell, if it's lower, you buy. The hard part is determining that price (outside the scope of this discussion!). There are only a finite amount of dollars out there and the stock market is only one choice out of many so yes, it has a relative price to all other asset classes (I mean, that's the very definition of price). Not everyone just blindly buys one asset class like you at any price.

So, price, price, price. That's all that matters. Price is why First Majestic Silver is a good long at $2 at the start of the year and a good short at $19 only six months later. And that's why I find it annoying when people who say they can't price the S&amp;P 500 will be the same people to tell you never to buy gold because historically it has worse returns and the kicker is they'll tell you everyone knows this. Yes, you're right, the market knows this and it has been factored into the price (as a discount). Is 1 cent an ounce too low? Probably. Is $1m an once too high? Probably. Do you not have to worry about it because someone else more qualified than you (Mr. Market, himself) will set a reasonable price for gold based on all factors historical, current, and future just as he does for the S&amp;P 500? Yes. Is the future uncertain so it's important to have as many different types of assets as possible in the interest of preserving wealth through whatever weather? Yes. If you eschew gold, are you only hurting yourself by having a less diversified, robust portfolio? Yes!

That's it, except for one last thing. I want to address those of you who say they wouldn't even pay 1 cent per ounce for gold.  If you've been paying attention you'll notice the argument above is nothing specific to gold. It's what should be the obvious argument that the market will assign an appropriate price to all different asset classes based on risk and expectation of future returns and that you don't need to worry about it (just to be clear, I'm speaking from the voice of the passive index investor. I actually don't believe any of that).  All you need to do is diversify into all of them in differing amounts based on the amount of risk you want to take on. Eschewing any particular asset is illogical. Back to the ""gold is completely worthless"" folks. For you, I believe that is true just as for me professional sports are completely worthless. If everyone was like you, you're right, gold would be worth nothing. And if everyone was like me, professional athletes wouldn't be paid millions, it wouldn't even be an occupation. Now does that mean I think the Dallas Cowboys football club is worth $0? Of course, not. I'm aware the value of something to me is not the same as the value to all of us collectively. And it's only the latter than is of any importance.

I lied, one more thing. Too often people make an appeal to authority. Don't fall into that trap. Just because superstar so and so says gold is a waste of space doesn't mean anything. People change their minds as well. Put your trust in reason, not humans.

tldr; passive index investors who can't ""time the market"", i.e. determine price, but will tell you the exact price ($0) of entire other financial asset classes (i.e. gold) should just shut up. The market is smarter than you, has considered all things, and you're only job is to diversify according to desired risk (is that not your credo?)

16-11-26,5ext1v,Better investment ... Twitter or Atlassian?,"What is the better investment?

**Twitter** or **Atlassian**?

Short term or long term?

Short term, there is the potential for huge profits with the right play on **TWTR** if they are acquired by the likes of Disney or someone else.

There is also the risk of any or all acquisition rumors being shot down, which could result in the stock tanking; maybe even towards a sub-$10 per share pricing.

As far as **TEAM** is concerned, I don't see much gain in the short term.  However, from a long term perspective, this stock can take a slow and steady climb towards $50 over the next two to three years.

Atlassian is a great company and, though there hasn't been any talk of an acquisition, it wouldn't surprise me if someone like Salesforce, Google, or Microsoft made a play for them.  IMO, Atlassian is the safer play (both short term and long term).

So, what do you think?",3

At the moment I am looking to learn how to optimize a stock screener and better understand different variables and parameters I should be searching for. I am currently using the Capital One search tool and have recently come across FinViz.

So I wanted to ask about the variables and parameters you guys may use in your screening processes.

What search criteria would have resulted in CLF on Nov. 1st or 2nd before its break? At this point the RSI had higher highs and the MACD was showing an uptrend, volume at a high, all suggesting a good buy as proven by the peak.

Since I'm curious, I figured I'd ask what some of your favorite ones are and why you've found them particularly helpful. 

I don't really have anything to plug because most of what I do is my own Excel work, which I admit opens me up to my own flaws. So I'm hoping to generate some discussion to fix that.

One thing I'm looking for is either a calculator or spreadsheet that lets you adjust the amount you contribute annually to your portfolio.  Almost everything I've found online makes you fix the number for a period of years (i.e., I contribute 50k every year for 10 years). A way where I can take into account things like a bigger bonus, or buying a car, etc. would be useful; basically, something that gets more specific (i.e. 50k in year 1, 65k in year 2, 40k in year 3, you get the idea), but still accounts for interest and let's me adjust for losses/gains year over year (or month over month if you've seen that). 

Thanks in advance for any tips!",1

16-11-28,5fanhv,"Convince me that it's possible to beat the market with technical analysis","I'm a fundamentals guy and I'm convinced that you can beat the market if you're better at doing fundamental analysis and better able to manage your biases compared to others in the market.  But, I just can't see how a regular individual investor could beat the market with technical analysis. 

Technical traders/investors have to compete with enormous quant shops that build algorithms to identify and exploit any opportunities based on trading patterns of a stock, and they can do this the instant any pattern develops, before the individual even sees the updated quote. How could there ever be value left over for an individual technical analyst?

I'll point out that under all forms of the efficient market hypothesis, you can't expect to beat the market with technical analysis. (http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042715/why-does-efficient-market-hypothesis-state-technical-analysis-bunk.asp)

I don't believe in the efficient market hypothesis because, in my opinion, the assumption that all market participants are rationale is crazy.  I think that you can beat the market as a fundamental analyst because all of your competitors are subject to biases that cause them not to be rational.  Maybe there are biases introduced by the quant shops that people can take advantage of, but I'm just seeing how it could be possible. I'm open-minded and willing to change my mind if a strong case is made.

16-11-27,5f6hfr,Questions on a leveraged portfolio using futures,"I figured these questions goes beyond the scope of the daily advice thread. Nonetheless a brief introduction to give you an idea of my personal situation.

I'm based in Europe, mid-twenties, solid employment which allows me to save €2,000 ($2,100) a month. I am specialized in a niche of financial securities regulation, and I work with a firm that whose profit increases almost in lockstep with the VIX. 

In terms of financial matters I am flexible. No kids. Intend on moving in together in a year in an apartment that is well below what our combined incomes can shoulder.* My prospective plus one has a decent job that also allows her to save a decent amount. 

Since it is highly unlikely that I will be out of a job whenever the market takes a nosedive, I feel that I can use a modest amount of leverage. My current balance is €50,000 (20% bonds, 80% equity), no debts. 

My idea is to liquidate my equities, and instead buy two FESX futures contracts. The combined value of these is roughly €60,000. This would put my leverage ratio at 1.2. I do have some questions on how to execute this in practice:

1. I would invest most of the €50,000 in US bonds. What is the typical cash buffer I should be holding (in excess of the initial+maintenance margin) for these futures?

2. Which US bonds are a sensible choice for the cash? 3-5 yrs, 5-7 yrs, or even 7-10 yrs? I am somewhat stuck making sense out of this. I can add €2,000/month to my brokerage, so I can stomach some volatility in my bond holdings. 

3. Assuming future growth, my leverage ratio would decrease. What strategies can be used to determine when to add or sell an (extra) contract. Any pointers in this direction? It is not per se my goal to maintain a constant 1.2 leverage ratio. In prolonged bull markets (like, right now.) I rather be modest, while I would not mind going to (say) 1.5 when stocks are low by historical standards. (I could, for instance, use the Shiller P/E to determine my desired leverage ratio). 

Any replies appreciated. ",21

16-11-28,5fcj8f,Some quick TA on $GDX,"Since most you love sucking the sweet tit of NUGT/DUST, but probably have no idea what even moves it, I present to you a quick look at what I'm seeing in it's underlying, [$GDX](http://imgur.com/a/rxFEq). 

I dropped that dotted line once it hit the low of it's downward channel to see if it behaves similar to when it happened the previous 2 times (solid blue lines). As of today, it looks to be confirming this trend. I would keep an eye on how GDX respects this channel in the coming weeks. A breakout above the upper bounds of the channel will likely put NUGT in to orbit, but a break below the blue intermediate trendline will likely be quick and big around mid Dec. as it did previously. Just something to hopefully help y'all decide which direction you want to lean, but I will never stand in the way of anyone just throwing money blindly. 

Edit: just realized the slope on that bottom dotted line is a bit off somehow, but you should get the general idea. I'll keep updating this chart as more things become clear. 

Also I just realized that if this pattern holds true, the timing will coincide with the next fed meeting on 12/14. So I predict a slow rise to around $23 at that time, followed by a sharp drop to around $19 after Fed announcement.",4

Not exactly promising, to put it lightly. It was supposed to have gone public already.

Again, this is not a company that owns anything. 

""Innovative Industrial is a newly formed REIT that currently does not own any properties. Innovative Industrial intends to use the proceeds of the IPO to purchase several properties. One property already has a signed purchase agreement for $30 million, and 5 other properties are under two separate non-binding letters of intent and in negotiations. Obviously, this is an area of concern and uncertainty for any potential investors.

The REIT is led by a REIT veteran, Alan D. Gold, who co-founded two public REITs: BioMed Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE:BMR) and Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (NYSE:ARE).""

16-11-28,5fcsv3,The Under Armour Trade,"&gt; Other companies with similar share structures don’t suffer from the same problem. For Google-parent Alphabet, which also has nonvoting shares, regular voting shares and supervoting shares, nonvoting shares trade at a discount of only 2% to regular voting shares. That slim margin is reasonable because Alphabet founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin control 52.5% of voting power between the two of them through their supervoting shares. The spread is wider at  Viacom, which has just voting and nonvoting shares, but the nonvoting discount has remained relatively steady over time.

The more I investigated it the more it seems like a Ponzi scheme. The owners have received millions in distributions on their equity that has been mostly funded by the sale of their subordinate notes. The founder and majority shareholder also gets a 20% dividend on preferred equity that only he owns. As well as a salary. Aspirity has been bleeding money and their latest 10-Q shows a significant equity deficit. 

I'm kind of convinced that this whole business is a scam that has no intent on paying back the loans just shuffling money to the owners and will allow the company to explode in the next couple of years. They recently upped the interest rates on the notes, which to me implies they are getting desperate. 

Does anyone have a take on this that it is not a scam? (By scam i mean little to no chance of getting the money back even if its not illegal) I'm really interested to see if my logic is completely flawed. 

If you agree its a scam is there anything that could be done about it? Should this be reported to SEC? Or you think any media company would be willing to cover it?  I feel bad that there are people like my friend who might not know better are buying into this. 

Thanks

I may describe the particular program from IB but I am interested in hearing general answers not specific to any broker.


From the associated document, participation in the program allows IB to let other people borrow your shares (primarily for short-selling) and pays you a lending fee.  IB also deposits some cash collateral to your account.  You also get payments in-lieu of dividends and maintain ownership of the shares for voting purposes.  I understand that these payments in-lieu of dividends get taxed at a higher rate.


However, I'm concerned about the risks associated with the program.  The associated document mentions that the deposited collateral fulfills IB's obligation to you.
(1) Does this mean that there is a possibility that your shares never get returned to you? 
(2) Does it mean that you have to go after the other party on your own to recover your assets?


In addition to answers to these specific questions, I would appreciate any general answers about risks associated with this and similar programs.",2

Investors hope to also earn a return from increases in the market price of their shares when they are ready to sell them.

A few people came to the right conclusion that X does not need to be causal in order for it to be potentially useful in predicting returns.

A simple example shows why. Smoking causes cancer. It also causes people to huddle outside their buildings a few times during their work day. Does standing outside cause cancer? No.

But does the fact that we see someone standing outside her office building on a regular basis, change our prediction of whether she will get cancer? Yes. (For clarity you can assume that you can see them standing, but not what they are doing.)

This is no different from what all the machine learning people are doing in Silicon Valley. These engineers don't care (nor usually have a clue) about causation. They just want to make predictions. And for this purpose we don't need causation.

When would knowing a causal relationship help? It's necessary if we are making some sort of change in the situation and want to predict the outcome. For example what will happen to the economy if we change fiscal or monetary policy in some way? This is why macroeconomists are so focused on establishing causal relationships.

In our example, suppose we observed that standing outside is correlated with higher cancer. So we change our policy and allow people to smoke in designated smoking rooms inside the building. Would this decrease the incidence of lung cancer?

**TL,DR:** Don't blurt out ""correlation does not imply causation"" without thinking whether it applies. The statement is true, but may not mean what you think it does in the context of prediction.",206

16-11-29,5fiekz,CRBP Starts one year open label extension for Phase 2,"Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRBP) (""Corbus"" or the ""Company""), a clinical stage drug development company targeting rare, chronic, serious inflammatory and fibrotic diseases, announced today that it is commencing a one-year, open-label extension study of the ongoing Phase 2 clinical study of Resunab (""JBT-101"") for the treatment of skin-predominant dermatomyositis. This open-label extension was submitted to and reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"").
The goal of the open-label extension dermatomyositis study is to provide all enrolled subjects with the option of receiving JBT-101 for one year after they complete the four-month, double-blind placebo controlled portion of the study and to collect long-term safety and efficacy on JBT-101. The safety and efficacy endpoints used in the double-blinded, placebo-controlled portion of the study will be assessed throughout the one year extension study.
Principal Investigator, Victoria P. Werth, M.D., Professor of Dermatology and Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, commented, ""There is a clear unmet need for effective therapeutic options for individuals living with skin-predominant dermatomyositis. Since the launch of the study, individuals have been very receptive to participating, and we look forward to further understanding the long-term safety and efficacy of JBT-101 through this open-label extension study.""
""We are delighted to offer the patients who complete the blinded portion of our skin-predominant dermatomyositis study the opportunity to receive JBT-101 for one year,"" stated Barbara White, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of the Company. ""The safety and efficacy data generated in this extended period will be valuable to the clinical advancement of JBT-101."" Yuval Cohen, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented, ""We are very pleased to implement this open-label extension in a second indication for JBT-101. This follows FDA approval of an open-label extension study for systemic sclerosis in April 2016 and the positive top-line Phase 2 clinical data in systemic sclerosis that we recently announced. We believe there is significant overlap between these serious autoimmune diseases, and we look forward to reporting top-line results from the Phase 2 dermatomyositis study in the third quarter of 2017. We view this as an important milestone for the Company, and we would like to express our gratitude to the study participants as well as to Dr. Werth and her clinical study team.""
The Phase 2 study in skin-predominant dermatomyositis is funded by a grant from the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases of the National Institutes of Health to the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.
For more information on the Phase 2 study with JBT-101 for the treatment of skin-predominant dermatomyositis, please visit ClinicalTrials.gov and reference Identifier NCT02466243.
About Dermatomyositis Dermatomyositis is a rare autoimmune disease of unknown etiology that is characterized by inflammation and subsequent damage to muscles and skin. People of any race, age, or gender can be afflicted by dermatomyositis, but it most commonly occurs in children and in adults age 50 to 70. Women develop dermatomyositis more often than men. Muscle inflammation can cause weakness, and create difficulty walking, lifting objects, climbing stairs, or swallowing. Skin involvement typically includes a distinctive reddish-purple rash on the upper eyelids, across the cheeks and bridge of the nose in a ""butterfly"" distribution; and scaling and changes of affected skin on the knuckles, elbows, knees, and other regions. Patients with dermatomyositis can develop interstitial lung disease and heart inflammation, which can be life-threatening, and their risk of developing cancer is increased. Dermatomyositis has a significant impact on day-to-day functioning of the patients and quality of life. Approximately 50,000 people in the United States and Europe suffer from this disease. There are currently no FDA-approved therapies specific to dermatomyositis.
About Resunab (""JBT-101"") JBT-101 is a novel synthetic oral endocannabinoid-mimetic drug that preferentially binds to the CB2 receptor expressed on activated immune cells and fibroblasts. CB2 activation triggers endogenous pathways that resolve inflammation and halt fibrosis. Preclinical and Phase 1 studies have shown JBT-101 to have a favorable safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile. It has also demonstrated promising potency in preclinical models of inflammation and fibrosis. JBT-101 is designed to trigger the production of ""Specialized Pro-resolving Lipid Mediators"" that activate an endogenous cascade responsible for the resolution of inflammation and fibrosis, while reducing production of multiple inflammatory mediators. JT-101 has direct effects on fibroblasts to halt tissue scarring. In effect, JBT-101 triggers endogenous pathways to turn ""off"" chronic inflammation and fibrotic processes, without causing immunosuppression.
About Corbus Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics to treat rare, chronic, and serious inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. Our lead product candidate, JBT-101, is a novel synthetic oral endocannabinoid-mimetic drug designed to resolve chronic inflammation, and fibrotic processes. JBT-101 is currently in Phase 2 clinical studies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis and skin-predominant dermatomyositis, with a fourth Phase 2 trial in systemic lupus erythematosus planned to commence during the first half of 2017.

* The Personal Care segment includes sales of skin care and hair care products, deodorants and oral care products. 
* The Foods segment includes sales of soups, bouillons, sauces, snacks, mayonnaise, salad dressings, margarines and spreads. 
* The Homecare segment includes sales of home care products, such as powders, liquids and capsules, soap bars and a range of cleaning products. 
* The Refreshment segment includes sales of ice cream and tela-based beverages. 

## Recent financials 

The company is based out of Europe and reports in Euro. So apols for the different symbol! Also, it reports 20-Fs to the SEC not 10-Ks and it's the ADR that's listed in the US on NYSE. But hopefully that doesn't put you off!

So here's the raw growth. Upward but lumpy.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | €53bn | €48bn | €50bn | €51bn | €46bn|
|EPS | €1.72 | €1.79 | €1.66 | €1.50 | €1.42|

Though with any multinational these sort of stats are hard to judge. So look at underlying growth (ex. currency fluctuations and M&amp;A) and operating margins.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Underlying sales growth | 4% | 3% | 4% | 7% | 7%|
|EPS | 14.1% | 16.5% | 15.1% | 13.6% | 13.8%|

So reasonable topline growth, even if the margin bounces around a bit.

## Competition

When it comes to competition, here's their view in the 20-F annual filing

&gt; As a fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company, we are competing with a diverse set of competitors. Some of these operate on an international scale like ourselves, while others have a more regional or local focus. Our business model centres on building brands which consumers know, trust, like and buy in conscious preference to competitors’. Our brands command loyalty and affinity and deliver superior performance.

Though the clear competitor in terms of scale has to be P&amp;G. And wow, they have great margins, when put up against UL. In fact UL's clearly not at the top of the class when it comes to margins, though it's returns aren't a concern.

## Cash / Debt?

Unilever plc (ADR) has $13,309M of net debt. That is 1.4x it's latest operating profit. Which doesn't feel aggressive.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $44.73 for Unilever plc (ADR) and their recommendation to clients is _Sell_. Which is rather weird, given that's an upside of 12% to their target. It's even weirder when you look at the broker recommendation for the UK listed version of the stock with a _Buy_ recommendation and a 17% upside to the target.

I suppose it highlights how the forecasts of ADRs and other metrics can end up looking rather screwy. Sometimes because different people or writing about the same underlying company. For example, only 2 brokers cover the US stock v 20 covering the UK version.

# Valuation

At 20x earnings, UL is at a discount to pretty much all the peers. And that's despite having better forecast growth. So I suppose a reversion to mean expectation could drive the stock to its target price.

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/ul/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|

KMB | $41,489M | 19x | 8% | 3% | 9%
EL | $28,821M | 23x | 10% | 2% | 7%

# Dividends

Unilever plc (ADR) is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.45 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $1.32 per share. That is a 10% growth. The forecast dividend of $1.45 compares to a forecast EPS of $1.96.

And as far as I can tell, there haven't been any buybacks.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -15% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 1%. Sounds harsh? Why?

On the management team's latest call with brokers they said:

&gt; we are on track to deliver our objectives for the year which are volume growth ahead of our market, steady improvement in core operating margin and strong cash flow. We are not expecting improvement in market conditions in the fourth quarter and indeed markets are likely to remain volatile and hence challenging for a while yet. However, we remain confident in the longer-term prospects for emerging markets and in our ability to navigate effectively and deliver steady performance through volatility.

So there's a little short term pain, and a headache in Latin America!

For now I can't tell how long the pain's going to be. But when there's light at the end of the tunnel, surely a quality stock will deserve another look?

16-11-28,5feru4,$OPHT DD HERE,"HELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOO everyone.

OPHT is an excellent stock for wsb. 

* It's super volatile
* It has a Phase 3 coming within 14 days
* The chances for success are extremely contested
* Fail will kill the stock, pass will soar it

Here's some thoughts. After extensive analysis let me explain that **there is no good hedge for this stock.**

If you're long equity and long puts, you will lose, possibly terribly, depending on your strategy. The stock would need to go below book value (&lt;$12) on failure for your R/R to be bi-directional on the $17.5 puts. This could change if IV shrinks a lot (which it won't).

What **is actually the most safe strategy** is to short the stock and go long far OTM calls - *at least $70s*.

Here's the breakdown of the actual trial:

Because regeneron's very similar drug failed in a P2, the market has assumed OPHT drug's will fail - it's down to about 35 from $60. This is a very strange predicament since OPHT already passed P2, and their drug isn't identical.

The results _could be statistically significant_ and ""pass"" but as per major analysts in the arena a letter increase (this is an eye sight trial) of &gt;2.5+ is required to move the stock, while 2.5 is the minimum requirement to pass.

Thus, in the options plays, the WORST outcome for either direction will be a 2.5 letter increase. That won't move the stock and all your OTM options are gonna die.

What we'll see with a 3 or greater improvement is a very large increase - possibly up to 70, 80, even 90. (Cowen gives a pt of $120, but cmon).

Why short + calls = best.

The upside is enormous for this and if you get some OTM calls, and we see &gt;70 movement, 60 calls will be hitting ~&gt;100%. We could easily see &gt;$80 on a 3-letter improvement, making 70 calls very lucrative.

If it fails, of course your far otm calls will die, but puts won't be worth it. Shorting the stock is the best option, as you'll see at least a 50% drop, and given you spent less than 50% of your equity position on calls - you're in the black.

Again, if you play this with options, and we get a 2.5 letter grade improvment, the drug will ""pass"" but the stock will meander.",116

16-11-29,5fiss8,"TIF beats on earnings, surges 4%","I recommended this trade in Copy My Trades (damonverial.com). I'll post it below to give you an idea of when and why I make a long call play before earnings:

Damon here.
 
Today is Black Friday, which means the market stops trading at 1pm. That’s fine, because we aren’t getting in on a specifically timed play. I hope you enjoyed Thanksgiving, by the way.
 
Let’s get started. I’m looking to take a long position into earnings on TIF. I could write an in-depth earnings analysis here, and I just might do so in Exposing Earning. But you guys get the first peek into my basic thesis before the company reports on Monday; here it is, in a somewhat scatterbrained organization:
 
SIG, another jewelry company recently reported a beat, suggesting a bullishness in this sector. TIF is a rarity in the jewelry market in that it is the only well-known US brand. The advantage of it being a US company that primarily makes its profit in the US is not having to deal with Forex issues; a strong dollar does not hurt TIF so much.
 
Fundamentally, we should not predict any surprises in margins or growth. EPS growth has been negative for the past six quarters. That might change this quarter, and if it does, it will be taken as a sign of growth turnaround. We are not banking on that, but it’s a good catalyst.
 
TIF is going to be presenting forward guidance on its FQ4 during this quarter’s earnings. FQ4 is TIF’s best quarter and the main profit-driver of the company. Guidance should be strong.
 
Why?
 
For one, retail sales and spending are picking back up in the US, specifically in the luxury market. But of more interest to TIF investors recently is its flagship store, which brings in 30% of TIF’s sales and 10% of its profits. This store is located right next to the Trump Tower and has been the focus of concerned, nervous TIF investors.
 
Are the nearby protests reducing sales?
Is the red tape preventing customers from entering the store?
 
If you search the news quickly, the answers seem to be “yes.” But how much of that news is real and how much of it is part of a lingering “blame Trump” mentality in the liberal media? Others have reported unobstructed entrances to the store and strong foot traffic. 
 
This is the typical overreaction you get when an easily understood news item can be interpreted by investors. Overall, if you limit the supply of a luxury item or raise the barriers to obtaining it, you make it more enticing, fueling demand. It’s an abstract concept, certainly moreso than: 
 
“Trump president; neighboring doors hard to open; Trump bad; Chinese tourist scared, no buy jewelry; TIF stock down; my aunt said Apple computers are easy to use so we should buy Apple stock…”
 
…low-level thinking for low-level traders and investors. Ignore the news, at least on the surface, please.
 
This is TIF’s strong season. And it covers earnings. The probability that TIF rises on a beat is nearly 100%; the probability that TIF rises on a miss is nearly 50%.
 
The statistics are on our side regardless of last quarter, which I believe will be good anyhow. The focus is guidance. Management will likely point to everything I just pointed to above: strengthening sales, a possible turnaround in EPS on the way, and a positive spin on the Trump presidency/neighborhood.
 
If TIF is treated as a luxury stock, it is fairly valued. If it is treated as a retail stock it is undervalued. Either way, this does not put the risk profile against us; rather, it works in our favor, especially with options.
 
Today will be our last day to open this trade, and as evidenced by Wedneday, many are already buying last-minute. We will too. Here is our play:
 
Buy TIF Dec16 $75 call
 
This is an at-the-money call that maximizes our gamma – i.e., we gain the best nonlinear risk/reward profile possible with a long call at this strike. Because TIF is a “reverter” after earnings, it dips a bit after a rally and rises a bit after a fall. We can regain ground if we are wrong, but we should sell immediately if we are right.
 
Why a pure long call? Simply because options are fairly valued on TIF right now. No need to overcomplicate things, especially seeing as I get follow-up emails every time I send out a complex options strategy; we only have a few hours to open this trade, so we shouldn’t be racking our brains with the reasoning for the strategy.
 
That’s it for today. Happy trading.",0

Example: If I start with $10000 in Q100, $8000 will go to IJR and $2000 will go to VFIIX.

Next quarter, Q200, if IJR is down, I would sell enough VFIIX shares to buy until I get $8240 (103% of $8000) of IJR.

If in Q300 IJR gained exactly 3%, then I would not do anything.

My retirement and childrens college funds are in the hands of index funds, which i hope employ people better than i would ever be. Anyway....

Through a series of slumdog millionaire-esque events i have a found a company that i want to personally invest in.

It's a pharmaceutical holding company traded on the tokyo stock exchange (i am located in the good ole USofA). They recently acquired another company with impressive research.

I only have $999 that i can afford to burn on this long shot.
They are currently trading at $140/ share

I want to know the best way to  throw $999 at it, and forget about it for 5 years. Hopefully by then, their drug will be approved and be the first one of the market for a certain condition.

# Background

First a little background from wikipedia. Photolithography systems are used by the for the semiconductor industry for the production of integrated circuits (ICs), such as CPUs, DRAM memory, flash memory.

&gt; In these machines, patterns are optically imaged onto a silicon wafer that is covered with a film of light-sensitive material (photoresist). This procedure is repeated dozens of times on a single wafer. The photoresist is then further processed to create the actual electronic circuits on the silicon. The optical imaging these machines deal with is used in the fabrication of nearly all integrated circuits.

# Description
ASML Holding N.V. is engaged in the development, production, marketing, selling and servicing of advanced semiconductor equipment systems, exclusively consisting of lithography systems. Again, it's rather technical...

&gt; Our systems are essentially projection systems, not unlike a slide projector. Laser light is projected using a so-called mask (also called a reticle), which contains the blueprint of the pattern that will be printed. A lens or mirror focuses the pattern onto the wafer -a thin, round slice of semiconductor material- which is coated with a light-sensitive chemical. When the unexposed parts are etched away, the pattern is revealed. Because lithography patterns the structures on a chip, it is lithography that determines how small the features on the chip can be, and how densely chip makers can pack transistors together. In other words, lithography is crucial to follow the path described by Moore’s Law.

Wow! But more importantly all the top 10 chip manufacturers are their customers.

## Recent financials 

Now, given we covered Unilever yesterday, seems we are in Dutch ADR heaven. So, don't be surprised that everything is in €€€ again!

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | €6.3bn | €5.9bn | €5.2bn | €4.7bn | €5.7bn|
|EPS | €3.21 | €2.72 | €2.34 | €2.68 | €3.42|

Oddly, there's been a few lean years and the business only back to it 2011 levels now.

## Competition

Here's the view on the competition

&gt; We compete primarily with Nikon and Canon in respect of systems. Each of Nikon and Canon have substantial financial resources and broad patent portfolios. Each continues to introduce new products with improved price and performance characteristics that compete directly with our products, which may cause a decline in our sales or a loss of market acceptance for our lithography systems. 

Though there's one other, US player they highlight

&gt; We also compete with providers of software applications that support or enhance complex patterning solutions, including lithography, such as KLA-Tencor Corporation. These applications effectively compete with our holistic lithography offering, which has become an increasingly significant part of our business.

Sadly it's not possible to compare the margins with Nikon or Canon at a glance since they are conglomerates. Though the comparison with KLA is favorable :) Other semi-equipment companies also shed ASML in a good light.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
ASML Holding NV (ADR) | $6,709M | 35% | 18%
Nikon Corp | $6,730M | 9% | 4%
Canon Inc (ADR) | $31,084M | 17% | 7%
KLA-Tencor Corp | $3,093M | 36% | 145%

Fortive Corp | $6,159M | 23% | 23%
Lam Research Corporation | $5,918M | 23% | 15%

## Cash / Debt?

ASML Holding NV (ADR) has $2,041M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 4% of the market value of ASML Holding NV (ADR).

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $114.75 for ASML Holding NV (ADR) and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 11% to their target.

# Valuation

The buy recommendation and price target are pretty remarkable given the PE of 29x! It's almost twice the valuation of KLA.

LRCX.O | $17,385M | 13x | 12% | 1% | 7%

# Dividends

ASML Holding NV (ADR) is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.25 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $0.74 per share. That is a 69% growth. The forecast dividend of $1.25 compares to a forecast EPS of $3.59. Nice growth and low payout. Tough the yield is only 1%. 

Though they do have a EUR 1.5 billion repurchase program as well.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -4% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 2%. That's against the nine month sales up just 1% And earnings off 13%.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, they said:

&gt; Although it's too early to formulate a full quantitative view about next year, we started to develop a qualitative view based upon early customer forecasts and our own modeling capability. Both of the memory sectors are expected to show solid bit growth again next year not too dissimilar from this year. 

Which sounds good. Though there are 2 other catalysts to look at, perhaps:

a) the acquisition of HMI. Cost $3bn and only just closed. How will this impact the performance of the business
b) Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography: which is a new technology that will start having topline impact next year.

As result the forecast is for sales to hit EU 7.5bn in 2017 from forecast Eu 6.6bn in 2016. And a substantial increase in profitability too.

Great at the outlook is, it just feels like it's in the price at the moment :(.

The ad was trying to encourage  people to buy silver by mentioning that silver is at a very low price now and a 60% to 200% return is expected if silver returns to its all time high. Being the suspicious person I am, I am wondering what is the financial incentive of anyone to ""sell"" silver (or anything of that matter) if the person expects that what's being sold is going to dramatically increase in value. Are they not honest about their expectations? or are there legitimate financial reasons for when this can be a justifiable decision for some individuals?",1

Personally I like how they've diversified more recently (into collectibles and Tech brands) and their Q3 Earnings looked great (at least better than last year). Additionally I believe a lot of their recent struggles are because there hasn't been any new console releases in a couple years. On top of that they currently have a yield just under 6%. I don't really see their shares hitting 40 again but possibly in the 30s after the release of the next console?

16-11-30,5fn3js,Profiting from cognitive biases,"Two questions:  What cognitive bias has the biggest influence on markets and what bias is likely to have the biggest impact on your own returns? Both could have the same answer.

I'd say that loss aversion (tendency for people to dislike losses more than 2x the amount they like equivalent gains) has the biggest impact on the market.  I'd say it's definitely the most observable as you can attribute large panic induced sell-offs at least partly to loss aversion.

However, I'd say overconfidence bias is the most important for my own returns.  I've noticed that, a lot of the time when I make an investment that doesn't work out, I didn't have as good of a grasp on how the business works as I thought I did.  Although, this observation could be subject to confirmation bias! I want to believe that my investment performance is determined by my knowledge and skill or lack there of, rather than randomness.

""Yet if anything, Thor sounds even more optimistic about its future. As Martin put it, **""We believe 2017 will be one of the strongest years for wholesale shipments for the industry since the 1970s.""**

""On a segment-by-segment basis, Thor looked uniformly strong. Motorized RV sales jumped by 84%, with about two-thirds of the revenue rise coming from Jayco. Sales of moderately priced gasoline-powered class A and class C motorhomes were strongest, given their popularity among people buying their first RV. Income growth for the segment was more modest, rising by about a third, but backlogs doubled from year-ago levels.

Meanwhile, the towable RV segment was also a big winner. Sales were up 63%, largely because of the Jayco acquisition, but organic growth was up 19% on strength in the travel trailer business. Pretax income jumped by nearly half, and Thor pointed to cost containment strategies as playing a vital role in boosting the bottom line. Backlogs nearly doubled in the segment.""

""Thor Industries (THO +12.6%) races higher after beating estimates with its FQ1 report.

Thor management cited ""enthusiastic"" demand for its products from both dealers and consumers. Backing up that statement, Thor reported RV backlog more than doubled Y/Y to $2.11B.

My Mom's asked me to help her navigate the financial labyrinth  to claim cash on shares of Stratos Global which she purchased in 2001. Bear with me because I'm Investopdia'ing it is I go

From what I can gather, Stratos was acquired by CIP Canada in 2007 at a price of [$7.00 per share](http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/acquisition-of-stratos-by-cip-canada-completed-tsx-sgb-801919.htm). The press release I just linked states it was a cash purchase. Am I right in saying this means her 800 shares vanished to be replaced with $5600, instead of merging to become shares of CIP?

If it was just a straight cash conversion, where did this money go after the 2007 acqisition? Mom's kept her stock certificate, which at the top says ""This certificate has been countersigned and registered by the Computershare Canadian trust company, the successor agent"". Mom gave them a call and apparently they weren't even remotely helpful. Are these the guys who would be holding her cash? If so, any tips on dealing with them in order to get this figured out?

Now I am confused by this part does this say the same thing.

(2) Is coupon then just your predeterment value of your yields because of the par value e.g. 

&gt; If you buy a bond with a 10% coupon at its $1,000 par value, the yield is 10% ($100/$1,000). Pretty simple stuff. But if the price goes down to $800, then the yield goes up to 12.5%. This happens because you are getting the same guaranteed $100 on an asset that is worth $800 ($100/$800). Conversely, if the bond goes up in price to $1,200, the yield shrinks to 8.33% ($100/$1,200).

(3) can someone explain what they mean by "" bringing them into line with newer bonds being issued with higher coupons"" and ""bringing them into line with newer bonds being issued with lower coupons.""

&gt;When interest rates rise, the prices of bonds in the market fall, thereby raising the yield of the older bonds and bringing them into line with newer bonds being issued with higher coupons. When interest rates fall, the prices of bonds in the market rise, thereby lowering the yield of the older bonds and bringing them into line with newer bonds being issued with lower coupons.

(4) What if P/E ratio is negative how does the "" The share price is trading 50 times the P/E ratio meaning it is overvalued"" apply ",1

But correct me if im wrong, I'm just an inexperienced college student trying to learn. 

When looking at the bank etf $KBE, it shows that the price took a hit after rates were increased December of 2015. 

Was this because of the interest hike, or was there another factor that caused bank stocks to slip in early 2016? I remember that there was a general feeling of anxiety in the stock market at the beginning of the year, but I want to know if there is another reason why bank stocks slipped. Thanks!",2

16-11-30,5fsi7m,SPCL: I believe fraud was committed by IHUB users trying to tank the stock for personal gain.,"QTRADERQ Posted a screen shot of an email today that caused the stock to plummet 30%. Here is why I think it was fake and he has committed serious fraud for personal gain.

 1. He will not post the HEADER so that we can analyzer the email to see if it is real or not.

https://mxtoolbox.com/Public/Content/EmailHeaders/#Gmail

 2. If the email was real it states that it is confidential so that is FRAUD also.

 3. QTRADERQ has a history of bashing stocks. He has been bashign SPCL for a while. A couple days ago he predicted a big fall coming soon. He also posts very misleading things such as:

***NASDAQ UPLISTING DELAYED 1 YEAR TO DEC 2017 ****	Solaris Power Cells Inc. (SPCL)	11/28/2016 09:15:04 AM 
******** UPLISTING DELAYED 1 YEAR TO DEC 2017 ******* 

 5. Right before/when this was dropping the board was filled with bashers that came out of nowhere. A typical scare tactic.

 6. What kind of lawyer would ever, ever give out legal info lol.... and has time to answer to random peoples emails.

 7. IHUB is trying to cover this up by deleting any post explaining that fraud is going on. IHUB is known to be VERY SKETCHY, so I wouldn't be surprised if they were in on this lol.

 8. When the email showed up they put a HUGE wall on the ask and ran down the price. Another shorting tactic.

 9. IHUB banned a lot of posters from posting on that board who provide them with great DD on both sides. While people who are bashing the stock, threatening others, and posting lies are not. ",12

In my entire career i've only ever met one man who I suspect is genuinely bright enough to find profitability where others haven't. Thats one person in thousands, across Wealth Management firms, Hedge Funds, Investment Banks and Oxbridge Universities..                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
The ability to identify potential for large payoffs, fully estimate the risk and be positioned to take advantage is the golden goose, if you think you've got it by the tailfeathers then all power to you - just keep in mind there are trillions of dollars, pounds, yen and euros being managed by the worlds highest paid individuals, from the worlds top universities, using the worlds most powerful computers - all looking for the exact same golden goose you think you've found - and they've been doing this for over 900 years..                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
The fact of the matter is you have to be brutally cyclical. Why do you think most private investors (you) lost money in '09? Or in '01, '97, 73'? 1929? or 1772?                                                                                                             
The primary reason private investment capital is always noted in the history books for being swept out the door in a crash is every man likes to believe he's being canny while the market is a big hairy bull. The moment things reverse those same people lose their savings, houses and blame it on bankers and politicians. Then in hindsight every closeted idiot is willing to say ""just buy the dip"" or ""you could have seen it coming"". There are far too many armchair imbeciles that lurk around investing forums, seminars or write books and make sundance-festival-sob-stories about how unfair the world is.                                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
So for the love of god let go of the idea that you're Soros or Buffet - you're not and never will be.

1-) I wasn't able to find why this incredible boost happenned, and how could those datas be found the fastest (to be able to be one of the first to know the boost is happening).

2-) The momentum is still high for this company. What is the best way to take advantage of it? I know this is the kind of stuff where everybody want a piece of the cake, but it's also dangerous to go in too late.

16-11-30,5fo14m,"Investor(s); Thoughts to Ponder when working with the next FB, MS, APPLE, SpaceX (BIG IDEA).","Investors looking for that Hole In One Idea... This is a little long, but I guarantee a great read for you.

Many of these posts are about, where do I put my money? How do I conduct my due diligence? Are there any APPLES, Microsoft's, Facebooks, or has everything been invented. 

The answer to this is, we are really on the cusp of some technological leaps that are going to put these last advances to shame. 

Most technology that has been invented has been quite DUMB...Great at collecting, saving, retrieving, collaborating, etc... Still, though, creating silos of information that just sits on little islands waiting to be handled. 

Here we are now at the edge of something new called ""Machine Learning."" The ability to exponentially grab millions of lines of data, mathematically process it (algorithms), the provide a result that will guide person, machine, application... anything at the ""Speed of Live."" 

There are areas today that are earning investors significant returns into the future. Let's name a few... Uber, Travel Web Sites, Autonomous Cars, SpaceX, Tesla, Stock Market Analysis Engines ( Maybe on the edge of ethically illegal), you get me drift here. Things that process millions of lines of information in milliseconds giving a result that would have taken hours, weeks or months before. Let alone systems out of Darpa and MIT for Defense programs. Scary! 

But yes, all of which require investors. Smart, savvy investors that understand that to bake a loaf of bread needs time for the yeast to raise, and great bread, must be knocked back down several times over before it then must spend time in the oven before it goes to market. 

These investors are not those that are going to watch gains and losses daily but be about exploration of the unknown. Believe in a principle and participate to the point to where they do not hinder or stop the progress of innovation. 

Innovation and Investment go hand in hand. Many investors I meet that get involved in innovation say, well let the customer pay up front? Sell it first! These I believe will be the wrong investor. These investors need to be investments making widgets, which then drop the returns down to less than the stock market. 

Let's look at Elon Musk who must have sounded crazy when he went into launching spacecraft. He was quoted as saying, he was unsure if he could even get a rocket into space safely. He knew by his education, innovative, creative drive and his passion he could take a few investors on a ride of their life. Today, his company, not without risk, is creating huge competition against the Boeing, Lockheed, and others. Creating Competition that is driving our space programs in the US towards goals much faster than NASA alone could. This is called capitalism at its best. Some of these early investors are going to make incredible amounts of money with Elon Musk. 

Here are other tips...I have found in my experience with dealing with these investment deals myself. 

The typical, let's look at your portfolio, customers, etc... are not always appropriate in what I call ""Exponential Opportunities,"" these are opportunities yielding 30:1 ratios across 3 to 5 years. Allow the company you are investing in, the small investment to express themselves in a small scale version of their end product. 

You are saying WHAT? Yes, rather than saying SHOW ME NOW, YES OR NO...cultivate and peel back the onion on the artist, the technologist, the futurist that sits in front of you. 

This is where it get's crazy...which innovation is not a science, it has so many unknowns on how it is derived and gifted to those that have it. Spend a little money. Not on Due-Diligence, or testing of financials, but the testing of the idea. Give the innovator the tools to animate the concept in a media that can be understood by all. Then you will then, only then, start to see the potential of the technology behind it. 

I am sure that Elon Musk did not build a rocket first in the desert and keep firing it off. He proved it in principle, through modeling and animation. He showed the possibility, and at the same time he was showing his development team through that investment what had been parked in the back of his mind for so long. 

What is humorous about this, is every investor wants an Elon Musk in their portfolio. But they do not know how to work with the wild world of technological innovation on a big scale. 

What is funny, is that it is almost proven that innovators are dot connectors. They see the end picture; the see the raw physics behind their invention. This does not translate well in columns and rows. 

The key in all of this, to put this into columns and rows, is what is the need for this technology. Can the technology not just be an island in itself but drive the old technologies. 

For instance. Let's go back to Elon. He has figured out a more efficient way to build rockets, launch them, retrieve them to fuel programs already on the books. 

Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Administrative Assistants, Teaching Assistants, Manufacturing Assistants (Robotics), etc... are all about vision, possibilities, innovation that can't be captured in your accountant's ledger. Not until you see the scaled model work, and a small team understands where it fits into the puzzle of the markets. 

If you are an investor, do you want 5% returns (Zero Risk), 8% - 12% returns (Stocks), or are you ready to allow your money cultivate innovation with the right gifted mind or company with the next big thing! 

I have theories on how to work with innovators, and that if companies are creating new Exponential Growth products, you need not salesmen, but investment managers and department to manage the lifecycle, inflows, and outflows of technological portfolios. 

I have a passion for companies that have holistic growth from an idea to a market-wide product. These are not anomalies; these are processes that when controlled and worked with can be very predictable and controlled. 

I am hoping this grows into a conversation that can inspire and give foresight into the scary world of investments on edge. They do not have to be on the brink if you spend a little before you invest a lot. And once you understand innovation and technology, you can see where these innovators are not crazy mad people, but dreamers... their world is not about the money, it is about getting their idea working in reality. Give them the space, time, resources... Hire an illustrator/animation team to extract their idea, so everyone can then touch it, see it, smell it..., etc...

Share your thoughts as an investor, how do you deal not with the stock portfolio or widget factory, but the guy turning nothing into something. You put that in your portfolio, you have a story and the wealth to show it. 

My bottom line is: I believe all this talk about market testing, columns and rows and 100's of pages of due-diligence is wrong. You put the right investor(s) and the latest Elon Musk together; you have an engine of wealth. 

Now that you made it to here... Vote me up, Link, spread the word? Feel free to send a reply! Love it!

16-11-30,5ft31x,"While We Weren’t Looking, Snapchat Revolutionized Social Networks","http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/30/technology/while-we-werent-looking-snapchat-revolutionized-social-networks.html

'There is, instead, a practiced authenticity. The biggest stars — even Kylie Jenner — get ahead by giving you deep access to their real lives. As a result, much of what you see on Snapchat feels less like a performance than on other networks. People aren’t fishing for likes and follows and reshares. For better or worse, they’re trying to be real.'

Clickbaity title but I think the article does a good job articulating why Snapchat is having success as a social network and why the content on their platform is pretty sticky. Content is king pretty much everywhere and it will be interesting to see how FB responds to this. They are pushing FB Live a LOT (like i see tons of TV ads specifically for that feature) and Instagram has their 'story' option but I don't think those are getting tons of traction. I don't think copying snapchat will be the answer for them. Thoughts?",3

16-11-30,5fprwb,Lots Tons of Money in the Bond Market,"Due to Trump winning, I lost about $5k in the treasury bond market, a figure which keeps growing . I felt like my life was fucked, and it still mostly is. This represent  quarter of my personal savings that I earned from various jobs and such. Like an idiot I put money in 10-year treasuries and used leverage (by buying put options on an inverse treasury ETF)  and it cost me dearly  after Trump won. It's not something that is going to get better. The 5k is gone . The remaining amount will be gone too, shortly. There is some extrinsic value on the options. The past month has been horrible. Even wake up in the middle night thinking about it. Every time the dollar goes higher, bonds go down and I lose a few hundred dollars. Finished. done deal. FU trump, pos mmother fucker . I even supported him.until I lost money. but is a silver lining

A few weeks ago, shortly after the Trump-induced loss, I decided to regain focus to get my stock broker licence (it was something I always had in the back of my mind and never got around to fully committing myself to due to laziness and other factors) and my parents asked me to help them with their retirement plans, because retirement plans are part of the broker exam. Needless to say, there is enough money in the accounts that I will never have to work and the $5k loss in the bonds is a rounding error, even though losing the money still sucks and represents  a crushing personal failure (on top of many other failures) on my part.  The point is, things can get better in unexpected ways.

 My investment advice is to stay away from fixed income. and don't use leverage. neither are safe . Either: invest in the S&amp;P 500 or put it in cash. Avoid bonds and reits. But too late now for me

16-11-30,5fqdju,Zacks Ultimate Service - any thoughts?,"I was recently offered a 30 day trial of Zacks Ultimate Service for  $1. They have a bunch of services/portfolios catering to different investing philosophies (large cap, under $10 stocks, shorting, momentum picks, etc). They send out intra-day alert emails whenever one of those services makes a trade (along with some data points and reasoning) and there's a daily summary of every portfolio.
Based on about 3 weeks of using this service, I've seen multiple picks of theirs already in double digit gains and maybe one or two in the red. Is this just a fluke? As someone who's constantly struggling to find time to learn more about investment research, this feels pretty valuable.
Curious to know what others think of this service and its value.

16-11-30,5fqpda,How is open price determined? What causes unexplained large gaps down?,"Apologies for the long post, something happened today and made me wonder about how exactly the open price is determined and whether it’s possible that the open price is manipulated to trigger other people’s open sell orders by creating a very temporary gap down in price. This may be totally common knowledge to people that trade more than me but It caught me off guard this morning so I thought it might be worth discussing with others. 

For background I am very much a long term investor but I started making some short and midterm plays on a few of the companies I track closely mainly just for fun. I had a profitable position in Southwest ($LUV) from several purchases made in late October before the price went up when Buffet announced he was buying shares, in total the position was up around 18% on average in two months. 

I had recently watched some trading videos one of which got me interested in trailing stop order so I decided to try this out thinking this would be a good way to lock in the gains on my $LUV position in case it started going down and also thinking I could take my eyes off the trade and focus on another company I was trading. 

So yesterday when the stock was around $47.50 I placed a 1% trailing stop sell order. The price declined slightly throughout the day and into closing but never dropped enough to trigger the order. This morning right at open I got an alert that the trade had executed. I looked to see the stock opened with a big gap down and huge volume in the very first seconds of the day and then within minutes petty much rebounded back to around yesterdays closing. End result was my I sold for at least $1.30 per share less than it would have liked and lost about 3% of the gain I was expecting in that one blip down and then up. 

So obviously I screwed up having this trailing limit order going and now consider it a pretty good learning experience as far as the hidden risk of having any limit orders running for more than a day at a time as it exposes you to this major risk of a huge gap down in the first second of the trading day. 

I can't help but wonder what exactly is happening behind the scenes when a stock gaps down for no reason at open and then immediately (within a few minutes) goes right back up. Is this a well-known legitimate strategy that computer traders or fund managers use to grab shares on the cheap? If so it sure seems like it would be possible and very easy for various groups to coordinate their actions and agree to quickly buy and sell some shares back and forth right at open at well below market prices just to trigger other people’s sell orders to fire at this artificially low market price and then unload them a few minutes’ later once the price rebounds back to normal.

16-11-30,5fqxt5,Best stocks for 2017 - my predictions,"$AKS - The only real profitable steel stock with plenty of room for further growth. It is both a value and growth stock. Better than $X and $STLD. The predicted earnings (and surprise factor) for $AKS is through the roof, much stronger than $X and $STLD. 

$RSX - OPEC just cut oil production which will benefit Russia and Iran the most. $RSX is an ETF managed by VanEck which is a US investment management company, and tracks Russia's commodities, industrials and resource-heavy companies. Russia's economy is already forecast to come out of recession in 2017. 1.6%~1.8% is the Russian economy's projected GDP growth rate WITHOUT an OPEC oil production cut, and this will go higher now, maybe even pushing &gt;2% GDP growth rate. The $RSX hit rock-bottom on January 15, 2016 (a level not seen since the 2008/2009 GFC) and has been rising since then. It's still early, so I highly recommend getting in before everyone jumps in (hindsight is always 20/20.. once this ETF rises by 100%+, then all the average Joes will start to get in as always). The $RSX is only just starting to rise, and is still cheap, much better value and has a superior growth prospect compared to the small-cap $RSXJ, which has doubled this year. The $RSX has huge potential to double by end of next year, maybe even triple, seeing how elite investors are so bullish on Russia (you don't see this on the front pages of Bloomberg or MarketWatch). I just made $1200 off of it today. The $RSX is industrials/commodities heavy, an area which Russia struggled with since international sanctions were placed on it due to Crimea and Syria. Now with the Obama/Clinton administration gone, these sanctions will get gradually eased. Republicans may be hawkish on Russia, but much less so than the Obama- and Clinton-led Democrats. And Trump is known to be much more diplomatic towards Russia than Clinton. Plus I don't think there is an Iran ETF, nor would I consider investing in it anyway with Trump's negative stance on Iran. 
Note: I strongly believe that Russia will be the best emerging market to invest in for 2017~2020. This is because Russia has faced a catastrophic economic collapse from 2014~2016 and is only starting to improve. Brazil's economy has been mired by internal problems, not due to sanctions. Therefore, Brazil and other South American/Central American markets pose continual risks as a Trump presidency does not present them with any advantages. Mexico will prove to be very a volatile market to invest in under a US Trump presidency. India is currently experiencing a cash crisis. Peruvian and other small South American ETFs have already soared too much in 2015/2016. $RSX is the best investment among emerging market ETFs with the potential for higher, sustained returns. 

$GM - rising oil prices usually don't mean great gasoline car sales. However, $GM is beating $TSLA to the affordable all-electric vehicle race and $GM has increased its profitability in the most recent quarter. This is set to improve dramatically over 2017. Trump, although criticizing $GM over manufacturing cars overseas such as in Mexico, is known to be friendly towards $GM. $GM will perform much better than $TSLA as the new all-electric Chevy Bolt will be delivered to customers in January 2017, whereas $TSLA will most likely delay the release and deliveries of the Tesla Model 3. 

$FCX - OPEC just cut oil production and copper is still in booming mode. The stock is still down 75% from its 2010-highs. Enough said. DO NOT BELIEVE analysts who downgrade this stock. Many of them think they have missed the $FCX train and want to bring down the stock. For example, Berenberg attempted to bring down the stock today by downgrading $FCX to ""Sell"", yet the stock rose 3.15% today &amp; after-hours. Absolute nonsense. This is a high growth stock continuing into 2017. 

$MU - the semiconductor industry has been booming due to rising DRAM prices. The companies that have benefited the most are Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix and Micron ($MU). However, Samsung Electronics is trading at all-time highs and you can't buy SK Hynix except on an ETF or a non-easily-accessible ADR. Therefore, buying $MU makes more sense. $MU is still down 50% from its 2014-highs and will most likely reach this level or surpass that by 2017~2018. DRAM prices will only increase as demand for AI and more complex electronic components in cars increases. And let's not forget Intel's massive drive into 3D XPoint and AI as well. The semiconductor industry will continue to see a boom continuing forwards. 

$HUM - the most profitable and bullish private healthcare stock under a Trump presidency.

$BAC - bullish banking stock. Not just this stock, though. There are many many US banking corporations to choose from, some obviously better choices (e.g. $GS) than others. 

$LMT, $RTN, $NOC, $HEI, $ESLT - Aerospace and defense stocks will be bullish under a Republican government. Very priced in ATM. 

Dark horses:

$AMD - up ~300% in 2016. Vega and Zen will be major potential growth drivers. I certainly see $AMD having major upside potential if these are even moderately successful. And $AMD is returning to profitability. We will see what happens. Its partnership with $GOOGL is looking very promising for revenue and profit growth too. 

$NVDA - similar to $AMD, up nearly 300% this year. It's range expansion on Nov 10, 2016 to the $80~$90 range was a huge surprise for most investors. Since then, it has lost forward momentum. I think $NVDA will see a moderate increase in its stock price in the short-medium term (a drawback soon is to be expected, though, looking at MACD and RSI), and it can potentially reach $150 by end of 2017. If $TSLA fails to deliver, it could be risky for $NVDA. However, in the long run, AI is still required for all types of driverless vehicle technology as well as other AI applications such as robotics and deep learning, as well as defense projects. So any trouble at $TSLA does not present a high extrapolated risk to $NVDA. Plus strong GPU sales and partnerships in the console space should protect $NVDA from hitting its stock price when uncertainty looms in the AI world. 

Stocks NOT to buy:

$TSLA - Time after time, $TSLA has disappointed its investors. The SEC is now accusing $TSLA with reporting unrealistic accounting numbers. $TSLA will most likely be late in releasing and delivering its Model 3 vehicles due to the $SCTY merger. There are also rumors that Panasonic may charge Tesla more for its batteries. So this may shift Tesla to seek other ventures with companies such as LG Chem, which may prove to be more expensive than initially thought. 

$AAPL - Lack of innovation much? The new Macbook is a complete disaster. $AAPL should be a much better buy before September 2017, though. I do believe that the iPhone 8 will be a form factor upgrade, which should boost sales, although the boost wont be anything like iPhone 5S -&gt; iPhone 6. The iPhone 8 may have a curved AMOLED display similar to the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge/Galaxy Note 7. Competition from Samsung may also be a risk factor as Samsung is heavily investing into AI integration into their phones, and their recent acquisition of Harman may prove to be highly advantageous for their smartphones as well as their auto parts business. It doesn't help that Apple failed to capitalize on Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 recall scandal. Apple is a highly profitable company, however 2016 has seen its debt skyrocket. We shall see what happens with this stock, however it is not a good short-medium term play by any means and is not a good buy now for the long term either. This is because $AAPL stock is cyclical in nature (more so than other stocks) and tends to fall during November-January. Buy now at your own risk.

16-11-30,5fr8eg,"First time investing. What I did right, what I did wrong, what I don't know what I did.","After my freshman year of college I decided to enroll in a few summer courses to get ahead. (I'm a junior now, so this was a little over a year ago.) I took a few classes but the one that stood out to me was Macro Econ. My professor was amazing, really engaging and made the class enjoyable. I would stay after every class to discuss new questions I had and get his opinion. Eventually we got to the topic of career choices and I told him because of his class I was leaning towards Wealth Management. 

Of course before I go head first in a career I should get my feet wet right? All I really know is that you're supposed to buy these portions of companies when they are cheap and sell them when they are high for a profit. So after saving up $500, I managed to find my way to ETrade. 

Let me stop there and explain my first mistake. ETrade is an amazing platform, they give you tons of useful information, charts, news, everything. Too bad I had no idea what any of it meant. So here I am paying $9.99 a trade and watching my $500 get eaten alive. Basically my shares would have to make a combined profit of $20 before I could even think about selling them or I would lose money. You can quickly see how this was set up for failure. I basically wanted to throw away $500.

But wait. I don't even know what stocks to pick. I'm not trying to day trade or anything, so why not pick a few companies that I know and let it go from there? First issue. I have only $500 to work with. That means if I want a lot of shares they have to be cheap in price. I can't afford the likes of Amazon, Google, or Apple. I wanted a blue chip (that is a reputable company like Disney, Google, AT&amp;T, that you have no doubt will go on forever) and let the dividends pay up. So I put a couple hundred into AT&amp;T and let it go. 

Diversification. This is the hard part. With only $500 to work with and no prior knowledge to the stock market, I knew my only option was to invest into a mutual fund. We hear about those all the time right? Well I'll explain why this is a terrible idea for $250. First of all, all the ""good"" funds that have great returns are super expensive to get into. They have large minimum deposits, larger fees for withdrawing, ect. With a mere $250 I had to choose one that wasn't so special. In the long run it was actually losing money so I decided to pull out and pay additional fees. At one point my portfolio was worth $380... Yikes. If only I knew about ETFs, they are the equivalence of a mutual fund wrapped into a share. Investopedia does a great job explaining it. But if I could go back I would probably just go for ETF's.Oh well.

Eventually I started adding more money into my portfolio. I didn't make the mistake of buying occasionally everytime I put money into my ETrade account either. I started letting my cash build up before I would invest so I would only pay the $9.99 fee once, while it still hurt, it was not as bad.

I purchased stupid things like GoPro. Yes I know. I bought it at $12, right before they released the drone. I figured that it would shoot up after their revenue was released for the quarter following it's release (The drone had issues and was recalled...I lost money). I purchased Smith &amp; Wesson (Gun company after Trump was elected) figured if the right won they'd have a huge sale. Turns out if the left had won I should have. They use the fear of ""Hillary/Obama will take your guns"" to drive sales and now with Trump in charge there really is no fear.

The one right choice I think I made was buying NVIDIA. So while at school I work at Best Buy. I keep seeing an increasing sale in gaming computers for Virtual Reality gaming, I purchased a graphics card from Nvidia because of the performance per $, and thought Nvidia is a really great brand. The day after the Brexit vote, the markets collapsed but I knew they'd shoot back up. (Don't ask me how I ""knew"", like I said I have zero knowledge of the stock market. It was a gut feeling) and snagged it at $45 a share. We all know how this stock turned out.

As of right now I have put in $950, and my portfolio is at $1092.

That is after a year and a half now? While it may not be the best, and stupid mistakes have kept me below the S&amp;P500, I am learning. I joined this sub to learn more and I'm sure it will greatly help me in class as well. I start class in the business college next semester and will be improving my grasp on how the stock market works hopefully.

But here is what I would do different for those who are starting out with $1000 or less.

Use Robinhood, you probably don't know much about all the information, charts, and news that are released on these higher end platforms. $5-$10 fees for every trade will eat you alive I promise it is not worth it. Stick with robinhood and just do a simple buy low sell high, or just hold it for a long time and reap the benefits from the dividends.

Don't use mutual funds, and try to stick with blue chip stocks or ETFs. I got lucky with Nvidia. I had no idea what their quarterly profits would look like. I just saw that they lost $20 on a financial meltdown and thought of it as a ""Black Friday"" deal. Blue chip stocks, and hold them forever. But diversification is key and with that I would recommend investing in ETF's. But don't forget to do your research. If you're not getting an ETF that follows an index, make sure you do a google search and see what companies they are investing in, see their dividend yield and check that this works out for you.

Of course this is probably not the best advice you will find here. I don't doubt that for a second. This is just how I have fallen and picked myself back up. I'm trying to learn hands on and I'd love for others to not make the same mistakes I did. Of course I'm only talking to those who are investing in the same budget as myself because with more money you'd be able to diversify a lot better or enter into mutual funds that are a lot more respectable.
