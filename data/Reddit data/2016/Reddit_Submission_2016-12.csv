Ergo, each day that passes is one day closer to the next recession, or even a depression. The federal reserve has been pumping and dumping the economy into states of boom and bust for a long time already, there's no reason here to expect they will not continue to do the same, perhaps even dump us into another great depression. 

My warning to the growing herd of perma-bulls would be to stop trying to time the market, and expect that they will know when to sell out their gains before stock prices come collapsing down. It never works. ",0

I am new to the whole trading scene and am curious what you guys think about the AMD stock. Personally, I believe the best way to learn is by incorporating other peoples opinions with my own. Anyways here's the backstory to why I am interested in the AMD stock. As a person who built his own computer 2 years ago, I continued to follow the buzz around new computer parts. This is where AMD comes into play. With the much anticipated release of Zen coming early next year, I'm making the assumption that this can drive up AMD's market presence, thus increasing it's stock price. Now i did more research than this, however I want to keep this post simple. Am I grossly naive or am I possibly on to something? Thanks for any responses in advance!",1

16-12-01,5ftr93,"NCIS YoY Data Breakdown. Relevant for gun and ammo stocks such as $SWHC (reporting tomorrow after close), $RGR, $VSTO, etc.","Being somewhat on the pulse of gun and ammo stocks, and being in a wonderful mood from getting home earlier than usual from work tonight, I decided to be a generous Jeebus and share some of my data tracking with you WerySpecialBoyz.  

If you don't know what NICS is or how it may be relevant to these stocks and you want to know more, please follow these instructions:  

1) Post a comment below asking what NICS is or how it may be relevant to these stocks  
2) Delete the comment  
3) Retire from the internet permanently--perhaps start a cult  

The 2015-2016 data are publicly available as one big ugly ass pdf with inconsistencies galore, so I cleaned it up and made visuals for my own tracking purposes. Enjoy, data nerds. Everybody else, I thought I saw a butterfly over there.  

[All states except Kentucky](http://imgur.com/a/e6cy9).  

I think my favorite element is the multi-month blip in ""modern sporting rifles"" after the Orlando shooting, visible in the right chart.

Why is Kentucky excluded, you ask? Well, take a look at [Kentucky](http://imgur.com/a/EGQPd).  

You see, as it turns out, people from Kentucky are pretty stupid. It also just so happens that the people representing Kentucky are from Kentucky. They seem to randomly decide to exclude their annual CCW re-checks (I guess?), which used to provide a consistent inflating effect to their report, and for some reason were never in the correct ""recheck"" section. We're talking about ~10%+ of the total US # of checks here, and Kentuckyans (Kentuckans?) are just mussing it all up. They cannot be trusted. If you see one in the wild, shoot on sight.  

That said, the Kentucky anomalies are actually supportive of the idea that the NICS totals being tossed around in the media are understated. If everyone is used to seeing inflated numbers and all of a sudden the state with the highest inflated total reports real numbers, the sales reality will be better than indicated by a relative comparison of totals.  

If you have any questions about the implications of these data visualizations, I do not have the answers. I mean, I might...but ain't nobody got time for plebs. In the case of SWHC earnings, I am personally rather conflicted about whether the recent quarter's presumed strong sales will offset the deflated short to medium term prospects of Hillary not being our holy lord and savior.  

If you all behave, I will refresh this when the latest November NICS data come out.  

It appears WSB took a skosh of a doody when I posted this two days ago. Fortunately, all mediocre things are worth the wait.

With legalization supposedly occurring next year (promised, but we'll see if it actually happens), I feel these stocks are only going to go up, and once it becomes legal nation wide, they could see a jump similar to Tesla. Specifically, I am looking at buying ACB tomorrow, and seeing what it does over the next month or so.

Recent correction in the stock after a long run. There is potential this correction could be due to Hatchimals inventories issues (out of stock leading into christmas). The amount of news coverage about these toys is insane, and Scalpers have taken a great opportunity to auction them off for Christmas, the amount of demand for these things is insane.

However, financials all look great, the company is increasing their EPS YoY by 50+%. The only thing I don't like to see is that Trade receivables amounts to almost half of the total assets, this is something I see with Hasbro also but with Hasbro it only represents ~30% of Total Assets.

The company has made some very smart plays such as teaming up with Cartoon Network to develop TV Shows based around character sets that they sell (ie. Paw Patrol) to open up other potential revenue streams with royalty fees.

Their current toy line is quite impressive, and I see these continue in popularity.

- Hatchimals
- Paw Patrol
- Meccano (which are actually pretty dope not gonna lie)
- Zoomer
- Air Hogs
- NASCAR

Personally, I think it is a good stock to go for, just wanted to hear your opinions too.

16-12-01,5fuwpv,Failing to realize cost of equity target has no consequences?,"Hi,

It appears to me that, theoretically, a publix firm is always better off to issue additional stock instead of debt. With debt, you will have to pay extra interest. With stock, you get cash and the only thing that happens is that shareholders see their voting rights and future value being diluted. Finance speaks of cost of equity, or the required return the shareholder expects to invest in the company. But even if the realized returns are much lower than the required return for consequent years, the stock price might still get a boost because of sudden new information with a large boost to expected future value as a result? Cost kf equity or realizing cost of equity makes no difference for a firm or its choice to issue debt or equity (perhaps the financing goal of firms is too issue equity and dilute shareholders as much as possible but not too much or it would cause significant reputation loss and therefore loss of future access to funds).

Some weeks pass and then they call me again, the Geely thing that was going to happen was delayed and they had a great deal for me to still make some money on the short term.
They would trade the Geely shares for shares in an unlisted company called ""Lithium Energy Technology HK"" (http://lithiumtechnology.net/) that would be listed around the end of the year at the HK market at a fixed price that would be significantly higher than the price they could buy them for.

That sounded ok, but now they told me the only way to make this deal was if they bought the whole block of shares and i needed to make an extra investment to get to that required level.
I looked up the company, it seemed legit, i asked them for their transfer agent (http://yanghow.com) and asked their transfer agent to confirm i had shares on my name pending payment.
Everything seemed fine so i decided to transfer the money to them.

The only thing that bugged me was that i couldn't verify the value of my shares in ""Lithium Energy Technology HK"". And i kept getting more doubts i would be ending up with worthless stock.

Next thing, i was being called that Orix Captial Trading was being merged with the much bigger company Sino Link Japan and i would now be their client. Nothing would change for me as i would contact the same people that were now moved to the offices of Sino Link Japan.
The person calling me also mentioned there was some progress with my shares and he would inform me about this in the coming weeks.

So i was called a couple of days later (two days ago), they had the possibility to sell my shares sooner and with more return than the fixed rate they talked about earlier. I would have all my money including profits back on my account in a couple of weeks.
There was only thing: I needed to make some additional investment to have enough shares in Lithium Energy Technology HK to be able to participate in the deal.

At this point i am almost certain i am being scammed. But i have too little knowledge about this business to be sure. I would love to hear some thoughts about my story.",2

•	What made you venture into equity crowdfunding?

•	On what basis did you choose your equity crowdfunding platform? 

•	How did you choose your investments?

•	Were you not scared that Startups have a high failure rate and you could lose every penny of your initial investment?

•	I know that Startup financials may not be transparent at times. Were you not scared as an investor that you had no in-depth auditing of what you were funding?

•	There is also a tenacity that estimated valuations on some startups might be wrong, meaning investments in them are priced at “estimated fair values.” These best-guess estimates may not reflect the actual amount that would be realized in a sale. How did you overcome this?

•	Did you prepare mentally, emotionally and financially to lose your entire investment in a particular funded startup?

16-12-01,5fwbzz,"$FNMA &amp; $FMCC - Best Execution Strategy &amp; a Crash Course in Capital Structure","Ladies &amp; Gentlemen -

Yesterday, /u/keepwinning provided you with an excellent thread on $FNMA. He also provided you with excellent DD 30 days ago. Had you followed his advice, you would have gained 150%. Over the last 30 days /u/keepwinning and I have had some excellent conversation on how to trade this.

In good /r/wallstreetbets fashion, no one followed his advice. Instead, /r/wallstreetbets waited for the news, a 40% one day gain to ask, ""Should I buy tomorrow at the open?""

I am hear to help answer that question for you by explaining [capital structure](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalstructure.asp) and best execution.

There are three types of equity securities with the GSEs. The Senior Preferred, Junior Preferred, and Common Stock (listed in order of hierarchy in the capital structure). If the common stock is worth $0.01 when the dust settles (Trump makes a deal or court rules favorably in one of the many cases) then the preferred is worth par value. The Senior Preferred is owned by the government along with warrants.

/u/keepwinning [post](http://imgur.com/a/KJfY8) shows he holds many of the preferred securities on $FNMA and $FMCC. The preferred securities offer a *safer* trade, with lots of upside and lots of room to exploit strange pricing differentials. 

I [sold out](http://imgur.com/a/25rGC) of the $FNMAS yesterday to move into the $FREJP.  The $FNMAS have a $25 par value while the $FREJP have a $50 par. The $FNMAS were trading at $8.29 while the $FREJP were trading at $11.25. I paid $3 for $25 more in upside. There are other reasons I am choosing to hold $FREJP over other preferred securities but that not relevant to this post.

I may look to consolidate my position further into $[FNMFO](http://www.quantumonline.com/search.cfm?tickersymbol=FNMFO&amp;sopt=symbol). This preferred security has a par value of $100,000, a redemption value of $105,000, and embedded call option for 1060.3329 shares. It trades between $20,000 and $25,000 (19% to 24% of redemption value). Comparing this to $FNMAS or $FREJP and we see that these trade at 33% and 22.3% of par, respectively.

Therefore, the question of to invest or not moves from, ""$FNMA or $FMCC between $4.00 and $6.00?"" to ""Is $FNMA and $FMCC worth at least $0.01? If so, what's the maximum upside across **all available securities**"".

We can discuss and debate what the best way to trade this is  but there are so many unknowns. What if the warrants are cancelled? Common Stock to $150. What if preferred stock is converted into common stock for a restructuring? Dilution of common but par value of preferred. What if...? What if...?

I have no probabilities to assign to this and that makes me want to move more into $FNMFO since I know the preferreds are ""money good"". I receive all of the benefits of the preferred security, have a redemption value larger than par, a 21.2% dividend yield (should this be restored), and an embedded call option (strike is really between $18 and $23 at this price point) should there be a massive move upwards.

You need to answer some of these questions for yourself to decide if you want to make the investment. Once you decide to make the leap then there are many ways to trade this event driven investment.

Last point to all the RH users... Was saving $7.95 on a trade worth missing out on a once in a generation trade? Move to a real broker. You will think through your buys and sells and can YOLO like a real WSB subscriber.

16-12-01,5fx13w,$NVDA pulling back. Wait until MACD reverses trend.,"$NVDA is finally pulling back, which is much overdue. The 26-day exponential moving average (EMA) line just crossed with the 12-day EMA.

This pullback is expected to last 10 days according to the history of $NVDA's chart, so around Dec. 10 may be a good time to get back in into $NVDA. 

That is not to say that this pullback may be short-lived.. I am just going by the chart. 

I expect most people to lock in profits while they can in the coming days. 

We will see $70~$75 by the time the next uptrend begins. This is because $NVDA stock underwent a range expansion from $68 to $88 on Nov. 10, which means a gap filling at $70~$75 is highly expected. 

I am NOT saying that $NVDA stock price will not see an increase tomorrow, because that is to be expected after a plunge down. However, the downtrend will persist for at least a weak, which means that the weekly chart will still show a significant plunge, since most days the stock will drop. Most investors don't understand this and only look at the ultra-short term. They are the ones who lose money. 

EDIT: $TSLA looks like it dropped through the $185 again. I see $TSLA heading towards $150 and poor sales from $TSLA (as indicated by a preliminary report released today) may be a risk factor for $NVDA. Sell NOW. ",11

Short of the CEO dying in the next 24 hours I'm pretty sure I'm screwed. I wanted to leave with a parting gift so you all can recover if you followed me with my terrible short:

$PIP is currently trading at $3.07. On 1/29/2017 they are paying out a special dividend of $2.91 per share. 

Strategy - buy 1000 shares of this company at $3.07. It will cost you $3070. Hold onto it until 1/29. On 1/29 you will get your dividend of 2.91 per share for a check of $2910. 

Sell the stock after the payout. As long as they stock is trading above $0.16 you will break even. 

If the stock is trading at let's say $1.00 after the dividend payout and you own 1000 shares you would sell those shares for $1000, you will have collected $2910 from the dividend payout. Total collected $3910. Total invested initially $3070. Profit: $840. Do this with $10,000 shares and your profit is $8400. If the stock trades at $2 after the dividend multiply your profit by 2. 

The only risk is if the stock trades for less than $0.16 after the dividend payout which I see as highly unlikely. Even if it trades at $0.10 after the payout and you owned $1000 shares you will lose $60 total on your $3070 investment. Again, nobody sees this happening.

You're welcome.

TLDR: buy $PIP and hold onto if until at least January 29th. ",17
16-12-01,5fxp34,Allergan a buy?,"Hello, so to be honest I don't understand the pharma companies to well, I think they are a little more complex then regular investments and am looking for help digging through the weeds.

My question is if the healthcare sector as a whole is overpriced, fair or on discount...and withen that sector is Allegan a good longterm holding which is currently on a a supreme discount to it's peers for speculation reasons based solely on fear of future drug pricing? ...Or is there a more substantial reason such as new competition, a decline in revenue or lack of future pipeline prospects?

Looking to hold long term and already invested in some healthcare index funds. However I want to focus some additional capital on the strongest pharma companies that are sure fire holds. You know like the GE of healthcare. Since allergan is vanguard healthcare funds top holding I figure allergen is one of those companies.

However it's down 25% since I made my initial purchase a few months back and I'm thinking if I should buy more.

Can someone help steer me in the right direction?

Some other companies I'm looking at are stz, and altria(I suspect altria and other dividend stocks are overpriced because of low bond yields). So I am looking for general sectors that aren't currently overpriced and companies withen that sector that are good longterm holdings.

# Description

Ford Motor Company (Ford) is a global automotive company. The Company's principal business includes designing, manufacturing, marketing, financing, and servicing a line of Ford cars, trucks, sports utility vehicles (SUVs), and electrified vehicles, as well as Lincoln luxury vehicles. 

Know we knew all that... but what about Ford really being 2 companies… a “bank” and a car company! 

## Recent financials 

Both sales and earning yo-yo like crazy. Making it really hard to judge the performance.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $150bn | $144bn | $147bn | $134bn | $136bn|
|EPS | $1.84 | $0.31 | $2.94 | $0.49 | $4.13|
|DPS | $0.60 | $0.50 | $0.40 | $0.15 | $0.05|

But worse, it's masking the underlying Automotive v Financial units.

|Automotive|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $141bn | $136bn | $139bn | $127bn | $128bn|
|Income pre-tax | $8bn | -$1bn | $13bn | $0bn | $1bn|

Where the automotive business swings wildly but the ""bank"" is stable.

|Financial|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $9bn | $8bn | $8bn | $7bn | $7bn|
|Income pre-tax | $2bn | $2bn | $2bn | $2bn | $2bn|

And how big is the ""bank"" v the car company?

|Automotive|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Assets | $92bn | $90bn | $91bn | $87bn | $79bn|
|Debt | $13bn | $14bn | $16bn | $14bn | $13bn|

Well, the bank is bigger in terms of balance sheet. Substantially. And it's the growing part of the balance sheet. which is odd given its profitability is flat, surely?

|Financial|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Assets | $137bn | $121bn | $115bn | $105bn | $101bn|
|Debt | $120bn | $105bn | $99bn | $91bn | $87bn|

## Competition

Even its competition commentary is weird. With the car industry getting almost no mention.

&gt; No single company is a dominant force in the automotive finance industry. Most of Ford Credit’s bank competitors in the United States use credit aggregation systems that permit dealers to send, through standardized systems, retail credit applications to multiple finance sources to evaluate financing options offered by these sources. Also, direct on-line or large dealer group financing options provide consumers with alternative finance sources and/or increased pricing transparency. All of these financing alternatives drive greater competition based on financing rates and terms. Competition from such institutions and alternative finance sources could adversely affect Ford Credit’s profitability and the volume of its retail business. In addition, Ford Credit may face increased competition on wholesale financing for Ford dealers.

Even so, it would be silly not to compare them. So here goes. Though margins are towards the bottom on the class :(

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Ford Motor Company | $153,397M | 8% | 27%
General Motors Company | $162,083M | 13% | 35%
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV | €110,595M | 7% | N/A
Toyota Motor Corp (ADR) | $252,787M | 16% | 14%
Honda Motor Co Ltd (ADR) | $124,687M | 9% | 6%
Volkswagen AG (ADR) | $226,740M | 17% | N/A
Ferrari NV | $3,209M | 26% | 23%
Tesla Motors Inc | $5,930M | 2% | -ve

## Cash / Debt?

Ford Motor Company has $103,059M of net debt. That is 8.8x it's latest operating profit. Which of course is a silly comparison given the debt levels of the car division are less than 10% of the overall. It's more like the car division is on 1x operating profit with the bank on 30x.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $12.72 for Ford Motor Company and their recommendation to clients is _Hold_. That implies an upside of 7% to their target.

# Valuation

Hold? For a stock on 7x earnings? Though hold on...6x for GM and 5x for FCUA? 

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/f/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
F | $47,367M | 7x | 2% | 7% | 10%
GM | $52,697M | 6x | 8% | 4% | 25%
FCHA.MI | €9,264M | 5x | 21% | 0% | N/A
TM | $198,037M | 11x | 2% | 4% | 19%
HMC | $53,524M | 11x | 21% | 3% | 21%
VLKAY.PK | $67,528M | 8x | 3% | 1% | 16%
RACE.K | $10,375M | 24x | 16% | 1% | 6%
TSLA.O | $30,538M | -ve | 35% | 0% | N/A

There is this weird rule of thumb I read many years ago that you sell the auto industry when it's on single digit valuation and buy when it's very high... sound upside-down? Well the logic is that it's a really cyclical business, so when it's cheap it's peak earnings and things are about to get nasty. When its really expensive it's usually cos it's making no moment, and the EPS is irrelevant!

So am scratching my head... do I just ignore the PE ratio and take comfort in the 7% dividend yield?

# Dividends

Ford Motor Company is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.84 per share, which compares to a forecast EPS of $1.81.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -5% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -4%. That's against a backdrop for the last 9 months of sales up 4%, earnings off 2%.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, the kept full year guidance as before, but they stressed that North America wasn't doing as well as hoped.

Is that the canary in the coal mine? Or shall we just clip the coupon...which at a 7% yield isn't something to sniff at!

16-12-01,5fzov4,Nitrogen Fertilizer DD,"Fellow Yacht-Hunters,

The current nitrogen fertilizer market is set for a rebound. North American fertilizer giants such as CF, POT, and YARIY are set to blow all other competitors out of the water. Asian manufacturers are struggling.

Since around 2013, various commodities in the nitrogen fertilizer market have dropped to multi-year lows. Specifics are Ammonia, UAN, and Urea. Many of these commodities have been finding a bottom due to various reasons. One, this is a very cyclical market, and two, Asian manufactures are facing between double and triple the production costs of north american manufactures. By mid 2017, Asian manufacturers will have negative margins if they continue to manufacture. CF, POT, and YARIY will all have margins above 50% from their current 30%. Not only that, but for the United States to meet demand of nitrogen fertilizer they need all companies to be operating at full capacity and STILL NEED ANOTHER 30% FROM EXPORTS. Hence, a massive imbalance of supply and demand will occur in late 2017 towards 2018. Chinese manufacturing will either be forced to operate and lose money or sit on the sidelines and see this commodity fly.

Currently, this is barely priced in, however I suspect it will begin to be priced in during 2017 (which isn't far away). If you have patience I could see these north american nitrogen fertilizer stocks rallying upwards of 100%. 

This shit won't happen overnight though. For further questions pm me.",21

""For example, if many orders are being filled on the “ask” side this might be an indication the stock is heading higher since buyers are clamoring to scoop up available shares at higher prices.

Conversely, if orders are consistently being filled on the “bid” side, it may be a warning sign that the stock is ready to fall given that sellers are willing to dump their shares at lower prices.""


What I don't understand is, isn't any order both satisfying both bid and ask ?? the price has to match , then both sides are happy. So, how do you know which side (bid or ask) is being fulfilled?

But they bought a lot of guns!

I'm trying to think of similar ways to exploit the Trump presidency. If their was a liberal achilles heal, like they were going to buy way more lattes I'd get Starbucks. But none seem to present themselves.

Since Trump denies climate change, you'd think coal and oil sectors would be a good bet, but I doubt it. Too many plants have gone to cheaper gas vs coal, and the fracking boom already took place and is still going on, so it's effects are known.

If he follows through on his promises, you'd think Trump would restrict foreign trade. But I'm not sure what sector would actually benefit from that. (And it probably won't happen anyway).

Any thoughts?",0
16-12-02,5g09o9,New Subreddit Idea - FundamentalInvestors,"So, this idea was thrown around awhile back, but I wanted to see what the interest would be in making it a reality. Basically, I was thinking we could have a subreddit along the same lines of /r/investmentclub, but more structured and (hopefully) active. 

Here's a list of things I'd like to do with this sub, all questions/criticisms/ideas are welcome:  
1) Have a dedicated mod team consisting of both users in the financial sector, users who are students of finance, and users who do it as a hobby (to diversify our portfolio, so to speak)  
2) To start with X dollars to invest as a subreddit and to vote on our investments

To go further in depth about the last point, I have a few ideas  
1. We, as a sub and team of mods, develop an investment strategy/thesis in terms of time horizon, objectives, risk tolerance, etc.  
2. Every post will be flaired. These flairs will either be (and I'm just spitballin here) ""Buy"" ""Sell"" ""Hold"" ""Sell Partial"" ""Macroeconomic Discussion"" ""News""  
3. At the end of each week, the top 10 suggestions will be voted on by the mod team as to whether or not to approve the decisions.

3) All of the analysis will be heavily based in fundamentals, with some allowance for technical analysis in terms of establishing buy points/possible sell points.

4) The aforementioned analyses will have a uniform structure that is tweakable. I'm thinking of something where we require a few points (like company history, recent news, valuation through a generally accepted method like a DDM or DCF) and then allow other points to be optional (like a management report, insider trading report, debt analysis, etc)

Obviously this is just a WiP, but I think it could be a lot of fun if managed correctly and would enhance the understanding for all involved of equity markets and investing. I don't want it to turn into WSB, and the format of selecting investments week to week helps to prevent that.

The stock price is already at 100% gain since yesterday, but I really think it has the potential to go higher. Around 1.4million shorts, and these news are pretty big due to two main factors:

- They can pay off their lawsuit and continue to operate without that dark cloud hanging over them.

-A huge company with a market cap of $27 billion thinks $NVCN's tech is worth their time and money. 

Unfortunately, I sold my shares (2,500) at $1.05 not long ago, so I have no position in $NVCN, and won't be taking one since I don't have any funds available and don't want to liquidate my other positions.

Also, it doesn't look like it can go much lower than it is now.

EPS = 3.68     
Estimated yearly growth = 8.9%

Revised Graham's formula = 120 CHF    
Operating margin = 15.4% higher than competitors      
ROE = 16.7% higher than competitors (but less than Unilever's)

Current ratio = 99.83% higher than competitors       
PE ratio = 18.55

Its profits went down in the past few years but it has been picking up and is forecast to go up in 2017 and 18.

Under a no vote, I expect this swing low to hold as a triple bottom. Will close yolo puts for a loss; I'll wait for a daily close above 103.50ish then go long FXE with my stop at 102.9ish. ",12

16-12-02,5g4hs4,"New job, retirement plan advice and critique","Cross posted to r/personalfinance as well, since I was unsure where this fits better

I recently started a new job this year after graduating college. I wanted to get started with my retirement planning so I decided to do the following:

Open Roth IRA

Open Roth 401k

Invest in ESPP for 10% of my income (at least for this quarter, could change this for other quarters. The rule is must wait 1 year to sell)

Save ~$400 this year (2016) in my HSA
  
Now, for the IRA my old plan was to invest purely in equity since I was thinking since I am 23 I can afford some risk early on. So I have an initial deposit into the IRA pending for 3k in VTSMX mutual fund. I was going to add 2.5k more by the end of the year and then repeat the same procedure next year for admiral shares. Then I could balance this risk later with ETFs in bonds, international stock, etc if I wanted to.

For the 401k I was going a similar route and put 6% earnings in at 51% VIIIX and 49% VEMPX (currently this is about $900 after the match)

However, after thinking about it should I have even bothered with VTSMX when I have VIIIX available in my 401k? is VIIIX strictly better, and furthermore since I can't get it on my own should my job change later then is getting as much VIIIX as possible the better option? Should I cancel the pending 3k VTSAX transaction?

Other notes:

Single

Live with parents

63k per year

In grad school (Computer Science, Computer Science BS finished)

Small student loan debt (2.3k at 3.6%)

No car payments

Work for very large company just outside the Fortune 100

VBMPX for bonds is available in the 401k, but there are no good low fee options available for international investments (to complete a 3 fund portfolio)

Any other advice is appreciated",2

# Description

Broadcom Limited is a semiconductor company. The Company offers a range of products in end-markets, including wired infrastructure, wireless communications, enterprise storage, and industrial and others. The Company's products are used in various applications, including data center networking, home connectivity, broadband access, telecommunications equipment, smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and displays. 

## Recent financials 

Given it's a merger, there aren't any official long term financials. And given they are in the process of [acquiring Brocade](http://investors.broadcom.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=203541&amp;p=irol-EventDetails&amp;EventId=5242448) too... it's going to get messier.

So let's look at the merger [presentation](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?t=1&amp;item=VHlwZT0yfFBhcmVudElEPTUyNDI0NDh8Q2hpbGRJRD02NTEyMDE=) and take management at their word.

|Pro-forma 2016 Estimate|Broadcom|Brocade|Combined|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $16.6bn | $1.4bn | $18.0bn |
|Gross Margin | 61% | 77% | 62% |
|Operating Profit | $6.8bn | $0.8bn | $7.6bn |
|Operating Margin | 41% | 58% | 42% |

They go on to suggest that they can do a top-line growth of 5% and are aiming to expand margins to 45%. Net net that would translate to approx 10% growth at the bottom line.

## Brocade deal

They expect the deal to close in the 2nd half of 2017. 

&gt; Acquiring Brocade, a leader in Fibre Channel storage area network (“FC SAN”) switching and IP Networking, for $5.9 billion. Broadcom to retain Brocade’s FC SAN Switching business and divest Brocade’s IP Networking business including Ruckus Wireless

Is Broadcom becoming the Oracle of the semi business? Rolling up the sector to embed themselves in the end-client base and then get pricing leverage?

## Competition

&gt; We compete with a number of major domestic and international suppliers of integrated circuits and related applications, including, but not limited to the following:

&gt; * Broadband and Connectivity: Intel; Marvell; Mediatek; Qualcomm; STMicro
&gt; * Infrastructure and Networking: Cavium; Freescale; Intel; Marvell; Mellanox

Though clearly it's Intel and Marvell that overlap the most.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Broadcom Ltd | $16,600M | 41% | -ve
Intel Corporation | $57,927M | 39% | 17%
Marvell Technology Group Ltd. | $2,458M | 4% | -ve
QUALCOMM, Inc. | $23,554M | 35% | 18%
STMicroelectronics NV (ADR) | $6,781M | 18% | 3%
Cavium Inc | $478M | -9% | -ve
Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. | $813M | 15% | 6%

On the face of it, they are doing well. In line with Intel and Qualcomm. Who couldn't be happy about that. 

## Cash / Debt?

Broadcom Ltd has $11,754M of net debt. That is 4x it's latest operating profit. Though in the Brocade deal presentation they forecast 2x by the time the deal closes.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $204.66 for Broadcom Ltd and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 26% to their target. Sweet!

# Valuation

And the valuation isn't wildly off Intel or Qualcomm's, so hard to worry about that. It doesn't feel impossible to see the sector re-rate, if there are some earnings surprises...

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/avgo.o/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
AVGO.O | $64,681M | 14x | 15% | 1% | 5%
INTC.O | $159,989M | 13x | 10% | 3% | 15%
MRVL.O | $7,158M | 24x | 22% | 2% | 3%
QCOM.O | $94,757M | 14x | 11% | 3% | 11%
STM | $9,074M | 41x | 39% | 3% | 14%
CAVM.O | $3,642M | 35x | 29% | 0% | 1%
MLNX.O | $1,937M | 11x | 19% | 0% | 7%

...though trimming forecasts has been the recent trend, not upgrades.

# Dividends

Broadcom Ltd is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.79 per share, which compares to a forecast EPS of $11.25. So plenty of room to pay off debts, keep up the M&amp;A and even do buybacks.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -6% that compares with no change in the earnings forecasts.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers they said

&gt; I would like to say it’s visibility to near-term projected demand remains very solid and we anticipate continued momentum into the fourth quarter. We expect the ramp in our wireless segment to drive consolidated revenue growth of 8% sequentially. We expect our operating leverage to drive earnings per share growth of 16% sequentially twice our projected revenue growth.

But when it came to the Brocade announcement

&gt; Broadcom Limited Affirms Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Guidance and Tightens Revenue to Upper End of Range. 

:) 

So given the potential revenues and cost synergies, still to gain from the original merger and now Brocade...I have to admit to be tempted...especially since it's traded between 12 and 16x and today it's in the middle of the range.

Hi Friends,

I’m writing this letter to you because I’ve identified you as someone who is or may be interested in learning more about long-term investing. I have too many friends who have decided that investing is too complex for them, and they either write off investing altogether or pay a mutual fund company thousands of dollars in fees over their lifetime. I have spent the past several years reading everything I can and teaching myself how to be a successful investor. I’m still very much an idiot, but I realize that my knowledge today can help you make better investment decisions for your future. 

*Someone’s sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago*. – Warren Buffett

I’d like to start with an introduction about my investing style.

***Dividend Value Investing***

*Time is the friend of the wonderful company, the enemy of the mediocre.* – Warren Buffett

My investing style closely resembles the value investing style espoused by Warren Buffett mixed with a heavy emphasis on dividends. Value investing is characterized by buying high quality, dividend paying companies at reasonable prices.  

How do I ensure a company is high-quality? A high-quality company will have a wide moat, meaning other companies will have a tough time gaining market share from the wide-moat company. An example of a company with a wide moat is Union Pacific Railroad. It is tough if not impossible for a company to come in, buy land, gain permits, purchase cars, and start laying tracks.

 I favor boring companies who sell products people will continue to buy 25+ years in the future. People will still need toothpaste, band-aids, and water 30 years from now. 

 I like companies that generate lots of cash each quarter. High quality companies exhibit stable, 10+ year trends of increasing earnings per share (EPS).  These companies should have management which uses this cash to make strategic acquisitions or returns this capital to shareholders via dividends (preferably both). 

Specific metrics I use to make sure a company is high-quality:

* **Dividend Yield &gt; 2%** – This is how much the money you invest in a company will earn via dividends throughout the year. I like companies with a greater dividend yield than the general market. The sweet spot for dividend yield range tends to be 2.4-5%. Dividends are passive income currently taxed at a 15% rate.
* **Payout Ratio &lt;70%** - Tells how much of a company’s earnings are currently being paid out via dividends. I want to ensure a company can continue to increase their dividend without eroding earnings.
*** Return on Equity  (5 year median) &gt; 10%** - This formula tells how much net income is returned as a percentage of shareholders equity.  This formula is used to measure management’s effectiveness of using shareholder’s capital to generate earnings. High return on equity = high quality management.
* **Earnings Per Share (10 year growth) &gt; 10** -  This shows on average how much a company increases its growth rate by over 10 years. I like to see companies who have weathered 10 years of the economic cycle, and still have managed to grow earnings by 10% on average. 
* **Debt to equity ratio &lt;.55** – Debt to equity ratio is a measure financial leverage. It calculates a company’s total liabilities and divides it by shareholder’s equity. The lower the number the better as it means a company isn’t using debt to finance its assets. A low debt level ensures a company can withstand an economic downturn.

***Margin of Safety***

*Rule #1: Don’t lose money. Rule #2: Don’t forget rule #1* – Warren Buffett

Warren Buffett talks about ensuring your investments have “a high margin of safety”. Margin of safety is ensured by making sure the companies you are buying are undervalued, and able to withstand deteriorating market conditions. 
 
An undervalued company is not likely to go down as much during a recession as a highly valued, growth company. Investors get greedy during bull markets. Stocks like Netflix, Amazon, and Tesla get bid up on the expectation that money will keep flowing, and growth will continue forever in the double digits. In a recession, these high growth stocks drop the fastest and hardest. You instead want companies whose value metrics are relatively lower than the general market, as these companies offer safety in case the 7 year bull run goes the other way. 

Specific metrics I look at to check if a company is undervalued are:
 
* **PE (Price to Earnings Ratio) &lt; market’s average** – Price to earnings measures the price of the stock divided by the earnings per share. This is a basic way to see how a stock is being valued compared to its past. I look at the forward PE because it takes the current price divided by the future year’s earnings estimates. This ratio provides a way to see what a company’s PE will look like if they meet their earnings estimates. 
* **PE&lt; 10 year median PE** – A good way to check how PE compares to historical PE for the company
* **PS (Price to Sales Ratio) &lt; 10 year PS** – Measures current price of stock to current sales. This compares to the historical PS average. 
* **PB (Price to Book Ratio) &lt; 10 year PB** – Measures the price of the stock divided by the book value of the company. This compares to the historical PB ratio.
* **PE &lt; Industry Avg PE** – We want the PE of the stock to ideally be lower than its industry’s PE. Certain industries will usually have a higher PE. Technology companies will usually have higher PE than a paper company.
* **EPS 10 year chart** A favorite method of mine to see if a company is undervalued is comparing the 10 year chart of a company’s stock price, with the 10 year earnings per share (EPS) overlayed. When the EPS is rising , and the share price is down, it’s a good indicator that shares are undervalued. This method was popularized in the book, Purple Chips.

***Dividend Growth***

*Compound interest is the 8th wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it…he who doesn’t pays it* –Albert Einstein

When I buy stock in a company, I plan on holding it long term, ideally 20+ years. It’s important to me that a business/company can do well in recessions and bull markets. Slow and steady growth is the name of the game. Dividend growth is extremely important to me. Dividends have accounted for 30% of stock returns over the past 80 years. When management raises the dividend, it is the ultimate signal that management is confident earnings will continue to grow. Dividends cannot be fudged on accounting statements. The money is paid directly to you quarterly, and will be taxed at a 15% rate. 

If I buy a company currently yielding 5%, and it raises their dividend 10% every year, after 10 years I will be earning a 10% yield on my original investment, and this doesn’t include any stock price appreciation. Earning 10% on your money is unbeatable, even in a high-interest environment. My goal is to generate $80,000 in passive income via dividends to draw upon for retirement by 2036. 

***Market Timing &amp; Greed***

*Time in the market beats timing the market.*

*Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful* – Warren Buffett

The biggest mistake people make with investing is letting their emotions of fear and greed interferes with sticking to a sound investment philosophy. Wall Street makes billions each year off naïve investors buying at the top, and then selling when things look like there is no hope.
  
The fact is the stock market is wildly unpredictable. Like a manic-depressive person, no one truly ever knows whether the market will go up or down. By investing in solid companies that pay dividends, you will make money no matter which way the market decides to go. It helps if your retirement date is 10+ years out. Time is on your side. You can withstand paper losses that recessions will bring. Don’t sell and keep reinvesting your dividends and extra capital. Slow and steady will win the race, and you will be rewarded for your patience and steady emotions.

*Over the long term, the stock market news will be good. In the 20th century, the United States endured two world wars and other traumatic and expensive military conflicts; the Depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics; oil shocks; a fly epidemic; and the resignation of a disgraced president. Yet the Dow rose from 66 to 11,497*- Warren Buffett

***Companies I am Buying or Adding to My Positon:***

In order of largest to smallest holding percentage:

* 1. **Johnson &amp; Johnson - JNJ**

My largest holding. JNJ is a diversified healthcare company. You probably know them for their consumer health business where they make band-aids, baby shampoo, and Tylenol. Their other 2 businesses include medical devices and their fastest growing-pharmaceuticals. JNJ has raised their dividend for 54 straight years. Their management is top-notch, and they are approaching a reasonable PE ratio of around 19. 

*  2.**Lockheed Martin – LMT**

Lockheed Martin is an aerospace and defense company who sells stealth jets, missile and radar systems, and space flight vehicles. Their customers are primarily the US government and its NATO allies. Lockheed’s price has increased recently with Trump and Republicans winning. People expect the US military to increase spending over the next 4 years. Lockheed pays a nice dividend of 2.8%. Management has grown profits very well over the past 10 years. Do I feel scummy investing in the military industrial complex? Sometimes. I also think there are a lot of bad people out there, and we need advanced weaponry to provide a deterrent against them. I expect Lockheed to do extremely well as governments continue to upgrade against global terrorism. 

* 3.**Royal Dutch Shell – RDS.B**

Royal Dutch Shell is an energy company selling oil, natural gas, and renewables. Like most energy companies, their prices has dropped significantly since the price of oil dropped from $100 to its current $50 a barrel. Shell has been moving away from oil, and recently spent $50 billion to acquire BG Group, the largest natural gas supplier. Shell’s dividend is currently 7%, and they are committed to paying it throughout this oil downturn. Oil may not reach $100 a barrel, but OPEC will not let oil continue to decline as it has over the past year. Since I wrote this, OPEC announced production cuts so that oil-dependent countries like Russia, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia can stop losing billions of dollars each year. Shell is paying you 7% to wait out this oil decline. The world will continue to need more energy, which is why I am adding to my holding. 

* 4.**Welltower – HCN**

Welltower is a healthcare Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) that buys and manages senior housing, post acute care, and assisted living centers. REIT’s are required to pay out 90% of its profits in dividends, which is why Welltower is currently yielding 5.5%. Baby boomers are just at the beginning of retiring en masse. Anyone with an older relative realizes how important and necessary senior living centers are. Welltower has been paying dividends for 30+ years. I like Welltower as a stable income producing company who will experience growth for the next 10-20 years as people continue to get old, live longer, and utilize senior housing.

* 5.**Cisco – CSCO**

Cisco designs, manufactures, and sells Internet based networking products and services. Their bread and butter are data center and enterprise switches, routers, conferencing systems, and their fast-growing cyber security businesses. They are the market leader in helping computers talk with one another. Cisco current trades at a 12 forward PE, which is significantly lower than the general market’s PE of 20. Their PE and price to sales numbers are currently lower than their 5 and 10 year medians. Cisco has a great CEO in John Chambers. They have an operating margin of 25% and current free cash flow of 12b. Their dividend is a solid 3.5%. This is a great tech company to buy and hold.

* 6.**International Business Machines – IBM**

IBM is considered a dinosaur in the tech world, and some people foolishly write them off because of this. IBM is in the middle of a multi-year transformation away from traditional businesses like software and IT outsourcing to their “strategic imperative” businesses of big data &amp; analytics, cloud mobile, and social/security. More recently, IBM has developed the AI technology, Watson. You may have seen Watson win the show Jeopardy a few years back. IBM has a low PE, huge cash reserves, and excellent returns on assets/equity. IBM has transformed itself multiple times in its 100+ year history. I will collect their 3.5% dividend yield as they do it again.

* 7.**Abbvie Pharmaceuticals – ABBV**

Abbvie is a research based company focusing on treating conditions such as Parkinson’s, HIV, cancer, dermatology, cystic fibrosis, and other conditions. Abbvie was spun off from the blue chip, Abbot Labs, in 2012. Abbvie’s stock price has remained stagnant over the past year as concerns about its top selling drug, Humira’s, patents due to expire. Humira makes up 60% of Abbvie’s sales. Abbvie has lawyers upon lawyers to postpone the expiration of its patent. I believe there is too much pessimism about Abbvie’s future earnings dropping. They trade at a forward PE of 12 compare to the industry average of 22. They have a return on equity and assets of 118% and 10% respectively. Management raised the dividend last month signaling they expect Abbvie’s earnings to continue to grow. They have a 5 year dividend growth rate of over 40%. Abbvie is a rare chance own a great pharma company while collecting a 4.3% dividend yield.

* 8.**Union Pacific Railways – UNP**

Who wants to own a railroad in 2016? Union Pacific runs several railways in the Western United States. These railways primarily ship coal, chemicals, and industrial products (do you know a President elect who like coal and building steel walls?). They have a duopoly with Burlington Santa Fe allowing them to command a 37% operating margin. They have grown their income 16% yearly over the past 10 years. Their dividend is currently 2.3%, but they have grown that dividend 16% over the past 5 years.  Union Pacific has an extremely wide moat. I used to think of railways as inefficient and non-environmentally friendly. Did you know railways can move freight 436 miles on one gallon of fuel. Try doing that in a semi or 747. 

* 9.**John Deere and Co – DE**

John Deere is known for their big green tractors, but they also sell dump trucks, loaders, excavators, and anything else to help farmers get better yields. We are currently in the middle of a 5 year lull in corn prices. When corn prices pick up, this gives farmers more money to upgrade their equipment. Deere is an extremely cyclical company, and their price has increased much in the past year as people expect corn prices to rebound. I’d wait for a pullback to initiate a position in them. Still they have an excellent brand, with a long history of rewarding shareholders. They currently yield 2.6% and are increasing their dividend 11% on a yearly average over the past 5 years.

* 10.**Novo Nordisk – NVO**

Novo Nordisk is a healthcare company whose two main businesses are diabetes and obesity care. I hope to never have to utilize their drugs and services, but I also understand I’m in the minority. Most people in the US and world are getting fatter. We rely on cars for transportation, sit at desks 8+ hours a day, and are too lazy to exercise. Even worse we have super cheap junk food at our fingertips 24/7. This trend is only continuing as billions of people in China and India enter the “modern world”. Sounds bleak, but don’t worry, Novo Nordisk is there to get you your insulin and diabetes devices. They are also involved with hormone replacement therapy products. Novo has sold off 40% this year over concerns of drug pricing pressure in the United States. They are at a 52 week low. They generate tons of money, yield 2.6%, and are trading at historic lows. 

* 11.**Cummins– CMI**

Cummins designs, manufactures, and distributes diesel and natural gas engines. They have a free cash flow of 1.5b, a forward PE of 14, and have grown earnings by 10% each year over the past 5 years. They currently yield 3%, with a long history of paying/increasing dividends. They have a strong brand in a great niche market. 


* 12.**Schweitzer-Mauduit International – SWM**

This is a new holding for me. SWM is a paper and plastics company. 60% of their business is in producing cigarette papers. Governments around the world mandate cigarette companies use their Lower Ignition Prospensity (LIP) papers. These papers ensure cigarettes do not light on fire when dropped to the ground. This business is slowing as cigarette consumption drops around the world. In 2012, new management came in and changed their strategy to diversify their business away from cigarette papers. They now make water filtration systems, tea bags, and other specialty products. The transformation is working as net income has grown 18% each year over the past 5 years. They have a return on equity /assets of 17 and 8%. Operating margin of 15%, and a forward PE of 12. Their debt to equity ratio is a little high at .51, but management is committed to paying down debt from their recent acquisitions. Even better their dividend yields 4%, and has grown 11% per year over the past 5 years. An upcoming catalyst for them could be selling papers to the marijuana industry. More states and countries countinue to legalize marijuana. These sales can help offset the decline of their cigarette business.  


* 13.**TD Bank – TD**

TD Bank is headquartered in Toronto, Canada. They have a great steady business with management that pays a dividend yield of 3.5%. Canadian banks are more steady growers than their riskier US counterparts. TD Bank has room to continue growing their earnings and dividend.

* 14.**Visa – V**

Visa is an anomaly in my portfolio. They trade at a high PE (29) and pay a paltry dividend (.86%). Visa is a growth stock. Visa runs the world’s largest payment network. They do not assume any of the responsibilities with fraud or credit card debt. They just collect their 2.5% on every transaction made when someone uses a card with Visa on it. The world will continue to use less cash as e-commerce grows. Visa has rarely traded at a reasonable PE ratio. This is mostly due to their incredible business. They have an operating margin of 65% with no signs on this slowing down.

* 15.**T Rowe Price – TROW**

T Rowe Price provides financial advice and mutual funds. They have grown their dividend 27 years in a row, and currently yield 2.9%. They are currently trading at a forward PE of 16 compared to their 10 year median of 24. Their business and management is truly a blue-chip. They have a return on equity/assets of 24 and 18%, showing that they can invest in themselves and make money. 

* 16.**Boeing – BA**

Boeing’s businesses are airplanes and defense. They are trading at a forward PE of 20.55 compared to a 10 year median of 28. They have 8.4b in free cash flow. Their dividend yield 3%. Their net income and dividends continue to grow. This a blue chip with a wide moat, and 42 years of dividend increases.

* 17.**Tesoro– TSO**

Tesoro refines petroleum and bio-fuel products. They also have a great gas station retail business. More and more Americans continue to drive, especially in the Western States where Tesoro operates. They have made strategic acquisitions that will allow them to continue paying a decent dividend (2.5%) and increasing their income. 

 
* 18.**Walmart – WMT**

Walmart is like IBM in that they are in the middle of a huge transformation, and they have a very, very long history of making successful transitions They were a little late to e-commerce, but concerns about Amazon taking them over were overdone. They have a huge transportation and logistics advantage over every retailer in the world. Their low price model has proven successful in China, Mexico, and India. They have made huge investments in e-commerce to compete with Amazon in the United States. At a PE of 15, and dividend growth for 41+ years, Walmart is still a bargain.

* 19.**Western Digital – WDC**

Western digital sells storage hard drives and solid state drives. Their business will continue to grow as more storage is needed for all of the pictures, videos, and data we continue to share. Their forward PE is 9, dividend yield of 3.4%. This is a great tech company that will reap the benefits from their aqusition of Sandisk.

* 20.**Nike – NKE**

Nike has been my worst performer over the past year (down 16%). Their PE has gone from 30 to 22, highlighting why it’s never good to pay a premium, especially in retail. I still think Nike has a bright future, and this is as good a time as any to buy part of the company. Their dividend was increased so that they yield 1.5%. If you have traveled overseas, you know how popular the brand is abroad. They still dominate in shoe sales. They own the brands converse, who’s Chuck Taylors remain popular. Athletic wear is a fast growing market. They recently announced their $700 self-lacing shoe called the HyperAdapt which has been sold out everywhere, and are currently being sold for $5000+ on ebay. I don’t like retail stocks, but Nike and VFC are the only companies in the space I would consider owning.


There you have it friends. I’d like to continue writing a letter like this once a year.

16-12-02,5g48sg,distribution yield vs. average yield,"For the ETF fund HYXU, the distribution yield is 1.22%. The average yield is 3.90%. 

My current understanding, is that the average yield represents the cashflow paid to the ETF by the individual bonds, divided by the weighted average price of the underlying bonds, i.e. it's the weighted average yield of the ETF's underlying holdings. 

The distribution yield is obviously what is paid to the investors divided by the current price of the ETF.

My question is, why are these (distribution vs. average) so radically different in this case? I would have expected them to be similar (minus fees of course), i.e. the average weighted yield of the underlying holdings would be roughly equal to the yield of the distributions

There is no option to directly convert it (as there is for doing the opposite), so I would have to sell the shares and re-purchase (triggering taxable events since this is in a taxable account).

My question is -- is there any reason to *want* to do this? The ETF tracks the same index and the fees appear to be equivalent, so the only benefit I can see is the option to purchase fractional shares. Perhaps the bid/ask spread for purchasing individual ETFs is costing me a bit more fees in the long run, but I'm not certain of this.

When I go to set limit price it states .05 increments only then shows last sale as .32.  What am I missing?

I bought ten contracts for .30 each.  Stock dropped a few cents after I bought it and my contracts went up to .35.  Next day, 49 days out from expiry the stock drops by ten percent and my puts are now worth .32.  I assume that's supply and demand and the market doing what it wants.",5

I noticed it first when I visited Opteck.com. Under the top tab, ""Accounts"" they have a choice for an ""[Islamic Account](https://www.opteck.com/accounts/islamic-account/)""

At the bottom of the page there's a Halal sticker! Apparently they have certain conditions to their accounts. I believe they get benefits others don't. Didn't look too into it.

I was intrigued and googled ""[Islamic Trading](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=islamic%20trading)"".

[This link](http://www.anyoption.com/islamic-trading) even mentions they are ""Shariah Compliant"".

Since I saw the Halal logo on Opteck I decided to google ""[Is trading Halal in Islam?](https://www.google.com/search?espv=2&amp;biw=1286&amp;bih=676&amp;q=is+trading+halal+in+islam&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtvMvJz9bQAhVHwlQKHeaKDxkQ1QIIZigE)""

That led me to a video titled ""Dr Zakir Naik - Stock Market Halal or Haram?"" I did not watch it, but I was curious and googled to learn more about ""[halal vs haram](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=halal%20vs%20haram)"".

Apparently, ""It is one of five Ahkam—fard (compulsory), mustahabb (recommended), halal (allowed), makruh (disliked), haram (forbidden)—that define the morality of human action in Islam. Mubah is also used to mean ""permissible"" or ""allowed"" in Islam.""

In regards to the argument that the ""lender"" is happy that they lent out the stock and gained interest $ because they would have ended up with the closing decreased value of anyway and can take back the stock anytime they want to during the lending period, don't most brokers not do this because its ""bad"" business?

16-12-03,5g9b59,"Does active management work? I read the academic literature so you didn't have to | Spoiler: no","TL;DR: [no.](http://imgur.com/a/dfhlR) 

Longer TL;DR: Active management in the aggregate doesn't generate market beating returns. An edge may exist but fees wipe it out. There are uses for active funds. 

***


I wrote this as a comment reply but figured it deserve a thread. We've known this for some time. There are ways to generate market-beating return, and ways to use information advantages to beat the index, but in general, management fees eat into this so much that returns are negative relative to the market. This is *very well documented* in the academic literature.

Based on statistical distributions, you'd expect that some funds would beat the market. That's not evidence that they're necessarily better; that's just a normal distribution. There are some market beating managers, but those funds aren't typically available to retail investors. Also, you can't predict which manager will beat the market based on their previous fund performance. 

As Upton Sinclair said, ""It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it."" 

The active management industry is premised on the ability of managers to generate market-beating returns. It's overly saturated, and that's why passive investing is gaining market share. That said, active management *does* have uses. Cheap diversification, access to different asset classes, dividend policy. I'm not saying it shouldn't be used. It's just that aggregate data from the last few decades shows us that the returns don't justify the fees. Simple as that. 

*** 

Some reading: 

Elton, Gruber and Blake (1996): find that including failed funds in an analysis (accounting for survivorship bias) can lower performance up to 0.50% per year.  

Goetzmann and Zheng (2006) study a portfolio of funds for 43 years, including survivors and non survivors. They estimate the Alpha with a 3 factor model and find that it is -1.92% per year for the value-weighted portfolio. (that means they underperform the market index [s&amp;p500] by 1.92% /year. 

The Alpha of the equally-weighted portfolio is -0.12% per year.

Elton, Gruber, Das, and Hlavka (1993) find underperformance of 1.6%.

Brown and Goetzmann (1995) find little evidence of underperformance.

Malkiel (1995) report modest underperformance of active mutual funds.

Carhart (1997) assemble the most complete sample available at the time that was mostly free of survivorship bias. He finds an underperformance of 2% per year and concludes that “the results do not support the existence of skilled or informed mutual fund portfolio managers"".

[Here's a summary of the academic literature to determine average performance relative to the market index of mutual funds.](http://imgur.com/a/ROn7a) This isn't saying that their average performance was negative in absolute terms, just that the fees and performance added together mean investors would have been x% better off investing in the market index. 

Can active managers time the market? [The academic literature is mixed.](http://imgur.com/a/Bhuu2)

I'd be interested to hear your thoughts about the uses of active management. It's still responsible for ~80% of investment in the US. I personally don't invest in any pure active funds, although I do have holdings in some smart beta and index funds with fairly high cost bases. ",10

- PE &lt; 23
- Yield &gt; 3.5%
- Increasing dividend for 10years+
- Increasing EPS

Each position is market cap weighted. Net yield is ~4.7%.

| Ticker | Name | Yield % | Weight % |

For all of you wondering where on earth that $10b in R&amp;D was going... it may not be a bottomless hole after all. 

&gt; Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has sent a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) acknowledging that it is working on self-driving cars. The letter requests that NHTSA facilitate testing of self-driving development vehicles on public roads, as well as provide standards for data sharing and privacy.

The article also comes with this [sweet concept image](https://staticseekingalpha.a.ssl.fastly.net/uploads/2016/12/3/6965821-14807857711475525_origin.png), which I presume is a complete work of fiction. 

How would you rate Apple's chances of bringing a self-driving car to market? Better or worse than conventional automakers? Tesla? Uber? 

I expect they'll get a small bump from this, although sentiment around AAPL has been very negative recently, and investors might be waiting to see if this actually comes to fruition.

[Here's a link to Apple's letter to the NHTSA.](https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=NHTSA-2016-0090-1115)",1
16-12-03,5g9w1d,Where is your money?,"Dear Reddit Community, 

Let this question be interpreted in two ways;
This question is inquisitive. I am genuinely curious, what industries does this community tend to commit to? Are we currently interested in certain areas more than others? Are there specific subsections of an industry that you truly believe in? Small Cap or Large Cap? ETFs, Mutual Funds? Are you interested in value or growth?

In it's second sense, this question is also rhetorical. By this I mean; Do you know where your money in the social world. By way of investments you have the capacity to enable and influence industries. Do you even care what the business you are supporting does socially if it is making money? Are you supporting a company that is committed to sustainable development or one that ignores basic civil rights, or is not concerned with slave or child labor outside of its own business walls? Much more to question here as well. 


For example. I am invested in Amazon, Google, Nasdaq 100 Composite, and a World Growth Fund. I genuinely have not the slightest idea of what positive and negative impacts in the world that I am support. For anything beneficial or progressive that I support by way of my investments, I am proud, but of any malicious or oppressive support, I am remorseful. As the drivers of this economy we, the investors, have the ability to hold business accountable. In your honest opinion, do you feel the need to be a socially responsible investor? 


tldr: 
Like legit what companies are you invested in? 
Do you understand what these companies support through their business or philanthropy? Do you care?
Do you feel obligated to invest in a socially responsible way?

I'm hoping, for my portfolio's sake, that the likely rate hike is largely priced in to my holdings already.  I do have a suspicion that some companies that are ripe for a buyout will begin getting snapped up.  

Big players in some industries are hitting a wall on growth (see CSCO), but have enormous cash reserves (again, see CSCO).  The cost of acquisitions is going to go up as the days of cheap money are coming to an end, and the trend is expected to reverse as the incoming pres has called foul on the Feds keeping rates so low for so long.

I believe we'll see a run of acquisitions in the next 4 months.  Top targets?  I don't know.  Fireeye is looking really cheap right now, for one.  It's in a sector I follow very closely.  PANW... not sure if it's a target or an acquirer.  Valuation is super high.  However, they're currently light on debt.  Would have to stretch to raise enough capital to gobble up companies worth buying.

Or perhaps, I'm way off base here... Thoughts?",11

16-12-03,5gajj9,$AGNC a study in getting paid monthly while reducing cost basis. DD inside.,"To get you up hethens to speed AGNC has a monthly dividend with an annualized yield of almost 12%. The idea is to sell calls against it and either roll them early to avoid an early call or let them expire OTM, depending on each months parity.

First off let's figure out what were looking at. AGNC is a Real estate investment trust which holds mortgage backed securities, the notes and their monthly payments are backed by the government through GNMA and FNMA (not Fannie, calm your tits). To keep its tax status it has to payout over 90% of its eps(1.51 as of 9-30-2016) each month. [Here is the prospectus](http://ir.agnc.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=219916&amp;p=irol-dividends).

This is the most option liquid underlying I could find with a monthly dividend to perform this study with.  This will work with any decent underlying, I picked this one for its high yield, relative liquidity, healthy volatility and RSI.

The play: minimum purchase is 100 shares to cover the call so let's work off of this. You can scale up from here. Initial investment $1790 will net you $18 monthly(apx. 12% annual yield).  Ex. Div. dates for AGNC traditionally fall on or around the 27th of the month. Volatility sits at 22 making the Jan 20, 18 call sell for $36. Now American style options attempt to price in the dividend ahead of time because of early excersice. You can see the difference to get a feel if it's going to get called early by the put/call parity and the expected dividend amount.

The goal is to capture 50% of the option premium and the dividend each month.  If called early sell the closest put and collect some nice theta decay in the meantime since you will be near the end of the puts contract then wait until after the ex. div. date to re-enter once the stocks price corrects.

The best case scenario would be to buy at 17.90, sell the Jan-20 18 call for 36 and have the underlying go ITM for $10 plus the call premuim for apx $46 profit, fuck the dividend. Rinse and repeat.

Scenario B is the same setup, close the call for $18 profit and collect the $18 dividend doubling your annualized yield to almost 24%.

Scenario C, same set up but the underlying gets called early for a small profit, sell the put and collect premium until you close early or safely expire OTM then re enter the underlying after the ex div date.

Scenario D is the call expires far enough OTM to not get called for the dividend and you reduced your costs basis on an underlying losing value and still get the div.

RSI is at 26.8 suggesting it's oversold and may be signaling a buy opportunity pattern starting.

Do your own DD before entering any position because for all you know I may be talking out of my asshole, oh and I wrote this up on mobile so you animals better appreciate it.

Edit: The idea of going through all this trouble instead of just playing the option game outright for around the same potential gains is that 50% of the max potential monthly profit is guaranteed with the dividend but not with the call alone.",6

Since I love to lose money with you lot, I decided to do a little bit of detective work with a spreadsheet. 

https://imgur.com/a/c0fyQ

Basically I looked up all the preferred shares from F&amp;F listed on OTC Market, their par values and their current price, then I divide the current price by the par value to get the ""on the dollar"" amount. I also looked up the volume to get an idea of the liquidity.

The discount ranges from ¢23 to ¢35 on the dollar. Based on that, it looks like FMCCI and FMCKP offer both good discount and good amount of liquidity.

So as it says, I am looking maybe for a more professional broker. I am just really worried about fees. Right now, I am on robinhood. I know people hate trading on robinhood with a decent amount of money, but so far, I am absolutely loving it. Execution is good enough, as I am making money on very quick 10 -30 second trades, and I have saved thousands in fees. Ive heard things about brokerages that give you lower rates if you have a larger amount and make a lot of trades, and would just love to hear what people in similar situations to me use.

16-12-03,5gcew1,Asset allocation in parallel with asset location,"Everywhere I read (such as https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax-efficient_fund_placement) I hear that we should allocate assets (decide on a portfolio) before locating assets (Roth vs 401k vs taxable). We can view asset allocation as a mathematical optimization to create the most profitable risk/reward ratio, and view asset location as optimizing to find the most efficient placement of these assets. Mathematically, passing the output of one optimization into another will lead to less optimal results than optimizing both simultaneously. So why don't we just allocate in parallel with location. In practical terms, why couldn't we say things like: because I have a relatively large Roth Balance, Bonds are better for my portfolio than stocks, marginally.

16-12-04,5gclgq,Niobium Mines (speculative),"First, a little background on Niobium

 http://www.cradleresources.com.au/projects/what-is-niobium/

 So, it makes steel stronger, there's not alot of mines,  and out of the 3 mines  that exist, one of them dominates the market and is located in Brazil.

  There's 2 companies that I think have promise in the next few years,especially if trump's infrastructure plan boosts the American steel industry. 90% of niobium mined goes into steel.

A) $NIOBF Niocorp owns land and mineral rights for the Elk Creek project in Nebraska. Would be the only niobium mine in the u.s. Would also be the only Scandium mine in the US. Steelmaker ThyssenKrupp has already stated they would buy half of the nibium this mine produces. Just got Army Corp of Engineers Jurisdictional Determination approval in Sept. The community surrounding the mine seems to be all for it from what I've read.  Company is doing a webcast in a couple days with an update on this project. 

B)$TGB Taseko mines. Aley Project in British Cokumbia. 
 https://www.tasekomines.com/properties/aley/project-summary
  Will produce a shit ton of Niobium, but the real speculative play is their proposed copper-gold mine called New Prosperity. Will be one of the largest copper-gold mines in Canada. They've ran into a ton of issues getting environmental approval to open this mine. Locals and Aboroginals are not happy with how this mine will affect some ""sacred"" lake nearby. But! there is a possible catalyst coming, recently they have threatened to sue if the EAO doesn't get their ass in gear to reamend their Environmental Certificate, they sent a strongly worded letter, and it worked.

 https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/no-guarantee-taseko-mine-in-bc-will-be-approved/article33012320/?ref=http://www.theglobeandmail.com&amp;service=mobile
  I doubt this mine will get opened but if they get a new Environmental Certificate  it should bump the price up pretty good.

16-12-04,5ge0rw,"The ""free dividends fallacy"" is a belief that seemingly runs rampant in this sub. It's high time we took a closer look at whether investing in high dividend paying stocks makes sense.","**Posts in /r/investing regularly advocate buying high dividend paying stocks.** The arguments are varied, but usually highlight that these stocks **(1)** pay an attractive dividend yield compared to the current low rates of interest and **(2)** represent a more reliable investment since the dividend stream gives steady returns while the stock price will fluctuate up and down.

For anyone familiar with the classic results of Miller and Modigliani (1961) that dividend policy does not change the value of a firm, these arguments have always seemed less than convincing. The essence of MM's argument is that an investor can produce a stream of cash flows from a non-dividend paying stock simply by selling off a fraction of his holdings and thereby create a dividend paying stock. Conversely an investor in a dividend paying stock can reinvest the dividends into additional shares in the company and thereby be in the same position as if the company did not pay dividends. Given this equivalence, MM go on to show that dividend policy is irrelevant.

When one politely points out the implications of MM, one tends to get one of two reactions from the OP advocating dividend paying stocks. The first is a blank, dull look on OP's face (at least that's what I imagine in my mind's eye). The second is the retort that it might be fine as theory, but real-world frictions such as taxes make the MM irrelevance theorem irrelevant in practice.

A [recent paper by Hartzmark and Solomon](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2876373) attempts to explain why investors differentiate between dividend paying and non-dividend paying stocks. They argue that dividend irrelevance is hard for people to grasp since it **""runs counter to intuitions from other areas of life, whereby harvesting the fruit from a tree is viewed as fundamentally different to harvesting the tree itself.""** I thought that this was a great way of putting it as it gets to the heart of the misunderstanding that many people seem to have.

Their paper is highly readable (i.e. non-technical) and the introduction is especially good at laying out how behavioral biases (in particular, the use of separate ""mental accounts"" for price changes and dividends) leads to irrational behavior. They go on to show, among other things, that investors who focus on dividends pay less attention to capital gains. Overall they find that ""investors do not view dividends and capital gains as equally important contributors of returns, but focus on one variable or the other.""

TL;DR: Focus on total returns and not just the dividend yield. Recent research by Hartzmark and Solomon (link above) does a great job of explaining ""why the popular discourse on dividends diverges so sharply from the academic literature"" and how investors do not properly judge the tradeoff between dividends and price changes. Would love to get people's thoughts about how they look at dividend paying stocks and also what they think of the paper.",252

I currently have 6 holdings of great companies. Right now I feel like this bull market has run up way over these companies and that their growth in their stock price has been due to this market and truly doesn't reflect any earnings growth or growth of the company. 


I have been trying to look for some companies but cannot find anything that I find great and cheap. My own picks are slightly overpriced in my opinion and what I have trouble is:


Should I sell and try to replace these?

R - Ryder recently partnered with Nikola Motors (not Tesla affiliated) who had a small, but impressive product announcement last week. Whether or not it lasts for years, the hype around other energies will increase as we inevitably see oil prices rise.

16-12-04,5ghp9n,Lab-grown meat. Best way to invest as retail investor?,"Hi all, 

I've been following cultured meat (as a personal interest) for a year or so now. Obviously the industry is early stage to the point of being conceptual.

That said, I do think it's an eventual reality - and given the explosion of the ""food identity"" culture in recent times (veganism, gluten free, etc), the market is substantial. Perhaps I'm biased - but as an Albertan-born redneck living out on the west coast for the past decade... I'm still culture-shocked by the prevalence of restaurants and grocery stores who specifically cater to this audience.

Whole Foods, vegan-only restaurants, farm-to-table restaurants... where I live, these places are packed, like clockwork. And this seems to be the case all the way down the WC, from Vancouver to San Diego. No doubt other geographies as well.

Anyway - point being - IF the producers can manufacture something at scale that actually tastes decent, lab meat won't be a discretionary niche product - I believe it could actually disrupt the food industry.

There's a plethora of popular, on-trend reasons why I believe a huge section of the population will buy-in, most notably ethics (animal treatment) and environmental concern (reduced agriculture has massive environmental impact).

Which brings me to my ""epiphany"" moment as an investor:

Normally 1-5% of my portfolio is designated as risk capital. To-date, I've basically just used it to screw around with small caps &amp; metals. I've managed to not lose money so far, but just barely. (So, it's a high-effort, high risk savings account essentially)

Which seems futile.

So, why not invest some of my risk capital into shoot-for-the-moon ideas that I actually want to support?

It could very well end up being a proverbial donation. But if I was planning on donating anyway, might as well expose myself to the small possibility for growth.

Problem is... there doesn't appear to be any conventional way to get in directly.

The largest startup is Memphis Meats, and they're just doing early seed rounds with Angels &amp; VCs. I've spent the last couple days poking around, trying to find other startups... to no avail.

Does anyone know of any publicly traded hedge funds (or similar) that are invested in lab meat?

Thx",213

It has two stage one clinical trials poised to release data in the next 30 days. 

It has approximately .66 cents/share on the books currently, meaning that the shares are vastly undervalued. 

While it's produced a loss every quarter as of yet (pharma start up), it's first two phage cocktails targeting Staphylococcus aureus should be FDA approved by the end of 2017. It will be one of two companies taking a market share treating Staph infections (22b a year market).

Zach's put the target share price @6 usd/share

16-12-04,5gga7w,Negative book value per share?,"I need help calculating the book value per share and I am using a quote from Ben Graham's book, The Intelligent Investor, and numbers from General Mills 2015 annual report.

Here is a quote from The Intelligent Investor, ""Net asset value, book value, balance-sheet value, and tangible-asset value are all synonyms for net worth, or the total value of a company's physical and financial assets minus all its liabilities. It can be calculated using the balance sheets in a company's annual and quarterly reports; from total shareholders' equity, subtract all ""soft"" assets such as goodwill, trademarks, and other intangibles. Divide by the fully diluted number of shares outstanding to arrive at book value per share."".

So, using number from General Mills 2015 annual report we have (in millions) total stockholders' equity of $4,996.7, goodwill of $8,874.9, and other intangible assets of $843.6. Following the above instructions (equity - goodwill - other intangible assets), I get a value of -$4721.8. Dividing this value by the number of shares will give me a negative book value per share. 

Am I doing something wrong? This seems to tell me that the company is worth nothing.

16-12-05,5gj9zf,Question about Marijuana stocks (not your typical post),"Amateur investor here, and no this isn't your typical r/investing Marijuana stock post, but rather a question. It is known that Marijuana is becoming more and more legalized as well as normalized in the United States. As a result, there is potential for a new huge emerging market (right?). 

That being said, I feel like anytime someone in this forum begins to talks of ""marijuana stocks"", they get a cold shoulder and are viewed in a negative light.

Now yes, I know there are some very baseless and uneducated posts/comments along the lines of ""How do I invest in Marijuana?"" that get ridiculed. 

However, is there intelligent conversation to be had over the investing potential of this seemingly rising market, or is there something in the big picture I'm missing? Is the circlejerk conversation over these stocks causing people to not want to talk about the real opportunities? Or is it too much of a broad and unstable market currently to delve upon?

Again I am not trying to infer anything here but rather become more educated on how people are viewing the matter in terms of capitalizing on legalization. ",0

I just bought the L2 on scottrade and will try it for first time on Monday. 

So far on my research I have the following
Scottrade, 7.99 order and 10 bucks a month for L2, no mobile L2
Etrade, 9.99 order and 99 bucks a month for L2 has mobile L2
Ameritrade, 9.99 order and free L2 and mobile L2 on Apple and coming soon on Android.

I'm leaning more towards ameritrade, but I've been following spcl for a while now and I'm iffy on them since they would not allow people to buy when stop sign came up on the stock

There are ways to consolidate debt through online lending and other methods, but first we’ve got to understand the priority system we’re going to use.
The problem for many would-be investors is the knowledge that time is one’s best friend when investing. Most investors can count their remaining decades of life on one hand, so the time to start maximizing investment allocations is now. But then there’s that debt. So should an investor focus solely on debt before investing, put money into both to give the investments that greatest amount of time to grow, or put every spare dollar into investment and just cover the minimum payments on the debt?",33

What was somehow unexpected (even a great trader can't predict the future, right?), was that my bank charges me 32,90€ for European transactions. What I read was 1,99€/transaction, but apparently that's just for their partners.
So basically I paid 14,31€/share...

Thanks to my trader instinct, even with such a bad deal, I'm still up 6,81%. Not bad, is it? The thing is my trader instinct also tells me I'm going to pay those 32,90€ again... Think of it: they fucked me once, why wouldn't they fuck me twice ?

Now I have this dilemma, the only way not to get fucked is to keep those shitty DB stocks.

Thanks for your attention.

* Real-time trades being announced before, during and after they're executed.
* Discussion about day trading, strategies, anything market related.
* Charts and Technical Analysis
* Some irresponsible risk taking.

* We're all here to learn, share and have fun.
* Epic screenshots of wins and fails.


**Reality:**

* Fuck these guys when are they gonna learn how to fucking X when X occurs.
* Me asking a random user what this JNUG is all about since I don't have a clue (other than it being a stock) and getting downvoted almost instantly..

Basically you buy one share, and after the reverse split it becomes 1/6 of a share. Simultaneously, the price of the stock will increase 500%. In most reverse splits, they cash out fractional shares, but in this one they round up fractional shares to full shares. Ta-da, you now own one share priced at $13. Unfortunately your net profit is capped at $13, unless you do this on several different accounts. Use Robinhood to avoid fees taking out a huge chunk.

How much will the buyer have to pay for the note to get a yield of 9% every year for 10 years?

16-12-05,5gmhco,Buy $CRM NOW! Elite investors cashing in on this stock after hitting rock bottom.,"Hey guys,

Here is a recommendation. Buy $CRM. This stock bottomed out a few days ago and is forecast to have a minimum of 80% upside potential. 

$CRM is a company that deals with cloud computing company that deals with customer relationships. After suffering setbacks earlier this year, it seems like they have bottomed out and have a huge upside potential. It has a high P/E so if you're a value investor, then obviously it doesn't fit those principles. But often times, the market doesn't make any sense, and $CRM is one of these stocks. 

My friend is an investment banker and has access to inside information regarding elite investors and what stocks they are buying up. They are currently buying specific Russian stocks (not sure which ones), but he said that buying a Russian ETF like $RSX or $RSXJ is a good idea. 

They are also buying up $GS and $CRM. 

This is all recent (last 6 months) so we are not too late to the game. 

Elite investors buying into $CRM is very recent (today). Last Friday, $CRM (Salesforce) insiders sold $CRM, which is contrary to what elite investors are doing today. ",0

Maybe not exactly YOLO the next day, but if you started buying after the huge correction, in layers, like I did. 

These banks are institutions equivalent to the Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, they have mortgages, deposits, commercial loans etc etc. Brexit was so far from the 2008 mortgage crisis and a lot of you drew parallels.

http://imgur.com/a/A3AfL

The top chart is UK banks bought on the LON exchange. Top 5 biggest UK banks. I'll avoid adding and editing for currency exchange because you would have been even more beneficial, the super strong US dollar.

The bottom chart is 4 of the TOP UK banks traded on the NYSE. Standard Chartered is not traded as and ADR :(.

June 28th is a few days after the dust had settled. Brexit was June 23rd at night, June 24th was panic and sell off, then the weekend. Monday was the first day where things weren't falling off a cliff. The 28th was the first day when things started to look interesting to buy. 

You're all too late to the Pony show now.  I guess you **could** start buying the ADR's but you would have missed out on the correction and the recovery, the price of these ADR's are above pre brexit levels. You missed the boat to the retirement yacht.

Shortsightedness and greed is killing your portfolio.

16-12-05,5go5ra,Brief Post on Risk Management,"A note: this is for equities trades, not Options.

One of the things that so many new traders either don't think about or don't plan for properly is their own personal Risk Management system. The symptoms of this are not obvious at first, but over the long run it can have devastating effects: significantly lower gains or overall loss despite a ""feeling"" of doing well; large unexpected losses; and lack of organization, which can lead to feeling overwhelmed and sap your focus.

A few key things to remember:

**1. Always use a stop loss, never use a market order**

* Never move or delete your stop loss, with the exception of moving it the direction of your trade after you are in profit
* Always use the same style stop loss for every trade: static percent, candlestick support, or other technical stop calculation
* You don't know for sure what a stock will do, so use a Buy Stop Limit order to ensure the stock moves the correct direction before you buy -- never use market orders

**2. Figure out your comfort zone and use the same measurements every time**

* Think about what % of your entire portfolio you could lose in a day without getting depressed
* That % should be your max risk per trade based on stop loss placement
* Bonus, this is very handy for determining how many shares you should buy (always buy a quantity divisible by 100)
* Determine how far your trade will legitimately go based on current trend and previous runs
* Calculate your reward-to-risk ratio (R:R) from stop loss risk and potential profit, and never trade anything that has less than 2:1 reward vs. risk -- aim for &gt;3:1 whenever possible and keep the odds in your favor
* Use appropriately strong support and resistance based on your style of trade (swing, position, intraday, long term)

**3. Find your trader's mindset**

* This is a long journey, with the goal being complete focus on your trading, and removal of any distracting thoughts, including worry, doubt, fear, anxiety, and even euphoria or over-confidence. Everything should feel less personal and more like data - almost ""boring""
* Use a tool to do the math. After your initial evaluation of the trade, you should not have to manually calculate stop losses or entry points -- these things should ideally be pre-calculated based on your own comfort, and reused for each trade
* You should anticipate losses, but never be surprised by the amount lost, because you will be calculating that up front and using the same settings for every trade

I've tried to keep this short, so obviously there's a lot more to Risk Management than is written above. Hopefully these essentials will be helpful. Trade safe!",22

1. Before 3pm ET this Friday you pick ONE specific stock or option position.  This means you can use option spreads/combos or covered calls or whatever but it all has to be on one specific stock

2. You don't have to actually trade (we all have varying means).  Your trade will be based on the closing price of the stock or option on Friday as reported by the mid price on TDA/TOS

3. Your pick has to be something that would tie up no more than $1,000 in margin

4. You must give a one sentence explanation as to why it's your pick - this is so that you can't just pick some absolute flyer that you would never trade in real life

5. You can close the position at any time (take your gains) but you can't trade again once closed. This will be done by replying to your original pick and noting the price you're exiting at with a screenshot

6.  The winner will be whoever has the most cash value at the end of December.  If you pick a stock it will be based on the closing price at December 30 (no AH). If you pick options they must be dated not past December 30 and your proceeds will be based on the closing price of the stock on December 30 (in real life you'd probably trade out before close of business but it's hard to get clear options pricing at close because of after hours and different platforms)

7. I will buy one year of gold for the winner (not valuable but it's a gesture) and I would appreciate if the Mods got on board and gave the user some kind of flair

I'm open to suggested rule changes.  If people seem interested I'll create a thread for people to post their picks by Friday.

I'm thinking about buying a property out in Austin, TX for around 300k (so roughly 60k downpayment at 20%). I then would love to buy more houses around the area, possibly one each year for the next five years or so. I would then be renting these out.  

Currently, I'm renting out in the bay area for 2k/mo.

Because of the nature of my job, I can work anywhere (as long as I am near a major airport) so I am very flexible in terms of location.

Is this a good plan? I figure I would save money and also build equity at the same time by buying a ~300k house in Austin versus paying 2k a month for rent. I'm also trying to build passive income streams and I feel like real estate is a solid way.

I get that there is more risk in that area, but it seems foolish to avoid risk just out of the principal that it's ""risky"". There just seems to be a general sentiment that you can't pick a winning security that can beat the market, which just isn't true.

# Description

Goldman Sachs is a leading global investment banking, securities and investment management firm that provides a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals.The Company operates through four segments: 

* Investment Banking
* Institutional Client Services, i.e. their equities and fixed income trading biz
* Investing &amp; Lending, where they take positions themselves
* Investment Management

So from a financial services perspective, they pretty much do it all, except for offering direct-to-consumer products, though recently they've started to invest in that space.

## Recent financials 

Banks haven't had it easy since the financial crisis. Sob sob. Revenues have been stable, cashflows have been good, but they are still in the process of shrinking their balance sheets and are continually having to boost their equity base. i.e. less assets on the books having to serve a large equity base. Net net, it's hurting the return on equity :(

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $34bn | $35bn | $34bn | $34bn | $29bn|
|EPS | $12.1 | $17.1 | $15.5 | $14.1 | $7.5|
|RoE | 7% | 11%| 11% | 11% | 6%|

And if you look at split in revenue, there is the pure investment banking business which has been averaging at $30bn of sales the last 3 years, and the traditional banking model (interest income &gt; expenses) which has earned $3 to 4bn a year. So you can see that it's the core investment banking business that's key to Goldmans success. 

## Competition

When it comes to the competition they point to a wide range of business models

&gt; Our competitors are other entities that provide investment banking, securities and investment management services, as well as those entities that make investments in securities, commodities, derivatives, real estate, loans and other financial assets. These entities include brokers and dealers, investment banking firms, commercial banks, insurance companies, investment advisers, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds and merchant banks. 

But in the US it's the usual suspects that could be classified as the peers. And weirdly, the Return on Equity for GS is bottom of the class. Though it's pretty bunched and you gotta look to the advisory firms, with small balance sheets, to find any high returns businesses. 

|Companies|Latest Sales|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|
Goldman Sachs Group Inc | $36,369M | 7%
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. | $54,590M  | 10%
Citigroup Inc | $57,540M | 6%
Wells Fargo &amp; Co | $52,248M  | 12%
Bank of America Corp | $50,775M  | 6%
Morgan Stanley | $36,158M  | 7%
Lazard Ltd | $2,283M  | 35%
Evercore Partners Inc. | $1,418M  | 18%

## Cash / Debt?

Well there's really not a lot to say about cash / debt for a bank! That's their whole construct! Instead it's a good idea to work out how much ""assets"" i.e. loans do they have out to clients and what the ""capital"" base is, i.e. equity reserves. As any losses in the loans (""assets"") eat into the capital base (i.e. ""equity""). 

In fact Goldmans has over $500 billion of assets versus it's $70bn of equity. So at a 13% capital ratio, they are one of the better capitalized banks.

Though look at the figures, and marvel. Imagine, they need to have $500bn of ""loans"" out to clients to generate their $34bn of revenues. On this they make $6bn of profit. i.e. $6bn versus the $70bn of equity and $500bn+ of ""assets"".

So shed a tear, go on... it's a tough business to make a return, honest.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $206 target for Goldman Sachs Group Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. Which is odd, since the stock would have to fall 8% to get to their target. 

Wow, imagine the Trump bounce has been especially sweet for investment banks. For most of 2016 GS traded between 10 and 12x earnings, but suddenly it's worth 14x.
 
# Valuation

Though the re-rating's been across the board. Everyone's feeling good about the banks. 

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/gs/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
GS | $88,819M | 14x | 15% | 1% | 2%
JPM | $291,986M | 14x | 5% | 2% | 6%
C | $159,642M | 12x | 3% | 1% | 4%
WFC | $269,095M | 13x | 6% | 3% | 6%
BAC | $214,530M | 15x | 9% | 1% | 4%
MS | $78,340M | 15x | 10% | 2% | 2%
LAZ | $5,381M | 14x | -2% | 6% | 15%
EVR | $2,957M | 16x | 7% | 2% | 7%

Sure it's logical, but won't the long-term economics come through...smaller balance sheets, more equity continuing to depress return?

If banks become ""utilities"", boring rent-seekers, like telecoms businesses and utilities shouldn't they be rated that way? For example here's the largest bank v telco v utility in the US.

""Boring Utilities""|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
JPM | $291,986M | 14x | 5% | 2% | 6%
T | $237,104M | 14x | 9% | 5% | 22%
DUK | $50,582M | 16x | 2% | 5% | 17%

No major shock... except for the crappy dividends the finance utilities pay!

# Dividends

Goldman Sachs Group Inc is forecast to pay a dividend of $2.60 per share, which compares to a forecast EPS of $15.60. On top of that they are allowed to repurchase stock, and they've done a good deal of it, all with the approval of the Federal Reserve.

# Catalysts

In the last 1 month the stock price has moved by 26% that compares with a flat the earnings forecasts. That's against a backdrop of sales off 10% in the first 9 months. 

On to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, the CFO said

&gt; While many of our clients are currently challenged by the low growth environment, we are committed to partnering with them and they look to navigate these headwinds. 

Which hardly inspires confidence. Especially when he follows it up with

&gt; I would like to leave you with one thought. The firm is as focused on navigating today's environment, as well as preparing for the future. You have to do the first really well to be in a position to do the latter. 

With the price above the consensus target, management showing little enthusiasm, and no sign of the economics of the investment banking business improving materially any time soon, I can't feel any love for the vampire squid's stock.

* Five of the world’s seven most heavily traded equity securities are ETFs.
* Because the securities they [ETFs] hold are often not as liquid as the ETF itself, there are risks of mismatches and forced sales.
* [ETFs] do appear to lead markets now, rather than mirror them.

Overal well worth the read. Outlines both criticisms and supports of (passive) ETFs. ",7

16-12-05,5gnh6v,"Why A Hedge Fund Manager Thinks Tesla's Model 3 May Put Elon Musk Out of Business","http://fortune.com/2016/12/02/tesla-model-3-stock-elon-musk

""Mark Spiegel, founder of hedge fund Stanphyl Capital Partners, says the Model 3—which Tesla CEO Elon Musk has promised to sell for as little as $35,000—may put Tesla on a path to bankruptcy before it even comes out.""

Presentation - http://www.tilsonfunds.com/TSLA-Spiegel-RH16.pdf

""Spiegel’s Stanphyl Capital manages $9 million, but has returned 35% ytd"" 

Tesla would lose at least $5,000 for every Model 3 it sells.

In order to sell the Model 3 at as low a price as $35,000 and still make a profit, Tesla would have to cut its production costs by more than half.

The obvious solution? Tesla needs to raise the price of the Model 3—to at least $50,000 for a bare-bones model, or 43% higher than the price currently promised, Spiegel predicts. “I wouldn’t be surprised if Musk claims a $35,000 base price but then never delivers any even CLOSE to that number,”

Additionally, after living in Japan I can attest to how even developed nations are acting as a laggard with payment methods. Japan is still a cash-based society, but there are movements towards credit-card payments as it is finally gaining popularity. 


Visa has 52% of cards in circulation worldwide, and the market in which it operates has large barriers to entry. They have a crazy high operating margin too.

Notable Resistance at $82, but lots of room for a trade within that parameters and current price for a nice gain. However, if you are optimistic and long like myself, this resistance will be broken and this will be a fantastic entry point.


If you are bearish on Visa stock for whatever reason, you could still look at $79.38 as the upcoming resistance and either get some super short-term gains on the stock, or short the stock.

16-12-06,5gpphl,"I've been trading successfully for a little over a year, is it just dumb luck or am I doing it right?","I started trading stocks a little over a year ago.  For the first year, I made a 63.8% return on investment and, for the past month, I have made a 6.47% return.

I have been trading entirely out of retirement accounts, which don't allow margin trading, so every time I do sell a stock I have to wait like 3 days for the funds to fully settle before I can do my next trade.  So, given that limitation, I'm certainly not able to 'day trade' or anything.

My question, and fear, is whether or not this has all just been blind luck and I'm setting myself up for disaster and disappointment. 

My strategy has been fairly simple.  I look for stocks that have a huge amount of liquidity and volume; so that you can always execute a market order to get into or out of a position easily.  

I also look for stocks which go up and down based on the latest press or news stories.  In particular stocks like Tesla and, previously, Solar City, which move by large amounts based on the latest news story in the press.

My strategy is simply that I wait until there is a negative news report and the stock tanks like 5% in a day.  I then buy a bunch of that stock, wait a few days to a week until everyone realizes selling it low was a mistake, and then the price rebounds.  I then sell, and pocket a few percent profit in a matter of days or weeks.

Wash, rinse, repeat, and over time, I have been steadily growing my investment.

For example, just last week I woke up one morning and saw that the entire tech sector tanked, for whatever reason, I don't know why.  I then bought $50,000 worth of the biggest losing major tech stocks.  I waited 4 days, and boom, I made a 3% return.

Have I just been getting dumb lucky?  I can't believe investing is 'this easy' or everyone would be doing it.

I do make extensive use of stop-limit orders to lock in profit and limit the amount of losses I will realize. ",101

Am highlighting the dangers of getting excited about upcoming IPOs like Snapchat. Especially when there are no number!

Love to hear the feedback on the 3 rules of thumb:

* Rule number 1: watch for the hype
* Rule number 2: expect zero shares at the IPO price
* Rule number 3: think long term not short

And love to hear if you agree with my premise that *accelerating sales* is the best way to identify great tech investments.

Thanks a mil,

He estimated that about 90% of Model S shipments had the glass roof option while 60% were sold with the Autopilot 2.0 upgrade – likely propelling ASPs for the company higher in the fourth quarter.

He also said activity on Tesla’s delivery truck – teased by the corporation earlier this year – “seemed more than two times vs. last year’ – further exciting investors of perhaps a surprise launch of a delivery truck by Tesla shortly.

A few of years ago when I was first dipping my toes in, I bought a chunk of stock that ended up dropping to be worth only a couple pennies.  I didn't lose much money so I haven't been concerned too much about it, but I'm not sure what to do with them.  I've just been lazily letting them sit in my account for a couple years now.  Is it better to just sit on them or to sell them and write them off on my taxes?  As much as I've researched the worthless stock deduction, I don't fully understand it.  As far as I understand, the stock isn't considered ""worthless"" as long as it's worth a few pennies, so I can't claim the worthless stock deduction.  Is that correct?  Do I wait for the stock to become completely worthless, before claiming it on my taxes?   Any clarification would be helpful.",25

Well, 4k YOLOers filled out a survey. See: http://imgur.com/gallery/3xwfI

Highlights are:

* 53% are under 25 years old
* 88% male
* 41% are students &amp; 28% are engineers
* 44% have less than a year's experience
* 53% have less than $10k in their account
* 42% trade via Robinhood 
* 50% trade stocks
* 50% want to learn how to trade options
* Trend following is the favorite strategy 26%, followed by rumors 18%

Of course, it was a self selecting survey, and only 4k out of 290k but it's really interesting! Yes?

It seems to me that the market is almost pricing in no rate hike at this point though. This seems odd to me considering that back in September, even the suggestion that there might be a rate hike soon brought the markets down 5%. Now the odds for a hike are even higher, yet we just keep on going up.

16-12-06,5gucxf,"$RLGY is gonna be hurt by rising interest rates, I'd look to short it","Realogy provides real estate franchising and mortgage services.  Their revenues are strongly dependent on housing prices and transaction volumes.

So, what has happened in the month since Trump was elected?

Interest rates on mortgages have skyrocketed 49 BPS to above 4%.  While rates are still historically low, you have to remember that most Americans are leveraged to their eyeballs in mortgage, auto, credit card and student loan debt.  The difference between a 3.5% and a 4.0% 30 year fixed could make a monthly payment unaffordable for most people.

So, we should look for decreases in mortgage originations and a decrease in the Case Shiller.  I'm not an economist by trade (I'm a dumbass bean counter), so maybe someone can help with seasonal adjusted numbers on mortgage origination, housing prices, housing starts and closings.

What happens if we have a dip in housing prices and an increase in mortgage rates?  Absent government meddling (which is a risk), there would be deflationary pressures on housing similar to (but maybe not as bad as) 2008.  People will wait on the sidelines to purchase and have more of a propensity to save the down payment since they will actually get 100-150bps in a money market once the Fed starts raising rates.

But if there is deflation in housing because of rising rates and more cash on the sidelines, $RLGY will get wiped out.  I don't mean it will go out of business, but their whole business model is on rising prices and rising volumes.  They will take a significant hit to revenues and profits and the stock price will follow.

What contrarian information is out there:

- while housing prices are at nominal all-time highs, they are still 18% below inflation adjusted highs - this means there still might be room to run in housing prices to the upside

- government/central-bank intervention in the housing market is likely - we have an activist government that will do everything to prop up asset prices, including housing

- bears have gotten skinned in the last year - equities keep hitting all time highs with housing, likely fueled by excess liquidity - you can't fight the Fed

Therefore, I don't think it's time YET to short $RLGY... I think some things need to play out a bit and there are some risks as discussed above.  But I'm keeping it on my radar.

Discussion, analysis welcome

# Description
Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. is a developer, publisher and marketer of entertainment for consumers around the world. Through its labels, Rockstar Games and 2K, its range of genres includes action, adventure, family/casual, racing, role-playing, shooter, sports and strategy, which it distributes across the world. It owns franchises like Grand Theft Auto, L.A. Noire, Max Payne, Midnight Club and Red Dead. 

## Recent financials 

When I look at the figures I have to say I get scared. Both the top and bottom line are crazy variable.

|March year-end|2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $1.4bn | $1.1bn | $2.4bn | $1.2bn | $0.8bn|
|EPS | -$0.10 | -$3.48 | $3.20 | -$0.34 | -$1.31|

Looking at the recent year, 53% of sales were in the US and 83% were on Consoles. Those trends were pretty stable. Though one trend worth highlighting is that digital sales were 49% of sales (v retailers) last year, compared with just 16% 24 months earlier.

Though the future must be bright, as the expectation is for sales of $1.7bn in the year to March 2017 and a healthy $1.72 a share in earnings. 

## Competition

When it comes to describing the competitive environment

&gt; Competition in the entertainment software industry is based on innovation, features, playability, and product quality; brand name recognition; compatibility with popular platforms; access to distribution channels; price; marketing; and customer service. Our business is driven by hit titles, which require increasing budgets for development and marketing. Competition for our titles is influenced by the timing of competitive product releases and the similarity of such products to our titles and may result in loss of shelf space or a reduction in sell-through of our titles at retail stores.

With Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft, Microsoft, Sony and Electronic Arts all getting mention. Though they do go on to point out that they face competition for time / money from other forms of entertainment: 

&gt; motion pictures, television and audio, social networking, online computer programs, and mobile games 

To boot, I add in Mattel and Hasbro given *toys* are an adjacent category.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. | $1,523M | 14% | N/A
Electronic Arts Inc. | $4,547M | 27% | 37%
Activision Blizzard, Inc. | $5,946M | 32% | 10%
Ubisoft Entertainment SA | €1,394M | 43% | 9%
Hasbro, Inc. | $4,855M | 19% | 33%
Mattel, Inc. | $5,622M | 15% | 14%
Sony Corp (ADR) | $67,713M | 9% | 6%
Microsoft Corporation | $85,394M | 32% | 22%

With all that in mind, TTWO is clearly at the bottom of the class :( 

## Cash / Debt?

TTWO has $663M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 16% of the market value. So nothing to worry about there. 

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $53.49 for TTWO and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 10% to their target.

# Valuation

But with all that in mind why on earth do I want to pay 28x earnings for this stock when everyone else is at 18 to 23x. 

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/ttwo.o/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
TTWO.O | $4,190M | 28x | 12% | 0% | 4%
EA.O | $23,371M | 21x | 15% | 0% | 6%
ATVI.O | $27,112M | 18x | 25% | 1% | 7%
UBIP.PA | €3,527M | 23x | 38% | 0% | 15%
HAS.O | $10,530M | 20x | 11% | 2% | 9%
MAT.O | $10,196M | 23x | 10% | 5% | 11%
SNE | $35,157M | 43x | 24% | 1% | 16%
MSFT.O | $468,232M | 20x | 10% | 3% | 7%

Is there some magic coming on the margin front? Or a major hit about to land in their lap?

# Dividends

TTWO is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. Worse still

&gt; We have never declared or paid cash dividends. We currently anticipate that all future earnings will be retained to finance the growth of our business and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 24% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 29%. Wow. So it's really grown into that valuation. That's against  a backdrop of sales up 18% in the 6 months to Sept.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, they said:

&gt; The potential for our industry has never been stronger and Take-Two is exceedingly well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity strategically, creatively and financially, and to deliver returns for our shareholders over the long-term.

Which is punchy stuff. 

To me the volatility in sales and profits doesn't merit a premium, quite the opposite. And compared with EA or Activision, it's clearly subscale. Sure there maybe some hits coming, but like the movie industry or investing... isn't it sensible to diversify?

16-12-06,5gw27l,Day trading stocks this week so far -- 82% winners,"Market breadth turned up on Friday (11/2) giving a buy signal on the major indexes and since the vast majority of stocks move with the market direction, Friday's buy signal cleared the way for stocks to move higher.

Conveniently for the start of the week, the time to initiate buys was the open of Monday. If we look back there were four stocks in my nifty-fifty stock list that gave individual buys for Monday's open -- SCHN, CECO, TBPH and RIO.

The idea was to buy on the open and sell on the close, a pure day trade on each stock. The value of this kind of trading allows the trader to leverage with margin and retain buying power leverage for each day.

Monday SCHN, from open to close, netted 1.8%, CECO lost 1.2%, TBPH gained 1.7%, and RIO gained .4% for a net of .47%, exclusive of slippage and commission for the basket. While that was not a great gain (leveraged it would have been at least twice as much), it was a profit, and it should be noted that was the first day of the turn to the upside for the market.

And as Monday's market rally got moving, it generated 13 individual stock buy signals in the nifty-fifty stock list. Again it was buy on Tuesday's open (today's open) and sell on today's close.

The results for today's 13 day trades in stocks -- FCX up 1.1%, ACM up 2.8%, NVDA up 1.2%, BBL up 1.5%, TPC up 3.9%, DGI down 1%, NAV up .8%, BHP up 2.2%, IRBT up 1%, FPRX down .01%, ADSK up 7% (the big winner of the week so far), ACAS up .4%, and TWI up .2%.  An un-leveraged net across the basket of 1.6%.

Stocks from my list giving buy signals for tomorrow's open  are HIIQ, MSCC, GPS, IGT, UAL, and BRKS.  

So we'll see how those go.

16-12-06,5guxrz,Buy $GWPH,"GW will have an effective monopoly on CBD/THCV antipsychotic treatments if their proposed formulations (currently in phase II trials in the US) are approved. They have tons of [patents](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20110038958A1/en?q=antipsychotic&amp;assignee=Gw+Pharma+Ltd,Gw+Pharma+Limited) on this stuff, and they're partnering with Otsuka (maker of Abilify) to market CBD/THCV paired with already-approved antipsychotics.

Novel antipsychotics are *money sinks*. Look at the three major antipsychotics released since 1990, and [what their revenue peaked at](http://www.forbes.com/sites/simonking/2013/01/28/the-best-selling-drugs-of-all-time-humira-joins-the-elite/#3ac5a1346193):

* Abilify: $7.4 billion/year
* Seroquel: $6.2 billion/year
* Zyprexa: $5.0 billion/year

CBD shits on Zyprexa as far as efficacy and side effects, and is solidly better than Seroquel and Abilify. I believe these three drugs combined have made a total of around $150 billion, yet GW is only valued at $2.5 billion. I realize the operating margin won't be spectacular compared to these (because the process requires plants to be grown and processed), but an Abilify/CBD combo treatment would be hugely profitable nonetheless.

Does anyone have an issue with my reasoning here? Am I missing something? Because it seems to me that GW is way undervalued.",11

To oversimplify it, oral arguments were this morning between scientists at MIT and Harvard over who owns the patent (or if it will be split) for the gene therapy technique called CRISPR.

The MIT team have started a company called Intellia (NTLA), and the Broad Institute (Harvard) team is commercializing their work under the name Editas (EDIT). 

The court will make a preliminary ruling within a couple weeks. They could rule that the patents do not compete, which would dismiss the case and looks like it would be a huge win for EDIT, or they they could agree that they are in Interference, which would cause a more drawn out court case, but will most likely benefit NTLA.

Both companies now are valued at about 500 million, but once decided the patent alone is going to be worth billions. Not to mention the therapies they're going to develop with it. 

What do we think? Are we betting the decision this month, holding one or the other long term for huge gainz or sitting on the sideline like pussies?",16

* Open interest - the total number of derivatives contracts traded that have not yet been liquidated either by an offsetting derivative transaction or by delivery.

We had a lot of good comments, including many that discussed how paying or not-paying dividends signals something about the company's underlying business or it's management. Obviously analyzing companies can be more complex than looking at one number.

However, it left me wondering about how the returns to stocks have varied by dividend yield in the historical data. Could something that simple mean anything? Here is a quick analysis using data from Ken French for 1927-07 through 2016-10 for stocks sorted into five equal-weighted portfolios based on dividend yield.


Portfolio |1^* | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
:---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
mean|1.16|1.18|1.20|1.24|1.21
std|6.47|5.89|5.77|5.69|6.28
ann Sharpe|0.47|0.53|0.55|0.58|0.51
CAGR|12.07|12.83|13.11|13.79|13.00
^* (1=lowest dividend yield, 5=highest)

The mean and std report statistics for monthly returns. The Sharpe and CAGR are annual numbers. The dividend yield portfolios are *equal-weighted*.

So there doesn't seem to be any clear cut pattern between dividend yields and returns in the long-run data. There certainly isn't an increasing relation between dividend yields and returns. If anything we see that portfolios 3 and 4 in the middle have higher cagr's. The lowest dividend yield stocks do have lower returns, which might be due to a value effect.

well, it's happening December 9th at 9:30AM on the TSX-V (TSX Venture Exchange) trading under the symbol: EMC


if you are in canada you can start buying this stock as soon as it starts trading at 9:30AM on Friday, December 9th. some US and international brokers have access to the TSX-V, so please contact your broker to ask if you are able to buy. otherwise, there will be a listing on the US stock exchange coming soon.


this is the most anticipated marijuana IPO of the year, and the biggest. when tweed (now known as canopy growth corp) started trading on it's IPO day, it went up from $0.89 cents to $2.52 the same day, up 183% in one day. that is absolutely insane, and i do believe that this IPO will be even bigger due to pent up demand and just how hot this sector is right now.


emblem has a world class executive team, and is focusing on medicinal marijuana, recreational marijuana, pharmaceuticals and patient education. they are literally firing on all cylinders. i really do think that this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a major new industry. the anticipation for emblem's IPO is off the charts, and they are literally getting thousands of emails a day from investors all over the world wanting to know more information.


with the canadian governments task force report for marijuana legalization being made public this month (they are just waiting for it to be translated into french), and the canadian government tabling legalization legislation in spring 2017, it looks like recreational use will become legal early 2018. while revenue from medical marijuana industry isn't that huge, the revenue from a recreational industry will be estimated to be over $22 BILLION a year.


""Legalized recreational marijuana promises to spark a $22.6-billion industry in Canada, eclipsing combined sales of beer, wine, and spirits, a new study suggests. The Deloitte report — titled Recreational Marijuana: Insights and Opportunities — being released soon concludes that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s legalization of cannabis next year could jolt the economy."" - source: https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2016/10/27/recreational-weed-could-be-a-226b-industry-study.html


buying into medical marijuana stocks now, when they are most likely going to be the main producers for a recreational framework, would be like buying into alcohol companies before alcohol prohibition ended. i don't think i have to tell you just how insanely huge of an opportunity this is. i literally cannot sleep i am so excited for friday...

16-12-07,5gx7hu,Use of preferred stock ETF over bond ETF for income streams due to tax advantages?,"I get that preferred stock has more risk than a bond and is lower in the capital structure of the company, but I was curious how you guys think about them.

Preferred stock can be used as an income steam in a similar way that bonds are used if you're willing to accept the extra risk. And if you hold an index you don't have to worry about individual selection of preferreds that get converted to common stock. With distributions of bonds being taxed at ordinary income and preferred stock taxed at capital gains rate, it seems like there is an advantage there that outweighs the risk? What am I missing, or how should I be looking at these? On a tax basis it seems preferable to own PFF over a bond fund that's gonna get crushed come tax season.

(I get that the tax issue can be avoided by putting these holdings in a tax-advantaged account, but that's not the road I'm really hoping to go down with the discussion.)

Why?,"I currently own stock in this company (Planet Fitness) and was pleasantly surprised by a big chunk of cash via a dividend deposited into my brokerage account. Having bought at around $15 per share it equated to around a 20% cash yield. 

Having looked around online it appears the CEO was just very bullish and decided to please shareholders and to demonstrate his loyalty to us, or something along those lines, a vote of confidence in the company/shareholders.

However, this insanely fat one off dividend was financed by pure borrowing and taking on a ton of unnecessary debt. Not to mention it's a growth company stock so why not reinvest that money into the company and avoid a tax burden on the shareholder's behalf?

I'm trying to understand the reasoning behind it. Is this normal for growing companies? Their franchising structures allows the company to have relatively low overhead but still..

I'd love to hear what you all think. I'm pleased by the generous dividend but it raises some questions and I'm not overly thrilled about it quite honestly. I'm in this for the long hall.

16-12-07,5gxb1h,Is this considered illegal?,Hypothetically: Say you buy a stock like a company in the eCommerce field and then after accumulating some shares you begin to help the company on the side increasing its sales. Like buying search ads advertising the companies products and other stuff. Your goal is to try and use every avenue to increase the companies sales so when they release earnings the following year they report a higher earnings which hopefully will translate to increase in the stock price. Hypothetically is their anything illegal about this?  What about if you do the opposite and accumulate a large short position and then try to get the company to lose sales and look bad with tons of negative advertisement. Just using every possible tool to put a negative lime light on the company and its products. Hoping that when they release earnings the following year they have a significant dip in sales which may translate to a dip and share price.   I mean with the power of social networks today you could potentially get a viral message out for or against the company but would either situation be potentially illegal. ,17

&gt;The do-whatever-it-takes attitude of New York Fed staff contrasts sharply with the message the central bank is now getting from House Republicans, who have criticized the unconventional strategies the Fed pursued in the wake of the crisis and would like to see more restraint. Such an all-out approach by staff in late-2010 marked something of an evolution from earlier in the year, when worries about runaway inflation in financial markets from the excess liquidity pumped into the system during the crisis caused them to strike a more cautious tone.


Also 

&gt;In a memo in Dudley’s briefing book, Eggertsson called it “inflation budget accounting.” If a central bank misses its 2 percent inflation target for more than four years -- as the Fed in fact has -- it would commit to keeping an easy policy in place for a longer period of time. At the time, the FOMC hadn’t even disclosed its inflation target to the public, however.

&gt;Eggertsson added that the strategy needed to be followed up with actions. Buying more long-term securities was one way. Another: “Other assets, such as purchases of various private securities could serve the same aim,” Eggertsson wrote.

&gt;The Federal Reserve Act doesn’t permit purchases of securities issued by private corporations for monetary policy operations. “But the staff’s job is to explain the logic of the models and the policy makers have to fit that to the conditions and constraints they face with the law and everything else,” McAndrews said.",0

I've been reading at a pretty good clip lately. Maybe a couple books a week, and have been thoroughly enjoying getting through all the classics like ""The Intelligent Investor"" and ""Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits"". 

The one small downside of reading so much, however, is that the number of books you wanted to read also shrinks.

I've sort of grown tired of pop-sci finance books, and want to branch into reading more quantitative, rigorous and academic treatments of investing and finance. I was inspired, in large part, by Buffett's entreaty that those who seek to be good investors should read 500 pages a week. My tentative plan is to print out a few research papers/ shareholder letters/odds and ends a week and then go through and take notes on them and highlight them. 

My question to r/investing, as such, is whether you guys know of any good sources to track down and read academic papers.

Among other things, they provide internet streaming, cloud security, mobile infrastructure, and other Content Delivery Network services.  So if you wanna watch 4k midget porn then companies like this will help make that happen.  Considering that 4k content will be challenging current network infrastructure capacities and hasn't fully taken off yet, web infrastructure companies have much to gain here.

A lot of their top clients are huge Fortune 500 companies and each of their major clients make up no more than 10% of their portfolio.  [Here is their 2015 10k report](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9MzI5MzE2fENoaWxkSUQ9LTF8VHlwZT0z&amp;t=1&amp;cb=635948615596566494) for you assholes to read.

&gt; As of December 31, 2015, our customers included many of the world's leading corporations, including
Airbnb, Apple, Autodesk, BMW, Bristol Myers Squibb, Cathay Pacific, Crate &amp; Barrel, eBay, Electronic Arts,
FedEx, Ford Motor Company, FOX, Home Depot, HubSpot, IKEA, Investec, JetBlue, Marriott, NBCUniversal,
Norwegian Cruise Line, Panasonic, Panera Bread, PayPal, Qantas, Qualcomm, Rabobank, Rakuten, Red Hat,
Salesforce.com, Siemens, Toshiba, Turner Broadcasting, USAA and Virgin America.

The main risk I see is fierce competition in this sector.  There are [67 other CDN providers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) listed globally on the Wikipedia page.  Of these, Verizon, Amazon CloudFront, AT&amp;T, and HP Cloud Services seem to be large competitors.  However, Akamai is a pretty large company and has good brand name status, so its a bit safer to YOLO this sum bitch.  Despite this their year-to-year net income steadily increases by around $300 million, this trend has been holding since 2011.

The company has a 17.7% overhead compared to revenue and $690 million in debt.  Considering that their total revenue is around $2.2 billion there is some risk there, but the timeframe for paying this debt is 2019 and by then most of you fags will be long gone from this stock riding your gold encrusted free-range yachts from MSTX winnings.

From a technical perspective this stock looks good in the short term.  [$AKAM is at the local minimum of a rising trend with 90% probability of a 33% increase in share price over the next 3 months](http://www.stockinvest.us/technical-analysis/AKAM) (from $65 now to $85.89 - $103.88).  Who doesn't want 33% more money?  The 3 month timeframe is an eternity for WSB though since most of y'all would rather JNUG on a daily basis, but to each their own.  Recommended timeframe would be several months since the price tends to jump a bit in the 3-4 month timeframe.

16-12-07,5h24ec,Rolls-Royce/ $RYCEY,"Rolls-royce is at a 6 year low. From my understanding, this is due to massive profit loss due to updated finance management/reporting rules. I can't really find any other information for why the stock is trading so low except for blurbs from advisors rating it a sell (now rating it a hold). Most of their holdings (40% of RR holdings) come from aerospace which is mostly maintenance of their gas turbine engines. They take an initial profit loss of 1-2 million per engine but make long term profits from their maintenance (like solar city). Supposedly they've had a recent slump in engine orders. 16% of their holdings come from the Marine sector- I forsee a majority of this coming from their development of automated ship technology in the near future (aka drone ships) which they plan on implementing within the next few years. I think it's possible that their drone ship technology will make their marine sector outperform their aerospace sector in a few years. They are the only public company that I know of that is developing drone ship technology.

Recently we have been debating an institutional ETF or mutual fund as a holding ground for those funds, anticipating that our drive to get more balanced will take a year or maybe more, as we make decisions and buy monthly.  

So: is there a role for mutual funds or etfs as a storage vehicle for cash?

16-12-07,5h2p9q,Fidelity Freedom Fund - Proxy Vote Request for Board of Trustees?,"Our 401k is invested in a Fidelity target fund, the Fidelity Freedom K 2050 fund.

We have received in the mail a request to vote:

1. To vote for (or to withhold all, or to vote all except names we specify) a board of trustees
2. To approve an amended and restated management contract between the fund and FMR Co., Inc. (Options are for/against/abstain)

We have actually received a couple of these, figured ""we're just the little guy"" and didn't bother returning them. The last one came with a note from one of the trustees (Abigail P. Johnson) saying that our vote matters to help pass a proposal to approve new management contracts that will REDUCE EXPENSES of each Freedom Fund.

Do you research the board of trustees members for the funds where you are invested in order to provide educated votes for these proxies? If so, where do you find useful information? What kinds of things are you looking for?

Is there a way to verify that the amended and restated management contract actually reduces our fund expenses?

16-12-08,5h6kb2,Can we talk about Fitbit acquiring pebble?,"Link from Fitbit explaining the acquisition 

https://investor.fitbit.com/press/press-releases/press-release-details/2016/Fitbit-Inc-Acquires-Assets-from-Pebble/default.aspx

From what I understand they plan to discontinue the pebble watches and are going to integrate key IP and personnel into their own line of watches.

anecdotally, i'm interested because for a while I wore a fitbit surge.  I'd wear it for a couple months and then get sick of charging it every day and stop wearing.  Recently the band broke and it cannot be repaired.  So I replaced it with a pebble.  The pebble does everything my fitbit did except monitor my heart rate.  It also doesn't have a touch screen, but that doesn't bother me at all.  A 1x1 inch touch screen is just about worthless anyway.  On the plus side, the battery life is about a week!  And really important to me, the pebble is a aesthetically, a very nice watch.  The replaceable bands is a cool concept, and I think I'll pick up one or two next week.

Stock a day recently covered Fitbit's situation quite well:  https://www.reddit.com/r/stockaday/comments/4xa6be/is_fitbit_now_forgot_fit/ 

the value of the stock has tanked despite growth in earnings.  2016 hasn't had the same kind of amazing growth and 2015, but its still growing.  If they can incorporate some of what makes the pebble great into a new line of products, I think they are positioned to hold a good position in the smart watch category... but they are fighting with the Goliaths of the tech industry.

With a PE of about 20, its still not really a discount, but why should they be. ",4

I've decided that I would like to invest several thousand dollars into various commodity related stocks.  However, it has been over 7 years since the current bull market began and I sense that a massive correction is going to occur - just using common sense and looking at the historical charts.

That beings said, I am wondering whether or not a, say, 3000 or 4000 drop in the DJI and similar percentage drops in the S&amp;P and Nasdaq will spill over into the commodity market as well.  If so, would it not make the most sense to wait until the correction to purchase these stocks rather than right now?

The stocks I'm looking at right now are Steel and all of the minerals associated with it production, copper, uranium, oil, etc.  All of these markets are to a certain extent quite depressed right now and SEEM like good buying opportunities.  BUT if there's a large correction in the horizon, does it not make sense to wait until that happens to strike?

16-12-08,5h5fc5,Thoughts on AKRX?,"[Yahoo Finance link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AKRX?p=AKRX)

Generic Pharma manufacturer.  John Kapoor (self-made billionaire) is a major shareholder and founder.  Total revenues should come in around 1.1b this year, up from 317m in 2013, 555m in 2014, and 985m last year.  Liabilities have risen sharply in that time as well, from 172m year end 2013 to 1.151b as of last quarter.  But operating income should come in around 355m (+/-10m) this year, up from 88m in 2013.  Cash flow is down this year, but they prepaid $200m in outstanding debt facilities in February of 2016.  They're growing via smart acquisitions, which is the way to go, imho.

They're expanding investments into R&amp;D, and just opened a new facility.  They're also repurchasing shares, with $25m spent and over $175m remaining in repurchase authorization.  I don't think they will deploy much more of that for stock buybacks unless the price continues to remain depressed, they likely have better options in terms of ROI elsewhere.

The major issue behind the recent fall in share price is a [DOJ investigation and civil suits into alleged price fixing of clobetasol propionate](http://www.investopedia.com/news/unions-drug-makers-colluded-prices-nvs-teva/), a drug used to treat psoriasis/dermatitis/etc.  The cases mostly focus on the fact that they all had the same list price on these drugs, but one lifted the price substantially, and the rest followed. AKRX actually wasn't involved in this directly, it was a company they acquired, Hi-Tech Pharmacal.  Hi-Tech didn't raise its price until 3 months after the initial raise, however, so I feel the DOJ investigation may find no wrongdoing, but that's speculation on my part.

There's been some accounting discrepancies in the past, but after talking to them today and reading over the restated reports, it doesn't seem as if it was a major issue, and further, it seems like better controls are in place to prevent these issues going forward.

Additionally, they've got a backlog of about 80 ANDA's awaiting approval at the FDA, and the FDA appears to be slowing on the rate of approvals.  This impacts forward revenue growth, as new product pipelines are the most cost-effective way for companies of this size to drive growth.

All this and a PE of between 12 and 13.  At these prices, it seems like it might be a takeover target, as well.  However given the upward momentum the company seems to be enjoying, I'm not sure John Kapoor will sell out as opposed to holding, and that's a large swathe of shares that won't move if so.  There's risk, for sure, but with risk comes reward, and I feel the risks that have caused this to drop from $34 since July-August to present are overblown.  Seems like a well-managed company with good growth and great potential upside to me, but I'd love to hear other thoughts.

16-12-08,5h7h02,Microsoft to pay $56 per user on LinkedIn. Is that worth it?,"Microsoft now has approval from all the major States to acquire LinkedIn for $26 Billion (which is it's Market Capital, so makes sense).  
http://smartstocknews.com/29602-microsoft-corporation-msft-gains-eu-antitrust-approval-to-acquire-linkedin-corp-lnkd  
Does that seem fair?  
InkdIn has one of the highest P/E ratios I've ever seen (some my disagree, but I think that P/E is an appropriate way to evaluate risk).  
So I'm curious what MSFT hopes to gain by acquiring LNKD.  
If it's just the userbase then MSFT is paying $56 per user, is that really worth it?  
$26,000,000,000 / 460,000,000 users = ~56 dollars / user.  
I've also seen some sites say MSFT wants LNKD's ""recruitment services"", again I don't see how this helps them.  
I like LinkedIn, but I wouldn't pay $26,000,000,000 for it, why would Microsoft?  

**edit:**  
If Microsoft just wanted to diversify... WHY DIDN'T THEY COMPETE WITH VERIZON FOR YAHOO?  
Verizon got Yahoo for just under $5B.
http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/25/technology/yahoo-verizon-deal-sale
Yahoo does all kinds of stuff. AND they have Tumblr, which in my opinion, is a more successful Social-media app then LinkedIn by far.  
.  
**Edit 2:**  
So I asked the CFO of the company I work for (business major) and he said this...  
&gt;They're an enterprise software provider, and they're buying a social media site that decision makers for their target customers use constantly for business purposes. They'll probably integrate with their own platforms (one drive, new slack clone) to create a whole ecosystem for themselves focused on enterprise social media. They overpaid though.  
They're probably going to turn it into a salesforce competitor, the problem with the price they paid is that no one else would have offered that much

So it sounds like Microsoft has some sort of long term goal, like they're trying to create their own ""full ecosystem"", and this was a very expensive step toward that goal.  
The acquisition still doesn't make sense to me though (like when Facebook bought Oculus to for 2B).   
I truly feel like there's something else at play here, beyond Taxes.  
.  
*Edit 3:**  
&gt;Your CEO is not very well informed, sorry to say. First, the price they paid may be too much, but that is not something that can be said without doing a proper analysis of the company's fundamentals. The company was trading at that price just a few months earlier so saying that they overpaid and therefore the whole market is wrong about Linkedin's price before doing your due dil is a bit presumtuous. Second, Microsoft already has a salesforce competitor, called Dynamics CRM. If framed around the CRM business, the linkedin acquisition makes a lot of sense as it help differentiate Microsoft's offering while at the same time keeps Salesforce from having it. Microsoft has the ecosystem advantage (office 365, azure, dynamics) but this can only go so far if salesforce gets too far ahead with their offering (they are already the clear leaders). Third, I personally think that Satya Nadella is the ultimate CEO and the best one for Microsoft, so I am ready to give him the beneift of the doubt on this one, your boss should probably do the same.

# Description

Corning Incorporated is engaged in the manufacture of specialty glass and ceramics. It trademarks, including Corning, Celcor, ClearCurve, DuraTrap, Eagle XG, Epic, Gorilla, HPFS, Pyrex, Steuben, Falcon, SMF-28e and Willow.

The Company operates in five segments: 

* Display Technologies (34% of sales), which manufactures glass substrates; 
* Optical Communications (32%), which is engaged in providing optical solutions; 
* Environmental Technologies (12%), which manufactures ceramic substrates and filter products; 
* Specialty Materials (13%), which manufactures products that provide over 150 material formulations for glass, glass ceramics and fluoride crystals, and 
* Life Sciences segment (9%), which is a developer, manufacturer and supplier of scientific laboratory products. 

## Recent financials 

The numbers looks reasonable... and they appear to have a nice position in the market. Though since a lot of sales go Japan and Korea the currencies can mess up the top line. 

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $9.1bn | $9.7bn | $7.8bn | $8.0bn | $7.9bn|
|EPS | $1.00 | $1.73 | $1.34 | $1.09 | $1.78|

To the extent that in their annual report they wrote:

&gt; Our financial strength also allows us to increase our return to shareholders. Through 2019, we expect to generate and deploy over $20 billion in cash and to return more than $10 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As a result, we expect to increase our dividend per common share by at least 10% annually through 2019.

Music to the earns of any shareholder.

## Competition

Let's focus on the two largest divisions

&gt; Display Technologies Segment: We believe Corning is the largest worldwide producer of glass substrates for LCD displays. Asahi Glass Co. Ltd. and Nippon Electric Glass Co. Ltd. are Corning’s principal competitors in display glass substrates.
&gt; Optical Communications Segment: Corning is a leading competitor in the segment’s principal product groups, which include carrier and enterprise networks.  The primary competing producers are Commscope and Prysmian Group.

*Annoyingly* the major competitors aren't in the US, so it's hard to have a good peer list. Though using similar sector codes, we can see that Corning's at the top of the class. 

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Corning Incorporated | $9,145M | 25% | 14%
LG Display Co Ltd. (ADR) | $22,522M | 14% | 1%
AU Optronics Corp (ADR) | $10,115M | 15% | -5%
Daktronics, Inc. | $589M | 5% | 5%
Microvision, Inc. | $14M | -ve | -ve
Prysmian SpA | €7,361M | 8% | 18%
Commscope Holding Company Inc | $4,887M | 21% | 7%


## Cash / Debt?

Corning Incorporated has $1,402M of net debt. That is 0.6x it's latest operating profit. Which is pretty reasonable.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $23.28 for Corning Incorporated and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. Which is a little odd, since the share price is above the price target. 

# Valuation

At 16x forecast earnings it really doesn't feel expensive. Though it's not far off the valuation of COMM which seems to have a pretty similar profile. Is it a matter that this industry doesn't deserve a higher valuation? It's traded between 12 and 17x over the last year.

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/glw/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|

COMM.O | $7,077M | 14x | 14% | 0% | 7%

# Dividends

Corning Incorporated is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.51 per share, which compares to a forecast EPS of $1.49. And as highlighted above, they are keen to return a lotta cash to shareholders over the next 3 years.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 8% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 5%. That's against a backdrop of sales up 1% in the first 9 months of 2015. 

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, they said

&gt;  we are very pleased with the strong sequential and year-over-year growth in sales and earnings in the third quarter, and we expect similarly strong year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. Other than Optical Communications, all of our businesses met or exceeded expectations. 

The near term aside, there's clear confidence going into the future by the management. 

If I had to grumble it would be that management likes talking about *Core EPS* which is a non-GAAP figure which ""surprisingly"" is higher than the reported figure. e.g. $0.42 Core v $0.26 Reported in the 3rd quarter. Personally I hate when management feels obliged to mess 'round with the figures. Can't they just speak for themselves?

Given Corning's been around for over 150 years and has a good lead on the competitors, it feels like there is a nice little moat... but is today a good time to play? The stock seems to disappoint investors every year or two and take a real beating... so maybe I should nibble now in the hope of a better entry price later?

I'm way too busy right now to dabble with stocks, so he offered to monitor it for me.  He's retired,  owns good amount of real estate, and just has time in his hands.

What do you think about SDIV? Also, what are the risks associated with ETFs? I know a lot of people put large chunks of their funds in a single ETF, but it looks risky from the outside. I know they are diversified across sectors but I assume they are managed/controlled by some particular entity.

16-12-08,5h8jp8,Bonus puts me over Roth IRA limit. Now what?,"Hello all, thanks for your continued support. It's changed my life for the better. Today I'm wondering what to use in place of a Roth IRA (or perhaps use it in a backdoor or conversion type of way?)

I found out today that I will be getting a bonus that will move me into the ""phase out"" limit of the Roth IRA.

I've previously asked many questions about the Roth IRA and was very excited to be using it. However, since I am already in the phase out stage, I would like a more long term consistent strategy than putting in a reduced amount this year, and perhaps being unable to contribute two years from now.

Current goals were to max out 401(k) and Roth IRA meaning an annual retirement contribution of 18,000 + 5,500 = $23,500. 

What should I do now? I believe I might have to hire an accountant if I want to do the backdoor / conversion and frankly that does not appeal to me because I like to do everything myself. Thanks for any feedback or suggestions!",8

They say they are using the extra funds to grow their sales force, but then why not sell shares to save the market freakout? That remains to be answered. However, on the surface, as long as the company is alright, I love it when they reduce the payout and dividend yield junkies go fleeing, not being the types to assess what might be going on with the underlying business.

16-12-09,5har6c,"Day Trading Stocks -- again winners, winner...","The day-trading stocks for today again scored with the market’s continued rally but a stall may be coming Friday.

Today’s basket of stocks from my nifty-fifty list — BBL, NAV, SKYW, BGFV, YRD, MU and FNSR (the leader up 5.86% for the day) — had five winners and one loser for a net gain of 1.8% for the day.  That won/loss on stock day trades for the week stays just above 82%.

However, there is a clue to tomorrow’s possible action since there is only one stock – DGI – on the list giving a buy for tomorrow’s open.  Forty-one of the fifty stocks on my list are on buys for the current market upswing (down from 42 yesterday).  Often when one runs out of new stocks to buy the swing is ready to stall, and maybe fall.  That comes with market indexes up 5 days in a row so a pause here will not be surprising.

Been a very good week for the bulls.

**UPDATE: 12/9/16**

**DGI, the one stock giving a buy signal for a day trade today finished down .62%, a small loss and a small price to pay for very fine week.  Although the stock indexes were up again - 6 days in a row - there were more signs of a pullback, or at least a pause, in the rally - only 14 of the 50 stocks on my nifty-fifty stock list were up on the day.**",1

16-12-08,5h96d6,Trying to learn why certain pharm stocks behaved how they did today. ($ETRM $IDXG $RNVA etc),"So a lot seems to be going on with smaller pharma stocks, with notable gainers like $IDXG (+320% at the time of this post). 

$IDXG made a great announcement about their win with Aetna which helps explain their movement.

As well the new drug legislation passing could have boosted pharma today right?

For example $ETRM is currently +43% even though the only thing affecting them I think is their shareholder meeting on Monday. And it seems that meeting is about trying to comply with the Exchange's rules about cap and min share price. I thought reverse splits usually hurt people's outlook on the stock? 

$ETRM did have a conference call on Nov 30 that seemed to have good news even if it was just a win with getting their devices into VA hospitals. Still no insurance deals yet though. My question is why didn't this affect the stock price that week? $ETRM didn't really move until today and the only thing I can think is that the new legislation is the cause of it?

$SSH doesn't have any news except an extension to try and get their shares above the exchange min ($1) which probably means reverse splits. But they're up 200% right now!

$NVCN had their spike two days ago after news of their big deal with Boston Scientific. I'm assuming they're down today (-5%) because the hype is dying down from Tuesday's movement. 

And then Pfizer is still dropping. So maybe the new drug legislation isn't totally the cause here?

What do you think is driving these stocks? I've been watching these for a few days and it's interesting how things have moved. Just would like to know what you all think.  ",8

Someone help me understand where I went wrong with my technical analysis,"I've been investing for a little over 3 years now and typically stick to index funds for the majority of my portfolio. I've learned my lesson from picking individual stocks without doing my due diligence beforehand and only choose individual stock positions after lengthy research. This has generally worked for me on everything but $GILD.

The biotech industry in general was hit hard by Skrelli and Clinton but with her loss and his irrelevance, it's come up a bit. Pharma companies trade around 20 P/E multiples but $GILD is sitting around 8 (might be closer to 7). I understand they'll be losing revenue from Sovaldi since it cures instead of treats but I still think they have a strong pipeline and are dominant in the HIV space. They're sitting on piles of cash and have done a strong buyback this year. 

I bought thinking that their P/E would eventually match the general pharma industry's but their lagging badly and I don't understand why. The only thing I see consistently being cited with them is that they haven't made any big acquisitions. I wonder though if that's big enough of a deal to drop them 25% YTD. 

Basically I'm trying to figure out if there was something in their technicals I should have seen which would have alerted me to the beating they've taken this year. They looked solid but judging by their performance this year, I was wrong. I'd really like some input on this.",34

# Description

The Southern Company owns Southern Power. Its traditional operating companies, include Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power and Mississippi Power. They are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in over four Southeastern states. 

$SO also has interests in the Southern Communications Services, Inc., Southern Nuclear Operating Company, Inc., Southern Company Holdings, Inc. and PowerSecure International, Inc.

And if you are wondering about the split of business, let's look at KiloWattHours sold: Residential 52bn; Commercial 54bn; Industrial 54bn; and Wholesale 31bn. And for the sources of their electricity, Gas was 46% in 2015, Coal 34%, Nuclear 16% and Renewables 4%.

## Recent financials 

Sales have been pretty stable, earnings and returns have been up and down, and dividends growing.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $17.5bn | $18.5bn | $17.1bn | $16.5bn | $17.7bn|
|EPS | $2.59 | $2.18 | $1.87 | $2.67 | $2.55|
|DPS | $2.15 | $2.08 | $2.01 | $1.94 | $1.87|
|RoE | 12% | 10% | 9% | 13% | 13%|

Though it's pretty impressive how close earnings and dividends are... is as if they are trying to return it all to shareholders. Suppose, it's a low-growth utility after all!

## Competition

It's a difficult market to think of competitively as there is a lot of regulation and there are big power plants to build, so often one thinks monopoly rather than competition! 

But let's extract the key points from their annual

&gt; * The electric utility industry in the U.S. is continuing to evolve as a result of regulatory and competitive factors. 
&gt; * Generally, the traditional operating companies have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, competition in their respective retail service territories in varying degrees from the development and deployment of alternative energy sources such as self-generation (as described below) and distributed generation technologies, as well as other factors.
&gt; * Southern Power competes with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, and others for wholesale energy sales primarily in the Southeastern U.S. wholesale market. 

Looking at the stats let's make a comparison with other Electric utilities. Even if they are more peers than competitors!

Now it's not the highest in the biz, that's $D, but it's pretty impressive :)

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Southern Co | $18,283M | 42% | 11%
American Electric Power Company Inc | $16,204M | 33% | 3%
Dominion Resources, Inc. | $11,207M | 47% | 15%
Duke Energy Corp | $23,249M | 41% | 7%
Consolidated Edison, Inc. | $12,074M | 30% | 9%
Edison International | $11,325M | 35% | 8%
Exelon Corporation | $30,186M | 28% | 5%
Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. | $9,249M | 35% | 10%

## Cash / Debt?

Southern Co has $43,706M of net debt. That is 5.6x it's latest operating profit. Of course, for a cyclical business / retailer we'd be worried, but it's okay for a utility! People want to keep the lights on, literally. Regulators too.


# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $51.25 for Southern Co and their recommendation to clients is _Hold_. That implies an upside of 8% to their target.

# Valuation

Unsurprisingly $D is at the top of the pack given its superior margins and forecast growth. But at 5% yield and a 16x earnings it's hard not to like $SO, is it. 

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/so/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
SO | $46,462M | 16x | 4% | 5% | 16%
AEP | $29,591M | 16x | 2% | 4% | 12%
D | $46,066M | 19x | 6% | 4% | 12%
DUK | $51,485M | 16x | 2% | 5% | 17%
ED | $21,508M | 18x | 2% | 4% | 15%
EIX | $22,624M | 18x | 2% | 3% | 16%
EXC | $31,576M | 13x | 2% | 4% | 12%
PEG | $21,375M | 15x | 1% | 4% | 14%

Though in a Trumpian world, where it's all about inflation and growth, bond-proxies like Utilities, REITs and Telcos are likely to be less loved. :(

Over the last 12 months the stocks traded between 15 and 19x forecast earnings. So at least it's not at a peak! 


# Dividends

Southern Co is forecast to pay a dividend of $2.22 per share, compared with a forecast EPS of $2.90. Given the high payout ratio, it's hardly surprising that they aren't engaged in any major stock repurchasing!

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -7% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 1%. That's against a backdrop of sales up 6% in the first 9 months.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, they talked about steady earnings, dividends and their plans for the future. In particular how well positioned they are for a low carbon future, with a lot of investment in nuclear. All very sensible!

And how about the stock? Well it seems like a solid play. I can't say I'd be excited owning Southern, but with a strong divie, an okay valuation, I could see myself taking it up to diversify my portfolio. Though if diversification isn't your thing, they you better look elsewhere!

I know getting experience with investing and all will be faster but I want to build a solid foundation before I begin. So I wanted to find out what topics or subtopics will help? Finance books? Econs books?

16-12-09,5herkt,New Investor: Need some criticism/advice from my recent choices.,"I am relatively new to this subreddit, so please let me know if I am doing anything wrong here.

Here is my situation:

I am a 20 year old college student and started investing in the stock market because it has always interested me.

After some advice from my father, I threw 1,000$ into a TD Ameritrade account (I am planning on going for the long term, but I still want to really grow my portfolio).

TD Ameritrade has a 10$ fee everytime you make a trade (a lot of my decisions are based around this at the moment). 

So far I have made three orders (30$ in fees):

-17 Shares of $CXW (396.97 at time of purchase; now worth 420.24)

-12 Shares of $CLF (122.88 at time of purchase; now worth 117.48)

-4 Shares of $AAPL (440.62 at time of purchase; now worth 456.86)

After the trades, my account's value was 970$ because of the fees. It is now valued at 1,004.04$ (at time of writing; its changing really quickly which is always a joy to watch).

So far, I am extremely happy with $CXW and $AAPL. I am going to ride $CXW up for a while and sell when it comes to a reasonable profit (recommendations would be great). I am going to keep my 4 shares of $AAPL for the long term and ride the dividends. 

The stock I am worried about is $CLF since I have lost a total of 5$ on it so far (I'm probably over reacting, but I want to play this as smart as possible). I bought it initially for a few reasons: the upward momentum, Market Edge saying to purchase it, the future reduction of EPA regulations, and a growing infrastructure that needs steel which is produced from iron. Last earnings report has reported negative earnings, but it is predicted the company will become profitable next quarter. It also has an extremely high volatility compared to the rest of the industry. What should I do with this stock...? Is it smart to hold onto and just ride it a bit?

Overall:

How am I doing so far?

What industries or stocks should I start looking into purchasing (I'm planning to throw in 250$ every few months)?
Should I be worried about any of my purchases?

For the long term, is TD Ameritrade a good choice to stay a part of (due to my situation)?

Any red flags you see?

Am I doing everything correctly so far?

Please be brutally honest. I am willing to face all truths. I would rather lose small amounts of money now on mistakes than thousands of dollars later on larger mistakes.

Again, sorry if I did anything in my post incorrectly (feel free to point out things, I attempted to comply by all rules).",18
16-12-09,5hes6v,[Help] Buying/Selling Penny Stocks,"I have been buying stocks for dividends purpose for several months from Scottrade and I'm happy so far, with Scottrade and the stocks.

Now, I like to take a risk to do penny stocks. But I have couple question on my mind. If you guys can help me answer some I will really appreciate. 

1) In penny stock, can buy a stock and sell it in same day?
2) Is there any hidden fee, beside paying commission when buying and selling?
3) Is there limit of buying multiple stock in a day? And selling

If I can do all of the questions above can please suggest me any brokers? I already heard of E-Trade and Charles Schwab.

16-12-10,5hj5g9,Sitting on just over 100k. Trying to devise an investment strategy.,"About 2 years ago I took a contracting job overseas. Wife and I just moved back this summer. I'm early 30's and she's late 20's.  
&amp;nbsp;  
    My risk tolerance is moderate. Risky but not too risky. I wanna make money, not loose it.  
&amp;nbsp;  
What are you current holdings? I opened up a optionshouse account and I've been looking over some stocks. I jumped on the AMD bandwagon when it dipped below 10 bucks today. I wanted to get on sooner but it took 6 business days to open my brokerage account and add funding. I wanted in at $8ish. I'm also looking at picking up a sizeable amount of long term growth stocks with high dividend payouts ie coke, ge, maybe jnj even though it's on the high side.

&amp;nbsp;  

Any other assets? We currently rent, have no sizeable debt, newer cars are paid for, and we have a combined income now of around 90k in a moderately sized midwestern city.  
&amp;nbsp;  

What is your time horizon? I'd like to invest long term, maybe get to a point where my portfolio residuals are so great that it would create a passive income for us and we could move to Costa Rica. I guess that's the dream.  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
  Any big debts? None, not even kids.

I might call my bank and see if I can talk to an advisor tomorrow. I'm interested to hear some ideas though.

&amp;nbsp;  

edit: Man, I guess I wasn't expecting this many people to chime in. I appreciate everybody taking the time to post some advice. As a newbie investor, this thread has definitely made me more aware of available options that I hadn't even considered.",54

16-12-10,5hjgyz,What do you guys think about Nintendo?,"May just me being a big kid, but is NTDOY a stronger buy right now than many think? Here are my reasons:

1. Still a relatively cheap stock price, currently hovering ~$30 per share
2. Nintendo has been a very groundbreaking company with multiple known mascot characters, similarly to the way Mickey, Minnie, and Pluto is to Disney, Mario, Zelda, and Donkey Kong are to Nintendo
3. A very heavy focus on mobile and In App Purchase (IAP) micro transactions as seen with Pokemon GO almost consistently being in the top 25 gross paid apps on iOS, and Super Mario Run coming out next week.
4. Recent partnerships with Universal Studios theme parks to open a designated Nintendo section
5. The new Nintendo Switch launches end of Q1, sometime in March
6. The rise of eSports and how Nintendo is trying to push Super Smash Bros / Splatoon franchises (Roughly 150,000 people were watching Evolution Fighting Game World Championships in Las Vegas earlier this year for Super Smash Bros franchise)

I'll be posting my potential penny plays here. I'm not giving anyone special privileges by PM-ing them my plays specifically so **everything I got is going to be posted in this subreddit** whenever I think I find something that is potentially exciting.

Some updates: Float is pretty low on SYRX ~18m and IDXG was around 10m~. IDXG started out with a 100% day with huge volume and no news with the following day receiving big premarket news. My gut feeling says their is a **possibility** of the same scenario in the works again for SYRX. They are on the tip of the iceberg for meeting continued listing requirements on NASDAQ and it would be smart to release whatever news they have on extremely high volume to cause a **massive** movement upwards and save their stock from delisting. ***Just my two cents though, not real DD, just speculation***.

16-12-09,5hffco,Fukushima Estimated Clean Up Costs Double $TKECF,"&gt; Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said on Friday it has nearly doubled its projections for costs related to the Fukushima nuclear disaster, including decommissioning and compensation, to 21.5 trillion yen ($188.40 billion). In 2013, the ministry had calculated the cost at 11 trillion yen. **The new government projection calls for 7.9 trillion yen to be paid in reparations, compared with the earlier estimate of 5.4 trillion.**

http://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/08/reuters-america-update-1-japan-nearly-doubles-fukushima-disaster-related-cost-to-188-bln.html

So TEPCO might have to pay out some additional compensation. Not the worst thing in the world, especially with that interest free loan. Absent from the article (but mentioned on CNBC TV) was that TEPCO was ""expected"" to pay for most of the decommissioning and clean up. I, of course, LOLed.

* How old are you?
* Are you employed/making income? How much?
* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)
* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)
* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
* Any big debts?
* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.

16-12-10,5hhif6,Free Scanner for sudden increases in volume?,"Hi everyone

As said in the title, I am looking for some scanners for day trading. I've been using my brokers scanners, but it doesn't register sudden changes in volume, just overall volume, gaps, % price increase, etc..

For example, if something is quiet in the morning only to spike up a few hours in, it won't show up on my scans because it has a relatively low volume compared to a stock that has had a moderate volume for most of the day. This has made me miss a few different opportunities. 

For example, I missed out on $FOXA today with their large jump because my scanners didn't pick up the volume until the huge spike occurred, as it had to reach a high enough overall volume, not just a spike.

So overall, is there any scanner where I can get a notice where we see unusually high volume relative to say a 20-day average of volume or something?

16-12-09,5hfm4w,Should I invest in gold?,"Hi, 

So I am at the inception of my personal investment process and I unfortunately or fortunately  came across Peter Schiff for the first time.

Due to my lack of knowledge on U.S Debt matters I don't know how dire our debt crisis is and how unstable our dollar will be in the near future.

Listening to Schiff's doomsday scenario is scary, but considering his company sells precious metals it's no great surprise that he's pushing everyone to buy gold.

I have $50,000 dollars to invest and a moderate amount of risk tolerance. While I don't want to act imprudently I have no issue with buying gold as part of a well diversified portfolio.

1. Is there anything behind Schiffs claims and should I be concerned about my cash assets?

2. Is there any reason not to allocate 10-15K in gold at the moment while prices are at their lowest in six months?

Thank you in advance.",0

I am one of the ones who bought in to the hype around SHOM, doing little research. However, after seeing some of the negative posts surrounding the Coca Cola deal (whatever you want to call it) I decided to do my own investigation and prediction. For period ending Sep 30th 2016 they had a net income of 32,255. This is much better than some statements I looked at in 2014. At least it appears as a step in the right direction. Now in terms of the ""Coca Cola Deal""- they may not have inked a partnership with Coca Cola but at least they DID sell some product to them. This could be the deal that takes the company forward, at least a baby step. 

Now to entertain the negative people, lets assume this is all a scam. Even if its all a hoax, their website/service homemedy.com and a corresponding mobile app is set to launch in the first quarter of FY17. Release of this news alone will drive the stock up, probably to nickels and dimes.

• We want high volatility stock

•	We want a stock with a beta &gt;1

•	We want a higher liquidity, ergo more volume. At least 50,000-100,000 

•	Shareholder =  Stakeholder = Stockholder

•	Dividends: portions of company’s earnings that are distributed to shareholders

•	Common Stock: more, ability to vote, paid last in bankruptcy

•	Preferred Stock: rarer, can’t usually vote, paid before common shareholders in bankruptcy

•	Bonds: you loan money to government or corporation and make money through interest. 

•	Outstanding shares: total amount of stocks held by stockholders. Not the same as number of stocks available. 

•	Float: total number of shares available on the market. It is Closely held shares – Outstanding shares. 

•	Capital Gains Tax: tax owed on stock gains 




**Trading Styles**

•	Day trader: execute multiple trades by buying and selling intraday

•	Intraday: any time period that occurs during the course of a single day.
 
•	Commission Fee: avg. around $10, charged each time you buy or sell

•	Swing Trading: places trades and holds more than a day. Sometimes holds stocks for weeks or months. 

•	Scalping: An illegal practice in which an individual or group of individuals will recommend stock to be highly valuable to unsuspecting traders and/or investors. As they buy the stock when the price rises, the manipulative individual(s) sell their portion of the stock, making a profit, while the unsuspecting traders and/or investors get left with worthless stock. (This is actually a pump and dump, this guy’s an idiot)

•	Scalping: Placing numerous trades and holding a position for minutes or seconds, making very little percentage gains per trade. 

•	Position Trader: places trades on a monthly or yearly basis. 

•	High-Frequency Trader: placing millions of trades per day at the millisecond level. Conducted by a computer. 

•	Look up the Flash Crash of May 6th, 2010

•	More than 50% of all stocks are traded by HFTs

•	(Spouts on about how evil hedge funds hacked the AP twitter to crash stocks momentarily)

•	Algorithmic Trading: Pre-programmed computer code that distributes commands to an electronic platform, which then issues automated orders.
 
•	Trend Trading: buy and hold trends in a stock. 

o	Tip: a lot of trends in biotech and Pharma industries. Also, energy experience trends. 

o	Most penny stocks trend sideways(yay)

•	Momentum Trading: momentum trading is often confused with being the same as trend trading. This is wrong. Volume is the differentiating factor. Trend trading can be short or long term but momentum trading is almost always short term.

•	Momentum formula is bunk. It is last price – closing price x days ago. This is just a difference in prices. 

•	He does some fancy analogy about a car and soccer ball but he’s just getting at that volume is the differentiating factor. 

•	Contrarian: Investors or traders with views contrary to the standard norm or status quo. More needless stories about Copernicus and MLK Jr. 

•	(Goes super neckbeard about having contrarian mindset and how most people aren’t smart enough to possess this mindset.) 

•	Breakout Trader: stocks generate patterns based on historical price levels. Those price levels form very explicit patterns and when those patterns are broke, there is usually a lot of volatility. 

•	Market Capitalization: appraises the overall size of a company.

o	Market cap = outstanding shares x stock price

•	Mega cap – Large cap – Mid cap – Small cap – Micro cap – Nano cap

•	Penny stocks are small caps and below. 

•	Market cap doesn’t equal the value of the company. (doesn’t explain what does)

•	(CORRELATION DOES NOT EQUAL CAUSATION. He took 10 minutes to explain this)

•	(Correlations are represented by Pearson’s R.)

o	(Range from -1 to 1. 0 means there is no relationship.)
 
o	Some stocks are strongly correlated, one goes up, buy the strongly correlated stock to it. 

•	There is a correlation between market caps and risk/reward

o	Larger market caps – lower risk/reward

o	Smaller market cap – higher risk reward

**What moves stock prices?**

•	Stocks prices are driven by the law of supply and demand

•	Stock prices don’t move if there isn’t any volume

•	Humans and their self-interests control supply and demand in the stock market. 

•	Demand: who is willing and able to buy various quantities of stock at various possible prices

16-12-10,5hm51y,Considering an in-service rollover of 401k - Thoughts?,"Over the years, the investment options in my company 401k plan have been dwindling down.  There are very few funds remaining with low expenses other than company stock (which I won't touch) and the Fidelity 500 Index Fund.  Every remaining option has an expense ratio of at least 0.33%, with most of them at 0.5% or higher.  The options themselves aren't great; the plan seems to want to move us into T Rowe Price target date funds, all of which have 0.54% expense ratios.

I learned recently that I can do an in-service distribution on the portion of the account that's based on the rollover from my previous employer (contribution and earnings), ie, do a rollover without actually leaving the company.  My understanding is so long as I roll it over into a qualified IRA, the distribution won't be subject to taxes or early withdrawal penalties.  I'm considering moving this portion of my 401k into something like Vanguard.  I've read various articles on the Interwebs listing reasons why I shouldn't do this:  I can't take a loan against an IRA like a 401k (which I'd never do anyway); I can't take penalty-free distributions from an IRA until I'm 59.5 as opposed to 55 w/ 401k, and ""beware higher fees"", which I doubt will happen if I'm invested in low cost index funds.

At present, nearly 50% of the value of my 401k is based on the rollover from my previous company.  What's the consensus?",1

I have been trying to setup an account with Suretrader for a long time. Their application process is very poorly designed (it was much easier to open an account with TOS or Scottrade). Every time I try to upload documents for the account signup process the website times out. I have had so much trouble with just doing the various things to get an account started.  I have emailed and called Suretrader a dozen times, but nothing gets resolved. Even just recently, I tried to sign in to try again and a warning comes up saying ""we have changed our bank wire process"", ok good to know. But each time I go to sign in, this same warning keeps popping up until I get locked out of my account. This was the last straw. Also, their demo account does not look well designed. They have done everything to keep me from giving them money.

I am done with Suretrader, I am not going to trust them with my money if they can't even run a website.

16-12-11,5hoqkr,"Made a few million, now I need some life direction","Ok. Not sure the best way to put all this. First off, I love reading reddit but rarely have time to. Always forget my username and have to create a new account.. So that's that. I'm 25 years old. Over the past several years, I have managed to start and grow a business beyond anything I ever expected. I'm very grateful and fortunate to be where I'm at today. However, this is also my best kept secret. I don't like to talk about how much I make with people, and it's very difficult to find people to relate to. Also, nobody wants to listen to someone talk about their problems when they are raking it in like that. So.. due to external circumstances, I will be winding down the business I've been so successful in. I have a couple other things brewing, although as with any new business they will take some time, and I'm just not so sure I will be able to achieve the same level of success.

My reason for posting here:

Stocks have always interested me. I have done a bit of ""dabbling"". I have an account with $100k in it. I've messed around with lots of discretionary trading, including swing trading and day trading. However, it's been difficult to commit serious time to it, as my work keeps me busy. And I know that until trading becomes my job, I won't ever be good at it. 

Here's what I seem to have figured out. 

- Most people say that you can't make money trading stocks. People in the finance industry me how much people lose, how low the success rate is, etc. I reject this. I think there are doubters and naysayers about every business. If I let these people dissuade me, I wouldn't be where I'm at today. BUT, maybe this is an instance where I should heed? I like to think I'm a sharp guy, and that my past success would indicate that I may just have a knack for something like trading. Then again, maybe that's just all ego. I do know I have serious work ethic, and I'm definitely no dummy.

- I don't like tips. I don't want to know what other people think (in regards to stock picks). I don't want to invest based on things I hear from other people. If I do any of this, I am not actually learning how to make money trading. I am just gambling based on things other people tell me. If I do pursue trading as a source of income, I need to know how to trade myself.

- I don't think day trading is for me. It's a lot like a casino. I have trouble removing the emotion from the equation and looking at everything subjectively. Also, I would rather not have to be glued in front of the screen all day to avoid disaster. I have no problem putting in 60-70 hour work weeks, but appreciate trading in a longer time frame that allows for a little more analysis and thought to go into things.

- I am only really interested in technical analysis. Specifically, I think I could be successful system trading through technical analysis. I reckon I can do this without being a statistician or math wizard. But perhaps that is not the case? Would really love to here thoughts on that, from anyone WITH experience system trading. I really like the concept of being able to develop a system, back test, make adjustments, tweak and fine tune components, etc. This would also allow me to trade without less worry about the discipline required. I know that no matter what kind of trading I do, if I want to be successful I need to do it without emotion. By system trading, I can definitely achieve this. 



So... Here I am. I have serious money to trade with if I desire. As I wind down my current business, I will have the time open up that I have always lacked to devote to trading. So here is the question I pose to myself, and am looking to others for their thoughts..

Can I learn how to trade stocks, to the point that I can reliably  make serious income over time? 

I know there will be ups and downs, or even good years and bad years. But I do believe there are traders out there that are ""good"" enough that they can trade as a job, and achieve their financial goals. 

Should I pursue trading as a full time endeavor? If / When I am not successful initially, how many months / years should I devote to it before throwing the towel in? 

Ultimately, these are all things I need to determine myself. Any new endeavor will bring with it risk and a degree of uncertainty. I would welcome thoughts and experience from anyone who can relate to any pieces of this. 

PS

I am currently set up with Schawb. That's where my retirement accounts are, and so I have my personal trading account with them as well. I use Street Smart Edge. I likely will need to move to a more trader friendly platform. 

I am looking to get set up with Trade Station, as a tool that will fit my desire to explore system trading. Anything good or bad anything has to say about Trade Station for system trading would be helpful.

16-12-11,5hrfb4,(CAD) Trying to figure out if it is a good idea to invest in Tesla during the annual winter stock price drop.,"hey guys. i am looking for some advice on what i should know when considering buying stock. i know a few basics like never drop all investment money into one stock or project, if something is supported strongly by its government then it is much less likely to go belly up, so at some point you may be able to break even or make a profit with patience.

Disclaimer: i have read the investing forum but most of it goes much over my head so that is why i have come here, also most of it applies to people who are looking for retirement funds, which for me is not the case.

as per the title i am looking to buy stock from Tesla due to its success as a company, many acquired assets and the general stable financial situation it appears to be in. (if any of what i just said is incorrect please inform me). as per the trend after its initial take off the stock prices are on the decline once again and i was considering investing in it and selling in March- June when prices usually peak again.

i currently have 4500$ (CAD) or 3414.26 (USD) and am saving 125 dollars a week towards this. so until the stock prices drop a 
bit more i will continue to keep saving.

questions: 
1. With this amount of money would it be worth trying to invest any of it?
2. How much of this should i invest. Back round: currently 17 years old living with parents until college with no bills and a part time job to supply this 125$ a week in savings.
3. If i properly plan and use this money is there any chance i could come out in 5 years with no student debt? Approximately 35K not including living expenses. with living expenses about 71K.
4. should i look at another type of stock instead of Tesla for my goals?
5. Due to my not needing money for living or education currently, would it still be a bad idea to drop all of the money into the one stock or should i still find more stocks to spread it around on?

If i have left anything out that would be pertinent to the decision then you can PM me or just leave a comment i am a 6 times an hour checker so don't worry about responses i am quite attentive.

Any insight is more then welcome even if it is saying that i am making all the wrong choices, all i want is advice that provides me with the best outcome, whether i like it or not. Thanks r/investing.",0

After the recent explosion (SpaceX blew up an Amos 6 satellite on the launchpad due to a fueling procedure problem) I noticed that Iridium (IRDM) dropped significantly in price.

Since then it has gone up drastically.  So my question is: how good of an investment strategy is it to follow technical markets closely and buy based on market overreactions like this?  Is this stock just a rare example or are there other things like it where people get scared and sell based on a big ticket news item like a rocket explosion?

When the government stepped in and made Fannie and Freddie a GSE, and yes...they started becoming very much profitable again because they were bailed out by the government. Well...ya..too bad. The government threw them a lifejacket, so as a shareholder it sucks, but you lost your stake and rights to return as soon as that company went bankrupt.

Did other private institutions such as banks get bailouts? Yes. Banks like Goldman also paid billions of earnings in interest to the fed. did they not?

I'm just curious where this shareholder entitlement is coming from? Maybe i'm completely wrong... I have no Idea...someone please shed some light...",11
16-12-12,5hu19v,Academic research at its best: Hedge fund managers and sports cars,"We've seen a couple of posts here recently about how to get into the hedge fund business. This new study provides some practical advice with regards to choice of automobile to those kids wanting to get into the game.

[Sensation Seeking, Sports Cars, and Hedge Funds](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2882983)

*Abstract:*

We find that hedge fund managers who own powerful sports cars take on more investment risk. Conversely, managers who own practical but unexciting cars take on less investment risk. The incremental risk taking by performance car buyers does not translate to higher returns. Consequently, they deliver lower Sharpe ratios than do car buyers who eschew performance. In addition, performance car owners are more likely to terminate their funds, engage in fraudulent behavior, load up on non-index stocks, exhibit lower R-squareds with respect to systematic factors, and succumb to overconfidence. We consider several alternative explanations and conclude that manager revealed preference in the automobile market captures the personality trait of sensation seeking, which in turn drives manager behavior in the investment arena.",99

16-12-12,5hu6q8,"Trump's negative rhetoric towards China will be major risks for $GM and $SBUX","Just today, Trump said that the US needs to reconsider the ""One China Policy"". 
http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/11/politics/donald-trump-china-taiwan/index.html

I'm afraid that this is just the beginning. Trump seems to love Russia but hate China. This interesting love triangle is a major risk for $GM and $SBUX as both are seeing increased revenues from China.

Especially with $GM, China is their biggest market. Chinese consumers are known to be highly sentimental and are known to boycott products from countries that there is negative coverage on. For example, when Japan voiced complaints about China's claim to the Senkaku Islands in 2012, Chinese citizens started to launch a large-scale boycott movement against Japanese car manufacturers and even started to vandalize Japanese-branded cars on the streets. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_China_anti-Japanese_demonstrations
http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/09/how-chinas-mainstream-media-ignored-the-anti-japanese-riots/262879/
Increase oil prices (which are rising more than expected) will also hurt GM's sales of its gasoline/diesel models. GM's electric vehicle expansion may be a good move, however they are selling their EVs for a loss in order to expand market share. 

$SBUX has an ambitious plan to expand their operations in China and envisions that their biggest market will be China. However, its stock price may be hit during Trump's presidency as, again, the highly sentimental Chinese citizens will launch boycott campaigns through social media and other channels. 

Therefore, there may be limited upside for $GM and $SBUX and any other companies that have significant exposure to the Chinese market. ",2

16-12-11,5hs5uq,Looking for some portfolio advice,"About a month ago I put 30k in vanguard and since then have added some cash. Here is my current portfolio:

* VTSAX currently $12,934 (contributed $12,500)
* BLV currently $4,918 (contributed $5000)
* FNMA currently $3,539( added $3,000 to buy this a few weeks ago)
**total portfolio is currently valued at 34,335**($33,200 contributed)

I also have an automatic contribution setup for VBIAX and VTSAX of $100 each that comes out at the first of the month( so far I've one month of contributions have been added)

I am a 30 year old guy that is looking to use this money in 3-5 years. If my portfolio is trying to recover from any kind of crash I would be willing to keep it in for as long as I need to. 

I'm at a 70/30 split between stocks and bonds because I want to be risky but not so risky that my portfolio would totally tank on a crash. 

I know my FNMA buy is very risky but I have read and research and gambling that this will be a huge stock in the coming months if some things go in my favor. 

So my questions are:
I'm a little nervous of a crash in the next 6-12 months but I don't really want to just sit on the money waiting for something that may never happen. Are these to risky for what I'm trying to accomplish? If so what are some less risky funds I could do that wouldn't be a money market account or ally bank?

Since I'm putting in the $200 a month should I just let it ride since that will help out my dollar cost average? I could also probably put in more money if it does start to tank. 

I'm just curious on what others would recommend so any advice or thoughts on my portfolio would be greatly appreciated. ",0

16-12-12,5hxnuz,How to Invest in Equity Crowdfunding?!,"Want to invest like the rich do? Now's your chance – to a point.

The Securities and Exchange Commission is now allowing individuals to invest in companies via web-based crowdfunding portals, known as intermediaries, via the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS act.

Historically only venture capitalists and accredited investors – essentially the wealthiest 2 percent of the country – were allowed to invest in startups and small businesses, says Ryan Feit, CEO and co-founder of SeedInvest, an equity crowdfunding platform that funded over 65 companies with more than 100,000 investors.

""Now the number of potential investors in private companies skyrockets from about 370,000 active angel investors in the country to 240 million Americans. That's a big deal. It effectively enables kickstarter with equity,"" Felt says.

Big risks. These are risky investments, and all experts say investors should be prepared to lose everything as new businesses fail more often than established companies. Feit says on average these investments should comprise around 2 to 3 percent an investment portfolio and no more than 5 to 10 percent.

""This has to be discretionary money that you can afford to lose, that you can afford to sit on for years,"" Swart says.

The stocks are considered illiquid so investors might not be able to sell them for a long time and at a minimum, investors are restricted from selling shares in the first year except under very limited circumstances.

What to ask before investing. Find out what you can about the company's founders, their relative experience and the cost of building up that business, says David Mandelbrot, CEO of Indiegogo.

Investors need to know their rights and ask potential companies, ""What happens to me the day after I send you my money?"" Swart says.

Potential investors can interact with each other via forums. The forums allow investors to see what questions are being asked, which will likely prompt other follow-up questions and the ""wisdom of the crowd"" will rise above any startup.

Ask about dividends, Swart says. Will those be a check or will goods from the startup be considered a dividend? Will owners get to vote during board meetings? How will the company communicate to investors – do they get an annual letter once a year or can they go to a stockholder meeting? How will the company use the proceeds?

Invest in industries you know. ""For the nonprofessional investor, it's probably better for you to look at deals where you understand the market,"" Swart says.",0

16-12-11,5hssyt,Hypothetical question regarding slush fund,"Hi All,

  I am new to investing and trading. I have no desire at the present moment to use my capital in any real world scenarios. I am learning and will  employ  virtual means  to exercise any of the concepts that I am learning regarding the allocation of said funds.

Hypothetically speaking, If I had $50,000 dollars that I could afford to lose, but wanted to invest AND  trade those funds at the same time . Would it be imprudent to allocate 80% to investing (regardless of  term) and 20% to swing trading. I can afford to lose it all but I am only willing to lose the 20% in trading.  I am willing to lose the 80% but considering my investment philosophy I dont think my conservative approach would lead to a total loss.

It seems to me the consensus is that long term investing yields greater returns over the long term but swing trading could yield immediate profit. So if I'm willing to risk the 20% is there any reasonable argument not to do it. Assuming of course I have some idea as to what I'm doing at the time I trade.


All in all I want the latitude and longitude to exercise prudence but not at the expense of the thrill of being aggressive. At 47 and considering my other assets I can afford the risk.

# Description
Coty Inc. is a beauty company operating in: Fragrances, Color Cosmetics and Skin &amp; Body Care. 

Its fragrance brands include Calvin Klein, Marc Jacobs, Davidoff, Chloe, Balenciaga, Beyonce, Bottega Veneta, Miu Miu and Roberto Cavalli. Its cosmetics brands include Bourjois, Rimmel, Sally Hansen and OPI. Its skin &amp; body care brands are adidas, Lancaster, philosophy and Playboy. 

So a oddly enough you or a love one probably know a Coty brand, even if you've never heard of the parent company. And imagine, it's been in business since 1904. 

## Recent financials 

Note: it's a June year end business. Though these figures are largely unrepresentative, given the acquisition of Procter &amp; Gamble's cosmetic's business that closed on 1st October this year.

|Metric|2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $4.3bn | $4.4bn | $4.6bn | $4.6bn | $4.6bn|
|EPS | $0.44 | $0.64 | -$0.26 | $0.42 | -$0.87|
|DPS | $0.25 | $0.20 | $0.20 | $0.15 | N/A|

The purchase price was $11.5bn and it more than doubled the size of the company. Here's the comparison of the old Coty with the proform Coty+P&amp;G Beauty for the 3 months to Sept.

|Metric|Old Coty|New Coty|
|:---|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $1.1bn | $2.1bn | 
|EPS | $0.00 | -$0.26 | 

NB: the proforma business didn't grow in the 3 months to Sept. :(

## Competition

Looking at the pre-merger stats, the margins are good, the returns are not, when compared with the peers. And with the massive increase in equity after the P&amp;G deal, it's hard to see the returns improving. Though for now, I suppose we should focus on the benefits of putting these two businesses together.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Coty Inc | $4,317M | 24% | 6%
L'Oreal SA | €25,257M | 21% | 15%
Avon Products, Inc. | $5,026M | 10% | N/A
Estee Lauder Companies Inc | $11,293M | 19% | 31%
Revlon Inc | $2,055M | 17% | N/A
Inter Parfums, Inc. | $505M | 15% | 8%

Though given Coty just agreed to buy [GHD for $500m as well](http://investors.coty.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=251569&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=2224795) it's going to be hard to identify the exact synergies. 

In fact the key is whether you believe in their $750m synergies figure over 4 years, increasing margin from 14% to 20% to get to a premium to the sector which is operating at at 16 to 18% margin. Here's the Coty [factsheet](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9MzU0MDY3fENoaWxkSUQ9LTF8VHlwZT0z&amp;t=1&amp;cb=636108490076332414).

## Cash / Debt?

Coty Inc has $3,989M of net debt. That is 3.9x it's latest operating profit. Have to say, I get worried when debt levels are that high. 

But, I am not convinced that Reuters is calculating the figures correctly. Though if they are 14% operating margin on $9bn of sales and the pro-forma debt is $6bn, then the leverage multiple is even higher, circa 5x.


# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $22.30 for Coty Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 16% to their target.

# Valuation

It's not clear the market's got faith in their ability to deliver on the synergies! At 21x it's hardly a demanding valuation for a business that should see double digit growth operationally, let alone deleverage.

Okay, it's not far off EL's valuation, but if we are moving into a tightening cycle, isn't it cyclical stocks that own the day?

Coty Inc is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.36 per share, compared with a forecast EPS of $0.93. So nice to see, they are still paying divies, even though they have a high debt burden. Hubris or confidence?

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -22% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -17%. Ouch. It didn't help that they missed earnings and revenues in the Sept quarter and are talking about a difficult Dec quarter and that the year to June 2017 is a transition year. 

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, despite the profit warning they said

&gt; We also remain committed to our previously communicated adjusted EPS target of at least $1.53 for fiscal 2020, despite the profit impact of the current decline in revenues.

Let's do a back of the envelope. Let's value that at 15x to 20x. That would give you a 4% to 13% capital gain and then there's the 2% divie on top. *Exciting* at the top end, only.

So... do you think they'll be successful in merging the 2 businesses? If so, why wait? Or is it better to wait until the signs are in on the Dec quarter. Let the bad news play its course.

Somehow, I don't see the risk reward, given the integration risk, leverage risk, and market risk. Sure the brands are strong, but I'd prefer to see some more bad news and an irrationally low price ;). Just doesn't feel irrationally lowe yet!

2. Some of it is categorized under long-term capital gain and some under short-term capital gain. If the stock has always gone up for all bunches is there any reason not to gift the short-term capital gain stock first?

16-12-12,5hygoi,BOJ to consider tightening????,"&gt; The latest buzz in Japanese monetary-policy circles is that the BOJ may have to lift the 10-year government-bond target from a recently set zero..... As yields rise around the world—led by the U.S., whose Federal Reserve is expected to raise rates on Dec. 14—the gap between Japan and other markets widens. That draws money out of Japan as investors search for better returns, which puts further pressure on the yen..... For Abenomics skeptics, the yen’s deteriorating prospects ring alarm bells.  BNP Paribas chief Japan economist Ryutaro Kono said in a recent note for clients that a fall to ¥115 to the dollar could upset consumers by raising the cost of living. When BOJ easing weakened the yen to ¥125 to the dollar from ¥110 between autumn 2014 and summer of 2015, it cast a chill over the economy as rising costs for imported food and necessities battered consumers while companies held back from raising wages. Other Japanese economists say the BOJ may have to raise its bond-yield target just to give more breathing room to the country’s banks, whose profits are dwindling as their longer-term lending rates fall dangerously close to what they’re paying on deposits.

&gt; [“Is it a time to worry about ‘easing too much’?” asked one person close to the BOJ.](http://www.wsj.com/articles/for-the-bank-of-japan-a-tightening-squeeze-1481450977)

16-12-12,5hwdgt,Bogle Calls for Regulation of ETF Trading,"TL;DR - ETF's aren't magic ponies. Stop speculating with them, you're harming your returns

[Excerpts from the FT:
](https://www.ft.com/content/f406d50c-bbcf-11e6-8b45-b8b81dd5d080)

- In 1976, I created the first Tif. It was named First Index Investment Trust (now Vanguard 500 Index Fund). Its **purpose was to provide a long-term investment in the US stock market at rock-bottom cost**

- In 1993, Nathan Most created the first ETF...proposed using Vanguard’s 500 Index Fund in a new structure, one that would **enable investors to trade the index fund, “all day long, in real time”**. I could not agree with such a trading mentality. Time and again, clear statistical evidence has confirmed that the more investors trade, the more their returns fall short of the stock market return. I turned down his offer.

- Mr Most turned to State Street Global Advisors to implement his creation. The result: the SPDR (Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Depository Receipts), still the largest ETF.

- Tifs and ETFs presently hold assets of about $2.4tn. Since 2008, both have grown at an annual rate of about 18%

- 80% of the assets of today’s 425 Tifs assets are broadly diversified funds, 15% in “strategic beta” funds, and 4% in speculative strategies and concentrated sectors and regions

- For ETF's; 43% of assets are in broadly diversified funds, 31% in strategic beta, and 25% in speculative and less diversified strategies.

- Individual investors are by far the largest holders of the Vanguard Tifs, with annual redemption rates in the range of 8%

- Banks and financial intermediaries hold almost 90% of SPDR S&amp;P 500, where the **dollar value of annual turnover typically runs to some 3,000% of assets.**

- **Tif investor returns were a few basis points higher than fund returns** in each of the five largest Vanguard broad-market index funds. In contrast, **returns earned by the firm’s ETF investors (the identical underlying portfolios) trailed the returns of the funds by an average of 1.6%** during the same period. 

- ETFs’ impact on stock trading has reached mammoth proportions. **They account for nearly one-half of all trading in US stocks**. So far in 2016, the dollar volume of trading in the 100 largest ETFs has totalled $13.0tn. Trading in the stocks of the 100 largest US corporations totalled $13.9tn

- Since 2007, investors have redeemed $747bn on balance of their holdings of actively managed equity funds and purchased $1.65tn of passively managed equity index funds

-  the annualised turnover rates are different in magnitude: stock turnover, 120%; ETF turnover 880%",42

16-12-12,5hz796,LGF STARZ merger (transaction mechanics?),"First a repeat of my thanks to the previous thread that caused me to notice a bit of important news I had overlooked:  
  
https://redd.it/5fk36k
  
Because of that thread I already recognized some previously unrealized long term losses, so this sudden chunk of unplanned short term gains won't be taxed this year nor taxed as short term.  As things are currently trending, if the CI merger happens next year, the STARZ merger just used up losses that would have balanced CI next year, so the STARZ merger this year hits my taxes as long term gain on CI next year.  
  
But I would still like to know transaction details sooner than Merrill Edge is likely to post them.  My STRZA stock went away today, but I expect it will take longer before I get LGF'B stock and even longer before I know its cost basis.  My gain is somewhat under the $18 per share cash portion of the deal, so my cost basis in LGF'B should be the **fair market value of LGF'B as of exactly when??**  
  
Then my short term gain is the sum of that cost basis in LGF'B plus the $18 per share of STRZA (that I haven't gotten yet) minus my original cost basis in STRZA (with some small messy adjustment for the fractional share of LGF'B).  
  
My question is the part above in bold, but anything else someone wants to add about the timing or mechanics of the transaction may be helpful.

16-12-12,5hzdjf,The attack on Cash and the case for gold?,"Recently finished reading the book, ""The Curse of Cash"" - Rogoff (https://www.amazon.com/Curse-Cash-Kenneth-S-Rogoff-ebook/dp/B01EMADYJ2)

It lays out a pretty compelling argument against cash. The gist of the book says that cash makes crime easier. Crimes including tax evasion, money laundering and black market transactions(including hiring illegal workers, drugs, guns, prostitution, etc). He highlights the anonymity that cash provides as main reason and main problem for law abiding citizens of our society.

He goes further mentioning that there's a very large amount of unaccounted for bills. An amount so large that there's no reasonable legal use for it. Rogoff argues that it must of in the hands of criminals. Just to put into perspective how much cash is floating around, here's a quote, 

""Almost 80% of the US currency supply is in $100 bills. How many people have 34 of them in their purses, cookie jars, or cars, as each individual would need to account for his or her share? And this is for every man, woman and child, so a four-person family would need to be holding $13,600 just in $100 bills, and that is not counting smaller bills.""

As many of you may be aware of, Rogoff has some good political connections since his previous book (""This Time is Different"" - Reinhart and Rogoff)  was used as the playbook for austerity.

Recently with the attacks on cash in India and now Venezuela, I wonder how fast and how far this idea can travel. I think it's only a matter of time before China is forced to enact something similar. Meaning, the two largest consumers of gold, will likely consume even more.

Alright, so you might be thinking, ""How is gold going to rise, in a rising interest rate environment?""

I believe as interest rates rise and government begins to feel the pressure(higher interest expenses) they will look to new areas of taxation. I believe attempts to tax illegal activities may be very easy(at least politically). If you had a choice tax legal or illegal activities, I think it would be pretty easy to choose.

This isn't exactly a popular opinion around investment circles. I get it, gold sucks. It doesn't produce income, you'd be better in property, etc. I know the arguments. However, I think the anonymity that cash provides is often overlooked. Gold also provides this anonymity and if cash loses this anonymity(globally!!), then I believe we could see gold move much higher from here(over and above the rate of inflation!). 

From a sentiment perspective, there's a good argument to be made as well. Fundamentally, the story for gold has strengthened considerably(Attacks on cash) in the last few months, but gold continues to trade lower(since July). Also, combined with the fact that most people hate gold, it seems like a decent contrarian play.

Potential? To put this into perspective Rogoff estimates that the underground economy accounts for around ~10% of GDP in most developed economies(http://imgur.com/L7R4x4z). In the US (See chart) it is estimated that the underground economy accounts for 7.7% of GDP. If we take 7.7% of US GDP we have $1,256B(http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp). If we then estimate that 1% of that money will move to gold given an attack on cash(probably MORE) we have $12.56B. These are merely estimations, but it gives you an idea of how large of a move something like this could mean. Gold is the ONLY market large enough to allow for an escape from cash.

I'm sure there'll be several comments about bitcoins, but I have some security concerns and I think it would be too easy for governments to close the avenues of exchange(websites). Also, as mentioned above, I don't believe the bitcoin market is large enough.

Rogoff also makes the case against cash, because it would solve our negative interest rate concerns(If interest rates are negative, what's stopping people from sitting on cash under their mattress?). This may be a stronger case against cash( at least politically), than crime alone. Thinking about this now, negative interest rates would effectively kill the argument, ""Oh, but gold doesn't earn interest!""(At least for money in your bank account).

**TL:DR** The recent attacks on cash make a compelling argument for gold.",0

16-12-12,5hwvjl,"Taxes &amp; Fees: Considerations for Short-Term Investing","Both the [trending value](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/4qldg6/trending_value_breaking_down_a_proven/) and [consumer staples](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/4s5p0q/consumer_staples_shareholder_yield_higher_returns/) strategies I've introduced work well with annual rebalancing, which is great because gains you make on stocks that were held for more than a year are subject to a lower capital gains tax rate. Gains from stocks that were held for less than a year are subject to your ordinary income tax rate.

 [Capital Gains Tax Rates in the United States, 2016](http://imgur.com/e9cZfgA)

There are real tax benefits to holding stocks for more than a year, but there are also benefits to trading more frequently:
 
[Strategy Statistics vs Trading Frequencies, 1/2/99 - 12/7/16](http://imgur.com/j2t7Ake)

To help determine if the increased return from trading more frequently is worth the higher tax rate, let's review an example:

**Long-term**: I invest $1,000 in the trending value strategy on Day 1. I sell on day 366, my capital gain for the year being $1,000 * 16.1% = $161. Because I'm in the 25% tax bracket, I have to pay 15% of that gain in taxes, $161 * 15% = $24.15, so my end balance after tax is $1,000 + $161 - $24.15 = $1,136.85.

**Short-term**: I invest $1,000 in the trending value strategy on Day 1 and rebalance monthly. By day 366, my capital gain is $1,000 * 20.9% = $209. Because I'm in the 25% tax bracket and I traded more frequently, my capital gains are subject to my ordinary income tax rate, $209 * 25% = $52.25, so my end balance after tax is $1,000 + $209 - $52.25 = $1,156.75.

After taxes, the monthly version of the trending value finishes ahead of the annual version by **$19.90**. Trading these two strategies more frequently returns more before taxes, but after taxes it's close to even. (It looks like the trending value strategy does not benefit beyond monthly, which makes sense since the ranking system uses 6 month % return). 

There are, however, many strategies that benefit tremendously with more frequent trading because they are able to react more quickly to opportunities as they arise. Increased trading frequency also ensures that you aren't stuck in a poor position because of a poor entry point (What Works on Wall Street demonstrates that the return of an annual strategy can vary widely depending on which month you enter, partly due to the ever-shifting [January effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_effect)).

To help make this decision whether to trade once a year or more frequently without having to go through an example every time, I've created a table. It shows the nominal gain required if trading long-term or short term.

Comparing the two columns within each tax bracket indicates the additional return required to offset the tax implication.

 
[Overcoming Capital Gains Taxes](http://imgur.com/JvFn4Db)

*One caveat to the table is that if your ordinary income is right below the next highest tax bracket, and adding short term capital gains on top of that pushes the total into the higher bracket, the portion of short term capital gains that fit into the higher tax bracket will be taxed at that higher tax rate (read more [here](http://money.stackexchange.com/questions/28968/how-are-long-term-capital-gains-taxed-if-the-gain-pushes-income-into-a-new-tax-b)). If this is the case, you can compare an LT column to the ST column in the next highest bracket.*

If you're trading a quantitative strategy inside of a 401(k), you don't have capital gains taxes to worry about. But you do have trading commissions to worry about. Fidelity charges $7.95 a trade; some charge more, some less, but it's typically around there. 

Assuming $10 a trade and a 25 stock portfolio (to make the numbers more even), the trading costs (as a percentage of your portfolio) for different rebalance schedules and portfolio sizes are summarized below:
 
[Trading Fee for Various Trading Frequencies for a 25 Stock Portfolio](http://imgur.com/4KewQRC)

I've highlighted in green 2% and lower, which is about the most you would expect to be charged for an actively managed fund. 

So if you're not indexing, whatever your portfolio size and the trading frequency you choose to implement, make sure that your expected return above the benchmark index is greater than your taxes and fees.

Robinhood offers trades for $0, which can significantly lower the barrier to entry to short-term strategies (and trading in general) for ordinary investors without a lot of capital. There are valid criticisms (including on execution of trades, which matters more the more often you trade), but despite the criticisms $0/trade is hard to beat.",1

16-12-13,5i5ipj,Two financial analysis questions,"1. A bit of a broad question, but as I understand stock prices today reflect all future cash flows, does this imply that daily it seems people are believing companies will continually generate higher and higher cash flows? Since the Trump rally began I'm pretty stocks are a bit overvalued anyway, but I'm just a bit confused on the analysis in terms of setting the current prices. In other words, are people changing their analysis of a company's future cash flows daily or is there something I'm not catching?
2. I was looking over BoA's financial statements, and for their revenue it lists ""deposits"" as a source and lists it as a source of interest income. They also have interest income from loans separately listed, so I'm just confused as to what interest income could be coming directly from deposits since they list interest income from loans separately.

Thank you in advance!",2

16-12-13,5i60af,MFI and RSI relationship,"I've recently been looking into correlations between the difference of a stock's MFI and RSI, and its stock price. MFI basically measures momentum in a stock using price changes and volume. 50 is average, under 20 is oversold, and over 80 is overbought. RSI, on the other hand, measures the speed of stock price movements without the input of volume. The values are similar in meaning to MFI. My thesis is that when there is a large difference between these two metrics, something big is about to happen to that stock. There is sort of a cognitive dissidence between where the momentum(MFI) is pulling the stock and where the stock is actually moving(RSI). If MFI is sitting more than 20 points above RSI, this would signal that the momentum wants this stock to go higher, but the market isn't budging. A move downward is likely for this stock. For example, ULTA's MFI is at 15.83 atm while its RSI 55.88. To me, this means that the vast amount of pressure from the market is downward, but there is another force causing the stock to remain stable. With ULTA's stock price rising today and MFI still dropping, there is likely to be a large upward move in price over the next couple of days. We'll see how this actually pans out, but I think this could be an interesting metric to look at. 
Please feel free to pick apart my reasoning here because I'm sure there is a lot wrong with this.",12

16-12-13,5i3ik3,$AMD to skyrocket. New $AMD GPUs vastly outperform Nvidia GPUs for the same price.,"Overclock.net, WCCFTech, HardOCP, etc are all talking about jumping ship from Nvidia ($NVDA)/Intel ($INTC) to $AMD.
http://wccftech.com/amd-vega-performance-8gb-hbm2/

This is after today's reports from WCCFTech that $AMD's new GPU, the AMD RX490, which uses the new HBM2 3D-stacked DRAM interface manufactured by Samsung/Hynix, vastly outperformed the Nvidia GTX 1080.

This is actually huge news as most analysts were expecting the RX490 to just match the GTX 1080 in performance or only slightly exceed it. However, it exceeded it by a long shot.

$AMD will regain a huge portion of market share in the coming months, so I really expect $AMD to be at $20+ by end of 2017. Take this from a guy who knows a lot about the graphics card market. 

And now $AMD is starting to prove itself in the CPU front as well. If $AMD can just match $INTC in CPU performance:price ratio, it will lift $AMD up further, and drag $INTC down. 

Today's announcement may lead to high volatility, either up or down 5%. I think the result will be +5% in afterhours/pre-market tomorrow.

I don't see $AMD going below $9, and I think going below $10 will be quite difficult unless they really stuff the conference up.

EDIT: Just looking at $AMD's technical chart, we can see that every time it breaks through the $8~$10 level, it enters a huge bull market and reaches between $30~$40 in the following year/years. So $AMD may even triple or quadruple by the next 1-2 years. Yes, $AMD has increased by 800% over the past 1.5 years, however that does not mean that it can't increase by another 300~400%. Crazier things have happened before (think $AMZN, $NVDA, $TSLA and $NFLX). 

People tend to think that since $NVDA increased by 300% this year, $AMD should go up by about the same amount, not more. The markets are irrational guys. $AMD is still under $15, and market psychology suggests that companies with lower stock prices tend to have higher momentum.

* Completed in vitro research whose findings suggest that BPX-01 may have a significant pharmacokinetic advantage over oral minocycline for the treatment of acne.
* Presented findings that suggest BPX-01 may, for the first time, allow dermatologists to unlock minocycline's full, potent anti-inflammatory properties in the treatment of acne. The study found that minocycline's anti-inflammatory benefits are more effectively delivered to specific target areas with the BPX-01 topical formulation than with the oral formulation, which is the only form currently available to treat acne. The finding is important because recent independent research suggests that inflammation may be a cause of acne and not only – as previously thought – a side effect of the condition.

16-12-13,5i6qj8,"$CHUY's is the new $CMG","Tex-Mex is the new foil wrapped burrito. $CHUY has a great cash-strong-no-debt balance sheet, they are currently very concentrated in TX, but expanding nationwide, with lots of room to grow, at a clip of 20% growth in newlocations, plus positive increases in same restaurant sales. 

They make a great case in their investors presentation that they offer a better deal than Chipotle, like for about the same price you get a sit-down plate or hot restaurant food, plus all you can eat chips and salsa. By my observations, the restaurants are persistently packed and the people who eat there are generally very happy with it. 

So here you have a small cap high growth story, selling at about 38x earnings. How does this compare? Other similar stories, Zoe's selling at 107x earnings, Habit at 68x, Shake Shack at 87x. One should also consider that with rapid expansion of locations, this lags bottom line earnings as those new locations ramp up in sales. So, on the other hand, you have here larger more established companies, that do not have the same high growth potential, selling at very comparable earnings multiples: Papa John's at 35x earnings, Dominos at 40x, Panera at 35x, Dunkin Donuts at 38x. So, in my opinion, I think CHUY's fundamentals justify valuation at those obscene levels comparable to other high growth restaurant peers. 

I am generally a Peter Lyncher by methods, and if you look at the small number of restaurants now, and national potential as to where that can go, there is a case there of just holding on as they expand their way across the country, making sure to keep an eye that the customers eating there are still happy with it along the way.

16-12-14,5i9bk8,Day Trading Stocks on market signals,"TREND TRADE: Long from open, 11/9.

SWING TRADE: Buy from open, 12/14.

DAY/SCALP TRADE: Long.

PRICE TRENDS: TQQQ, up 1 day, TNA up 1 day, UPRO up 1 day.

SETUP:

With short-term breadth once again turning up today within the long-term up trend, tomorrow’s open is again an opportunity to jump on this scary bullet train of a rally as it continues to whoosh by.

Stocks from my nifty-fifty stock list giving new individual buys today were FIVN, LSTR, TRMB, and TWI. Others of note giving individual buys signals for tomorrow included FB, CMCSA, AMZN (might be an option play) and NFLX (ditto the option play).

But virtually all index ETFs, even though overextended, are in play on the short-term breadth signal — TQQQ, TNA, UPRO — for day trades certainly, and possibly swing trades for more than a day.

Much of the prospect for success on this setup will depend on the Fed Reserve decision tomorrow and the market reaction to it.  Just saying…

**UPDATE 12/14 CLOSE:**

Yes, much depends on the market's reaction the Federal Reserve's rate hike.  And the reaction was down and as the market goes so go most stocks. Of the four stocks on buys today from the Nifty-fifty-list, one was up (barely) and three down for a loss of 1.2% on the entire basket. So it goes.",0
16-12-13,5i6r3d,I am thinking about selling VISA,"I have Visa for 4 years now and it has been a great ride. I am now thinking about reducing 80% of my position and buying Mastercard.

My rationale is the following:

- I bought VISA due to the industry they are in, I think digital payment and e-commerce is poised to grow massively and has huge entry barriers, therefore the players in the field will benefit.
- Visa is trading at 38x PE, while MA is at 28x PE.
- They have similar number of employees, similar business model, similar profitability levels.
- I would keep a small position in VISA so I can track it properly and re-enter when the price is more suitable.

16-12-13,5i4bmh,Advice for a beginner,"I'm 20 years old and I just finished up a personal finance class in college. The class caught my attention right away when the book stated that there is no reason why anyone shouldn't be able to make millions of dollars. I thought it was bogus at first, but after learning what to avoid and how to save, and learning about investments I don't think it's quite bogus anymore.

There was a chapter all about investing and it intrigued me because the sooner you save and invest, the better your opportunity is to reach capital gains. I would say I know the basics in investing. I've done research outside the chapter and feel ready to invest, but I need some help of course.

Here's my situation: I have a goal to buy a reliable and fuel efficient car when I am out of college and land a job. So I have 5-6 to save and invest. I am currently putting money away each week into my savings at a set amount, but will increase it when I feel financially safe to. And now I would like to invest. I will use this money to put s down payment on the new car. The initial amount I'd invest would be rather small because I'm a college student who works around minimum wage. But I plan on making contributions monthly. I did some research and came across Acorns which is an app that you can invest in a mutual fund initially and use round ups from usage of debit card and use those as daily contributions to my portfolio. That interested me. But are there better options given my situation?

Any help would be much appreciated, thanks!",5

16-12-14,5i9dyk,"Kinder morgan ($KMI) is still a fine, fine stock investment for 2017.","Natural gas is cheap, clean, and abundant in N. America. Over the long term, it will play a larger part in satisfying rapidly growing energy needs. And as the U.S.'s largest natural-gas transporter, Kinder Morgan is well-positioned to capitalize on its increased use. Kinder Morgan's pipelines are regulated monopolies, and most of the company's income is based on fixed-fee contracts or capacity transport agreements — neither of which are affected by the price of natural gas. While Kinder Morgan's stock has rallied this year even as other energy-related companies have kept suffering, the share price is still down more than 50% over the past couple year since the price collapsed, so we still have a good opportunity. The company's market capitalization is about $48 billion, and it expects to generate distributable cash flow (money available to pay shareholders) of $4.7 billion total by the end of 2016. In other words, we are paying less than 10 times distributable cash flow for a company with high-quality assets and a legendary leader in co-founder and chairman Richard Kinder.

So, some core reasons I am planning to invest: 

*** Lets be real here: the price collapsed because the oil price collapsed. Sympathy fell on the price of natural gas, which actually doesn't effect their cash flow at all: Pipelines they hold are simply toll roads that many companies have no alternative to move their oil around with.

*We're picking up shares at a level that should generate market-beating returns going forward. The stock is trading right around book value, a significant discount to its 2.77 average multiple over the past three years. Meanwhile, it's also trading at just 7.5 times its distributable cash flow (DCF, which, until recently, was pretty much devoted to paying the dividend). Management believes (and I agree) that given the quality and sustained earnings power of its assets, it should trade at about 12 to 14 times DCF. 

*Management and the board are focused on long-term growth via high-return investments.  A classic Buffett'esque tick.

*The company plays a key role in a growing market.

*Decent dividend for the slow ride to recovery.

*The beaten-down share price gives us a good entry point on a proven, stable operator. The sharp decline in the share price offers a great entry for what I believe is a solid company with strong growth prospects. We're looking at a utility with a stable business, attractive growth prospects, first-rate assets, and a founder with proven capital allocation skill invested alongside us.

16-12-13,5i76zg,Granted shares in an LLC. How can I approximate the value?,"I've been granted 4,000 class C shares in an LLC. It seemed great at first, but I spotted a detail in one of the documents that stated an executive was granted 350,000 shares... It was obviously part of negotiating his position because he was hired 1 month ago.

I understand he'd receive much more than me since it's an executive position, but I didn't expect it to be nearly 100X what I'm receiving. That makes me feel like my shares could be nearly worthless.

They won't tell us how many outstanding shares there are, so I don't know how to even begin coming up with a figured. Here are some of the details:

* As I mentioned, a new C-level hire gets 350k
* About 90 other employees are part of this deal. I would expect about 75% of them would receive the same stake as me (4k shares) or less.
* This is the only point shares will be granted to employees. It is not possible to increase our stake, and nobody will be added to the pool going forward.
* The company (software) brings in approximately 100 million in revenue, and is growing quickly.

I'm a slightly underpaid software engineer, but I've been toughing it out knowing this benefit was coming. However, without being able to ballpark the value, I don't know if it's worth sticking around while it vests. I get 1/12 of my 4k annually for 5 years.

For this time period, the number of stocks in these sub-industries in the S&amp;P 500 ranged between 14 and 20. I've abbreviated these as BeSToGaR (Beer, Spirits/Soft Drinks, Tobacco, Gaming, Restaurants).

Only investing in the top 3 of these stocks (as ranked by the 2 factors from a [famous formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_formula_investing)) and rebalancing every 3 months pushes the CAGR a few percentage points higher, though at the expense of a larger drawdown.

Widening the net to include stocks within the [Russell 3000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_3000_Index) (also top 3 with a 3 month rebalance) also improves performance.

Adding the drug retail (GICS 30101010) and food retail (GICS 30101030) is another iteration to consider. (BeSToGaRR; extra R for Retail).

Street Capital Financial to Continue and Operate as Street Capital Bank of Canada

TORONTO, Dec. 13, 2016 /CNW/ - Street Capital Group Inc. (""Street Capital"" or the ""Company"") (TSX: SCB), today announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Street Capital Financial Corporation (""Street Capital Financial""), has received Letters Patent from the Federal Minister of Finance and an Order to Commence and Carry on Business from the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, Canada, permitting Street Capital Financial to continue and operate as a Canadian Schedule I bank. Effective February 1, 2017, Street Capital Financial will continue as Street Capital Bank of Canada (""Street Capital Bank"") and will commence its operations as a federally regulated financial institution.

Approximately four years ago, Street Capital Financial conducted a strategic review of its business as well as the Canadian mortgage regulatory environment and concluded that there was an opportunity to ensure its continued growth by becoming a bank.  Street Capital Bank will have the ability to access additional sources of liquidity, strategically positioning it to better support its current mortgage business, its planned expansion in this segment and future retail banking opportunities.

Remember when Fidelity Magellan fund had to close for a while?  It just got too big, had too much cash, couldn't buy or sell anything significant without affecting the markets it was in.  Its huge amount of cash became a liability.

**Does that ever happen** with the gazillions of dollars that US companies have, ""stashed"" overseas in foreign accounts that they can't bring back without great cost?  In the same way that a mutual fund can get too big, does that much cash become a ""problem"" for the company?  They can't pay dividends with it; they can't do buybacks; they probably couldn't even acquire a US-based company.  There it sits, in the Bank of Ireland or wherever.

In the same way that my dubious Picasso became a liability, does all that offshore money become a liability somehow -- or if not, at least ""useless"" to them?

16-12-14,5i8rma,$TSLA entering major bullish phase,"Hey guys,

A few weeks ago I said that I was bearish on $TSLA. This was because I expect the Model 3 to not achieve a price of $30,000 unless Tesla wants to go bankrupt.

However, looking at the technical chart analysis, $TSLA seems to be entering a bullish phase and I predict it to go to $280 within 6-12 months. 

This is because there may be a powers beyond our control that are pushing for driverless vehicles, and the fact that Google just announced that they are no longer making their own self-driving vehicles. I expect GM to fall behind Tesla once the Model 3 is on sale, and more affordable Tesla models should be announced by late 2017. 

Disclaimer: these are my predictions based on both technical analysis and market trends. Tesla's balance sheet is still terrible, however $AMZN made it to $800 with an even worse balance sheet.",4

16-12-14,5ide0d,Fed funds rate to .5% from .25%,"An interesting article from my Scottrade account that may help new traders.

With the Fed raising its key Fed funds rate to .5% from .25%, you might be wondering what it means for you.

For starters, the market was anticipating such a rate hike. So the fact that the increase was in line with expectations, could mean a relatively muted impact on stocks, according to Joe Correnti, senior vice president of brokerage product at Scottrade.

“The market tends to make significant short-term moves when there are surprises,” Correnti said. “And this wasn’t a surprise. But the longer-term impacts remain unknown. So there could be volatility tied to that.”

Let’s review first, what the Fed did.
Fed Funds Rate

The Fed actually controls only one set of short-term interest rates, called the Fed funds rate. That’s the interest rate that banks or similar institutions charge other banks for unsecured short-term loans (typically overnight) to help meet Federal Reserve requirements.

This increase was only the second in 8 years; the last was a year ago when the Fed hiked it from 0 to .25%. While the market has been used to a near-zero Fed funds rate, the last 8 years have been an outlier. Until 2008, rates had never been below 1%.

Generally, longer-term rates – anything beyond a couple of years – effectively are set in the borrowing marketplace. Everything from the rate that companies pay to fund long-term capital expenditures to short-term payday loans are set by competitors. An increase in the Fed funds rate could have little to no impact on those rates.

For example, following the December 2015 Fed funds increase, 30-year mortgage rates actually fell throughout most of the year. 

In the meantime, you should also pay attention to what the Fed said as it increased the rate. Given that the stock and bond markets were expecting it, they will also try to anticipate what the Fed will do in 2017.
Impact on Your Investment Portfolio

Of course, there could be differences this time around. If the Fed continues raising interest rates, then perhaps there could be a more significant impact on longer-term rates. The bottom line is that economists and Wall Street experts who are trained in understanding the movement of interest rates have a difficult time projecting where rates are going.

This level of uncertainty illustrates the importance of developing and sticking to a diversified investment plan.

“Trying to predict what the Fed might do, and how the markets will react, can be challenging,” Correnti said. “For long-term investors, it makes sense to have an understanding of interest rates, but it might not make sense to make a lot of changes to a well-diversified portfolio based on where you think rates are headed.”
Impact on the Economy

When the Fed lowers interest rates, the primary objective is to stimulate the economy, in part by making it easier and less expensive to borrow. For example, home buying tends to increase as interest rates move lower. Conversely, the Fed will raise interest rates – as it has in this case – in the hopes of heading off inflation, which can result from an overstimulated economy.

But, as noted above, longer-term interest rates might not move much based on the Fed funds rate.
Impact on Securities

    Fixed-income. The price of a bond typically rises when interest rates fall. When interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall. So if the Fed is moving through a period of raising short-term rates, bond prices could fall. However, if you hold individual bonds to maturity, you typically will get all of your principal back.
    Equities. The impact of interest rate movements are less obvious or consistent when it comes to stocks. For example, although the stock markets – at least initially – tend to react negatively to rising interest rates, some sectors actually perform better with rising interest rates.

Impact on Savings and Borrowing

    At the most basic level, the Fed’s short-term interest rates serve as a barometer for rates that you might get through a bank checking or savings account or a money market account. A higher Fed funds rate, the higher the rate you’re likely to receive.
    For borrowers, higher rates can lead to higher borrowing costs. For example, if you have an adjustable rate for a credit card or mortgage tied to the prime rate, your rate could increase with the increase in Fed rates.

16-12-14,5idv6j,ESPP - Should I participate?,"So far I have been buying every quarter and just sold all the shares I could for a 21% *TOTAL* profit (buying quarterly since 12/2013). ****I did not buy ALL of the stock in 12/2013****. On just the stock I bought in 12/2013 I have made about 44% profit.

Here are the rules:

1. Have to hold the stock for 15 months before selling
2. Purchase Price = ((price at beginning of quarter + price at end of quarter) / 2)*.95. This means that I could purchase the stock for more than FMV. Looking backward this has only happened in two quarters in the last 10 years or so.
3. &lt; 0.8 Dividend Yield.

I was contemplating buying as much stock as the company allowed per quarter and always selling the stock after I held it for 15 months. If the stock market started to go down significantly, I would just stop selling until I could sell the shares at a profit. If I kept selling, this position would make up about 5% of my total investment portfolio at any given time. Analysts currently have it rated as a buy, and I would at least rate it a hold.

On a side note, I see the current stock market as being in a bubble/overpriced, but don't see anything other than significant rate hikes or something big happening in the financial world that would cause it to fall.

16-12-15,5ihao9,"Reasons for investing in Tesla Motors ($TSLA). My analysis. Please discuss, this may be a turning point for this stock.","In my opinion, $TSLA is about to head for $350. Here are the reasons why:

- $TSLA is only getting started with rolling out its first affordable car for the masses, the Model 3. There are at least hundreds of thousands of pre-orders, and the potential for more as oil prices increase. 

- Looking at $TSLA's technical chart, $TSLA is going to break out of the $200 resistance level very soon. There has been too much sideways movement for this stock over the past couple of months and indecision between bulls and bears seem to indicate that a breakout is about to happen. My prediction is that it is going to the upside. 

- Donald Trump, who is seen to be anti-Silicon Valley, has increasingly indicated that he may support Tesla into the future. Firstly, Donald Trump just appointed Elon Musk as one of his business advisers.  Secondly, Tesla manufactures all of its cars in the US and is planning to expand production facilities and Gigafactories across the US in the future. Eventually Tesla will need to expand abroad, however it seems like Elon Musk is very pro-US in regards to keeping money on-shore. Another reason why Trump may have a positive view of Tesla is that the company has added tens of thousands of jobs in the US in the past year, more than any other American company. 

- The general trend in technology is to look for more efficient ways to create and spend energy and solar power along with highly efficient vehicles is a large part of that solution. 

- It is incredibly hard to benefit from shorting $TSLA stock as it requires $TSLA to plummet by A LOT to make a sizable profit. 

- Tesla is not just an auto company, it is also an energy company and has the potential to expand into other industries. This may lead the company to a size that will be similar to Samsung and Toyota, the massive conglomerates of Korea and Japan. Tesla is diversifying itself, and this should be positive to its stock. 

- The US economy and wage growth are improving. Along with rising oil prices, this appears to be a perfect storm that will cause a surge in $TSLA stock. 

Overall, I think $TSLA will grow to be much larger than it is right now.

Other than the outstanding debt the company has a strong Financial showing. They also have a competitive advantages in the fact that they own the majority of its own factories, and have long lasting relationships with its largest customer Walmart and Target.

16-12-14,5ic642,A good article describing the present situation in the uranium sector,"Last week the spot price of uranium closed at USD $18/lb. If you are a contrarian resource investor, there is no better place to be than in the uranium sector right now. Market participants have not seen prices this low since September 2004. Just like today, the outlook was bleak in late 2004 when prices were sub-USD $20/lb but investors who were buying reaped mega profits as prices soared to USD $137/lb by mid-2007.

According to Bloomberg, Cameco Corporation (TSX:CCO) short interest is at an all time high while shares have diverged and are up nearly 35% from their 52-week low, certainly something worth paying attention too.

Another uranium company investors are closely following right now is NexGen Energy (TSX:NXE) which has 100% ownership of the Arrow deposit, the Athabasca Basin’s largest high grade exploration and development stage project. Arrow hosts an Inferred mineral resource estimate of 3.48Mt containing 201.9Mlbs U308 grading 2.63% U308 which was based on approximately 60,000 m of drilling up until the end of 2015.  Since then, NexGen has drilled an additional approximate 73,000 m and it remains open in all directions and at depth.

I was fortunate to sit down with Leigh Curyer, Chief Executive Officer of Nexgen Energy to talk about the macro uranium market and provide an update for shareholders.

AN: As of late, there has been a focus on above ground inventory which has been blamed for the continuous decreasing spot price. What is your interpretation of how the supply and demand fundamentals will drive the price of uranium in the next 2-3 years?

LC: There is a little known fact that the above ground inventory levels are currently lower than what they were in 2007 when the price of uranium was over USD $135/lb. Additionally, a significant portion of the present day above ground inventory is held in China for domestic nuclear reactor use and is not expected to ever leave that continent. So to suggest that the market is oversupplied at present with uranium due to the price you just have to look back to 2007 when above ground inventory levels were higher when the price was substantially higher.

Secondly, we currently have a situation where Kazakhstan, a major uranium producing country, quadrupled production from 2011 to 2016. As Kazakhstan has maintained that level of production, trying to produce a pound of uranium at the given cost structure has now become exponentially more difficult as they deplete higher grade reserves.  Additionally, they have recently come out publicly and stated they want to ‘manage inventories’.  What this means is they are happy with their market share and now want to optimize their margins which is likely to mean less pounds on the market at low prices.

Thirdly, right now the spot price is under USD$20/lb, but very thinly traded. Over 90% of trades within the year are contract-based which is outside of the spot price market. Very marginal volumes will trade at less than USD $20/lb on the spot market. As a result, you see utilities that recently signed a USD $43/lb contract for a project in Spain. This illustrates the fact that the utilities don’t have confidence in their ability to procure an endless supply of uranium at less than USD $20/lb. Also, I doubt there is a uranium mine on the globe that could generate a profit at USD $20/lb uranium.

Considering all of the above I believe the downward trend in prices will bust. As to when this will be, this is tough to judge, but I believe you will see a tightening of supply over the course of 2017 which when paired with no real identifiable primary production coming online within the next 5 years, will create rising prices sooner rather than later....

If you have capital losses totaling $1k to report for the year and you've already paid let's say $10k in income taxes and you don't owe anymore to the IRS, would you get a refund check of $1k? Or is that $10k you paid in income tax and $1k you lost gone?

Passive investors aren't regularly realizing capital gains, so they only use loss-harvests to offset 3k of income taxes. Given a large capital base, one can probably make 3k of loss harvests even without direct-indexing, so the benefit of direct-indexing is probably negligible for passive investors with large capital. However, direct-indexing seems to be intended precisely for passive investors with large capital, so we see a contradiction here.  Why would anybody ever direct-index?

Would it be for people who have large passive portions of their portfolio, but also happen to have some active trading strategies, which regularly realized short term capital gains?",0

NGPHF's share price (a graphite mining company) has increased by 81 percent in the last 8 days. PEMIF has increased by 30 percent in the last 2 weeks and I expect ECSIF to see similar increases. I am very confident these upward trends will continue.

Bill Gates just announced a $1 billion fund to invest in technologies aimed at counteracting climate change. Junior mining companies like PEMIF, ECSIF and NGPHF are a great, cheap way to get behind this movement, and will all surely benefit from these advancements in green technology.

Interest rates that are falling(2 rate drops last year) and a housing market that is significantly overvalued by any metric mean banks have a lot of headwinds. Debt levels in Canada are also higher than in the US in 2007 and the Canadian banks are severely under capitalized because of the CMHC. Arguably, the CMHC will save the bank from collapse, but they can't help earnings when they eventually plummet.

The bank of Canada has a very difficult decision moving forward, because they're dealing with a falling $CAD while housing is getting ready to collapse. Either they raise rates to protect the dollar and kill the housing market, or they lower rates to protect housing and kill the dollar.Thoughts?

How might you profit from this bet? Consider the following hypothetical scenario:
You have a 50% income tax rate, 25% STCG, and no realized gains this year, and don't plan to.

If you buy 3000 coin-flip contracts, then what is the after tax result?
Heads: Win $3000 -&gt; $2250 after STCG
Tails: Lose $3000 -&gt; Offset $1500 of income tax -&gt; -$1500 after tax.

Thus you make about $375 on average.

Am I correct in my line of thinking? My guess is not.

P.S. You can probably find coin-flip like bets in the options market, in the form of something like an at-the-money call spread.

16-12-15,5iiub2,"Relevant: ""Why does a pending acquired company's stock trade for less than it will eventually be bought for?"" Answer: VZ and YHOO.","I see this question asked all the time. A company is announced to be acquired for $50 a share for example, and it jumps up to trade at $48 a share. People always ask - why not buy up as many shares as possible and make $2 a share when the deal closes?

Two reasons: 

One, you could theoretically purchase enough stock to change the price of the available shares to purchase. (e.g., maybe a million shares are available at $48, but eventually you're going to move the price up to $49 as you acquire all the available $48 shares.

Two, and more likely for non-institutional investors: because deals fall through or change, as the Verizon acquisition of Yahoo is currently showing.

Relevant:

16-12-15,5ijcps,"Help!! My mutual fund just fell by a large amount and I'm not sure why?? Find out inside.","**Every year in December we start to get 5-10 posts a day asking this question.  Rather than have a ton of clutter in the sub I'm going to be stickying this post until the end of the month.**


A mutual fund is essentially just a basket of individual stocks/bonds/whatever.  Within that basket the fund managers are constantly selling/buying and receiving dividends.  The IRS has special rules for mutual funds which allow them to not pay taxes on the capital gains/dividends generated provided they pass through almost all of the proceeds from said activities to the shareholder within the calendar year.  So dividends are often paid on some set schedule but capital gains are generally retained within the fund till the end of the year(because losses can reduce gains but can't be distributed to a shareholder). 

So on to why your fund dropped: in mid December everyone starts distributing these gains and as we know when a fund makes a distribution its NAV drops by an equal amount.  For example a fund that was trading at $10 and had It's value made up of $9 worth of stock and $1 worth of cash to be distributed now no longer has that $1.  So it'll drop by 10% because of that fact.  Don't worry, you didn't lose any money because the $1 was paid to you in cash(and in most cases reinvested in the form of buying more shares).

There isn't any value created or lost in a distribution(except to taxes) it's just a necessary taxable transaction that must occur because of how mutual funds are structured.  Etfs are technically subject to this as well but since most follow passive cap weighted strategies they don't usually have capital gains realized to distribute.

**Please note we'll probably be deleting any threads on the subject to keep the clutter down.**

Also please feel free to add whatever questions/comments you have to this sticky.

When I look at bond funds/etfs over history, they wave... sometimes sideways, sometimes modestly up, depending of the level of interest and bond class, but nearly always as a wave, repeatedly fluctuating through a trend line that is fairly easy to infer. The waves are more dramatic for longer term bonds, but who cares? If you're long term, seriously, who cares? Just wait 'til the price rebounds. If you were investing for capital gains, you'd be in stocks anyway, not fixed income, right?

If the current price is below the inferrable line, is it a good time to buy?

Let's say Bob's Tire and Brakes is tired (ugh...  sorry) of brakes, and has thought about selling off it's brake department because the recent brake industry has been pretty volatile, and is affecting his tire business.  

A news article is printed stating that they have word that Bob is selling off his brake department, and that Dave's Automotive is in a great position to buy it.  

Oscar's investment company decreases it's stake in Bob's Tire and Brakes, and raises it's position in Dave's Automotive, yet neither company has made an official announcement on the divestiture.

My question is more along the lines of what Oscar's Investments is banking on.

Is Oscar hoping that Dave's Automotive is actually going to buy Bob's brake piece of the company?  
Or is Oscar just hoping that the media attention alone sparked by the article is going to cast some negative light on Bob's Brakes and Tire for looking like it's in financial trouble, and that Dave's Automotive looks stable enough to buy it, hence making it look like a more stable/profitable buy, regardless if the purchase occurs or not.

Now if I apply for a margin account for my cash account through Vanguard, what will be the outcome?

1) In the above scenario, when I buy Amazon shares, should I choose between Cash account or Margin account? Or will the margin account only kicks in if I don't have enough money in my cash account?

I saw Nintendo drop more than 3% today (12-15-16) with a 8.5% drop this week and was curious if this is a move by insiders drop it and buy back in before it potentially blows up for Nintendo's newest phone game. The difference between PoGo and S.M.Run is that S.M.Run is owned by Nintendo. The downside is that the game is pretty limited unless it is bought for a premium price. I don't make purchases for apps on my phone, so I don't know the mentality that well, but do you think that people will pay the up front cost or 9.99 USD to send Nintendo stock soaring again? I feel since Apple users already pay a premium for their phones they will spend the money if they want S.M.Run no problems, where the Android market is really going to be up in the air and might miss on revenue until that price drops.

16-12-16,5in5vc,I think i just screwed myself in mass mutual 403b,"I transfered $4200 in my massmutual 403b from MEFAX mid cap mutual fund to a cash capital preservation fund.

To my horror i saw the fund was down on 12/15/16 by 4.5% even though the mid cap index was up 0.75%

I realized i did the transfer on the ex dividend date which was yesterday on 12/15.

Normally when this happens on my mutual funds  with mass mutual 403b my balance takes a big loss on that day but a few days later they make me whole again by putting the money back in my account.

For example i also hold a small cap value fund called CRISX and it had a dividend date on 12/8
My balance took a $500 loss for crisx on 12/8 but on 12/9 i had $610 gain added to crisx. (Made whole by dividend payment)

I am really freaking out because i fear that tommorow i will not get that mass mutual adjustment since i no longer hold any shares of MEFAX since that account is now in capital preservation.

I am really mad at myself i made this transfer on the absolute worst day possible and could have just locked in a 5%'loss on a fund due to a capital gains distribution.

I sent mass mutual an email about this but i am sure i will get some guy who has no clue what im talking about since i hardly understand it and i live, eat, sleep and breath investing.

Massmutual also does not report dividend returns seperatly from overall returns on the statements so i am really afraid i just screwed myself.

Any advice or suggestions on how to argue this if my worst fears are realized?",0

16-12-16,5inc0m,What do you guys think about these 40 funds I can pick from? (Keyplan),"Hi guys,

I'm a guy from Belgium, rather new to investing (apart from some state bonds, TAK23 (stocks dressed up in the form of a life insurance, to prevent taxes)) stuff, and the typical retirement saving, and pre-investing of some home costs which we get tax refunds for (about 40% each!).

Because I want to put savings into long-term investing, I have been researching ETF's quite a bit. I also ran into Keytrade's Keyplan which allows me to gradually put money into it, without any monthly costs  (the only costs are when pulling back the money within 5 years, which would cost me €10 per funds). They expect you to put in an amount every month/three months/half year/year, of at least €25 a year, but you can just put any spare money into it as well, which makes it extra interesting to me. There is however only 40 possible funds I can pick from. I'm not entirely sure which ones are the most interesting for the time being (of course no-one has a crystal ball to gaze into, though :-))

So, what do you guys think are the more interesting funds? They can be found [at the bottom of this page](https://www.keytradebank.be/en/investing/keyplan/)",1

The acceleration in user growth is evident from the fact that the platform added 100M users in the last 6 months, compared to the 9 months it took for the previous 100M. In a post on thestreet.com, Ben Kenwell summed it up pretty well in just one line: While Instagram saw its user count swell to 600 million, the growth is even more impressive.

What signal should i look for to buy more, even when i am way above my average cost? Even in the long term outlook? When it is closer to my average cost? What if it never gets closer?? Should i Increase the average just to enable gains? 

Thank you!",2

If the investor is bullish, then why would he be selling strike calls? Is it a bull call spread? 

""To take advantage of an Alphabet rally, Gordon buys the December 820-strike calls and sells the December 825-strike calls for $1.25 per share, or $125 per options contract. Gordon is betting that Alphabet will close above $825 on Dec. 16, which would net him $500, for a profit of $375. In other words, Gordon could quadruple his money if Alphabet rises about 4 percent in the coming weeks.""

#Trading Update
•	Market update – Eurozone equities and US futures were both flattish for most of the early morning but staged a rally around 5:30amET (there wasn’t any headline that crossed the wire at that time).  There isn’t too much incremental news to talk about Fri morning as markets globally begin to quietly shut down for 2016 (there are only two major macro events left – Yellen’s speech Mon 12/19 at 1:30pmET and the BOJ decision Tues morning 12/20).  The big risk for US equities remains elevated political expectations – this isn’t a subject many want to talk about at the moment but the growing opposition to the GOP border adjustment proposal could threaten to undermine the entire corporate tax reform effort (this has been showing up in the press lately, including in the FT Wed morning and on Reuters Friday morning).  It won’t be until later in Jan (at the earliest) when various committees in Congress will start drafting legislation but investors are starting to pay a bit more attention to this risk.  Other than the outlook for US taxes, there weren’t many big headlines in the last 12-18 hours (from the perspective of domestic equities).  
•	Calendar - for Friday investors will be watching the US housing starts/building permits for Nov (at 8:30amET), comments from Fed’s Lacker (12:30pmET), and a bunch of analyst meetings (AGCO, CNC, HON, and MET).  Also Obama will hold his final press conf. of the year.  
•	Eurozone equities – the major indices opened in the red but staged a rally beginning around 5:30amET and are now higher (up ~30-80bp).  Autos, tech, insurance, telecoms, and energy are all leading on the upside while banks, media, and retail lag.  Europe-specific news was pretty slow (esp. on the macro front).    
•	Treasuries – TSYs have a mild bid after the recent sell-off (2 and 10yr yields are down 1.7 and 4bp, respectively).  
•	FX – the DXY is off small so far Fri (by ~20bp) after surging Wed and Thurs.  The USD is in the red against most major crosses (the EUR is outperforming w/a 40bpbp rally).  The CNY fell further against the USD (by another 16bp).  
•	Asia – stocks saw mixed price action in Asia: Japan (TPX +0.52%, NKY +0.66%), HK (Hang Seng -0.18%, HSCEI -0.09%), mainland China (SHCOMP +0.17%, Shenzhen +0.95%,CSI 300 +0.17%), Taiwan (TAIEX -0.36%), Korea (KOSPI +0.27%), Australia  (ASX 200 -0.1%), and India (down 11-17bp).  There weren’t too many major Asia-specific headlines.  A few headlines crossed out of the China Central Economic Work Conference although none were particularly notable (a lot of the usual platitudes about holding growth in a “reasonable” range, etc.).  
•	China/HK – mainland Chinese stocks rebounded on Fri (SHCOMP +0.17%, Shenzhen +0.95%) but still suffered losses for the week (SHCOMP -3.4%).  Nothing major occurred Fri although some of the headlines from the China Central Economic Work Conference helped to sooth sentiment.  Also a larger PBOC liquidity injection helped cool the recent domestic yield spike.  The main HK indices extended their losses (Hang Seng -0.18%, HSCEI -0.09%).  Within the Hang Seng laggard groups included REITs, telecoms, utilities, and staples (a lot of the “bond proxy” groups).  Energy stocks continued to have a bid (CNOOC +0.6%) while tech did well too (Lenovo +0.42%, AAC Tech +0.44%).  AIA Group and Galaxy both climbed &gt;1%.  Property names were hit and China Mengniu Dairy sank after neg. earnings.  China Unicom saw profit taking.  
•	Japan – the main Japanese indices extended their gains (helped by the JPY slump on Fri although the currency is flat-to-up Fri morning).  Sector moves were interestingly mixed within financial space with Banks +1.7% outperforming while Insurers -1.3% lagged. Banks were broadly strong on JGB yield surge after BoJ's Rinban gave a negative impression to bonds market as they reduced the amount of JGB purchases from last time. Within Insurers, Daiichi Life +1.6% gained, while MS&amp;AD -2.7% got hit as JPM's Tsujino rpts her preference for lifers over P&amp;Cs. Otherwise, commodities including Metal +2.3%, Iron +0.7%, Oil +0.8% picked up from the reversion play as coal, crude price bounced.  Nintendo -4.2%, DeNA -6.8% slumped after releasing 'Super Mario Run'. Taiyo Yuden +3.3% rose after outside broker upgraded to Neutral. Park24 -0.7% slipped as FY OP ending Oct Y21.5bn missed Nikkei preview ¥24bn.  JPM's Sakagami rpts his bullish stance for overall market with his target of NKY/TPX for 2017 at ¥21k, 1,650pts respectively.
 
#Top Headlines for Friday 
•	US taxes – border adjustment proposal faces growing opposition according to Reuters (http://reut.rs/2hB62br) – the initial post-11/8 market enthusiasm was underpinned by a cursory focus on the proposed cuts to statutory corporate tax rates.  However, investors in the last few weeks have spent more time focusing on the intricacies of the Trump/Ryan proposal and opposition to certain details, in particular the border adjustment idea, is growing.  This was the subject of a pg. 1 FT article Wed morning (“Republicans face corporate tax rebellion”) and is talked about in a Reuters article Fri morning (“U.S. tax reform proposal on border trade faces growing opposition”).  Border adjustments are a key piece of the GOP corporate tax reform agenda and rates may not be able to move materially lower w/o it (w/o border adjustments some think the whole House tax plan would “collapse”).  JPMorgan’s M Feroli wrote about border adjustments in this note (http://bit.ly/2gvBmHF) and JPM’s retail analyst Matt Boss discussed the impact of corporate tax reform on his sector in a note Fri morning (http://bit.ly/2gRoCw1).  
•	Obama warned that the US will retaliate against Russia for hacking the US election.  “I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections ... we need to take action” – Washington Post   http://wapo.st/2hCa6Wa   
•	Larry Kudlow has emerged as a leading candidate to become head of Trump’s White House Council of Economic Advisors – WSJ     http://on.wsj.com/2gQ7ANt   
•	Trump rally - the Dow’s 8% gain in the five weeks after Donald Trump’s victory is the biggest surge following any U.S. presidential election in history; history suggests the gains could continue – WSJ   http://on.wsj.com/2gR5TRy   
•	Company-specific news update from Thurs night 12/15.  ADBE’s earnings overall were solid; the key metric is Digital Media ARR (Annualized Recurring Revs) coming in at $4.01B (vs. the St $3.97B).  The ADBE F17 income statement guide is a touch under the St but in general the result was solid.  JBL’s results were nicely ahead of the St (w/the AAPL-focused DM revs beating guidance) and the outlook was bright too (JBL saw a big after-hours rally).  ORCL continues to face the same dichotomy as before – the new cloud businesses are doing very well (non-GAAP SaaS/PaaS revs came in up ~89% CC which is nicely ahead of the 80% growth guidance) while the legacy ones suffer (legacy new SW licenses came in $1.347B vs. the St $1.44B).  PCLN announced that Glenn Fogel, the company's current Head of Strategy and Executive Vice President of Corporate Development, has been named CEO of the company and SABR has appointed Sean Menke as president, CEO and a member of Sabre's board.  Away from tech, CNC provided 2017 guidance and the EPS range 4.40-4.85 was light of the St (St is at 4.83); CNC cites increased healthcare uncertainty following the election for the subdued guide (CNC says if its Marketplace business performs inline w/’16 levels next year then EPS would be at the upper-end of guidance which is inline w/the St).  A judge has ruled that GILD must pay MRK $2.54B in hep-C royalties (per Bloomberg; GILD said it disagrees w/the decision and will appeal).  MET and TERP also had ’17 guidance metrics on the tape after the close.  DOW said it will exercise its option to convert all of the Series A preferred stock into shares of common stock (the conversion of all four million shares of Series A preferred stock, will result in an additional 96.804 million shares of outstanding Dow common stock).  GNC announced that all corporate stores will close on December 28 and reopen on December 29, when GNC will be providing customers a dramatically improved experience with the launch of One New GNC (#ONEnewGNC).

#Macro Update
•	The same factors as before continue to exert upside influence on equity prices -Dec seasonality, a penchant to “chase” from people left behind by the post-11/8 rally, news/liquidity vacuums, Trump/Ryan fiscal/regulatory anticipation (this obviously remains the key driver of stocks), and solid nominal economic growth.  After the flash PMIs Thurs morning there really are no additional macro events left on the 2016 calendar (other than Yellen’s speech Mon 12/19 at 1:30pmET and the BOJ Tues morning 12/20) and thus the current optimism can continue propagating for another two weeks at least.  Sentiment remains upbeat on the prospects for stocks over the next two weeks into year-end (or until the inauguration on 1/20) although there certainly is evidence of rising skepticism behind the scenes and this may become more apparent once the year-end non-fundamental effects fade.  Elevated political expectations remain (by far) the biggest risk to the market and while it won’t be until early Feb when the various Congressional committees start producing rough tax reform drafts, investors are beginning to pay a bit more attention to some of the particulars of the Ryan/Trump agenda (specifically, the whole border adjustment issue, which was discussed in the Wed morning FT article “Republicans face corporate tax rebellion” and which JPMorgan wrote about here http://bit.ly/2gvBmHF, was one of the factors that weighed hard on apparel-linked names such as PVH, RL, COH, KORS, UA, URBN, JWN, TIF, etc., during Thurs trading).  The SPX is on pace to earn ~$116-117 for this year and the St pre-Trump was modeling ~$127 for ’17.  On ~$127 the current PE is elevated at ~17.8x but not ridiculous (although the ERP has compressed a lot more than the PE has risen of late given the move in TSYs – in Aug the ERP was ~420bp but that has since declined to ~300bp).  If the full Trump/Ryan agenda is implemented, it could eventually be worth ~$20 to EPS over the course of multiple years (as written about in this JPMorgan note http://bit.ly/2hmIsz9).
 
#Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon Dec 19
•	The week of 12/19 will suffer from reduced attendance and liquidity but there are actually a bunch of earnings reports to keep an eye on, including: LEN (Mon morning 12/19), BBRY, CCL, DRI, FDS, GIS, KMX, NAV, VAL (Tues morning 12/20), FDX, NKE (Tues night 12/20), ACN, ATU, FINL, LNN, PAYX, WGO (Wed morning 12/21), BBBY, MU, RHT (Wed night 12/21), CAG (Thurs morning 12/22), and CALM (Thurs night 12/22).  In addition to the busy earnings schedule a lot of eco numbers are on the calendar, the most important of which will be US Nov PCE (Thurs 12/22 at 10amET), while Yellen is due to speak on the state of the jobs market Mon 12/19 (at 1:30pmET).  Finally, the BOJ decision (Tues morning 12/20) should be a non-event.
 
#Catalysts for 2017 – big events to watch for 2017 (preliminary list – additional events likely to be added)
•	CES – the Consumer Electronics Show formally runs from Jan 5-8 in Las Vegas but “media days” take place Jan 3-4.  
•	US Dec jobs report Fri 1/6.
•	JPMorgan Healthcare Conf.  Jan 9-13.  San Francisco.  Healthcare is one of the most hated sectors right now and this is one of the industry’s biggest events.
•	US bank earnings season kicks off Fri 1/13 (BAC, JPM, PNC, and WFC all report that day).
•	Earnings - week of Mon 1/16 is the first big one of the CQ4 earnings season.
•	World Economic Forum 1/17-20 in Davos.
•	ECB – first ECB decision of the year will occur on Jan 19.
•	Trump inauguration Fri 1/20.
•	Trump priorities – Trump will have a finite stock of political capital but a broad agenda, including tax reform (individual and corporate), infrastructure spending, deregulation (ACA, Dodd-Frank, fiduciary rule, etc.), immigration reform, trade deal adjustments, Supreme Court nominees (at least one).  What parts of the platform are prioritized and which get deemphasized?  
•	Trump fiscal specifics - what are the particulars of the tax reform bills – rates, deductions, etc.?  How will the fiscal priorities be sequenced?  Will corporate and individual tax reform get tackled separately, in which case the latter may not happen until the end of ’17 or early ’18?  Will Republicans utilize “reconciliation” to pass tax reform (which could limit the scope of fiscal stimulus given the need for any legislation passed in this manner to be deficit-neutral) or seek the support of some Democrats (which could dilute GOP priorities)?  Can Republicans secure relative unanimity in the Senate to even utilize reconciliation (the GOP will have 52 seats in 2017 but at least 8 of them could raise objections to some parts of the Trump fiscal agenda)?
•	Fed appointment decisions – Trump has two appointments to immediately make to the Federal Reserve Board.  Also, Yellen’s term as Chair ends 2/3/18 and she will likely serve until that date although speculation of her replacement should kick into high gear around the spring/summer of ’17.  
•	Foreign policy - does Trump unequivocally express support for important and historic US military alliances such as NATO?  What actions are taken in retaliation for cyberattacks waged against the US over the last several months?  Where does Trump go on his first foreign trips (these are usually seen as a signal of foreign policy priorities for any incoming president)?  Trump will quickly need to formulate specific policies w/regards to China and the South China Sea, North Korea’s nuclear program, and Russia’s behavior on its western border.  Does the recent antagonism towards China over the “One China” policy persist?  According to media reports, Obama has communicated to Trump how the NK nuclear program is the single largest foreign policy challenge facing the US.  Also it will be interesting to hear Trump’s view on sustaining the sanctions against Russia (for the unlawful seizure of Crimea) and retaining the Iran nuclear deal.  
•	Japan – there is speculation Abe could call elections in the Jan timeframe.
•	US banks – the Fed will prob. publish the ’17 CCAR/stress test criteria around the end of Jan (the criteria was released Jan 28, 2016 for the last testing cycle).  
•	Italy – Italian Constitutional Court to hold hearing on legitimacy of Italian electoral law on Jan 24.
•	Fed – first Fed decision of the year will occur on Feb 1.
•	Netherlands will have national elections Mar 15.
•	Fed meeting – first press conf./dot plot decision of the year is Mar 15.  
•	G20 Fin Min/central bank governors meeting Mar 17-18 in Germany.  
•	China’s National People’s Congress (NPC) usually takes place in mid-Mar; the gov’t will formally publish its 2017 economic objectives at this event.
•	US debt ceiling - the debt limit has been suspended since late ’15 but is due to be reinstated on Mar 16, 2017.
•	EU Leaders Summit in late Mar – this could be the forum at which the UK formally triggers Article 50 (UK PM May has said she wants to trigger Article 50 before Mar).
•	Deutsche Bank US RMBS settlement (investors assume the final settlement will happen by the end of Q1 for an amount in the ~$4-5B range).
•	WFC’s “living will” – WFC will resubmit its living will in the Mar timeframe.  Normally this wouldn’t be a major event but if WFC’s living will is deemed inadequate again the Fed could raise the company’s capital requirements.  
•	France first-round presidential election Apr 23 (run-off is May 7).
•	US Treasury publishes semi-annual currency report around Apr timeframe (investors will watch China designation closely).
•	US gov’t funding – current spending legislation will keep the gov’t funding until Apr 28
•	G7 Leaders Summit May 26-27 in Italy.  
•	Italy – new elections are likely in the June timeframe.  
•	China/MSCI - MSCI will announce the result of the China A shares inclusion proposal as part of the 2017 Market Classification Review in June 2017.  
•	G20 Leaders Summit Jul 7-8 2017 in Germany.  
•	German elections – the next German elections will be held between Aug and Oct 2017.

currently, cgc is trading at 10.29 so .7132% is 7.33$ a share of mettrum, while mettrum is currently trading at 6.73. so that's a profit for now.

16-12-16,5iotpp,A small analysis on CARA (actual DD),"So, unlike 99.9% of the posts on here, I'm going to attempt an actual DD. 

CARA is currently recruiting for 11 different trials. I believe the conditions they are treating that are most important (profitable) are depression, leukemia, hypertension, lymphoma, and arthritis. You can see all their trials [here](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=CARA+Therapeutics&amp;Search=Search). 

**Timeline:**

* February 2017 - **Leukemia** Phase 1 
* April 2017 - Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome Phase 4
* May 2017 - Arthritis Phase 2
* May 2017 - Pain after abdominal surgery Phase 2-3
* June 2017 - Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)
* September 2017 - Urinary Incontinence Falls, Accidental Quality of Life Stigma
* August 2018 - Hypertension Phase 3
* October 2018 - Lymphoma Phase 1-2

The leukemia one could send this stock soaring. I know there have been a lot of posts about CARA in the past, but I think there is definitely a play here. There are more trials on the website linked above, you can look at them for yourself.

I did a defense portfolio if you can call it that with lockheed martin, northrop grumman, boeing and raytheon. I like the first 3 companies based on their products I am aware of, raytheon I am not so sure off but I've heard that they have potential to climb into the 200$ stock like the others so I tried it out.

Anyways looking at these 4 stocks only one has given me positive return and that is Boeing. Now one month is a short time and I've been reading some news about trump talking bad about the president plane (boeing) and the f35 (lockheed). 

So my question is this: should you continue to invest in those stocks that give you positive return and just let the others be. Or should you sell the stocks that give oyu a negative return?

Is it foolish to put both my retirement and short term (10 year) cash into the same index? I know diversity is important but they don't seem all that different to me in terms of performance or cost.

Gold and volatility go hand in hand. An extremely unpredictable event that causes you to either lose a lot or make a lot of money. You cant have a weak stomach with these ETFs. Be ready to take a loss at times for things that are out of your control.

16-12-17,5iv8dy,Questions from an absolute beginner,"Hello Everyone and thank you for taking the time to read this post.
  
To keep things simple and concise: I wanna buy some stock now and then sell it a later. Easier said than done. My issues:
  
1). is there a platform that doesn't charge you 5-10 $ per trade and/ or a monthly fee or other costs?
  
2). is there a platform where I can trade irrespective of my location (I'm European and wanna be able to trade stocks from all around the world)?
  
3). is there a platform that doesn't shove brokers down your mouth? (I really don't want one and prefer to do everything myself)
  
4). is there a platform that isn't a zoo of specialized terms and acronyms?
  
  
It would be great if all 4 could be fulfilled by one single platform, but the main points that I'm interested in are 2,3,1 (in this order of importance).
  
I'll be eagerly expecting your replies. Have a great day guys and happy trading.

What I'd like to do is try and sum up (as best as possible) what the different stats mean in the most ELI5 way possible for people. I'll go ahead and go first as an example:

r-squared-- R-squared represents how close the performance of a MF is to the benchmark index. The closer to 100 the more closely the assets are tied to a benchmark. This is a good ratio to look at to determine if the MF is just a ""closet index fund.""

The market is doing pretty well right now, therefore funds that short the market are not. What if, working with the assumption that the market is generally going to grow and you're going to do better betting on it, you primarily invested in an index fund but hedged your bets by putting part of your portfolio into an inverse. Then, when the market has a downturn and your inverse fund starts doing well, you sell some (maybe just the gains on that fund) and put the proceeds into the straight index while it's cheap.

It'd probably take more work than I'm capable of figuring out how to do to properly determine the optimal balance and price points, but does this make sense as a long-term investment strategy?",4

Or if it'll even generate an income to offset a ton of the bad decisions ZNGA management has made over the years.

But since it looks like a triple AAA game and it was made literally by a different company (natural motion who is owned by ZNGA) I figure this game will be good.

Anyways, I bought during launch and the stock has dropped 8% since the top...  We won't know how many users are playing until their next quarterly report due Feb 9th (estimated), but I guess I can see how many reviews are coming through the google play store and iphone store.

There is no single answer to this question, but we will also need A LOT MORE information if we are to give some sort of answer

* How old are you?
* Are you employed/making income? How much?
* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)
* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)
* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
* Any big debts?
* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.

1) stock has been sitting near all time highs with the recent SP500 rally. it has faded about 2% since then

2) brick and mortar stores have had a very weak quarter so far and the trend should continue - retail sales missed the mean forecast once again as well . http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-retail-sales-post-smallest-gain-in-3-months-2016-12-14. be on the lookout for what NKE says about guidance next week - almost all the companies in the retail space have issued really weak guidance for next quarter - ANF, AEO, EXPR, URBN, DECK, SKX etc)

3) banks have been issuing downgrades on the stock or are maintaining their price targets of 75~80 after reaching ATHs  signaling that many of them believe from a valuation perspective that this is the peak

4) a sizable amount of insider selling, not just 3 or 4 but like a dozen + this quarter - https://www.bamsec.com/companies/850209/foot-locker-inc

5) this stock's movement is very correllated with the market from what i've seen. on green days this will go up, red days vice versa. i personally believe that we are due for a few days of market selling off and if you share the same thesis this is the perfect pick for you.

my position currently that i aim to hold until FL reaches low 70s. happy trading ya'll

16-12-18,5iyse5,Another good year for PDI.,"
Pimco declared the end of year special distributions for some of their closed end funds.  PDI is a Pimco closed end fund that primarily invests in non-agency mortgage backed securities. 

PDI had a special distribution of $1.45 along with 12 monthly distributions of $0.22, for total income distributed of $4.09 in 2016.  It trades at about $28.50 for a yield of about 14% this year. 

PDI has had similar results in the past. It averages 17% total return since inception (2012) and about 15% over the past three years.

This demonstrates that it might be profitable to invest some money outside of low expense index funds and that when dealing with more complex underlying investments, paying high expense fees can be worth it.  Just keep these investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

Here's a good article about what Pimco considers when investing in non-agency mortgages:

I believe that it has huge upsides for 2017. With a likely increase in oil prices due to OPEC's recent agreement, more US companies will frack as a result. If these companies are going to frack, they want to get as much oil out of the ground as possible. The sand sold at smart sand is supposed to drastically improve the retention rate.

Until I ate at Cava I was convinced that Chipotle would one day rebound to pre-ecoli levels, since there was really no other place to really get fast, cheap food with quality ingredients.  But Cava has manged to duplicate it, and I'd say they even have a wider variety of tastes than Chipotle.  They are DC based and only have around 20 locations right now (mostly mid-Atlantic), but they are growing.  I think they are going to put a serious dent in Chipotle's market share soon.  

I am awful at timing short plays, so I'm not gonna go with puts on Chipotle.  But I am abandoning any idea of a long term rebound for them.  Their moat is done.  Unfortunately Cava is private, otherwise I would be long.",6

16-12-19,5j3iip,DD on $LXRX,"Alright. Boom Bing Bang. Bout to light this bish up.

""According to the National Institutes of Health, a normal A1C is below 5.7 percent. 

If your score is between 5.7 and 6.4 percent, the diagnosis is prediabetes. 

Having prediabetes puts you at risk for developing type 2 diabetes within 10 years. The good news is that you can take steps to prevent or delay progressing to diabetes. If you test positive for prediabetes, it’s a good idea to get retested every year.

If your A1C is 6.5 percent or above, you will probably be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. If you have diabetes, you can reduce the risk of complications by keeping your A1C levels below 7 percent.""

Ok. Understand that. It is important. Im sure most you fags have diabetes neways so you prolly already know this.

Lexixon released their phase 2b results Sep. 11 2014.
""In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 12-week study in 299 patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes on metformin therapy, LX4211 provided a statistically significant reduction in A1C in a dose-dependent manner of 0.42% (75 mg once a day), 0.52% (200 mg once a day), 0.80% (200 mg twice a day), and 0.92% (400 mg once a day) as compared to a 0.09% reduction for placebo (p&lt;0.001 for all doses). Greater A1C reductions were produced by the 400 mg once a day""

This is huge. Why? Because using this new branch of medication to lower A1C levels by up to 1% is crazy. SGLT1 and SGLT2 are new and emerging medications to treat diabetes. Note this drug, LX4211, is a first-in-class dual inhibitor of both SGLT1 and SGLT2.

Quick extra- ""The maximum severity of phototoxic reactions was significantly reduced by afamelanotide treatment compared with placebo (p&lt;0.001)
What this means is that there is very little chance (less than 0.1%, or 1 chance in 1000) of the same reduction in severity of phototoxic reactions occurring by chance"" -defining the P value.

Now, what exactly is this SGLT1? http://www.diabetesincontrol.com/sglt2-inhibitors-a-new-class-of-diabetes-medications/

Alright, how do I profit? Well, ""Lexicon is conducting a second pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial (inTandem2)""  RESULTS DUE BY END OF 2016.

Now. With all this information, and seeing how effective Sotagliflozin was in the phase 2b trials, when the phase three is released I could see an increase upwards of 25% taking place.

RHT is working on an app which connects healthcare professionals and patients, along with the patient's circle of care (i.e. family, friends, anybody able to assist in outpatient care). Their aim is to provide automated monitoring through proximity sensors and wearable biometric devices, and to facilitate communication within the circle of care.

**Pros**

+ There are three already established pilots (Florida, LA, UK), and one white-label contract (to the estimated value of $1.2M; San Antonio, TX) commencing February 2017.

+ The company's and NHS' (UK) aims with regard to treatment are highly aligned, accordingly the NHS has expressed considerable interest in RHT.

+ Progressions towards mHealth (mobile health) incentivized by significant reduction in cost to healthcare systems through ease of administration.

+ Patient outcomes improved through more efficient health monitoring, further reduces costs by mitigating such fines as those imposed by e.g. Medicaid for preventable readmissions. 

+ In future RHT will establish Big Data services, providing another source of revenue.

**Cons**

- Liabilities of ~$1.3M, at present the biggest obstacle for RHT appears to be the accrued debt. Their cash runway is projected to last until Q1-2017, at which point the revenue from the aforementioned contract in TX will be their lifeline, unless they also acquire further financing from other sources.

- Currently not profitable, projection for profitability is in 2017. 

- Some degree of trust to overcome with some patients' expressed worry over cybersecurity.

I have about 25k in taxable, ~6500 in a Roth IRA, ~6500 in a traditional IRA, and 18k in my 401k.  I'm 32, so I'm not terribly worried about short term risk.  

Next year I will be contributing to the Roth as my income has grown to the point where the traditional no longer makes sense.  I'm a little nervous about the market, but not to the point I want to pull anything out.  I just think I need to make sure my non-401k investments go to either international or bonds next year for a slightly more conservative allocation.

The bond funds in my 401k are all terrible and expensive, so the 401k has to stay in stock.

So the questions:

1)  Bonds or international?  My immediate boglehead reaction is bonds.  The things that give me pause are Trump's claims during the election that he wants to default on bonds and negotiate them down.  While this is unlikely, I think it generally speaks to the GOP attitude towards the sanctity of US debt, and it makes me nervous.  The second is that even if everything is hunky dory, we know that interest rates are going to go up relatively quickly and relatively soon.

2)  Which account to put either one in?  Should bonds go in Traditional or Roth (I can swap the stock in the traditional for bonds)?  Should international go in Traditional or Roth?  Is there any case to be made that either one is better in taxable?

3)  If international, I don't want to swing for the fences, I just don't want to correlate strongly with the US.  Should I be looking at regional, or total world (account is with vanguard)?

4)  If bonds, should I be tilting towards corporate bonds or treasuries, or should I just get a total bond fund and forget about it?

Any insights you have would be greatly appreciated.  I know this is  lazy portfolio 101, but I've been second guessing myself a lot and would like some outside perspective.",3

16-12-18,5j1mh3,2 biotechs to keep an eye on (ILMN and LXRX),"**ILMN**

On Friday the January 20th $135/$165 call spread was bought 5,700 times for $5.05 and the trader also sold the $115 puts 5,700 times for $1.75 (Similar to a bullish risk reversal but with the added leg of the short calls). The 3 way spread was traded for a net debit of $3.30 ($1,881,000). The reason it's an extremely bullish trade is because there is unlimited downside potential below $115.

There has been takeover chatter around ILMN in recent months. The rumor is Roche is interested in them, and apparently they were close to a deal a few months back but couldn't agree on a price (according to sources around the rumors). Then ILMN cut guidance on 11/21 and the stock tanked. Recently though there has been chatter again with Roche interested in revisiting the potential takeover now that it's much cheaper. I'm not saying it will get bought out, but it's one to watch.

**LXRX**

On Friday there was a large roll from the December $15 calls to the January 20th $15 calls. The trader closed the December's for $1.55 and bought the Jan's for $2.60, rolling them out for a net debit of $1.05. That's adding an additional $315,000 into it.

LXRX has phase 3 data for Sotaglifozin due by the end of the year, which will be from their 2nd trial. They reported on 9/9 data from their first trial for Sotaglifozin which met its primary endpoint. The stock jumped over 25% on it, but lost all of its gains over the following couple of months and has rebounded again a bit recently.

The roll out in the options was likely to buy more time for this data, and the fact that they added more into the position shows some pretty bullish conviction in it. ",77

My concern is that the transactions occurred in the past 12 months. Is it recommended to incur the additional taxes upfront and make the changes today? Or wait for the full 12 months to pass before making the changes?

16-12-18,5j22ci,Help for my Vanguard portfolio asset allocation,"Hello,

I recently inherited around $60k and I would like to invest it in Vanguard etfs.  I'm 19 years old and considering my age my risk tolerance, my portfolio will be 100% stocks.  However, I'm not sure how I should allocate my portfolio.  I was thinking of investing in VOO (50%), VT (40%) and VNQ (10%).  I like the idea of owning a REIT etf because of its correlation to the S&amp;P 500 is fairly low (50% vs 80% for small cap stocks).  However, I'm not sure about my VOO/VT allocation, because VT is 50% US equity and also because I am almost entirely in large cap companies.  So I would like to have your thoughts on having VTI instead of VOO so I can have a % of small-mid cap companies.  Finally, considering the fact that I'm canadian, should I invest in a S&amp;P/TSX index fund?  If you have any idea on how I should allocate my portfolio (feel free to send links on research papers or articles),  I'd like to hear from them.

EDIT: I would just like to add that I have no debt and that my parents are paying for my college education.  So the money I recieved will be invested for retirement.",0

16-12-19,5j5c1l,Bigger House vs Stocks calculation for better ROI,"I would like someone to help me with this calculation. I'm not really sure where to start. Your opinion regarding this matter is just as good. So here's the story.

I bought a Condo 2 years ago for $70k. My mortgage (including HOA) is $730 (15-Years). About $300 is going towards principal. $53k remaining. My realtor said I could probably sell it for $90k now. 

My current monthly TAKE-HOME post-tax salary is $4.2k. Average monthly spending (including mortgage, other bills, insurance, etc.) is $2k. I am able to save $2.2k per month. Each month, I put 2.2k into the stock market. 

I currently have about $50k in the market. Assuming I'm earning 10% per year, I'm wondering if what I'm currently doing is the best option for me or to buy a bigger house as primary residence. (P.S. Would need to use like $25k from the $50k as down-paymemt).  

I don't really NEED the bigger house, but if it's not really gonna hurt me financially vs the stock market, I don't see why not. 

Let's say I buy a house for $230k, my monthly payment becomes arond $1.6k. So total monthly spending becomes $2.8k and I'll only be contributing $1.4k per month to the Stock market. However, if the housing price grows at 10% per year, won't I be making like 23k per year VS. the stock market 5k per year (50k + 10%)?

Thanks everyone!

tl;dr summary -&gt; I save $2.2k per month after all expenses. I put it all on the stock market. Should I keep doing that or buy a bigger house (if it's just as good of a financial investment).",4

16-12-18,5j2lbq,Question on starting an investment account for nephews,"Hi, 
I am wondering if I can open an investment account for my nephews - something I can put a few hundred dollars in every year. The idea is that I would choose the investments now and when they get to about 10 years I would let them choose the investments ( or whatever age they're able to start understanding the concept somewhat) and teach them how to make these decisions.

I looked into  UGMA/UTMA accounts but on vanguards website saw this as a consideration -  ""There is a significant impact on federal financial aid. The account is treated as the child's asset and weighed more heavily in financial aid calculations"". Just in case i'm able to contribute a significant amount to this account by the time the kids go to college, i do not want their chances of financial aid hampered (they will most likely need it to go to college). How much is too much?

Any thoughts/suggestions?

If this is the wrong sub for it, please let me know where I can post instead.

What is the best piece of advice you wish someone had given you before you started?,"So, I've always though the stock market was some kind of alien language that only elite ivy leaguers could comprehend. A few days ago however, I stumbled upon a video of 17 year old kid driving his brand New Ferrari to high school from money he made in penny stocks. 

Now, I realize he probably got really lucky or whatever, but it was enough to make me investigate further. Fast forward to now, I think it is something I am very interested in. I have started watching some videos by a guy named ""Timothy Sykes"" who apparently is a pretty famous trader. 

I have a large family and I'm working more than 100 hours a week making crap money just to be able to struggle and the idea that I could possibly make enough money to allow me to see my wife and children for more than 20 minutes a day excites me very much.

So my questions are this: Those of you who have been in the game a while what do you wish you had known when you first started, and secondly, is it really, possibly to make a high double digit/low triple digit income being a penny stock trader?

Thank you for entertaining my noob questions.

""Under consideration is a breed of ETF that’s all the rage among the math whizzes who now dominate passive investing. It’s a souped-up version of smart beta known as multifactor, which stuffs two or more investment themes into a single security, for instance value and momentum. Proponents say they’re a way of replicating active managers without their emotions or fees.""

""To get that differentiation, Wells Fargo wants to bring a new concept to ETFs: factor risk parity. In its usual conception, risk parity is a strategy for partitioning a portfolio’s asset classes according to the size of their price swings. In a typical hedge fund portfolio, for instance, stocks would have a smaller chunk, bonds a bigger one, to balance their impact.""

the robots wont work on commission...

Valued at $9B as of 2014, there have been lots of rumors of Thiel wanting to take [Palantir public] (https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/24/why-a-palantir-ipo-might-not-be-far-off/) so that he can spend more of that money on [drinking the blood the of young so he can live forever] (http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/peter-thiel-wants-to-inject-himself-with-young-peoples-blood). 

What does all this shit have to do with wsb? Well the only way I can find for us peasants to invest in Palantir is through $GSVC, which is a $CEF for whom Palantirs compromises 19.24% as of their most recent [10Q] (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1509470/000114420416132525/v452493_10q.htm). Its next 2 holdings, Dropbox and Spotify are also expected to IPO somewhere in 2017. Lyft and Snapchat can also be found further down the list. 

On the other hand, $GSVC has a fair amount of other holdings that sound straight up retarded (who the fuck approved the DogVacay. Inc investment?). And historically, share price suggests that management are as bad at picking private stocks as we are at picking public ones. So despite them buying up stocks over the last year I wouldn't necessarily take that as a positive.

Now is definitely a good time to get in on SVTE.  The 10-K was very promising [Link to 10-K](http://archive.fast-edgar.com//20161214/AFZZB22CZ22FK2Z2222L2WZ3GNM9ZZ2RCD82):  
* Their Gross Margin Increased 86%  
* They Reduced Their Net Losses by over $400k  
* They have only $300k in liabilities and $321k cash on hand!

16-12-19,5j7k2p,"Quant Literature Review: Value &amp; Momentum Everywhere Pt. 1 (Exotic Beta)","I thought I'd do a literature review where I pick out a quant paper that relates to investing. As quantitative strategies continue to have longer holding times, I'm seeing papers and strategies that are applicable for equity investors and vise-versa. I hope this will explain some of the quant world and also help a lot of you with your portfolios!

Let me know if this is helpful for you all or if you want me to change the format!

A bit about me: former institutional quant global macro trader, sharpe of 2, etc. etc on $250mm. Before, I also traded equity derivatives and treasuries. Now I spend my time doing other stuff - which I will leave out of here. Mods - you can PM me and I can verify, but I think some of you already know me.

OK! Onto my favorite quantitative paper ever: **Value &amp; Momentum Everywhere.** http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~lpederse/papers/ValMomEverywhere.pdf

This paper was written by Cliff Asness, founder &amp; CEO of AQR Capital. AQR is one of the largest quant funds out there and is growing rapidly.

**TLDR Takeaway:**
Value strategies and momentum strategies have a negative correlation - which means you can diversify across strategies. Value are mean-reversion plays and momentum are continuation. This paper demonstrated that high-alpha strategies aren't necessary for high alpha (profound idea). Additionally, when testing the validity of a strategy - make sure test across asset classes and also countries/markets.


**So what is exotic beta and what makes this paper so great?**

At a quant conference Cliff was at, there was a debate about what is ""Exotic beta vs alpha?"" I've put forth an answer that so far has yet to be disputed: Exotic beta is a class of strategies where more participants knowing about the strategy, does not reduce its profitability. The profitability is also stable and cyclical. Alpha strategies decrease in profitability as more market participants learn about them.

OK so lets dig with an example. In the paper mentioned above, Cliff et al. make an important observation: momentum strategies and value strategies have a negative correlation AND they were work cross asset-classes and countries.

Why is this important? I was taught that asset prices do 3 things:

1. Continue
1. Mean-Revert
1. Move sideways

Momentum is a continuation pattern (1) and Value is a mean-reversion patter (2). Value is mean reversion as if a stock is under or over-valued, you make the assumption the price will eventually return to what it should be.

In this framework, it makes sense that a continuation and mean-reversion pattern should be opposite. What was profound is that it ""now make sense"" partly because of Cliff's work. Additionally, Cliff showed an amazing way to conduct financial research with exotic beta - test if the strategy works cross-asset and cross-locale.

When doing quantitative research, it's important to make sure there is not overfitting. If a strategy works well across asset classes, and is positively correlated in returns, it means that there is value in the theory. The difficulty in cross-asset application, is that how do you express the idea in a different asset class? For example - what is value in commodities? (There is an answer to this but will leave it out for brevity sake).

In the same way, if investing, does this strategy work well in other asset classes? I've found value strategies do work well across countries and assets, you just have to normalize them for the country/asset class (P/E of a US company may be very different than a South American company).

**Diversification is the Alpha (Exotic Beta really)**

I know - not another diversification paper. What makes this paper so much different, is that AQR promoted the idea of looking at strategies as assets. By viewing strategy returns as assets, we can do the next derivation of diversification. If we were to replace Value and Momentum strategies with Utility and Tech stocks, this paper may read differently. Although that analogy isn't perfect, it's the idea that these returns are their own beta or assets.

We can then decide when to invest/trade in stocks by a combination of factors. If we have 10 strategies and all of them say to buy AAPL, well suddenly we could theoretically have more confidence (of course we would have to backtest this).

Also what's incredible is that value and momentum are incredibly well-studied and published features of markets. Shouldn't they have minimal if any alpha?

Exactly.

By looking at these factors, we see they have positive sharpes/returns but its very cyclical. When momentum makes money, we see that value may not and vise-versa. So even if they both make a little money in the long-term, if we can rebalance we can use the negative correlation to smooth out our return stream.

And one mistake I often see among new quant traders is this desire of have a super high sharpe ratio. This paper presents the opposite. If the sharpes are lower, consistent, and more stable (trait of exotic beta strategies), we can use their diversification to apply alpha.

**We don't need 1 genius high-alpha idea- we can use well-studied numerous strategies with lower sharpes and predictable regimes to generate ""alpha.""**

That idea right there is absolutely mind-blowing!

**So what is applicable to us?**

While traditionally we've been taught diversification, this paper continues to push that narrative but in a different way. It's getting us to not just look at assets as individuals, but also within their own regime. Many of us here know, and probably not by academic education, that asset classes move together and as do countries. We can see it with emerging market themes and baskets. But within those baskets were can group value and momentum, and the fact that they work cross-asset and cross-regime is profound. So it's not just EM, growth, etc. regimes: it's value and momentum regimes

And also, these strategies: value and momentum, have ""low sharpes"" by themselves, but when put together in a portfolio present a 2+2=5 effect.

I hope this was all very helpful for you all. Please let me know if you have any questions.

My official start to this new career started at the beginning of the month.  I had just 26K in my investing account ( 9K goog, 11K S&amp;P, 6k OPK ) and decided its my last chance to day trade margin before that 25k rule kicks in.  I got lucky as balls and made 6k on my first trade.  It has been somewhat of a roller-coaster since then but overall I am up over 20K on about 10 days of trading.  I included about 1K of loses I had trying to trade silver futures... fuck that shit.  [Here are most of my trades from the past couple weeks.](http://imgur.com/a/mCPw8)

My main game-plan so far is timing momentum change.  I also make some trades on other real world information.  For example on interest rate day I bought C calls 2 minutes before the announcement and sold 2 minutes after for some nice gains.  I also bought the goog dip after the announcement.  Today I heard oil was going to drop ( it didnt ) so I waited for early downward momentum to fade on goog and bought some successful calls.  Usually one or two educated plays a day and the rest is just looking for volatile stocks and shooting from the hip.  I don't like to hold any options for more than 10-15 minutes and I try to not hold more then 1 or 2 at a time since I have trouble following multiple charts simultaneously with the street smart tools schwab provides.  I also prefer expensive options due to the crippling commissions when I buy large lots of cheap options.

I would appreciate any advice for someone in my position.  What are the top rules you day traders live by?

So I'm new to options trading, and wanted to get my feet wet. It's the best way for me to learn, kind of like poker...you can't learn if you don't play.
So, on to my scenario. I have purchased 1 call option for tomorrow Dec 21. When buying the option, I used the 
""Buy Open"" Order type. Now, what do I have to do to actually profit off of this. Obviously the strike price has to be met and exceeded, I get that. But, can I simply let the option expire and I'll automatically be paid? I don't want the 100 shares (which means I don't want to exercise, right?) so do I have to 
""sell close"" my call option tomorrow if the strike price is met.

If I max out my 401K (18k), it should effectively reduce my taxable income, right? Does that mean I really made 118,100 - 18k in the eyes of the IRS? I also have a brokerage account, will any gains I have in here just be added as adjusted gross income as well? If so, I will be at around 119k+.

If I do the calculation on their website, it seems I will only be able to contribute around $5000-5100.

If the rules are correct, you have to pay a 6% excise tax on the amount you over contribute, is that right? So you pay 400 * .06, and no problems, correct?

Otherwise, it seems I can also just.......sell $400~ worth of funds in my Roth IRA, and move it to my brokerage account, and not have any problems either it seems?

16-12-20,5jedv7,Outcomes of Investing in OTC Stocks,"Here is a new paper by SEC Division of Economic and Risk Analysis by Joshua T. White, published on December 16, 2016.

&gt;This paper analyzes three aspects of over-the-counter (OTC) stocks: (1) the recent trends in the OTC stock market structure and size; (2) the documented properties of OTC stocks; and (3) the differences in returns based on investor and stock characteristics. 

&gt;Approximately 10,000 OTC stocks were quoted at the end of 2013 through 2015, generating a total trading volume of over $200 billion per year. Dollar volume has grown substantially since 2012 and is now concentrated in the segment of the OTC market with no requirements of registration or reporting to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A synthesis of recent academic literature reveals troubling properties of OTC stocks. Academic studies find that OTC stocks tend to be highly illiquid; are frequent targets of alleged market manipulation; generate negative and volatile investment returns on average; and rarely grow into a large company or transition to listing on a stock exchange. Moreover, these properties tend to worsen when the OTC company has fewer disclosure-related eligibility requirements. 

&gt;I examine the relationship between OTC investor demographics and investment outcomes using a proprietary database of transaction-level OTC data with confidential investor information. Analysis of 1.8 million trades by over 200,000 individual investors confirms that the typical OTC investment return is severely negative. Investor outcomes worsen for OTC stocks that experience a promotional campaign or have weaker disclosure-related eligibility requirements. Demographic analysis reveals that older, retired, low-income, and less educated investors experience significantly poorer outcomes in OTC stock markets. Given that retail investors are the predominant owners of OTC stocks, and the documented trend towards less transparent OTC companies, the results of this study have important implications for investor protection.

Im an American living and working in Canada and I am wanting to invest the Canadian money Im earning.  I could just convert it and send back to the states for my US accounts. But I was curious about keeping the currency local and investing directly and its tax implications.

RRSP’s seem to be the go-to investment vehicle for Americans in Canada.


If I invest and buy and sell stocks within an RRSP I only pay taxes when funds are withdrawn from the RRSP? 

When withdrawing funds from and RRSP (or what would be an RIFF at the time). You are taxed at your regular income tax rate because the original RRSP contributions were tax deductible correct?

But the USA when filing my US return I imagine wont recognize the deductible contribution so I will have to pay taxes on that correct?
So when the time comes to cash out my RRSP I'll get taxed twice by the US on that money...they'll tax the initial contributions (because they don't recognize it as a deductible) and then they'll tax the distribution when I cash out the RRSP?

If I were to just open a regular investment account at a brokerage I’d pay the 50% realized capital gains at my individual tax rate.
How does this work out when it comes to filing my US Tax return? Will the US want to tax my capital gains again? How does the Canada-US tax treaty work when it comes to investments and capital gains?

I always assumed that when I bought shares in USD - IB would exchange the amount needed for the purchase from EUR to USD. And when i sold, it would do the opposite. In this case I would profit from the rising dollar. As it turns out however, that's not how it works at all, as instead I borrow the needed amount and the loan is reversed when I sell. As a result, My returns are decimated by the rise in USD. 

From what I understand - I should have exchanged my entire cash position to at the start before investing. My question is: is it too late to do this? or can I somehow still 'reset the loan' made for my investments and switch to USD all together?

The question is a matter of what price they will sell for. In light of a booming stock market, I have been shopping through to see what futures have to offer. My investing strategy is to buy low and sell high. What's low now? Corn, wheat, rice, natural gas, crude, cocoa has been falling, coffee, gold, silver, platinum and soybean oil.

There are some ETFs that make buying into these things relatively easy. Teucrium runs $CORN and $WEAT, Barclay's has ETNs on Cocoa and Coffee, but for some reason ETNs sound a bit troublesome by their setup, I wish there were an ETF on natural gas, all of the companies producing this are very heavily in debt, but acceptable choices can be found for crude production. I did find an ETF on platinum, but it looks like it gets taxed as a PFIC (Passive Foreign Investment Company), making it a very complicated business to be getting into. Asides from that, I would like to get into the others if I could, but not readily seeing ways to do that just yet.

## Do Index Buyers Make Over-Valued Stocks More Over-Valued?

There have been some damning commentary, e.g. from Goldmans calling ETFs a bubble machine that

&gt; guarantees that the most valuable company stays the most valuable, and gets more valuable and keeps going up

But as a Harvard professor postulated

&gt; Holding a stock in proportion to its capitalization weight does not change the likelihood that the stock is overvalued or undervalued. The notion that capitalization weighting imposes an intrinsic drag on performance is, accordingly, false.

I prefer the views of a Harvard professor to a Goldmans alumni. Personal prejudice of course!

#Industry News
•	Offshore Drilling: President Obama permanently blocked oil and gas drilling in federally controlled areas of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, as well as areas off of the East Coast of the continental U.S. The move comes after environmentalists have called upon the President to put Arctic waters off limits to drilling following Shell’s failed attempt to drill in the area. Obama will employ a little-used provision of the Offshore Continental Shelf Lands Act, which allows presidents to designate offshore areas as national monuments in a process similar to that of Antiquities Act which presidents have often called upon to create national monument sites. The Offshore Continental Shelf Lands Act authorizes the president to make these designations without the approval of Congress. Congress can override such designations, but would require 60 votes in the Senate. The president is not expressly authorized to do so. No president has ever sought to repeal a monument designation, putting such an effort by Trump in uncharted legal territory should it come to pass.

•	Saudi Arabia: Will announce fuel price increases of 40% when it launches its general budget for 2017 on Thursday, local newspaper Al-Watan reported Tuesday.  The Council of Economic and Development Affairs, chaired by Deputy Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman, met Monday to discuss the draft budget, which will also include a 20% rise in electricity tariffs, Al-Watan said.  The ministry of finance was not available for comment.  If confirmed, the increase in fuel and power prices would be the second after the kingdom made a dramatic change in policy last year. In its 2016 budget, it increased long-standing prices for gasoline and domestic gas for power generation as well as ethane feedstock as part of a broader program to cut subsidies and reduce the budget deficit.

#Company News 
•	ENLK: EnLink Midstream Partners and EnLink Midstream announce non-core divestiture transactions. EnLink agreed to monetize its approximately 31% common ownership interest in HEP for net proceeds of approximately $190M. Alberta Investment Management corp and management will acquire a common ownership stake in HEP as a result of EnLink's divestiture, which follows AIMCo's preferred investment in HEP in August 2016 Blended multiple of 16x is attractive and the co’s are accelerating SCOOP/STACK development a plus with this announcement. Expect stock to react favorably now that Tall Oak installment and '17 capex funding in good shape Asset sale proceeds and anticipated ongoing equity sales should fund 2017 capital needs alleviating any fears of a equity overnight or expanded preferred issuance. Louisiana ngl operations should be full in the second half setting up some sort of NGL handling expansion and/or either the Oklahoma Express pipe project or further processing expansion in Oklahoma.

#Trading Recap
•	HFs were net buyers of N. American equities on Tuesday due to both longs added and shorts covered. ETFs were the most net bought while Cons Disc was the most net sold; most single-name sectors had paired off activity yesterday. It is notable that the slight reversal in sector trends continued yesterday, as Info Tech was net bought and Financials were net sold. Energy was net sold yesterday and has been net sold for 9 of the past 11 trading sessions; Yesterday’s activity was once again driven by E&amp;P.

#Econ/Macro
•	Cyclical Trade: The cyclical trade recovered yesterday (MSZZCYDE +50bps) lead by Financials +112 &amp; Industrials +62bps and despite weak volumes we did see extensions of the post-election thematic trades.  Financials continue to separate from other sectors,  FIN/FANG spread increased to 19.8% since Election &amp; Domestic companies continue to outperform those that are Internationally levered. (MS)

Now the stock is at $210. 

$TSLA has been a favorite among traders. It has a very high velocity, which means that it tends to peak out within 4 months, and then reach a trough within about 4~6 months. 

However, I think this time it's going to be different. 

The Model 3 is ramping out production by mid-late 2017 and Gigafactory expansion is happening as we speak. 

There are numerous quasi-insider rumors that Tesla will soon become profitable for the long term. 

Don't forget, the main driver of  TSLA stock has been irrationality surrounding its growth. Also, the second most important driver has been oil prices. Profitability has NOT been a driver for TSLA stock. 

I expect $TSLA to reach $350 by early 2018 and $500 by 2019. 

Again, guys. The price behind TSLA is mostly irrational and driven by major hedge funds who are betting for a major auto revolution. 

I believe that both Republicans and Democrats are interested in TSLA due to the fact that it could revolutionize the US automotive industry. ",0

16-12-21,5jkceo,"Goldman Says Bonds, not Stocks, Have Properly Priced In Trumponomics","http://bloom.bg/2hQoInq

Fixed income has traditionally been a more efficient market due to the lack of retail ""noise"" if you will.  Is this time any different? Are the good ol boys at Goldman just talking out of both sides of their mouth again?  What say ye? 

Also this is actually a solid and mostly unbiased read about which policies have what effect.

&gt;The stunning run in equities ""post-Trump appears to have looked past the fact that the economy is already running close to full employment,"" write analysts Charles Himmelberg and James Weldon.


&gt;This implies that any new tailwind for U.S. activity — say, from a massive fiscal stimulus — would end up boosting inflation more than growth as it would force the economy to rub up against its supply-side constraints. Economic output can only grow as much as the labor and capital available to produce it — and an aging U.S. population places a demographic damper on available man-hours of work.

Well, traditionally the US has steered clear of Japan style aging population constraints by having a healthy inflow of younger immigrants to expand the labor/capital pool.  Traditionally at least. ",167

16-12-21,5jn2gt,Explain end of the world economics with Trump,"Things to keep in mind: Trump tax cuts (corps and citizens), outstanding US debt.

In every possible scenario I see American corporations coming out ahead and citizens having extra money in their pocket. 

What if the ratio of income tax (now that it is taxed less per individual citizen) is less than the ratio of compounding debt?

Corporations will keep reaping up money, consumers will keep spending, but the US debt keeps going up. (granted at a slower pace but up irregardless). What is the sweet spot in where we have to employ people to make up for the tax cuts that Trump is proposing? And would these tax cuts truly generate the much needed income that we need to beat our deficit?

What if it doesn't work? What happens if corporations keep gaining money but the US keeps on going further in debt? What happens then? And when will corporations actually start feeling the effect of the national debt? Or are they totally separate and it just doesn't matter? 
In the end, everything depends on consumer spending; and every business and service is ultimately made to cater to the normal citizen wanting to spend money on leisure or necessities.

Sounds like a lot of questions and I'm not sure if I got my real question across. I think tax cuts right now when our debt is excessive is a bad idea. I think that we won't have enough people to work because corporations will not put out those jobs here in the USA despite what Trump wants. Corporations do not reinvest in their country anymore, they reinvest in themselves or just hoard their money. That being said, I'm glad I'm invested, but I'm not sure how long that will be sustainable if we cannot abolish our debt.

16-12-21,5jnc17,Defined benefit plan (Pension) vs Stock Options,"Hi everyone, I was wondering if anyone can help with my situation. I am currently considering changing careers from my current company that provides 401K (4% matching for each 1% up to 8%) and defined benefit plan (traditional pension) as well. The new company i am thinking of moving to provides 401K benefits (50% for each 1% up to 6%) and stock options at a 10% discount but no traditional pension. I know the 401K option is much better with my current company however i am finding it difficult to assess the pension vs company stock benefit between the two. I am vested with my current company and been working there for 10 years but still have at least 20 years in my career. I really do like the new company's opportunities for career advancements and will probably make more money salary wise (20% increase) but want to make sure i am making the right investment decision by giving up my defined benefit plan (pension) if i leave. Please let me know if you have any questions.

**Edit** The pension is calculated as follows: 1.6% of monthly Highest Average Earnings TIMES years of Accrual Service LESS Social Security offset. The offset is 1.35 percent of the projected age-65 Primary Social Security Benefit for each year of Benefit Accrual Service, up to a maximum offset percentage of 45 percent after 33⅓ years (1.35 percent ×33⅓ years = 45 percent).

Sorry if this is a stupid question, but I'm wondering how official is the deal? I know that it must go through approvals and such, but wasn't too sure if there will be a lot of opposition. I've tried looking at different news articles regarding potential blocks/resistance to this deal and haven't really found any (other than the typical bureaucratic red tape that they'll need to go through to get cleared). 

I currently own positions in NXP and am trying to decide if I should add positions in it (not because of the $110/share that QCOM is offering) or I should just start buying QCOM once the deal/merge happens.

Back about 8 years ago when all the banks were folding and their stock prices were plummeting. I figured the ones who survive would have to recover eventually. Since the government was forcing BAC to take over other companies they seemed like a good bet...

This was right after college so I didn't have all that much money so I bought 20 shares right at $20. I kept buying it down, with as many shares as I felt comfortable buying, and ended up with 350 shares at just over $7/share on average. 

Needless to say, 8 years later, I was pretty happy when BAC finally hit $20 again. 

Now only if they'd bring that dividend back up to $0.64...

16-12-21,5jla1h,How to get long like Donkey Kong in 2017,"Alright, you bearish twats, listen up.  

Economic data is looking good, inflation is starting to show up, and the fed is reacting responsibly, paving the way for a nice, steady run from here.  The market shook off 2 major corrections in the last 18 months, brexit, italy reform votes, trump, etc and continues on, stronger than ever.  All major catalysts for a crash seem to be behind us and 2017 looks like it's gonna be smooth sailing.   Accordingly, I'm putting together my shopping list for getting long as shit going into Q1 of 2017.  If you are firing your keyboard to respond with some bullshit about how zerohedge told you the fed has built a house of cards economy that will collapse any day now, you can just fuck right off and not waste your time replying, because I don't give a shit. 

I'll be doing this by buying puts on leveraged bearish ETFs.  Why leveraged ETFs?  Well, some of you know [I'm a fan of a little leverage](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/41knq2/bounce_back_with_leverage_somewhere_between/) especially the cheap, non-callable leverage offered by leveraged ETFs.  Before people start screaming about ""leverage decay"", you should know that when it comes to long/bull equity ETFs, [leverage decay is a myth](http://ddnum.com/articles/leveragedETFs.php).  However, it *is* true that bearish or commodity equity ETFS - which lack the upward bias of long equity ETFs - are prone to compounding decay/leverage decay and tend to go down even in flat markets or short-term corrections.  Accordingly, a great way to go super long on an equity index is to buy puts on its leveraged inverse.  Theta loss is minimal compared to the negative compounding enhanced by volatility and in a market making a nice run upward, this effect is magnified.   You also get leveraged exposure to the market without risking [a margin call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TruXhuAO4IY).  Here are the three I'm starting to build a position in:

**TZA January 2018 Puts**  
TZA is Direxion's 3x daily small-cap bear ETF.  It is extremely volatile, so will tend to go down quickly in anything but a prolonged bear market. Even then: TZA had a negative return from Nov 2008 to January of 2009 - a time period where SPY was down *10 fucking percent*.  So TZA s pretty much going to go down no matter what, making this a very safe play if you're expecting anything besides financial Armageddon. 

The Jan 2018 $15 Puts are currently trading for about $2.20 and TZA is at $19.  If TZA does it's typical 50%/year decline, we should expect TZA to finish 2017 at $10 or less, meaning those puts will gain about 100-200%.   The $20 and $25 puts have some volume and offer more trading opportunities and margin for error, but won't return quite as much.  I'll aim to get the $15s for under $2.00.  TZA puts will probably be my biggest position for this trade. 

**FAZ January 2018 Puts**  
FAZ is the 3x daily financial bear ETF.  I think banks are set for a nice run in 2017, and this is a good way to go long on financials. 

The Jan 2018 $20 puts are your best bet here, but they are thinly traded for now.  I got in at $3.60 and will try to add more on dips, hoping to acquire a few at a basis below $3.00.  I will probably take the smallest position in FAZ, relative to the others, with maybe only a few contracts total. 

**UVXY January 2018 Puts**  
Ah, UVXY, my favorite.  Double the inverse of the daily change of the VIX short term futures index.  Not inverse VIX, not inverse VXST, not inverse the SPY, or whatever other bullshit people think UVXY tracks.  **It tracks 2x the daily inverse of the VIX short term futures index** (I'll make a post on this later).  That means it's susceptible to contango, compounding decay, and the difference in expected vol vs realized vol, aka the risk premium.  All these factors conspire to bring UVXY down about 75% per year.  

The $1 and $5 puts are both good options here, with the $1 offering 200-400% returns if it goes ITM in Q4 of 2017 and the $5 puts offering 30-100% returns if you get in low single digits in the same time period.   I have quite a few of both, but will be adding more on market dips. 

**Conclusion**  
So there you go: you can buy puts on this garbage and profit handsomely.  Or don't, I don't really give a shit.  I am long puts on all three of these ETFs and intend to buy many more in the next couple months.  So far, I've only put a toe in the water with about a grand, but I'm shooting for about a $5k position in the next couple of months.  [Proof of trade](http://imgur.com/HGzDytl).  My goal will be a return of about $10k on the overall trade, perhaps more if we have a nice correction in January and I can really average down.  I will probably do about $3k in TZA puts and $1k in each of UVXY and FAZ puts.

I view this as a fairly risky trade (albeit with a defined risk) and a large potential payoff, meaning I'll only be doing this with money I can afford to lose.  If you don't have experience with options and can't afford to lose money, don't do this.  Even then, you shouldn't do this trade, because I'm just some dude on the internet you don't know, and if you take this as advice, you're an idiot and deserve to lose all your money.   Good luck!

**Note about shorting leveraged ETFs**    
If you want to be a cheap asshole and try to save a few bucks by just shorting these instead of buying puts, know that all three are highly volatile and prone to massive spikes whenever the market gets afraid.  You can very easily blow up your account shorting these.  I do not recommend that at all.  This trade is risky enough as is, don't add margin risk to it as well.   You can offload that risk for literal pennies on the dollar buy buying puts instead.  If you have liquidity troubles with buying the long dated OTM puts, you could theoretically short the underlying and just cover your position with a long call and create a synthetic long put position, but you are still paying for theta on the call in that case (plus borrowing fees to short, if applicable).

**Note about options on UVXY**  
UVXY is currently trading at $7.8.  It's due for a 5:1 reverse split any day now, and no doubt they'll have to reverse split at least once or twice more in 2017.  Assuming 2 more 5:1 RS between now and this time next year, UVXY has an adjusted value of $195 right now.  If we look at the $1 puts, those will be equivalent to a $25 put, post-splits, which is about an 87% loss of it's current value.  So far, UVXY has returned -95% this year, and that number even accounts for massive spikes from the January correction, Brexit, US Election, that random spike in September, etc.  So an 87% decline is totally reasonable.   Why do I mention the reverse splits?  Because if you buy options on UVXY now, you should expect that your deliverable shares per contracts will be reduced by 5x each time.  So if you buy 25 contracts now for 2500 total deliverable shares, you'll have only 100 deliverable shares after two rounds of splits.  It doesn't affect the profitability (or lack thereof) but it is something to keep in mind if you don't have experience with odd lot options contracts. ",59

I am generally not too interested in stocks like Amazon and Apple. Ideally there would be a screen with a bunch of commodity charts of an adjustable duration. Thanks for your input guys.",0
16-12-21,5jlob0,Thoughts on SUN,Sunoco LP. I am in at about $22. They currently have a 13.9% dividend that may not be sustainable due to the fact that they keep adding debt and have a payout ratio of 140%. However they have a reliable cash flow and were upgraded by credit suisse to outperform today. Which is why its up 6%. Is this a good position to keep or add to?,2

16-12-22,5joar0,"Trump Names Peter Schiff As Next Fed Chair, Replacing Janet Yellen","Donald Trump selected a new key figure on Wednesday. Peter Schiff, a long-time critic of Federal Reserve policies, was announced as the chair of the Federal Reserve. He will replace Janet Yellen at the end of her term in February 2018.

President-elect Trump spoke highly of Schiff. ""This guy is a genius. He predicted the financial crisis. So he knows how to prevent the next one. Everyone agrees, he is right twice a day.""

16-12-21,5jlugm,Bull Trap,"In investing, a bull trap is a false sense of security that a stock or commodity will keep going up regardless of the very real and probable risk of a significant fall at some point in the future.  On a macro level (i.e. over several years) oil is going the way of the dodo bird.  IMO, calls to the contrary are considered bull trap.  If you are buying XOM or any other petroleum related stock for the long term, IMO your days are limited.  Learn from coal's history.

It is already much cheaper to drive a mile in an electric vehicle than it is to drive that same mile in an internal combustion vehicle, and in the future, it will only continue to get cheaper.  Consider the fact that in Texas they are giving away free electricity from wind turbines in the wee hours of the night because the wind keeps blowing and there is not enough demand to charge customers.  How bout charging your EV for free over night?  How does a 100% discount on your gas sound?  Pretty good to me.  Even at 12 cents a kWh, it is 50% cheaper to drive an EV than it is to drive an equivalent ICE V.  50% is not chump change.  

I can already hear people going off the rails with frustration that my arguments are from an ""environmentalist"" and that this post is spam.  Oh contrair: My premise is relevant, real, sound and far reaching.  The main arguments that ICE vehicles are in fact cheaper to drive is sticker price, time to charge, range anxiety, battery life and other just plain red herrings.  No one worth their salt buys a new ICE car for less than 35k , the relative price of EVs is set to accelerate downward in the very near future, range is a non issue, battery life is equivalent to transmission life or other O&amp;M costs of an ICE; yada yada yada.  Substitute electricity for oil in the transportation sector and oil simply goes away.  Plus, ICE emissions smell really, really bad.  I am not advocating this in any way, but imagine turning your ICE vehicle on, closing your garage door, and sitting inside your car on a windy day, smelling the future of oil, oil everywhere (as Arnold Schwarzenegger so eloquently put it).

Electric Rail: ever been to Europe? How about the Bay area or New York? Electric Trucking: Ever seen an electric bus? How far removed are they to electric trucks? By and large, people don't heat their buildings with oil, but what about geothermal, or *gasp* electricity.  Average selling price of a new ICE car is RIGHT NOW less than 35K, what is the average selling price of a new ICE car going to be relative to electric a few years from now? And if the price of oil is much higher, then the relative cost of EVs keeps getting better. The equation is simple. Reduced demand for oil in the transportation sector will equate with lower prices of oil in the long term. EIA projections of endless increasing demand for oil is short sighted and misses the non black ""black swan"" of dramatically lower costs for EVs.

As always, your replies are greatly appreciated, but please remember: I am talking about long term investing, so don't go all batshit crazy on me that EVs, ICE Vs, and wind power don't add up to the price of oil.  Short oil over the long term.  The trend will be your friend.  I am not trying to get banned from /r/investing nor do I think the post merits it.  IMO this post is relevant to investing and has merit to open minded people.  Please do a tiny bit of research to verify my premise:

I started studying HR this year because I wasnt eligible for free tuition in finance, but next year I'm planning to switch to finance (long story, but i will be eligible for free tuition). My problem is that I'm not sure what I want to become. I keep hearing about people who finished finance that ended up with a job they hate, I'm worried that I will become one of those people. So my questions are


 1. Is finance really that boring?
 
 
 2. What jobs are there in finance which are overall rewarding (not just in salary)?

 
 3. Should I really switch to finance from HR?


About me: 

I'm quite competitive, social and analytical. I like thinking about what the future will be like and I like reading about companies, the world's happenings and it's consequences. I have messed around with stocks in the past in demo trader apps and I enjoyed that aswell. I would hate to sit inside an office all the time, I'd like a job that is meaningful and not monotonous.

I'm not sure if this is kosher to post this here (If it is not, i apologize).

I got tired of trying to sort through all of the crap on Twitter to find the good Finance data. There is a TON of useful information, but it's under a mountain of crap. Additionally it takes a long time to find and developer a follow-list of good/reliable souces on there. 

So, I enlisted some friends, and we've developed a *free* website that uses AI-type technologies like Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, etc. It's basically a ""smart"" tweetdeck focused on investing/financial twitter.

We've been using it and working on it for so long, that i wanted to get some 'fresh' minds using it, to see how we can improve it and make it more useful to the investing community.

I have a habit of looking for relevant stocks in the same industry as stocks I like. Such as finding AMBA and AMAT in semiconductors since I like AMD and NVDA. Amat has done decent but Amba was poor and will continue to be poor till they shake off gopro as their main income unfortunately.

A new way I might make a main method is searching for stocks that have done very well in the past 52 weeks, but in the past week have taken a small dip of about 5%. Seems like a promising method to buy the dips of decent stocks.

Anyways what do you search for when using a stock screener? I'm looking for new methods to find good opportunities. ",14

16-12-22,5jse8g,Strategies: how to successfully jump on in trends,"Hello!

The question may be stupid, but I am a new investor, with until now mainly theoretical (Bachelor of Finance) knowledge. Though such question would have been asked, but did not find anything during last 2 years. So, **how do you correctly jump in on strong-buys and trends?** 

Example: let's say $MU today. Yesterday after hours I saw a lot of buzz about it, did due diligence, checked market sentiment and decided that I will try to put my portfolio's speculative part on this. Put a limit order at 21.00. However, when the market opened, it skyrocketed to 23.00 and my order did not go through. So, what should I have done? When is the best time to check next days investments? Was I way too late to the hype train? Should I have just put market order or higher limit?

*Unrelated: What are the thoughts on $AMD and $NVDA? Would any of you buy in today, or rather wait for some dip? Long-term growth opportunities look nice for both, but I am here talking more about speculative buy-gain-sell position. Similar with $MU.*

TLDR: When is the correct time to join on trends: before market closes or with a limit order in the morning? Thoughts on $AMD, $NVDA, $MU?",25

I have figured out how to pull the annual dividend for a company into the sheet but am running into a few problems. I have received dividends for a lesser amount of shares than I currently have (have 35 shares of X stock and received dividends for 29 shares q3, then dividends for 35 shares q4). Not the biggest deal but...

To solve this I figure I can create another sheet for a dividend table; a timeline of dividend payouts for all of my stocks. However, I'm not sure how to do this without manually inputting everything. Obviously dividends are subject to change so I don't want to pull data for past payouts and I don't want to factor in dividends I haven't received yet into my return. I'd rather not manually input everything then change the formula incorporating dividends into the return every time I make a change.

I can't think of a way to avoid doing this manually. Do any of you guys already have a more elegant solution?",2

I intended to transfer the money from my John Hancock 401k to the Prudential 401k directly, but due to bad information from John Hancock, the money was transferred to my checking account wihtout taxes being withheld.  Now John Hancock is telling me that the easiest way to fix this is to send a check to Prudential for the same amount and it will be okay because the IRS allows 60 days for these kind of transfers.  Prudential is telling me that John Hancock should reverse the credit to my checking account and initial a new transfer directly to Prudential.

16-12-22,5jqfsq,The real Nokia,"I've seen a lot of posts about Nokia. You people are, I get it, idiots that love to lose money, I know this and you know this. But lettuce pretend that I am not (in reality, I am so fuck me sideways and call me Pedro Sue). I am not saying mobile is going away but hear me out.

In my opinion (just my fairy opinion sprinkled with crack on some hummus) the only thing Nokia has is software (and mobile security). These are two important segments. However, Nokia is not the play. BlackBerry is the play. They've got better software solutions, are no longer in mobile hardware (read smartphones faggot) they instead now license out, and are pursing vehicle-2-vehicle solutions (among other IoT solutions). [That is the Internet of Things dipshit].

This was updated guidance based on Q3 results released yesterday:

""BlackBerry (NASDAQ:BBRY) posted a relatively mixed set of Q3 FY’17 results, beating market expectations on earnings amid cost cutting and a lower mix of hardware sales. However, the firm’s revenues fell short of consensus, on account of lower than expected software revenues,causing BlackBerry’s stock to close roughly 3% lower in Tuesday’s trading.That said, the outlook is improving, with the firm projecting an adjusted profit for the full fiscal year, compared to its previous guidance ofbreak-even to a $0.05 loss per share, driven by an increasingly software and services-focused revenue mix. Below, we outline some of the key takeaways from BlackBerrys earnings for the quarter.

Trefis has an $8 price estimate for BlackBerry, which is slightly ahead of the current market price. We will be updating our price estimate to account for the earnings release.

See our complete analysis for BlackBerry here

Enterprise Mobility Solutions Drive Software Growth

BlackBerrys adjusted software and services revenue stood at about $172 million, marking year-over-year growth of about 49%, excluding intellectual property licensing, which had a significant revenue contribution during Q3 FY’16.The firms enterprise mobility software remained the key driver of software sales, with 3000+ customer adds for the quarter, marking a slightly uptick over Q2.BlackBerry noted that ~80% of its software and services revenue, excluding patent licensing and professional services, is now recurring,given the firm’s transition from a sales model to a licensing model. The firm has also taken some steps tounify its various enterprise mobility and security offerings, launching the BlackBerry Secure suite earlier this month, enabling it toprovide end-to-end security solutions to businesses and governments who want to protect their mobile devices and computer systems (related: What BlackBerry Aims To Achieve With Its Latest Security Offering). BlackBerry expects its adjusted software and services revenues to grow at around 30% year-over-year in fiscal 2017, with growth outpacing the broader enterprise mobility software market in FY’18.

The relative revenue stability in the enterprise software space is giving BlackBerry headroom to expand its other software businesses such as automotive solutions and Internet of Things. Last quarter, BlackBerry stucka deal to work directly with Ford Motor Companyto expand its use of BlackBerry QNX and security software, effectively making it a Tier-1 supplier. (related: Why BlackBerrys Software Deal With Ford Is Promising) Most of the firm’s previous auto deals were done withinfotainment hardware vendors, who in turn sell products to automakers. BlackBerrys IoT business is also slowly coming to fruition. The firm’s Radar solution, which caters to the fast growing fleet management market, saw some business development activity, winninga contract with a U.S. trucking firm called Titanium Transportation in Q3. The productalso has anothersixpilot deploymentsunderway with other companies. The business model for Radar calls for a small upfront fee, with companies paying a monthly fee for monitoring and services.

Handset Business Shrinks, But Shift To Licensing Will Help Bolster Margins

Sales of BlackBerrys handsets dropped to $62 million from $220 million in Q3 FY’16, amid a weak uptake for the firm’s new Android based devices. However, the division sawgross margins improve to about 44%, with operating income coming in at $5 million, versus a lossduring the previous quarter, driven by BlackBerrys move to increasingly outsource production. Margins could improve significantly over fiscal 2018 as well, as BlackBerry largely transitions into the licensing revenue model, ending its internal hardware development and sales. (related: BlackBerry Does The Right Thing By Pulling The Plug On Handset Development)

Gross margins for licensing are expected to be significant (~90% per BlackBerry), given the low variable costs and reliance on BlackBerrys existing software assets and brand name. BlackBerry will essentially provide its secure Android software and applications such as BlackBerry Hub, while its hardware partners will take care of the design, manufacturing and marketing of the smartphones. The firm currently has deals with a hardware manufacturer in Indonesia and also with Chinas TCL, which is expected to market BlackBerry devices globally, excluding a few Asian markets.""

Victory is upon us my friend; it is only a matter of a few weeks, and the entire war will begin drawing to a close. Trump and his team are miles above the tired old lies that our opponents have used to date. They have many concrete reasons to see this get wrapped up. Mortgage Interest rates have shot up and will be headed higher throughout 2017. Left unchecked this will inevitably slow down housing and could take out our anemic economic recovery. Trump will use the resolution of the GSE battle to get millions of home buyers who have been stuck on the sidelines back into the market.

I am not concerned at all, Steve Mnuchin is a man of incredible character and has an extraordinary understanding of our financial markets. What we are seeing and will continue to see is the Democrats doing everything they can to portray Steve as a financial demon. They will try to inflict as much damage as they can on him as a way to taint Trump. This is nothing new if the Democrats had won we would see the Republicans do the same. There is no chance of him not passing into the Treasury because all he needs is a simple majority. The Republicans control the Senate so his passage his assured. Now with that said I would not be surprised to see our many enemies in the media use this as a way to try and discourage us.I also wouldn’t be surprised if certain “analysts” misread this as well.

16-12-22,5jqjix,Canadian Telecoms and a Hostile Regulatory Environment,"So for those unaware of the telecom landscape in Canada, there are 3 big players. Rogers, Bell and Telus and they have pretty much owned the market (barring small competition in select provinces) forever.

In the past couple of years the CRTC has been under intense pressure to lower costs for consumers regarding wireless, internet and TV bills.

In 2013 there were rumours that Verizon would be coming to Canada and as a result all of the Canadian telecoms took a hit at the time, but when that was confirmed to not be happening they recovered.

Fast forward to today where the CRTC is once again ramping up pressure on the telecoms, recently mandating that the big 3 must lower their wholesale renting prices to 3rd party buyers such as Tekksavvy which has resulted in lower internet prices for Tekksavvy customers.

Just yesterday the CRTC ruled that internet is a basic necessity for all of Canadians.

So my question is, with this increasingly hostile environment for Canadian telecoms (as just one headwind) is there concern down the line from an investor perspective that their profitability will suffer? They have been able to maneuver around the CRTC for a while, but that may not be the case anymore. As a consumer I am happy, but as an investor I am conflicted.

Anyway I'm just looking for your input and discussion.

Every paycheck some of my retirement money goes into a commission free small growth international ETF that I am using as an accumulation fund (SCHC at Schwab).  When I save enough money I would like to buy a smaller, more valuey international ETF where I am charged an $8.95 commission (DLS, if it matters).  Unfortunately the two funds are not highly correlated there are no commission free international small cap value ETFs with Schwab as of yet (nor anywhere, if I am not mistaken).  
 
&amp;nbsp;

Is there a rule of thumb for how often to spend the $8.95 commission, selling SCHC and buying DLS?  Obviously the cost is the $8.95 plus the bid/ask spreads.

(NASDAQ:ETRM), the developer of medical devices using neuroblocking technology to treat obesity, metabolic diseases and other gastrointestinal disorders, today announced that the EnteroMedics Board of Directors has declared a 1-for-70 reverse stock split of the Company's common stock, which will be effective for trading purposes upon the commencement of trading on December 28, 2016. As of that date, each 70 shares of issued and outstanding common stock and equivalents will be converted into 1 share of common stock. Any fractional shares of common stock resulting from the reverse stock split will be rounded up to the nearest whole share and any fractional shares of common stock issuable pursuant to stock options or warrants will be rounded down to the nearest whole share.  The reverse stock split is being effected as part of the Company's plan to regain compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price continued listing requirement of the NASDAQ Capital Market. EnteroMedics stockholders will receive instructions from its transfer agent, Wells Fargo Bank National Association, as to procedures for exchanging existing stock certificates for new certificates or book-entry shares.

Additionally, the Company announced that all $18.75 million of its Senior Amortizing Convertible Notes (the ""Notes"") will be converted as of Tuesday, December 27, 2016, into shares of common stock or amortized through issuances of stock and so will no longer be outstanding as of that date. The Notes were issued to four institutional investors pursuant to a securities purchase agreement dated as of November 4, 2015.  Under the terms of the securities purchase agreement, the Company issued $1.5 million of the Notes at the initial closing, with the balance issued in two tranches of $11.0 million and $6.25 million. The Company used the net proceeds from this offering to continue its commercialization efforts for vBloc® Neurometabolic Therapy, clinical and product development activities, and for other working capital and general corporate purposes.",14
16-12-23,5ju5wl,"What Are Investor's Seeing in This Cannabis Stock I'm Not?","A couple months ago I heard a rumor about a company that investors were flocking to despite slowing user growth. I didn’t know it then, but that comment would send me down a rabbit hole. Days later I did some basic research on the company, MassRoots. I read through the company’s SEC filings and found some news articles. I learned that MassRoots is a Facebook or Yelp for Cannabis enthusiasts. With a few basic figures I did some back of napkin calculations. That’s when my jaw dropped and images of Michael Lewis’ The Big Short entered my head. 

As someone who worked in tech and started a profitable tech company, I understand that it's commonplace to value company’s based on their ability to eventually make revenue and profit (not necessarily their earnings at present). That was the case with Facebook and Instagram, and it has been the case for many others. But still, when I saw MassRoots figures I couldn’t believe my eyes. 

Today MassRoots is worth $60,000,000. They are on track to make $1,000,000 in revenue in 2016, which puts their valuation at 60 times revenue (keep in mind, the S&amp;P 500 average is $17x profit). They have just over 900,000 users of their app and in the last 6 months they’ve seen 1-2% user growth. They’ve burned $773,467 every month for the last four quarters with 20-35 employees (roughly 2-3x the average in tech). 

At some point I started asking a new question: what do the 11,000 MassRoots shareholders see that I don’t?

16-12-22,5jqtqk,ERII - Energy Recovery Inc.,"I have been following this company for a while and have a small position (170 shares). Their products are pressure exchangers and heat recovery devices. The main markets they target are water desalination and fracking, with fracking expected to be their main source of growth. 

The stock took a hit at the end of October when they announced that they would not be able to deliver their vorteq missile techonology on time due to engineering difficulties. This is also important because they signed a 15 year contract with Schlumberger, giving them exclusive rights to the technology.  It has been gradually increasing in price since, somewhat correlated with the increase in the price of oil. 

The way I see it, this is a potential yolo opportunity based on; 1) whether they deliver on the Vorteq next year and 2) the price of oil making fracking profitable again.With Ichan in government though, fracking is unlikely to face any regulatory hurdles so that is a potential positive. 

In terms of fundamentals, revenues were positive the last quarter; and have grown 10% from the previous. Earnings per share are barely positive (0.01) but expected to be up to 0.30/share by next December, assuming ERII delivers, if not; they're fucked.

16-12-22,5jqwcb,Wrote down a random thought about investing.,"A trader entering a market with no prior experience, knowledge or discretionary biases has an equal chance of being right as they do being wrong. This idea was made popular in 1973 by Burton G. Malkiel, an economics professor at Princeton University and it has been coined the ‘Random Walk Theory’.

I believe this theory to be true, I also believe markets trend up and down over different timeframes. Unlike Malkiel who believes, it’s best to buy and hold over the long run. I believe that if a trader enters a position in the direction of the prevalent trend, then that trader has an increased chance of his position being profitable for an unknowable amount of time while that position is open. Trending markets can be seen by adding the 200-day EMA to any market chart. If this is true, then what percentage is that? And, how can a trader control their risk by managing their open trades? 

We can back test these questions using past market data, but past results don’t predict future profits, and it defeats the opening statement. For this experiment to work properly it needs to be front tested. There is also an issue in front testing this strategy, it doesn’t mean that the results from doing so can be used to predict the future either. If this is true then the opening statement must be true and flipping a coin and entering a trade can be just as profitable as trading with the trend. 

Conclusion: Managing risk is much more important than stock selection.

16-12-23,5juofw,A Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Background Check,"-
Reports of privatizing the government-sponsored mortgage-finance giants are greatly exaggerated.
-

President-elect Trump’s nominee for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said on Wednesday that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should be “privatized.” This comment sent their share prices soaring, as investors speculated that the two firms will be allowed to recapitalize and return to the mortgage markets as the dominant players they once were.

This outcome is highly unlikely, as a little history shows, and that’s why Mr. Mnuchin’s comment was probably misinterpreted by investors.

As originally conceived during the New Deal, Fannie Mae was a government agency that would borrow funds in the credit markets and buy mortgages from banks and other originators. The idea was that this would provide a secondary market for mortgages, giving lenders the cash to make more loans.

As a government agency, however, Fannie Mae was on-budget and its expenditures added to the deficit during the Vietnam War.

In 1968, accordingly, Fannie Mae was given a congressional charter as a corporation and allowed to sell shares to the public. This permitted the Johnson administration to argue successfully that Fannie should be excluded from the budget. But it also raised questions about whether Fannie could operate profitably without government backing.

As a buyer of mortgages, Fannie could only be profitable if its cost of funds was substantially lower than the mortgages themselves.

The Johnson administration tried to solve this problem by giving Fannie sufficient connections to the government so that, even as a private shareholder-owned firm, it would still be treated by the credit markets as though it was government-backed.

Thus Fannie was blessed with many special connections to the government, including a line of credit at the Treasury, a government “mission” and the appointment of some of its directors by the president. This signaled the markets that it was still implicitly government supported without the explicit guarantee that would put it back on the budget.

The idea worked. The market believed—despite legislative language that stated otherwise—that the government would in fact stand behind Fannie. And when Freddie Mac was given an identical government charter in 1970, creditors were willing to lend to both firms at rates that were close to the Treasury’s own favorable rate. Indeed, they were called “the agencies” by the market, which signaled something government-like.

All this makes clear why Fannie and Freddie cannot be privatized and returned to the markets in the form they were before their 2008 insolvency. The fiction that Fannie and Freddie weren’t government-guaranteed has now been exposed. The markets now know for sure that if the two fail again they will be rescued by the government. If there is any honesty in budgetary accounting, their borrowings will have to be treated as government debt and added to the deficit.

It is unlikely that the Trump administration or Secretary Mnuchin will be happy to add several trillion dollars in debt to the already bloated U.S. debt load. On the other hand, Fannie and Freddie clearly cannot act profitably as secondary mortgage-market players—buying mortgages from banks and others—unless they have a lower cost of funds than the mortgages they will buy.

That might be possible with the capital levels that support a triple-A rating, but even the Johnson administration realized that this wouldn’t work. Capital levels that high probably cannot be achieved or sustained without promising investors levels of profitability that are unavailable to mortgage-market participants.

Thus, there is only one alternative if Fannie and Freddie are to be “privatized” and still expected to act as secondary market players. As truly private firms, without triple-A ratings, they will able to securitize mortgages through the structured transactions that many banks and others used before the mortgage meltdown in 2008. This is a viable and important business, and needs to be restored, but its capital requirements are modest and there will be many competitors.

Most certainly, they won’t have the financial advantages that allowed them to dominate the housing finance market before 2008. Nor will they earn the profits that are exciting the speculators who—on the strength of Mr. Mnuchin’s statement—have been bidding up their shares.

Mr. Wallison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, is the author of “Hidden In Plain Sight: What Really Caused the World’s Worst Financial Crisis and Why It Could Happen Again” (Encounter Books, 2015).

2) Empirically, small caps have lead after a prolonged large cap run. 

 
3) All things equal, smaller banks will benefits from reduced regulations than larger banks. (Shit's expensive)


4) Focusing on a banks primary product: Loaning money. Some housing markets are doing better than others, more loans for higher dollar values bode well for banks.

16-12-22,5jri1v,For the 99% of us...,"Be careful of trading in the months of December and January if you expect to deduct your trading losses on your 2016 Taxes. 
  
**This is mostly relevant to any trades you've made this month AND expect to make through February 1st.**

*Wash Sales will make it illegal to deduct any trading losses on your 2016 taxes. You made gains? No worries you get the honor of paying the government for your success!*
  
   
  
  
## So what is this I am talking about????
Check what you've traded since December 1st and keep track what day you made the closing trade (for a loss). You *WILL NOT* be able to repurchase that stock (or similar etf, equity, trading instrument... etc) in 2017 *IF* 30 days have not passed since you realized the loss only if you expect to deduct the loss on your taxes for 2016. This is across all brokerage accounts meaning you can't sell in broker A and repurchase on broker B. 

Uncle Sam will find you. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
  
   
  
  
## Why?
Well it's to stop people who have unrealized losses who still want to baghold but who want to  have the benefit of deducting the loss on the current year taxes. So you realize your loss in the current tax year and then repurchase shortly after creating a ""new"" position that you can continue to bag hold for unrealized loss/gains. Uncle Sam, IRS or whatever says no to that and you are not qualified to include that loss on your tax return.

The risk with REITs is that if the housing market crashes again, the REIT stocks will crash. But that risk can be limited with a Trailing Stop Loss. If times are good, my REIT continues to pay and goes up. If there is a crash, I limit my losses and I'm not stuck with a devaluing empty house looking for renters or buyers.


What do you all think of Real Estate vs REITs? Am I missing an unknown risk here?


Also, I am only comparing this to buying Real Estate with the intent to flip or rent. Not comparing this to buying a house and living in it for the rest of your life.


TLDR: Put 100k in REIT with trailing stop loss = limited risk with high up side.",2

What should I do?,"As title says, I currently have ~$100k sitting in a 0.3% interest savings account which is paining me due to obvious lack of growth.  My wife and I are debt free other than a 15-year mortgage ($2,500/mo) and are already maxing out our 401(k)s and IRAs.

I want to get this money into the market, but I'm scared with how long we've been in the bull market and would hate to dump it in and then immediately face a downturn and lose a lot of money.  However, the longer I wait, the more gains I could possibly be missing.

I assume my best bet is to enter it in chunks to spread my risk, but how much over how long, I have no idea.  Any suggestions?

edit: Wow! I appreciate all the responses.  A bit more information about us... We live in Ohio making roughly $160k combined annually.  $300k 15-year mortgage @ $2,500/mo.  The reason we have so much money in cash is because we were going to save it for a home down payment, but ended up using the VA Home Loan upon returning from a deployment for no money down.  Not actually as risk averse as it may have sounded in my initial post.  Currently both of us are maxing retirement accounts in Target Date Funds.  I'm not including our already saved up emergency fund in the amount to invest, so I'd dump it all in the market.

I think I will end up breaking it into four chunks and DCA into some semi-aggressive funds.  Anything is better than 0.3%

16-12-23,5jyjp5,Why is Cameco (top uranium producer) not moving higher?,"It's my understanding that one of the biggest threats to this Uranium miner is nuclear deproliferation. When nukes are decommissioned the fissile material is sold to power plants, displacing mined uranium and driving prices down. Currently this accounts for [13-19% of reactor fuel](http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/military-warheads-as-a-source-of-nuclear-fuel.aspx).

Given Trumps tweet about re escalating the arms race I would have expected the price of Cameco, the world's top uranium producer, to have risen. Indeed there was a small bump yesterday, but it looks like the rally fizzled out. 

I'm wondering if my assumptions about nuclear proliferation and the price of uranium are wrong or the markets stopped caring about the president elect's tweets.

Every once and a while I consider buying Cameco as a contrarian play and if you look at their stock it does seem to perform better under Republican administrations, but I would like to understand more about the dynamics of Uranium pricing before I take the risk.",6

16-12-23,5jvexi,"Bitcoin and GBTC, presenting my thoughts.","I've been trading bitcoin and GBTC since early 2015, since then the value of bitcoin has become 3.5X, but through leveraged trading I've made my investment 8X, so I've been a relatively successful trader (although back when I started inexperienced, I lost 1/4 of my stash initially). So I feel I've gained some skills into trading this market, and here I'll try to concisely present some of my thoughts on GBTC, but I'll be happy to expand on different topics related to bitcoin if anyone has questions.    

&amp;nbsp;

 

""GBTC"" is the FINRA-assigned symbol for shares of the Bitcoin Investment Fund (BIT), created in Sep/2013 by SecondMarket and (now) administered by Greyscale. 
Each BIT share represents 0.1 BTC stored by Greyscale (which presently holds ~138 kBTC).

&amp;nbsp;


**BIT shares older than 12 months** can be traded independent through registered brokers, under the symbol GBTC.

&amp;nbsp;



B/C of its tax, security, regulatory advantages, since inception GBTC has always had a premium to bitcoin price which normally has ranged between 20% to 100% ($144 when bitcoin price reached $770 during the summer). The last two times that bitcoin has risen (during 4th quarter of 2015, and 2nd quarter of 2016), premium of GBTC reached a maximum of 95% and 100% respectively. Both instances the premium took a short time to catch up. At the moment premium sits at about 20% which I suspect soon will become much higher. I recommend buying GBTC up to 40% premium (I find it to be average premium across time), any more than that it may not be a good deal, but b/c of a relatively illiquid market the premiums historically have increased to 100% at which point I recommend an exit and finding a better entry.

&amp;nbsp;



I’d be happy to answer any questions regarding bitcoin and GBTC to the extend that I can.

&amp;nbsp;



Disclosure: I’m long on bitcoin and GBTC.

16-12-23,5jvu80,What to do with my NVDA stock?,"I'm new to investing and I had a good friend (and more experienced trader than I) tell me that he considers holding stock for anything less than a year to be gambling, so I bought a stock with the intention of listening to his advice. I bought NVDA at $60 in September and it closed today at $107, up 78%...When I bought it, I had planned to hold it for a year or so and then sell it. At that time though my thought process was ""I hope I'm not getting in too late because it has already grown a lot in the past year, but it's a good company in a good industry, so hopefully it'll be between $70 and $80 next year and I can save 10% of my gains by holding it for one year""...Obviously it has obliterated my expectations and now I'm conflicted as to whether or not I should stick to my original intention (hold for a year) or take the money and run. If I ran, it would be on Jan 2 (avoid counting it against 2016 taxes) or if the stock hit 100.00 or less next week...Am I doing this wrong?  Should I instead set goals of gains (5% and sell, 10% and sell, etc) without care for the length of holding? Should I instead be flexible (goals for holding period and gains) and play things by ear?  I read [this article](http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/12/22/2016/long-intc-or-nvda-heres-how-get-protection) today that says that ""short investors should stop loss at $93 and long investors should stop loss at $69"" but how short is ""short term"" and how long is ""long term"" in this article? I have no intention of holding it for 5 years.

I think it's funny that had I played the ""run"" card on Nov 11th I'd have missed out on $20/share of gain...up until today I had been firmly in the ""hold for a year or so"" camp which got me that extra $20/share, but this just seems too good to be true, like why would the stock price just keep soaring?  Soaring after an earnings report or huge deal announcement is one thing, but it seems to me that the company is soaring based on high expectations, which (as an amateur investor) says to me that if it only ""meets expectations"" (0.83 EPS) on it's earnings report that it's value will plummet. I feel like I might be behaving like a naive fool for clinging to this ""hold for a year"" mentality, but, then again, listening to it a month ago has resulted in me getting 33% more gains; devil on one shoulder, angel on the other, and no past experiences (or knowledge) to indicate whom is wiser. Any advice is welcome.


Background that may help with advice: at this point in my life (24 and single) I have no intention of building a long-term portfolio and instead intend to play with a little of my money to get a feel for how it all works before my money matters (i.e. family and whatnot). My reason for getting into stocks was to simply make sure my saved money keeps up with inflation (as opposed to rotting away in a savings account), therefore most of my money (my ""long term"" money) is in an S&amp;P ETF where it is accomplishing this goal.

16-12-23,5jwf68,MPET? Up over 600% since their strategic merger,"Starting in August Mpet made a strategic merger with Tellurian to develop Liquified Natural Gas(LNG). Now for some reason LNG is being thought of as the next big thing in the oil industry. 

I believe this is a reverse merger since Tellurian will control 93% of mpet after this. So it should be the same as if Tellurian itself is going on the market.

Since then GE has invested 25 million with Tellurian on this project and Total(another company) made a 207 million investment with Tellurian. To me these seem to be huge amounts of money to be throwing around. But also looking around other companies in the oil industry also throw around equally large amounts of money as investment.


I'm not sure what else to look up besides recent news, but I wonder is this a good investment? Or is this some sort of scheme where I can lose my money. I'm not too knowledgeable about oil companies.",7

16-12-23,5jwg2y,Is there a single low-cost ETF that could function as a complete portfolio?,"So I've heard that diversification is a good thing, and that I should have exposure to stocks, bonds, and REITs, both in the US and internationally. So instead of combining 5 or 6 different ETFs, is there just a single ticker that has very low fees, and very high diversification across many different asset classes and regions?

I don't know what I'm doing, or why I would want to put 10% into emerging markets, versus 15% into small-cap value stocks. Why not 11% and 14%?

Surely these funds have access to some advanced formulas that can maximize Sharpe ratio. If I'm going to take advice about which ETFs to buy, I don't feel comfortable having control over the weightings. ""Just throw in 10% of this one and 15% of this one, it's just a rule of thumb"". That doesn't give me a lot of confidence. I'd rather just buy one ETF that does it all for me, and has good reasons behind their weightings. If it's left up to me, I'm probably going to panic sell when one of the components starts crashing, and then my weightings will be completely random.

Everyone I read is telling me that I need to buy 4-7 different ETFs in order to have a balanced portfolio, so does that just exist as a single ETF?

Does Vanguard offer something like this?

EDIT: Ok, I found it. [Vanguard Target Retirement funds](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/target-retirement/#/). ""Get a complete portfolio in a single fund"".

Pick your retirement date, buy the corresponding ticker, and that's it. They have different tickers for different 5-year intervals, and they automatically get more conservative as you approach retirement. They're also automatically rebalanced. I think this is the perfect way to take emotion out of the equation, and to stop yourself from trying to time the market.

Are there any downsides? For example, do you save any money in fees if you build your own portfolio and rebalance it manually?",79

16-12-23,5jzxr8,TSLA stock finally closes above $210 for the first time in 4 months,"The downtrend has officially finished. Price target should now be $240~$280. The stock can potentially go higher with Model 3 launch in H2 2017. $350 doesn't look too far-fetched if the release goes according to plan. However, my estimate is still $280ish by end of 2017 because I think it's better to be conservative. 

People should stop thinking: ""Tesla is overpriced"". It is overpriced if you compare it to other auto companies like GM. But it is arguable whether Tesla should be compared to the likes of GM, Ford and Toyota. Tesla is a premium auto company, even though they're going to release the Model 3 which is meant for the mainstream. It will still be a premium car with premium features. 

Also, Tesla is more than just an auto company, it is an energy storage company and solar company. It may be better to compare Tesla to Samsung or Hitachi, rather than comparing them to auto companies. 

Tesla is growing exponentially, unlike GM or Ford which have already reached maturity and have limited growth opportunities due to overhead. 

I am very excited for the next auto revolution.

**EDIT** It's funny how everyone is trying to down-vote my comments. If you don't agree with my thesis, you don't have to. However, don't blame me if you miss out on $$$$$ when you didn't buy at this price. Because once it goes to $240, it is likely that we won't see $200~$210 levels for a long long time. 

**EDIT 2** You guys are funny. It seems like no one actually knows how to trade the markets and are purely basing their opinions on P/E ratios, balance sheets, etc. Since when were the markets rational? Especially for stocks like TSLA, AMZN and a whole lot of other tech stocks, the effect of the balance sheet on the company's stock is minimal and un-substantial at best. TSLA is an overvalued stock with huge growth prospects because of its unique product line and rapid expansion. Trading is a charting game. If you are a professional trader, you would have bought TSLA at $200ish and will keep it at least to $240. 

**EDIT 3** Context is important. Elon Musk is now one of Trump's policy advisers. Trump can't deny that the future of US industries can't rely on fossil fuels forever. In order for the US economy to compete and be ahead of everyone else, they have to enable high-tech companies like Tesla to grow. These will be reflected by Trump's new policies. He is always changing his policies, so don't expect his pro-fossil-fuel stance to influence the market in the long term. Just look at how Trump's recent tweets have sent offshore drilling stocks plummeting/ceasing their bull runs.

Also looking back I know people who lost money on Marijuana! Can you believe it? I still respect them more than the people who didn't open their TFSA after they were told of the momentum building in that sector.

I entered a new income bracket and have hired an accountant to defer some taxes. I think I rather like living on margin. Less taxes more appreciation for the finer things in life.

Next time you sit down for a sports game take a note of the number of TV commercials hawking gas guzzling pickup trucks.  Advertising for the automotive industry must be in the tens of billions of dollars.  So, it is safe to say that Ford is paying billions of dollars to advertise their best in class cars (but mostly trucks).  What is their advertising budget on whatever electric vehicle they reluctantly developed?  I haven't seen a commercial for one yet.   Also, why don't they mention that, right now, in this world, it is approximately 50% cheaper to drive an electric vehicle than it is to drive an equivalent internal compustion engine vehicle (once the vehicle is purchased)?  On the other hand, if I'm not mistaken, Tesla doesn't have a TV advertising budget.  Their cars cost 50% + *less* to drive once the car is purchased.

16-12-24,5k0jam,Actively Managed Fund vs Index Fund (same management fees),"Hello r/investing,

I was not able to find your ""Daily advice thread"" and tried looking into the hot posts and saw some people asking for advice, so I'll just post this if I posted it in a wrong section, I'm really sorry.

Okay, my situation is that the **actively managed funds** here (in the Philippines) ***costs the same*** as **passively managed index funds** - 1.0% ~ 1.5%.

I was not able to get resource about UITF's here, but here in the Philippines we have Mutual Funds, UITF and ETF from a Stock Broker - [a link to the comparison](http://fitzvillafuerte.com/mutual-funds-and-unit-investment-trust-funds-whats-the-difference.html).

I was thinking of investing regularly (monthly) which counts ETF out, it has no management fees at all or really low but I think the 0.25% commission + other fees would definitely not be good in the long run for my end.

Now, my question would be, is it better to just put my money on actively managed fund because it costs the same as a passively managed fund? Or would it still be better to go with the index fund compared to buying equities?

A list of index funds and equities here:

* UITF - [BPI High Dividend Fund](https://www.bpiassetmanagement.com/pages/bpi-philippine-high-dividend-equity-fund) (currently invested here)
* UITF - [BDO Equity Fund](https://www.bdo.com.ph/personal/trust-and-investments/peso-denominated-uitfs/bdo-equity-fund)
* UITF - [BDO Equity Index Fund](https://www.bdo.com.ph/personal/trust-and-investments/peso-denominated-uitfs/bdo-equity-index-fund)
* UITF - [BPI Philippine Equity Index Fund](https://www.bpiassetmanagement.com/pages/bpi-philippine-equity-index-fund)
* MF - [ALFM Growth Fund]
(https://www.alfmmutualfunds.com/mutual_fund#growth_fund)
* MF - [ALFM Philippine Stock Index Fund](https://www.alfmmutualfunds.com/mutual_fund#phil_stock_fund)
* MF - [Sun Life Philippine Stock Index Fund](https://www.sunlife.com.ph/philippines/Products+and+Services/Mutual+funds/Sun+Life+Prosperity+Funds/Philippine+Stock+Index+Fund?vgnLocale=en_CA)

They're all priced the same, with the lowest costing around 1.0% management fee and highest 1.5%. I'm currently invested on BPI as that's the most convenient way to invest (my checkings/savings are there).

Is it just expected that after the dividend is paid that the stock price will go back up? Or is there something that I am missing.

Take a look and form an opinion. 

Link to my article/report: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/short-case-tesla-motors-michael-gifford

My opinion is that TSLA is significantly overpriced and bears a risk of bankruptcy. A related opinion of mine is that TSLA arrived at its current range as a result of people investing in 'the future' via Elon's salesmanship and track record. Tesla can make it over the long term if it it can deliver the Model 3 then follow a more sustainable business model.

As a part of the benefit pact my company has with the bank, I'm entitled to take a loan of around 40,000k$, with interest rate of 1% yearly over 84 payment installments.

I can afford the returns, it would be roughly 15-20% of my net salary.

Question is, should I invest money that isn't mine, and if so, what are the recommended channels to do so? I thought about investing it in some index fund, probably S&amp;P500 or something a like. ",1

Back in the day you could see on Level II where the big blocks were landing, until they changed the Time &amp; Sales to only report how those blocks are broken up. But if you use a chart of volume bars, you can still see where the big blocks are landing

I use charts where each bar is 50 S&amp;P E-mini contracts. If someone drops 500 contracts, is it 1.) immediately apparent that is was a single block, and 2.) you can see how it was filled. These two points are really what we all want to know from the charts. Nothing else really matters. It is the foot prints of the big boys that we follow because they are the ones who move the market.

So I think volume bars *by themselves* are a better *predicator* than any other tool we have available.

16-12-25,5k7srk,"[DD] Merry Christmas, here's some DD","When I was only 3 years old, my mother told me that I shouldn't play with wires, lest I be shocked. She never did explain to me what being shocked meant, and what it felt like, and I was always left wondering. When I was 8, I learned from my teacher that metal conducted electricity. I could no longer quench my thirst for knowledge. I stole one of my sister's sewing needles and stuck it in the TV outlet, and I instantly felt a pulse along my arm. It was not painful, it did not burn. In a way, it was interesting, even a tad pleasant.

When I was 11, my best friend told me that if you rubbed your penis, you would feel really really good after a minute. And he was right. Now I wondered though--what if I could feel the pulse of electricity at the same time? So I took two needles, laced them around each other, one on my penis and the other in the outlet, and felt like I never had before. I did this every few hours, every day.

My mom thought I had a problem. She replaced our silverware with plastic. She made my sister stop sewing. I was given ""counseling"" from a therapist who was wrong in every way. But I needed that feeling, it was just so appealing. There was nothing wrong with me! He therapist reccomended that my family go on a vacation where I could get away from my 'problem.'

It was the first night out camping, no metal in sight, no electricity either. Then I realized that my brother had packed a portable camping light. It was hot, but it shone just as any other would. What my family didn't know is that I had snuck a sewing needle into my hair for the trip.

I took the needle out and jabbed at the lamp. Just gently poking the needle with my fingers, I felt hot and tingly. This would be better than anything else. I caressed the lamp, took it into my arms, and held it above my groin. It throttled down the shaft and up the head, going deep into my core. I could not help but both laugh and cry. I was in heaven. I had discovered what lamps could really do.

I made a fair bit of noise doing all that. My mom came storming into my tent, and I was a mess. I was still coming off of pure ecstasy, so in truth I was not embarrassed. I was really sore, and it still tingled, so even with my mom in the room and pants still down I couldn’t help but giggle. She was furious, and grabbed the lamp, careful to avoid my cum.

She told my dad too, who beat the living shit out of me. I broke down in tears, how could the worst pain follow my perfect heaven? We went back to my therapist's office immediately. My therapist wasn’t happy either. I can’t remember what he said, but he was very dissapointed. When we got home, my dad locked me in my room for what felt like weeks.

There was a light in my room, but my parents shut off electricity to my room. I felt empty, and cold. Still, there was a lamp right there, if only I could turn it on. Of course, I knew everything about electricity. I had embraced it as my friend, and I knew all of her secrets. It wasn’t long before I was thinking of a way to return. I scoured my entire room, but found little more than loose pocket change and lint. I no longer had any of my electronics.

I waited a long time, I can’t even tell you when, but I told my parents through the door that I was thirsty. I cried and cried, begged them for something other than stale water to drink. I knew that we only ever had three things in this house beside water, and I wasn’t about to be given my dad’s vodka.  They would not give me a real drink though, only an old lemon, which smelled already of the beginnings of decay.

My stomach gurgled, vibrating almost enough to be arousing in itself, had I been more awake. I fell asleep, and woke barely better than I had before. I had even caught a cold. Mucus drained from my noise as my illness got worse, but I didn’t care. In my ill stupor, I began to daydream, for what felt nearly as long as my entire life. I had it. I had it!!

I pried an old nail out of my door, and jammed it into the lemon. I took a penny from my old search and jammed that into the other end of the lemon. I rested the base of my penis on the tip of the nail, and made the penny my pedestal. I was the wire, and the lemon was the lamp. I once again felt it coursing through me, reassuring me that I would be alright no matter what the punishment. My prostate groaned almost as loud as my stomach, and I could not stand. I let the current run through me, tensing my thighs and clenching my anus. I exploded all over, from the door, to every wall, to my nose. My fluids formed a frothy mixture of white and yellow over my neck and breast. If lamps were heaven, then lemons were God himself.",0

16-12-25,5k8bmt,"I'm a young first-time investor - are Unit Trust funds a good place to start?","First-off, I'm from APAC, not the US. 

My first ever investing experience was when I put a certain amount of money last year December in an FD account, and it just matured a few days ago. It was 4.3% for 1 year with a current board rate of 3.1%, so I think it was a decent investment. 

Now I want to go further. I have just finished college, have no debt (thanks to scholarships), am about to enter the workforce and want to invest the principal+interest from my FD account (for a start). 

Would investing in Unit Trust funds be a good place to start? Or are there better avenues? 

I am thinking of investing in a portfolio of UT funds focusing on equities. I understand the risk is the highest with equity UT funds, but this money that I have available for investing purposes can be set aside for the long term with no issue. And more than that, I want to get my feet wet and understand basic investing principles (such as regional and sectorial market trends) so that when the time comes in a few years time (i.e. when there is a local/global/regional recession) I will have enough know-how to make money when the rest of the market tanks. 

I am planning to buy equity-based UT funds with different focus areas respectively (no USA at the moment):

- Asia Pacific/Asia (ex Japan)

- Greater China

- Europe

- Local (small cap and regular)

I'm also planning on getting one balanced Asian-based UT fund that's about 60% equity and 40% fixed income securities so that I am able to understand how differently balanced UT funds perform relative to equity UT funds. 

Another thing I have been considering is buying from fund houses that also offer fixed income UT funds or money market UT funds (or even simply ""balanced"" UT funds) as alternatives. This is so that in the event of an imminent recession I am able to switch from the equity UT funds which will likely make huge losses during such a period to safer alternatives without having to pay any kind of fees. 

I'm looking to get annualized returns of around 8-10% across the board over a 5 year period, but will settle at even 6% which itself is already almost twice the board rate for FDs. I fully understand that UT funds can go up and down in the short term and am not bothered by that. I'm looking at the medium to long term for sure. 

Given the above, is my strategy with regards to UT funds sound? More than that, is this a good or at least decent place to start off investing, or are there better alternatives? (PS: Assuming I do not have the time to actively invest directly into the stock market)",4

Twas the night before Christmas,

not a trader was trading,

The stocks that I purchased,

In hopes that a good trade,

When outside my window,  
I heard a great sound!  
I prayed those SEC dicks,  
were nowhere to be found.  


I sprang from my bed,  
grabbed my gun, and walked slow,  
to see what was up.  
(This pissed off my ho).  


I could scarcely believe,  
what my eyes were seeing!  
It was a huge space yacht!  
I thought, ""I must be dreaming!""  


""I've always wanted one,  
to piss off my haters!  
And look!,"" I said,  
""It's pulled by eight traders!""  


Two teams of four traders,  
pulled the yacht through the sky.  
Then I noticed the driver,  
with a twinkle in his eye.  


His eyes were glazed over,  
his legs shook like jelly,  
and his 5 o'clock shadow,  
told me, it's Martin Shkreli!  


The yacht stopped at my penthouse,  
it was facing the train.  
St. Martin stood up,  
and called his traders by name.  


""On Madoff! On Friehling!  
On Lay and Skilling!  
On Belfort! On Fuld!  
On Lippmann and Keating!""  


""Pull to the window,  
I see and good boy,  
who's made the nice list!  
Let's give him some toys!""  


When under my tree,  
more presents appeared!  
My stocking was full!  
My hos shook in fear.  


I looked in his bag,  
and asked, ""What's the coal for?""  
""That's for Loretta Lynch,"" he said,  
""And Eric Holder.""  


""But you're a good trader,  
your gains my be slight,  
but you're yoloing the market,  
so I visit tonight.""  


""Christmas is about giving,  
about joy, love, and cheer,  
so fuck the SEC!  
And keep trading! Don't fear!""  


His yacht pulled away,  
my hos, they returned,  
but St. Martin was gone.  
He was not to be heard.  


But I heard him exclaim,  
as his yacht shone in the snow,

Is there any downfall in purchasing the corresponding ETF to an index fund instead of the fund itself?

16-12-25,5k6x7h,January 2017 - Tax loss selling and potential to cause market correction?,"I am NOT calling for a market crash, so please don't think that I am trolling. 

Tax loss selling is when individuals, funds and companies sell off their shares in order to decrease their realized capital gains throughout the year and thereby decreasing capital gains tax payable. Prior to the tax code change by President-elect Trump, tax loss selling usually occurred on the last trading day of December. It mostly effects stocks that have been beaten down. 

Because of President-elect Trump's change to the tax code, there is some speculation that we might be in for a market sell-off in January 2017. 

Please discuss your insights on when you expect tax loss selling to happen and what effects that you expect. ",12

&gt; ... that overhaul includes a big cut in the tax rate, from 35 percent to 20 percent. But it also includes some huge changes in the way the corporate tax works, apart from its overall level. They want to push companies away from financing projects with debt, by making it impossible for them to deduct interest payments on loans. They want to add breaks for companies making big capital investments (like buying equipment or building factories), making those totally deductible in the year they’re made rather than “depreciable” over time.
&gt;
&gt; **But perhaps most dramatically of all, they want to allow companies to totally exclude revenue from exports when calculating their tax burden, and to ban them from deducting the cost of imports they purchase.**

Companies like Walmart, Best Buy, Target, and Walgreens are concerned these changes may dramatically wipe out their profits.",406

I'm Brazilian I was toying with Google Trend today to find out if we could some kind of pattern that show that people bought less in this Christmas than last year. But one graph that grabbed my attention was xvideos search against ""Tesouro Direto"" (Tesouro Direto is a government platform to small investor to buy and sell sovereign bonds).


I'm not trying to make any kind of joke here, I usually compare my searches to famous porn sites to see if they are relevant at all or some kind of niche search that no one uses, and in December Tesouro Direto just passed xvideos.
For a long time, in Latin America we had one of the lowest saving rate, and Brazil crisis can be a start a new trend in this area, since people are expecting some changes in public welfare and government expending. So, I'm trying to transform this in an investing idea. In you opinion what kind of investment is a good medium-long term when the country is saving more?


At the top of my head I thought financial company, like brokers and stock exchanges. Maybe some form of real state, but not sure if it will be a good timing for that since we have 6% real interest rates and some years of low growth ahead. Fixed-income instruments for sure are a good option since I don't think this momentum will go away.

I also started a small supplemental 457 account thru work that I play with a little. I mean I use what littlle knowledge I have and move it around a bit. I needed to borrow against it a few years back when the wife had some medical issues. There's 12k in it with 3k left to pay back in the next 2 years. Mostly safe to moderate risk funds in there. I plan on retiring in 5-7 years. Planning on selling my big house in 2 years and should do ok on that sale. Now with that foundation set, here's my question.
I opened a trade account with 1 thousand dollars, that I COULD afford to lose. I want to start taking some chances with it. I'm so lucky in that I'm surrounded by family an friends that are geniuses. I mean, how could I go wrong with their advise, what, with all there experience and intelligence. But lets say I put that aside for now. My instinct is to go mostly with weed stocks. But when I started looking, I got real afraid, to say the least. I still would like to be in that sector, but should I take a chance with the pink slip shares in bulk...or go with established companies in that area like SMG...or something in between.
I'm not too smart, but I can learn and am willing to put the research time in. As far as my goals,1) to make enough money to give my wife all that she deserves for putting up with me for 30 plus years. 2) Enjoy my three grandkids more and buy them even more shit that I do now. And 3) do some traveling before I die.

Any wisdom would be appreciated.

Safe, happy and prosperous holiday and new year to all.

16-12-26,5kf065,Benefits of a TLH on a relatively large taxable account?,"Apologies if this has been asked before — my brief searches haven't turned anything up that's directly relevant.

I have ~$200k sitting in a taxable Wealthfront account and am trying to understand how to think about the benefits of tax-loss harvesting. With an account of this size, Wealthfront's TLH is harvesting well over $3k of losses per year for me.

I totally understand the benefits of TLH up to $3k — I can offset ordinary income, which results in a significant tax savings. On the other hand, above $3k I can only offset capital gains, but because I'm relatively early in my career I don't intend to sell anything in my portfolio (and therefore take gains) anytime soon.

I know that the losses can carry over between years, but I'm having trouble seeing how that'd benefit me. Let's say I buy $1000 of stock and TLH when it drops to $500, reaping a $500 capital loss. If 10 years later I sell at $1500, I'll only get taxed on $500 of that gain...but that's exactly what I would've been taxed on if I hadn't done anything.

Am I missing something? Is there a strategy I should be taking to make use of these losses?

Thanks!

edit: Bah, extranneous but un-editable ""a"" in title.

edit 2: Because both commenters so far have talked about the order of operations being gains getting offset before income: totally understood. But in this case my question specifically arises because I don't have any realized gains, so I fall through to offset income immediately. I get how that's beneficial up to $3k, but don't understand the benefit above that in a world where I'm continuing to not realize gains.",0

I'm interested in finding a good commission structure for a fairly small account. I'm paying 75 cents per contract until the end of 2016 (at which juncture I will have to call my broker) and have paid around $1100 in commission since Halloween. 


What rates do you pay and how much would you estimate that you've paid in commission YTD? I'm considering switching to IB but am not a huge fan of TWS (and they don't give margin accounts to clients under 21). ",1

16-12-27,5kk4d6,Due Diligence on Why Oil Stocks will Rise throughout 2017,"I've been watching Oil Futures for a while and am now confident that Oil stocks will begin their upwards reversal due to numerous reasons.

* OPEC (and non-OPEC countries) recently got a deal done reducing Oil supply. Lower Supply + Higher Demand = $$$
* /CL (Crude Oil) has easily surpassed the $52.00 resistance with force. Oil is a solid long to $60 (minimum) within the next couple of months. I wouldn't be surprised if Oil reaches the mid $70s.
* Recent Election of Donald Trump. Oil Longs have just hit the jackpot. He's appointed Rex Tillerson, former Exxon CEO, as hit Secretary of State. He's also appointed three fromer Goldman Sachs employees and multiple billionaires to his cabinet. 
* /CL has strong support at $50. It shot off of the support after the Rate Hike was announced. The lowest Crude Futures dropped to was $49.95. It's bounced right back up to $53.61 at the time that I'm writing this. 

Stocks I recommend to watch:

* USO (Price Target: $20+ by March LEAST RISK)
* RIG (Price Target: $30+ by March MEDIUM RISK)
* AXAS (Price Target: $3.85 HIGH RISK)
* /CL (Just watch Crude Futures)

So my question is:

What is the best route to take so I can legally invest while in the US given my current status? My current plan is to get an on campus job which will land me a social security number, then sign up online with a brokerage account. However, there could be better options and I don't want to jeopardize my legal status as an international student.

Eventually we will come to our senses and realize the market is about to close so we will place market orders for stocks that already had huge runs. Half of those in attendance will get scared and sell on the next dip while also earning a PDT designation on their Robinhood accounts. Next, someone will find 0% balance transfer checks on the backseat of their 1997 Toyota Camry that they borrowed from their Grandma. We will cash them at the nearest Casino and successfully deposit them to an overseas broker dealing in CFDs to make a large sum of profit but will be unable to withdraw due to our residency. We'll then use the rest of our credit limit on our credit cards to hit the town and buy drinks for unattractive girls in clubs with bottle service and huge cover charges.

Anyone know of any good resources to understand how to pick the various options (puts nad calls)?  

Some specific questions:

1.  I am a little confused about some of the options, because the prices are so much lower than the actual stock price.  Does this mean that if I am in the money, I will then be able to sell my stocks for the actual stock price, hence increasing my investment by 5-10 fold?  

For example, JP morgan has a call option with a strike price of 80 dollars.  the current price of the stock is $87.  The expiration date is January 20th.  The ASK price is just $1.56....why is this so incredibly low?


.2.  What happens if the price of the stock hits my strike price that I bought the option for, but it has not expired yet (e.g., has 2 months to expire), and it just keeps going higher and higher?  Does this mean I just continue to increase my return on the option?

.3.  Can I just click the sell button once I'm ""in the money"" and the stock price has reached the strike price of my option, and wallah, I get the full stock price despite only paying a small % of it?

.4.  What happens if the stock goes in the opposite direction as my option?  Does this mean that I OWE money, or just lose all the money I bought the option for?

.5.  Do I actually buy 1000 shares per contract in an option?  So if the share is ASKING $3 dollars, but the ACTUAL price is $87 - I'm only going to be paying $3000 for 1000 shares?

.6.  Aside from losing all the money I put down, is there any other risk here that I am missing?  

Thank you for your help and input.",0

Comparing the orange line (which represents Cash+ST Invas % of Assets) to the 2000 &amp; 2008 market crashes, it seems like BH acquired more assets when the market was the most expensive and sold when it crashed (when it was cheaper).

16-12-27,5klg04,Treasury Department Officials: Obama Supports ‘Explicit’ Guaranty on a ‘Defined Class’ of MBS - $FNMA $FMCC,"FYI...

Although the Obama Administration would like to eliminate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac outright, the president is in favor of an “explicit government guarantee on a defined class of mortgage-backed securities,” according to two Treasury Department officials. 
 

In a recent Treasury blog posting, Jane Dokko, deputy assistant secretary for financial economics and Sam Valverde, a counselor in the Office of Domestic Finance, write that, “Guaranteeing the timely payment of principal and interest on the MBS, the explicit government guarantee would be funded by financial institutions and would act as insurance against catastrophic losses.” 


The two authors, however, offer no details on what would shape a “defined class.” 

They add: “With this guarantee in place, investors who provide a source of funds for mortgage lending would be assured that the secondary market would continue to function regardless of the state of the economy.” 

Of course, the fate of Fannie and Freddie rests with the incoming Trump Administration, whose choice for Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, has already expressed his desire to privatize the two, but has offered no other details. 

Certain junior preferred shareholders in the GSEs (who are battling the government in court cases tied to the conservatorships) have floated the idea of having an explicit government guaranty on conventional MBS under a newly privatized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Solid little primer for what I feel is an important industry to understand. Also, I recommend downloading the research paper. You just have to put in an email address, and they don't even verify it. I'm not affiliated in any way; just trying to help.

Growth prospects:

&gt;As shown below, if machine vision continues to represent 5% of the total investment in robotics systems, global sales could approach $30 billion by 2020, and surpass $210 billion by 2030,1 compounding at an annual rate of 18% during the next fifteen years.

Major players:

&gt;Among machine vision manufacturers, CognexCGNX is well positioned to benefit from this rapid growth. Cognex manufactures sensors, components, and software for machine vision systems. AmbarellaAMBA and MobileyeMBLY also should benefit, producing advanced video and image processing chips and cameras, respectively. In addition, Ambarella and Mobileye should benefit as machine vision moves into autos, wearable devices, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). All of these companies also will become part of mobile robot ecosystems, such as those at iRobotIRBT and Adept TechnologyADEP, as well as Microsoft’sMSFT Kinect sensor suite and Intel’sINTC RealSense.",0

16-12-27,5kloa0,"$ETRM 1:70 reverse split tonight, rounding up fractional shares to the nearest whole number. Quick $3 profit off $0.05 investment before fees. Details inside.","**Edit: The opportunity has passed. Leaving this up for reference.**

$ETRM is currently trading at around $0.05. They will execute a 1:70 reverse split tonight, meaning they convert 70 shares into a single share at a new price. The total value is normally the same, so a single share would be worth $3.50. The catch here is if you have fractional shares after the split, they will round you up to the nearest whole share. Whether you own 70, 69, or even 1 share today, you'll have one share at the new price tomorrow.

So the strategy is to purchase a single share of $ETRM at $0.05 in the next hour, and sell it after the split for whatever you can get, likely around $3. You'll want to use Robinhood or else you'll lose any profits to brokerage fees. You'll also want to use a limit order due to low trading volume. In the past, **Robinhood can take a week or two before they'll allow you to sell the stock.** I'm not sure why this is, but worst case you're only out $0.05 so it's not especially risky.

Just keep in mind that **this idea does not scale.** You cannot buy 10 shares and make $30, it doesn't work like that. The most you'll profit is around $3, so buy one share and that's it.

#2: What stock do I pick? I've analyzed several different cannabis stocks but don't like the idea of owning one stock position and taking a gamble per say in that stock.

16-12-29,5kts39,Trump marks the top of the market. Market to correct 10% starting from today.,"On Monday, Donald Trump took all the credit for the 10% rise in the stock market since his election. Tuesday saw the stock market rise slightly, and today the Dow Jones is down by triple digits. 

Something is not right here. I think the analogy is: he marked the peak of the stock market (short term, of course) and we may be in for a short term correction going into the new year and into February too. 

https://thebigbreakout.wordpress.com/2016/12/26/peotus-trump-tweet-just-ended-the-trump-rally/

Since then, the stock market has peaked and has started to fall. He has essentially marked the peak in the stock market, and I expect stocks to fall ~10% from now until late January/February. 

Again: I am **not** calling for a stock market crash. I am **not** saying that a correction will happen. This is just a **suggestion** and I want people to **discuss** about this **real possibility** more, as we move onto the new year. 

I think volatility will be high. **The VIX rose by 8% today. And once the VIX starts rising like that, it is usually a sign that the stock market is about to fall/correct itself.**

16-12-29,5kts3p,"Real Estate: Low entry price point, high demand areas? Is Las Vegas a good buy?","Before you role your eyes and think that there's no such thing as cheap real estate in high demand areas, please hear me out. 

My wife and I are in the market for a rental property and are considering purchasing a condo at City Center in Las Vegas and renting it out (great location on the strip). The condo is going for around $250k and we've calculated our monthly payments (principle, HOA, tax and insurance) to be around $1,700. We plan to rent it out and based on our research we could collect on average $100-150 a night. This would obviously fluctuate based on the day of the week and time of the year. Based on these calculations, we'd need to be able to rent out our condo 20 days out of the month on average to break even. Even if we come up short some months we'll be fine as we have the cash to cover the shortfall. 

We like the idea of having our money work for us and having someone else build equity for us. We also would enjoy the tax breaks from claiming the interest on the property. 

We're both new to this and have a few questions: 

1) what are we missing and/or not considering? 
2) are there other high demand areas outside Vegas we should be considering with a low entry price point?
3) are we crazy? If so, why? 
4) if we hire a property management company to manage it for us, what is their typical fee? 

Appreciate any advice / feedback anyone could share. Like I said, we're new to this and don't even know where to start to find the answer to these questions.

16-12-28,5kqils,Recent graduate who wants to buy his first rental property in 12 months,"Hi all,

This holiday season I’ve set a goal to buy my first rental property Dec 2017, I’m very young so the idea of passive income is very appealing.  I’m a recent college grad making 53k pre tax, with no student debt.  With my supplemental income, I put away roughly 2500$ a month after bills.  That puts me around 30,000$, so with a 20$ down payment I can purchase a home worth ~150k.  I understand there are fees that come after purchasing a home, my parents have offered to help with the post signing costs.  However, if someone could offer a list of fees that’ll come up post signing, that’d be great too!

Few things to note:
I don’t own a house right now, so this will be my first house under my name.  I know this has some tax implications but I don’t know any technicalities. 
I have good friends who are real estate agents, not sure if there are any programs or things that maybe they have access to that can help with reducing costs or what not.
I am brand new to investing.  Just opened my first trading portfolio a month ago.  However my parents have history with exclusively rental properties.  So if there are other avenues worth looking into, please advise.  I know REIT exist but I haven’t had a chance to look into it, other than that I’m clueless on what my options are.

Thanks for reading through this.  Again, I’m brand new to all of this so any and all input is appreciated.  Thanks in advance!  

Happy holidays.

16-12-28,5kn2qr,Is your money safe from hackers at Interactive Brokers and Robinhood?,"The scenario: an unauthorized user gains access to your account without your knowledge; perhaps they execute some trades which lead to losses. Perhaps they successfully wire money out. Are you protected?

[Marketwatch](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/hacked-this-is-what-the-top-5-brokers-will-do-for-you-2015-10-27) did a survey on the subject last year, and five popular brokerages offer a guarantee against cyberattack related losses:

* Charles Schwab
* Fidelity Investments
* E*Trade Financial
* Scottrade
* TD Ameritrade

Some popular firms not mentioned by Marketwatch also offer a guarantee:

* [Vanguard](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/help/SecurityOnlineFraudPledgeContent.jsp)

There are, however, also notable exceptions:

* Robinhood
* Interactive Brokers
* Capital One

**Robinhood:**

The [RHF Customer Agreement](https://d2ue93q3u507c2.cloudfront.net/assets/robinhood/legal/RHF%20Customer%20Agreement.pdf), in article 17, includes the following wording:

""I agree that Indemnified Parties will have **no liability**, to Me or to third parties, or responsibility whatsoever for:(i) any Losses resulting from a cause over which Indemnified Parties do not have direct control, including but not limited to the failure of mechanical equipment, **unauthorized access**, theft, operator errors, government restrictions, force majeure (as defined in Section 15), Exchange rulings or suspension of trading;""

**Interactive Brokers:**

The [Interactive Brokers LLC Customer Agreement](https://gdcdyn.interactivebrokers.com/Universal/servlet/Registration.formSampleView?ad=us_customer_agreement.html), in article 3, includes the following wording:

""3. Responsibility for Customer Orders/Trades:
Customer acknowledges that IB does not know whether someone entering orders with Customer's user name/password is Customer. Unless IB is notified and agrees, Customer will not allow anyone to access Customer's account. Customer is responsible for the confidentiality and use of Customer's user name/password and agrees to report any theft/loss of such user name/password, or any unauthorized access to Customer's account, immediately by telephone or electronically through the IB website. **Customer remains responsible for all transactions entered using Customer's user name/password.**""

**Capital One:**

The [Capital One Investment Account Agreement](https://www.capitaloneinvesting.com/main/online-investment-account-agreement.aspx), in article 23, includes the following wording:

""23) Extraordinary Events You agree that Capital One Investing **will not be liable** to you or to third parties for losses incurred directly or indirectly by causes reasonably beyond its control, including but not limited to, government restrictions, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, wars, strikes, terrorist attacks, exchange or market rulings, interruptions of data processing services or communications, disruptions in orderly trading on any market or exchange, **unauthorized access** or operator errors.""

Neither agreement appears to include any additional clauses which specifically guarantee to make the customer whole in the event of their account being hacked.


So it seems neither Robinhood nor Interactive Brokers (nor Capital One, ...) feel like offering their customers any guarantees against hacking is necessary, and the customer will end up holding the bag if their account is compromised. 


Is this indeed the case? Has anyone with accounts at these brokers reached out to them for a clarification on why they feel it's OK not to offer such a guarantee while their competition does?

GPU/Hardware: nvidia, and amd.
Questions: What about FPGA manufacturers?  Is there anybody working on machine learning optimized chipsets (rather than repurposed GPUS?

Data: Facebook, Google.
Questions: What other companies are building massive datasets that could be used to feed machine learning platforms?  Are there any failing or failed companies setting on massively valuable datasets that make them attractive purchase targets?  What about something like a 23 And Me?

Cloud Infrastructure: Amazon, Google, MS.
Questions: Are there any cloud providers with a more singular focus on building out machine learning platforms?

Advertising, Software Applications: Google, Facebook (maybe Verizon with AOL/Yahoo/Mobile platform?)

Robotics/Self-Driving Cars: Tesla, Google.

Defense Contractors: Which defense contractors are focused on autonomous weapons platforms?

To my knowledge, Alphabet's Waymo and Uber are the only major companies targeting level 5 automation out of the gate. It is my understanding that this is the best approach to developing level 5, which is where the big industry will be. Other companies, like Tesla, seem to be trying incremental upgrades from level 2, 3, etc, and that's seems like it just wouldn't fundamentally work.

I could also target component manufacturers for autonomous vehicles. I already am invested in machine learning and networking, so that's out. I have Cognex shares, solely for their manufacturing usefulness, but I think they've at least dipped their toes in driving technologies. Mobileye is an option, but I don't know what their competition is. It very well could be that, like PCs, you want to be the person selling the chips (like Intel), not the one selling the whole device (like HP or Dell). Then there's the operating system. It seems people tend to view Uber or Waymo as the future analogy of ""Windows"" for cars, in that nearly every car with run on it. Maybe being Uber or Waymo in 5-10 years would actually be analogous to one of the countless, nearly identical cloud service offerings that we see today. In other words, there's much less of a network effect. After all, who would ~~invest~~ bet the farm on America's transportation system with a single network provider?

Their only real competitor is Nexmo from what I've gathered (which recently got acquired by Vonage).

For those not aware, twilio is used for real-time communications, e.g. to send text messages from mobile and web apps (E.g. if an app needs phone verification, twilio can handle it for the developers to just plug into their codebase. Uber, Airbnb and WhatsApp use it. )

Since the IPO, they more than doubled their starting price but have since plunged back to almost the starting price. They don't have a P/E ratio yet (even though they've released earnings I believe).",4

The ECB told Monte dei Paschi that **its capital shortfall was €8.8 billion ($9.19 billion),** far higher than the €5 billion expected when the Italian government organized a rescue of the country’s No. 3 lender last week. The higher amount reflects a serious decline in the bank’s financial health during the months in which Monte dei Paschi and the Italian government have struggled to find a solution to its problems....

&gt; The bank lost €20 billion deposits in the first nine months of the year **and €2 billion since early December.** Monte dei Paschi’s greater capital shortfall means the new government fund will have less firepower to help a clutch of other Italian banks which are struggling with large bad loans, meager profitability and thin capital cushions.

16-12-28,5kshpl,"I Hereby Declare ""The Second Financial Crisis"" Has Begun.","QUESTION: Who here believes that post-Trump rally has legs? Anybody? I thought so.

In simple words, I believe we are witnessing the biggest bull trap in the history of humankind. There is no reason whatsoever the market should have jumped from where it was before the elections to today. This is pure euphoria driven by seasonality, presidential elections and timing. All in all, the economy is still doing ""meh,"" oil is still 50% lower than it was two years ago and wages aren't going up. Meanwhile, debts are creeping and barely anyone can pay his students loan.

I believe today, specifically, today's actions, are the beginning of the next great financial crisis.

I think Trump is great - hell, I'm really pro-Trump - but many of his policies are going to destabilize the world. Mexico will be angry when he does build his walls or when he calls them ""rapists"" or whatever again, China will be pissed when he attacks them for manipulating their currency, Europe will be angry he's not taking Syrians, etc.

Long-term, his policies are indeed great, but short term, this will be a catastrophe for the economy. **My target for the S&amp;P500 at the end of the year is 1,400** While it might look huge, this is barely a 40% drop from today's level, something that hasn't been achieved in years, but that is about to happen.

Big corporations worldwide want Trump to fail. If he suceeds and the US recovers, more countries will want the same thing. This will mean the end of EU, etc. For this reason alone, I think that for the first two years of his mandate, they will systematically sabotage the economy.

I believe the rise was only preparation for the big crash to come. Once it starts crumbling down, everything will follow. A 10% crash will lead to panic, which will lead to a 20% crash, etc.

I have begun with a relatively small position, and will add if this stupid rally continues:

[http://i.imgur.com/jfpFRfM.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/jfpFRfM.jpg)

My personal gut feeling says we've reached a top for 5+ years at least. I wish I had bought more puts.

The company currently has strong cash flow statistics and decent profit margins on it's products. I have read the reports and they appear to be attempting to expand into Australian markets. Both revenue and profits appear to be holding steady and yet the company is worth almost nothing. I understand that there are currency controls in place to prevent dividends and that harms the price but it shouldn't be this low. Also it has been repeatedly audited by a San Francisco based auditing company(though it is pretty small). So far the only thing I can think of being a valid reason is the falling value of fertilizer, but if their revenue has remained steady wouldn't that mean they are coping well? I feel like there is something so obvious that I am missing and if anyone could please tell me what it is I would be much obliged.",6

16-12-28,5kt05k,MPET? Up over 600% since their strategic merger. Gained 15% last two days.,"Starting in August Mpet made a strategic merger with Tellurian to develop Liquified Natural Gas(LNG). Now for some reason LNG is being thought of as the next big thing in the oil industry.

I believe this is a reverse merger since Tellurian will control 95% of mpet after this. So it should be the same as if Tellurian itself is going on the market. Tellurian is a new company though so not really much information in it. Charif Souki is running Tellurian. He was CEO of Cheniere (LNG). Which is successfully up and running now $40 a share. For some reason he is starting his own company and doing the same thing as that company did.

Since then GE has invested 25 million with Tellurian on this project and Total(another company) made a 207 million investment with Tellurian. To me these seem to be huge amounts of money to be throwing around. But also looking around other companies in the oil industry also throw around equally large amounts of money as investment.

I'm not sure what else to look up besides recent news, but I wonder is this a good investment? Or is this some sort of scheme where I can lose my money. I'm not too knowledgeable about oil companies.


Hoping for some thoughts and opinions though.

I am thinking of pursuing a momentum strategy based around taking equally weighted (EW) positions in either the top two (EW Top 2) or top three (EW Top 3) asset classes ranked by their performance over the past four months. Every month I would re-balance to maintain either EW Top 2 or Top 3, and divest from asset classes which fall out of that range and invest in those that take their place. I will be monitoring the following asset classes:

* PDBC - Commodities
* SCHE - Emerging Markets
* SCHF - Europe and Asia Large-Cap
* IAU    - Gold
* SCHH - Real Estate
* FENY  - US Energy
* FNCL  - US Financials
* IVV    - US Large-Cap
* SCHA - US Small-Cap
* TLO    - US Long-Term Treasury Bonds
* BIL     - US Short-Term T-Bills (Cash)

I am looking for three pieces of advice. Should I use EW of the Top 3 or Top 2? Are there any asset classes I should add? Are there better ETFs to gain exposure to these asset classes?

16-12-29,5kyawj,What stocks are on your watch list going forward?,"I have positions in EXOL and SPCL. Both I believe are poised for large movements. Probably more so for SPCL (you can find some good threads on here about why this is the case), but EXOL has had a series of good news over the last few months. They had a 100% increase in revenue before the holiday season, recently launched brand presence on Amazon, and have an NFL player as a brand ambassador.

These are the two I'm looking at and analyzing each piece of news for. I'm also watching some weed stocks in the US like MCOA and AMMJ. Both could*** be a good long term play, but both also may present good opportunity for quick trades.

What are you guys watching?",5

Mr. Lampert for years has pumped money into Sears to help keep it afloat. The company, which had just $258 million in cash on hand as of October, said it would use the new liquidity to fund its operations.

Also the entire portfolio consists of concentrated individual stocks, and is that reflected in the site's appraisal of risk?

I am also weighted heavily in a few of my favorite sectors. Should I try to branch out?

A nice pick for y'all. Instead of betting on binary events for biotech, bet on binary events in oil. 

IAE is a small cap offshore driller with producing assets in the North Sea. The binary event is the Greater Stella Area first oil - which is scheduled for mid January 2016. The production platform, FPF-1, set sail and reached stella in August. First oil was initially planned for late November but is now delayed until mid January.

About Stella:

* 30 MMboe of 2P reserves
* FPF-1 will start with 5 wells
* Ithaca owns 55% working interest, with the remaining divided between Dyas and Petrofac
* Stella will almost double IAE's production capacity, adding 16,000 boepd of capacity

About Ithaca:

* Mkt. Cap of ~800 Million
* Net debt of close to 600 million. Was hit hard by the oil price drop. If Stella fails they're utterly fucked
* OpEx of $25/boe with the Stella capacity
* Hedged until mid 2017 at $61/boe

Outlook:

* Stella successful: $2.80/share
* Stella failure: $1.50/share
* FPF-1 blows up: $0.00/share

16-12-29,5kz5k0,2017 Portfolio,"Figured I'd post my picks for 2017 with a small snippet for each. My strategy is purchasing dividend aristocrat stocks from the big sectors and adding any value stocks of well established companies that have 3-4% dividend yields, along with several small and mid-cap growth stocks. I also buy industry leaders or companies with a lot of potential i.e TSN or HRL. My top 5 allocation percentages are Consumer Staples (19%), Industrials (16%), Financials (11%), Consumer Discretionary (11%), Technology (10%). Going long on all of these FYI.

Any thoughts or suggestions are welcome. I am fairly new to investing (3 months) but I have done my DD on all of these picks with their financials so I won't go in too much into the numbers aspect. I also prefer to purchase companies that I know about or use their products or services often, and that is reflected in a majority of these picks. 

**Materials**

Scotts Miracle Gro- Mid cap exposure, Bank of America upgraded it from ""hold"" to ""buy"" this month with a $105 target. It is in a very cyclical sector and most of their revenue will be made in the spring and summer months with their garden and lawn care products. Also a weed play I guess I'll throw that in there... 

Dow Chemical- One of the first stocks I purchased, one year price targets I've looking at have DOW as high as $72 and stock price is expected to grow at least 7% each of the next 5 years. Large market cap company providing services to many consumer markets and has a wide moat.

Huntsman Corp- Don't remember how I found this mid-cap stock but company reported $0.38 earnings per share for Q3 2016, topping estimates of $0.36 by $0.02. This company sells polyurethanes, performance products, and pigments for big companies such as BMW, Chevron and Proctor

**Consumer Discretionary**

Home Depot- Industry home supplies and improvement leader, more Americans are buying homes as well. Sales and profit are at record highs and same store sales are up 6%. In my opinion Home Depot is much better than it's competitors Lowe's and Menards. Since it is also dependent on the housing market 2017 should bode well for this retailer.

Walt Disney- Huge conglomerate, Star Wars is making them money, ESPN is not, but exploring options for cord cutters and I am optimistic they will do so

Shake Shack- Introduced breakfast menu along with mobile ordering app which is doing great and they just opened their 100th store this year with more to come in 2017. They only open stores in high foot traffic areas such as malls or city centers. For example, they will be opening up a Shack in the middle of Wrigleyville in 2019. Total revenue increased 40% in Q3 2016 with same store sales up 2.9%

Under Armour- Growth stock near year lows, high potential to eat into market share of Nike, Addidas. Has notable endorsements from Tom Brady, Steph Curry, Bryce Harper. They also have a deal with MLB starting in 2020 to supply all the uniforms. They have great athletic wear based on my experience.

**Financials**

Discover Financial Services- Great credit cards and customer service and since they are a bank as well they offer services such as saving accounts and student loans which many students use and something they will continue to push. It was between Discover and Visa for me and I think the former has more growth potential going forward.

CitiGroup- Big 4 bank which I think is undervalued by many. Will be one of beneficiaries of higher interest rates. 

SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF- Regional bank exposure, more people will be getting mortgages as rates keep rising and banks will make more money on higher interest rates

Bank of America- Bought in at $17, big bank, low P/E lot of cash on hand and will benefit the most out of the big 4 banks due to rising interest rates.

**Telecom**

Verizon Communications- Industry leader, many cell towers and coverage and will lead the charge into 5G networks

**Energy**

Chevron- Dividend Arisocrat, bullish price target set at $130

Exxon- Dividend Aristocrat, Tilleron as new SOS helps as well in helping negotiate with other countries knowing what would benefit the industry domestically and abroad

**Industry**

3M- Industry leader and dividend aristocrat, we use their products every day without even knowing it i.e. post its

Stanley Black and Decker- Great power tools and locks, mid-cap exposure, more home buying will result in increased demand for tools used for remodeling and construction.

Waste Management- People create garbage and someone needs to take it. Industry leader

CSX Corp- Railroad exposure. With Trump promising infrastructure improvements nothing is more cheaper and efficient to carry supplies and materials than by rail.

General Electric- Glad they sold off their financial unit, they can focus on what made them a huge conglomerate. Good price and portfolio must have in my opinion.

**Technology**

Microsoft- Entry into the cloud market will be big, their Surface computers are nothing to sneeze at either.

Intel- Great computer chips, always use them and they will be releasing new chips in 2017. AMD and NVDA do not scare this industry leader.

Activision Blizzard- Great yearly titles such as Call of Duty and WoW. Bit down this year but their entry into E-Sports will be big.

Cisco- Industry leader in office phones, communication equipment, reputable, good dividend.

**Consumer Staples**

PepsiCo- I picked this over Coca-Cola because there is better diversity within PepsiCo in their snacks business. People are also eating healthier which is why brands such as Tropicana and Quaker within the PepsiCo portfolio will give them that extra boost.

Kraft Heinz- Who doesn't love ketchup and cheese? This merger was helped by names such as Berkshire Hathaway &amp; 3G Capital. Buffet's largest holding as well.

Proctor &amp; Gamble Co- Heavyweight industry leader offering us products such as Bounty, Tide, and Crest toothpaste. People use their products every day. 

Tyson Foods- Purchased the dip, they are an industry leader and I am certain they will bounce back in the long-term.

Hormel Foods- Mid cap stock. Net profit has steadily increased last couple of years, their acquisition of Justin's LLC who specialize in nut snacks and SPAM maker Applegate will turn out to be a revenue producer in the coming years.

**Healthcare**

Johnson &amp; Johnson- Dividend Aristocrat around since 1886. They sell most of the household items we use every day such as Tylenol, band aids, and baby products. These guys are here to stay.

Pfizer- Great dividend stock to keep purchasing. Healthcare was a little beat up this year but with the Trump administration promising less drug regulations companies like PFE have the potential to grow their revenue moving forward.

**Utilities**

Brookfield Infra Str Partners Lp- Spinoff from Brookfield Asset Management. Has subsidiaries in the energy, transportation, utilities and communication sectors in US, UK, Australia and Canada. Not a pure utility stock but has it's fingers in a wide array of sectors and is expected to increase it's cash flow by 9% next year. 4.65% div yield as well.

**ETFs**

Vanguard Russell 2000 Growth Index Fund- Mirrors the small-cap growth stocks in the Russel 2000 index. Up 9% this year and potential for more gains in a business friendly Trump administration.

PowerShares S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF- Pays a monthly dividend which is great and contains companies such as CME Group, GM, Ctipillar, HCP. 0.3% expense ratio

Do you grow and harvest what you eat?… I didn’t think so.

But 100 years ago there was a much better chance that you did.

In 1900, 41% of the U.S. workforce was dedicated to agriculture. But today, fewer than 2% of the U.S. labor force works in agriculture.

Food production is industrialized. And corporations continue to gobble up the remaining mom and pop farms.

There are downfalls to large scale production but without it, we wouldn’t be able to sustain the world’s 7.3 billion people. So let’s take a closer look today. I’ll show you the powerful agriculture automation that’s underway… and a [perfect company](http://bigtrendinvestor.com/index.php/2016/12/24/one-stock-on-top-of-the-food-chain-agriculture-automation/) to profit on the trend.

16-12-30,5l24f6,"Once again it's buy the dip...","Today’s market action was mostly flat after Wednesday’s hard reversal to the downside.

So what now?

Tricky territory.  Possible the chop today was digesting a drop that was too far too fast. a pause in a word before more the slide down resumes tomorrow but the recent rally was so fast to the upside there is a chance it’s going to take more than one-day’s hemorrhage to kill the bull.

Yesterday’s sudden slam turned the longer-term breadth trend negative but short-term breadth turned up today so there are cross currents in play.

As often happens at the end of a move, the recent up move in this case, by the time it is clear it could be reversing, there is much at is oversold and could easily bounce to confound the change of trend.  If I had to guess I would guess the market bounces before any more significant downside.

That is a guess based, most notably because SPY (the S&amp;P500 ETF), which topped on 12/13 and has now managed to pull back for nearly two weeks into oversold territory. Also, more than 40 of the stocks on my nifty-fifty stock list have been on sells now for two days – that is almost always the bottom or the beginning of the bottom of a swing (I say almost because when it isn’t it is because the market has suddenly turned into a hard downtrend, like in 2008).",0

If we take the first one, GM financial, they have a coupon of 3.25%, so if I buy $10 000 face value of bonds for the ask price of $10 106, it should pay 3.25% or $325 per year. The simple yield should then be 3.216% (325/10106). Sometimes, people do yield to maturity and the coupons payments are assumed to be reinvested at the same rate but that would only make the yield even higher. Since that bond matures in just 6 mos, even if you assume only 1 coupon payment, the yield calculation still doesn't work. Can someone explain how to use the information in that image to calculate the yield they have posted?

I don't have money to fulfill 200 calls at $11 share (I don't have 2200), if I sell this call option that I bought is it under the same possibilities of just selling a call option that was not originally bought? I ask this because I'm trying to figure out if I buy calls in NVDA and I can't afford to successfully fulfill the calls to purchase the stocks to sell if I can just sell the call option I bought but not have any expiration on it. 

Basically what I'm asking is if I sell the call option I bought, will it have an expiry date and do I have to worry about it possibly losing money after I have sold said calls (that I bought).

Thank you and I apologize if I was confusing!",0
16-12-30,5l3e58,Self Driving Cars and Housing Prices,"I have a thesis about self driving cars and thought I would share for discussion. 

It seems clear that home prices are closely connected to how close they are to centers of economic activity.(lets just say ""cities"") Further, prices decrease as you move away from cities according to some equilibrium that balances the increasing cost and time of a commute to the center of a city. 

Self driving cars will drop the effective cost of this commute by a large factor, and thereby cause the distribution of home prices around city center to become much more broad. If you can get in a self driving car for 30 mins and work during that 30 mins, why would you pay twice as much for a home just to reduce that time to 5 minutes? If the car has a low operating cost the effect is amplified further.

So I think it is obvious that once a mass market self driving car becomes available, it will have a powerful effect in terms of broadening the distribution of home prices around city centers. In a sense the radius of comfortable living distance from ones place of work will grow substantially. A person who could previously tolerate a 10 minutes drive to work may easily tolerate a 30 minute drive to work in a self driving car, and this will have a direct effect on the geographic distribution of home prices.

Furthermore, because area increases with radius squared, the amount of land that is within livable distances to economic centers will grow by a large factor, which in general will increase the supply of desirable housing by a larger factor. If you suppose the acceptable commuting distance is generally increased by a factor of 2,(which seems quite conservative to me) then the desirable livable area around the city increases by a factor of 4. In areas where more land is available, this will cause an increased supply of desirable homes, and may drop the price of homes in general beyond just broadening the price distribution.

So there are a few basic parts to the argument:

1. The price of homes is largely determined by distance to economic centers. 
2. The relationship between home price and distance to economic centers is governed by an equilibrium between home prices and transportation costs.(driving time and cost)
3. Self driving cars will greatly reduce the labor time(and maybe direct cost) associated with driving to work, and thereby greatly change the relationship between housing prices and distance to economic centers. This will tend to cause home prices to be distributed more broadly around city centers.
4. Self driving cars will increase the radius of desirable living distances from city centers by a significant factor, and the supply of desirable homes will increase by the square of that factor, which may drop the price of homes in general.  

So I guess some points for discussion are whether you agree with these arguments, what the flaws are, etc., and to the extent you agree, whether there are any good investing choices to make in light of these arguments.",26

I imagined that if the agreed price was 100M, and the full 100M was allocated to goodwill, future earnings would be higher due to the lack of depreciation expenses. On the other end of the spectrum, allocating the full 100M to assets and 0 to goodwill will maximize the depreciation expenses in the following years.

16-12-31,5l7fo4,More or less my own mini-DD on gold investments for early 2017,"First of all, I was breaking even about all year and made great profits off of the November rally. Well, I got hit hard after the rate hike, this month.  I was heavily invested in CHK. It tanked a bit. I moved around to a bunch of crappy penny stocks and lost more. BAAAD month, man. Anyways, I am currently holding a certain stock which shan't be named (it rhymes with ""gray pug"").  I finally bought in, mid-rally, yesterday. I made big gains. Stop-loss triggered this morning. I reloaded at the peak and got locked out of making a day trade because of regulations n all that, so I watched as I went back to where I started before yesterday. fml. So, I'm bagholding it for the weekend against my will; however, I'm bullish as hell.

A big driver in this last rally has been international tension, particularly with Obama's ""stirring the pot"" before he leaves office.  Trump has very clear ties to Russia.  DNS experts found a live connection from Trump's businesses to one of Moscow's major banks; he's been buddy-buddy with Putin; U.S. Intel has their new uncovered evidence; Trump made a PINNED post on his Twitter, today, praising Putin for not reacting and for Americans to move on or whatever.  Trump's really transparent with this.  Whether you're for or against him, it's an obvious reality.  Well, Obama's recent decisions are stirring a bit of tension between Trump, the GOP, the American people, and Russia.  Sanctions were issued and all that. Whatever. It made gold rise a bit, so that's all I care about at the moment. This news is everywhere, and you likely have already heard it.

My next piece of info is about Muslims! No, this has nothing to do with ISIS, for once.  It's about the new Shariah standard established this month.  Apparently, Muslims used to have to invest in coins and jewelry and all that if they wanted to invest in gold. Now, they can choose stocks backed by gold.  It opens the door to 1.6 billion people, or so I read. The fine details don't matter too much. All that matters is that it's very bullish. Here's one link on it: http://www.thenational.ae/business/economy/sharia-compliant-gold-standard-to-attract-massive-islamic-investments

My next bullish tidbit is in reference to our beloved ""gray pug"" stock.. Look at the chart data from the past couple of weeks.  You'll see what is called the ""cup and handle"" formation.  We are currently in the handle, and I firmly believe the bottom of the handle is long gone, after today.  All you need to know is that it be bullish, boys. Here's another nifty link: http://www.stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns:cup_with_handle_continuation

My third bullish observation is pretty easy to find and surprisingly overlooked, I guess.
Look at the 10-year chart for gold, and go find Dec-Jan transitions for each year.  Here's a link where you can do that: http://www.apmex.com/spotprices/gold-price
Now, here's what you will find: 7/10 years saw a jump of some kind by sometime in January.  The three years excluded are 2008, 2011, and 2013. 2008 and 2011 were delayed and didn't see a jump until February rolled around. 2013 was a straight-up falling knife. So, that means that 9/10 of the past years have seen a jump from Dec-Jan or Feb at the latest. To me, that's roughly a 90% chance of big gains coming. (Maybe a smart extra thing to do here would be to research what exactly caused gold to plummet in the beginning of 2013 and to make sure that 2017 isn't a repeat of this anomaly?)

My theory is that all of these catalysts are going to come together and form one huge, earlier-than-expected ride to da moon. The dollar has been falling a bit over the past few sessions.  I firmly believe that we are in a bubble, and personally, I believe that Trump's idea of over-privatizing everything will cause this bubble to have some new baby bubbles. Foreign relations aren't looking so good. I heard some expert saying that the rate hikes aren't going to be able to keep up with inflation, next year.
I predicted that gold was set to soar by the end of the year, and I was right (No evidence other than maybe one Facebook comment from November).  And, I predicted the final gold pullback that was today, just yesterday (I sent a message with this in it to a friend, yesterday).  Unfortunately, the pullback came earlier and harder than expected (twss), and bye bye profits on that.  Sure, they're not he strongest predictions, but they were accurate, at least.

Honestly, I just want to share this all with you in hopes that you guys can all make your own gains, and mob mentality can really help to make that happen.  Let me know what you guys are thinking about gold and why.  The better we discuss, the better we can make strategic gains.

I hope you all have a happy new year, make tons of gains, and don't lose half of your money because of me. :)

Another interesting tidbit, the US has just reached record amounts of exports in crude and gasoline and now is a net exporter to Mexico and South America for the first time ever. And the amount is growing. 

https://www.google.com/amp/www.cnbc.com/amp/2016/12/29/us-refiners-export-record-amounts-of-gasoline-diesel.html?client=safari

After reading this my first inclination was to look into US refiners and exporters of gasoline, but after doing so I have also discovered how Trumps plan to tax imports from Mexico and south America(border adjusted tax) may have huge impacts on US refiners. 

https://www.google.com/amp/www.cnbc.com/amp/2016/12/21/tax-changes-taxing-imports-plan-has-chance-of-passing.html?client=safari

So this has lead me to a number of questions: Do I go long on US refineries? Short Mexico? Long on RBOB and WTI? Will the border adjusted tax even go through and if it does will crude and petroleum products be tax exempt? If they are not exempt then the Middle East will have to supply them, would oil tankers benefit from this?

Anyways, there is certainly an opportunity here and the key is determining whether or not petroleum products will be exempt from tariffs and how much it will effect US refiners. 

What I do know is Mexico is pretty fucked in terms of their transportation of oil, their refining efficiency, and threats from citizens wanting to boycott gas stations and burn them down. This is likely already priced into the market, but I bet there is going to be a lot of movement leading up to trumps decision to tax US imports.

I realize there are apps out there such as Stock Wars and a handful of alternatives that are really good but still I find them lacking. I'm not trying to bash on the developers of these games either because I've used them in the past and learned much from them. 

There's games such as leap frog for kids to show them mathematics and grammar or even typing skills but absolutely NOTHING for finance. Why not create a standalone game where you can insert a disc into a PC or gaming console or just a simple download where it simulates all the same rules but the player is battling it out on the market against the computer/AI that would use realistic scenarios?

16-12-31,5lcaf1,Is there a cutoff date to buy NXPI shares before QCOM buyout completes?,"I bought about 60 (purchased at $105, sigh :() +10 (purchased at $97) NXPI stocks via robinhood. I received a big document from them last week asking me to choose an option regarding how to treat my share holdings after NXPI gets merged with QCOM. It was not clear as what are my options but it appeared that if I do nothing, the shares will be bought back by QCOM at the price of $110 per share and be credited to my account. 

However what was interesting was that the document dated 11/22/16 listed that I only had 60 shares not 70, however as of 11/21 I had 70 shares. That makes me think there's a cutoff date before which all purchases will be honored with the $110 rate, but it is not clear to me how the rest will be handled. Can someone help explain? ",16

16-12-30,5l49ef,Coffeehouse bond allocation,"I am trying to move past my Vanguard Target Retirement fund in favor of a portfolio with lower expenses and possibly better returns. After manically studying lazy portfolios and backtesting them online, I was content with the returns and downside protection of the Coffeehouse portfolio with 40% bonds. (My wife and I are in our late 20's, good at saving, and hope to drop to part-time work in our 50's).

The Coffeehouse strategy seems to place big bets in small cap and real estate, hopes to capture returns in those categories, and smooths out the volatility with a high bond allocation. The prevailing wisdom I've read on line makes me think 10% bonds is more where I should be. I also don't know if bonds will be reliable going forward for smoothing out volatility.

Anyway, any feedback on customizing the Coffeehouse portfolio for someone in their 20's who can stay disciplined with a strategy is appreciated. (When backtesting, I generally try to keep my Std Dev of Monthly returns to sub-12%.)
