15-01-01,Should I hold my stock in an LLC to avoid litigation risk?,"I was recently reading a book on LLCs and the author of course mentioned holding rental properties in this type of entity to avoid litigation risk from tenants. However the author also mentioned holding stocks and bonds in LLCs. 

For some background- I am a content publisher and believe I am somewhat exposed to the possibility of frivolous lawsuits. While I do already maintain several partnership LLCs to do consulting work through and whatnot, I still publish some apps, websites, ect under my own name. I also typically sign non-competes with my employer at my day-job so I could be sued (probably not with any justification but I have heard horror stories) by an employer at some point in the future.

Is it worth holding Stocks and Bonds in an LLC to avoid personal litigation risk? I have heard of people holding ""Umbrella Insurance"" for this kind of thing as well. At what point is it cost effective to do this in your opinion? Just looking to start a discussion here. Just to note I also do max out my retirement accounts and I know that those are generally protected from lawsuits and bankruptcy.

He backed it up with literature and claiming that some people can make 1000% profit of there inintial investement over 2 months. I am very skeptical but I asked some questions and he explained it to me this way: Basically only focus on S&amp;P 500. You buy a ""postion"" for long or short. Either it goes down or up. You specify the amount of points. If you put 50$ dollars and you are right then you get 50$. You can also put in a stop. The broker will then automatically abandon the position. 

Does somebody know about this form of trading? Does Index trade come close to it? Can you give me a more detailed explanation of it? He also mentioned that there are schemes which can yield long term profit. Is there a good website which goes into detail about this kind of trade? What stockbroker/site is best for such thing?

15-01-01,"My strategy/outlook for 2015. What's yours?","I expect a substantial pullback in the US market and USD, and for commodities and foreign markets to rebound. 

* Much of the fundamental data on the US economy is still abysmal - personal and national debt in the stratosphere and growing, terrible trade deficits, weak employment data.

* The phantom USD strength will wan. This dollar surge has been due to the expectation that the Fed will raise rates sometime soon, and that Mario Draghi will implement QE in Europe. Neither of these events has transpired, and once the markets understand that the Fed cannot afford to raise rates there will be a USD sell-off, which will lead to...

* Commodity prices will turn around. Hard-assets took a beating in Q3 and Q4 as investors anticipated the Fed raising rates, but once the market realizes that the economy is too weak to handle a rate-hike commodity prices will rise. 

* Investors will look to foreign markets for high returns in 2015. If you weren't able to reach into the US market during the last several years and get a piece of this bull market then you've missed your chance. The DOW was hitting new all-time highs on a weekly basis in Q4. If you buy now, you're buying the top. Even without all the pressure of the horrid fundamentals, the US market is due for a cyclical correction. 

* In addition, very quietly several foreign exchanges have had great years. The Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index (SHCOMP) was up over 50%. The Ho Chi Minhi Stock Exchange in Vietnam was up 18%. The Egyptian Exchange is up over 30%. The S&amp;P is not the only game in town and investors will look abroad to get out of harms way in 2015.

But I'm still dependent on that 401(k), and that still bothers me a bit.  One thing that bothers me is that 401(k) disbursements are treated as income.  The paranoid ""black_UN-helicopter"" part of my brain tells me that the gubment is going to let me carefully steward those funds, only to tax the shit out of it once their drunken-sailor spending can't otherwise be supported.  Is this a greater risk than counting on a lower cap-gains rate, and getting ""double-taxed""?  On paper, the 401k wins by a long shot, but should I count on that?

The US is one of the most stable governments in recent history, yet I'm nervous about them knowing where my nest egg is.  It seems like the 401(k) remains the best first option, but I'm wondering about out of the box retirement investing options (I imagine it goes without saying, legal options) that avoid being such a tasty and plunderable target as income from a 401(k).

15-01-02,Investing in oil in 2015.,"I was wondering what is the best way to invest in oil. Should I go with futures/options, ETFs, or stocks? 

The problems with stocks is that I don't think they mimic the price of oil as directly as a future/option would. 

I'm new to investing so any advice would greatly be appreciated.

Also do you think oil is a good investment? It's basic economics, when the price of oil drops some oil projects become less profitable. When these projects become less profitable, they close down. Now there is less supply in the market; so demand should go up. Therefore, the price should go back up. 

I'd like to hear your ideas.  ",5

After reading through their recent annual report I have two questions.

1) How are they valued at 1 billion (market cap) if their subsidiary Cogeco Cable Inc (CCA.TSX) is valued at 3.5 billion?

2) Their average FCF over the last 3 years is $186 million. They are not a negative or no growth company (12% 10-year average revenue growth) so what's justifying such a low valuation? ",2
15-01-02,"Does buying similar funds from different sources qualify as ""diverse""? Is it worth doing?","I'm picking mutual funds for my 401(k), trying to stick to low fee index funds. We have access to spartan sp500 (.02% fee) and spartan extended (.05% fee). We also have brokeragelink but for funds only, no etfs or other shenanigans. 

Is it worthwhile to pair the spartan sp500 fund with a vanguard sp500 fund ($50-$75 trade fee) or is that not actually diversified since they're in mostly the same stocks? Would getting vanguard small-cap be a much better complement? It doesn't seem to be doing nearly as well as the large caps.

15-01-02,TSP Lifecycle 2040 - Too Conservative?,"I'm 33. 20-25 years from retirement. My retirement investment at this point is, effectively, entirely in the TSP 2040 fund.

I picked 2040 since its a bit more aggressive than 2030.

That said... Here's the current fund breakdown.

G - 18.77

F - 5.73

C - 38.2

S - 16.1

I - 21.1

I'm aware that these sort of funds won't normally achieve the same rates of return as all-index fund type options.

My question is fairly simple. Is the 2040 fund too conservative? Pushing 20% in the G fund seems... high especially at the whopping 2ish% its at. I know the bond market has been crap for returns.

The fund certainly hasn't been horrible for me, but am I cutting myself off at the knees?

15-01-02,Where should I put the small monthly amounts I make so that they will grow some?,"Hello! I am a 20 year old engineering intern making his way through college. I have calculated about how much money I will need per month since moving off campus (over estimated it to be safe) and I should each month come away with 400-500 dollars. This is working part time, however this number changes with things like break weeks and amount of work I can get on weekends (it will only increase.... unless I'm fired...:c). I have done a lot of what this sub recommends doing with small amounts, buying books to learn, setting up a nest fund (around 2 grand saved up) etc. I am not looking to invest the money I have saved up currently (it is my emergency money), but just to put the money I will be making somewhere so it grows, even if only a little.

Also, due to being able to work more, as soon as summer begins in May, I will probably be coming away with closer to 3k a month so spend because of all the OT I can get. I'm not really sure what I should do with the money, I don't want to be filthy rich (okay I do, but realistically speaking) but I want to make sure I am setting myself up to live comfortably in the future.

I have some loans, but they are low interest government loans, and they don't need to be paid off until I graduate. I am not worried about them. 

tl;dr: for the next few months I will be making small amounts that I don't need to spend. Have purchased books and have an emergency fund. Where should I put the money coming in?

70% of the US economy is consumer spending. Consumer spending is fueled by jobs. The unemployment rate may be down, but it doesn't take into account discouraged workers. It also doesn't take into account stagnant living wages and people who have only found part-time employment.

Couple that with inevitable inflation from all those years of QE and bailing out. Also couple it with inevitable rise in treasury bond interest rates (resulting in shift out of stocks and into treasuries), not only because of inflation, but also because we still have a debt problem that's been swept under the rug for the time being. Don't even get me started on the credit card and student loan bubbles.

With all of those matters considered, a 15K dow is still 1,000 points higher than the 14K high of October 2007 (right before the financial collapse).

I was reading through the standard government documents trying to get a reading on this, but I couldn't figure it out. If I was interested in cashing out a portion of this to invest elsewhere, and I currently make less than 30,000 dollars a year (because I'm a full time student and make 0 dollars a year), I pay ZERO taxes on this, right? I just want to be ABSOLUTELY sure about this before I pay a fucking massive gains tax.


Follow up question - I'm looking for a cheap trading stock to throw about a grand into with the hopes of buying between 50-100 shares. Someone recommended Talisman because they were just purchased by some Spanish company and their stock went from less than a dollar to seven. I'd like gains like that, because if I'm really not paying tax on the gains, I have no problem with some quick (3-6 month) gains. As far as brokerage fees go, I'll probably use our family broker, and won't have to pay fees. Obviously, I'm trying to put myself in the best possible position haha to have a solid slush fund for when I graduate from college.

15-01-03,ELI5 Index Fund,"The S&amp;P 500's 5yr avg was 15.45% and for the tumultuous past decade it was 7.67% 


If you were to dump 100k into an index fund in 2010, you would have something like 8% returns less fees, give or take. Then you add up the rate of annual inflation from the past 5 years it rounds out to 9%, so your real returns is hopefully 8% x 5 years = 40%, this is still pre-tax


If you were to put that same 100k into say Starbucks' IPO @ 23.28, those 4295 shares would be each up 58.16, which is 249,797, or 149% returns, divided by 5 years, 29.8%, but the same 9% applies so it's really 20.8%


Is an index fund just a go-to answer for this subreddit for people who are ""looking for more income but I don't know what I'm doing""? that there exists a visibility bias?

Sexy biotech company that just reported a shingles vaccine in the end of December with 97% effectiveness in phase 3 clinical trial. They also have 26 other ventures at the moment, including joint projects with JNJ.

If you don’t really care about all this technical stuff, just know that this is a biotech that is flying way under the radar at the moment. (SOMEWHAT RISKY)



* ARRY – 120 shares


Another sexy biotech company working on cancer treatments. They stand to receive $85 million once they close a deal to regain rights to a late-stage MEK inhibitor, binimetinib, from Novartis. (SOMEWHAT RISKY)



* DDD – 10 shares


I am betting on this because I anticipate growth in the 3D printing industry in 2015, and this is the largest corporation in the industry at the moment. They are all set to showcase new innovations at CES between January 6th and 9th. We’ll see how they do after the showcase to decide whether this is a short or long game. (RISKY)



* GASE – 9,000 shares


Uhhhh yeah this one is pretty stupid. This is a developmental natural gas company in Ukraine. They took a massive hit last Spring, and I’m just betting that Putin doesn’t invade for long enough that this company can make a rebound. (BATSHIT INSANE)

15-01-03,Invest carefully. There is turbulence ahead.,"Has anyone heard of Jim Rickards?  He’s the chief global strategist to the West Shore Funds, a portfolio manager, economist, and an author, but he’s also an advisor on capital markets to the US intelligence community.  According to Rickards, high inflation is on the horizon.  Rickards says in the intro to his latest book *The Death of Money* that the international monetary situation is similar now to what it was in the late 1970s, a few years after the gold standard was eliminated, and when inflation rose 50 percent during five years.  He’s particularly concerned with the similarly low Federal Reserve dollar index, and the actions of the IMF.  
  
On top of that, the Federal Reserve is printing money at an astronomical rate—according to Rickards, writing in 2014, they’ve increased the base money supply to over four times what it was in 2008.  When the money supply is increased, inflation usually follows.  
  
Plus, countries have been attempting to abandon the petrodollar.  According to [this Huffington Post article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alastair-crooke/petrodollar-us-saudi-policy_b_6245914.html), the 1973 energy trade agreement effectively gave the dollar a “crude oil standard” instead of a gold standard—instead of gold, dollars could now be exchanged for oil.  Then the value of oil in US Treasuries fell sharply in the early 2000s.  With US sanctions and current foreign policy, including a worsening relationship with the oil producer Saudi Arabia (because of our talks with Iran--my point, not the Huffington Post's), and our sanctions against Russia because of Ukraine, many countries feel they no longer need to hold to the agreement.  
  
The dollar fell, and almost collapsed, when we lost the gold standard.  What will happen when we lose the oil standard?  
  
Inflation is coming.  With inflation comes decreased consumption and a scaling-back of companies’ production power.  And with that comes a devaluation of stock prices, and falling stocks.  
  
Which brings us to my final point:  Any financial instrument that derives value from rising stock prices and loss from falling prices will be a disaster for the party on the losing end.  
  
So invest carefully.

15-01-03,"Question about financial advisor's suggestion","I just got off a call with a financial advisor. She was suggesting that I roll over a part of my 401K to an IRA account for her firm to directly manager the funds.

She mentioned that she would charge around 0.89% of the directly managed funds. I felt that it is a better deal considering what I am paying in 401K as fees.

15-01-03,What is the difference between a simulated game and an actual online brokerage?,"When I am playing the stock market game from marketwatch, I noticed that some people make ridiculous earnings.

Not only this, but the top four people have over $1 mil. This is ridiculous because that would indicate that they should be billionaires in just a couple of years! Their earnings are over 1000%! Even though there are almost 2000 people playing that game, it just seems implausible to me. Additionally, I highly doubt that these people cheated by having multiple accounts.

15-01-03,How much would you pay for these hypothetical securities?,"The idea for this post comes from the most recent post on philosophicaleconomics.com, but please think about the questions before reading the post (EDIT: or the comments below) if you haven't seen it already.

Here are a three securities that you could buy. What is the most you would pay for each one?
I'll let the Philosophical Economist describe Security A:

&gt; Suppose that I have a security to sell you.  The security works as follows.  It pays out $10 in dividends per year.  The dividends grow at a real (inflation-adjusted) rate that ranges anywhere from 3% to 5% per year.  Of course, over the short-term, the dividends can grow at different rates–sometimes they can even grow at negative rates, i.e, fall.  But, crucially, over the very long-term, they always recover. They always regain their 3% to 5% long-term growth trendline.

&gt; Now, to avoid uncertainty, let’s assume that the aforementioned features of the security are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.  So there is essentially zero risk that the security will not behave  in the way that I just described.


However, there is a catch: **you can never sell Security A**. You can pass it on to your heirs or give it away if you want, but no one will ever pay you any money for it. I know this is unrealistic -- anything can be sold if you try hard enough -- but roll with it, okay?

So that is Security A.

Security B pays exactly the same dividend as Security A. In addition, the US government promises to allow you to redeem Security B, when you so choose, for 18.5 times the dividend paid that year. For example, this year, the dividend is $10, so you could redeem Security B for $185. But you are not allowed to sell Security B in any other way.

Finally, there is Security C, which is just like Security B, except you *are* allowed to sell Security C on the open market, at whatever price the market will bear.

So the question is, how what price would you pay for each of these securities? Please share your reasoning too.",0

15-01-03,NYMT - 15% dividend wtf? What am I missing?,"I did an ETF screener on Merrill Edge and found [NYMT](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=NYMT). 

All I care about is: 
a) will the price stay here / increase so I can recoup my money if I want to exit position? 

b) can they maintain paying this dividend? 15% is amazing 

If yes to both this seems like a nice deal. I reviewed their financial statements to confirm this and have the following observations:

* They're leveraged. They have a ton of debt and a ton of investment assets. 
* They recently sold stock and ton on additional debt according to cash flow statement.
* Their cash flow statement doesn't make much sense - decreases in investments are positive and increases in investments are negative.
* They have low cash, but believe that is by design since they're a REIT they have to payout.
* Earnings are stable per income statement so should be able to maintain dividend

Based on above they seem like an okay REIT (admittedly know nothing about REITS). Is 15% divided normal? That seems crazy high for an ETF that seems overall stable and able to maintain this. Am I looking at this right?

15-01-03,TSLA valuation reality check - comparison to other car manufacturers - thinking out loud,"This post is my thoughts out loud about why Tesla is valued as it is, and where it's going. Summary in bold at the bottom. My apologies if it's not easy to follow my ""logic"".


One way to valuate a stock is by comparison to other stocks in its industry. TSLA makes cars, so TSLA's valuation should be in keeping with the valuation of other car manufacturers. The ""big 3"" are Volkswagen ($219.06), GM ($34.84) and Toyota ($125.67).  TSLA is priced at $219.31.


Based on share price alone, TSLA is being valued as if it were Volkswagen. I'm just pointing this out, not really making a judgment. TSLA is priced at 6x GM, and less than 2x Toyota. Pricewise, the list is TSLA, VW, TM, GM (in order, highest to lowest).


Many other valuation methods use financials to valuate stock. If most negative financials were reflected in its stock price, TSLA would sell for far less than GM. TSLA alone has negative cash flow and negative net income, and many common financial ratios are based off those two statistics. So for purposes of this post, *""financials don't matter""*, except one. 


**The one financial area where TSLA shines is Revenue Growth, at 158.4.**


From a market standpoint, TSLA has its current market price due to that one metric, apparently. At the end of the day, it cost $219 to buy a share of Tesla and $35 to buy a share of GM. Today, correlation is causation.


The revenue growth rates for TM, GM and TSLA are 10.6, 4.7 and 158.4


Every point of growth for TSLA equates to $1.38 dollars of share price.

Every point of growth for TM equates to $12 of share price. 

Every point of growth for GM equates to $7.4 of share price. 


From the perspective of growth to share price, Toyota seems like the clear bargain. TM is better than GM is better than TSLA. VW, by the way, has no listed growth on the chart that I'm using, so, a big fat ""zero"" for them. 


The market values raw growth above any other factor in pricing car industry stock (apparently). Growth is King, except for VW, when it's not. VW, TM and GM are long term, stable companies.  The average growth for those three is (0 + 4.7 + 10.6)/3 = 5.1. The growth rate of TSLA should trend towards the average growth rate of the other three stocks as TSLA matures. TSLA's revenue growth will someday slow to 5.1. Since every point of growth in TSLA is reflected in a $1.38 dollar value, TSLA's value as it matures will trend towards 5.1 x 1.38 = $7. $7 is a little under their NAV.


**SUMMARY**:

Sooner or later, TSLA will be a $7 stock based on their growth rate and a comparison to other manufacturers in their market. Since TSLA's only redeeming feature is their growth rate, their long term viability is an ongoing concern. ",0
15-01-03,Should I sell my American Century TWGTX to move it over to Vanguard?,"Quite some time ago (at least 15 years ago if not longer) my father opened an account for me at AmCent and put $2500 into the GiftTrust fund (now called All Cap Growth - TWGTX).

Anyway, I've never added to it, it sits there making okay money and it's currently worth $6400 and change.  However, the management fee is 1%, plus they take out $25/yr for some other fee (probably some low balance account fee or some crap like that)

My questions are:

1. Am I better off just closing this account and moving this all to one of my Vanguard funds?

2. Can anyone guess how much of the $6400 will I have to pay taxes on, assuming I've already paid taxes on cap gains + dividends over the years?

I understand the basic investing concept that often risk is tied to return.

In the case of BMO, they take about 40 of these low-beta stocks.

I nearly shit a brick in surprise this afternoon when I looked into the one-year performance of ZLU and ZLB- a whopping 27% and 36%, respectively.

It's a volatility index that buys calls on the VIX, so as the market gets more volatile this stock shoots up.

I am actually not looking at a long hold so much as I am writing (selling/shorting) puts on this. Take a look at some of the option chains and you'll notice that this stock pays a crazy amount in option premiums, this is due to the volatility of UVXY itself, but when I look at say the march puts @ 24 $ strike price (current price 24.33) you can collect between $6.4-$7 in premiums which is a minimum a 26% put premium for a little over 2 months of holding it, it also gives you an effective buy price (17$) below the 52 week low.

I know the long term trend is downward, but I'm thinking even if the stock got assigned I could then write a call and receive a similar premium in a few months.

I know this certainly has some gambling aspects to it, but with the premiums being that high, it's a compelling situation. I figure if it does drop back to the 52 week low when it settles. I could buy another 100 shares and write the calls.

I'm only looking at writing 1-2 contracts so I'm not talking about a ton of money but I would love some insight on this from others.

One other note I should make is that I am actually a pretty regular covered call user, I like the investment strategy because it lets me sleep a little easier at night, but I'm actually looking at the UVXY as a way of hedging my limited upside potential from writing calls.

thanks,

I currently trade on Merrill Edge because it was an account given to me  by my father and I decided to use it to learn trading. The trades were $6.95/trade. I recently decided to invest up $6000 more and wanted to open up a new brokerage account that would be most profitable to me. The offer advertised at the link would give me $100 after I invest $3000 and execute 3 trades (which I was already planning on doing). 

I saw the aforementioned offer and I've read good things about Tradeking. What are your opinions on Tradeking? Are there any other offers/brokers out there that I should consider? I've also been looking at OptionsXpress and Option House. Any opinions on those? I just saw that TD Ameritrade was offering 6 months of free trading with $5000 investment but their regular trade price is $9.99, compared to Tradeking's $4.95. What about signing up for one broker and then moving your money to another one after the offer period is over? Has anyone tried this? 

I'm planning on trading mostly stocks with this new account, but if the brokerage offers good prices/tools to trade other types of investments, I'd consider doing that too.

Any advice would be appreciated.

15-01-05,Can you think of any other company that has the same brand loyalty as Apple?,"Loyalty or just plain obsession.

I can't really think of any other company, other than maybe an automotive brand like Ford or General Motors that people feel so strongly about. As an example, either you're a Ford guy or Chevy guy. Most are loyal to just one brand, and identify with it. 

I'm not an apple user, but I love the company from an investment standpoint. 

Apple users absolutely *love* their products. Roll out that watch, the car play, the ApplePay... these users will gladly buy it. 

Most if not all iPhone users I know (mostly women) will say the same thing when they see my Nexus phone, *""omg how can you not have an iPhone?""* I tell them how I've had iPhones before and I liked them, but I like the android phones better. I always ask them why they like their iPhone and most just say ""they're the best."" 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Coming back to my original question: Can you think of another company that has the same brand loyalty as Apple?

From all my positions in my portfolio I think Apple is such a no brainier. It's customers aren't going anywhere... and they want to buy anything you put in front of them.

As of today, I have roughly $130k in the bank. I purchased my home for $115k and am getting a loan for roughly $10k to make renovations, seeing as it's a foreclosure and has been gutted of all the copper in the home.

My initial plan with this home was to throw a large portion of my personal savings into the principal on my loan. However, a lot of my coworkers have been advising me that this may be foolish.

My APR on my home loan is 3.875% and the principal (including renovations) is roughly $125k. I had planned anyways to put $40k down bringing my loan total to $85k.

My question is as follows: would I be better off investing more in my principal to decrease my total loan amount? Or would it be wiser to take this money and instead invest it in the market? The logic being that I can earn a higher interest rate in the market than what my loan is growing at.

TLDR: Is it smarter to invest $80k towards the down payment on my home, or to invest $40k towards the home and then place $40k in the market?",0

15-01-05,Advice on what to do with some bonds/extra $$,"So that you all can have some context. I am a 22 yo fresh out of university with 3+ steady freelance jobs. Over the course of the past few months I have accumulated more $$ than I have ever had in my entire life and I am on the journey of what to do next. Below is my situation. 

401(k) plan with my union at 1 job that takes 5% of my check ~$25 a week. 

My liquid (~$10,000) is split as follows: 

1 CD at TD

1 Savings at TD

1 CD at BofA to cover my Credit Card

I have about ~15 bonds valued at around $2500 

I am currently living home and commuting to work in NYC/Stamford, CT so my monthly expenses are not too too crazy. I have a graduated student loan payment of about $170 a month but I am paying an additional ~$180 a month to bring down my highest interest loans. My parents want me to kick in $200 for the cost of the stuff they provide (insurance, roof, phone, utilities etc.) I will ball park and say that my monthly overhead with food/commute costs is ~$1000 a/mo which is easily manageable with my current employment. 

My real question here is should I liquidate the bonds then match the amount in cash on hand and invest it in 'X'? From my preliminary research, mostly from trolling this sub, I should put it in a Vanguard Roth IRA. Would this make sense from a long term planning perspective? I imagine the bonds I was given when I was born in 1992 wont be appreciating too much longer, or they aren't going to provide a preferable ROI that an investment will. 

My other thought is to keep the bonds as my safety net and then just take about $2-$3,000 liquid I have and start a Vanguard with that. Ultimately, I am in it for the long con, I don't think I can beat the market, not with my current lack of financial knowledge. I am going to peruse some suggested reading material ASAP but I want to make some moves sooner than later. ",0

15-01-04,Help me find a trading scheme that can destroy the stock market,"First of all - This is merely a thought experiment! I'm doing research for a story I'm trying to write down, and I'd like the mechanics involved to be economically sound which is why I'm seeking input.

- I have a malevolent protagonist with a lot of money - a big player that is capable of generating significant market impact if he brings all of his money to the game. He is also able to issue his own stocks if necessary (in other words, he himself could be a traded company). 

- The protagonists goal is to attract as much public money as possible to a given stock (could be stocks of his own company). Essentially, he is somehow creating an artificial bubble. Once he has amassed enough money, he lets the bubble burst and thus eliminates all money involved. Actually, he wants to collect and eliminate so much money that our whole financial system collapses (kind of like a second great depression).

- The Protagonist could have some other colluding parties.

- The protagonist is not the government (cannot print money)

- The protagonist is technically advanced and has the entire toolset of HTF and other fun gimmicks at hand. 

- The Protagonist does not care too much about laws. This does not mean that his scheme should be blatantly fraud. Rather, it should be sophisticated enough that once it is discovered its too late already. If someone can think of a perfectly legal scheme, even better so.

The scheme should be economically sound. But this does not mean that the markets are perfect. Actually, **it would be great if the scheme takes advantage of existing market failures, especially failures related to bounded rationality and behavioral irrationality of market players**. Something that takes advantage of classical human weakness. 

Anyone willing to engage in some brainstorming?

This prompted me to take a look at all my investment accounts and do a check-up on whether they are in the right places. 

The things that are important to me:  No annual or monthly fees.  Low commissions.  Investment choices Stocks, ETFs, NTF Mutual Funds, Free DRIP, Options.  I primarily invest in individual stocks, and index-based low expense ratio ETFs and Mutual Funds.  

Current Accounts:

* Roth IRA: WellsTrade 100 free trades per year, no annual fees, free DRIP, many NTF Mutual Funds.
* After Tax Investments: WellsTrade - same reasons.
* HSA: Just moved from TechCU and HSABank to WellsFargo.  No monthly fees, all money after the first $2000 automatically invested into no fee mutual funds (albeit limited selection). 

Do the above all make sense according my goals.  i.e. are there better accounts that accomplish what I want to do?

For my 401k rollover, WellsTrade no longer offers the 100 free trades for new accounts, they do however offer $6.95 stock trades.

I am debating WellsTrade vs Vanguard (Voyager level) for the rollover.  Are there any significant advantages of having my Traditional IRA at Vanguard instead of WellsTrade?  Is there another company I should look at?

Some background: In the past 3 years I came up with a quite successful investment strategy which lead to some great years. 
Now I am more frequently approached by friends and family who ask whether I could also help with their investments. Money is a tricky story and can quickly destroy long-term bonds which is why I do not want to handle their money directly.
Than I came across wikihow.com which offers anyone to set up a “fund“ which others can also invest into if they wish. As in a normal fund, the fund manager would get a small part of the ROE or earnings (5-30% depending on setup). 
Does anybody of you have any experienxes with this service? Looks to me like wikihow takes quite a big part of the margin. Any alternatives to this?

**Here's some financial info on myself.**
&gt;I'm 31 and I've got a savings account with just over $50,000, I put about $3000 into the account each month, I also have a Thrift Savings Plan with 10% of my paycheck being deducted every month, this has been going on for several years now. I can't touch the plan until I turn 60, so for me this is an account I don't pay much attention to.  I feel like my long-term plan is pretty secure but I could be wrong. As for bills, I only owe the bank for the mortgage on my house, everything else has been paid off. That's pretty much the me in quick paragraph.

&amp;nbsp;

**What I'm currently doing to be more aggressive:**
&gt;I've been thinking about using an app like Ameritrade or Etrader and putting some of my savings to good use.  I'm going to be practicing for several months with Ameritrade's thinkorswim app (paper money) to ensure I know what the hell I'm doing before dropping a significant amount of cash down.

15-01-05,Working on reallocating my lazy portfolios for 2015. Looking to see what you think of the advice I was given from an investor friend.,"30yr old, 55k/yr steady income, no debt except 15yr mortgage on 135k home.
I trust my investor friend a lot, but it's always interesting to get a second opinion.

I have two portfolios, one Roth IRA (Vanguard LifeStrategy Growth Fund 80/20 mix) at 23k, and a standard investment account (Vanguard Moderate Growth Fund) at 33k.

My friend thought they looked like good funds, but he thought international was a bit high, and thought that my investment account could afford to be a bit more aggressive, like somewhere between the Mod Growth fund and Growth fund.

I don't anticipate needing the funds for at least 5, or likely 10+ years. I'm being cautious to keep a good size emergency fund, but am planning for the potential need for when we have kids or a future home, or whatever else life brings down the road.
 

What do you think of this reallocation?

Total US Market Index (VTSAX): 58% (""admiral"", lower fees for 10k plus)

International Market (VGTSX): 12%

US Bond Index (VBMFX): 23%  

International bond index (VTIBX): 7%
  

Would you also consider reallocating the Roth IRA, or keep it slightly more aggressive where it's at? ",5

So I collected monthly S&amp;P and CPI inflation data since 1871. 

I calculated the forward 5-year real return for each month, adjusted for inflation, with reinvested dividends. 

I also calculated the percentage by which the index was currently below the record high at the time.

Those two values are not correlated to each other. On average, you can expect to get 7% real returns whether we are at a record high or whether we are 40% below it. ""Waiting for a dip"" doesn't improve your expected returns.

15-01-05,What do you think about the equity premium puzzle? Does it influence your thinking on stock/bond allocation?,"[Here's the Wikipedia article on it.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_premium_puzzle) Some quotes:

&gt; The equity premium puzzle refers to the phenomenon that observed returns on stocks over the past century are a few percent higher than returns on government bonds. It is a term coined by Rajnish Mehra and Edward C. Prescott in 1985. Economists expect arbitrage opportunities would reduce the difference in returns on these two investment opportunities to reflect the risk premium investors demand to invest in relatively more risky stocks.

&gt; ...

&gt; To quantify the level of risk aversion implied if these figures represented the expected outperformance of equities over bonds, investors would prefer a certain payoff of $51,300 to a 50/50 bet paying either $50,000 or $100,000.

&gt; The puzzle has led to an extensive research effort in both macroeconomics and finance. So far a range of useful theoretical tools and numerically plausible explanations have been presented, but no one solution is generally accepted by economists.

The article discusses various proposed solutions to the puzzle, but none seem particularly convincing. Some economists even think that it's just a statistical anomaly:

&gt; The most basic explanation is that there is no puzzle to explain: that there is no equity premium. This can be argued from a number of ways, all of them being different forms of the argument that we don't have enough statistical power to distinguish the equity premium from zero:

&gt; * Selection bias of the US market in studies. The US market was the most successful stock market in the 20th century. Other countries' markets displayed lower long-run returns (but still with positive equity premiums). Picking the best observation (US) from a sample leads to upwardly biased estimates of the premium.

&gt; * Survivorship bias of exchanges: exchanges often go bust (just as governments default; for example, Shanghai stock exchange during 1949 communist takeover), and this risk needs to be included – using only exchanges which have survived for the long-term overstates returns. Exchanges close often enough for this effect to matter.

&gt; * Low number of data points: the period 1900–2005 provides only 105 independent years which is not a large enough sample size to run statistical analyses with full confidence.

&gt; * Windowing: returns of equities (and relative returns) vary greatly depending on which points are included. Using data starting from the top of the market in 1929 or starting from the bottom of the market in 1932 (leading to estimates of equity premium of 1% lower per year), or ending at the top in 2000 (vs. bottom in 2002) or top in 2007 (vs. bottom in 2009 or beyond) completely change the overall conclusion. However, in all windows considered, the risk premium is always greater than zero.

&gt; A related criticism is that the apparent equity premium is an artifact of observing stock market bubbles in progress.

- Somehow, the account balance is now zero but I don't believe they are still charging me anything. I believe they normally charge for not maintaining a minimum balance, and although zero is not that balance, I suppose they don't or can't charge zero-balanced accounts. Correct? If I deposit, say, $1000 today, if the minimum is $1000, would they charge me anything if I used some of it for stocks? (so long as the net balance stays above $1000)

- I logged in finally and still have a stock it seems (maybe 2?) - .00347 shares (of each) or what looks like a dead stock, since it's only a number, and it is valued at 0.00 (one has a number, the other is just ""N/A""). How do I get rid of it? Can I? Should I?

- Is there some current online or downloadable spreadsheet template I can use to calculate fees, stocks, taxation, buy/sell figures, etc. or do have to build my own from scratch?

- Is it worth finding another online brokerage that's cheaper (fees, etc.) or is eTrade a trustworthy brokerage, still?

15-01-05,Best way to exit rental properites?,"My wife and I live in the Western USA, and got very lucky with our timing to pick up some rental properties.

We currently have three houses and are buying a fourth for our new primary home. Two have been rented for several years, and have tenants in place. We were incredibly lucky for the rentals and successfully timed the market to the absolute low. They are cash positive.

The existing three properties are all in the same neighborhood , which made it easy for me to manage them. Tenants have been great, with all properties pretty new no major items were ever needed.

I recently moved one to a property management company as a test to see how much it freed me up. After several months I found them to be rather pointless, and they provide a lower level of service to my tenants.

Financially, I think it would be best to hold onto them a few more years as the neighborhood is building out and a highway is on track to be built. However, if we exit them now we can pay off our new primary residence outright which I place a huge value on.

My question is, is there any advice to turn these properties? I am making the assumption that selling to an investor and keeping the tenants in place would be the best. Any advice as to how to find investors with enough capital?

15-01-05,Thoughts on my portfolio,"Hey guys, I have quite an extensive portfolio. Wanted to see what you guys think (I'm not that experienced, only 21 years old). I'll list the symbol and the price at which I bought:

TSLA - 44.32

15-01-06,Psychologically overcoming a bad trade/investment,"Hi All,

I recently began investing in stocks actively. I had invested before, but over many years and in big name stocks, and therefore never really lost. This year I became more active and made a few bad trades where I lost 30%+. This was new to me and really made me feel bad. It made me think about just reverting to passive long-term investing. Luckily I didn't lose overall, as one of my trades made me a lot just by sheer luck (a put on NFLX before its big fall). 

I feel like a lot of my almost trades ended up being huge gainers (I was set to buy Talisman Energy the morning after it was trading at 3.50ish, but it opened up huge due to being bought out). Others did similar. The ones that I pulled the trigger on didn't perform as well as those that I didn't pull the trigger on, which was frustrating.

After a bad trade, what do you do? I am lucky that I didn't lose a lot, and overall did fine. But I feel kind of like once burned twice shy. I am trigger shy. I feel much better about just throwing $ into BP or PM and letting it sit for years, instead of actively trading something riskier that is on my radar like RSX or CVEO.

Anyone want to throw in their two cents?",1

15-01-05,Inherited IRA - does it require a different strategy?,"Just wondering if any of you are dealing with a non-spouse inherited/beneficiary IRA. I am in this situation and I am wondering if all the normal rules apply (stay invested, don't time market, rebalance periodically)

With this type of account, I am required to take money out each year... and the amount will increase every single year. This means I only have partial control of when to sell investments (I have to sell some each year in order to take money out) whether the market is good or bad - even now, way before retirement.  So, where the normal advice is to start aggressive and gradually move to bonds as you approach retirement, I am wondering if that still makes sense for me.

Would also appreciate any advice on what is best to do with the money I am required to take out, once it becomes enough that I don't need all of it. Should I be putting that back into a personal IRA or a taxable account?

I am 34 so the required distributions are still fairly small but they will eventually get big.",7

I am currently in my final year studying undergrad finance at university in Australia. A few friends of mine are interested in starting an investment portfolio for learning purposes and for something to talk about in future interviews and so on. 

I want to know how you guys began trading and some stories/advice about your successes or failures and what you would have done differently if you could. 

e.g. Were you guys doing valuations for every company to determine which ones were ""valuable""/underpriced?

Generally speaking, what type of screens were you using to find valuable companies? (by industry, market cap, size, PE/other ratio, volume, other)

How much money do you think is a suitable amount to begin a portfolio taking into account brokerage and other fees?

How important is diversification at the start?

Are there any useful free websites that give good market insight?

15-01-05,Questions about investing,"Hello everyone, got a couple questions for you and would like to hear your thoughts. 
  
My first question is this, I have an IRA account that I've been maxing out every year. So far there is about $11,500 in it. My portfolio for my IRA is as follows: 83% US Brd MKT ETF, 12% Intl EQ ETF, 5% US AGG BND ETF. I know this is risky, but I am 24 and I want to be risky. So my question is this, with my next IRA contribution would it be smart to put 100% of my contribution into a dividend ETF? I figure that getting something that gives me regular dividends will have a greater effect over the next 35.5 years of my life.
  
My second question is this. I recently inherited a stock account from my grandparents (the stock account has been in my name since I was born, so it wasn't gifted). This stock account pays off about $6,500 in dividends each year. Would it be possible to transfer some of the stocks there into my IRA so the dividends wouldn't be taxable?
  
And my third question is this. If I could transfer stocks into my IRA would that amount be considered my IRA contribution, or would I still be able to make the $5,500 contribution?

Thanks!!!",1

15-01-05,Looking for a review of a modified lazy portfolio,"I want a lazy low cost portfolio, but most of the ones I read about are either too ""simple"" (not diversified among asset classes that I want) or too complex (trying to juggle small/med/large cap, or developed/emerging/europe/asia/etc).

So I came up with the following that is based on the simple lazy portfolios, but adds in US and INTL REITs, INTL bonds, and TIPS, all for the purposes of maximum diversification while still trying to stay as simple/lazy as possible.

Can you please review it?

* 50% VTI (Total US stock market)
* 20% VXUS (Total INTL stock market)
* 10% BND (Total US bond market)
* 5% VNQ (US REIT)
* 5% BNDX (INTL bonds)
* 5% SCHP (US TIPS bonds)
* 5% VNQI (INTL REIT)

A few notes:

* I am pretty young, so 70/20/10 (stock/bond/reit) seems OK to me.
* Do the proportions of US vs. international look reasonable?
* Do the choices of vehicles look good, assuming I am looking for the lowest cost choice to serve each asset class?
* Is my choice to add the 3 last funds a sound one, or am I over-analyzing this?  If I wanted to simplify it toward the standard lazy portfolios, I guess I would do: 50% VTI, 20% VXUS, 20% BND, 10% VNQ.  But I liked adding the other 3 as added diversification - I guess this is really my question here - is that a good idea?",8

15-01-06,I am looking to invest in oil once the price per barrel comes down to about $40. Can someone take a look at the stocks I have narrowed it down to and give me some guidance.,"I, like many others, see the near future as a good time to invest oil. I have heard lots of talk about ETF's, leverged ETF's, and ETN's. Due to beta decay and my interest in a mid-term investment (3-6 months), I have been searching for a low-debt, decent P/E, high EPS, mid-beta, fundamentally sound, oil company. I have narrowed it down to  three possibilities. These include: Dril-Quip Inc. (DRQ), Western Refining Logistics (WNRL), and Eni Spa (E). My only reservation about Eni Spa is the fact that it is an Italian company; considering the state of the European economy this scares me. At the same time, it does appear to be a great stock managed by a very well-run and profitable company. If someone could take the time to confirm or deny my suspicions that would be great. Thank you in advance.

15-01-06,Starting out small and a unique situation.,"I am in a position where my real job (one that pays the bills) is something I do from home and I have a fun part time job I work only because I like working for the company and it's how I relax (weird I know). I would like to setup an investment account with seed money of $1,000 and then just have My fun job paycheck, It's usually around $1-200 a week, deposited directly into the investment account. I am looking to maintain access to this money so I'm not looking at retirement accounts.  It also wouldn't be the end of the world if I lost the money completely so I do plan to making high risk investments in individual stocks. 

My question is how should I approach this? I know what I want to invest in and I know I want to maintain control but I don't want to be eaten alive by fees.  My thoughts were to let the money build in the account and make purchases once a month or every other month.  Is there a way to automate this?  I don't plan on selling stocks for 5 years unless a specific stock warrants it.  

Disclaimer: I did check out the links on the sidebar but Unless I missed something I didn't find anything I could adapt to my situation.

I just wanted to run something by you...

Right now im well diversified in small - large caps through my 401k but im holding about 30k in personal cash.


I live in a large inefficient house and travel a VERY far distance to work every day. Oil is the biggest expense in my life because of home heating and gas.


I was thinking of taking 10k and dumping it into $NYSE:OIL or $USO tomorrow just as a hedge. If the oil prices continue to drop, i actually make money in my life because I would save so much every year on gas / oil. If the oil prices skyrocket back to July levels, i will continue to suffer with my home oil / gas issues but Ill be 10k richer.

15-01-05,Question about Transferring Stock/Tax/IRA,"Hello everyone, got a couple questions for you and would like to hear your thoughts. 

My first question is this, I have an IRA account that I've been maxing out every year. So far there is about $11,500 in it. My portfolio for my IRA is as follows: 83% US Brd MKT ETF, 12% Intl EQ ETF, 5% US AGG BND ETF. I know this is risky, but I am 24 and I want to be risky. So my question is this, with my next IRA contribution would it be smart to put 100% of my contribution into a dividend ETF? I figure that getting something that gives me regular dividends will have a greater effect over the next 35.5 years of my life.

My second question is this. I recently inherited a stock account from my grandparents (the stock account has been in my name since I was born, so it wasn't gifted). This stock account pays off about $6,500 in dividends each year. Would it be possible to transfer some of the stocks there into my IRA so the dividends wouldn't be taxable?

And my third question is this. If I could transfer stocks into my IRA would that amount be considered my IRA contribution, or would I still be able to make the $5,500 contribution?

Thanks!!!

15-01-06,Account types.,"I'm 16 and have been trading on my grandmas Roth IRA for about three years now. I am now pretty well educated on buy and sell type trades as well as the analysis side of things. I am looking to make a bit more money and as you know I'm limited to to my trading frequency on the IRA. My grandma, the person who introduced me to trading, won't set up a new account for me because she doesn't  want the money I make to show up when I apply for college loans/scholarships. Is there an account type that I could trade under that wouldn't show up as my money. If I made one under my parents name I'm pretty sure it would still be considered my money in terms of college financial terms, since they are the ones paying for my college education. 

Also, I am looking to start trading options. I have educated my self fairly well and I feel that I am prepared to make a profit without being in the dark. What are the limitations for options trading on a Roth IRA?

To show I'm ready:

In 2014 I made a 400%+ return on my original portfolio. (in the IRA) A lot of that came from me buying tesla at 50 range and selling at around 260. Other gains came from NOBL, BABA, APPL, LAKE.

15-01-05,My analysis of AAPL,"AAPL stock is $106.25 right now. I place a fair market value of $105.58 on AAPL based on their slightly underperforming yield of 5.44%. The floor for them is $96.90, with a ceiling of $116.11. 


Apple's intrinsic value is dimmed substantially by its close current ratio this past quarter (9/2014). Their positive residuals, free cash flow and net income are excellent, however. 


From a technical standpoint, it's the fourth day of big black candles for them. The current candle is resting on the bottom of a Bollinger band. It's hard to tell if the MACD is bottoming out or not. Based on my reading of their weekly candle chart, APPL has just ""corrected down"" to the center these past two weeks. 


AAPL is a puzzle. While it is fairly valued at $105.3, a buyer might be smart to wait for a bounce at $96.90. However, past behavior suggests that APPL might fall only one more candle down tomorrow, turning white in the process. This past year, similar movement has been followed by a strong upside. That pattern is *highly* speculative on my part.


My overall recommendation is ""Hold"" until midday tomorrow. If APPL continues to fall, it could find a new home in the $96-$102 range (bad news if you bought higher). If the candle is lower but white, that seems like a ""buy"" signal. 


I will not be buying AAPL in either case (due to insufficient funds).",0

15-01-06,"TIL: In the Early 1980's, Discoveries of Oil in the North Sea and Alaska Collapsed the Price of oil by 65%.","Found this little gem while watching a documentary called The Prize. Just a little background history, prior to the North Sea and North Slope finds, OPEC was able to effectively set the price of oil and they did that by reducing supplies. During the Iranian revolution (1979), oil production from Iran collapsed and world production dropped by 4%. This gave OPEC a huge upper hand in terms of setting oil prices and they used their production to make oil prices high. The price of oil had risen to $39/barrel. During the 1980s there was a huge need to find and develop non-opec fields. These fields were developed in Alaska and the North Sea. This is referred to as the 1980s oil glut.

Also the documentary starts by talking about, ""falling demand."" They are talking about the falling demand for OPEC's oil.

I've currently finished Year 11 and looking to go into Finance+Law anyways so this would be great for me to get started as well.

There's also big concerns that my mum raises that me, my elder brother and younger sister should all have trust funds so we don;t have to worry about money. Now we're not spoiled or anything and i personally know that my father has keenly discussed trust funds for us which would pay 3-5k a month and NOT MORE so I don't want any advice that would be making us trust fund babies with 10k per month payouts. Do you think trust funds are a good idea? My elder brother is going to uni this year doing medicine, I'll be going to uni next year doing Law+Finance Little sister is in year 8 still living her life :)

Mum always says we should look at getting property in rural areas and have a ranch or a vineyard or something of the sorts but my dad is strictly against buying property solely as a business investment at the moment, we live in a house in Toorak and he has in investment property in the Docks and he thinks the markets currently in a bubble so it's all going to crash so no point investing in property.

So tell me guys what would you advise and what can I advise him?

TL;DR Dad's a surgeon makes about half a mill a year. has 1 house in toorak 1 appartment in the docks and no other investments and mum keeps complaining that he should think about retirement and the future of his kids",0

15-01-06,Will a increasing use of index funds eventually cause or perhaps prevent a future market crash?,"*disclaimer: I really have no idea what I am talking about. (Newguy)

After reading though his paper (I just stumbled upon it) , I did a quick search on /r/investing for a discussion and couldn't find a previous post with 'Jeffrey Wurgler'. Mayhaps the overarching consequences of index funds could be an interesting discussion?  I have been generally reading a sentiment that 'index=good' on here as of late. 

* Wurgler's paper [ON THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF INDEX-LINKED INVESTING]( http://www.nber.org/papers/w16376.pdf)

* [TL;DR article](http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2010/09/22/349586/did-nobody-ever-consider-that-indexing-was-dangerous/)

* another potentially relevant paper: [Regression Discontinuity and
the Price Effects of Stock Market Indexing](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2288184)

Seems that the basic assumptions are: 

* The amount of index fund $ is increasing exponentially over time - I believe the paper references ~9$ trillion (in 2010)

* Indexed stocks react significantly different from non-indexed stocks in the market once indexed

What do you believe are the implications? How is this changing the market?

Are all indexed stock being inflated? Is the market becoming more artificial? 

Could the increase of market index trading be hiding a looming market slowdown/crash - perhaps visible in the few dips with rapid recoveries in the last months? 

Or, can the proliferation of indexing help us weather changes in the market going forward in a good way? Is it possible we are becoming more crash proofed with a potential for increasingly rapid high volume rebounds with less scrambling and yelling everyone - even in big crashes?

Am I way off the mark? 

Perhaps an ELI5 style discussion could help with some insights. 
But yeah! Generally interesting article either way.
 
Cheers!

My year was lackluster.  My investments (excluding money set aside for my home down-payment) returned a solid 26% for 2013.  I pretty much just rolled most of the performers right into 2014.  But that left me over invested in both pharma and in energy, which got hit last year.  So for 2014 I returned a pretty measly 3%, much of which just got wiped out in the past 2 days.  

I have been bullish for the last couple years and looking back I realized that I hadn't been rebalancing as actively as I should.  So my plan for 2015 is to slowly divest from some of the more volatile sectors move into some more conservative areas.  Right now I don't have any bonds or bond funds.  Now that we've been hitting new highs in the last month my plan for the first part of 2015 is to reduce the overall risk in my portfolio.  I'm still bullish, but want to move from 100% equities to something like 15-20% bonds over the quarter.

Download the beginner friendly ebook [10 Keys to successful trading] (http://instantbinaryprofit.com/go/10-keys-to-successful-trading/)

**Types of Brokers**
There are basically two types of brokers in America, ie full-service brokers and discount brokers. The full-service brokers offer much more support for customer and discount brokers - especially providing analysis and research reports, business tips, offering assistance and guidance in specific trades and so on. However, the customer has to pay more for these services, which means that full-service brokers charge much higher fees for their services at discount brokers. But choosing a full service broker may be convenient for people who are starting in the market and often need a lot of tips and answers to your questions. Some of the largest banks act as full-service brokers for their clients.

Although for most traders, choosing a discount broker seems to be a better alternative. Especially for those who do their analysis themselves and rarely need telephone support during the day. Because discount brokers usually do not do their own research and offer fewer services than full-service brokers, they can charge their customers much lower commissions. When you trade through a discount broker, the customer places their trades in a computer application that sends agent via internet. That is why the time of execution of operations is much shorter than if a transaction is placed through a phone call - which is another plus. Some discount brokers are known such Interactive [24option] (http://option.go2jump.org/SHOoyi), [AvaTrade](http://www.avatrade.com/lp/digital-currencies?tag=52807&amp;tag2=~banner_8892), or [Grand Option](http://option.go2jump.org/SHPEp2).

There are several things to consider when choosing a broker.They are:

**Markets**
The most important is that the broker should be allowed to trade in the markets in which we are interested. Main brokers offer trading in virtually all US markets and exchanges.

**Maintenance Fee**
There are two basic things to your broker may charge you. The first is a set for account maintenance fee - you pay if you operate or not. The second thing you pay your broker is paid a commission for each transaction you make. Discount brokers typically do not charge any maintenance fees.

**Commission action**
However, there are great differences between them regarding the transaction fees. Some brokers provide trade commission according to the number of shares that are involved in trade. These corridors are the most convenient for investors and traders who trade stocks in smaller volumes (usually less than 1,000 vines per trade). [24option] (http://option.go2jump.org/SHOoyi) or  [Grand Option](http://option.go2jump.org/SHPEp2) set their fees this way.

**Transaction fee**
On the other hand, there are brokers offering the same price for a trade regardless of the number of shares involved in trade (called flat rate). These fees are equipped SogoTrade example, E * Trade or Scottrade These corridors are suitable for traders (or investors) who sell larger volumes (over 1,000 vines per trade).

**Inactivity Fee**
However, some brokers have to be aware of the fact that if you do a minimal amount of operations for a certain period, automatically be charged an inactivity fee, for example, Interactive Brokers or TradeStation.

**Minimum deposit**
Also, another thing to consider is that most brokers do require a certain minimum deposit to open an account. It is usually several thousand dollars. Although, there are even brokers require a minimum deposit of $ 1, and thus, in fact, require no minimum deposit is placed.

**Types of Traders**
Now, let's go over the different categories of retailers and find the most suitable for them runners.

**Swing trade**
This type of traders leaves open positions for several days. The most important factor they consider is the transaction fee (because they make a lot of trades per month). The execution speed of operation is also important for them, but is not as important as it is for day traders because swing traders leave their positions open longer. On the other hand, account maintenance fees are not important for these people. It is also important that these traders have access to real-time data on prices and trading volumes of his runners, but these are now provided by virtually every major corridors.
Suitable for swing traders Brokers: Interactive Brokers, SogoTrade, Just2Trade
Suitable Brokers For Swing-trading on margin: Interactive Brokers, Just2Trade (offer low margin rates)

**Day Trader / Scalper**
These traders open for a couple of minutes to a few hours and almost never leaves open positions overnight. Timely execution of operations is essential for these traders - in order to prevent slippage (a situation where market order is filled at a worse price is the price that has been introduced in). Another need is accurate, real-time price and trading volume information. It is advantageous that the broker provides more detailed data, such detailed order book. Moreover, it is useful if the broker offers market news in real time, which can relay e.g Reuters. Day traders often make dozens or sometimes even hundreds of transactions each month with high volumes, which often benefit from flat rates. Be aware of the fact that trading day in the US is allowed only to accounts with a balance greater than $ 25,000. Traders with a lower balance can make only a limited amount of daily operations.
Suitable for day traders Brokers: [24option] (http://option.go2jump.org/SHOoyi) or  [Grand Option](http://option.go2jump.org/SHPEp2) or [Ataraxia 7](http://tuhin2233.ataraxia7.cpa.clicksure.com)


**Small Investor / Trader**
Investors with capital of less than $ 5,000 have much less choice when selecting a broker. Most brokers require a certain minimum deposit that the customer has to do in order to open an account. This amount usually ranges from $ 2,000 to $ 15,000. For a small investment, both commissions for trades and maintenance fees and other expenses (eg, inactivity fees, fees for wire transfers, etc.) are very important because they greatly affect their overall performance. For small investors, agents with very low commissions are best suited although not offer much of a customer support.

**Investor**
Investors, traders compared to the relatively rare trade. Usually, after opening the account, buy a stock portfolio, they see and once in a given period (usually once a year) rebalancing - or add special populations and eliminate others. Such people do not need the best execution, as the slide is very insignificant to them as they tend to keep their stocks for several years. It also is not as important the amount of commission paid for the particular trade, as compared with traders, trading little. However, it is important whether they pay a maintenance fee to your broker, as if they could be subject to dormancy fees if they do not change for a longer time. That is why it is better for them to choose a broker that does not charge a fee for inactivity although it can charge higher fees for merchants. Many investors may also require a certain level of customer service from your agent, especially receiving research reports on the market.

**Free Trading Signals**
Today automated trading is most popular trading strategy. A large number of beginner traders search for these kind of software. These softwares are mainly copy the signals of some pro traders. That means, these software can give you the most profitable signals for a short time trading. Basically these automated softwares are joint with some brokers. You just need to choose the best software from the market and deposit some money to their broker. The minimum deposit amount is around $250 to $1000. You can start from small deposit.

Okay, so I'm in the Air Force and had a baby four months ago and I also have the post 9-11 GI Bill which gives me the option of passing that onto my children which would, in a nutshell, pay for their college for four years.  I'm not planning on having more than one child but that could always change of course.  If I have another kid I am able to split up my GI Bill between the two of them so they could have 2 years of school paid for each.

So I'd like to start saving up for my kid just in case we have to split up the GI bill or if he wants to pursue a masters/further education or if he's dumb and it takes him 8 years to graduate.  I was researching different ways to save up and came across the 529 plan which from what I understand would cause me to have a 10% tax penalty if I do not end up using it to pay for my kids school.  I was also researching doing a Roth IRA but I'm going to be honest, I have no idea what I'm doing.  Could anyone point me in the right direction or give me some good advice on what the best way to save up would be?  Since my kid will have the GI Bill I'm not planning on making a huge investment into a separate college fund, I'm thinking like $2400 a year, just something a little extra down the road and if we need it to pay for school we can do that or if I'm in my 50's at this point and want to blow it on a convertible to make up for bald head and erectile dysfunction.

One additional question I have is about price growth: For example, gold has increased from $30 per ounce to over $1000 per ounce since 1950, and the S&amp;P has grown from 16 pts to 2000 pts.

15-01-06,Buying real-estate with equity -- good or bad idea?,"Hello redditors,

I'm a long time lurker using a throw away account.  I'm looking for some candid advice or ideas with how I'm investing my (soon to be growing) wealth.  To set the stage with where I'm at financially and in life:

-I'm single, male, in my late 20's with no kids.  There is a girl in the picture, but marriage has not been discussed yet and would be a ways off.  She is also at the top of her field in a very lucrative career, so money is not really an issue for her.

-I currently have a full time job, own a small business and own 3 (soon to be 4) houses in a city that are rented with a good positive cash flow.  This all totals between 80k - 90k in income / yearly.  I max out my company stock options and 401K, and rent a nice house but live well below my means.  I have anywhere from $500 - $1000 cash that I feel free to spend or save every month after basics are taken care of.

-Of the properties I own, one has around 125k equity in it.  Together, the others have another 75k in equity.  My father's house is completely paid off, and he has offered to ""loan"" me some equity from that, probably not more than 75k.

-My credit rating is between 770 and 820 depending on which CRA you ask.  I carry no student loan debt, no credit card debt with a line of credit about 20k, and a small car payment of 236.  I currently have about 40k of company stock that I could sell at any given time.

Now, for what I'd like to do and need someone to talk me into or out of it:

I would like to pull equity from my properties and potentially my father's for a HELOC and use this to purchase a property with ""cash"" at below market value, most likely a foreclosure or a house that needs cosmetic updating.  I would put in the cash to modernize or fix anything it needed, and then immediately take out a mortgage on it and rent it out.  My thinking is that the original investment is then made back, and now I have a positive cash flow of $500 - $1000 / month from that one house.  Then, I would plan to do it again.  

My real-estate agent and close friend has done this with his parent's HELOC and done quite well.  I've already confirmed that a bank would mortgage another house to me based on my income and rent history in the past.

So, reddit, please tell me why this is a good or a bad idea?  What else should I be considering?  What are some things that I may have missed? 

tl;dr:  I want to take equity from a house I own, use it to buy another house, rent that and mortgage it to make the initial investment back.

Thanks

I'm angry as hell at the Bosses in big businesses who don't do like real Bosses who do what's right for the employees and the people who Own the Company.

I'mma just call 'em GTAT Solar Company, Management team been acting like some damn scoundrels! GTAT Solar Company's is owned by everyday people like you and I who hustle for our money, and put it in the stock market so it grows,

Everyday people who put it into businesses that we believe are gonna make money. Man I'm pissed off cuz now I'mma be going to New Hampshire, all the way from Florida, to Court on January 26th to fight for the employees and investors. I tell you what, I'm gonna stand in Court like Cramer faces down the studio camera, I'm writing and moving people like JK Rowling, and, I'm Loving people like Tony Robbins. I'm angry as hell cuz GTAT Solar Company employees are every day folk and they need good Bosses! No more bad management man that **** hurts our wallets you know!?

Gotta toss out bad management like a pit boss tosses out cheating-ass fools at the blackjack table!

Damn I'm angry. I got the idea to write this from a breakfast show on the radio..lol

Anyway there's a lot to this case with GTATQ who entered restructuring after a Contract with Apple, Inc nearly put them out of business.

But the following sums up the history a bit..

The Solar industry is known to be cyclical. GTAT is an equipment manufacturer. Its a given its a cyclical business.

Going into and through summer 2013 GTAT had what? 200 million plus dollars to use on their continuing R&amp;D that they knew was going to take through 2014 to complete.

Instead of waiting it out and hustling with tight expense controls, like a normal cyclical business, GTAT Management chose to enter an extremely low-profit return Contract with URGENT terms with inadequate time for them to enter into a business which they had little direct experience in (sapphire material production on massive scale). With EXCLUSIVE terms which prevented the Company's largest and most profitable division (ASF Sapphire Furnaces &amp; Equipment) while they risked it all for investors, they sold tens of millions of dollars of equity.

When they knew the contractual terms were insane the whole way through, from day 0 of the completion of negotiations with Apple!

15-01-07,"LS vs. DCA (and others): Backtesting 30-year periods of S&amp;P 500 data from 1951-2013","There is always discussion about LS vs. DCA on this sub and most of us refer to the [Vangaurd Study](https://pressroom.vanguard.com/content/nonindexed/7.23.2012_Dollar-cost_Averaging.pdf) that found LS is better 67% of the time. Great information, but I was curious to test these methods against other scenarios and alter the conditions a bit. For example, using 30 year periods (rather than 10) to simulate an S&amp;P 500 portfolio (instead of total US assets) using 5k annual buy-ins (instead of 1m windfall). You all have helped point me in the right direction for useful information as I've continued to learn about investing and I wanted to post this here in return. 


**Assumptions:**


$5000 cash is deposited into brokerage at beginning of each year (like an IRA)


Dividends are paid monthly (end of month), per source (below) 


‘Shares’ of S&amp;P are bought for the average of the days start and close price


‘Shares’ can be bought in fractions


‘Shares’ are not sold or rebalanced with another index 


No trading fees


Real S&amp;P ETFs will track gains/losses with negligible divergence 


Cash does not accrue interest


**Scenarios:**


(1) Buy $5000 on first day of each year (LS)


(2) Buy $416* on first day of each month (DCA)


(3) Buy with available funds if previous close is 1 year low (1YR-LOW)


(4) Buy with available funds if previous close is 5% from maximum (5PC-LOSS) 


*\Actually 416.666667


**Additional Clarifications:**


(A) The 5% loss scenario keeps track of the historical maximum and will purchase at each additional 5% loss. So if the maximum does not change, the buy signal will be 'Yes' at -5%, -10%, and so on.


(B) The analysis was run twice. Once when dividends are automatically reinvested each month and once when dividends are held in cash until the next buy signal for each scenario.  


(C) Each scenario (and both analysis types) were run for rolling 30-year historical periods of S&amp;P 500 data from 1951-2013 (i.e. 1951-1980, 1952-1981, ect). There are 34 rolling 30-year periods during that time, each period will have a final portfolio value output that can be compared. All code written in matlab. 


**Results:**


Attached are 4 graphs.

**Edit:** I dont think the links are working directly to each image (not on mobile at least) need to click through the four image album. 



**Findings:**


I think basically the scenario's weigh the trade-off between value from dividends (the sooner you invest the more they compound) and value from growth (waiting for dips to invest at a discount). In most cases time in the market (dividend compounding) beats timing the market (waiting for better growth potential). The scenarios for buying lower (3&amp;4) do not have buy-in signals frequently enough to take advantage of compounding dividends. Also, automatic dividend reinvestment showed higher total portfolio value compared to investing dividends at the next buy-in signal overall.


Between lump-sum and dollar cost averaging methods, LS wins 67% of the time when dividends are not automatically reinvested. This is basically the same finding that a [Vangaurd study found](https://pressroom.vanguard.com/content/nonindexed/7.23.2012_Dollar-cost_Averaging.pdf). Although, this study did not attempt to identify the conditions that would make DCA more likely to win. I found that 30-year periods that begun with a Shiller P/E &gt; 18 were WAY more likely to favor DCA investing. This makes sense considering high Shiller P/E indicates a potentially overvalued market which may subsequently drop to allow cheaper, near-term DCA buy-ins. 


I think the worst assumption here is that cash does not accrue interest. It's more reasonable that cash gets an annual 0-3% based on money market rates. I wasn't able to find data on this, but still looking. It may be that cash interest helps other methods with fewer buy-ins gain value, but I doubt it would make up for the large difference in total ending value.


Interesting stuff! In the next phase I will be combining buy signals. For example, using the lump-sum to invest 80-90% of annual funds and then 5% dip signals for the remaining 10-20% funds. The first one I tried (90% lump sum, 10% dips) beat the lump-sum method most 30-year periods. Curious to hear if you have any ideas to try or something I may have missed. I've included the links to data I used below. 


**Data:**

I am not a financial adviser, by background is in engineering and data analytics, please do your own due diligence! Also obligatory past performance does not guarantee future returns.

And there's also a load of interesting action in the gold and silver markets. 

In 2014, silver fell back again, with another 18% loss to the 30% drop of 2013. 

Silver is currently finding greater demand from use in industry and electronics, while gold's primary value remains as a store of wealth and an asset against other investment types. 

Currently it takes 75 ounces of silver to buy one ounce of gold. The ratio was 61 ounces to one ounce of gold back at the start of 2014. You could read this as a trend to that says storing wealth has become more highly prized versus industrial use. In other words not such great news for  stock market investments (lower growth ahead), the price of corporate bonds (deflation means debt defaults) or, indeed, for silver.

The gold/silver ratio is now near its highest level of the last 20 years...and it has tended to peak just when things turn pretty gruesome: like the Dot Com crash and the Lehman Brothers collapse.

15-01-06,Why do people think low oil prices could last for years?,"I'm looking for someone to play devils advocate before I invest in any oil stocks.

Currently, the world is oversupplied in oil because demand hasn't fully materialized and high prices have lead to the development of nontraditional sources: Sand, Shale, Deep Water. Additionally, supply has increased in unstable countries that were previously halted: Iraq, Libya, etc. Furthermore, OPEC has seemingly broken down by refusing to cut production.

Most of the increased supply can be attributed to new nontraditional oil sources. The cost for creating new wells at nontraditional plays is conservatively around $70 on average if you want a return that justify your risk. At the current price of oil the only new profitable supply will be in traditional light crude or existing wells that haven't reached full production. All oil plays eventually decline but tight oil has a especially short lifespan of roughly 50%-75% total production in it's first year.

This means for sustained oil prices below $70 low cost producers have to increase production in order to offset the decline in production from nontraditional oil plays. The only way I can see this happening is if OPEC stays disbanded, that historically volatile countries become more stable and that the global demand for oil doesn't significantly increase from current levels.

I don't see how it's in OPEC's best interest to disband. I don't think low oil prices will make historically volatile countries any less volatile and I don't see the demand for oil decreasing for many years.

While some high cost producers may go insolvent I can't possibly see how oil prices can stay at these levels for more than 1 year. What am I missing?",65
15-01-07,ESPP and Stock Option Plan questions.,"Looked through the FAQ and could not find what I needed. I posted today in /r/personalfinance, had an online chat with a Fidelity representative, and am now left with additional questions and few answers. This is what I posted in PF:

I am participating in an ESPP. The purchase date is every quarter, discount is 5%, and there is no minimum holding period. Great, I thought, with virtually no risk, I can make 5% on a portion of my paycheck four times a year.
So the plan purchased 2 shares of WFM at $46 the other day. I would like to immediately sell this to realize the gain. However, every time I try to initiate the market order, the order includes a $35 commission fee. I don't know why the commission is listed at $35, I cannot find a reference for that anywhere on Fidelity's website. All I can find is that there is a $7.95 fee for online trades, and a $32.95 fee for representative assistance. So where does that $35 come from? I'm slightly upset that I seemingly cannot sell without taking a 30-35% loss.

This is what the Fidelity dude had to say to me in my online chat:

Rep: I am sorry that the commission for selling your WFM stock is more than you expected. The commissions for trading your company stock is a negotiated rate by your company with Fidelity. Trading other stocks in your account will just have the normal online rate of $7.95.
Rep: Companies often negotiate a higher commission rate for company stock plans to cover the cost of administering the plan.
Rep: For more information about this, please contact our Stock Plan department at 800-544-9354.
Me: the shares are not in my ESPP plan, when they are purchased they are placed in my individual brokerage account. I guess I don't understand what WFM has to do with my personal assets at that point
Rep: I understand what you are saying. I don't know quite how to address your concern there. The Individual account is linked to your stock plan account for the purpose of redeeming your stocks from the plan and there is a negotiated commission to sell them once they are in your Individual account.

----

I read through my company's ESPP document and it seems to me that even though the two shares are in my brokerage account, they are treated as stock options that become qualified in two years. 

That got me thinking about the stock options I was granted last May. I was granted 36 options in May 2014, and nine of them vest each year. The first nine will become vested this coming May, until they are all vested in 2018. The expiration date is May 2021. The option price is around $37, and the stock currently trades for about $49.

I have a general understanding about how options work. I understand that if I exercise the 9 options that vest in May, it will be like buying and then immediately selling, and I'll make the $12/share difference in the price.

I was wondering if someone could better explain how my ESPP actually works. I have always heard that ESPPs are ""no-brainers,"" but I cannot currently sell without taking a 33% loss. I do not even really understand what happens in two years either; I guess the $35 commission is replaced with a $7.95 online trade fee. But the addition of two years adds a lot of risk to what I thought was supposed to be risk-free.

Also, if I am risk-adverse, what is the financially responsible thing to do in May? I've heard that I should exercise each May, but I've also heard that if I wait 1.5 years, the gain is taxed as long-term capital gains which would result in savings. The options were given to me for free, so I wouldn't mind holding if it results in more money. At that point, would waiting until 2021 be the best course of action? More time in the market should result in more money, and I haven't actually invested anything. 

The ESPP however, is an after-tax payroll deduction. I'd rather put that money into my Roth IRA or my company's 401K if I can't actually realize a 3-5% gain with virtually no risk.

why it's the solar wind energy tower of course! slated to be built in san luis arizona, at a whopping cost of 1.5 billion dollars.
http://www.solarwindenergytower.com/

things i've learned while researching this thing that i've now 'invested' in...

the first patent for such an idea was proposed in 1920, and people have constantly laughed at anyone trying to build it.. because it needs to be more than a mile in height. (though, perhaps, this is possible today) 
the pictures on the website and in the youtube video don't make that abundantly clear, as it looks like a nuclear power plant.
picture a nuclear power plant, 2x as high as the empire state building.

there are patents on both updraft and downdraft towers.
imho downdraft towers have a better chance of working,
though some scientists say neither are feasible. 
for downdraft towers, mainly because the energy cost of pumping water up a mile in height is grossly underestimated by most statistical models.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_tower_(downdraft)

okay, so, why has SWET's stock been plummeting?
as far as i can tell, because of a recent conference call, discussing the need for more water than was originally estimated.

15-01-06,IRA Contribution/Portfolio Question,"Hey Everyone,

So I am making my $5,500 contribution right now. I am 24 years old with about $17,000 in my IRA.

Right now my portfolio is extremely risky, which I am fine with as I am only 24. My split is 83% US BRD MKT, 12% INTL EQ ETF, 5% US AGG BND. 

I am thinking about contributing the full $5500 into a dividend paying ETF, probably SCHD or SCHH. 

My thought process is if I get a good dividend paying ETF now, that I can just let it grow more and more until I am receiving huge amounts of dividends in my ROTH IRA. I figure in 35.5 years when I am ready to pull some money out I might be able to just live off the dividends themselves.  

The new split I am thinking of is what follows:
50% dividend paying ETFs, 25% US BRD MKT, 15% INTL EQ MKT, 10% US AGG BND.

15-01-07,Is my financial adviser screwing me? [x-post from /r/personalfinance],"Burner account here... 

When I married my SO I ""inherited"" the in-law's financial adviser, Robert. Robert works for one of the big banks and, of course, is a very friendly, charming, and a seemingly knowledgeable fellow.. as you would expect any 'successful' adviser to be. According to my father-in-law (who has millions of dollars with the company), Robert has ""done well"" for my in-laws.. .what this means exactly - I don't know. My father-in-law was a very successful business owner, but I doubt he is an expert at investments.

Anyway, my SO and I have ~2.5 million dollars invested with Robert - the majority ($1.7m) of that money is invested in local-state (NJ) municipal bonds to take advantage of their tax-free income. $500k is in a variety of mutual funds and the rest is in a few stocks. My SO and I aren't terribly concerned about growing that money right now as we like the additional income and, frankly speaking, are expecting to eventually inherit a very large amount of money. So why do I suspect we're being screwed over?

We recently started a 529 account for our first-born. I, of course, set it up through Robert who spent a while going over all of the options, discussing with me things like front end load, back end, a-shares vs b-shares, etc -- a lot of stuff that I understand on the surface, but am not really equipped to soak up and have a strong grasp on. Ultimately we decided I would invest $200/mo with [Franklin Templeton/NJ](https://www.franklintempleton.com/retail/pages/generic_content/prog_serv/529/pub/performance.jsf) .. broken up as such...

&gt; $100/mo
&gt; Franklin Moderate Allocation Newborn - 8 Years 529 Portfolio - A
&gt; Sales charge rate ~5.75%
&gt; 
&gt; $50/mo
&gt; Franklin Growth 529 Portfolio - A (Growth)
&gt; Sales charge rate ~5.75%
&gt; 
&gt; $50/mo
&gt; Franklin Corefolio 529 Portfolio - A (Asset Allocation)
&gt; Sales charge rate ~5.75%

.. now, I was talking with a friend last night who suggested that I'm being screwed. He mentioned that these plans up front-loads are absolutely garbage and pushing these kind of plans are how Robert is making his money. I don't like the idea that Robert isn't actually working for ME, but for the fund that pays him the most to push their goods. It seems to me that the funds with the highest fees/screw you the most are the ones that can afford to pay advisers the most to put clients into their funds.

From the little research I've done I agree that I'm probably in the wrong 529 plan. I feel lucky that I 'discovered' this early in our investing, but now I have to decide if I should change plans -- if so, where do I go? -- do I take the ~$4000 in there and move it? What should my new plan be? My friend suggested Vanguard. [SavingForCollege.com](http://www.savingforcollege.com/529-college-savings-planner/?ref=home_page_form&amp;child_age=0&amp;state_id=31) suggests that the best plan for me is the [TNStars College Savings 529 Program](http://www.savingforcollege.com/529_plan_details/index.php?page=plan_details&amp;plan_id=167).

Thinking about how I'm possibly being screwed in my 529 plan makes me curious if I'm also being screwed in my regular investments.. there's a lot more money in there and eventually there will be a even more. HELP ME PERSONAL FINANCE! YOU'RE MY ONLY HOPE!

15-01-07,Have money in an annuity - not sure how to handle this,"Background: Wife was in an accident and ended up getting ~150K from insurance. Being a teenager, her parents had her put it into an annuity for retirement.

Now, once we began dating and eventually married, I began looking deeper, especially as my knowledge of finances and investing grew. I soon saw how terrible the annuity actually was - her gains were capped at something around 3-5%, and I believe she had it in an S&amp;P 500 ""fund"" so if the market was up 14%, she was only up 5%. However, if the market was down, her losses were also limited. I don't remember all the specifics, but I didn't like it one bit. The expenses were also very high. 

We're both 25 years old, one kid on the way due in May, and live in a town home that I pay rent for. I have a solid 45k a year income with benefits, she works part time making less than 15k a year and is trying to finish college. 

I have proposed to her that we forfeit the annuity and cash out, leaving us with around 100K after penalties, and dumping in to some Vanguard funds. Income would be nice, like from a high dividend paying fund, but isn't necessary. I figured since we're still young we have time to make back the penalties we would lose, and then let it grow much more than it would in the annuity. 

She would like to do this as well, but is a little hesitant still. She's afraid of losing her money (that's another conversation I need to have  with her again), and I'm not 100 percent sure this is the best option or not. I don't know a whole lot about the taxes and I'm sure there are other angles I'm not looking at. Also, I'm not sure about holding it and dollar cost averaging it in to funds or just dumping it.

If anyone has some solid advice it would be highly appreciated. Being able to use this towards FI for the both of us would be great.",2

Over on /r/economics this was a relatively recent post:

http://www.doctorhousingbubble.com/canadian-housing-bubble-canada-real-estate-oil-economy/

While I don't agree with a lot of the data selected, I do believe that a housing bubble is coming to Canada's western cities. 

So, in whatever scenario you think is plausible, that results in a housing bubble, how would you do your research and how would you make money? 

I suppose this might come across as a ""tell me how I can make money post"" so I'll share my intuition. I'd start with Canadian REIT's, major Canadian O&amp;G operator's, major Canadian drilling companies and new build numbers, possibly well servicing as it's sometimes used as a proxy for slowing production, world oil production, Vancouver and Calgary infills.

I've been lurking on this subreddit for quite some time, and have recently opened up a Roth IRA.  I've contributed my maximum for this year (22 year old + single, so $5,500) and have discovered I'm in quite an awkward situation.

It appears that all Vanguard funds have a minimum of $3000, so I can't really diversify as I hoped to.

I'll probably contribute another $5,500 come April, so I won't be in this situation for too terribly long.

About 450 economic assistants from the BLS physically walk into stores and record prices of items on the ""CPI Market Basket"" monthly. These items and chosen to represent a standard families purchases.  The CPI is then calculated by seeing how those costs change month to month. The CPI is then released and if it increased the price of gold will increase and bond prices will fall. 

If you knew the changes in the CPI before it was released you could invest appropriately and make boat loads of money on it. So I wonder, perhaps naively, whether you could crowd source CPI data in order to know its changes before the official numbers are released. ",8

-Variable Annuity -  Account B - RR Series back end design Roth IRA - I max out the annual contributions @ the $5500/yr
-2x 65 Life Whole Life Ins w/ Aprox $150k death ben &amp; currently $3200 Cash Value
-600k Term to Age 80 Life
-Adjustable Comp Life Policy on my daughter (to be used to build cash value to use for college, wedding, ect in future)
-2x Disability Ins Policies w/ Montly bene of $3855

... I also have term life on my wife that is set up with them separately.

Separate from this I max out my traditional 401k at my employer at the $17,500/yr mainly to lower my AGI for tax purposes.

What am I doing right? What am I doing wrong? and What can I change or do better?",0

Say that you're an investor with capital to deploy and you're seeking strictly to maximize expected present value return of your principal regardless of when you actually receive your returns.  Assume also that you have a very strong conviction that certain macro events will happen in the next 50 years, ranging from likely scenarios (e.g. extreme oil shortages) to uncommon opinions (e.g. emerging country XYZ will become a world superpower).  

With such a long time frame, how would you invest on the probable outcomes?  What about the uncommon opinions?

The catch is they dont remember when exactly these shares were given to them (they think maybe in 1992) and they were  held with AGEdwards (an investment company) but then turned over to Wells Fargo in recent years since the amount wasnt great enough for AGEdwards to hold them. 

I dont have a cost basis for these shares, my parents like I said arent sure when they were given to them and to make matters a little worse I am pretty sure these shares were bought by my grandparents in like the 1940's. 

I am getting ready to do my taxes and want to make sure I do them correctly. I dont want to report it as a straight gain and also depending on when in 92 they were given to me the stock price in the beginning of 92 was actually double what i sold the share at so i could potentially claim it as a loss.

I want to get all of this sorted out before i go to get my taxes done but I am not sure exactly where to start.

15-01-08,This week I bought my first short-term call and put. I quit.,"By short-term I mean the expiration date was less than a week. 

On 1/5 I bought 20 F F Jan 09 '15 $15 Call at $.12. I bought this because they had good news that day, and still went down because the market was going down. I figured that if the market drop slowed down or turned around, then F would bounce back. It happened, and I sold at $.17, rather than waiting until the end of the week.

Cost: $265.32 Revenue: $314.67. Profit: 18.60% or $49.35

On 1/6 I bought 2 GPRO Jan 09 '15 $63 Put at $1.55. While the market was going down, I bought this because I really feel GPRO is overvalued. Maybe it'll prove me wrong; I don't know. I should have bought longer term than three days, but what the hell. It did drop.

Cost: $321.52 Revenue: $398.47. Profit: 23.93% or $76.95

My nerves can't take this shit. These were small positions relative to my full portfolio, and I was still sweating bullets. Both positions initially dropped because timing the market is impossible, and I considered closing my positions almost immediately. I'm glad I didn't, but I don't feel the risk/reward was worth it. For options, I'll probably stick to my safer covered calls and maybe a LEAP or two.

Edit: Hindsight is 20-20, but just to see where I would be if I wasn't being a little bitch :) :
The F calls had a final price of $1.20. The GPRO puts closed at $2.55. I left a bit on the table. ",13

I am 18, attending an online college and am going from part-time to transferring full-time working for a commercial hard-wood flooring company. (Have been doing flooring entire life; Dad is a former flooring company owner.) Either way, the pay is very good and I will be making much more money than I need to live. I pay no rent as I live with my grandparents and don't plan on moving out for at least 4 years. My only expenses are about $300 / month, going to be making close to $2,250 - $3,000 / month. Student loans are minimal and should have them paid off by the time I finish due to grants / payments.

I plan on investing as much of my money as possible. Based on what I hear / read index funds, Vanguard, is the way too go. My other question is that I need to put some of the money somewhere I can easily pull some out if needed. I was assuming I would 75% into an index fund, 25% into an accessible bank account, (checking / savings).

Hoping this may lead to some discussion/insight on what fellow investors are forecasting for some sectors this year.

2014:
Utilities led the way with a ~24% gain. Mostly due to the dividends that util companies offer since investors couldn't get much from the very low bond yields.

HEALTH CARE: ~23%. Biotechs had a phenomenal year. Health care was also, i believ,e the only sector to handle the early 2015 volatility (this past week) quite well. Can it carry through 2015?

TECH: ~18%. Tends to do well during expansionary periods. However, some of the top guys didnt have their best performances (i.e IBM).

FINANCIALS: ~13%. Solid Gains in 2014. Will rising interest rates benefit the sector (if they actually happen)?

STAPLES: ~13%

CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY: ~8%. Down a bit from 2013. Will lower pump prices lead to more spending?

INDUSTRIALS: Ended 2014 with ~7.5% gain. The oil drop towards the end of 2014 certainly was a boost to airlines. Will this sector improve IF (big if?) oil stays low.

MATERIALS: ~4.5%. Commods/mining dragged this sector.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS: ~ -2%. Poor 2014. May be a good bet for those who expect an economic contraction.

ENERGY: ~ -10%. The one everybody is talking about. The tanking of crude oil really destroyed this sector. Rebound? ",6

15-01-09,Moving my emergency fund into a roth IRA via Vanguard and future investment ideas?,"Hello! A bit of background - I'm about to be 29 years old, and wish I started managing money much more wisely earlier, but no time like the present.

I have a before tax 401k with my employer that I contribute the max (6%) for a total of ~7k.

I have about 10K in savings that sit in a money market currently.

I eventually plan to be a home owner, but am in no hurry. I live rent free, am single.

Based on my time here and personal finance, I don't see any reason why I shouldn't contribute $5,500 right now (2014) into a roth IRA (and continue to do so). My rationale is the yield will be undoubtedly larger than sitting. If I need the money down the line for a down payment, It qualifies as one of the penalty free withdrawals, or If I need just a little out of it, I can take out contributions.

What I need advice on, given my specific situation, is what to invest in via vanguard. Should I set it an forget it in an index, or should I be more aggressive? I will still essentially have a very liquid emergency fund after doing this, so I'm not worried about red tape liquidity of having to withdraw from the vanguard account, as if it were needed it would be planned (hopefully) well in advance.

Also, I consider everything saved beyond my remaining 4,500$ to be beyond my emergency fund. As I acclimate myself to investing outside of a savings account, what should I start researching to expand my portfolio?

Any advise/suggestions/pointers will be greatly appreciated. I am just now (sadly) getting into taking control of my future, so I am still fairly ignorant to the investing world - any time take to help me out would be extremely helpful.",0

Then you came into money in quite dark circumstances? Yes. When my mum died – when I was 21 – I inherited £360,000, which I invested into training to be a trader. My account skyrocketed, trading FTSE 100 and then FOREX. I did very, very well, and when Lehman Brothers went down I made an astronomical amount of money. I decided to put it all into property. I had six properties in Dubai, four in Morocco and two in Egypt at the age of 22, and I just wanted to focus on my running. Then this massive recession hit and I lost everything. At the time, I had around a £3.2 million net worth, but being paper rich is very different to having money in the bank. If the economy didn't crash as it did, I wouldn't be working right now.

Basically my question was how would he have made so much money from the collapse of Lehman Brothers I just assumed everyone lost out. Thanks in Advance

Any suggestions? Advantages/disadvantages of buying stock like MS/duke?

15-01-09,"Was asked by a religious individual to construct a low-risk, diversified portfolio. Here's what I came up with","A while back, a religious individual (someone who identifies with the religon of islam) asked me to help him construct a portfolio for him. For those unfamiliar with the religon, there are a few restrictions on what things can be invested in. For instance, all fixed income is a big no ( interest is consider impermissible) and, by extension, all large finance companies as well as REIT's are off the board. Also, the objective that this individual had was to create a portfolio that was diversified, had low volatility, low costs, and would produce a small amount of recurring income (dividends). 

For those out there that may be faced with a similar situation or are also religious, the best alternative I found was to simply invest in sector specific ETF's. That way, the portfolio would benefit from ultra low cost diversification while at the same time, avoiding financial services companies, REITS, and Fixed income. Vanguard actually has an excellent list of sector specific etfs that are really rather cheap (0.12 MER). 

Anyways, just thought that I would share that info. I actually wrote a small piece on this theoretical portfolio and then did a bit of analysis on its performance over the past 10 years.

15-01-08,2015: Oil Prices and the Effects,"I have never studied economics before, however I would like to describe my Oil-Price Economics Thesis and I would like some critical response on my rationality and correct my thought process.

Assumption: Oil prices remain low at sub $60 / barrel for 2015.

Effect:

* Oil consumers will greatly benefit with a lot of cost savings. Some examples include: an average family may save up to $1000 USD / year in gasoline/heating savings, airlines will make a lot more money (cheaper fuel, more vacations sold), and even basic consumer products/retailers will benefit (e.g., lower delivery/shipping costs).
* Oil producers will make less money. This includes governments (e.g., Russia / Alberta) and OilCorps and their employees. There will be layoffs in the oil patch.

The basis of my thesis is this: there will be a lot of extra $$ in the average consumer pocket, this money was previously allocated to oil is now available for spending. [see: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2015-01-07/oil-at-40-means-boon-for-some-no-ice-cream-for-others.html]. This extra $$ in consumer can be used for:

* [1] spending (growing GDP), or
* [2] saving (or reducing debt levels).

The inflation index will go down (e.g., oil is a huge component of the index), however, if consumers spend more, does it really matter? e.g., the inflation index might go down, but the average absolute dollars spent per consumer will actually be flat (e.g., shifted from oil to other consumer goods). We should actually not expect the FED to decrease interest rates, but rather increase interest rates. With the extra $$ per consumer, we can now increase the interest rates to soak up some of the $$ previously spent on oil to spend on servicing debt and mop up some of the cash in the market. Short term interest rates should rise, however I am not sure the effect of the long term interest rates.

Banks / Insurance Companies will benefit a lot (e.g., WFC). They hold a lot of mortgages, especially for WFC, their funding sources are mostly from savings and their cost will remain low. However, if interest rates rise they will make more $$. Banks / Insurance companies with such a profile will become a BUY.


Any criticism on this thesis would be awesome : )",2
15-01-08,Question from a Canadian trying to trade American stocks.,"Dear Reddit,

To preface, I'm an 18 year old living in Canada and have been trading stocks for the past year using my dad's TD Waterhouse account. While I started value investing, I am now more interested in short flips; finding bottoms and other patterns in order to make small gains. My principle is $10,000. So far I have done this 4 times, earning about a 3% gain on each transaction minus a $10 commission. Due to conversion rates (or conversion fees?) however each transaction that would have otherwise made me around $300 (a lot of money for me - a student), I have been losing around $80 per trade. Is there any other trading platform I can use to stop this from happening (ex. one that keeps dollars in USD) keeping in mind that I am not 19 yet.

Sincerely,

Beginner Trader",2

15-01-08,Is my grandmother being taken advantage of by her financial advisor?,"My grandmother has invested around $700,000 with a financial advisor. He purchased 3 different funds, each of which has a 5.75% front end load and around 1.15% annual expense ratio. This is a red flag and I've already lectured her on why this is a bad sign. Don't even get me started on this... 
This is a taxable account.

What I am curious about is why there is a $42,000 margin loan sitting in cash in her account. I can upload a picture of her statement if this would help. It doesn't appear that the margin is invested in anything, just sitting in cash--which she pays an interest rate on. Why would a financial advisor do this? 

My grandmother withdraws $11,000 every two months to pay her living expenses. She has no other taxable income and has about $60,000 in annual expenses related to medical care that are tax deductible. 

Does anyone have any insight as to what is going on here? Is the margin account being used to pay her expenses?

15-01-08,My investment plan for the future.,"Well what a year.  I'm really glad I I put 15k into kmp/kmi earlier in the year.  That turned out well.  I missed with UBNT.  In total my highrisk plays washed out.  I had like 2500 gains and losses.  I did not consider KMI a high risk move say all in all up quite a bit.  I washed on AIG today because I decided to move out of it and fund the Roth.  

My picks in the Roth beat the midcap index though considering they were pretty low beta I think I did well.  Still probably done picking for the most part.  I'm going to devote like ~5% to a gambling fund for my picks.

Loaded up the Roth today.  PSEC and ARCC.  Really wish ARCC wouldn't have been upgraded before the first of the year.  Probably will hold an REIT in the wifes.  Updated my 401k.  60/40 s&amp;p 500 and 40 bond (yes fucking vanguard).  I'm pretty heavy small/mid caps right now.  I'm just going to leave those be. 

I'm going to keep everything contribution wise in the 401k 60/40 split.  Going to rebalance twice a year.  The Roth's will be loaded up annually with REIT and BCDs for a little bit of diversification.

I do not hold foreign stocks.  I do not like foreign stocks.  I feel the USA s&amp;p500 gives enough expose to the world and I want to keep my money at home as much as possible.  The USA is the greatest country in the world in my opinion.  Why would I want to buy BABA or whatever crap China is selling.  I might gamble on it short term but yeah that is just how I feel.

Should have the house paid off probably by June.  If I liquidated one Roth and the taxable I could cover it now with my cash reserves.  I don't expect much to happen in the 6 months though. 

I'm 60/40 KMI/munibonds right now so I'm not to worried.  KMI is really going to have to take a shit before I'll lose money on it.  Same with the munibonds.

Liquidating the taxable probably in May so I can claim long term cap gains on KMI.

I'm think going to start maxing out the 401k middle of the year.  Might max the wife's as well but I think we will use that money to blow on things.  You can't take it with you, know?

Decided I'll probably keep my rental another couple years and go from there.  It like to at least break even on it.  We lived there for a while but thanks to the housing crush I'm still underwater on it (investment wise).  I think I'm going to see how stuff looks in 4 years.  If housing stays flat I'll break even at sale and have no cap gains/loses.  Overall it would have beat renting during that time frame, but barely, and I am making the best of a bad situation right now.  I did move into my new place for an excellent price so there is that also and I didn't destroy my credit.  Doing about 10% roi on the rental (after factoring replacement costs) so I still might hold.  When I finally sell it will determine my loss/gain.  

I think interest rates will stay low.  I think the dow will be around 19k next year.  My 17500 prediction was pretty spot on (see my history).

I've given up on stocks for the part on trying to pick them.  I'm going to go more marco in my approach and go after sectors on my gambling picks.  I think BCD's are way under priced.  I have no problem loading up on those this year.  Home loan is my highest debt loan at 3.8%.  I have assorted other loans below that so as long as I beat a little over 4% I'll be money ahead.  I decided on the house not to mess around with picking up pennies in front of the steam roller.  The other loans are student loans so whatever, I'll just defer them if I'm forced to do so but that would be one hell of a financial setback if that happened.

I'm in my early 30's and looking forward to an early retirement.  Feels good.  Not sure I'd do it again though.  I sat on my ass for many years doing nothing and just paying bills/saving money.",0

I follow the highly diversified, low-cost indexing approach. When people ask what I'm holding I usually just tell them the five funds I have and something like ""it's not exciting, but it works well."" Beyond that there isn't much to talk about, so I try to leave it at that. 

I have a few family members who use it as a conversation point. Most of them are stock pickers and market timers nearing retirement, and their accounts are fairly under-funded and very poorly diversified. I am 21 years old, for context. As such I get a lot of the ""I know best, so let me try and one-up you because I'm wiser"" stuff that older family members tend to do. I've tried not even starting conversations remotely related to investing, but it still gets brought up anyway. 

Just a sample of things I've heard/seen in the last couple weeks I've spent with family:

- ""I can't believe you aren't in on TSLA. I've been in since $175 and you're going to feel really stupid for not buying at these prices!""

- Fox News analysts being taken seriously on whether Google, Amazon, or Apple stock will have higher returns in 2015. When asked what I thought, I was laughed at after responding, ""I don't know, and anyone who claims to is just guessing.""

- People trying to convince me to sign up for Timothy Sykes' penny stock pumping newsletter or whatever it is. Told I was being stupid after simply saying, ""No thanks, I don't like penny stocks.""

- Being snubbed after people were discussing their best investments of 2014. Tried to stay out, was prompted for input several times. My simple LT US Treasuries ETF blew all of their picks out of the water. 

- One relative telling me he's been in the game long enough that he *just knows* the right times to get out and in. Proceeds to sell his Dow index at almost the exact low of 17,300 yesterday (as well as try to advise me to sell my indices) and he managed to miss out on today's gain of over 1.8%. 

I don't care that they treat the stock market like a casino, but it irritates me when they try to make me look like a fool for not following that mentality. Obviously I could be a complete dick and rub it in their faces in situations like the last two, and after a few times of that they probably wouldn't bring it up again. But I don't really want to stoop to their level, and it will just make the dick-waving that much more prominent when one of their stock picks outperforms an index. 

Most of the time I just grin and bear it, and try to extract myself from the situation ASAP. It restores a measure of sanity when I remind myself that my passive strategy will almost certainly outperform their picks and market timing in the long-run. 

Sorry for the huge rant. I'm curious, /r/investing, how do you respond to bad investors - especially family? Do you regret sharing with them that investing was an interest of yours? Do you have any humorous stories to share about your encounters with bad investors?",1

30%- VDE (try to capitalize on this current downswing in oil)

20%- VGT I like how the next couple years look for the smartphones

After a ton of research and a couple college classes, I set up my allocation to be 38% bonds, 19% foreign stocks, and 43% U.S. stocks.  These percentages are allocated equally in both accounts, with my 401K in Vanguard index funds, my taxable account with Charles Schwab accounts and their index fund offerings.  At this point I have a low risk tolerance, hence the large amount in bonds.

After reading a bit more, I found a gap with a lack of alternative investments.  According to some sources, alternative investments should make up 5-10% of my portfolio.  The problem is my 401K account doesn't offer any alternative investments (not totally true, the target funds do, but operating expenses are high).  If I use my taxable account to close that gap, I would have to invest the entire balance, and my gut feeling is that would not be wise.

15-01-09,"Comparison of brokers' fees available from Ireland","Hey /r/investing,

I was looking into investing some small saving I have, in Vanguard. The problem is, you need €100k to deal directly with them, or find a broker than deals with them. Despite many of Vanguards mutual funds, and ETFs being domiciled in Ireland, very few banks/brokers here deal with Vanguard, so my options for brokers are extremely limited.

The options I have researched so far are:

DavySelect ([link](http://www.davyselect.ie/our-services/trading-account.html)):

* Quarterly Maintenance Fee: €20
* 0.5% commission for stock trades or ETFs, with a minimum charge of €14.99
* 0.0% commission for funds

KeytradeBank ([link](https://www.keytradebank.be/en/our-fees/)):

* No maintenance fee
* Range of fees depending on which stock market
* €9.95 entry fee for funds; no exit fee, or annual fee

TD Direct Savings (Irish/EU branch of TD Ameritrade) ([link](http://www.tddirectinvesting.ie/what-you-can-invest-in/uk-investments/exchange-trade-funds/))

* Inactive Account (no trades in last quarter or less than €5000 balance) Fee: €15
* Commission Fee: Frequent Trader (more than 10 times in quarter): €15; Standard Trader: €20 
* _£1.50_ Dividend reinvestment fee

So, as you can see the options aren't great. At the moment I'm leaning towards KeytradeBank, so does anyone have any advise on any hidden fees?

15-01-09,Another New College Grad Advice Thread,"Hey guys, I've been lurking for a while my last year in college and after graduating have now started my first full time job.  I was  hoping to get some advice/critique on my ""responsible adult"" beginning investing/retirement strategy.


23 years old.  Salary of ~80k (very fortunate to be an engineer in the petro industry in Houston, assuming everything doesn't fall through with the OPEC situation hah)


About 25k in subsidized (~3.5% APR) and unsubsidized student loans (4-7.5%)
About 10k left on a car loan (~3.5% APR)
About 4k in CC debt


Getting about 15k combined after tax this next check for sign-on bonus, relocation, and regular semi-monthly salary.


For the short term my plan was to use that 15k to pay off my unsub student loans and credit cards.  This pretty much consumes most of the first check.  From here, because student loan APR is only around 3.5%, it seems like the suggested strategy is pay minimums on that until it's paid off in about 10 years and invest money that would have been used to pay that off earlier in 401k or index funds, etc since the return is better on average.  Same with the car payment (will be paid off in about 3 years if I go with that strategy and keep the same car).


For my retirement investments, my company matches 6% for 401k so I figured I would max the 6% (Fidelity).  Also chose the health savings account option after some research for health insurance (company contributes $750 to the account) and so I'd max the rest of that.  Finally I thought I'd max the $5500 roth IRA.  


Basically all this will be about 40% of my salary leaving some leftover money for living expenses, contribution to an emergency fund, fun stuff, saving for a house at some point, and maybe for investing in some index funds after emergency fund is taken care of.


What do you guys think?  I'd also like to buy a house in the next 5-7 years, if that is a factor (live in the Houston area).",0

15-01-09,Low oil prices and its impact on alternatives.,"First time poster and relatively new to actively investing. I've been contemplating buying some shares of Tesla (TSLA) and some solar energy companies, but with the oil prices as low as they are and the prediction that these low prices could last for a long time, I'm wondering what everyone thinks about the impact they'll have on a company like Tesla and solar companies like Musk's other alternative energy company, Solar City.

Right now my thinking is that other car companies might curb their investment and manufacturing of electric cars like what happened in the 80s when oil prices plummeted as well. Most consumers will be satisfied with buying a traditionally fueled car with oil prices so low. Do you think this will impact Tesla? They are obviously a company that focuses solely on electric car development, but will the consumers care with oil prices being so low? I know Tesla will always have supporters and that recent stat came out that 98% of current owners would buy another, but what about the average car buyer? Even when the lower priced models come out? Will low gas prices affect the common consumers vision?

My other thought on Tesla is that, if other car companies do curb their electric car development (and I have no evidence to support a claim that they will at this point) due to the drop in gas prices, would Tesla instead benefit by having a much bigger market share when oil prices shot back up (whenever that is)?

What do you think about solar energy companies; will they take a massive hit? Again, with low oil prices will people not look to actively look to alternatives?

There will always be those that will try to get away from fossil fuel usage for environmental reasons, but that market isn't too vast. What are everyone's thoughts?",35

15-01-10,Investing in Ecobank (and other pan-African companies),"Hi!

I've decided that I want to have some exposure to Africa. I looked into Ecobank which seems like a company ready to catch profits in an evolving continent. They only trade on three African exchanges which I have no access to trade on (Ghana, Nigearia and BRVM). Is there any way I can invest in them? I don't see any ADR's or GDR's being offered by them. 

 If it's impossible to invest in Ecobank, do you know any other pan-African companies dual listed on an exchange in the Western World (or offers ADR's or GDR's)?

15-01-10,Want to share some of my bets with this awesome community!,"Been lurking for a while, but finally made an account for sharing some of my bets.  I've been trading and investing for about ten years.  I mostly lost for the first five years, broke even for the following two, and have enjoyed significantly more success in the last three.

I use a combination of fundamental analysis (though not in the traditional sense of the word), chart reading (though I wouldn't call it technical analysis...I mostly use Google Finance), and gut feel.  

I subscribe to a trend-following-like model of risk control.  I make small bets with relatively tight stops and get stopped out frequently.  When I'm right, I usually let the trade run for months or even years, and make significantly more in one trade than I lost in all the others.

My losing bets are too numerous to count, though usually unremarkable because they're small.  Some of my biggest winning bets in the past few years have been long TSLA, long Bitcoin, long BLD calls, and short USO.

I'm up roughly 500% for the past 3 years (combined).  I've been increasing my position size recently due to more consistent success and a larger account size.

Some of my current bets:

Long TLT calls, long GLD puts, long Bitcoin (with the occasional short trade), long SJCX (Storjcoin cryptocurrency), long Ripple (cryptocurrency), long XCP (Counterparty cryptocurrency), long Stellar (cryptocurrency).  I think I still have some Dogecoins laying around somewhere too ;)

15-01-10,200K investing in Muni bonds Risk / Rewards? [repost from /personalfinance],"So I am a young man, I am only 22. I have inhereted about that much money. Despite my families attemps tp let it just sit in a bank account, which is slowly killing me I would love to invest it. They see it as savings I see it as future income to pay rent, loans, and to diversify my portfolio. So I was looking at Muni Bonds with a friend who is a Financial Planner. He has invested in them since the 90's. I BELIEVE the fund were looking into is called Ameribonds, which i believe is a bond fund. But i have seen the numbers which are typically returing 6-7% paid out Bi-Annually. Now forgive my non-familiarity, I am new to this I am just in the process of reading ""The Intelligent Investor"" good read! And trying to learn.
But as i understand bonds work as such. I put that 200K in for lets just use 1 year as an example. There is a coupon for lets say 6%. And I am a long term investor by the way. SO 6% is an income of 12,000 Annually, which can then be reinvested directly back into the fund, creating a bigger return. And As i understand these are tax free until the bond comes to maturity. Which I understand to mean that you get all of your money you put in back to you.
RISKS:
Now as interests rates rise your total amount of the bond lowers, but is offset by a higher interest rate of the initial amount you put in? example: Put 200K in, interest rate 6%. Interest rates rise to 7% dollar amount lowers BUT you still get 7% now of that 200K?
Another question, IF i am in it long term, how can there be that much risk with Muni Bonds? I am from NY, I am just looking to learn here :)",12

* S&amp;P500 took a hit recently and you expect it to rebound.
* You sell VOO and immediately buy IVV, and get the benefit of writing off the tax loss.

My question is, would the two funds be ""substantially identical""?

* To take this a step further, instead of buying the VOO, get the sector ETFs for S&amp;P500 (although I imagine transaction costs would become noticeable), or buy something like VV, VTI, or IWB (all with 1.0 correlation to SPY but do not explicitly track the index).

15-01-10,My Strategy: How to Make Money off Oil Volatility,"Hi guys,

I wanted to share with you guys an idea I've been working on for the past few weeks. If you've been watching oil tank and are wondering how that represent an investment opportunity this post is for you.

Background: I am a 24 year old recent graduate who has a full time job in commercial real estate. I have a strong interest in all things investing and finance but am very new to the equity market. I live and work in Toronto, so excuse the Canadian terms and stocks.

I started a really simple blog (http://investingmymoney.tumblr.com/) to track my ideas and trades, the first two posts which I've pasted below. They explain the theory behind my idea and the second is the full trade log.

----
Theory: Making money off oil volatility

Date: Jan 5, 2015

Idea: Make money off the short-term volatility of oil stocks

Stock: XEG.TO — a Canadian ETF that reps the largest oil companies. This stock currently hovers around $13.50 to $14.50 when only a year ago it was selling for $17. In the past few years it has averaged around $17 but has gone as high as $22. 

How: Buy XEG when the price falls in the region of $13.50 and sell when the price is near $14.25

Potential Return: 5.5% using the above numbers

Why this makes sense: The price of XEG is highly linked to the price of oil as well as market perceptions about the future price of oil. Fear has irrationally devalued energy stocks because of a slew of negative news around the price of oil.

Over the past 10 years oil prices have been on an enormous rally, peaking above $120/barrel. These high prices have caused producers to increase production in methods that were once thought cost-prohibitive. 

These projects take years to put into motion and we are now just feeling the supply increase from years of planning. However at today’s depressed prices these projects are suddenly unable to break even.

Oil cannot stay at a price of $50/barrel. High cost producers will shut off over time and the resulting pullback in supply with cause a price correction. In the long-term the price will again rise to an equilibrium close to $80/barrel, but I wouldn’t be surprised if they were to peak above $100 again.

This makes XEG a good long term hold — these oil companies are being sold off now but they are ideally positioned for the next 5 years. The fact remains that oil is our dominant energy source and is highly price inelastic — there will not be a good substitute in the next 10 years and likely the next 20.

In the short term however, the stock will continue to swing up and down presenting an excellent opportunity to make some quick money.

Downside risk: Only two risks

1) The price of XEG drops after I purchase
2) The price of XEG plateaus and does not rise after I purchase

Solutions:

1) If it drops — great, I just need to buy more. I will liquidate my dividend ETF to buy more XEG.
2) The plateau is trickier — all I need to do to succeed is hold the stock and DO NOTHING. Over time XEG is a good hold and will rise back to the range of $17. I just need to stay calm and not sell at a loss.

-----
TRADE LOG: XEG ETF

Yesterday I cataloged my strategy of speculating on the energy ETF XEG.TO . I want to use these trade logs to keep track of my progress buying and selling that ETF.

I’ll use exact numbers in dates to make it easy to follow along.

—- The initial buy

Dec 2nd - BUY 200 shares @ $14.48 = $2,928

Dec 5th - BUY 100 shares @ $13.87 = $1,387

Dec 15th - BUY 355 shares @ $12.12 = 4,302

Net purchase: 655 shares @ avg price of $13.15 = $8,617

—-

Thought process: When oil started dropping like a rock I did my research on what a good oil concentrated energy ETF would be. I settled on XEG.TO which was market cap weighted and had pretty much every Canadian oil company.

As I saw XEG drop from it’s price of $17 I opportunistically scooped up shares at $14.48. A few days later it was down to $13.87 and I dipped my toes in again. Ten days later the stock was down around the $12 mark and I couldn’t help myself — I view this stock as a long term hold and $12 as a bargain basement price. I decided to double down at $12.12.

What was going through my mind at this time? Although I logically decided oil (and XEG) were seriously undervalued, my stomach did backflips throughout this whole purchase. I gritted my teeth and pushed through my anxiety to make this trade.

Lesson learned: As much as you might think you want to “buy at the bottom” and be a contrarian investor, it takes serious intestinal fortitude to buy big while a stock is plummeting.

—— The sale

Dec 20th - SELL 655 shares @ $14.40 = $9,432

Net gain of +$805** (9.45% gain)

**This is after the $10 brokerage fee (FYI I highly recommend Questrade as a solid low fee brokerage)

—-

Thought process: I had resolved to hold XEG forever but after seeing the price shoot back up to $14.50 only days after I had doubled down gave me pause. I had the weekend to think about cashing out my potential return.

This would go against  everything I had learned from Warren Buffett — the real money is to be made by being patient and holding. However, this opportunity made me think differently.

First of all, a (near) 9.5% return is tough to pass up. Since all of these trades are made on my TFSA account, there is no capital gains tax to worry about. Also,my TFSA is fully funded, so I view this gain as extra capital which will be able to grow at a compounded rate for a long period of time.

On an emotional level, this gain was just days after my stomach churning decision to double down my purchase. No doubt I was anxious to be able to get out with a decent profit.

There is another logical reason I decided to sell it all — this rally of energy stocks came after a serious sell-off days earlier. I felt the rally, like the sell-off was an over-reaction of the market. 

My thinking was (and remains) that oil will be volatile over the short run (roughly a year, maybe more) but will have great upside in the long run. That is, I just made 9.5% by exploiting the volatility of the market — why not do it again? And again. And as many times as the market will let me over the short term. 

So I sold it all. 

— The Re-Buy

Jan 5th - BUY 346 shares @ $13.57 = $4,695

Jan 5th - BUY 173 shares @ $13.26 = $2,293

Jan 6th - BUY 184 shares @ $13.00 = $2,392

Net purchase: 703 shares @ avg price of $13.34 = $9,380

—

Thought process: You’ll see I purchased these in blocks as the price dropped. I meant to purchase it all at $13 but got too ancy and pulled the trigger. I like purchasing in blocks to dollar cost average.

I’ve set an auto sell for $14.50. Now the plan is to sit back and if I can rinse and repeat…",1
15-01-11,Principal when opening term deposit,"Hi,

I want to do a term deposit, but when trying to open the account it asks me to choose between different options.

2. At maturity pay principal to an account

2. At maturity pay interest to an account

I understand the term interest, but I've haven't heard of principal in this context before. After some research it looks like that the principal is the original amount invested. Can anyone confirm that for me, please?

If I want to get all of the money paid out later I'd choose ""At maturity pay principal to an account"" and ""At maturity pay interest to an account"".

15-01-10,Driving Thoughts,"Hi guys,

An idea popped up in my mind when I was driving home during the holidays, and I can't seem to finish the thought. I sketched out a few points below and was wondering if anyone would like to shoot the bull for a bit and help flush it out. 

The whole concept revolves around explaining different investing topics to friends and family through an extended car/driving/transportation metaphor that's visual:

Why do people invest? The same reason why people drive -- to get somewhere. It should be clear that different people will have different end goals. That's one of the reasons why there's no universally recommended strategy. 

In terms of explaining different asset classes, I feel like I would have to talk about the financial infrastructure that's set up. That way, the example could also elucidate the concept of investing abroad. I digress. While there are various roads/paths that you can take, the really big ones are ""cash/money market,"" ""equity,"" and ""fixed income."" Equity is traditionally viewed as being a faster path, and thus suitable for younger folks; fixed income, on the other hand, is for ""old people"" who tend to go slower and aren't necessarily in any particular rush. Cash would be a parking lot...maybe a garage. In any case, pursuing equity would be like choosing to drive via highway, whereas investing in fixed income would be like choosing to drive all local. Sometimes it might make sense to drive highway, but sometimes it's better to drive local because the highway is too crowded. Also, depends on the weather conditions. If the roads are icy, or we're expecting ice, you should probably use caution. It's better getting somewhere slightly later than trying to rush and getting into an accident...unless, of course, you have wonderful insurance (put option...not sure I should introduce this, because I am uncertain about how to introduce call options). There are also other potential paths, such as freeways, toll roads, dirt paths, alleys, subways, trams, railroads, which could be used to describe other asset classes.  In essence, it's about speed, safety, access, and, ultimately, reaching your destination.  

In particular, I'd like to explain some of different types of investment *vehicles*. In terms of the various possibilities of investing, there are individual stocks, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, private equity funds, hedge funds, and so on. I feel that a train or bus would be the best way to explain mutual funds. The pro about using the train example is that I could talk about hedgefunds being the higher ticket cost, but being faster, whereas the lower cost ticket train would be a mutual fund. I could also get fancy by introducing maglevs and such, but also talk about how certain high-speed trains share rails with low speed trains, and are thus bounded sometimes.  As for the difference between mutual funds and ETFs, it's basically just difference in ticket cost. However, there's so much possibility with motorcycles, trucks, limos, tanks... gotta make it interesting. 

Later on, I might include topics such as ethical or socially responsible investing as being electric vehicles. 

International would be fun to talk about too, because you could definitely point to driving laws/customs and the available infrastructure.

15-01-11,American Funds vs Vanguard for 403(b),"Hello!

I did a search on the sub for this question, but didn't find an answer to my question. So here I go!

I am new to a company and can sign up for a 403(b) plan with either Vanguard or American Funds. The investment firm my company works with (Morgan Stanley) came out to talk to me and he tried to push American Funds, but I wonder if it is because he would get a cut from it vs if I go with Vanguard I will do it all myself.

I am leaning towards American Funds only because I wouldn't even know which stock to pick for Vanguard.

Background: I know nothing about investments, have no investments, and am in my late 20's. After a year at my job I am eligible for a money purchase plan, but I still have 9 months to go so I want to start investing something.

""","http://brooklyninvestor.blogspot.com/2015/01/the-perils-of-market-timing-iii.html 

Another brilliant post by the Brooklyn Investor discussing market timing, hedge funds *that claim to get equity-like returns and low correlation to the stock market* (italicized because not all hedge funds aim to do this), the different risks you can take in the market and their trade-offs. 

There's also a link within to post to a Pzena commentary 

http://www.pzena.com/investment-analysis-3q14-2

""Interestingly, when we compare the volatility of equities to the volatility of hedge funds, we reach some startling conclusions. The volatility of equities falls sharply as holding period increases. But for hedge funds, that is not the case ...""

Pzena Investment Management obviously has a bias to try to sell their services, so keep that in mind, but the numbers seem solid. Here's the conclusion to the Pzena paper for those too lazy to read:

""Since 2008, investors have increasingly focused on short term metrics in making investment decisions, and their desire to reduce risk has driven them to implement various “low volatility” strategies and tactics. Unfortunately all of these actions revolve around the use of short-term volatility data. This seems to be fundamentally at odds with the basic underpinnings of what makes long term investing so successful. The better choice seems obvious: use long-term investment data that better fits with the time horizon of the liabilities that the investment assets support.""  

If you enjoy this post, I encourage to you read the Brooklyn Investor's other posts, they are excellent discussions and explorations of investing. Like any good investing advice, he's basically saying the same thing over and over in a slightly different way.",0

15-01-11,Ambitious Tesla Runs Into Roadblocks,"Copied and pasted from: http://www.businessinsider.com/afp-ambitious-tesla-runs-into-roadblocks-2015-1?IR=T

New York (AFP) - Tesla Motors has been the darling of Wall Street. A-list stars including Hollywood's leading men Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt and George Clooney are all also fans.

It lured them with the luxury electric Model S and is now going after the middle class with its Model 3, a compact electric sedan set to debut in 2017 for a starting price of $35,000-$40,000.

Compare that with the sleek Model S, costing upwards of twice the price.

Elon Musk, Tesla's billionaire founder, hopes the Model 3 will propel the California manufacturer into the mass market and has ambitions to triple Tesla production to 100,000 vehicles this year and to 500,000 per year by 2020.

But Musk, the man behind the online payment site PayPal who also founded SpaceX, faces an uphill task and growing skeptics.

The rapidly falling price of oil has put gas-guzzling cars back to the fore, at the expense of electric vehicles, and Tesla shifted 18,750 cars on the US market in 2014, down 3.1 percent year on year. It had a target of 35,000 deliveries worldwide last year.

Morgan Stanley, one of the few US banks that believed in Tesla's lofty ambitions, is now doubtful.

""We continue to view Tesla as a niche player,"" it said in a note to investors late last year, saying that it expects the company to deliver closer to 300,000 electric vehicles by 2020 -- far short of its 500,000 target.

Tesla's ambitions rest on its ability to manufacture a battery at a competitive price, which seems difficult in the current environment, where oil is plumbing record lows with each passing week, Morgan Stanley said.

Financial markets are also doubtful of Tesla's ability to segue its way into the popular car market.

Its stock was trading at $275 in September, but, ahead of the Detroit auto show next week, it is now down to $206, providing more ammunition for the skeptics.

- 'Special case' -

Nobody could accuse Tesla of standing still, however, and it is building its Gigafactory in Nevada to produce lithium-ion batteries, costing an eye-watering estimated $5 billion to construct.

The purpose of this mega project is to reduce the cost of the battery, thereby reducing the selling price of electric cars.

But analysts say this huge investment -- while central to Tesla's plans -- may affect its financial results. 

In addition, Tesla forked out fast-charging stations for free in western Europe for its standard bearer Model S.

Tesla, also pushing hard to boost overseas sales -- especially in fast-growing China -- was ""a special case,"" said Martin Zimmerman, a professor at the University of Michigan and former head economist at Ford.

""People who are buying Tesla have a lot of money to spend. They want to have the latest technology and so they are buying these electric vehicles,"" he told AFP.

""Tesla is, in total sales, they're small... With the Gigafactory, they're trying to bring the battery cost down. That will help, but still I think compared to the $50 oil, or $60 a barrel oil, that has really created a change in circumstances.""

In the immediate future, Tesla is working on a Model X, a crossover utility vehicle and followup to the widely acclaimed S. First deliveries were expected in the spring, but there have been multiple delays. 

The startup is also working on new versions of the Model S with four-wheel drive to seduce buyers in US states where the weather is less forgiving than sunny California.",0

Basically, **when looking at a large time frame, does diversification become less important because time mitigates the risk the same way diversification does?**  If so, wouldn't the 9% Index gains be better than the 7.5% gains of a well-diversified portfolio?  Why cut into your expected profit?  Rebalancing to something more stable and consistent could take place 25-35 years into the 40-year plan when the market is at a high point, couldn't it?  As long as you have a 5-10 year buffer on your retirement and rebalancing year, of course.

I'm a newbie who's begun to take an interest in investing. I've just started out and I've finished a For Dummies book, and I've finished a couple of Warren Buffett books. Yesterday, I tried my hand at looking through oil companies and trying to select the cream of the crop. It was a failure. 

What I had learned from reading and what I had taken notes on seemed to escape my head, and I seemed to have no direction.

So my question is: 
When you guys are evaluating companies, oil companies in this case, what kind of checklist would you go through in your head? 
Do you guys start quantitatively?
What figures are you generally looking for from a quantitative standpoint? I found that a lot of the figures they recommend finding in books are not present, and I have no idea where to find them.

15-01-11,Is having exposure to ExUS/RestOfWorld in retirement account still advisable? (US investor),"I'm a fairly new investor, and have been contributing to my retirement accounts for about 5 years.  The classic retirement account allocation advice says to put a significant chunk of your money (perhaps 30-40%) into an ExUS index for diversification.  However, the US seems to be much stronger than the rest of the world at the present moment.  Also, I've noticed that whenever the US falls, the rest of the world seems to fall with it, and usually harder.  The US market seems to be kind of the bellwether that other markets follow at a higher volatility.  Note that I'm not talking about emerging markets which to me are more of a gamble, I mean an equal weighted ExUS, rest of world, global, or similar index.  

Have there historically been examples of the US falling or doing poorly, and the rest of the world not following suit, but rather doing better?  I don't mind rebalancing my portfolio once or twice a year, but I'm looking for long term simplicity and low fees in my retirement account, perhaps only S&amp;P 500, Russell 2000, and (later in life), some bond funds.

Europe shit the bed.

I don't know. Something just doesn't feel right to me. I'm basically out of the market now with my taxable account. I sold out early Friday morning. I put the Roth into BCD's because that is the only sector that doesn't look elevated right now to me.

I got out the money I wanted to use in the short term. Decided to pay off a chunk of the house and take the 3.8%. I am pickup pennies in front of the steam roller with my student loans and I still have rental property mortgaged so if rates do rise I can let those chew into it a little though it is an ARM, but I got several more years before it adjusts.

Only one thing I'm relatively confident on. Rates are going to stay low. That means more QE or the market is coming down.

If the market comes down more people are going to flock to bonds and drive the yield price down. So again rates stay low.

If rates rise home loans go up also. That will drive down home prices. So again rates will stay low.

Either way I think bond yields are going to stay low. I don't think the market is going to go up much this year.

I don't see anything that is going to drive inflation in the short to medium term.

What do you all think?

Whether you're a casual trader, fortune 500 executive, wall streeter, or financial markets journalist, what is the most interesting financial markets development you've ever witnessed or experienced? What is your personal experience that is truly unique?

Hypothetical Examples of a personal experience:

* I worked for Knight Capital the day they lost $460 million on a trading glitch
* I knew Bernie Madoff and invested money with him.
* I've listened to conversations where BP lawyers discussed the BP oil spill
* I worked on the Vonage IPO

Basically just imagine you're writing your version of a short Michael Lewis book. 

**The relevance of my question:**

Many of you are probably familiar with the efficient market hypothesis. Many of you are also probably familiar with the high-frequency trading and the importance of latency in modern financial markets. Basically, if you believe the EMH and understand how effective HFTs are at anticipating market movements, finding 'alpha' seems impossible. 

Having recently been reading a lot of Taleb, Polanyi and others, I am convinced that markets are much more complicated than an economist's macro model might have you think. I am very interested in the ways that human nature continues to drive markets. So let me put it this way: we don't yet know what the next major development in financial markets will be, and I think that has very much to do with the unpredictability of human nature. For this reason, I am very interested in the ways human react and respond to major financial market developments. How did you react? How did everyone else react?

I was given an opportunity to invest in a private company at x$/share. 

The company is in the oil industry, newly created just for a domestic drilling project. It's not an exploration venture, more development since the area is well known with several oil wells nearby. 

Lease + geo report is in place, and they are quietly raising capital for operation costs. If all goes well (find enough oil), they will IPO within the year and share prices should significantly go up. Their exec/mangement team looks solid, apparently well known in the industry and I've been told it's a sure bet.

Does anyone have any experience in the industry or any relevant knowledge? What are the chances of it being a successful operation? What are the chances of the company going into IPO? Basically, how should I go about and evaluate this opportunity? Where do I even start? I'm hesitant because I have absolutely no experience in this industry and from my limited knowledge know that generally these ventures can be very risky.

Recently I tried to open a brokerage account with Scottrade.  After having my online application fail for vague reasons I contacted them via phone and it was suggested that I try again at a local branch.  I went into a local branch and when the employee ran my info I came back ""DNO - Do Not Open"".  He indicated it had something to do with my credit file and told me there was nothing else he could do.

So, it having been over a year since I last did so, I went ahead and requested my free annual credit reports.  Everything looks good and accurate.  I can't see my scores, but I recently got a car loan and had no problem getting a good rate on that.

I call back and after some ado I'm told that status is provided to them by a third party company and that I'd have to take it up with them.  They referred me to an 800 number for ""Compliance Data Center"", which is apparently an arm of Equifax.  I called the number multiple times but only ever get a ringing line that goes on for 30-40-50+ minutes.  Nobody ever answers.  Ever!

I poked around on their website a bit but wasn't able to find anything useful.

If it matters, I've been able to open investment accounts with other companies.  Within the last year I've also opened a new credit card.  Within the last two I've gotten a car loan and within the last six I've bought and subsequently sold a house.

The only thing I can think of that might be a potential ""red flag"" is that I have bounced around quite a bit in the last two years, having had a couple of addresses and having changed jobs three times (though I make more money now than I ever have).

So, does anyone know what this means, what the cause might be, and/or what I might be able to do about it?

Lastly, I really don't give a crap about opening an account with Scottrade specifically, I'm much more concerned about simply getting to the bottom of this, understanding it, and knowing whether it's something that I need to ""fix"" or not.",2

- I bought NPSP at around $30/share. It was announced that Shire would buy NPSP for $46/share, all cash. NPSP closed at around $42 Friday.
- What do I have to do now? Just wait until the deal goes through? Will the item simply disappear from my holdings and cash be automatically deposited into my broker account?
- What usually happens at this point? Will trading be stopped? Or will there be a rush to buy starting Monday until the price rises and settles slightly reasonably below the announced sale price?
- Is waiting for the final acquisition the best way for me to maximize my profits? Or are there any circumstances under which I would want to sell before the sale is executed?

15-01-12,Spread betting vs buying shares? (UK),"Hi,

I'm trying to weight up the pros and cons of spread betting vs actually buying shares on a very long term basis.

I'm in the UK and we don't have to pay any taxes or fees on betting 'winnings'. When I compare this with the stamp duty (0.5%), share dealing costs (usually £10 plus a 1% fee if I buy foreign equities) and capital gains/dividend taxes it seems like the spread betting (just cover the cost of the spread) is a no brainer. 

I feel like I've overlooked something very important though - basically if this is the case, why doesn't everyone do it? I know spread betting can be riskier, but I'd have to fully cover the entire position anyway to ensure I don't have any rollover costs.

Thanks",2

15-01-12,"Frustrated with 401k, dividend reinvestment","Rookie question maybe, but I couldn't find anything on this subreddit that could address my concern. 

I've worked for two companies in my adult life.  Company A used Wells Fargo as their 401k platform and at the end of the year the 401k distribution/reinvestment was clearly annotated on my Q4 summary.  

Company B uses financial group B (don't want to slander a company I may not understand).  It comes to Q4 of this year and I see nothing as far as a distribution/reinvestment.  So I email our company rep at financial group B to ask why I don't see a reinvestment statement.  These are large cap and small cap funds with a portfolio mix that definitely should churn out 1-2%.   The response I get is ""we never had an option to reinvest dividends"".

Ok so I'm left there fuming because obviously this is terrible customer service, she should have explained where the dividends go.  Anyway, in a brief e-mail back I state that this really isn't something I'm happy with and I would have to reconsider my investment strategy.

Next e-mail she replies that she misunderstood and they do in fact reinvest dividends.  Instead they do not explicitly state the distribution, however, they roll it into a NAV.   This information is meshed into the annual returns figure.  The example she gives me is that if a year provides 7.2% gain in the market and dividends total 1.6% that they will present me a NAV of 8.8%.

I'm not really happy with this either, but she says that its the industry standard.  I feel like its a marketing ploy to inflate their numbers on a technicality. Could you guys provide feedback on this?   Is this what you have experienced?  I much prefer seeing the Wells Fargo summary where I get number of shares, unrealized gains/losses, and distributions (albeit reinvested) itemized.... maybe I was just spoiled.

Thank you in advance!

TL;DR: I hate the way my current financial group presents NAV as the yearly gain and reinvestment of dividends without detail.  Is this the industry standard or do your financial companies show you the breakdown of investment, unrealized gains/losses, and reinvested dividend?",1

The iPod Classic (mainly the 160gb version, but the 80 and 120gb as well) has surged in price in recent months since Apple removed it from their store. A used 160gb is around 200 Euros, and a new one around 500-600. Crazy!

I own a 120GB that I'm interested in selling in exchange for saving to an iMac, but it's (as always, just like with stock) hard to tell when's the right time to sell. I estimate it's worth about 100-150 Euros at the time, but I'm not sure.

Frankly, what I'm asking for is advice and other people's look on the matter. What do you think of the price development? How have items such as the iPod historically been valued after their selling stopped? Do you think the price will rise with time, hit a plateau, or fall?

First thing he told me to do was open a Traditional IRA and contribute to it. For 3 years, I contributed the max to it and bought a ton of mutual funds.

15-01-13,"Ray Dalio - All Weather (Acc'd to Tony Robbins)","Apparently, the following is what Ray Dalio recommended to Tony Robbins for the average investor, thoughts?

The All Weather Portfolio

First, Ray said, we need 30% in Stocks (for instance, the S&amp;P 500 or other indexes for further diversification in this basket). Initially that sounded low to me but remember, stocks are three times more risky than bonds. And who am I to second guess the Yoda of asset allocation!?
“Then you need long-term government bonds. 15% in intermediate term (7- to 10-year Treasuries) and 40% in long-term bonds [20- to 25-year Treasuries].”


“Why such a large percentage?” I asked.


“Because this counters the volatility of the stocks.” I quickly remembered it’s about balancing risk, not the dollar amounts. And by going out to longer-term (duration) bonds this allocation will bring a potential for higher returns.


He rounded out the portfolio with 7.5% in gold and 7.5% in commodities. “You need to have a piece of that portfolio that will do well with accelerated inflation so you would want a percentage in gold and commodities. These have high volatility. Because there are environments where rapid inflation can hurt both stocks and bonds.”


Lastly, the portfolio must be regularly rebalanced. Meaning, when one segment does well, you must sell a portion and reallocate back to the original allocation. This should be done at least annually and if done properly, can actually increase the tax efficiency. This is part of the reason why I recommend having a fiduciary implement and manage this crucial ongoing process.",1

I won’t repost the whole methodology, but basically I assumed a $5000 annual budget for purchasing 'shares' of the S&amp;P 500 over rolling 30-year periods from 1951-2013. The four strategies were: 


(1) $5000 first day each year (LS)


(2) $416 every month (DCA)


(3) Buy with available funds if previous close was 1-YR low (1YR-LOW)


(4) Buy with available funds if previous close was 5% from maximum (5PC-LOSS)


In the original post I assumed that money held in cash did not accrue interest. I noted this was likely a bad assumption but had no money market rate data. For the strategies that have less frequent buy-ins (3&amp;4) this cash interest could have significant impact. /u/fireandnoise pointed out that I could use the 3-MO Tbill rate [data]( http://m.research.stlouisfed.org/fred/series.php?sid=TB3MS) to estimate money market rates (thank you!) and I did.


**Results**


Here are the updated graphs of total value ($) at the end of each rolling 30-year period from 1951-2013 (when dividends are automatically reinvested).

[Total Value Compared to LS](http://imgur.com/TcrYBRr)


In addition, /u/jaghataikhan suggested I determine the maximum drawdown of each strategy and use this to look at risk adjusted returns. Here are those new graphs:

[RAR compared to LS](http://imgur.com/F4PexdZ)


**A few thoughts**


Interest on funds held in cash made a huge difference. Strategies 3&amp;4 showed much better total returns than last time, but the LS method still has the highest expected returns overall. That being said, other strategies have higher expected risk adjusted returns. The graph that shocked me the most was the maximum drawdown which was greater than 40% in most 30-year periods! Gave me an idea of the intestinal fortitude I likely need to have at some point in time. 


Last time I used the words ""total portfolio value"" when discussing the final value of each 30-year period. This wording was misleading since this information would only be applicable to the portion of your portfolio in an ETF that tracks the S&amp;P 500. Just keep that in mind. 


Really interested to hear any other insights/suggestions! As I mentioned before, I tried a few other strategies that ended up beating LS most 30-year periods. Usually this involved investing a large portion of the annual funds right away and then investing the rest after a percent loss threshold. Would love to know what others come up with!


I did my best to make sure the code was error free but please double check (and post here if you find something wrong). On my shitty laptop the current version for these four strategies takes around 30 minutes to run. I have it running for every market day because I was plotting the entire 30-year periods, but you could cut down the run time by skipping the non-action days.

Is Gilead's Sovaldi a more convenient treatment with less side effects? Maybe, but it doesn't seem to matter. Money talks, and AbbVie's discounted treatment is winning business. 

Not only that but their drug Duodopa just got FDA approval for Parkinson's. That's promising.

PEG ratio is a very reasonable 1.69 and dividend yield of 3% beats Celgene and Gilead which do not offer a dividend.

15-01-13,"Come on big whammies, no winners","I am looking at who might miss with a few spare bucks over the next few weeks.  Here's my best ideas as of the end of the day today...


1) We've seen adjustments down for the oil/gas and oil/gas service sector with the price of crude in steep decline, but just this past couple weeks have we seen banks affiliated with oil and gas due to large amounts of oil/gas lending start to take a hit.  The first taste we'll get of what to expect is tomorrow on the open, 15% of WFC's investment lending revenue is oil and gas related.  They will surely be asked about oil/gas exposure in the conference call tomorrow.  Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Nova Scotia, Citi, and Barclays also have greater than 10% of their investment lending revenues coming from oil and gas related lending.  Bank of Nova Scotia is at 35%, holy overexposure, batman.  Smaller banks in Louisiana and Texas also have large exposures to this downturn (MSL and IBKC are two that are starting to suffer in share price this past couple of weeks).  This might not be that big a deal if banks had anything else to look forward to but honestly, spreads are still low so they don't.  The bump above 2 in the 10 year was a blip on the radar last fall, the correction killed it, we're back below 2 as of now.  If a bank doubled up on oil and gas lending to cover their lack of spread in other lending activity, they're gonna get killed in the next few months.  Just a matter of finding out which ones did that, I'm digging through paper looking for them.  


2) Something doesn't add up with GILD.  You have analysts consensus predicting an increase in EPS for this quarter, all while drug retailers are saying that the price competition between GILD and ABBV is so fierce that they didn't even bother signing an exclusivity with either of them on CHC/1 drugs [because the discounts were so insignificant for doing so](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2015-01-12/prime-covers-both-gilead-and-abbvie-liver-drugs-as-prices-plunge.html).  Someone is wrong.  GILD's CHC/1 drug is a about 10% of GILD's total sales, we don't know yet how much revenue ABBV will post with its competing drug, approval was just granted in December by the FDA, all we know is that they instantly undercurt GILD's prices with the initial offering.  As of now ABBV's share price is down about the same amount as GILD's share price around all this news.  Flip a coin on which you think will be the loser (or maybe both?).  I honestly don't know how to play this.  If I played at all, I'd probably be long ABBV and short GILD.  Pharmaceuticals, meh.


3) Out of all of the oil companies suffering with low prices, for whatever reason Exxon is only down about 10%.  Compare that with an average amongst other large oil and gas companies who are, typically, down about 25%-40%.  XOM consistently beat estimates by ~10% throughout 2014 but that just can't continue.  Consensus EPS estimates for XOM have been revised down by 20% in the past 90 days but the stock has only lost 10%?  Seems like a lot of blind faith in XOM to me, particularly with CVX down 23% as a good benchmark to compare them to.


4) FB warned of increased spending in their last quarter and did not beat estimates by as much as they were beating them in quarters prior.  If anything will take a huge dive on a miss it's Facebook, but damn is it expensive to get in on their downside.  What we can see is that there is not a gross imbalance to the call side ahead of FB's earnings report, it seems to have found its balance in the mid 70s.  I'd really like to take a stab at some FB puts, but will wait into next week to see if IV will come down a bit to make the final decision on that.

5) INTC was 2014's tech darling but it's not like they suddenly righted the ship.  They have more-than-doubled their long term debt while drawing down their cash by almost half since 2012, and the only thing that really stands out in 2014 versus the prior two years was a ramp up of share buybacks.  The first really good quarter to justify that year-long move up was September of 14, and even if those September 14 profit numbers continue, that just puts them on par with where they were at the beginning of 2014, revenue hasn't been appreciably changed since 2011.  Best case scenario...it was cheap then and now it isn't.  Worst case scenario, it's expensive now and soon won't be.  More debt and spending cash to buy back shares isn't a long term plan that's going to keep us all happy with INTC's future.  Consensus estimates have them at 66 cents a share for this quarter, and a decline to 51 cents a share for the next.  If they miss on this one, it'll be quite a nose-dive in share price.  I'll throw a little put money on INTC tomorrow.

I work for a large telecom that lots of people hate - enough that it was caricatured on a popular sitcom. The company is in the process of trying to purchase one of its larger competitors, and in the event of regulatory approval, the stock could see a significant jump in value. That's all the information I can provide - it should be enough for most of you to figure out who I am talking about.

They offer employees an ESPP which provides shares at a price of 15% off the first or last day of the quarter, whichever was lower. This usually leads to a handsome return. The catch is shares aren't eligible to be sold for 1 year (I know there are tax ramifications with that short of a sale anyways). After 1 year, they're yours to do with as you please.

So, after years at this company I have a decent sized collection of stock, but my concern is that I am so heavily invested. Most of my portfolio is well diversified. But this one particular brokerage account - if the stock nosedives, the account will go with it. 

My speculative side wants to keep the shares that are eligible to be sold with the likelihood that the merger is approved. My safe side wants to sell the eligible shares and buy shares of an index fund to minimize risk. I have 4 quarters worth of shares that I can't touch so if the deal is approved and the stock soars, i will see some benefit. Also if the deal is not approved and the stock dips, I will see some pain when speculators jump ship.

The stock soaring is at least a little unlikely given the efficient market hypothesis, right? Outside of some folks who will jump in when they hear that the deal is approved but I assume that would be temporary.

15-01-14,"Here's how to backtest a trading algorithm in C++ with no outside tools.","Over the past month there seems to have been a large interest in quantitative analysis, algo trading, and that sort of stuff. 

Here's an example of how you can backtest an idea and for instance, 100 permutations of said idea in a few seconds with pretty much any stock's data.

For the example below, I've coded in C++, which would actually be significantly harder than working with something like PHP. The benefit of working in C++ though is time. It takes much less time to run than almost any other language. This would get important for calculations if you were sampling say, 10,000 days of data for multiple tickers and performing more intense calculations like skewness or crossing other indicators.

For this example I used what I call the ""Inertia Index"", which essentially tells you what the average increase or decrease has been over a certain period (say 21 days), over the entire interval. I calculate the inertia index in this code, and then I test simply for whether or not the inertia index crosses above zero. If so, I tell it to buy on the next trading day. I then pick the number of days to hold, however you could make it so that it holds until it dips below a value or some other metric that is not as black-and-white.

[Here's the Inertia Index. It's right below the price chart.](http://lavancier.com/research-data.php?ticker=SPY&amp;interval=900)

Here's a visual example of what this essentially does:

    NO, NO, NO, HOLDING, HOLDING, HOLDING, YES, NO, 
    HOLDING, HOLDING, HOLDING, YES,

----

It is important to signal that you are ""HOLDING"" the asset, because it prevents it from buying again (with money you wouldn't have). You can see the boolean logic below that prevents it.

Here's the actual full program:

[This is what part of the program output looks like.](http://lavancier.com/pictures/program_output.png)

So again, this is a really simple example. It could be a lot more complicated, because just a few things that you can make variable based on the data are:

1. Holding duration

2. Trade size

3. Adding different algorithms and deciding priority.

So for example you could trade on all days that have a historical volatility between x and y. Calculate through the array by doing such:

----

        double HistVol_period [900-21] = {};
        for (int z = 0; z &lt; 900; z++) {
            int y = 0;
            for (int x = 0 + z; x &lt; 21 + z; x++) {
                residuals[y] = (stock_prices[x] / stock_prices[x+1]) - 1;
                y++;
            } // this segment finds the residuals for each day and inputs them into HistVol_period, which is done in a for loop for every single day.
            
            double resid_mean = 1;
            for (int x = 0; x &lt; 21; x++) {
                resid_mean = resid_mean + residuals[x];
            } // get the mean of the residuals
            resid_mean = (resid_mean - 1) / 21;
            
            double resid_minus_mean [21] = {};
            for (int x = 0; x &lt; 21; x++) {
                resid_minus_mean[x] = residuals[x] - resid_mean;
            }
            double squared [21] = {};
            for (int x = 0; x &lt; 21; x++) {
                squared[x] = pow(resid_minus_mean[x], 2);
            } // squaring individual residuals.
            double variance = 0;
            for (int x = 0; x &lt; 21; x++) {
                variance = variance + squared[x];
            } // this is the effective variance.
            variance = variance / 21;
            double std_dev = pow(variance, 0.5);
            double HistVol = std_dev*pow(251, 0.5);
            
            HistVol_period[z] = HistVol; // this is not cout'ed. All we want is to make an array of HistVol.
        }

----

EDIT: Also a quick note, if you want to get formatted data for the array, [click here](http://lavancier.com/get_data_simple.php?ticker=SPY&amp;interval=921). Make sure though if you use a different interval to change the array size in C++.

I recently attended a working meeting with an investment firm in my area. We were institutionally investing funds for an organization where I am on the board. I am just jumping into investing as of last year and doing my homework. I'm also a programmer and love working with data. 

My plan was to put together a dataset by collecting EOD data for stock markets and then use the SEC EDGAR database to create financial ratios such as p/e, price to book, price to sales etc. 

My question is whether or not there are active datasets that you can recommend which are free or for purchase? I'm sure a Reuters or Bloomberg terminal would do this however they are a little expensive.

15-01-13,Have some money put aside for a down payment for a house. Is it worth trying to invest it in a safe way if I only have a 1-2 year span before I need it?,"My girlfriend and I (25) are looking into getting a small house in the near future, both of us are saving and our families have offered to help a little on the down payment. I've been putting aside a portion of my monthly budget for the purpose of putting towards the payment on the house. The time table for that is sometime between 10 - 20 months most likely so not looking for anything long term at all. Got about 6k in it right now and should have at least 10k in it before I need to withdraw it.  Right now it's in a savings account earning basically nothing in interest and so I was wondering if there's a better option that could get me a little something extra or if I'm better of not risking anything and just keeping it in savings. 

As for investing I'm still pretty much a beginner, besides a 401k have an account with Vanguard with a Roth IRA and a few index funds. I don't know if a short term bond or some safe ETFs or something would be worth it if I might be pulling the money in less than a year or two. Thanks!",9

...though I don't doubt we will see higher stock market values I'm just confused where the money will come from, because the average 20-30 year old today is not going to be making, at least in terms of purchasing power, what our parents made...

15-01-13,"I'm starting an ESL (TEFL) school with a friend, and we have a potential investor; I want to offer a percentage of profits as the investor's return. Is there a standard calculation for this?","As the title says, a friend and I will be opening a school in the near future. We are not so far down the line that we have completely worked out the initial outlay to get the school running and marketed yet, so I was wondering, is there a standard formula available to set the investors rate of return (for example, if the investor offers us 15% of our initial expenses, what would they expect in return)? Or is there an average rate of return 'x' for investment 'y'?

I understand that this is typically negotiated, but I was looking for a marker to start with and make sure both sides are getting a good deal.

Pardon my use of terminology, I'll be the first to admit I'm not an expert in this field. But I want to be fair without giving too much away. I think a percentage of profits is fairer than a set annual sum, and I also don't want to offer too much control; I was thinking of suggesting an adviser role (I will of course explain possible risk/liability that such a role could incur) as this person does have some expertise in school management so their knowledge could be useful, but I don't want a 'back-seat-manager', as it were, trying to influence the business too much, either.    

Also: I assume it is standard practice to make our accounts visible to them? At what point do they receive their return, before or after tax? Do investors have to help pay for day to day expenditure such as building maintenance and new equipment? Does the investment guarantee that return forever? Or will their return diminish if we become more successful over time?

Lastly, any sources provided to back up any information would be wonderful! So that I in turn could show the investor if needs be.

I apologise for all the questions, especially if any of them have been asked before. I did use the search function first to see if any of these questions had been answered previously, but I couldn't find any answers.

Here's the simple answer to investing in oil. There's no one set outcome. This really irritates me because people think it's just a way to get rich quick. Most people just think, 1. Buy up a ton of cheap small cap oil stocks 2. OILLLL ETFZZZ!! 3. PROFIT!1!!one!1!

But truthfully, that's not the case. Most of these traded companies, especially small-mid caps who are or are about to be in crippling debt aren't going to be around for much longer. These cycles are known to flush out many companies, and you'd probably hate to realize that $3 dollar stock which used to be $25, could just as easily continue to go to $0.50 a share. But this still begs the question. Could you profit from this drop? Very possibly, though it's not guaranteed, as is most investing. But if you want to take the leap into the risk (which I am doing myself) at least do it smart. Here's a good way to approach it.

1. Pick specific companies.
- NO, and I mean NO ETFs. You must know exactly what producers you're holding, and with 2-3 of the companies in an etf crashing from terrible earnings, loss of investor confidence, debt, etc., you're pretty much guaranteed a hefty loss.
Pick winners who have the following!
1. Reserve Cash

2. A market cap $30 Billion or ^

3. A long history, preferably one that's gone through multiple cycles like this.

4. Dividend is a plus too (Just in case it takes a while for things to get going again)

Here are some great examples. 

Low risk - XOM, CVX, RDS.A, TOT

Medium risk - OXY (Currently holding), BP, STO

&lt;DANGER ZONE&gt;

High risk (Avoid these) - GDP, SN, ALDW, USO, UCO, OIL (+100s more)


So here's the moral. Stay clear of both risky companies and etfs. Invest only in companies you feel comfortable with. Will you see a return? Most likely, but it's never guaranteed. That's what you most definitely need to comprehend before you put money in. Oil could go even lower, $40, $35, $30, who knows. Just be careful, rational, and hold long. Best of luck!",48
15-01-14,"Wells Fargo Brokerage Account, gifted KO stock reinvesting dividends - $115.00 year end fee. Scottrade suggestions?","I've got a WF brokerage account with some KO stock that was gifted to me when I graduated (184 shares CMV $7,800). The only account activity is that dividends are being reinvested however at YE WF dinged my checking account for $115.00 (for what I assume is the fee, but that's almost as much as the dividends I received for the year!)

15-01-14,$45 Oil — What it really means.,"The western media would have us believe; that slowing oil demand, globally and especially in China; combined with the recent shale revolution in North America; and the Saudis concern over market share; are the main reasons for the large recent price drop in oil. Crude oil was trading over $100/barrel as recently as July; prices have more than halved (-55%) in the last few quarters, while global supply has slightly exceeded demand by less than 1%, — something doesn’t add up!

This is financial war with Iran, Venezuela and primarily Russia. The US is using its monopoly on the paper markets, where the price is set in USD, to manipulate prices lower causing instability in these heavily oil dependent countries and put extreme pressure on their leaders. Their contrived efforts to artificially push the prices down is exactly what they do in other commodity markets (Gold/Silver), which I have previously outlined in another article. Blowback from low oil prices will see the US shale sector in a very vulnerable position, as well as Canada’s tar sands. These marginal producers will see drastic layoffs, cutbacks in project expansions and large debt defaults, — if the price remains low for an extended period.

My usual trades are purely financial, and I just see a spot in the market where I can make some money, and then trade. 

One of the companies has an annual webcast/event where they welcome owners of the product and shareholders to come and hear about new ventures and to hear concerns. I really want to attend one of these meetings just for the entertainment quality. Unlike most shareholder meetings, this event is filled with new tech and announcements of new opportunities. 

The other cool feature of being a share-holder, is that I can pay a small price to receive a physical stock certificate to hang on my wall...I know that mind sound boring to some but to me, they're art.

Anyway, OptionsHouse is merging with tradeMONSTER in two weeks. I recently learned that its dirt-cheap commission fee of $4.75/stock trade will be permanently increasing after the platform change (the OptionsHouse staff said they didn't have a new price as of yet during my call a few days ago), so these are the last days to snag it. A couple current deals are:

Throw in $1,000 upon account opening and you get 100 commission-free trades.

Throw in $5,000 and you get 150 commission-free trades.

The unused free trades expire in 60 days and I think the money needs to be added within one or two months of account opening.

I have a referral link if you'd like to help me get 30 free trades. If it works out, I'd be glad to send a cash-equivalent cut of it your way for helping me out. Alternatively, or on top of that, I'd be happy to walk you through everything that the OptionsHouse platform is capable of as it currently is, though the tradeMONSTER platform will be just as new to me as it is to anyone not already familiar with it.

If higher systematic risk means higher average returns, then will 100% stocks always earn more then a stock/bond mix if held for enough decades?

If I keep following this line of thought, then why not pick 100% small caps for even more risk? Or 100% emerging markets?

My intuition is that for some standard deviation 40 years is not long enough, but when is that true?

15-01-14,The trouble with buying oil ETFs right now,"I've been seeing a lot of people talk about buying oil and gas company ETF's lately as the horde of people looking to call a bottom becomes bigger and it has me a bit concerned that this could be the wrong move and here's why:

**Balance sheets matter!**

Oil and gas companies operate hugely expensive equipment in order to perform their tasks and because of this, many of the smaller organizations are heavily levered with tremendous amounts of debt. These are the companies that are going to default on their bond holders, cut their dividends, and go through a bankruptcy once their price hedging is exhausted.

The trouble with ETFs is that they do not make any distinction among which companies have better debt ratios among their peers. ETF's will scoop up the good with the bad, and until we start hearing more estimate cuts, downgrades, etc, we have limited insight into which are the bad companies that are likely to be dissolved. We saw this happen with Seadrill and will almost certainly see this some more.

My point here is that while ETFs are generally a great way to diversify within a sector, I believe that that is exactly the wrong approach with oil right now. If there ever was a time to inspect a companies 10K and listen to their conference calls, now is the time. With oil ETFs, you risk scooping up (possibly) a LOT of bad along with (possibly) few good companies.

15-01-14,"Former trader/investor/hedge fund person, somebody told me you may be interested in a start-up I'm working on","Hey Redditors,


Long time redditor here, 3 years club or so (can verify with a mod if need be). I was told by a mutual friend that my start-up might interest some people here...so I'm looking for some beta testers. If you don’t want to beta test, feel free to ask me anything about my trading/investing background. It’s a way I can give back to those who have been so generous to me.


As for my background, I was a professional trader at both a bank and a hedge fund. I've traded everything from exotic equity derivatives, equities, bonds, commodities, fx, etc. you name it. I've done it both quantitatively and qualitatively. Before trading I was a web developer and before that I did chemistry research. I left my hedge fund to take some time off and to take my institutional background and help out individuals. 


I started exploring my old favorites like Yahoo Finance, and realized there were ads everywhere! The site hadn’t changed in 11 years (I have graphic proof of this). Not only that, it seemed like they hired a team from buzzfeed to write articles…I think it’s fine when clickbait is “cats not doing Christmas” but when it’s a person’s money…that bothers me.

Another anecdote is a friend of mine was on a hugely popular financial tv channel (we’ve all watched it) and they do pre-tv interviews. He told them in the pre-interview he thinks markets are giving bearish signals and they openly asked him not to say it because it hurts ratings.

In finance, I don’t think , “don’t be evil” is good enough – it’s too passive. I think we have a responsibility to “actively do good.” I ultimately want my website’s ecosystem to educate people and make them richer for the good of people fulfilling their dreams. My goal with this ecosystem is to elevate everybody’s financial knowledge in a way they care about. When I was at the fund, people would call me the nicest person they ever met on wall street.  And I told people, there are many of us…we just don’t make for a good story. So yes, I truly am about making peoples' dreams come true and this isn’t some PR stuff. 

My philosophy is that if everybody is richer, they can take care of their basic needs, and it will be easier to help them on their path to happiness.

Anyway, that’s my spiel. 

So I'm looking for a few people to use my site and help document what they liked/didn't like. For right now, I want it to be an alternative to Yahoo Finance and the like. I want to create a product that people will actually use and not for it to be a “cool concept.”

Now my site, as of today, is out there so you really don't have to agree to send me feedback. In fact here is a link if you desire: [http://www.tiingo.com](http://tiingo.com)


Some features it offers over yahoo finance:

* Streaming news

* Real-time chat system

* Keyboard shortcuts (press and hold shift key)

* Extensive database of financials

* Bespoke beta and correlation calculations

* And more


Please forgive any bugs…this isn’t a complete product and I need friendly people to help test it. Right now it’s been mostly friends.


So I would love to hear your documented thoughts. Right now I purposely don't have a new user introduction, as I want to see what people struggle with and try to make it intuitive.

15-01-14,"A reminder for all the ""oil gonna get me rich"" geniuses here","The front month Brent contract is trading at 46.57. The 6th contract is trading at 52.32. The 12th contract is trading at 57.92.

Let's assume oil goes up to $80 a year from now. You'd make something like 40% *only if you buy the 12 month contract today*. If you buy ETFs/ETNs that are just giving you front month contracts, you're going to get your dick bit off by possibly the most contango heavy environment I've ever seen for oil. You are losing roughly $1/mo just in roll costs for a typically backwardated commodity. This means that if oil doesn't go anywhere, literally doesn't change at all, you are losing 2%/mo just for being in the market.

Good luck.",373

15-01-15,Why does it seem so easy?,"I'm a total newbie in investing, and half of the words people use when it comes to the subject are completely alien to me.

I got the idea in my head tuesday afternoon that it would be fun to try investing with real money, ive been interested for a while now and have done some research but really know as close to nothing.

last week I opened a demo account with plus500, my virtual 20000 was my learning book, but i kind of just randomly invested around.

I read about the 25 euro joining bonus and decided to try it, for fun.

25 euro's on tuesday afternoon is 300 euro's now. Profits all made by investing in oil, and then waiting till it's just a bit higher. 

What am I missing? because it just seems to straight forward?

15-01-14,Platform / Broker Combo,"Looking for thoughts on different platforms and the correlating brokers.

Would love the ability to buy/sell from the graph itself, but not a requirement.


Charts interested in currently:
TC2000 (havent used - only seen videos)
Etrade's (havent used)
Thinkorswim - TDAmeritrade (used, like, have a few things id like different)



more importantly, i'm looking for a buy/sell platform to work off with valid brokers. Speed of transaction/fill is crucial, a good Level II is crucial - easy to work with limit orders.... preferably the ability to click order from the Level II itself would be great, but not required.


Style of trading:
day trading - my trades usually last less than 10minutes, most around 2mins.

I'd love to use TC2000 but unsure the plat buy/sell platform to use since TC2000 doesnt currently support any brokers (tradefire coming soon, but they charge a decent rate).

I've heard of ROX and APPTRADER for the buy/sell platform, but havent seen a way to get my hands on it without joining certain groups. 




Right now i'm looking to settle on interactive broker for both charting and brokering, but their demo just doesnt jive with me. i worry that their buy/sell rates are just slow and the charting is usable, but not exactly crisp and fluid.


thoughts on something to pair with TC2000? Looking for a per-share charge for broker fee rather than a flat rate. I do a lot of trail closing, so those flat rates murder me.",8

Account value $9,947.  

I am an imperfect trader. While the account is 1k higher than Monday, it would be way higher if I had:  
Held the AAL short to today. Unfortunately I closed it on the early signs of strength yesterday.  
UNG - what a big bounce there, yesterday I closed the Jan16 15 calls for a stupid reason, probably a trader's fear based on nothing, but I quickly realized my error and put $600 on the UNG Jan23 15 call, which I sold today at the open and then watched it go straight up all day. Left 1k+ on the table :(  

But, I made up for it by making some buys in energy.  
More XOP - Oil&amp;gas exploration and production ETF  
EMES (Emerge Energy - producer of fracking sand)  
RSX (Russia ETF, which is correlated with the oil price) and a reentry in USO (which I had sold yesterday on yesterday's afternoon bounce)  

And OKE - Oneok, a vertically integrated natural gas company. I found this using an incredible twitter resource, @WallStJesus. He tweets unusual options activity, every day, and I have found it to be extremely useful info. Today he tweeted that options activity on OKE was running 15x normal. I take a look at the chart and it is on a support level that dates back to 2012. Bought the 42.5 call, Feb20, when the stock was at 40.20, and had a 58% gain by the close. Planning to hold it. [OKE tweets](http://imgur.com/BmSVg35)

TWTR, BABA, FEYE, CEMP - So I am not completely in stocks that need a bounce in oil. I love BABA under 100. TWTR, FEYE, and CEMP are acting just fine in my opinion. I don't see a reason to sell them.  

CEMP in particular is super strong, they just did a secondary at 24.50 and it was gobbled up. Stock is well above the secondary price and that's bullish.",6

Accdoing to [this article](http://www.cnbc.com/id/101321938#.) Last year 82.5 million cars were sold. 

Assuming the gigafactory goes to plan it we would still need ALOT more batteries. As it stands the gigafactory will only allow for a .6% electrification of vehicles. 
 
Most big automakers are also starting to show all electric cars, like the chevy Bolt (200 miles) and nissan is also coming out with a competitor, BMW is doing the i8 and i3. 


Based on this I believe we will a very sharp rise in demand for Li-ion

15-01-16,"21, senior in college, maxed roth IRA and looking for other tax-advantaged opportunities","Hi guys,

A little about me: I'm 21, about to graduate from university and will be starting at a top management consulting shop in august. Comp is 72k 
base + 10k sign on + % as end of year bonus.

I'm looking for a strategy where I can park 25k and have tax benefits. I'm thinking about opening up a 529 account for myself for potential business school (if I hate consulting and need to hit the reset button). Would that be a wise decision? If I decide that I really enjoy the career path that I'm currently on, and go for partner, could I then use that 529 account for kids that I may have going forward?

What are y'alls thoughts?",4
15-01-15,[Novice] Confused about Sharpe Ratio,"Today I learned about the Sharpe Ratio as a way to measure risk, but I'm still struggling with the concept.  It doesn't help that it varies drastically with the time frame, so figuring out what a reasonable value is is proving difficult.  Hopefully you guys can help.  I've made up some example data to simplify my questions.

Strategy | Sharpe Ratio | Expected Return
---|---|---
Data 1 | 0.81 | 12.59%
Data 2 | 0.81 | 5.53%
Data 3| 1.54 | 5.53%
Data 4 | 0.21 | 4.94%

Now I have a few questions:

* Between Data 1 and Data 2, is there any reason to use Data 2?  Data 1 has equal risk ratio and higher return.

* Between Data 2 and Data 3,  is there any reason to use Data 2?  Data 3 has less risk ratio and equal return.

* Between Data 3 and Data 4, is there any reason to use Data 4?  It's weak in both categories.

* Can we use the above data to determine anything else?  Or were the above questions completely unanswerable without some other form of data?

* Are there any other Risk measurement metrics I should be aware of?  Currently all I know of are Margin of Error calculations and Sharpe Ratio.

Thanks in advance for the help!",2
15-01-15,Bullish on Unilife (UNIS),"I'm chilling in Australia with some friends who are very bullish on this stock and I'm looking for some second opinions. Some background on the company; Unilife is a pharma tech company that manufactures wearable injectors and advanced injection systems. They recently announced partnerships with Sanofi, Novartis, and Opthotech  (the latter is a 1 billion deal) that will guarantee the company a healthy source of income for the foreseeable future. On top of that the company just brought on David Hastings as their new CFO which seems to indicate that the company is aiming to achieve the some fairly robust growth (http://ir.unilife.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=890797). Overall the stock has has risen nearly 100% over the last month and has had near daily gains of 5% over the last week which leads me to believe that something is going on in the background that the announcements alone cannot account for. I'm hoping someone with more knowledge of pharma trends can postulate whats happening!",0
15-01-16,How do brokerages handle in-the-money options at expiration dates if no action is taken from the customer?,"I'm relatively new to options trading. I spoke with Etrade today about this and the rep seemed to go back and forth on his answer, only to put me on hold for a few minutes to come back with a different answer. 

I am wondering how brokerages handle in-the-money options at expiration dates if no action is taken from the customer? 

For a call option,  since the contract is to buy the stocks I would imagine they would go ahead and execute the trade, but what if your options contact was to buy $80,000 worth of a stock when you only have $10,000 worth of buying power? 

Do brokerages execute your options regardless of your buying power? Would they close your position and sell the option so you don't lose money? Or do they still expire worthless? 

The answer given by the guy at etrade said they go ahead and execute the trade regardless. Does this sound right? Does anyone have experience with this? 

Also same question for puts. I currently have 50 put options contacts for BAC Jan17 $16. So does this mean if I do nothing I would have an $80,000 dollar short position on BAC? 


Thanks",2
15-01-15,Investing in batteries,"I was reading [this article] (http://www.technologyreview.com/news/526126/does-musks-gigafactory-make-sense/) on MIT Review about Tesla's Gigafactory. It states that the factory will double the global production of Lithium Ion batteries. Enough for 500K cars per year. 

Accdoing to [this article](http://www.cnbc.com/id/101321938#.) Last year 82.5 million cars were sold. 

Assuming the gigafactory goes to plan it we would still need ALOT more batteries. As it stands the gigafactory will only allow for a .6% electrification of vehicles. 
 
Most big automakers are also starting to show all electric cars, like the chevy Bolt (200 miles) and nissan is also coming out with a competitor, BMW is doing the i8 and i3. 


Based on this I believe we will a very sharp rise in demand for Li-ion 
batteries. 


What would be the best way to invest in this trend?

I have about 5,000 in school loans and will eventually have more in a few years when i finish school (doing 2 years of community college and 2 years of state school so i should not be in the hole too bad)

Anyways i was hoping to take the $5,000 i saved up, put it away for 5+ years and use it when im a little older. I plan on adding to this investment over the next few years also. 

At first i considered CDs but didnt think &lt;2% APY would justify not being able to touch my money for 5 years. 

I have done a bit of research and still feel clueless on what exactly to invest in but the general consensus seems that putting it into a fund like vanguard would be my best best.

Over the long term can i expect to see a reasonable return if im patient and keep my money in as long as i have to? Are there any sub divisions of vangaurd i put my money into or is it just one big fund for different stocks and bonds? Thanks for any of the replies you guy are super helpful.

15-01-15,Thoughts on values based investing? (AMAGX),"This is my first post in r/investing.

I'm a Muslim convert who has always been interested in finance and investing. When I became Muslim I had to shift the way I approached investing and my bank accounts since interest is forbidden in Islam (so no bonds, CDs, interest based loans). We are also not allowed to invest in certain types of companies such as alcohol, Tabaco, pornography, finance companies, as well as companies that take on too much debt. Before I go on I just want to clarify that there are a broad spectrum of Muslims with a variety of opinions and I am not passing judgment on others who choose a different way.

Long story short, the perfect solution for me was to go with Amana Mutual funds by Saturna Capital. Its a values based mutual fund that invests according to Muslim values such as the ones I mentioned above. I started investing in about mid 2008 and wanted to hear your thoughts about Values based investing in general, and how you think AMAGX which is a growth fund has performed vs the general market and other values based funds.

15-01-16,Gift Exchange... Worth The Risk?,"Hello fellow Redditors! Not sure if subreddit I'm posting to is correct (let me know so I can repost elsewhere), but I definitely need some help here and not sure if I should invest in it.

I recently was invited to something called Gift Exchange. Its where you put down $1000 in a 'gift exchange,' then within two or three weeks you get $8000 back in cash from your group 'gift exchange.' Here's how I  was told it works:

You start with your base line with eight people at the bottom (people that are recently recruited) and they pay forward $1000. You then have to recruit two more people, and then they recruit two more people etc, so now you're on top of the gift exchange pyramid. This allows you to receive $8000. 
After you are on top of the pyramid, you would then have to put forward another $1000, and recruit two more people, and it repeats itself.
The reason why they  call it a gift exchange, is because when you receive the $8000 from 8 different people, you give them a $10 gift card (this is so you won't get taxed as this is received as a gift on both ends).

This was between two very good friends of my boyfriends and I. They are ALWAYS investing their money in many different ways and trying to earn money. So far they've been doing pretty well (they have a kid so I can see why they need all the money they can get).

Sorry if I haven't explained it very well, as there's not really many information online about it.

Is this something I should be wary about? They said that I'm not obligated to stay in the group, and I can remove myself any time and receive my money back.

As most things are, it seems too good to be true.

15-01-15,My Profiting MW Technique for Penny Stocks (Not Disclosed Yet),"Hi! Nice to meet you guys here. This is my first post on stocks! I do this because I found the MW technique (invented by me and coupled up with several indicators) very accurate for playing stocks, at least for me, and I want to share with other investors.

I am not going to explain what the MW technique for penny stocks is for now. Instead, I am going to show you three stocks and their patterns that I have played with, then you my friend, the reader, try to contemplate on some phenomenal features on the patterns and to give a guess on what the technique contains. I will disclose the MW technique in my next post.

Unfortunately, I can't post images here but I need to show you guys the graphs. So I opened a blog and you can read the graphs directly from the following link:

I am a recent grad (December '14) and am interviewing for a Corporate Financial Analyst position. I have already passed through the first two rounds (phone interview, and a super day). And now I am tasked with preparing and presenting a 15-20 min presentation to a panel of Directors. I was not given specific details concerning what kind of presentation, but I assume they would like me to prepare an investment pitch.

Any feedback is appreciated, but most importantly I would like to know:

1. Would you guys actively use this tool?

2. If not why? 

3. If you would use it, would you pay for additional features?

15-01-15,Using the Calendar and Catalysts to Your Trading Advantage,"One of the biggest things that I look for when examining a new position, be it for my investment newsletter PowerTrend Profits or for The Thematic Growth Portfolio that I manage for Fabian Wealth Strategies, I’m always looking for catalysts. These are the events, meetings or product launches that can be real tipping points for a company and its shares. In fact, laying out a calendar of what’s ahead over the coming months and what kind of news is likely to emerge is one of the first things I do once an investment candidate passes my multi-layered screening process.

Let me share with you an example of one such catalyst that just passed.

Last week there was much discussion regarding on-again concerns about Greece, the dollar and monetary policy, but the Internet and the blogosphere have been simply humming with the “latest and greatest“ announcements coming out of the 2015 Consumer Electronic Show (CES). This show happens every year, and if you’ve never been before, to say it is an extravaganza would be an understatement. Against the backdrop of Las Vegas, corporate briefings and parties and the near-nonstop wave of press releases, it can be like drinking from the fire hose.

What you have to remember is despite all the glitz, at its core the show is a giant preview of what’s to come later this year — in some cases even further out.

Much like movie previews, some companies have some really cool things, others show all that they have and leave that empty feeling after, while yet others simply make you go “huh?”

From an investor’s perspective, it’s always good to see the direction in which consumer electronics and the key ingredients — semiconductors, displays, sensors and so on — are headed. Just remember not to fall into the hype of what’s being announced, particularly if it is being touted as the best thing since sliced bread from a company that most have never heard of.

Pulling the lens back a bit, for a conference that used to focus so much on the latest, greatest, thinnest and most powerful laptops and smartphones, there was far more talk about cars, the home, wearables, drones, speakers and more.

For example, Ford (F) CEO Mark Fields stated that he expects to see self-driving cars on our nation’s roads by the end of the decade. Adding some potential credence to this statement, Dieter Zetsche, the head of Mercedes-Benz cars and chairman of Daimler AG (DDAIY), focused most of his CES keynote address on unveiling a fully autonomous prototype vehicle.

Now, according to consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co., the average car already holds $350 or so in semiconductor content, with roughly $600 in a hybrid electric car and about $1,000 in a high-end luxury vehicle.

But let’s think more about this and the notion of the driverless car. In order for that to happen, a number of new systems need to be working inside the car or truck. It means innovations like tires embedded with microelectromechanical systems that monitor road traction and adjust braking, enhanced night vision and mapping, among other things. In other words, more sensors and more semiconductors will be making their way into cars.

Underneath the hood, it means there will be a spike in the amount of data sensed, processed and collected by these electronic brains on wheels. That will drive demand for companies like Freescale (FSL), Texas Instruments (TXN) and ARM Holdings (ARMH) during the coming years.

Connectivity, particularly mobile connectivity, is right up Qualcomm’s (QCOM) alley, and I see the soon-to-be-closed acquisition of Bluetooth company CSR (CSRE) as bolstering Qualcomm’s long-term position in this arena. Near-term, Wall Street keeps upping its December quarter shipment expectations for Apple’s iPhone, which now stand at 69 million units — up double-digit percentages year over year! That’s great for Qualcomm’s chip and licensing business and great for QCOM shares as these other aspects of the Connected Home, Connected Car and the Internet of Things begin to take off.",1

15-01-16,I got some money which I want to invest reasonably,"I got about 30k of which I want to keep maybe 5k to myself for living expenses and such, and the rest of it, 25k, I want to invest reasonably. Meaning I want profits, at least more than the inflation consumes, but I also want it to be relatively save. Most of it used to be in pension funds which performed badly, less than 0% growth in the last two years and the dividends were also not great, about 1% I think. 

So I thought about it and came to the conclusion that while I find stocks interesting they might be too risky and it would also not be possible to distribute the risk equally. I still have two candidates now though which I consider buying, Berkshire Hathaway B and Blackstone  and while they're stocks I think they're also investment groups which hold lots of different stocks, etc. and distribute the risk this way which makes their stock safer than say a bank stock. 

I also thought about funds. Technology orientated ones strike me as interesting and there have also been some which were very profitable in the past years however they also seem to be quite risky. I thought about investing some money, not too much though, there. Energy fonds, especially those investing in newer methods, also are interesting to me and are often less risky than the tech funds.

I also thought about leaving some money in my pension funds, just a part of it, knowing that it's relatively safe. 

Just for clarification: I need most of this money for the future, I want profits, yes but safety is also quite important.

Would be nice if you could tell me what you think about some of the ideas I named and if you have some which might be of use for me I'd be happy to hear them. ",0

15-01-15,Why i think cramer is wrong to be so bullish on the US,"stems from him talking his mouth off in front of multiple screens saying ""why we're #1""

- ultimately what shows a fundamental improvement in the US economy is people buying more stuff which is a function of them earning more. However, hourly wages have gone up sub 1% each month in the last year, which is in-line with the pace since the recovery began in 2009

- people talk about unemployment but a. a lot is low wage creating and b. a lot comes from people dropping out of the labor market

- if the fed bought the argument that the US is doing well, they would raise rates. However, a. the fed looks at hourly wages and b. with a stronger USD, there's a greater chance of deflation which makes rate hikes a lower probability event

It's just from a relative perspective that the USD is safer than other assets thats propping it up.

15-01-16,Questions about Roth TSP and Roth IRA and Others,"I have just recently started getting serious about my retirement although I have been contributing to my Traditional TSP from Day 1 (unfortunately I made the simple choice of the G fund for about 3 years). So first a little about me:

Age: 27

Occupation: Engineer

Salary: $75,980.00

Job Security: Very Secure

TSP Contribution: 5%

TSP Employer Matching: 5%

Marital Status: Unmarried

Extra Income: $1200/month rent from additional roommates

Total Monthly Income: $4800.00


Current TSP Allocations:

Fund	Percentage	Balance

C Fund: 	50%		$8391.60

S Fund:	30%		$5034.95

I Fund:	20%		$3356.63


		Total: $16783.18

I just recently discovered the Roth TSP option and have started contributing 5% of my paycheck to the Roth TSP instead of 5% to the Traditional TSP. In addition to my take home paycheck of $1800 I have two roommates in a house I bought that pay me $600 a piece ($1200 total) a month rent so they take care of my mortgage. I haven’t opened a Roth IRA outside of my TSP but I would like to do that this year. Below are questions I have that I wanted to get you guys/girls advice on:


1. Should I try to max out my Roth TSP for 2015 or just contribute the 5% each paycheck and just let it ride? If so, what is the limit?
2. If I max out my Roth TSP can I continue to contribute to the traditional TSP and still have 5% matching by my employer?
3. Does the Roth TSP contribute to my yearly maximum contribution ($5500) to a Roth IRA or are the two unrelated?
4. If the Roth TSP and Roth IRA are different, which is more important to contribute to? Which one typically has a higher Return on Investment (ROI)?

I also have:
 ~$180k in debt on the house I bought @4.25% fixed 30 yr mortgage

~$28k in debt on 4.21 acres of land @3.5% over 12 yrs

I have started an emergency fund contributing $600/month until I reach $10k

Allowing myself an allowance of $600/month for whatever I want to buy

Adding $800/month additional principal to my mortgage

And once I get done playing with the numbers I'm going to start contributing $500/month to an outside Roth IRA account ($5500/year maxed out). The last month will be a nonpayment of $500 which I will use for Christmas gifts. 

Does anyone have any concerns with my plan or can answer any of the questions above? Thanks for any help in advance you could provide!

Like many others, I do my banking and insurance through USAA and took advantage of their free financial advice in the past.  I was largely ignorant of the financial world, so they set me up with a target retirement account (URFRX) several years back, and I’ve been making my contributions and watching it without too much interest.  I’m starting to notice and understand the numbers, and would like to make better choices.

The first thing I want to do is lower my expense ratio significantly.  URFRX has an expense ratio (0.86%) that is very high compared to the often recommended VTSMX (0.17%).

I had planned to move my investments to Vanguard until I came across a post here about [USAA brokerage accounts opening up under Fidelity.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2ekj5n/psa_changes_at_usaa_brokerage/)

USAA is comfortable to me, and I think it would be a great place to open my first brokerage account and get my toes wet with actual investing.
I’d like to buy into a few well managed, low expense index funds and see how things go for a while.  My goal is to have relatively safe vehicle that I can cash out in 20-25 years.

* Is there anything fundamentally wrong with this plan?
* Is VTSMX still highly recommended?  It seems to have done so well, and swelled to an enormous size that I feel like it’s almost ‘too late’ or ‘too risky’ to put money there.  Is this an incorrect line of thinking?
* There are some available funds that are just puzzling to me - such as [SMARX](https://www.google.com/finance?q=MUTF%3ASMARX&amp;ei=ZMq5VOq8GISViQKD-YHoCQ).  This fund shows a Gross Expense Ratio of 0.80% and a Net Expense Ratio of 0%.  It’s mostly bonds, but the annualized returns look great.  The price has basically flatlined though.  What am I missing about this?  How can it have a 5 star Morningstar rating?  Why would anyone recommend this fund?
* FSTVX looks incredibly interesting as well.  How can the expense ratio be 0.05% compared to VTSMX and appear incredibly similar?  Is that the Fidelity equivalent?
* Can anyone explain in better detail why the OP of the link above bolded 3 funds specifically?  (FSGDX, FSTVX, FSITX)

I’ve got a hundred more questions, but I think I should just stop there.  If anyone is willing to attempt answering any of these – I’d greatly appreciate it!

Hey /r/wallstreetbets! It's been two weeks since my first post so I decided to do an update on how my picks are doing. As of today at 10am, my portfolio was up 7.56%.

* AGEN bought at $4.03, currently at $5.59.

AGEN actually hit $6.31 last Monday and I considered selling, but decided not to. It's come down since then, but I still think it has the potential to reach $7. I don't know, maybe I'm being stupid. We'll see.

* ARRY bought at $4.85, currently $4.37.

Not much to note here. I'm still holding on to it, we'll see which direction it goes in.

* DDD bought at $31.37, currently $28.48.

This is currently my big loss. The CES showcase didn't help the stock price whatsoever, but I'm still holding on because I believe the 3D printing industry is going to get a boost at some point in 2015. This is a long play.

* GASE bought at $.022, currently $.03.

This stock has been flipping back and forth between .02 and .03 in the past two weeks. Still holding, we'll see what happens.

I'm not getting cocky yet, don't worry. I'm still pretty concerned about DDD and GASE, but I haven't sold any of my holdings yet. I paid $1,552 for my stocks, and they are currently valued at $1,636.

15-01-16,BEWARE: Chapter 11 Restructuring!!!,"Wow what an adventure. Very strange. So meme worthy. I do not even know where to begin.

Infact, the weirdness is so off the wall that I become curious as to whether or not I need to backaway. You know, run? Fear for my fine and dandy reputation in life? Maybe keep a watch out over night to keep a close eye on just what's going on here anyhow..

Back in October I spotted a situation -- an investable situation. If you even know what that word means. This company, a major player in the Solar Industry, was nearly put out of business by a gnarly series of days where they spent and spent -- to the tune of one milion dollars a day -- and made practically zero revenues to compensate. Basically, the management of the Company were doing exactly the wrong stuff to succeed.

They did one thing right, though.l They filed for Chapter 11 Restructuring Bankruptcy. This is a special type of bankruptcy designed for Company's to get around costly legal battles. Its a pretty unique device under the law. Its like being able to file a lawsuit to escape a contract without having to go through the proper civil litigation procedures. There is of course a proper set of procedures -- but the advantage of Chapter 11 is that they (the legislators) make it easy to get infront of a Judge who will rule and perform a type of mediation in settling major contract disputes that otherwise may take several years in the ""normal"" route.

So Chapter 11 (Restructuring) is interesting because it helps folks get out of bad contracts. The thing is though, there has been much abuse of the Chapter 11 process. All of the abuse of course has been covered up -- its mostly the investors who got screwed who even know about the abuse. And even then, most people are not very savvy of the law -- so they think their company legitimately went bankrupt. But that's simply not always the case of Chapter 11. And nor is it the primary purpose of this special bankruptcy law. The main purpose is to faciliate company's escape from contractual obligations which didn't work out, but which will be hard for each Company to negotiate out of without being infront of a Judge who gives that essential 3rd vote.

What's the Abuse though? Well, simply, when Company Management enters into Chapter 11 they have the opportunity to sell the Company to a new set of bidders. Highly hypothetical, of course, this isn't an accusation of any sort on any particular Company, but I'll tell you this. A cursory review of the Chapter 11 History reveals that a very many Companies have wiped out Shareholders (public investors like you and I, incl. big investors in the common stock), reissued new stock (which happened to be bought and awarded to those who held Bonds), and emerged to be very successful.

Of course, all of that ""successful"" came at the price of wiping out all of the public shareholders. Like all of the folks who are down in paper (or real, if they sold) losses of $2k - $12 million (just talking about investors I know of in one particular Chapter 11 situation). So the shareholders get wiped out while Management stays on board and gets stock options in the ""new shares"" of the Company. Its pretty sick, if you think about it.

Well, I'm involved in one of these Chapter 11 situations because I saw the opportunity for some old-fashioned by-the-book street justice. And now the lawyers for this (what was) a $1.4 billion dollar company are after me. 

Its an unprecedented situation.

15-01-16,Should I sell all my stocks tomorrow at market open? (More details inside),"Hi, I'm a high school student currently competing against others in my school using Investopedia's stock simulator. Our competition runs from Jan to Feb end. 


Basically, I felt that oil was going to stay low or drop lower for the next while (I'm almost certainly sure of it), so this Monday (not the best timing, I know) I invested my $100k in a couple of the biggest gold stocks, and 2 stocks that goes short on oil (DWTI &amp; SCO). You can see my portfolio here: https://i.imgur.com/sxGNCOV.png

I had a $2k profit on Monday, but then Tuesday and Wednesday I was down about $6k (didn't sell) as people pulled out of the market from slow growth reports and fear of possible new ECB QE (that's what I thought anyway, correct me if I'm wrong). Recently, when crude goes down most of the market goes down except for gold and silver, which goes up. However, for the last two days gold went down as well because I think people were scared of another ECB QE and just pulled out of the market.

If that's the case, does that mean I should sell all my stocks tomorrow morning and take whatever profit that I can ($3.5k currently), and then re-buy them at a lower price after another quick market tumble? I say this because I've been reading about how the Swiss broke off their commitment to maintain the value of their currency today, *probably* because they think the ECB is going to unleash another round of QE and it's going to be too expensive for them. This would cause another panic in the stock market and repeat what had happened on Tuesday and Wednesday, right? My stocks dropped a lot lower than my purchase price on those two days.

15-01-16,"Buying Call Option to Fund 2015 &amp; 2016 IRA","I am going to fund my IRA to the maximum amount every year forward. I split my contributions between traditional and ROTH up to the the deductible portion of the tIRA as I am squarely in the 25% bracket and therefore do not have the ability to contribute 100% to either at the beginning of the year. Additionally, I value the liquidity highly.

I was thinking, I could purchase 3 ATM S&amp;P 500 Call-Options for March 16 (about the time I would fund my 2015 IRA), Jan 17 (to fund my 2016 IRA). I would hold these in a taxable brokerage account up to about the time of expiration. At or near expiration, I would sell and use the proceeds to fund my IRA and subsequently purchase VTI in my IRA.

My thought is that I will have exposure to the market, at my current AA, at a value equal to my IRA as I accumulate the funds to purchase shares April XX in my IRA. If the price falls below the strike, I will loose the premium I paid. However, as this is a cash-settled equity index, I will receive favorable tax treatment (1256 contract) and I get to purchase the shares at their new lower price. OTOH, if the price rises between today and when I fund my IRA in 2016 and beyond, I can purchase at today's price less the premium paid.

I believe the market is extremely efficient and I am not trying to outsmart it. What I am attempting to accomplish is to increase my TIME IN THE MARKET while I accumulate the funds to fund my IRA in future years.

Ultimately the transaction would look like the following:

The March 2016 S&amp;P mini option with a 200 strike price is priced for 10 shares @ 5.8. I would purchase 3 call options which has a notional value of about $6000 (3x10x$200). The price I pay today to purchase 30 shares of the SPY in March 2016 would be ~$174.

The Jan 2017 S&amp;P mini option with a 200 strike price is priced for 10 shares @ 19.93. I would purchase 3 call options which has a notional value of about $6000 (3x10x$200). The price I pay today to purchase 30 shares of the SPY in March 2016 would be ~$598.

The total premium paid would be $772.

I am looking at this as basically making a contract with myself to fund my IRA at todays prices, in 2016 &amp; 2017.

What am I missing?

Some quick stats:

Emergency funds: Yes Debt: None Tax Filing Status: Single, Tax Rate: 25% Federal, 5.75% State State of Residence: VA Age: 27 Asset allocation: 95% stocks / 5% bonds Max 401(k) + 8.5% match Max IRA Max HSA

My question is, is buying Vanguard ETFs on Merrill Edge the same thing as buying them from Vanguard itself? Aside from the $7 fee to buy the ETF, does Merrill Edge charge any additional middle-man fees? I'd rather keep money within BOFA-MerrillEdge for ease of use and privileges from having a higher balance.

Also Merrill Edge is reporting the Expense Ratios as a number and not a percent so that's a bit confusing. The Vanguard ETFs on Merrill Edge are listed as 0.090 expense ratio. I'm used to % so this confuses me. What does 0.090 ER equal to in percents? Am I paying the expense ratio to Merrill Edge each year?

I'm looking at these for flexible long-term investment or just short-term holdings as an alternative to cash.

Here's what I have to start with:

* $5000 initial investment.

* $700-$1000 monthly contributions.

* $36,000 net salary.

* 401K through company offers 3x match up to $500 per contribution.

* Have a Roth IRA ($0 balance) through OptionsXpress.

* Have a brokerage account through Fidelity ($10 balance).

* No kids. No student loans.

Naturally, I'm looking to maximize. If I can save .25 cents consistently by switching to another type of account/some other service/etc etc, then I will do it. I don't think my company is going to offer me any raises any time soon, so I need to maximize on what I can contribute over the next 5 years or so. 

I'm not afraid of trying out high-yield funds or indexes like Vanguard offers, but I'm such a noob that I have no idea what to look for in an investment. 

I'm young, so I can recover but I would prefer not to have to think in those terms. I'm looking for respectable growth with a bit risk mixed in to sweeten the pot. 

What, if you were me, would your portfolio look like? Should I create my own mix of investments or lump it all into a fund that YOU ALL agree nets a respectable return.

15-01-16,Advice on making my first major investment decisions,"First things first, noob questions spoiler alert.

A little background. 18M UK. After turning 18, my parents made my child savings accounts over to me. I have about £18k total in a variety of forms, savings accounts, premium bonds etc. 

Note, I do not take this for granted; I understand I am extremely lucky to have this and felt abit undeserving. My family aren't wealthy and much of this was inheritance. 

I would like to invest this money rather than let it sit dormant making negligible interest. Also, I understand the importance of 'starting early' and reaping compound interest.

 I have researched a few different investment strategies, such as pound cost averaging, traditional stock 'picking', index tracker funds, certificates of deposit and straight (relatively) high interest savings accounts. Ideally, I am looking for medium return and low risk with minimal maintenance (will be a full time student). Making huge returns is less important to me than security at this stage.

Another aside, I am hoping to study Economics and Finance at university next year, with a career view of something in finance or investment. When applying to jobs down the line, a past/present portfolio demonstrates experience in the field and can differentiate between candidates. However, I admit I have a poor knowledge of investing currently so this would be an option with more risk. 

I really appreciate any advice!

TL;DR - 18M UK with £18k to invest. Looking for medium return/low risk and low supervision. Security more important than return at this stage.

I'm very much new to investing, please bear with me. I have an old 401k through an employer I no longer work for. That is basically inactive. I haven't added anything to it in probably 2 years. It's only sitting at about $6,000 right now (I know that's probably spare change for some on this sub) and I don't know what steps I should take to get it earning money for me again. My current employer offers 401k but in researching theirs it seems like rolling this one over into a new one is going to be a pain in the ass. Partly because the old one has been inactive for so long and partly because the 3 or 4 times I've attempted to talk to my hr about it they have pointed me to generic online resources which don't help me very much. I can't really afford to pay a financial advisor at this time so I'm looking for advice on what the best options I have would be to get this making money again. I definitely don't want to withdraw it. My goal is to avoid having it be taxed. The only idea I have right now is to roll it into an IRA.

15-01-17,"Help me decide where to go next? Diversify, or add to current positions?","Hey, all.  I was hoping to get some advice from fellow investors about where I should try and focus my capital over the next year.

I've got a portfolio that I've been working on since graduating from college.  I've got no debt, so most of my spare income is free to devote to investing.  I don't have a high-paying job, though, so the most I can typically invest is $1500/month.

Here's what my current portfolio looks like, in order of when I started buying shares:

JNJ      160     $14,565
WMB    217     $9114
KO       100     $4253
CVX     69       $7253
WFM    50       $2573
DEO     62       $7134
T         200     $6760

As you can see, I'm primarily interested in large, relatively stable companies and dividends.  Also, I want to hold things for long timeframes; I am looking to own and acquire shares of a company for several years, 5+ is what I'd most prefer.

WFM was just dipping my toe into what I think might still be an interesting growth stock, but I may be getting bored with it and consider just redistributing the money into something else.

Have also been considering slowly getting out of KO.

My most recent acquisition, a whole bunch of T, is now feeling on much shakier ground.  Last year saw some significant shifts in both the wireless and wired telecom markets, and I'm just not feeling like its an industry I want to be messing around in--am considering redistributing this cash into something else.

So based on what I've got going on, what would you add?  

Should I spend a few months or perhaps the year adding to my current positions, maybe get some more CVX and DEO, or try and diversify a little more, while drawing down from KO or getting rid of WFM?  

In terms of potentially trying to diversify a bit more, the companies in my crosshairs for the past couple of years have been SBUX, WFC, NKE, WM, although as you can see I have still not pulled the trigger on any of these.  

I have been gravitating towards SBUX lately and will watch its upcoming reports closely--it has raised its dividend by an appreciable amount each year since it began paying it, and I could see the company becoming a strong dividend growth stock over the next 10-15 years, a la McDonalds.  Obviously if I went with NKE, it would be more in the interest of growth than a fantastic dividend.  But the brand itself is just so strong, and it continues to do well financially.

Have wanted some exposure to the financial sector, and almost bought a bunch of MS in 2012 but didn't go through with it.  Now that financial stocks are back up, I'm feeling more drawn towards a larger-cap, more conventional bank, case-in-point, WFC.  

I am heavy JNJ, but would rather just add to positions to even things out/decrese JNJ's overall percentage of my portfolio than sell any shares.

15-01-17,Is investing in stocks/shares/bonds the most common way to become as wealthy as the top 1 percent?,"Hi all,

I've read that many people from the upper class invested heavily into stocks, shares and bonds which helps them secure and build their wealth profoundly. This was done before the economic depression thus increasing the gap between rich and poor. Is investing this way the most common way to become wealthy? Is it the best option for people from the ""middle"" class to enact in order to catch up to the top tier of wealth in society?

15-01-18,Help calculating a tangency portfolio,"**Story:** I was [recently reminded](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2s6vjt/rinvesting_what_is_the_most_interesting_story_you/cnn585h) that when I took Prof. Robert Shiller's Financial Markets course on Coursera ([it's free](https://www.coursera.org/course/financialmarkets)) I was quite surprised that he presented personal portfolio management as somewhat of a 'solved problem', saying that the [tangency portfolio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory) maximizes expected returns divided by risk (represented by standard deviation as you'll never account for every risk in the real world). So of course I set out to calculate one for the current situation, and failed previously. Fortunately I found an excel add-on that will calculate one for you [here (careful, the macro will only let you open and run it once)](https://sites.google.com/site/portfoliooptimizationsoftware/).

**Data:** I grabbed data for the following ETFs that I can trade commission free, that I felt would give a representative sample of assets with as little correlation as possible:

BND	Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund ETF Shares	- Intermediate-Term Bond	- 0.08% ER  
TIP	iShares TIPS Bond ETF	- Inflation-Protected Bond 	- 0.20% ER  
VNQ	Vanguard REIT Index Fund ETF Shares	- Real Estate 	- 0.10% ER  
VEU	Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Index Fund ETF Shares	- Foreign Large Blend	- 0.15% ER  
IVV	iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF	- Large Blend 	- 0.07% ER  
VB	Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund ETF Shares	- Small Blend 	- 0.09% ER  
 - I wanted to include DBC here for commodities, but I don't want a 0.85% Expense Ratio in my portfolio

**Problem:** BND and VEU only go back to 2007. I believe that since federal interest rates have been kept so low during this period, that my tangency portfolio will over-value bonds. It doesn't have an example of rising interest rates to show the kind of risk that BND carries, especially right now when the fed has said that they'll raise rates in the next few years. Others don't go back much farther. I switched to iShares AGG instead of BND to get back to 2003, but I'd still like much more data. Can I somehow get the historical prices for the underlying indexes, or even theoretical prices before they existed?

**My tangency portfolio: http://i.imgur.com/Ctyivoe.jpg**  

I used *monthly* data. The left axis is expected return, higher is better; the bottom axis is standard deviation, our approximation of risk in the portfolio. We want to maximize return while minimizing risk. Markowitz' efficient frontier (blue line) calculates the absolute highest (and lowest) return for a given risk level given all possible combination of assets we've plugged in. The red triangle is the minimum variance portfolio of about 95% bonds, 5% S&amp;P500 (going all bonds is *not* the lowest risk you can acquire duo to diversification of risk). The green X is the tangency portfolio, where a line intersecting the risk-free-rate (we're using US T-Bills held to maturity) hits the efficient frontier. I marked some interesting data points to show their underlying portfolio.

Please help me improve this calculation of the tangency portfolio, and I apologize if I butchered my interpretation of it anywhere.",3

It seems that CD rates follow treasury rates with some time lag. (source: http://www.bankaholic.com/highest-cd-rates-roundup-for-aug-23-2013/)

At Ally bank you can currently get a 5-year CD at 2.0% where the early withdrawal fee is only 5-months interest.

It seems to me that since 5-year treasury rates have collapsed from 1.72% to 1.22% in less than a month that 5-year CD rates are bound to fall, and probably soon.

So given that and the fact that even 10-year treasury rates have fallen to 1.83% 5-year CDs look incredibly attractive compared to bonds right now.

15-01-18,Latest version Binary Matrix Pro Review ! My personal experience with analysis ! Updated 1-18-15,"Binary Options programs are red-hot right now. I’m almost persuaded to just tell you to go read “Upgrade review of Binary Matrix Pro”, and let you come to your own deductions. However, on the fresh chance that you believe “Perchance its dissimilar this time, maybe this one is a REAL product,” I’ve decided to do a proper analytic review after all.

**What Are Binary Trading Programs?**

A Binary Trade is where you make a bet on which way a particular stock or currency will move over a small time period. If you consider the price will increase, you bet a “call” and if you think it will decrease you bet a “put”. If you were right and the price moved in the correct direction, you win! Binary Options programs always privilege to contain a secret software that will automate this process for you, and will have a ridiculously high winning ratio. You’ll be making thousands an hour. Of course, all this expensive automated revolutionary software is being given to you for free. That’s nice. The product Binary Matrix Pro claims that it will give you “signals” for when to place a trade. In other words, it monitors the markets, and when the time is right to make a profit, it will tell you which market to bet on, and whether to bet on the price rising or falling. Rather than pretending to be an automated software, it claims to be giving you signals instead. This is a bit gentler to you, because it seems more realistic and believable than the other crappy products. 

**Binary Matrix Pro analytic full review:**

I've now read throughout some of the Binary Matrix Pro reviews and feel somewhat judicious for getting complicated with BMP.

So far my experience with the software Binary Matrix Pro is probably not a “scam”. The most important reasons to trust this SSP is that:


**Reason #1: Trading Account Verification (PROOF)** 

I have more pointed out that a verification site would be a good sign and expressing my desires to see the binary options industry become more reliable as whole. Their trading account is verified by BinaryVerify.com, an independent, licensed third party company whose mission is to verify the existence of trading accounts for ssp’s and other service providers. Which ensures every account is real, and all reporting is real here. This is an extraordinary step that guarantees all of their profit claims are real, and not inflated or hyped-up. Probably no ""scam"" here.

S.N: Binaryverify.com – a website that was created in January 2014. Alexa.com clearly shows that the domain was registered the first of past year (1-3-14) with a Scottsdale AZ city/state listing.
The registrant email is: BINARYVERIFY.COM@domainsbyproxy.com.

**Reason #2:  – Several Brokerages Facilities** 

BMP team offers several brokers in a rotation and its determined automatically based on your country’s range of ip. The brokers they placed with are ""Banc de Binary"" a EU trusted broker, “GOptions.com” , “unitedoptions.com”, “beeoptions.com”  and “lbinary.com”  which actually received a good passing grade from its clients and is licensed as well.
EU Regulated and Licensed! Now why is it important? The reason why you should favor a regulated brand over a nonregulated brand is because if worst case scenario you will encounter issues with the broker you can file a complaint with CySEC or ic3.gov but if you go with 90% of the brokers who are not regulated you actually have no protection!
Of course you are encouraged to sign up and make a deposit. But this is just a ""deposit"" and you can get it back anytime. That is technically correct. It is just a deposit and you can get it back anytime you want, however from my experience I know binary brokers usually make you jump through hoops to get your deposit money back. **[So Protect your money and signup with a fully EU regulated broker!](http://edwardhudson.tumblr.com/post/108343895972/upgrade-review-of-binary-matrix-pro-with-my)** 

**Reason #3: Social Performance Reporting:**

Traders share their performance through a social media reporting feature. This greatly legitimizes this product, in my view, because people are instantly sharing their real-time success or failures. If the product didn't work, people would report it. But so far, they're reporting huge profits.
I've been so impressed with the social signals they provide which gives the experience a ""community"" feel. The reporting panel allows the user to:
1.	View the REAL-TIME trade confirmations and outcomes reported by other members of the community, and 
2.	Share their own trade outcomes (profitable or not) with the rest of the community
This is how the panels appear within the Binary Matrix Pro software:

Monitoring panel: this is the first panel users see - it’s where signals are displayed and where users report trading the signal. 
 

* 	 Signal is issued: PUT or CALL
* 	 Current number of users online
* 	 Users who reported taking the signal
* 	 Button for reporting that you traded the signal

Reporting panel: after reporting trading the signal, users are taken to the Social Reporting Panel:
 

* 	 When their trade ends, users can report the outcome (optional)
* 	 How many users reported taking the trade
* 	 How many users reported their trade outcome
* 	 The overall community results of that signal
Note: Even if they decide against reporting, users are eventually taken to the Social Performance Reporting panel, but without the ability to report the outcome as they didn’t report taking a trade.

**Reason #4: $300 Signals Bonus, Pre-Loaded!**

On a daily basis the service will generate up to 750 signals, seriously, 750. In order to “guarantee” that you will have the same results you will only need to trade 40-45 signals per day, about an hour of trading. On the surface the service is free. They provide you with a $300 credit and then charge you $0.01 per signal you receive. At 40 signals per day, 5 days per week that equals more than a year of trading. Enough time to make enough to retire, right? After the initial credit runs out you can purchase more signals in lots of $5 and $10 as needed. This seems pretty reasonable on its own. The only way, and I mean the only way, to ensure that you get the same results as they do is to take EVERY signal. If you only take a few, or only trade for an hour, there is no guarantee that you won’t get all the losing trades.


**Just What Is the Binary Matrix Pro?**

The Binary Matrix Pro is a marketing scheme. They sure don’t tell you very much about the signal service, how the signals are generated, who the software designers are or anything else about them. They tell you lots about how they make at least 8 wins of every 10 trades, impressive. They tell you how you can average at least $106 per day trading only $5 at a time. They also want you to know that you won’t have losing days, some will be higher and some will be lower but all will be winners because you will average an 80% winning percentage. Now trust your own instincts and give a chance to Binary matrix pro satisfy you.

I learn best by experience, and I'm willing to risk losing some money in order to learn the game.

I read most of the recommended finance books that are often mentioned in this sub, and I've been lurking here for just about a year. I think it's time for me to finally dive into the market.

I`m currently only playing the S&amp;P 500 aswell as the xetra DAX.
Am long DAX aswell as long XIV (short vol), and playing the DAX intraday, which has worked quite well for me as of late.

However, since I´m still rather new to the trading game, I´m getting pretty anxious about being short vol. Up until now, I saw XIV as a safe bet if you buy it on dips (i.e spikes in volatility) but I´m essentially selling crisis insurance at this point ... In order for XIV to be liquidated, the VIX will have to rise 160% in a single day, which will leave you with 20% of your initial investment for that day. This has, to my knowledge, never happened before...

I´m currently playing with the idea of basically going tripple long the S&amp;P500 whenever vol is low, and hedging this overexposure with calls on the vix (buying crisis insurance instead of stupidly selling it) rolling them over each month.

Has anybody ever tried something of this sort? If yes, do want feedback!

15-01-18,What are good stocks to invest in ?,"A stock refers to a share of someone’s business. The idea of investing in stocks often brings out a lot of fear and insecurities among people.

Most traders ignore the necessity of mastering the game of money before taking on stocks. Ideally, the performance of stocks is influenced by economic, social and political variables.

There are great opportunities available today that allow investors to buy some good stock for short and long term gains. So, what are good stocks to invest in given the rollercoaster economy?

Useful and interesting to compare 2009/2008 and 2011 to now.  Usually someone is selling such data for 150 bucks a month, figured I would share since I found a free link.

Using 2008/2009 as a comparison, the highest spread I saw from current to 12 months out with random clicking during the height of the oil price decline and resulting contango then was about 17 dollars.  The highest month to month spread I saw was about 4 dollars.  Current month to month spread on brent crude is about 1.40 and on wti crude about 40 cents.

15-01-19,Total Return Estate Planning,"I'm in an intriguing situation. I have been asked by my family to come up with a long term investment plan for their estate. It's somewhere around $15,000,000 now and will likely be twice that when passed to me (only child). My parents both consult, have healthy pensions, and retirement savings so they will still be accumulating in their golden years relative to their consumption. The +60% of the assets are concentrated in a single security, which we are working to diversify opportunistically. There is ~$2,500,000 in accrued tax liability so it is not like we can just shed the position and by VTO.

Because of my job I do have access to Private Equity, Venture Capital, and Hedge Fund investments that others may not. I also have visibility into their returns.

Anyway, the concern isn't necessarily coming up with a portfolio allocation for the estate, rather how are we going to ensure the longevity of this capital to benefit my children, and their children, and so forth. What is the appropriate trust structure? What are the primary risks that need to be mitigated for multi-generational trust? Most importantly, how can I ensure this capital helps my family live comfortable, successful lives for generations to come?

15-01-18,This sounds way too good... Am I wrong? [Brazil],"There is an investment in Brazil called ""Tesouro Direto"", which would translate to ""direct treasure"". Basically, one can loan money for the government for a guaranteed 6% return per year, PLUS inflation rate for that period. For the lack of risks, this seems like a very good investment plan for retirement. The administrative taxes are very low, some agencies ask for 0% in this type. The bad side, the liquidity is weekly, not daily.

What should I be careful about? Is the rate of return low? I think it offers a great return, specially considering that the stock market in Brazil doesn't offer great returns like vanguard's total market,  afaik. I am beginning at investing, any help or tips is greatly appreciated.  Thank you in advance.

15-01-19,Finally was able to try some VitaminFizz,"I invested in $MINE around March and have held and bought during its entire decent. When I heard about VitaminFizz on an investor call, I got pretty excited since health foods was a market I was interested in!  I decided to hold despite the stock crashing down even lower every day.  

Well, after months of months of holding on to the stock, I was finally able to buy a couple of bottles of VitaminFizz at a Walgreen's the other day for $0.99/each! The bottle says it has 100% daily amount of vitamin C and D.  Sparkling Ice and the Kmart version of that have 10%.  

I was kind of nervous to try it since I saw some old VitaminFizz review videos on YouTube back during it's original launch before Minerco owned it.  The guy in the video said it tasted ""vitaminy"" and like Flintstone vitamins, but seemed to like it or at least gave it an ok rating.

I tried the orange mango flavor first and loved it! Really tasty and didn't taste like vitamins at all. It was lightly sweet and had a good fruity flavor and smell to it. I think it tasted more like orange than mango, but there was definitely hints of mango in the drink.  It had a slight fake sugar taste like how Diet Coke has, but it was really faint compared to Diet Coke. The carbonation made it really refreshing after it was chilled.  There was a good amount of fizz to make the drink fun, but less carbonation than in soda so you won't have major burp attacks.  When my bf came home from work, we tried the strawberry watermelon flavor together and that was really good too!  I'm tempted to mix VitaminFizz with vodka or add slices of fruit to it. 

Pros: 
- 100% daily supply of vitamin C and D
- Tastes great, lightly sweet, fruity. No vitamin taste.
- Really cool flavor combos.  They have a pineapple coconut flavor (zomg!), but the Walgreen's I went to didn't have it in stock.
- Great price point.  How can you say no to a product that's $0.99?

Cons:
- Used sugar alcohols, but very little.
- Still limited distribution.  Announcement only said Walgreens and Kmart.  I think some 7-11 have it too?
- Only 6 flavors for now.  No grapefruit unfortunately. :/

Overall, I'm just super excited.  I've been invested in a stock that makes a product I have never tried until NOW.  It was like I was invested in this stock all on theory and now I actually had proof of what they made and was able to taste it..AND it tasted way better than I anticipated!!  Of course, there is way more to investments than just the look and taste of a product, but this was just important to me.  Also, I'm not a hardcore stock investor or anything. This is more a product review than any real stock DD so please take it as such.  Other stocks I'm invested in are all things that I have tried and liked (ie. Starbucks, Target, RiteAid, etc).  Mods, please let me know if this should be posted somewhere else.",4

 definition
Why We Love Passive Income
Why do we love passive income?? Passive Income has to be one of the greatest things ever in life. Something that we can all create to aid our balance sheets, but that few really take advantage of!
 
The passive income series was created to look at ways to earn cash on the side – how to invest some time and effort in return for a reliable and regular stream of income – with very little ongoing effort required. If you missed the first post, check it out below:
Method 1 – Get Paid to Browse the Internet
   Passive Income Series – Method 2: Income from Investing
Income from Investing
Investing is a very broad term and may well be revisited in future posts in the series. This passive income topic will look at three main areas:
Investing in Stocks
Investing in Bonds
Investing Offshore
Investing in Stocks
Stock Market investing strategies vary wildly: from investing to make high-risk gains, to investing in lower risk stocks with high dividends. A lot of people forget that stocks can offer attractive dividend yields in addition to making them money upon selling. Consider the following FTSE 100 companies performance predictions from 2012:
 2222
Impressive predictions right? Obviously, the dividend yield is largely determined by the financial results throughout the year; however some of the top performing companies are fairly ‘safe’ investment choices. Insurance groups account for a large share in the top ranking predictions and are typically quite stable investments.
Be aware that Dividend Yield is just as important (if not more so) as potential share price growth when investing. At the end of the day, the dividends are what will provide you with passive income streams. Do your research and weigh up the risks of investing in stocks – the above companies beat the return on almost any savings account in 2012!
Investing in Bonds
Bonds are often referred to ‘fixed-rate securities’. Corporations and governments typically use bonds to fund projects and investments. They define an interest rate for the return of your investment and your money is usually tied up for a given length of time. The bond will define the interest rate (also known as the coupon) and when the loaned funds (also known as the principal) are to be returned (the maturity date). The interest rates will depend largely on the duration of the bond and the financial position of the issuer. Typical bonds can range from 90 days to 30+ years and interest rates vary dramatically. Consider the interest rate offered relative to historic trends in the market. Recessions are often cyclic, yet interest rates can be very unpredictable. The longer the term of the bond, (usually) the higher risk the investment. The corporation could go bankrupt, the government in need of a bail-out, or other interest rates could become far more competitive. Do your research and only tie-up money that you know you can do without.
Bonds may be a great opportunity to earn some passive income if you are sitting on a large chunk of money and don’t fancy playing the stock market.
Investing Offshore
We have discussed the benefits of offshore investment before on SavvyScot. In a nutshell, using a simple tax calculator has huge tax advantages for expatriates and those that one day wish to retire to a foreign country. A Qrops pension transfer (Qualifying Recognised Overseas Pension Scheme) allows anyone that is already living abroad (or will be within 6 months) to transfer their pension offshore into a government approved scheme and receive their pension in almost any overseas location. If you are at the stage in life (or will bw shortly) that a pension is part of your passive income, the QROPS offers numerous advantages when living abroad, but most importantly:
Reduced Income Tax Liability – Offshore schemes have zero tax at source and would only be subject to in-country legislation. If you fancy retiring to the Middle East and not paying any tax – this might be a good option!
Avoidance of Inheritance Tax – An offshore pension could prevent you from giving up a huge chunk of your net worth to the tax man.
Passive income streams are endless and can be started at any time. From Pensions to Paper Rounds – the only limit is your imagination! Whatever your passive income strategy, you need to make sure that the money you are making is joining forces with you to help you make even more money!

15-01-18,Two Old Jim Cramer Speeches/Articles I keep to Maintain my Sanity in an Irrational Investment World,"I was inspired by [this recent post on AAPL's short term price prediction](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2st9jj/my_top_pick_for_next_week_aapl_heres_why/) to share two old Jim Cramer articles I keep on my computer for posterity. These articles speak volumes in their own right regarding the follies of being swept up in market euphoria, lack of independent thinking, reliance on analyst opinion, and short term orientation. 

I don't mean to single out the reddit post above--this actually pertains to the TSLA/Bitcoin/3D Printing/etc investors as well. It pertains to many of the posts on this sub. 

So here are two hilarious articles from a former Goldman employee/""famous investor"" who sold several bestsellers on investing, has a TV show on investing, and runs a whole website on investing: 

1) [""The Winners of the New World"" Feb 29, 2000](http://www.thestreet.com/story/891820/1/the-winners-of-the-new-world.html)
The article begins: 
&gt;You want my top 10 stocks for who is going to make it in the New World? You know what? I am going to give them to you. Right here. Right now.

&gt;OK. Here goes. Write them down -- no handouts here!: 724 Solutions (SVNX), Ariba (ARBA), Digital Island (ISLD), Exodus (EXDS), InfoSpace.com (INSP), Inktomi (INKT), Mercury Interactive (MERQ), Sonera (SNRA), VeriSign (VRSN) and Veritas Software (VRTS).

Right off the bat many will be able to predict what would have happened to a portfolio of these 10 companies (hint: not pretty). You can easily look up what happened to most of these. The real juice in this article is what comes later. I recommend reading the entire article for education/entertainment, but here are some money quotes:

&gt;They make the Web faster, cheaper, better and easier to access anywhere, anytime. They allow you to get on the Web securely anywhere in the world. They make the Web economy the only economy that matters. That's all they do.

&gt;We try to own every one of them. Every single one. And if I had my druthers, I wouldn't own any other stocks in the year 2000. Because these are the only ones worth owning right now in this extremely difficult, extremely narrow stock market. They are **the only ones that are going higher consistently in good days and bad**. I love every one of them, just as I loathe the rest of the stock universe.

Continues...

&gt;How did it get to the point where **nothing else matters, most particularly the 90% of the stock market I have studied for the last 20 years?** How did all of that knowledge become totally **irrelevant** and the only stocks that work are the stocks of companies that didn't exist five years ago and came public in the last two or three years?

Continues...

&gt;Just yesterday I found myself wishing I had bought i2 when it lost out to Oracle for the giant business-to-business contract for the Big Three automakers. Others had the same idea because i2, the loser Friday, was up much more Monday than GM and Ford could be this year. i2 can own the world because the company with the access to cheap capital always wins. And the companies with no access have to lose.

Continues...

&gt;How did this bizarro world where nine-tenths of the companies I have followed as a stock picker for the last 20 years are losers and one-tenth are winners? To answer that question, you have to throw out all of the matrices and formulas and texts that existed before the Web. You have to throw them away because they can't make money for you anymore, and that is all that matters. **We don't use price-to-earnings multiples anymore at Cramer Berkowitz. If we talk about price-to-book, we have already gone astray. If we use any of what Graham and Dodd teach us, we wouldn't have a dime under management.**

Continues...

&gt;But what about the Old Economy stocks? Can Merck (MRK) raise the bar? Can Pfizer (PFE)? Can U.S. Steel (X)? Or Phelps Dodge (PD)? Union Pacific (UNP)? No, no, no, no, no and no. So what happens to them? Despite the billions in buybacks and the plethora of strong buys that the Street has put out about these companies, their stocks have no traction. 

Continues...

&gt;How can Bank of America (BAC) compete with Nokia (NOK) as a way to bank? How can Goldman Sachs (GS) compete with Yahoo! (YHOO) as a way to invest? Isn't Nokia, with its wireless machine that goes everywhere a better bank than one that needs branches? Isn't Yahoo!, with its access to all of the information and quotes in the financial world a better place to buy stocks than Goldman?

Continues...

&gt;That's why, despite the 80% increase in the Nasdaq last year, we are looking at another record year now. It is by that process of elimination that I have picked my top 10. And my next 10 and my next 10 after. Only those companies are worth owning.

&gt;James J. Cramer is manager of a hedge fund and co-founder of TheStreet.com. At time of publication, his fund was long 724 Solutions, Ariba, Exodus, Digital Island, InfoSpace, Inktomi, Mercury Interactive, Sonera, VeriSign, Veritas Software, Oracle, TheStreet.com, Vignette, Motorola, Cisco, Intel, Nokia, Goldman Sachs, and Yahoo!, and Cramer was long TheStreet.com. 

Reads like satire, but it ain't...

2) [""Gold Surges to Nominal Euro &amp; Pound Record - Jim Cramer Critiques Warren Buffett On Anti Gold Bias"" July 11, 2011](http://www.businessinsider.com/gold-surges-to-nominal-euro-and-pound-record-jim-cramer-critiques-warren-buffett-on-anti-gold-bias-2011-7#ixzz3PCiEcsKS)

&gt;Jim Cramer Critiques Warren Buffett Over Anti Gold Bias
&gt;Jim Cramer, the host of ""Mad Money"" has critiqued the Sage of Omaha, Warren Buffett, and his anti gold bias. Buffett has said that gold isn't a sound long term investment because the precious metal has no ‘utility’. 

&gt;“No one goes to Warren Buffett and says how have you done versus gold in the last 10 years. That is verboten. You are not allowed to ask him that.”

Someone should ask Cramer about his performance from 2000 to 2011...(lol)

&gt;Cramer said that this “makes it very difficult to make headway with people” about owning gold.

&gt;While Buffett snubs the value of gold, Cramer emphasizes the limited amount of gold bullion available and gold’s rarity (see GoldNomics video), as well as the lack of new gold being mined. Cramer says that there is **far less gold than there is Berkshire Hathaway B shares and that Buffett can just print the shares**.

GoldNomics!

&gt;“I would rather buy the insurance policy of gold than the insurance policy of Geico    … pretty simple.” **(to laughter)**

&gt;“He (Warren Buffett) would does us all  …  he is doing everyone a **disservice** by saying that it’s a beauty contest.”

Yes, Warren Buffett did a disservice to investors by telling them to stay away from gold in 2011 (which is down 20% since then and hugely underperformed the S&amp;P and **Berkshire stock**). If Warren Buffett is doing investors a disservice, exactly what service is Jim Cramer providing to his follower investors???

Bonus to article #1 above: Warren Buffett on sitting out of the tech rally in 1999: [""Mr. Buffett on the Stock Market The most celebrated of investors says stocks can't possibly meet the public's expectations. As for the Internet? He notes how few people got rich from two other transforming industries, auto and aviation."" Nov 22, 1999](http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1999/11/22/269071/index.htm)

So above you have a guy who essentially threw away everything he learned about investing and went All-In at the top of the tech bubble. He did it for short term (1-2 year) outperformance (and yet most people don't even see 1-2 years as short term). You'd almost thing the article was complete **satire** when reading it! And then he did it again with gold 11 years later.

15-01-19,Would It Be Reasonable To Invest In These Companies As A Beginner?,"I've heard Warren Buffett say many times in the past that if you invest in quality businesses, then you will be have positive returns in the long run. Unfortunately, I do not know what a good company truly entails, especially based on balance sheets from the SEC. Would it be safe to invest these companies assuming that Berkshire Hathaway has already come to the conclusion that these are strong businesses that will grow over time? 

Are there any other considerations I should make before picking from the pile?

15-01-18,"Passive investors, do you limit your exposure to certain markets by choosing to follow a capped index?","*Not asking for specific products, just opinions on whether you prefer [*geographical*] capped indices over uncapped ones.*

While choosing mutual funds and/or ETFs, what is your opinion on using [*geographical*] capped indices? Currently, the U.S.'s stock market makes up more than half of the total stock market. By following an entirely passive investment strategy -Say, VT-, it would have been beneficial to track an uncapped index, as the U.S. grew faster than most of the world. However, in case of a bear market you would actually profit by using a country/continent capped index. 

I'm aware that a lot of Redditors are citizens of the U.S., could you please answer this question as if you were a non-U.S. citizen? I would like 'root out' the home country bias. :) ",10
15-01-19,Berkshire Hathaway vs index funds,"I'm curious as to /r/investing's opinion on this - I'm thinking of selling almost all of my shares and moving them into index funds (I already have a lot though my ISA) but now I'm wondering if I'd be better off having something like 80% Vanguard, and 20% BRK?

When you look at the charts it's amazing how they've managed to pretty consistently outperform the S&amp;P500... even more so considering the S&amp;P500 has consistently outperformed the UK stock market too. So it seems like a good option... any thoughts?

15-01-19,Questions about changing brokerage,"If I open a new brokerage account is it possible to transfer only a portion of my holdings without liquidating?

I have been shopping around for a new brokerage.  I would rather make sure the research tools and software will work for my needs before I move everything over to it.  I also don't want to liquidate just for the ability to transfer cash to meet minimum account balance requirements.  Because of that I was thinking that it might be reasonable to open a new account with a small subset of my portfolio for a test drive.  If it turns out that the grass isn't greener on the other side then I still have my old trusty brokerage account open to transfer back to.

15-01-18,Can I please get a little help with my portfolio?,"I was told to post this here bc I would receive more help than in personal finance.

I'm here today because I want to keep the wealth I have built at a young age. I have a Roth IRA and an individual account. I built my wealth by speculating, researching, and picking individual stocks, working a part time job, and I invested early in some MMJ companies before they took off. Also, I lived at home to save extra college money bc my parents said I could keep whatever I don't spend as long as I invest it for my future. Obviously I took them up on this opportunity.

Background: 22 years old, student, working part time for an investment firm. I've been investing since I was 18. $1,000 in checking $7,000 in savings along with my 2 stock accounts. No debt.

Roth IRA:

AAPL - $5,300

BABA - $2,900

GOOG - $5,100

NFLX - $3,400

Individual Account:

STOCKS

HBAN - $1,340

BRK/B - $2,240

DIS - $1,900

F - $1,950

FB - $2,255

GILD - $1,510

TWTR - $1,305

UA - $1,630

ETF'S

VDE - $1,100

VFH - $1,200

VNQ - $880

VTI - $3,120

VXUS - $970

So, Reddit, I was looking at buying 3 more funds. Small cap etf, Biotech etf, and a technology etf but I am finding it hard to pull the trigger on it. The money would come from my savings. IDK if I should sell my GILD and use that to buy the healthcare etf or don't sell gild and still buy the healthcare fund (VHT). I was looking VGT for my tech etf but I already have a few tech stocks. And finally, I don't have a small cap growth etf so I was thinking I should be buying one of those. That would leave me with bonds and emerging markets but I honestly don't see much growth from those considering I'm only 22.

Any advice for a young investor wanting to diversify while still maintaining a relatively high rate of return?

15-01-19,2015 Portfolio advice--increase current positions or diversify?,"Hey, all.  I was hoping to get some advice from fellow investors about where I should try and focus my capital over the next year.

I am currently 27.  I've got a portfolio that I've been working on since graduating from college.  I've got no debt, so most of my spare income is free to devote to investing.  I don't have a high-paying job, though, so the most I can typically invest is $1500/month.

Here's what my current portfolio looks like, in order of when I started buying shares of that company:


*JNJ      160     $14,565    
*WMB    217     $9114    
*KO       100     $4253    
*CVX     69       $7253    
*WFM    50       $2573    
*DEO     62       $7134    
*T         200      $6760    


As you can see, I'm primarily interested in large, relatively stable companies and dividends.  Also, I want to hold things for long timeframes; I am looking to own and acquire shares of a company for several years, 5+ is what I'd most prefer.

WFM was just dipping my toe into what I think might still be an interesting growth stock, but I may be getting bored with it and consider just redistributing the money into something else.

Have also been considering slowly getting out of KO.

My most recent acquisition, a whole bunch of T, is now feeling on much shakier ground.  Last year saw some significant shifts in both the wireless and wired telecom markets, and I'm just not feeling like its an industry I want to be messing around in--am considering redistributing this cash into something else.

So based on what I've got going on, what would you add?  

Should I spend some time adding to my current positions, maybe get some more CVX and DEO, or try and diversify a little more, while drawing down from KO or getting rid of WFM?  

In terms of potentially trying to diversify a bit more, the companies in my crosshairs for the past couple of years have been SBUX, WFC, NKE, WM, although as you can see I have still not pulled the trigger on any of these.  

I have been gravitating towards SBUX lately and will watch its upcoming reports closely--it has raised its dividend by an appreciable amount each year since it began paying it, and I could see the company becoming a strong dividend growth stock over the next 10-15 years, a la McDonalds.  Obviously if I went with NKE, it would be more in the interest of growth than a fantastic dividend, though it doe pay one.  The brand itself is just so strong, and it continues to do well financially.

Have wanted some exposure to the financial sector, and almost bought a bunch of MS in 2012 but didn't go through with it.  Now that financial stocks are back up, I'm feeling more drawn towards a larger-cap, more conventional bank, case-in-point, WFC.  

I am heavy JNJ, but would rather just add to positions to even things out/decrese JNJ's overall percentage of my portfolio than sell any shares.

15-01-19,Just purchased my first call option... still have questions about what I got myself into.,"I was approved for options trading through Schwab recently. After a fair bit of online research, not to be deterred by the classic commentary: ""options are risky, you probably don't know what you are doing and you are going to loose all your money"", I felt the need to get some skin in the game to truly understand how these work.

I purchased the following: 3 lots of SLV 01/20/2017 16.00 C @ $3.00
My plain english understanding (please point out any errors): Including commission, I paid $911.25 for the option, but not requirement, to purchase 300 shares of SLV @ $16/share before the expiration date of 1/20/2017. If not exercised/sold before this date, the option is worthless.

Now for the questions:

-I realize I have the ability to sell my option similar to selling stock, but the process of exercising the option (actually buying the 300 shares) is unclear. Any redditors familiar with trading options through Schwab that could shed some light?

-As I understand it, for this option to be profitable, the ETF must rise above a share price of $19.08 ($16 contract price + $3.07 premium/commission) before the investment is ""in the money"". Is this logic correct? How should I compare this payout vs. selling the option? To clarify my confusion- I could sell my option at a profit today, however I can't exercise the option at a profit.

-Any good internet/book resources that have been helpful for others on the topic?

4. If any of the 4 stocks make gains then let it go up until it starts dipping, then sell and realize the profit.
5. The stocks that profit should amount to a far greater gain than the ones the lose
6. Rinse and repeat day after day

Please tell me why this idea is stupid? Here is what I've come up with so far:

1. Lots of transaction fees. 8 transactions a day x 7 = $56 in transaction fees alone
2. Could require a lot of attention to the stocks that are in the green and figuring out when to sell them could be tough.
3. I have heard that stop loss/limit orders aren't exactly perfect. So perhaps they would not cut a loss as quickly as I would need. Since I would day trade, all stocks would be sold by the end of the day. So I don't have to worry about a stock taking a deep dive in the after hours.

15-01-20,Lecture 1.2: Investment Criteria,"**[Lecture 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1qwuci/lecture_1_types_of_assets_misc_definitions/)**

**Commentary:** *I've been busy / lazy the past year settled into a new job but I get asked almost every day via PM ""When is your next lecture going up?"" and I slowly just realized that it's been over year and that those PMs have turned into ""Are you going to keep doing lectures?"" Well, here it is. This is part of the first lecture getting into some of the basic concepts and definitions. To many, it'll be basic stuff but I'm doing a whole ""class"" so we got to start somewhere. Give me two weeks and I'll post lecture 2! This is where the fun starts and we start doing a little bit of maths!*

**Lecture 1.2: Investment Criteria**

Investment criteria is when an investor selects an investment asset that the investor will make his/her choice on the basis of a number of criteria. Below, we will discuss the eigh investment criteria.

1 **Expected Return** - We defined an investment asset as an asset purchased to increase wealth. The return of an asset is the increase in the wealth, commonly measured as a percentage. **Expected return** is the return that investors expect to receive on the asset purchase. Everything else constant, the higher the expected return, the more desirable the asset is to be purchase. There are two ways to achieve a gain on an asset. The first is through current income, and the second is that increase in the value of the asset, also known as capital appreciation. For common stock, the current income is in the form of stock market dividends, which are usually paid on a quarterly basis but can be paid monthly, semi-annually, yearly or under special circumstances. Not all stocks pay dividends, though. The second source for common stock is the increase in the market price of the stock. For common stock a gain from capital appreciation is usually more important than current income from dividends. For corporate bonds, current income is in the form of the semi-annual interest payments, and the value of the bond may also increase (or decrease). For corporate bonds the current income is by far the most important component of its return, almost always paid semi-annually. Although for some assets current income can be negative for both bonds and stocks, current income can only be positive. The corporation will not ask either stockholders or bondholders to make additional payments to the corporation.

Capital gains can be negative for either bonds or stocks. Stocks will fluctuate in value considerably going up and down, but for stock the general expectation is for an increase in value. For bond, the price will be the face value in maturity. If the bond is bought at a price above the face value, at a premium, of the life of the bond the capital gains will be negative. If the bond is bought at a price below the face value, at a discount, of the life of the bond capital gains will be positive. In both of these cases it is not expected that the price change will be unidirectional. Bonds bought at a premium will likely increase in value sometime before maturity, likewwise, bonds bought at a discount will likely decrease in value sometime before maturity.

2 **Risk** - In popular thought, risk may be seen as the possibility that something undesirable will occur. But, in fance, risk is defined in a very precise manner. Risk is the uncertainty of future cash flows. Risk has to do with uncertainty of the future, but it will be measured using past data, because future data, obviously, is not available. [Compare the graph of the average annual returns](http://i.imgur.com/VC79tIm.png) for Investment A (""Graph A"") versus the graph of average annual returns for Investment B (""Graph B""). 
Which shows more risk, Investment A or Investment B? The answer is.... INVESTMENT B! There is more [""dispersion""](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dispersion.asp) in the distribution of the returns for Investment B. How do you measure dispersion? The variance. The variance is the average squared deviation of individual observations from the average value of the series. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, which is close to the average deviation from the mean. Variance or standard deviation measures the total risk of an investment. No math yet, but keep your eyes peeled. Also, there are other ways of measuring total risk which we will talk about in a future lecture. 

**Putting 1 and 2 together - Risk-Return tradeoff (Not an investment criteria)** - Take investment criteria 1 and 2 and put them together. By far the most important criterions. And for the rest of the lectures our discussion will be most frequently centered around these two criteria. In discussing these criteria, reference is often made to the ""risk-return tradeoff."" The risk-return tradeoff is not a seperate criteria but rather a relationship between the two. The risk-return tradeoff is based on two assumptions that are typically made about investors; they are greedy and chicken. They want to maximize returns but they are also risk averse. Investors DO NOT like risk, they prefer a gaurantee! Because investors are risk averse, when they perceive more risk, they demand higher returns. There is a precise relationship between perceived risk and required return. The higher the percieved risk, the higher the required return.

It is also true that the higher the percieved risk, the higher the expected returns. Investors, as a group, make expected returen equal to required return. How do they do that? When an investor buys an asset, like a stock, the investor should only pay enough for for the asset so that the return the investor expects, the expected returned, is equal to the return that the investors demands to earn, the required return. 

Let's apply these concepts by comparing common stocks and bonds. Which is riskier? Which has more uncertainty about future returns? Bond issuers have a legal obligation to make the promised interest and maturity payments. If these payments are not met, the issuer is in default. A corporation issuing a bond or any bond issuer that does not make its legally required payments can be forced in bankruptcy, as what happened to the City of Detroit. So, except for extreme situation, these payments will be made. A corporation is under no similar obligation to make dividend payments. And the investor does not know what future dividend payments will be. Corporations try to increase dividend payments over time. There is a strong aversion on the part of the coporations to cutting dividends once they have been increased, but again there is no certainty or obligation to maintain or further raise its dividends. Remember, the most important part of the return to common stock is in the form of capital appreciation, or the market price of the stock to increase. Changes in market price for common stock are very uncertain! So investing in common stock is decidedly riskier than investing in bond (generally speaking).

So, this leads to a third type of return, actual return. Actual return is what the return that the investment actually earns. (duh, right?). Is actual return always higher for stocks than for bonds? Casual observation indicates no. The last couple years says it is as stocks have outpaced the return of bonds by a considerable margin. But, BUT in recent years prior (07-08 financial crisis) bonds outpaced the returns to stocks. If returns to stocks were always higher than returns to bonds, stock would not be riskier than bonds (but they are!)

3 **Liquidity** - Investors want their assets to be ""liquid"" so they can turn their investments into cash. When asked, students generally give a better definition of liquidity but one that is generally incomplete. There are two components to the concept of liquidity, not just one as student generally provide with their definition.

The first part of the concept of liquidity is often used by itself in a definition of liquidity. Often, liquidity is defined as how quickly an asset can be turned to cash. It is a necessary but not sufficient condition. A liquid asset can be sold at current market value. Here is why the speed of turning an asset into cash is not a complete definition of liquidity. It generall recognized that real estate is not a liquid asset. You know that real estate is not a liquid asset from casual observation and especially if you have ever tried to sell real estate. Homeowners trying to sell their home will with, or without an agent, set a price which is percieved to be fair or at least possible. Advertisements are placed in various places including highly visible signs in the yard. After a month or so, if the owner is lucky, the home may be sold often at a discount from the initially listed price. Real estate is not liquid! But could it sold quickly? Into cash? The answer is yes! All one would have to do is call an agent and indicate a willingness to sell and it could be sold in just a few hours. But what would you have to do in order to accomplish this? All you need to do is take a substantial discount from that price that you would have set. While real estate can be sold for cash quickly, it's not liquid because real estate does not have the ability to turn the asset into cash quickly without the loss of value.

Investors want liquidity because they want to be able to sell their assets for what it is worth and to get their money quickly. Comm stock is typically very liquid. YOu can sell common stock on the market in a matter of seconds at the current market price. You can sell the stock immedietly for its current market value; you sell the stock without loss from its current value; it's liquid! Notice, this does not mean that you can sell common stock for what you paid for it, though. If an investor bought Apple on September 20, 2012, that investor paid $702.10.  If that investor sold Apple on July 23, 2013, the investor sold Apple for $443.48.  (which was up $25 from the previous day’s close) The investor experienced substantial loss on the investment, but that does not mean that Apple stock is illiquid.  On July 23, 2013 the investor sold Apple quickly for its current market value.

For some stocks, or secuirities, there is no active market. That is, there are a scarce number of buyers and sellers. This is true of many municipal bonds, bonds issued by governments lower than the national government. For these types of securities an investor will have trouble finding a buyer and may have to accept a price much lower than what was paid for the security if it is sold for maturity. In active markets, a bid and an ask price are quoted. The bid price is the price at which a trader is willing to buy the security, and the ask price is a price which a trader is willing to sell the security. The bid price, the ask price. The difference is referred to as the bid-ask spread. The lower the bid-ask spread, the more the liquidity the security. For example, on July 23, 2013, at about 2:00pm Yahoo quoted a bid price of $94.56 and an ask price $94.57 for Exxon (XOM). Listed common stock is a very liquid asset. Perhaps, the most liquid market in the world is for Treasury bills, short-term IOU issued by the national government, where the bid-ask spread is often $.13 for a security with a face value of $10,000.

4 **Ease of Management** - Any investment requires some effort to manage. Obviously, investors prefer assets that are easier to manage. Most financial assets are relatively easy to manage. Active investors expend energy tracking the company in which they are invested to make buy and sell decision, but the effort is optional. An investor can always choose to make the investment through a mtual company, or ETF in which all buy and sell decisions are made by investment professionals.

Real assets on the other hand often take considerable effort to manage. Real estate will require constant attention. Fine art must be maintained in good condition. I, personally, would never want to invest in live cattle! You can make investments in cattle, though, indirectly through financial assets, like a futures contract. 

5 **Initial Investment Size** - All initial investments require some minimum investment amount. The face value of coupon paying corporate bonds is $1,000. Common stock can be purchased for much less but will typicially be bought in rounds of 100 shares, making the initial investment size much more. Commercial paper, a money market instrument issued by large corporations, is issued with a minimum face value of $100,000 but is generally sold in multiples of $1,000,000. You or I won't be buying commercial paper directly, but one could bu a money market fund which invests in commercial paper! But even mutual funds have minimum investment requirements. But because investors face budget constraints, the initial investment size is an important consideration.

6 **Transaction Costs** - Going along with  ""Initial Investment Size,"" transactions refer to the cost for buying and selling investments. Investors want low transaction costs because high transaction costs reduce the return on an investment. In some cases, transaction costs alone can cause a positive return on an investment to become negative. The cost for buying and selling equities in the US has come down tremendously as a result of electronic trade. Currently, an investor can buy a round lot of common stock for $10 or $7 per trade. So the bigger the value of the transation, the smaller the transaction cost, as a percentage of the investment. For real assets the trading costs are much higher. Real estate is generally sold with a transaction cost of 6%. For fine art, the transaction costs are often 30%! The term trading cost is sometimes used to refer to the transaction and liquidity costs.


7 **Complexity** - Complexity deals with the level of difficulty in understanding the cash flows in a particular investment. Most bonds issued by corporations are among the least complex for investment. A certain payment is promised every sixe months and the face amount is promised at maturity. But not all investments are so straight forward. The relatively recent collapse in the financial markets in the 2007-2008 crisis results from a collapse in the mortgage market, and the consequent collapse in collaterized debt obligations (CDOs). CDOs are financial instruments which were backed by mortgage obligations but the payment from these mortgages followed very complex arrangements. Most investors who held these, including financial institutions, had limited understanding of these investment instrumented. Most notably, Bear Sterns went bankrupt because of this debacle. Simply put, investors should not invest in financial instruments that they do not understand.  

8 **Ethics** - Last but not least. Many investors will consider whether a particular investment appears to be ethical. Of course, ethics will vary with the investor but at minimum most investors will shun investments that are illegal. For instance, even though dog fighting might have lucrative returns, since it's illegal, one might choose not to do it at the risk of going to prison (cough) Michael Vick (cough). Although one would hope most people wouldn't do it anyway! Certain mutual funds are known as socially consious funds and shun certain investments related to alcohol, tobacco, and fire arms. I think the best immediete example of this is Activision's Modern Warfare 2 mission [""No Russian""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXBDkevx5lM) in which you carry out a terrorist activity, and massacre hundreds of innocent individuals at a public airport. People were outraged about this and I'm sure there were at least a few people who pulled their investment out of Activision not because they were going to lose money, but that investing in a killing simulator of innocent people just isn't right. After the events in Connecticut and Sandy Elementary, a number of funds that are not designated as socially conscious sold the holdings of firearm producers and video game makers as a result of Adam Lanza using a firearm to commit his heinous acts, and playing lots of violent video games like Call of Duty.

15-01-20,What do you think of my Investment Plan?,"I been reading a lot and has been researching different type of investment plan. I am 24, single, no kids. Condo Owner, paying it off in 10 years. Earning 68k as Sr Software Developer. Absolutely no debt (beside condo, at 3.5% interest). I would like to retire at the age of 50 (if I need to, I can push it to 55). 

1. Max out ROTH IRA, $5.5k per year. Invest everything in VFIAX, Vanguard Admiral Index fund. Why did I choose this? From all the reading, especially, bogleheads, they said Index fund, over 30 years period, generally gains the max return. Expecting to start taking money out at 60.

2. Max out 401k. $17k per year. I am matching my employers contribution but I'm not sure whether to max out 401k. I read somewhere that I am able to start taking money out at the age 55, if I am working for a company. Large cap, middle cap. Target date 2050. Diversify.

3. If #2 is max out 401k, I'd still have few grand left for more investment, I was thinking of opening a personal investment account. Contribute few grand every year. Maybe use it in the future for real estate investment, or just leave it in my account til 50. Probably going Index fund on this as well.

Questions:

1. What do you guys think of this strategy? Am I doing something wrong? Can I improve it?

2. Very very interested in start taking money out of 401k at age 55. Are there any special requirements? Would you have to be working for the company for CERTAIN amount of time to be eligible to start taking money out? If not by 55, can I keep rolling over my 401k to my Roth IRA and investing there? (So I can take out at 60). Would this be smart?

3. Should I not max out 401k? Instead put MORE money on my personal investment account? Since, I can take it out anytime and invest elsewhere/use it. The only reason I'm hesitant is because all the tax I'd have to pay.

4. Any other tips, recommendation, etc. are highly appreciated.

Also, if anyone has any question I can help with, I'd be glad to do so.",2

15-01-20,Bonds and Tax efficiency,"Looking at my investments, I've always read that when saving for retirement to keep a ratio of bonds to stocks depending on your risk level.  Now, I am trying to go for 80/20 stock/bond split.  I have money in taxable and non-taxable accounts as well as savings in an high interest savings account.  I've always heard that bonds should be put into the non-taxable account because of the poor tax efficiency. 

I've read up on this but can't seem to figure out where this comes from.  Are bonds considered tax in efficient due to their dividends and monthly returns that count towards income for that year and hence taxed at your current tax bracket?  Would that mean putting more money from my high interest savings into bonds is a better deal, as saving accounts only get up to 1% return per year while bonds can get up to 4% and both get taxed.  

What are people's thoughts on keeping bonds in taxable accounts to reduce the amount in high interest savings?  I feel like that's safer than 100% stocks in taxable and should be better off than keeping more in high interest savings due to bonds being less risky than stocks overall.  It's something I don't seem suggested too often but seems like a good approach to get more than just online savings and less risky than 100% stocks in taxable accounts.",0

15-01-20,Inflation-linked bonds for long term portfolio? (Portfolio comments welcome),"Hey guys. 

So I am starting my investing ""career"" (if we can call it that, I don't plan to be very active) in the next couple of months and so far I have thinking on a 70%/30% split, with 2 ETFs: [global stocks](https://www.justetf.com/uk/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00B4L5Y983) and euro bonds.

I am having some doubts on whether to choose an ETF that is inflation-linked or not, particularly between these two: [Linked](https://www.justetf.com/uk/etf-profile.html?isin=FR0010174292); [Non-linked](https://www.justetf.com/uk/etf-profile.html?isin=FR0010028860).

Feel free to comment about the portfolio, taking into account what I wrote below about me. If you want to suggest some particular ETF, for simplicity and tax reasons I am looking for EU-based funds that accumulate income, and preferably that physically replicate the index.

A bit about me:

* EU-based (Portugal)
* 24 years old
* Timeframe: 10+ years (aiming for the real long term)
* Starting money: 5k€ + 2k€/year
* Have an emergency fund setup, and no big expenses for now (living with parents).

Thanks to the Swiss National Bank's move that decoupled its currency from the euro and restored the free float of its currency, after a three-year trading cap. Even though stocks rose Friday, for the week, all the major indices closed in the red, leaving them down for the third week in a row.

How bad was the fallout from the Swiss move? When a veteran hedge fund manager like Marko Dimitrijevic decides to close a flagship fund -- Everest Capital's Global Fund -- because of losses sustained after the Swiss currency decision, you know the decoupling was both unexpected and pain-inducing.

Exiting the week, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which measures expectations for swings in the S&amp;P 500, closed the week at 20.95 on Friday, well above its 10-year average of around 20 and its 2014 average of 14.2. As you can imagine,

15-01-21,Why this sub will remain a shitty sub...,"Posting from a throwaway because I speak for more than one person.

Every time I come to this sub and try to post something constructive, I always get downvoted. Whether it be explaining certain concepts, pitching a stock (yes with analysis, not just blindly), talking about how to take on risk, or asking about certain concepts, I always get downvoted. The so called ""unpopular opinion""

This sub is a fucking joke. Everyone here acts like mutual funds, ETF's are god's creation. Ask a stupid question? Get down voted to oblivion. Pitch a stock? ""NO blah blah longer run ETF will outperform."" 

Who subscribes to this sub? A bunch of 50-60 year olds about to retire? Also, the fact that the most upvoted post this week is a comic about a financial advisor and fees speaks volumes about the type of people here.  I'm pretty much done spending my time here. The discussions that happen in r/personalfinance and r/finance are way more friendly. 

tl;dr People down vote opinions they disagree with and that's why this sub will remain shit.

This new subreddit will only thrive if people post quality content. I will work hard to post quality content as well. Sorry, I won't allow people who are beginners to join but come back when you have developed a skill or have gained knowledge in a investing sector. The bar has to be set somewhere. Let's bring on the POSITIVE constructivism with a huge slice of financial expertise with variation. 

Edit 3: Don't forget to PM me your background, that would be helpful. ANY expertise in the area, please list. Portfolio return, education, etc. Consider it a resume. If you intend to lurk, then the new sub is not for you. TO CLARIFY THIS IS NOT SOME SORT OF ELITE CLUB. I'm just not going to allow people who are clueless.

""Why do certain GTATQ shareholders seek an Official Equity Committee?"" **

If you have GTATQ shares you want to do this because 95% of the time Public Shareholders are COMPLETELY WIPED OUT in Chapter 11 restructuring.

Otherwise.. GTATQ shareholders are likely to be wiped out.

As I see it, if they're injecting trillions of Euros into the poor economy, then inflation will have to increase (at least short-term), therefore devaluing the Euro.  Of course, their idea is that the Euro will recover, but that would take some time following QE.

15-01-21,"Google Finance Cash Linked Portfolio - Why does ""Cash"" value change drastically day to day?","I have tracked my portfolio religiously for the past 5 years on Google Finance. About three years ago I realized that Google wasn't really telling me the full picture so I came up with a spreadsheet to track.

It very clearly shows me the money I've invested + fees to invest and shows me what my annualized return on that money is. The big thing it does that I couldn't find elsewhere is that it doesn't count re-invested dividends as new money. However this spreadsheet has gotten too big and I now realize that it has limitations.

Recently I switched back to Google Finance and tried ""Cash-linked"". The plan was any new money I put in would be put in as a transaction at a fake date before I ever bought anything. The same goes for withdrawls, they would be removed at the same fake date.

This avoids the problem of the graph of my portfolio suddenly jumping/dropping in value when I add new cash or withdraw existing cash.

Google Finance seems to be doing everything I need it to except for one thing: There are day to day wild swings in the ""Cash"" section at the bottom of the portfolio even though I have done nothing and received no dividends paid to cash. Today it has gone from $250 to $350.

I tried searching on the internet for this issue but I can't find the right terms that don't get me a junk response from Google that doesn't explain it or some finance news that is entirely unrelated.

I need to figure out why this is happening so I can stop it or at least understand the limitations. Does anyone know?

My leading theory is that previous dividend payouts are actually calculated using today's price instead of the price at the time because when the portfolio is up, my cash goes up an and vise versa. Antoher theory is due to USD/CAD conversion being done at today's rate instead of the rate when the actual action occurred.

Can anyone help or provide a solution that will take my list of transactions, calculate the dividend payments based on my holdings at that time and spit out an annualized return amount for the money I've invested (and not counting my dividends as new money invested but a reinvested return on existing money?

Edit - Should also note that Cash changes everytime I refresh the page. It is showing $349 now, which makes no sense. It is cash, how is the value changing so much?",2

I played around with the numbers on my limit price, &amp; couldn't figure out what the hell I was doing wrong. Everything was either too high or too low for them.

I personally think it is a good stock in the long run but, in the short run not so much. Q4 is historically the best for retailers but, some people think Amazon will lose money because of the general failure of their Fire Phone. My personally opinion is that they will report a loss and the stock price will drop considerably. At that low, I believe, it would be a good time to buy and hold it for an extended period of time.
TL;DR I think Amazon will have poor numbers for Q4 but, do well in the long run.

15-01-21,"Simple but new question about IRA's","Hi guys,

So my apologies if this has been asked before, I've used the search but have not found a question like the one I'm about to ask.

So I am currently a college graduate with zero credit card debt, but have the unfortunate student loans (~$60k) above my head. However, I would like like to make a Roth IRA account with small contributions (as little as $50 a month) just to get my feet wet in the world of investing.

However, in the near future, assuming I enter the profession I want to - medicine/physician, I will probably be making more than the income limit that caps people from contributing to a Roth IRA (my apologies for my attempt at using investing lingo as a noob!).

So I have one question that leads to many others. Assuming I become a physician and make say $150k+ 10 years from now, would it still be wise to open a Roth IRA account now? Since traditional IRA's have no income caps, should I invest in that? Or is it possible to somehow convert a Roth IRA to a Traditional IRA down the road?

Once again, my apologies for asking such newbie questions. Thanks for reading!",2

15-01-21,"Hmmm, decisions decisions","My last big bet on a single stock didn't pan out so well.  I bought GOOG right before the 'big miss' on the last quarter.  Cost basis, a hair above 580.

I sold calls against, of course, that was the whole point, being an earnings month at the time.  I didn't buy back and bail, I have held since.  I have also rolled those covered calls down 8 times since then, and have managed to thusly put 40 dollars of those losses back in hand.  My current covered call is at 510 for Feb 20, so my spread between cost and banked call money assuming a 510 assignment is a net minus 30 and change.

I'm debating my choices coming up on earnings on the 29th.

I could buy back again but I'd have to roll to April to break even with it and raise my strike.  April is the be-all/end-all, I'll have to cash in some to pay last year's taxes in April regardless of the price.  And we're not talking about purely upside here, I am also looking at puts to protect my downside at 500, the market is expecting a lofty improvement from GOOG this quarter, if they miss again I can't just sit for year(s) waiting on it to come back up while missing other opportunity.  I can cover my taxes due without bailing entirely out of GOOG, but that is not preferable if they stumble again, obviously.  I don't want to get into a long wait for them to pop back up with oil opportunity looming on the horizon.

Alternatively I could do nothing, and just wait on the vega to slide after earnings.  Of course that only goes so far if they knock it out of the park and my 510 winds up deep ITM.

With the stock generally trending up in the past two weeks I'm not planning on there being enough time for me to unload the current calls, surely not enough to roll again for enough to cover the cost of puts.

So my choices as I see it...

1) Do nothing (stock owned, 510 calls sold in FEB)

2) Buy puts out of pocket (cost around 6 dollars/share)

3) Roll calls to April to raise the strike by 10 for net zero credit/debit (cost zero, potential 10 dollars more upside)

4) Roll calls to April to raise strike and buy puts out of pocket (cost around 6 dollars/share)

Decisions, decisions....

So I invested into DPSM on the OTC market. It is a company called 3D Pioneer. www.3d-pioneer.com. 

I was originally attracted to them because they had the promise of some new 3D printers and software and figured it would be a good place to get into a small 3d printing company. 

Anyways, it turns out that this company is what people like to call a pump and dump? It is my understanding that this company only existed to rally shares from a low price to high price so people could flip a quick profit and then dump the shares leaving any suckers behind holding the bag (me).

I would think this would be illegal, but it appears that it isn't..

I've lost most of my money in this company now, and I'm not sure what to do. The stock is still around but they haven't had a news release for several months. 

Is there still a chance that this company might be legit and rebound? Should I just try and sell my shares for whatever I can get for them and forget about it?

&gt;Proponents of the unicorn boom posit that this time—no, seriously!—is different. Many of the billion-dollar startups, they argue, have the actual customers and revenue that companies of the dotcom days lacked. But no one in the VC world is so sanguine as to suggest that, sooner or later, we won’t experience a market pullback.

15-01-22,Thoughts on MSFT announcements yesterday. Bullish? Bearish? Neutral?,"I am curious what people thought about the Windows 10 and other announcements made by MSFT yesterday.

I think you can break MSFT strategy into two categories.   Defense, protect their desktop and Office market share.   Protect margins.   

Then there is offense which involves capturing market share on devices that are not desktop and also increase market share with their services like Bing.

If you look at the devices where I believe Microsoft needs to gain some traction.   They include:

1)  Smart Phone  
2)  Tablets

3)  TV

4)  Cars

5)  Wearables

Right now Microsoft does not have traction in any of them.   Apple and Google own all of them.  

IMO, Microsoft has to gain traction and become relevant beyond desktop.   Every day that passes it seems like they are further and further away.

I am curious to get thoughts if they felt the Windows 10 announcement yesterday was more defense or offense?   How effective do you think Windows 10 will be in gaining traction beyond desktop?",13

So basically, I have a year before I graduate and my income from school (GI Bill) disappears.  I'd like to put my money (about $5k with another few thousand added about August) in an account that could earn SOMETHING that accounts for inflation and hopefully doesn't lose value within the year.   

My friend has been working in investments for about a year or so and said I don't have a lot of good options with these goals in mind and the timeframe.  He recommended putting about half of it in some undervalued, dividend paying stocks (such as Apple or Exon Mobile)and the rest in an E-trade account to sit so I can't easily access it to avoid spending it.  It'll disappear in my saving account.

that would make the new O/S about 48.5 million shares. yowzaa.  

distro deal is in the bag, but we don't have a name(s) for it yet, but lots of hints towards costco (where batter blaster was sold.)  

i'm personally hoping the buyback happens before the juicy distro PR. i want that float as low as possible when the momo train comes rollin' through.  

a very optimistic step in $NHMD's goal to uplist.  


**on the TA side of things**  

* recently broke and held above the T-line (8EMA)
* head and shoulders pattern (neckline at .11)  
* 50 SMA is resistance.  

imo, ticker is looking to break out again. maybe not the best time to buy ATM, but just a heads up! i'm thinking some very profitable plays are in our near future. keep your eyes open.  

i am long on $NHMD  

edit: if you're wondering when the optimal time to buy is, look for a breakout on high volume and ride the momo. don't hold too long. take profit. etc etc etc  

**edit 2:** looks like we got that volume today. though, on news of the construction of a new production facility in a partnership with http://www.abcolabs.com/, not distribution. plus, it got hyped in a stock letter today... soo.. flippers will be present. it's nice what a little bit of attention can do to a stock with a low float.  

not sure what the play is now. got the mid day pull back now.. i'm hoping .12 will hold. hope somebody else was able to profit off today's morning run.

15-01-21,Where To Find Stocks With Growing Dividends $MMM $XOM $PG $UGI $ARLP $GLP,"Where To Find Stocks With Growing Dividends

The best-known collection of stocks that keep increasing dividend payments is the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats.

This is where you’ll find blue chip dividend stocks like 3M $MMM), Exxon Mobil $XOM and Procter &amp; Gamble $PG … stocks that have given investors annual dividend increases for at least 25 years in a row.

There are two other things a stock needs to be an Aristocrat… a market cap of at least $3 billion and average daily trading volume of $5 million.

Those are some serious hurdles, aren’t they?

This is why the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats get so much attention.

But what about the stocks that grow dividend payments that don’t have heavy trading volumes, and aren’t huge companies with big market caps?

Here’s where to go find them.

Here are four great places to find stocks with growing dividends, and each one of them flies under the radar compared to the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. 

The Dividend Champions – These are like junior versions of the Aristocrats. The Dividend Champions have raised dividends for the past 25 years, but they don’t have to be an S&amp;P 500 stock. And there are no liquidity requirements.

The Dividend Achievers – These stocks have increased dividends for the past 10 years, and the liquidity requirements aren’t tough. Daily trading needs to be above the $500,000 mark.

The Dividend Contenders - Just like the Achievers, these stocks have raised dividends every year between 10 and 24 years. Unlike the Achievers, there are no liquidity restrictions… the stock does not need $500,000 worth of trading every day.

The Dividend Challengers - These stocks have raised their dividends between 5 and 9 years in a row.

Now that you know where to find stocks that have a history of raising their dividends every year, here’s how to get the breakthrough you need for your portfolio.

It’s all about balance. It’s a simple lineup of different kinds of dividend stocks that offset strengths and weaknesses.


UGI Corp (UGI)

Dividend Yield: 2.38%
Annual Payout: $0.87
Payout Ratio: 46%
P/E: 19.24
Alliance Resource Partners (ARLP)

Dividend Yield: 6.30%
Annual Payout: $2.55
Payout Ratio: 53.5%

I have been maxing my SIMPLE IRA and Roth IRA for a couple years now. I have all of my funds in the Freedom Fund 2050(FFFHX). I have been doing some research and am seeing a lot of bad things. I really like the idea of having a hands off, single fund until I know more and have a lot to lose (I am 26, and have ~35k in these accounts). I came across the Freedom Index Fund 2050 (FIPFX) and Four-in-One Index fund (FFNOX).

15-01-22,World’s Most Reluctant Stimulus Program Gets Underway: ECB to begin buying bonds worth 60 billion euros per month,"&gt; As for the question of whether or not it will “work”, the answer is that it will not “work” on the economy, although it will probably have an impact on the markets. This would be in-line with the US QE experience and the Japanese QE experience. In reality, only time works on the cycle. But assets can be juiced and bubbled with QE, almost at will. The problem is that the transmission mechanism whereby gains from an asset bubble translate into actual gains for the economy is far from ideal and is barely effective.

15-01-22,"David vs. Goliath; How MOKO Can Compete with the Big Boys?","Nowadays social media is more than an Internet platform, it has become a way of life. A way for people to connect with others globally, and a way to stay up to date on all current events happening in the world. When one thinks social media the first thing to come to mind are the big platforms such as Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR). Both companies are also publicly traded on the NASDAQ and the NYSE. The Information Technology Sector is up 5.20% over 3 months and 10.29% YTD, 76 companies are rated as outperforming needless to say the Information Technology sector is bullish and in my opinion I don’t think it’s slowing down anytime soon…
As traders we are always looking for the next big thing, scanning and researching different companies through fundamental and technical analysis but the risk is greater when talking about small cap companies. While searching for the next Facebook I came across a company called MOKO Social Media LTD (MOKO). It is currently trading on the NASDAQ at $4.95 with a Market Cap under $80Mill. This might seem like a high priced stock when in comparison to it’s market cap but this undervalued, and relatively undiscovered company is looking to give the Goliath’s like FB and TWTR a run for their money through product variation, and making each social media platform designed for what the consumer desires, For example;
1) REC*IT is Moko's platform for intramural sports and fitness, whose centralized resources are the ACISF and IMLeagues. Information such as team schedules, rosters, and standings already exist. The colleges interface with Moko to provide that content. Students can communicate with each other. According to MOKO, REC*IT has 140,000 unique monthly users since launching in September.
2) Speakisy- A mobile application for college students in the US that will combine features and functionality similar to platforms like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook and will only be accessible with a university-specific .edu email address.
3) BlueNationReview (BNR)- A platform for interests in progressive politics. BNR has roughly 3.2 million monthly visitors.
4) Voycit- is a similar platform, which launches shortly. Voycit acts as a centralized source for those issues. Political campaigns that can't attract attention to an issue through other platforms can use Voycit.
5.) Runhaven and RaceAdvizor- for running enthusiasts interested in aggregated running news, training information, and diet.
6.) Tagroom- A headlining viral video and “news of the day” aggregator.  Tagroom has about 500,000 users. Advertisers include Red Bull, Corona Extra, Bulleit Bourbon and Canon.
Co-Founder and CEO Ian Rodwell states, ""Bespoke for any given community we target. We customize a social media platform for a specific audience. It is more directly suited to that particular audience than any other platform.""
The risk with trading small cap companies is high but if successful the reward is even greater. For those who are content with investing in long-term positions and hoping for 5-10% gains this company is not for you. MOKO is for an investor looking to multiply their investment; those looking for a homerun and MOKO have that potential to be that David Vs. Goliath story in our opinion.

15-01-22,First Time Homebuyer: Looking for negotiation strategy for unlisted home (investor owned).,"I posted this in r/realestate and didn't get any replies. Hopefully the experts here have some insight.

My wife and I have been house hunting for several months now. We are represented by our friend who is a realtor and have signed a buyer/agent agreement through April. While out house hunting with our realtor, we came upon a house undergoing a rehab/restoration that was pretty close to completion. We approached the construction crew and they allowed us to do a walkthrough of the home. We fell in love with the house and the neighborhood immediately. We've seen several homes since this visit and were even close to making some offers but kept coming back to this property as the ideal home for us.

I did some digging on my own accord and through various tax records/google sleuthing I found the developers contact info. I reached out and we spoke at length about the property and he wants to sit down with me and my wife to discuss making an offer prior to the house coming to market. We have a good rapport and he is a very reasonable businessman. 

Now here's the rub: If the house goes to market it will be listed above our budget and I think it will sell close to list. I know that there is some value for a developer in a quick sale without a listing agent(ie: no commission/fees, no interest on loan, etc.) but I'd like to hear from the investor side on anything I might be missing.

With these facts in mind, I was wondering if anyone had any tips for a negotiation strategy with the developer? I know we are really close number wise but what other benefits can I offer to bring his potential profit from going to market down (ie: freeing up his capitol investment immediately, etc.)?

I've listed the numbers below for reference:


* Orig Buy Price (Prior to renovation): $165K
* Developer Investment: ~$140K (Estimation)
* Proposed Listing: $450K
* Our Budget: $400K (with a little wiggle)

Costs I'm aware of:

* Selling/Buying agent fees: ~7.5% ($30K) --I negotiated down to 2% with my realtor and will eat that cost.
* Interest on construction loan ~4.6% ($530/month)
* Utilities ($100/month)


Untangibles:

* Releasing capitol investment 
* Avoid hassle

15-01-22,ETF Linear combinations,"The idea is to increase your Sharpe ratio by choosing some combination of ETFs and percentages that limits risks in down markets while preserving upside in rising markets. Then you can leverage the ETFs using options.

The simplest is 40% TMF and 60% SPXL. This doesn't deal with sectors and because none of these ETFs pay dividends, they are perfect for options (dividends will really screw  with your math if you buy ITM options). Since 2009, rebalanced quarterly, this has a 5-year sharpe of around 2 and 40-50% CAGR

  a backtesting of TQQQ and TMF http://greyenlightenment.com/?p=1540

Presently long 6 deep in the money SPXL and 3 TMFs. The effective equity (assuming a delta close to 1) on this position is $75k and I hope to make $35k by the end of the year.  These are leaps, allowing me to reap the benefits of leveraged ETF compounding. 

Another option is to go long healthcare (CURE, XLV etc) and some TMF. You get a slightly better sharpe, but you open yourself to sector risk",1

15-01-22,CYNAF (Penny stock),"CYNAF, or Cynapsus Theraputics, is a small Canadian company that is currently in the end-stage of trials for an oral version of the Parkinson's drug apomorphine.   

Decent article from July of last year here:
http://seekingalpha.com/article/2308875-cynapsus-oral-parkinsons-candidate-is-undervalued

Since this time, a couple of developments:

1.  At least two studies were completed, both very successful, and a third is underway.

2. The board/principles were given a decent amount of stock right after it was announced the second trial went really well.   

Stock is up from where I bought at $.57 to $1.10 today.   This is my first penny stock so I am unsure as to whether this increase is normal or an outlier.   The head researcher at the company has lots of experience with this drug and the president has sold drug companies before (acquired by a larger company).  I think they are positioned well for a skyrocket to $1.50-$2/share later in the year.   It's also possible they get outpaced by another company working on this (there was an inhaled version that made the news recently) and the stock tanks.   But they seem to be uniquely positioned with their ""Listerine strip"" delivery method.   I don't there is much chance the trials just fail.

I would read that article on SeekingAlpha before denouncing it.  It's pretty well researched.   Right now I have around .05% of my investing assets in it.   I'm a big believer in staying safe with Index ETFs but you have to make these risky plays sometimes with ""small"" money.

Everything is messed up.  You see that little dip back in 2013.  That was when rates were supposed to go up and didn't.  I didn't think they were going up so I bought.  Do you see any dips right now?  I sure don't.  I think rates are going up this time but the bond fund sure doesn't think so.  That bond fund is tracking about as high as it EVER has.

Pigs get slaughtered.  I'm out at 11.44.  To much risk for not much gain in my opinion to hold in the short term.  SEC yield is a shitty 2.5% at that price.

My long term IRA's and 401ks I'm just leaving alone.  Added some BCD's in the Roth.  They are the only thing I feel like has a decent value at the moment.  Time to keep paying on the house.

I fully expect to get downvoted but that is why I have moved out of both bonds and stocks.  Taking the crappy guaranteed 3.8% and going home.  Few more months I'll make the last payment on my house.

15-01-22,Gaming Dividend Payout on Index-Tracker Mutual Fund (ELI5),"Typically, mutual funds have some dividend payout yearly or quarterly.  This dividend/capital gains payout is reflected in the NAV/share price when this happens.

However, I noticed that in December, FUSVX, Fidelity's Spartan 500 (S&amp;P 500 tracker) paid out dividends and capital gains without a change in the NAV/share price.

How is this possible?  What is preventing me from jumping all into this fund the day before dividend shareholders are recorded and jumping all out after the payout is received.

Typically, dividend payout is reflected in share price or NAV.  I don't understand how the index trackers avoid this issue.",0

15-01-22,Cashing in on oil for my Retirement Portfolio,"Hi All,  I am 25 years old and have a ROTH IRA with Vanguard.  I am in The Total Stock Market Index as well as Target Retirement 2055 Index fund.  I was thinking of taking a percentage of my portfolio and investing it in VDE to cash in on oil's collapse.  Since I am fairly young and am invested in moderate risk funds and will be buying the ETF at a good price, I was thinking of investing 10-20% of my portfolio in VDE, and returning those funds into the Target Retirement 2055 fund when oil reaches a high a few years down the road (hopefully). Looking for comments on this approach and what percentage everyone thinks I should invest in VDE.  Thanks!",0
15-01-22,How to invest in Oculus Rift beyond Facebook (FB),"There are a couple of subreddits on this topic, but nothing that's recent. I think that the Oculus will be very popular, even if it's just within a niche market. I think investing in the companies behind the product could produce a big return. Trying to find out the best way to invest in the rise of the Oculus Rift.

Facebook (FB) is an obvious option, but Facebook has several other aspects of their business in which the Oculus won't determine overall growth of the company. I was looking for something that is more of a pure play. 

I have been looking at Spectra7 (SEV.V), Cypress Semiconductors (CY), Invensense (INVN), STMicroelectronics (STM), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Toshiba Corporation (TOSBF), based on the teardown of the most recent Oculus Rift prototype.

With rumors that the consumer version could release as early as this fall, I think now could be the time to start getting into the market. Thoughts?",0

15-01-23,Best Books for Investors - long read,"Every couple of days there's a new post about books for investors. One of the better columnist over at the WSJ - Jason Zweig - put out the following list before Thanksgiving and I thought it would be helpful for those looking for some reading material. There are a couple books you'll recognize, but also many underrated titles. 

**Gary Belsky and Thomas Gilovich, [Why Smart People Make Big Money Mistakes and How to Correct Them](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439163367?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=1439163367&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=stockpucker-20)**

In clear, simple prose, Belsky and Gilovich explain some of the most common quirks that cause people to make foolish financial decisions. If you read this book, you should be able to recognize most of them in yourself and have a fighting chance of counteracting some of them. Otherwise, you will end up learning about your cognitive shortcomings the hard way: at the Wall Street campus of the School of Hard Knocks.

**Peter L. Bernstein, [Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471295639?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0471295639&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=stockpucker-20)**

The late polymath Peter Bernstein poured a long lifetime of erudition and insight into this intellectual history of risk, luck, probability and the problems of trying to forecast what the future holds. Combining a stupendous depth of research with some of the most elegant prose ever written about finance, Bernstein chronicles the halting human march toward a better understanding of risk—and reminds us that, after centuries of progress, we still have a long way to go.

**John C. Bogle, [Common Sense on Mutual Funds](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470138130?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0470138130&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=stockpucker-20)**

The founder of the Vanguard Group and father of the index-fund industry methodically sorts fact from fiction. Following his logical arguments can benefit you even if you never invest in a mutual fund, since Bogle touches on just about every crucial aspect of investing, including taxes, trading costs, diversification, performance measurement and the power of patience.

**Elroy Dimson, [Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton, Triumph of the Optimists](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691091943?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0691091943&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=stockpucker-20)**

Neither light reading nor cheap (it’s hard to find online for less than about $75), this book is the most thoughtful and objective analysis of the long-term returns on stocks, bonds, cash and inflation available anywhere, purged of the pom-pom waving and statistical biases that contaminate other books on the subject. The sober conclusion here: Stocks are likely, although not certain, to be the highest-performing asset over the long run. But if you overpay at the top of a bull market, your future returns on stocks will probably be poor.

**Richard Feynman, [Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393316041?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0393316041&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=stockpucker-20) or [What Do You Care What Other People Think?](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393320928?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0393320928&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=stockpucker-20)**

These captivating oral histories of the great Nobel Prize-winning physicist ostensibly have nothing to do with investing. In my view, however, the three qualities an investor needs above all others are independence, skepticism and emotional self-control. Reading Feynman’s recollections of his career of intellectual discovery, you’ll see how hard he worked at honing his skepticism and learning to think for himself. You’ll also be inspired to try emulating him in your own way.

**Benjamin Graham, [The Intelligent Investor](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060555661?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0060555661&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=stockpucker-20)**

Originally published in 1949, called by Warren Buffett “by far the best book on investing ever written,” this handbook covers far more than just how to determine how much a company’s stock is worth. Graham discusses how to allocate your capital across stocks and bonds, how to analyze mutual funds, how to take inflation into account, how to think wisely about risk and, especially, how to understand yourself as an investor. After all, as Graham wrote, “the investor’s chief problem—and even his worst enemy—is likely to be himself.” (Disclosure: I edited the 2003 revised edition and receive a royalty on its sales.) Advanced readers can move on to Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, Security Analysis, the much longer masterpiece upon which The Intelligent Investor is based.

**Darrell Huff, [How to Lie with Statistics](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393310728?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0393310728&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=stockpucker-20)**

This puckish riff on how math can be manipulated is only 142 pages; most people could read it on a train ride or two, or in an afternoon at the beach. As light as the book is, however, it is nevertheless profound. In one short take after another, Huff picks apart the ways in which marketers use statistics, charts, graphics and other ways of presenting numbers to baffle and trick the public. The chapter “How to Talk Back to a Statistic” is a brilliant step-by-step guide to figuring out how someone is trying to deceive you with data.

**Daniel Kahneman, [Thinking, Fast and Slow](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374533555?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0374533555&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=stockpucker-20)**

Successful investing isn’t about outsmarting the next guy, but rather about minimizing your own stupidity. Psychologist Daniel Kahneman, who shared the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2oo2, probably understands how the human mind works better than anyone else alive. This book can make you think more deeply about how you think than you ever thought possible. As Kahneman would be the first to say, that can’t inoculate you completely against your own flaws. But it can’t hurt, and it might well help. (Disclosure: I helped Kahneman research, write and edit the book, although I don’t earn any royalties from it.)

**Charles P. Kindleberger, [Manias, Panics, and Crashes](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0230365353?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0230365353&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=stockpucker-20)**

In this classic, first published in 1978, the late financial economist Charles Kindleberger looks back at the South Sea Bubble, Ponzi schemes, banking crises and other mass disturbances of purportedly efficient markets. He explores the common features of market disruptions as they build and burst. If you remember nothing from the book other than Kindleberger’s quip, “There is nothing so disturbing to one’s well-being and judgment as to see a friend get rich,” you are ahead of the game.

**Roger Lowenstein, [Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812979273?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0812979273&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=stockpucker-20)**

This book remains the most comprehensive and illuminating study of Warren Buffett’s investing and analytical methods, covering his career in remarkable detail up until the mid-1990s. If you read it in conjunction with Alice Schroeder’s The Snowball, you will have a fuller grasp on what makes the world’s greatest investor tick.

**Burton G. Malkiel, [A Random Walk Down Wall Street](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393246116?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0393246116&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=stockpucker-20)**

In this encyclopedic and lively book, Malkiel, a finance professor at Princeton University, bases his judgments on rigorous and objective analysis of long-term data. The first edition, published in 1973, is widely credited with helping foster the adoption of index funds. The latest edition casts a skeptical eye on technical analysis, “smart beta” and other market fashions.

**Bertrand Russell, [Sceptical Essays or The Scientific Outlook](Sceptical Essays or The Scientific Outlook)**

Russell is Buffett’s favorite philosopher, and these short essay collections show why. Russell wrote beautifully and thought with crystalline clarity. Immersing yourself in his ideas will sharpen your own skepticism. My favorite passage: “When a man tells you that he knows the exact truth about anything, you are safe in inferring that he is an inexact man…. It is an odd fact that subjective certainty is inversely proportional to objective certainty. The less reason a man has to suppose himself in the right, the more vehemently he asserts that there is no doubt whatever that he is exactly right.” Think about that the next time a financial adviser begins a sentence with the words “Studies have proven that….”

**Alice Schroeder, [The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553384619?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0553384619&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=stockpucker-20)**

With unprecedented access to Buffett, Schroeder crafted a sensitive, personal and insightful profile, focusing even more on him as a person than as an investor—and detailing the remarkable sacrifices he made along the way. If you read it alongside Lowenstein’s Buffett, you will have an even deeper understanding of the master.

**Fred Schwed, [Where Are the Customers’ Yachts?](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471770892?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0471770892&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=stockpucker-20)**

First published in 1940, this is the funniest book ever written about investing—and one of the wisest. Schwed, a veteran of Wall Street who survived the Crash of 1929, knew exactly how the markets worked back then. Nothing has changed. Turning to any page at random, you will find gleefully sarcastic observations that ring at least as true today as they did three-quarters of a century ago. My favorite: “At the end of the day [fund managers] take all the money and throw it up in the air. Everything that sticks to the ceiling belongs to the clients.”

**“Adam Smith,"" [The Money Game](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0394721039?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0394721039&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=stockpucker-20)**

In the late 1960s, the stock market was dominated by fast-talking, fast-trading young whizzes. The former money manager George J.W. Goodman, who wrote under the pen name “Adam Smith,” christened them “gunslingers.” In this marvelously entertaining book, Goodman skewers the pretensions, guesswork and sheer hogwash of professional money management. Reading his mockery can help sharpen your own skepticism toward the next great new investing idea—which almost certainly will turn out to be neither great nor new.

What opinion do you guys hold on VWAHX - Vanguard High Yield Tax Exempt Bond Fund. 
It provides a good tax free dividend each month and primarily invests in Municipal Bonds.   
Can it be used as an alternative to keeping money in the the bank. I understand that there can be around 10-20% fluctuations in the value. Even during the recession, it lost about 20% of its value for about 6 months while continuing to give dividends.   

So if the money is not needed for 5 years (as an example) is this a good way to park that money.

1.  I would give him a few thousand dollars of my own money to put into his Charles Schwab account.
2.  He would day-trade as usual.
3.  At any point I could decide to withdraw the money.  I would get back the original (or as much of it that still exists) plus 90% of the returns.
4.  We'll put all of this in contract.

We both live in the United States.  So is this legal?  Neither of us have any involvement or licenses in professional finance.  How would we handle taxes?

1.  Would he be taxed on the gains and could then give me my share as a gift?  Or would we both have to pay tax on the gains, effectively paying it twice?  Presumably I would have to give him 10% + the amount he is taxed for my portion.
2.  Or would we each report taxes on our own gains?

15-01-23,"Anyone else a little skeptical of Netflix's ""strong"" earnings?","So I'm sure most people know by now, but Netflix stock jumped over 40% on Wednesday following their Q4 earnings announcement (now trading at about $430 per share).  I was taking a look at their financials and I wasn't too impressed with the growth rates in revenue and operating income (both were less than historic growth rates).  Obviously, analysts were impressed since the stock price jumped so high, but after taking a closer look I noticed  the reason their Net Income figure was so impressive is because in Q4 of this year they had a Tax *Benefit* of about $38 million.  This is a massive shift from their historical effective tax rate of around 35 - 40% over the last two years.  Going by historic tax figures, Netflix earnings would have been about $20 million less.

So essentially what I am saying is I believe analysts are overreacting to an amplification of the firm's earnings due to a number, that has nothing to do with operations, creating a distorted earnings number.  My bold prediction is to watch out for Netflix stock to take a hit following their Q1 earnings announcement, as analysts will move their expectations up but this will not persist as that tax benefit is a one-time number and as is the nature of deferred tax benefits - that number will reverse. 

Interested to hear everyone's thoughts though.",33

Information Statement Pursuant to Section 14C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934

This Definitive Information statement is being filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on January ___, 2015, in connection with the Joint Written Consent of the Board of Directors and the Majority Consenting Stockholders, both dated January 8, 2015, to amend the Company's Certificate of Incorporation (the ""Amendment"") to effect the following corporate actions: (i) to change the name of the Corporation from Zaxis International Inc. to Emerald Medical Applications Corp.; (ii) to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 (the ""Common Stock"") from 100,00,000 shares of Common Stock to 490,000,000 shares of Common Stock; and (iii) to implement a reverse stock split of the Company's Common Stock on the basis of one share for every four (1:4) outstanding shares (the ""Reverse Stock Split""), so that every four outstanding shares of Common Stock before the Reverse Stock Split shall represent one share of Common Stock after the Reverse Stock Split.

Pursuant to Rule 14c-2(b) promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act""), the actions approved by the Joint Written Consent of the Board of Directors and the Majority Consenting Stockholders cannot become effective until twenty (20) days from the date of mailing of the Definitive Information Statement to our stockholders.

The Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation will implement the One for Four (1:4) Reverse Stock Split of our issued and outstanding Common Stock, to be effective upon receipt of approval be FINRA (the ""Effective Date""). New Common Stock certificates will not be issued at the Effective Date, but may be issued subsequently with respect to any certificates returned to the transfer agent upon a sale, exchange, or for any other purpose. No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders who would otherwise be entitled to receive fractional shares because they hold the number of shares of Common Stock that is not evenly divisible by 4 will have the number of shares to which they are entitled rounded up to the nearest whole number of shares. No stockholder will receive cash in lieu of a fractional share. The Company's Common Stock is subject to quotation on the OTCQB Market under the symbol ""ZXSI."" Upon the Effective Date of the Reverse Stock Split, FINRA will change our symbol to reflect the Company's name change in connection with the Amendment.

ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND MAJORITY CONSENTING STOCKHOLDERS

ACTION I

AMENDMENT TO THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO CHANGE THE NAME OF THE CORPORATION TO EMERALD MEDICAL APPLICATIONS CORP.

Effective January 8, 2015, the Corporation's Board of Directors approved an Amendment to the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation to effect the name change from Zaxis International Inc. to Emerald Medical Applications Corp. based upon the Joint Written Consent of the Majority Consenting Stockholders.

A copy of the Joint Written Consent is attached as Exhibit A to this Information Statement and a copy of the Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation is attached as Exhibit B to this Information Statement.

Reasons for the Name Change

The Corporation's Board of Directors ratified, approved and recommended that the Corporation's Majority Consenting Stockholders consent to the Name Change to more accurately reflect the Corporation's recent business developments. More specifically, as disclosed in its current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 2, 2015, the Registrant announced that it had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Emerald Medical Applications Corp., a privately-held Israeli company (the ""MOU"") that contemplates the execution of a definitive agreement and reverse merger.

Emerald is engaged in the business of commercially exploiting its proprietary ""DermaCare"" technology which is used for the early detection of skin cancer using a unique, cloud-based software which Emerald markets to medical professionals for their patients as a service solution and is designed to revolutionize the diagnosis and detection of skin cancer thereby significantly reducing mortality.

The execution of the definitive agreement and the consummation of a reverse merger are subject to certain conditions including the Company's successful raise of $800,000 from third-party investors. The MOU further provides that the terms of the capital raise are subject to agreement between the Company and Emerald and that upon the closing of the reverse merger, the holders of Emerald's capital stock will be issued a number of shares of the Company's common stock equal to 45% of the then issued and outstanding common stock on a fully-diluted basis as at the closing, excluding the Company's securities issued to the investors in the capital raise. Emerald's equity holders will also be entitled to receive up to an additional 21% of the Company's Common Stock then issued and outstanding, in three equal tranches of 7%, subject to Emerald's achievement of certain milestones to be set forth in the definitive agreement.

ACTION II

AMENDMENT TO THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO INCREASE AUTHORIZED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AND AUTHORIZE SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK

The Board of Directors with the Joint Written Consenting of the Corporation's Majority Consenting Stockholders ratified and approved the Amendment to increase the number of our authorized shares of Common Stock from 100,000,000 to 490,000,000 shares of Common Stock. The Amendment will not increase or otherwise change the authorized 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the Preferred Stock, none of which are outstanding. The Common Stock and the Preferred Stock is sometimes referred to, collectively, as the ""Authorized Capital Stock."" The Authorized Capital Stock of the Corporation shall therefore be five hundred million shares (500,000,000 shares), of which four 490,000,000 shares shall be shares of Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares shall be Preferred Stock. The Preferred Stock may be issued in one or more series and the Board of is authorized to fix the powers, preferences, rights, qualifications, limitations or restrictions of the Preferred Stock and any series thereof pursuant to Section 151 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, without further action by the Corporation's stockholders.

A copy of the Joint Written Consent is attached as Exhibit A to this Information Statement and a copy of the Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation is attached as Exhibit B to this Information Statement.

The rights of any additional authorized shares of Common Stock will be identical to those of the currently authorized and outstanding shares of Common Stock. However, because the holders of Common Stock do not have preemptive rights to purchase or subscribe for any new shares of Common Stock upon any subsequent issuance(s), any authorization and subsequent issuance of additional shares of Common Stock, whether in connection with the planned capital raise, the reverse merger, the issuance of earn-out shares or otherwise, will reduce the current stockholders' percentage ownership interest in the total outstanding shares of the Corporation's Common Stock. This Amendment and the creation of additional shares of authorized Common Stock will not alter current stockholders' relative rights and privileges.

The increase in our authorized Common Stock will become effective upon the filing of the Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which is expected to occur as soon as is reasonably practicable on or after the twentieth (20th) day following the mailing of this Information Statement to the Company's stockholders.

Reason for Increase in Authorized Capital

In order to facilitate our ability to raise capital in furtherance of our business plan, as contemplated in the MOU with Emerald, we are expected to issue additional shares of our Common Stock and securities convertible into, or exercisable to purchase, additional shares of Common Stock. After implementation of the Reverse Stock Split on a one-for-four (1:4) basis, we will have 4,548,781 shares of Common Stock outstanding and will have 485,451,218 shares of Common Stock available for issuance for any potential business purposes, including the capital raise, the reverse merger, any subsequent issuance of earn-out shares to Emerald's equity holders as well as be sufficient to accommodate potential future issuance for proper business purposes.

As a result, our Board of Directors and our Majority Consenting Stockholders have determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and all our stockholders to have available additional authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock and therefore need to increase the number of shares of authorized shares of our Common Stock. As a result of the increase in authorized Common Stock, the Company will be able to issue shares from time to time as may be required for proper business purposes, including the planned capital raise, the reverse merger and related transactions as well as raising additional capital for our ongoing operations, establishing strategic relationships with corporate partners, acquiring or investing in complementary businesses or products or providing equity incentives to future employees and management.

Effects of Increase in Authorized Capital Stock

In general, the issuance of any new shares of Common Stock will cause immediate dilution to the Company's existing stockholders. Further, while such future issuances could also theoretically affect the amount of any dividends paid to such stockholders and reduce the share of the proceeds of the Company that they would receive upon liquidation of the Company, the Company's present financial condition would preclude the payment of any cash dividends or permit any distribution of proceeds in the event of any liquidation. Another effect of increasing the Company's authorized Common Stock may be to enable the Board of Directors to render it more difficult to, or discourage an attempt to, obtain control of the Company by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, and thereby protect the continuity of present management. The Board of Directors would, unless prohibited by applicable law, have additional shares of Common Stock available to effect transactions (such as private placements, mergers and acquisitions, among other capital events) in which the number of the Company's outstanding shares would be increased and would thereby dilute the interest of any party attempting to gain control of the Company, even if such party is offering a significant premium over the then prevailing market price of the Common Stock. Such issuances would increase the number of outstanding shares, thereby possibly diluting the interest of a party attempting to obtain control of the Company. The Board of Directors is not aware of any attempt, or contemplated attempt, to acquire control of the Company, and the implementation of this resolution to increase the authorized shares of Common Stock was not presented with the intent that the increase in the Company's authorized Common Stock be utilized as an anti-takeover measure and is not part of any series of anti-takeover measures contained in any instruments or the Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or the Bylaws of the Company in effect on the date of this Information Statement.

The shares of Preferred Stock that are presently authorized may also be issued in one or mare classes or series, having such designations, preferences, privileges and rights as the Board of Directors may determine, without further action by our stockholders.

Nevertheless, the increase in authorized shares of Common Stock and the currently authorized shares of Preferred Stock could make any attempt to gain control of the Company or the Board more difficult or time consuming and that the availability of additional authorized and unissued Authorized Capital Stock might make it more difficult to remove management. Although the Board currently has no intention of doing so, shares of Preferred could be issued by the Board to dilute the percentage of voting rights owned by a significant stockholder and increase the cost of, or the number of, voting shares necessary to acquire control of the Board. Further, while the Board of Directors has no plan to issue any shares of Preferred Stock, it does believe that having available shares of Preferred Stock for issuance in the future in connection with any proper business purpose, together with the increase in authorized Common Stock, will result the a better capital structure to grow our business.

* How old are you?
* Are you employed/making income? How much?
* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)
* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)
* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
* Any big debts?
* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.

15-01-23,ITM Index Option Pricing 1 year out vs Index average annual returns,"Looking at pricing of in the money calls for the SPY for about a year out, namely the Jan 15 2016 200 Calls.

Currently SPY is at $205.73, the Ask price on the contract is $15.84.

This means that the SPY would need to go up by $15.79, or 4.89%, to break even.

The annualized return of the S&amp;P index over the past 25 years is well above 10%.  

So is this just suggesting that we're in an especially low-volatility time? It would seem that if the S&amp;P increased in line with its average, this would be a fairly easy money maker.

15-01-23,Big rule change! All questions asking for advice on your personal situation now belong in the new daily advice thread. Posts asking for individual advice will now be removed.,"Hey everyone,

We've been talking about this change for quite a while, and after some of the recent threads decrying the state of the subreddit, we feel that now is the time to make this change. 


**Details**

Every day at 7:00 AM Eastern time, /u/AutoModerator will post a new ""Daily advice thread"". All questions asking for help or advice about a person's personal situation belong there, not as its own thread in the general queue. 


**Impact (the Vanguard affect)**

We believe that this change will have a major impact. Most importantly, we think it will free us from a lot of the ""Active investing is for suckers, just be an indexer"" rabble. By putting the advice posts in one thread, that clears the rest of the sub up for discussion about actual investments and investment news, and no one should feel the need to espouse the necessity of indexing in threads that don't need it. At the same time, the change still allows for people that need help to get their questions answered. 


**Feedback**

Please let us know what you think of the change, and if there is anything you think should be done differently in its implementation.


**First thread**

If you have $100 in a stock with 1% dividends, then for the stock value to beat the dividend yield, the stock price would have to increase by ≥$1 per quarter.

15-01-23,Am I lucky or is there a grain of skill?,"Hello, I'm 15 and about 3 weeks ago began trading for fun using a practice account on ""trading 212"", a desktop and mobile trading app. 

The practice account began with €10,000 and over the first week I learnt the ropes and lost and earned healthy amounts of money, I was sitting on about €9,800 at the end of the first week but I was confident I could return to 10,000. That night I invested in gold and set it to sell automatically when it reached a lucrative price, not too high, only enough to make back the €10,000 (so €200). 

It did and then over the next week I traded in gold quite well, now investing in lots of thousands vs the sheepish 1-2 hundred. 

By week three I was at 12k and began trading in nsdq and am (currently) sitting on 19,600. 

Am I just lucky? Although I'm not just investing willy-billy because the sky is my lucky shade of blue, I'm in turn not using the complicated maths or spender hours over looking decisions.

15-01-23,Does QE Divergence Hurt QE Outcomes?,"I just had an idea, and I haven't really done research, so I may very well be wrong, but hopefully we can get a fun conversation with it:

Right now monetary policy is starting to diverge in the US and Europe/Japan. While the ECB is upping stimulus, the US is starting to pull out. This will obviously cause rates to drop in Europe/Japan, but rise in the US. Keep in mind the entire point of adding money to an economy is to encourage money to move around more quickly, stimulating economic growth. But as rates increase in the US and fall in places like Europe and Japan, I would suppose that the monies in Europe/Japan would expatriate to places with higher rates (and no higher risk) such as the US. Now the money that was supposed to circulate in struggling economies is leaving the struggling economies until interest rates even out between countries that are stimulating their economy and countries that are not.

Essentially the question is: can some of the more modern monetary policy practices work if the entire world is not united in their monetary policy decisions?

15-01-23,Why does this happen? (options question),"I have been using a strangle strategy the last couple of weeks:
Call SPY 202
Put SPY 201.5
for instance. Prior to this week, the two would be pretty consistent with their movements (Call would rise $20, Put would fall $17 and so on). So, I have been using that to successfully pull a profit (albeit sometimes small). 

This week and the latter part of last week were completely different. I implemented the same strategy but am now seeing a huge skew in price movement (Call would rise $10, Put would fall $30). 

I have no idea why this is happening and it's generally on the down side (meaning the rise in the Call/Put (depending on the movement of the market) would be about 1/3rd the movement of the Call/Put on the downside). 

This has thrown me for a loop, so I made sure that the delta's were relatively neutral (.01) and I still saw a huge skew in the movement today on SPY options (upside $89, downside $125). 

Can someone please explain to me what is going on? Was the conformity in movement previously just an anomaly or does the spread skew more during times such as this of higher volatility (earnings announcement time) and if that is the case, how do I compensate and identify this? 

Implied volatility seems to keep coming up on my searches but I'm still unsure how to gauge this to ensure a more uniform movement in my strangle strategy. ",2

15-01-23,A personal appeal to /u/fscomeau,"*Throwaway account for obvious reason.*

Dear fscomeau,

I have been following you for quite some time. I have read your analysis of The Habit, which I personally did not like. I have read your post on oil, on the upcoming Christmas rally and seasonal effects, on Virgin America and on pretty much everything else. 

I have read your post and analysis on Fibrogen and I have read your article on ""Wall Street explained in 5 minutes,"" both of which I really liked, if nothing else as entertainment.

No matter what everyone says or might say, you are a bright person. There is little doubt in my mind that you are an educated, hard-working and devoted person, with an insane tolerance *and* appetite for risk. I like that a lot. You've managed to find a winner and you deserve all the credit, period. 

That being said, now is the time for you to be brought back to reality. Believe me: I know *exactly* how you are feeling right now. At the time of writing this, you are up 65.61% on your position in just three days, an extraordinary gain by all accounts. Whether this was achieved by luck, talent, or both, you are now feeling like you are absolutely unstoppable. Right now, emotions are clouding your rational mind and the only thing you see is all the money you could make the day after earnings.

I want you to hear this: I have felt *exactly* like you are feeling right now many, many times before in the past. You feel elated, euphoric, name it the way you want, you are feeling *good.* Perhaps you're out celebrating, eating at an expensive restaurant, paying rounds around you and showing off. Perhaps you are counting the dollars you are about to make and thinking about all the awesome new toys you could buy with them. Perhaps you have a screenshot of your options play as a background image on your phone and you are showing it around the table.

But I want you to know this: you are in a very dangerous position that could very well wipe you out in a minute. I know you are aware of that fact, I know others have told you so, but I have to remind you: you could lose everything in a flash. With that in mind, I implore you to sell half your position tomorrow before the market close. Please, please, please do not keep your position open over the week-end; this is possibly the last thing you should do.

If you were to sell half of your position, that is, 50 lots, you would receive $26,250 precisely. Since you invested $31,200 into the trade, your total exposure would go from the $31,200 you invested originally to just $4,950. This means that in the worst scenario in the world, if the worst possible cases materialize, you would end up with a net loss of $4,950, plus what I assume to be commissions.

I know you think ""Apple can't possibly go down."" Tough news, and you really need to hear this, but it can. You have been lucky enough to buy during an uptrend, but there is no guarantee this will continue even a minute longer. 

At a price of $112.40, you only need a 2.13% drop for your calls to lose their intrinsic value and for your calls to be out-of-the-money. For a stock with an elevated volatility such as Apple, a 2.13% drop is nothing. As far as you know, it may drop 3% tomorrow just because of normal daily volatility. In fact, it has dropped 3% or more in a day several times in the past. If that happens, all of your nice investment is gone. And I haven't even mentioned the drop in implied volatility post-earnings which might also get you.

But I haven't touched the real reason you should sell. And please note I am not recommending you to sell everything: just half. Take some profits off the table, please.

*You should sell because the week-end is coming.* Two long days where everything can happen. Trust me: you would have to be insane to want to hold that position open over the week-end. It's just too risky. What if Russia officially declares war to Ukraine? What if the extreme left wins with a huge majority in Greece? What if a bank announces it's insolvent due to the CHF's explosion? A lot of things can happen during those two long days.

Even if you are right on Apple, what if the market opens down 2% due to one of the reasons above? Your position would be wiped out. Period. Again, fscomeau, you do not want to hold that position open during the week-end. It's the absolute definition of risk and you do not want to run such a risk, not in the situation you are in right now.

If you sold half your position, as I said, not only would you sleep more soundly, but you would cap your maximum loss at $4,950. Germany suddenly announces it is leaving the EU? Max loss capped at $4,950. Ebola making a comeback on US soil? Max loss capped. Hedge fund decides to dump its position before the earnings? Max loss capped.

If you followed this risk management strategy, you would still hold a sizeable call position in Apple and stand in a prime position to benefit from the ""stellar earnings"" as you put it. You would still have $26,250 in play, which is still a lot and quite enough to make a tidy profit from the possible positive outcomes of your trade strategy.

One last thing before I go. I hope that if nothing else above convinced you, this might.

As I have said earlier, I have been in your shoes before, many many times. And some people, like I am doing right now, tried their best to convince me to sell *at least* part of my positions at the top to manage my risks. I didn't. I was arrogant, I was cocky, I was convinced nothing could go wrong and that things could go no way but up and, at the end, I ended up losing not only my unrealized gains, but almost my entire capital. Please do not repeat my mistakes, and the mistakes of many, many traders before me. Learn the lesson the easy way: reduce your risk, take some profits and spend the week-end celebrating being a prudent, cautious and smart trader.

I took the time to write all this for one reason: I like you as a person. I think you are entertaining, I think you have some ""guts"" and it is obvious you put a lot of work and effort in what you do. Please, please sell half your position before the week-end. Every single trader you will talk to will repeat that this is probably the last thing in the universe you want to be holding over the week-end.

I have to make a decision on 5,000,000 10 year loan that is linked to the 10 yr treasury. I have till June 1 of 2016 to do so. Every month I wait I save 19,000 in prepayment penalty on the current loan. I am taking out 750k in cash on the new loan, so every month i can wait, I add 19k to the money i take out.  The difference in payment, (if I was to lock right now)  would save me 4,000 a month on the payment (current loan 26k vs new loan 22k).

Speculation of course, but Jollibee does already has a relationship with Dunkin’ ($DNKN). 

It did a deal with Dunkin’ last year to build something like 1,500 Dunkin’s in China. Jollibee has 30 or so Dunkin’s in the U.S. Seems like Dunkin’ is at least on the short list of companies that Jollibee will be looking at. I know there’s rumored to be plenty of growth opportunities for DNKN in the eastern part of the U.S., but unclear on their positioning in China. 

Problem is; Dunkin’ has a near $5bn market cap. Seems like they’d have to work with some other PE partners to get the deal done.

15-01-23,"Is it ""safe"" to pick a stagnating REIT for its higher dividend vs. a slowly growing REIT w/lower dividend?","I'm looking at the following REITs for inclusion in my Roth IRA.

* O (4% annualized dividend yield)
* TWO (10.12%)
* VNQ  (3.6%)
* NYMT (13.75%)
* EARN (13%)

Of the following, TWO and NYMT (mostly the latter) have been in a pretty small range over the past couple years. There's some movement up and down, but not too much and they fall back into a small range.

With O and VNQ, arguably the two big ones in the country and in the sub, I'm seeing movement upwards, but not as much dividend growth. They've both had a good run over the past 52 weeks; their size and credibility would likely explain the smaller dividend yield. VNQ, for instance, easily out-earned the others at 31% over the past year just in share price growth.

Since I'm not necessarily trying to time the market because I'm not Buffet, does it make more sense to pick the option that's just been relatively horizontal (TWO, NYMT) for their dividend plays instead of a more (maybe?) volatile VNQ or O?

NYMT has some bullish recommendations per Fidelity's research tool, and to a lesser extent, TWO. O is more neutral.",1

15-01-23,Three value investing lessons from Graham and Dodd,"Security Analysis by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd is probably the most “mentioned” book when it comes to value investing. First published in 1934, it was used as a required reading textbook in the course by the same name at Columbia Business School (apparently, now only the excellent preface to the 6th edition by Seth Klarman “The timeless wisdom of Graham and Dodd” is compulsory). The immense value of the book is in that it remains relevant, as a framework to think about investments, over 80 years after it was first published.

Having heard all the revered references to this book, I first dived into ‘Security Analysis’ expecting to see a clearly laid out method for deriving that elusive animal called “intrinsic value” of a firm based on taking a magnifying glass to a company’s financial statements. But not quite. While the book does spend time on the key things to look out for on income statements and balance sheets to find what might make a company less or more attractive, it does not go as far as to prescribe a single model view of the world. I was surprised by two things, both due to my own ignorance (less by the 1st and more by the 2nd):

1 Half of the book deals with fixed income securities or bonds and preferred stocks. Common stock investing was termed as “speculation” and heavily “disclaimered” as being not suitable for the majority of retail investors

2 Unlike “experts” in any field who have a pithy explanation for everything under the sun “this is easily explained by…”, the authors of this book frequently say “we don’t know why…” when it comes to discussing instances of share prices diverging from their “intrinsic” values as computed by their conservative methods

They refer to this unpredictability repeatedly to hammer home the need to rely on tangible past performance more than optimistic predictions when approaching equity investing. I think the humility as brought out in the 2nd point above is what makes this book the classic that it is, a philosophy I referred to in my post on humble decision-making.
While the book abounds in insights, here are the top 3 takeaways I found, with select excerpts from the book:

1. Intrinsic Value has nothing to do with market price

&gt;(all text in quotes is directly from the book) “…We must recognize, &gt;however, that intrinsic value is an elusive concept. In general terms &gt;it is understood to be that value which is justified by the facts, e.g. &gt;the assets, earnings, dividends, definite prospects, as distinct, let &gt;us say, from market quotations established by artificial &gt;manipulation or distorted by psychological excesses. But it is a &gt;great mistake to imagine that intrinsic value is as definite and as &gt;determinable as is the market price.” 

There is no spoon. Just because one might put together a complex excel model that factors in every line item on the company’s balance sheet, it’s a mistake to assume that the resulting number is what every market participant should agree to, eventually.

And therefore…

&gt;“…Security analysis does not seek to determine exactly what is the &gt;intrinsic value of a given security. It only needs to establish that the &gt;value is adequate. For such purposes an indefinite and approximate &gt;measure of the intrinsic value may be sufficient. Just like it is &gt;possible to decide by inspection that a woman is old enough to vote &gt;without knowing her age or that a man is heavier than he should be &gt;without knowing his exact weight.”

So while a completely arbitrary guess about the “right” stock price, picked on the basis of numerology, or one determined after careful and conservative assessment of financial performance and industry analysis are both wrong, only one has a better chance of identifying the bargains and the white elephants.

2. Price-Earnings ratios are arbitrary

&gt;“…Security analysts cannot presume to lay down general rules as to &gt;the “proper value” of any given common stock. Practically &gt;speaking, there is no such thing. The bases of value are too shifting &gt;to admit of any formulation that could claim to be even reasonably &gt;accurate. The whole idea of basing the value upon current earnings &gt;seems inherently absurd, since we know that the current earnings &gt;are constantly changing. And whether the multiplier should be ten &gt;or fifteen or thirty would seem at bottom a matter of purely &gt;arbitrary choice.”

This one raises a few eyebrows given Price-to-Earnings is the most frequently discussed valuation metric in financial media. I even did a post on trying to predict future index returns based on current P/E. Another way to think about the above statement is that, at a company level, earnings per share are susceptible to accounting gimmicks and hence shouldn’t be taken as the sole basis for deciding on (un)suitability of a stock.

&gt;“…Hence the prices of common stocks are not carefully thought out &gt;computations but the resultants of a welter of human reactions. The &gt;stock market is a voting machine rather than a weighing machine. &gt;It responds to factual data not directly but only as they affect the &gt;decisions of buyers and sellers.”

Just because a stock has been bid up 75% in three weeks, doesn’t mean it’s worth jumping in.

&gt;“…We would suggest that about 20 times average earnings is as &gt;high a price as can be paid in an investment purchase of a common &gt;stock…

&gt;…we submit a corollary of no small practical importance, that &gt;people who habitually purchase common stocks at more than about &gt;20 times their average earnings are likely to lose considerable &gt;money in the long run. This is the more probably because, in the &gt;absence of such a mechanical check, they are prone to succumb &gt;recurrently to the lure of bull markets, which always find some &gt;specious argument to justify paying extravagant prices for common &gt;stocks.”

You can almost see the shrug of the shoulders with which the authors set that self-confessed arbitrary limit of “20x earnings” as a cut-off. While the cut-off itself is unimportant, the takeaway is that the more one pays for a stock, by some predetermined standard, the more likely that it will lose money.

3. Predicting anything, especially the future, is difficult

&gt;“…In addition to emphasizing strongly the current showing of a &gt;company, the stock market attaches great weight to the indicated &gt;trend of earnings. There is a two-fold danger in the magnification of &gt;the trend; the first being that the supposed trend might prove &gt;deceptive, and the second being that valuations based upon trend &gt;obey no arithmetic rules and therefore may too easily be &gt;exaggerated…

&gt;…Hence instead of taking the maintenance of a favourable trend for &gt;granted, as the stock market is wont to do, the analyst must &gt;approach the matter with caution, seeking to determine the causes &gt;of the superior showing and to weigh the specific elements of &gt;strength in the company’s position against the general obstacles in &gt;the way of continued growth.”

As of this writing, Page Industries shows a stock price of ₹11,609 where each share shows earnings of ₹156. i.e. 74x earnings. Another company, Jubilant Foodworks trades at ₹1,378 while making ₹17 per share i.e. P/E of 81. Both these companies are in high-growth areas with significant scope for future expansion.
But to the value investor, the risk in projecting this high growth rate into the future to arrive at a fair purchase price is all too evident. Hence he focuses on companies with demonstrated performance and has the patience to wait for the “right” price before investing.",5

15-01-23,"[27 Years Old] Going back to college, what major?","I am torn between (in no particular order) Economics, Accounting, and Finance majors.

I want to be a financial analyst/adviser, I love budgeting peoples' money in my free time and helping them prioritize savings and getting them going for retirement.  I figured I might as well get my degree and get paid to do what I am already doing for free!

I know 27 seems ""old"" to be a Freshman, but I have had some MAJOR setbacks in life.  The biggest being a car wreck in which I was the passenger and was pronounced dead at the scene, airlifted and resuscitated, and was in neuro-ICU for 8 days, then bedbound for 8-9 months.  This was shortly after turning 21, and I had to do cognitive and physical therapy for the greater part of 4 years after I learned to walk again using a walker.

Anyways, back to the point.  I want to get my Series 6/7.  I live in a smaller town in Indiana, Fort Wayne, however I am planning on getting my degree, banking up some money, then hauling ass to a warmer state (Arizona is in mind).  So with that, the initial salary isn't THAT important coming out of college, but it is still of course a factor.  

Out of the three, which is more ""investing"" oriented, in terms of passing my Series 6/7?  I am assuming Finance, but the only fear there is I have no clue what jobs I would do in the interim as a Finance major.  With accounting and econ, there are jobs readily available everywhere here.  I'm afraid a Finance degree will have me at a $12/hour cubicle job for some reason, so please someone prove me wrong!

Then, of course, my long term goal is to do the stock market on the side, so analysis is also a plus if either teach it.  I am sure that's just something you mainly pick up from years of the trade, though.

15-01-24,Investing versus Stock Trading,"This article is about the difference between Investors and Traders. 

http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/difference-investing-trading.asp


I use a hybrid strategy - buying stocks that I would hold long term, and trading them over a short term. The idea is that there is no bad entry point for a long term stock. There are only preferred entry points. For this reason, ""any time"" is a good time to enter the market. 


Some people seem to feel that buying stocks is investing. That's not true. Buying stocks that you have researched and evaluated on the fundamentals is investing. Otherwise, you are trading - and in some cases, gambling. So now there are three groups that I am talking about: Investors, Traders, and Gamblers.


One fundamental difference between a gambler and an investor is their approach to growth stocks. An investor understands the fundamentals of the companies that they buy. An investor, at a bare minimum, knows the P/E ratio of the stock and if the stock pays a dividend. A gambler has read the buzz, or ""feels"" that a stock is a ""good investment"". An investor often can tell you the projected growth. He's looked at their net income and free cash flow. A trader has evaluated the technical charts, and understands the momentum of the stock in question. Mutants like myself understand the momentum, technical indicators and the fundamentals. 


In summary, if you bought on the fundamentals, you are an Investor. If you bought on the Technicals, you are a Trader. If you bought on anything else, you are a Gambler. Don't gamble. The stock market is not a casino.

Higher bid possible. If bid is raised, I expect $21.50 to be the final price. Still a steal for the founder, considering real estate + current assets equaling about the buyout price. I suspect founder wants to privatize and re-list in Shanghai or Hong Kong where co will trade at a much larger multiple. Timeframe for an update on the deal is unknown at the time. I expect some update in the next week or two.

I blow money all the time, this is no different. Just another fun outlet and a good learning experience, for me personally. As well as the obvious adrenaline.

I'm just not sure if this formula is right or possible. This is also based entirely on a market where I'm expecting it to go up a fair chunk or down a fair chunk (earnings reports).

Let's say I put $400 down towards an AAPL call for jan30 expiration. That's 10 contracts (1,000 shares, $0.40) for a strike of $122. If it goes up to  $125 I make $2,600 in profit (covering the $400)

Now with that still on the table, let's say I want to insure myself so I do an AAPL put for $102 jan30 at $0.38, so I go ahead and sink $114 (3 contracts) into that. If it goes down to $100 I make $486 in profit, covering the initial $114 i put into that. So in the end it covers the $400 I put in the call options and I also get a little profit from the put options. $86 profit total in the end. Only downside I see is that I lose the $114 if I'm not able to execute my puts, but that is minimal compared to the call profits.

So does this formula mean that, as long as the stock goes up a lot or down a lot it's a viable insurance? And this could be played in reverse if I were to expect a stock to go down? Would my only concern be if the market were to hover? What would this strategy be called if it is something viable.",2

15-01-23,HSS IPO (UK) [X-post /r/UKInvesting],"Heya folks,
With the IPO of tool-hire group HSS on the horizon, I was wondering what your thoughts on it might be? They expect the share price to be between 210p - 262p a share, giving a market cap of £363m at the midpoint. Here's a link to the [information leaflet](http://www.svssecurities.com/Portals/0/Skins/SVS2011/pdf/hsshire_Leaflet.pdf) and [prospectus](http://www.svssecurities.com/Portals/0/Skins/SVS2011/pdf/hsshire_prospectus.pdf).",3
15-01-24,An write up on risk.,"I don't think this is covered enough for the noobs.  

As I have posted before I have decided to remove my taxable investments and put them towards the house.  I understand historically the market has beat 3.8%.  Hell I understand some stocks pay more than 3.8% in dividends.  However, several reasons make this the best choice for me.  There is a good chance the spouse and I might move in a few years.  If rates go up I'll be relocking at whatever the current rate is assuming we don't pay cash outright.  So I might have 5% mortgage.  Or maybe rates will be lower.  They are lower than when I bought almost 3 years ago.  If I still have my rental I'll then have to be screwing with the banks that don't seem to understand we don't live our life like most people and I can in fact pay things off they way I say I can.  I was told several years ago we could only get $528 a month for a house loan if I kept our other house in rental status.  We were putting about 1-1.5k in savings a month after all expenses WITHOUT collecting rental income.  That means I could make both payments easily.  I laughed at the banker when I was given the $528 number but that is what their numbers say.  So when/if we move again I won't be screwing around with buying on contingency if the house is paid.

I have no crystal ball.  

What I do have is knowledge and the fact I watched what happened to my money after I invested for the first time in 1999 in a Roth IRA.  Yeah, that took a long time to recover.  I'd been better taking the 3.8% return.

I'm not comfortable investing in anything with a 5 year time horizon right now.  But again I have no crystal ball so I let the 401k do its thing.  I do believe continued investment over time produces good results.  I also know that mathematically if I was sure I didn't need this money for 30 years I'd be better off lump summing it.

But it is the time frame that I am concerned about.  Stuff can happen in a blink of an eye.  Jobs can be gone.  Bills can pile up.  I could be sued.  I could get sick an not work.

Debt.  I have lots of it.  I have student loans and I still have the other mortgage on the rental.  This debt doesn't bother me.  I can always defer the student loans if I have hardship and if the bank repo's my rental so what.  Opps.  If that happens I'll be up shit creek anyways.

So looking at risk as a whole what do market returns get me?  I might be able to get 5% more by investing and not paying on the house.  However, we must remember if I do move I'm relocking at the new rate.  So if rates go up to whatever and I have to get a loan maybe my 5% is now 3%.  I also will have the issue with bank and getting a new loan if I still have to make payments on the house monthly or screw around buying on contingency.  While I could hold money in my taxable if I start over funding the 401k I'm locking that money up.  I couldn't get it to pay on the 5% loan if rates rise.  I'd have the roths maxed so I could pull the principle on those but then I can't refund them to the level I had them at.

So on the 100k I have left on the house over 30 years it would be a nice return.  However, IF history repeats itself I'll basically only have 7% more by lump suming the money into the market and holding for 30 years and making min payments on the house (assuming we don't move for 30 years) vs. paying off the house and then investing large sums of money monthly.  7% is the number.

So that is if everything goes right.  That is no job loss, no market crash, and no whatever.  Now what if stuff goes wrong?  What if I lose my job?  What if I do get hurt?  What if this happens while the market takes a dive?

That is a situation I don't want to be in.  Couple that with I firmly believe interest rates aren't going to rise that much.  I think the fed is finally going to raise rates but it won't be much.  I think we will be in a near zero inflation period for quite some time.  As such I don't believe any asset class is going extra ordinarily well compared to the past.  I think the market will grind on but I don't think we will see the historic returns of the past.  What is going to drive the growth?  If anything deflation seems to still be a bigger threat.  Now Europe is doing QE.

So what this all boils down to is if things go according to history the game is over for me either way and I win.  If I were to invest essentially using my house as margin I could be faced with finical ruin.  Now admittedly that risk is small.  But if someone told me that today 1-24-15 if you walk outside there is 99.5% change you won't be shot but a 0.5% chance someone will murder you I'd probably just stay in doors for the day.

Everyone should evaluate risk.  Everyone should have goals.  If you go over to wsb you'll see someone put a 30k on apple calls.  The numbers are saying he has reached 66% of max profit anyways from the time frame he made the investment.  IV crush is going to kill him.  Apple is also trending upward.  This makes a further large spike upwards unlikely.  If fact if anything it makes a miss likely to cause a huge drop.  He allegedly is still holding the position.  It's a dumb move any way you play it in my opinion. 

So there is nothing wrong with locking in some gains on the year on both bonds and stocks and going home.  This is what I was trying to post up about when I say I made 10% gains on my bonds and 15% in my taxable.  I hit way over the profit level I expected especially on the bonds.  I was not going to hold through another federal reserve meeting.  I think shit is to high for short term money.  The downside potential is to great for me for the goals I have.  

Have a goal.  Stick with it.  Change it if necessary but make well thought out moves.  People put to much emotion on money.  We'll all be dead in 100 years.  Time is the most valuable thing.  We only have so long to do certain things.  I'd rather insure I'll be able to do mostly what I want in the upcoming 30 to 40 years than make another couple hundred thousand.  It isn't worth the risk to me.

I'm aware that there are different types like day trading, swing trading etc, and I'm looking to figure out what fits my goals and time availability best.

I'm not naive, I know that I'm starting from zero knowledge but I learn fast and I can be disciplined about decisions if I have data and processes to base those decisions on.  I'm willing to put in a lot of time to learn about what this is all about before putting any actual money into it.  I'm envisioning a learning process of months before I get started. 

I'm not new to investing completely.  My grandpa instilled the value of investing in me when I was young, so I have traditional long-term investments (401k etc) that I am very comfortable with sitting back and letting them do their thing over time.

So my main question is, where do I start?  Can anyone recommend some resources to start exploring trading?

15-01-24,Learning about Trading... Few questions about trading education,"Hi everyone,

I am a full time biochemistry/pre-pharmacy student looking to learn how to trade in the stock in order to earn part time income to pay for pharmacy school. I know futures is more profitable and requires less money, but it is too high risk due to leverage. I am trying to learn as much as I can about trading in my spare time. 

But then it finally came upon me: why would anyone teach others how to trade? If I were making thousands of dollars trading in stock market, why would I tell other people? Because then wouldn't my strategy be ruined and I would no longer be making money? An example comes to mind is Nicholas's Darvas's ""How I Made Two Million in the Stock Market"". A lot of his advice related to trade psychology is very relevant. However, I noticed many people today trade as he does. He invested in companies that he believed were the next ""big thing"" and had huge potential. Also note the box method he promotes is also very common which I see as really just noting the support/resistance, then selling at the closest to the top of the breakout (think he said: ""Don't close the opera when there is an audience"").

Another thing I thought of is: If these people are teaching others how to trade, couldn't they at that point just manipulate them so they can be profitted off of? Example: Warren Buffet. A lot of people follow his advice and trades exactly as he wants them to. At that point he can predict their behavior and profit.

Is reading books on trading techniques+strategies actually helpful, or just a scam? Am I overly cynical? Why would anyone teach others helpful trading strategies?

I've been doing ok teaching myself using Think or Swim but its definitely been a slow process and low profit. I would like to take my skills to the next level and become a better trader since my methods have reached its end.",0

So i have been given the opportunity to invest in a Canadian company that is researching and is supposedly in talks with several known companies in regards to the purchase of their product.

I have signed a non disclosure agreement and have spoken with the owner of the company (family friend of a friend) all of this seems very interesting and exciting, however, there is always this question in the back of my mind that it could be a scam (I am naturally suspicions and protective of my money) The guy that I know told me he invested $20k in the company - this reassured me a little, but I would only be investing a few hundred max (what I can afford to lose)

Anyway, I asked if I would be able to speak with their manufacturers or partners to confirm the product and their involvement, however was told that they have also all signed non disclosure agreements due to espionage possibilities.

The website looks pretty amateur, and isn't very convincing, however, the shareholders area looks a little better, still not a lot of wow factor or info on the products other than the name and a very basic description. with some updates as to the production etc. 

The company is registered here in Canada, I cant seem to find anything on them from a google search except for their own website. and the guys linked in profile.

15-01-25,Average return and volatility of asset classes,"Hi

I am looking for some average returns and volatility of different asset classes to help estimate the risk-reward probability of my portfolio. I've been scanning over the internet, but of course every website gives different numbers and usually there is no overview for different asset classes or stock marktets. 

Ideally, I would like to complete the following table:

Asset | Av. return | standard dev.
---|---|----
US stocks | |
europe stocks | |
Japan stocks | |
E.M. stocks | |
Gov. Bonds | |
Corp. Bonds | |
Commodities | |
Cash | |
... | |

Any white paper on this, perhaps?

Thanks!",9

15-01-25,From Old Portfolio to New,"Hi guys,

after years of holding loads of single stocks without a real strategy, I have read up a bit on the subject of investment and thought I'd get some advice from you guys.

[Here is my current situation](http://i.imgur.com/IiJhJoa.png)

[Here's what I plan to do](http://i.imgur.com/JYm2SaE.png)

I am 29, employed and want to invest long-term; don't have any plans with the money except holding it and growing it.

I might be adding around $5,000 each year to the portfolio.

I am rather on the safe side, which is why I am mostly interested in safe investments, but a little volatility doesn't hurt as I don't need to access it but can ride through the waves.

Time horizon is 20+ years, no debts.

What's your guys' opinion on the planned portfolio? Any advice is much appreciated!

EDIT: I should specify that I plan to hold mostly ETFs (basically the entire ""Value"" and ""Growth"" categories will consist of those), but I am happy to hear your suggestions.

15-01-25,My thoughts on the stock market,"I'm fairly new to the stock market, I had some extra $$$ last year and I was lucky enough to get %60 returns.

And I would rather mess up and learn my beginners lesson and lose $5000 at 20 rather then learning it at 50 and losing $200 000.

Anyway... after watching many different types of stocks I've come to a conclusion that the whole market is extremely speculative. Especially reading in this sub you often hear ""If you think this is the bottom of the oil drop, then buy away"". 

Because if one person buys something, that means someone else wants to sell it. They both have access to the same information but have come to different conclusions. The stock price right now reflects all the outside information up until right now so the only thing you really need to worry about is what you think will happen next. 

This is where I think good research comes in. You put yourselves in the CEO's shoes and think what he should do next. Doing this with several companies in the same industry, and looking at who has previous relationships is how I have been choosing. I do this as more of a hobby and don't always invest because I hate the thought of losing too much (The most recent one was Blackberry and Samsung with their partnership announcement, Blackberry has enterprise establishment with less respect, but Samsung has the power and wishes to enter enterprise markets)

Interest rates base rate is at 0.5% which further adds to cost of housing. Furthermore the NHS is being privatised, Royal Mail and much of the UK assets are being sold off to private companies.

15-01-26,Gold as a strategic reserve of Russia. Part 3.,"I should add that if the release of the Bank of Russia Rubles not under foreign currency, and under mined gold in their own country, it would solve several interrelated tasks.
The main ones are:
1) the planned reversal in the direction of the Central Bank of the Russian economy;
2) Support the development of ""currency shop"" of the country;
3) The implementation of monetary emission without creating inflation;
4) protection of Russian economic sanctions;
5) the formation of a strategic reserve, which may be required in case of war.
By the way, we must clearly understand, which requires the accumulation of gold in Russia. Some believe that such accumulation is necessary to strengthen the ruble, and then make it a ""gold standard"". Strengthen the ruble, from my point of view, it is possible and necessary. But no gold backing and the introduction of free convertibility of the ruble in gold, and the development of the real sector of the economy, import substitution, industrialization of the country. On the sad experience of the introduction of gold ruble in Russia (""reform Witte"" in 1897) has repeatedly stated. The then ""innovation"" has driven Russia into a debt loop, as required to support the ruble to maintain the country's gold reserves (gold constantly flows abroad). We had to constantly refer to the world moneylenders for loans to replenish the gold metal reserve of the State Bank of the Russian Empire. The country on the eve of the First World War occupied the 4th or 5th place in many kinds of industries, but the foreign debt was in first place in the world.

Once again, the gold is not necessary for the conduct of monetary policy of the Central Bank (some even offer to carry out the Bank of Russia ""golden intervention""), and to ensure that the country was a strategic reserve. In the 1930s, when the West economic crisis broke out, were eliminated remnants of the gold standard. Money lost contact with the metal. But the country continued to accumulate gold reserves, because everyone understood that soon there will be war. And then it and it alone will be the only ""universal equivalent"" in the world market. USSR also accumulate gold reserves. According to some estimates, in 1941, he had already exceeded 2,000 tons.

By the way, as a strategic reserve of gold it would be wise to keep the balance sheet is not the Central Bank, and the Ministry of Finance. Incidentally, in the United States all their thousands of tons of gold in 1934 are in the treasury. In the USSR, the Ministry of Finance was ruled gold reserves, and the State Bank (and its subordinate Bank for Foreign Trade) only perform certain gold transactions on behalf of the Ministry of Finance. Especially unacceptable accumulation and storage of gold in the institution, which ""independent"" from the state. Namely this status is today the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, concentrated in the hands of almost 100% gold reserve of Russia.

15-01-26,Thoughts about tying asset allocation to market high?,"I haven't been able to find any resources on this idea so figured I'd toss it to you folks to tear apart (or hopefully refer me to some research).

The basic idea is that you set a floor and ceiling for your stock/bond allocation. When stocks are at an all-time high, you are at your bond ceiling and won't suffer much in a crash. When stocks drop off the most recent high, you drop your bond allocation by the same percentage to buy more stocks low.

It's a little different from just maintaining a constant allocation through rebalancing. Let's say you set your floor/ceiling at 80/20 and your stocks are all in VTI. In the last crash you'd have been:

20% stocks/ 80% bonds in october 2007 (stock market high = bond ceiling)

50% stocks/ 50% bonds in march 2009 (50% off the stock high = 50% stock allocation)

And now you'd be back at 20% stocks again (since January 2013, actually).

Without seeing any data I'm guessing this works better as a wealth preservation strategy than a growth strategy. What do you say? And are there any tools out there I could plug some of these numbers into?

15-01-26,Gigafactory to increase cobalt demand.,"Tesla Motors' Gigafactory is going to increase the global cobalt demand. Tesla has also said they want to source their materials as ethically as possible and prefer sources in North America. When it comes to cobalt, this leaves only one company for Tesla to get their cobalt from, Formation Metals (FMETF). Formation Metals has 100% ownership of a cobalt source in Idaho and they have the environmental permits needed to create the mine. They have the first 2 phases of their mine development complete. The third and final phase is currently being reevaluated as the company considers switching to producing battery grade cobalt chemicals. Initial studies have shown producing this has lower costs than the high purity cobalt they were previously going to produce. 

Due to the recent drop in cobalt prices, FMETF is at a great price to buy. The Gigafactory ensures that the long term cobalt demand increases. Also, Elon Musk has mentioned that multiple Gigafactories are needed, but for now, I'm just considering the one Gigafactory being built.

The location of the Gigafactory in Reno, Nevada also favors cobalt from Idaho (less shipping cost).

Most of the other cobalt in the world comes from the Congo were it is extracted unethically. China then process the bulk of the world's cobalt. There is currently no source of cobalt in North America and only Formation Metals has the environmental approvals to begin mining operations for cobalt in North America.

Once Tesla starts announcing suppliers for the Gigafactory, I expect the hype that exists for Tesla stock will extend to it's suppliers. So in addition to the increased demand for cobalt, I expect the price to increase from hype. ",23

Reference #1.ec2bf648.1422285118.ef29fd99"" or ""We're sorry. The page you are looking for is currently unavailable. Please try again.""). This morning I couldn't login to my account for 25 minutes. Even with successful login it takes up to 3 minutes delay until you finally see your portfolio page. Finally, you often get disconnected after just a few minutes  - I guess it is because their servers cannot handle that many simultaneous connections. In response to my complain I received this email response from IL support: ""our investigation shows that there was no issue related to slower than normal website responsiveness""

3. Speaking of customer support it is very bad. Half of the traders you reach on the phone barely speak English. When I reported some of the problems in my emails to support - the answers I received were either inappropriate (e.g. ""we cannot confirm your complaint looking at our server logs) or plain ignorant (""May be you should try another browser?"", ""Close the session and login again, it may help"")

4. What scares me most about being with IL is how buggy is their software. Even with such simple things like calculations of totals for market value and unrealized gains/losses. The numbers I see on my portfolio page often don't correspond to reality - I have to manually export  my portfolio page to Excel to get correct numbers. This problem is intermittent, but it occurred to me at least 4 times in the past month. 

5. In one of my accounts I actively trade in options and in the past 3 months I encountered at least 5 days when I would not be able to see bid and ask for all my options for hours. Suddenly, all bid and ask values go to zero and even when you click on the option to trade you get zero values in trading screen. As you can imagine, this is totally unacceptable for options trader as you are unable to trade without knowing what the bids and asks are.  I just love the answer I got from IL support (the screenshot was taken at the middle of the trading day and showed zeros for 15+ options, including GOOG, BX, CNQ, ENB, etc.): ""With reference to the screenshot you had provided, the prices were reported accordingly as the option holdings had $0.00 bid"". 

At this point I had enough and will be moving to another discount brokerage. It is too bad as IL used to be the best in Canada. I don't know who re-designed their interfaces a couple of years ago), but apparently it was designed and maintained so badly that they can no longer provide service to clients and they are obviously unable to fix these problems.

15-01-26,Going in $5000 on UWTI,"Ive been eyeing oil for some time now, and I've come to the decision that oil has hit the bottom, or very close to it. Should it fall even more, I will be adding more to my portfolio, but for now this is probably a safe bet. I've also examined the percentage of drop between the DowJones in 08, and now oil. They have both correlated in how much percentage has dropped from their respective highs, so at the worst, its a bad entry point, and best there is nowhere to go but up. 

At 2.68 per share, UWTI is at a fantastic price, and I can't see oil going lower than $40. I'd tell anyone to buy as well, as many analysis's did not even expect oil to reach 60. The market has probably over reacted, and oil should stabilize at 50-55 for the remainder of the year before going back to $80 where it should normally be. ",2

It is now the beginning of 2015 my friends, and I am very worried that the market will become bearish... so I am still worried about investing in stock due to ""some"" analysts concerns to a coming minor global recession.

What are your thoughts on investing at this point in time?  I am looking into buying the following stocks:
- Sprint (S) Blackberry (BBRY) for potential for buyout/merger
- Transocean (RIG) or Seadrill (SDRL) - deep water drillers will be the first to profit from the recovery of oil prices
- Markel Corporation (MKL) or Leucadia National Corporation (LUK) - they are highly diversified investment firms that follow similar investment strategies of BRK; I prefer LUK due to potential upside, but they are currently recovering from a couple of their investments
- PFE, DOW, CSX, LUV, and FCX
- Cyber security stocks such as CYBR, FTNT, FEYE (maybe PANW because its a leader, but its costly) - which will jump if any sort of government hack occurs
- Network and Data companies like SYMC or CSCO
- GE, F, JPM

15-01-26,Question about Roth Conversion,"I'm a little confused about how to calculate the tax I would owe if I were to do a Roth conversion. Here's a hypothetical scenario:

If I have 3 accounts (Roth IRA, Traditional IRA, and a 403(b) from a previous employer) and I wanted to convert a nondeductible traditional IRA, which is composed of after tax contributions (let's call this X) + earnings (let's call this Y) to a Roth, would I:

1) only owe tax on the earnings (Y) from the traditional IRA account because the contributions were after tax, or

2) owe tax based on the percentage of pretax dollars in the traditional and 403(b) combined, so something like:

taxable portion = (Y + 403b)/(X + Y + 403b)

I'm confused as to whether the 403b is treated like another IRA, and since you cant' cherry pick which contributions to convert, you have to pay tax on the percentage of the conversion equal to the percentage of pretax dollars in all your IRAs.

Thanks for you help.

Looking at their lifetime charts, all three follow a similar trajectory and history, starting in the summer of 2006. 

[Graph](http://i.imgur.com/RvsHTQA.png)

Why did these stocks open so high? 2006 was a good year for the markets, why would these new inverse indexes open at over $1,500 a share. At the height of the 2008 crash they got to around $1,800.

Of course they have all tumbled since then, currently trading below $100.

Questions:

- Does anyone know the history of these stocks, and why they opened to high?
- Were there inverse indexes prior to 2006? 
- Given that market corrections happen every 5-10 years, wouldn't going long on a inverse index eventually be profitable?
- Is there any reason that inverse indexes wouldn't rise if their respective markets tank ala 2008?
- What else should one consider in going long on an inverse index? From what I gather, inverse indexes don't suffer the same 'lose everything and more' fate that shorting a single stock does, so that minimizes risk.

15-01-27,Should you become more conservative as you approach retirement,"Sorry if this has been asked before but i couldn't find anything with a quick search.  Why is there so much conventional wisdom around getting more and more conservative with your investments as you approach?  

When I reach retirement age (say 65 for the purpose of discussion), I would hope to live another 20 years (at least).  It's not like I get to some magic age and if I have some amount of money I just win, like in a board game.  I would want to live off the interest of the money that I've saved, for the the next 20+ years.  I would think that the same mix of risk reward that has been best for the last 15 years wouldn't change.  I can understand not getting involved with very high risk (penny stock type), but I don't understand moving a high percentage of money into low risk, low reward.  

I would gladly have to dip into principal when periodic dips occur to cover living expenses, to have the grater return.  I don't see why getting close to the point where you stop contributing changes what investments you should participate in.  Whats balance of risk reward is best in a the 20 years from 35-55 still should still be best 55-75 or 65-85.

Am I missing something, is this just about peace of mind, or there something more?",1

**Background**

Last week, /u/fscomeau posted on /r/wallstreetbets, /r/options, and /r/investing about buying long FEB calls on AAPL for the upcoming earnings. Very obviously, he was down voted in /r/options and /r/investing, as it’s a little reckless.

**The Trade:**
Fscomeau bought the 110 FEB ’15 Calls x100. It started as a [$30,000 position.](http://i.imgur.com/XNeLPUj.png) Why did he do it? “Yolo.”

**The ""Analysis:""**
Two days later, he posted his [“analysis""](http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/2t8gau/why_i_gambled_31200_on_apple_earnings_a_full_and/), to mixed reviews. 

Best Reviews:
&gt;I have to say, however, your write up reeks of a shallow, almost juvenile understanding of equity analysis.

&gt;He suffers from two major basic trader follies: The need to be right driven by ego and not what the market is saying.No sensible risk management or position sizing for account size.

**His “AMA:""**
His penchant for reckless risk-taking has given him an ironic popularity among WSB. They’ve heralded him as a hero, and pushed him into [an AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/2tb0an/ama_this_weeks_rwallstreetbets_hero_ufscomeau/), which I’m fairly certain had mostly sarcastic questions, and very serious answers by “Avatar of WSB” (the hero formerly known as Fscomeau). It's very hilarious and worth a read.

It’s revealed that
&gt;I certainly have a strong stomach. I haven't slept much recently, I can maybe sleep 2-3 hours a night.

**Fastforward to Today:**
There were quite a few update posts over 7 days. One of which was him bragging about being in-the-money, and up about 30k on his options. Jokingly, a poll was posted on what fscomeau’s next step should be (sell half? double down?).

&gt; So I was looking at the poll this morning and the leading vote (at the time) on the stickied post was for ""buy more calls."" I felt bad to… I sent a limit order for a price I considered way too low and never expected it to pass. I was pleasantly surprised (I think?). 
**I'm so tired guys, nothing I say or do makes sense. I managed to sleep one hour last night and three the night before.**

When asked: 
&gt; Are you absolutely sure you can afford to lose this much?
[His answer: No.](http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/2turvc/the_textbook_definition_of_insanity/co2l34u)

He is absolutely sure that AAPL has: 
&gt;99% chance to best even Wall Street's inflated estimates
&gt;90% chance to jump 2-3%+ on earnings.

[As of now, he’s sitting in a hospital](http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/2tvfm9/going_to_the_hospital_im_really_really_really/)
 

Many traders have [gathered around web chat to discuss the earnings, feel free to join](http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/2tvibx/join_rwsb_for_live_playbyplay_discussion_of_aapl/). 



**TL;DR: There are several reasons buying volatility and buying directional options is usually a *losing* strategy for earnings. Health is another important risk to manage. This earnings season, implied volatility might not be the only thing that gets crushed.**

15-01-26,Gold - an alternative to the dollar reserves of Russia. Part 1.,"In Russia, the safest in terms of protection against economic sanctions asset in the international reserves is gold. World experience proves the reliability of gold as an international reserve.

Fluctuations in the share of gold in the international reserves are defined not only by changes in physical volumes of the precious metal, but also the dynamics of the foreign exchange component of reserves and gold prices. It should be borne in mind that in general for over a sufficiently long period of time (from 90-ies), gold prices are artificially low. In 2014 there was another artificial reduction in prices of the yellow metal in the world market (the result of market manipulation so-called golden cartel).

Uncle Sam in the early 1970s. actively destroying (or remove) the gold exchange standard (the Bretton Woods monetary system) and called on all countries to abandon the gold reserves as ""the prejudices of the past."" Even spent a few illustrative auctions due to their stocks to ""inspire"" others to sell the precious metal. However, a large effect to no avail. Since the late 1970s, the US gold reserve your longer spend. At the same time, in countries belonging to the periphery of world capitalism, the picture is quite different. Total group of countries, which are called ""emerging markets and developing countries"", on January 1, 2014 the share of gold in total international reserves amounted to only 2.7% (data from the Bank of Russia).

It is noteworthy that even in China, which fell into this group, the proportion of gold was only 1.1% (the largest gold reserves, according to official figures, 1,054 m). A few years ago in terms of the proportion of gold in the international reserves of Russia was on the average level of the group of emerging markets and developing countries. But in recent years this share in Russia began to rise

Therefore, in that year there has been a decline in the proportion of gold in the international reserves of Russia, while reducing the physical volume of metal was not, on the contrary, there was a growth of its stock. In the second half of last year, the share of gold in reserves will exceed 10%. This was due to some increase in metal prices, an increase in its stock in kind, rapid spending of the currency reserves. On 1 December 2014 the proportion of gold in international reserves exceeded 10.8%.

15-01-26,Name of microeconomic exchange participant,"Hi all,
I'm trying to remember the name of a type of participant in a microeconomics transaction. 
In general, there's the buyer, who gives money and receives an item, the seller, who give an item and receives money, and then there's this elusive participant who gives nothing but receives a secondary outcome that's related to the primary exchange activity.

Example 1: A baker makes bread every morning, the insurance agency next to the baker's shop has no direct or complementary connection, but is better off because they get to enjoy the smell of freshly baked bread in the morning.

Example 2: A store installs lamps to illuminate their parking lot to better serve their customers coming and going at night. The houses across the street now have to deal with light streaming in through their windows all night long.

What is the general term for the insurance agency and the homeowners in each of these examples? I'm trying for the life of me to figure it out but I just can't remember it.",1

15-01-26,Potential for increasing gold reserves. Part 2.,"Gold reserve for the eight-year period from 31 December 2006 to 31 December 2013 increased by 2.58 times. This is one of the highest growth of gold reserves. Perhaps equally high rates of growth of gold reserves were in China. But a very specific Chinese statistics camouflages processes of accumulation of yellow metal. The main source of growth in gold reserves of Russia is its domestic production. Within the period under review, it also grew (production increase 1.72 times).
From the middle of the last decade, Russia's leaders have stated several times that it is necessary to increase gold reserves, and by purchasing gold from our miners. It is well known that the production of ""yellow metal"" has always been a ""currency shop"" of the country. At the Russian monetary authorities (central banks and the Ministry of Finance) has a powerful capacity reserve of gold in their reserves. In 2010, reached the maximum value of the index increase gold reserves / annual production (86.4%). He then began to decline to less than 1/3 in 2013.

Final data on gold reserves for all of last year have not yet been published. The latest information on the Bank of Russia's December 1, 2014 - 1.188 m. Simple estimation shows that almost certainly as of January 1 of this year, reserves the pass through the strap 1200. Annual production of ""yellow metal"" for 2014, according to Russian Union of Gold, was approximately 280 tons. We can estimate the growth of gold reserves in the past year, it turns out 164 tons. This will be the largest annual increase since the inception of the Russian Federation. This increase in relation to the annual production can be estimated at 58.6%.

Another detail concerning the gold reserves. We mentioned above that the foreign exchange reserves of the Russian Federation are the responsibility of both the Central Bank and Ministry of Finance. The latter belong to the Reserve Fund and the National Welfare Fund. A Bank of Russia only by special agreement manages foreign exchange resources of the two funds. With gold reserves situation is different. Almost all monetary gold (only monetary gold is included in reserve) belongs to the Bank of Russia. Of 1036 tonnes of gold constituting Russia's international reserves (as of January 1, 2014), the Ministry of Finance of gold had only 23 tons, ie less than 0.1%.

In my estimation, if the monetary authorities carried out the purchase of 100 percent of the gold mined in Russia, it is only for the period 2006-2014. additional increase in the gold reserves of the country amounted to 900-950 tons. This means that on December 31, 2013, he would be equal to 1950-2000 tons. This figure exceeds the hypothetical historical highs, which was recorded in pre-revolutionary Russia (1,208 tons in 1914) and close to the historical peak of the USSR (2150 tons in 1953).

15-01-27,NVGS: A Brief Analysis,"I was taking a brief look at NVGS and wanted to write down some thoughts and see what you all thought and could contribute as well.

NVGS or Navigator Holdings is a Natural Gas tanker company that owns and operates the world’s largest fleet of handysize liquefied gas carriers. Their market share is upwards of 50% of the market they operate in. They have increased their fleet from 5 in 2000, to 23 now and have almost doubled fleet size since 2012. 

As natural gas production increases due to fracking and horizontal drilling U.S. production is approaching a need for export. LNG exports are currently legislated very tightly but reform is expected soon to open exports more broadly. This would be beneficial for U.S. natural gas companies and transport companies as natural gas in other countries can be more than twice the price of U.S. natural gas due to supply issues. As exports become more common we should expect global prices to reach an equilibrium probably lower than they are.

NVGS has on paper performed excellently. They are profitable with very strong margins and are trading at what seems to be a reasonable value given the decrease in oil prices is not as big of an impact on their business as the market estimates. Currently they have a market cap of $950M, Revenue of $297.8M (TTM), and Income of $71.1M. This has given them a TTM P/E of 10.5 as the market contraction has affected them (but so far not their profitability or sales increases), and a forward P/E of 8.27. NVGS' PEG ratio is 1.17 and it's P/S ratio is 3.19. NVGS is also not trading at a significant premium to tangible book value at 1.22x however as we know these assets become significantly discounted in a commodity crash environment and in a crisis we should not expect a 1:1 conversion into cash. Assuming a 40% depreciation for a fire sale situation it is trading at a still reasonable 1.7x salvageable book value. This gives a relative valuation cushion. NVGS does have significant debt with $440M of long term debt or 6.1x net income, however even at current depressed prices it's debt to equity is only 0.56. Liquidity concerns are valid with a quick and current ratio of only 1.0 but margins remain strong dousing concerns somewhat.

In terms of revenue and income growth EPS this year has grown 58.9% YoY and is expected to grow at a 31% pace next year and 9% over the next 5 years. Sales for the quarter YoY were up 25% at a brisk pace. Margins as stated are currently quite healthy with 53.3% gross, 34.5% operating, and 23.9% profit. NVGS does not currently pay a dividend and hopefully will shore up it's balance sheet before deciding to do so but eventually should have the potential for a solid yield as it's earnings yield (the amount per share that is net income and can be paid out as dividend assuming an unreasonable 100% payout ratio) is 7.63%. If NVGS shores up it's balance sheet and earnings grow as expected next year that would be an 8.25% earnings yield, at a 50% payout ratio that would garner a yield of 4.17%, at a more conservative payout ratio of 35% that would still yield 2.88% off of the current price.

The current state of the company seems very healthy but yet the price is depressed. When I see this usually I feel cautious, the market sees something I don't (potentially). There are risks to the business that aren't reflected in the past that may come up in the future. The current ones I see that are most worrying to me are as follows.

1. Natural Gas price is very volatile, especially of late, and is currently depressed. Not as badly as Oil but still there is a significant decline. The largest immediate impact to the business will be natural gas prices. It is a complex issue, as if they remain high globally tankers will have an incentive to export from an area of cheap prices (the U.S.) to other locations, but in the long run this should bring all gas prices to an equilibrium weighted based off of natural gas usage and cost of transit. So while lower natural gas prices in the U.S. would seem negative for this stock I'm not quite certain that's true. It seems the ideal situation for productivity is low U.S. natural gas, legislative easing of regulation, and high global prices.

2. Oil tanker situation - A potential similar situation happened with oil tanker companies. There was a very large and growing market for oil tankers so many companies put in large orders for more tankers, this created a massive oversupply and many companies had to lower rates, sell off parts, or go bankrupt. Most have not recovered. If NVGS is caught up in a production war competing for market share it may end up reducing competitive advantage and pricing power.

3. Finally a minor issue but at a glance this just appears worrying. The company has very few employees with only 22 listed employees. Why is this? This is a shockingly little amount of employees for a $950M company and reflects income of $3.2M per employee which is very high and if legitimate is very healthy.

What do you all think? I have only taken a brief look but it seemed worth diving deeper and I wanted to share because I would love if this subreddit became people doing analysis on stocks instead of pitching vanguard index funds for the passive investing crowd only. I welcome any criticism or comments!

15-01-27,Renting part of your house or basement long term,"Every other Monday, we look at real estate as a way to make money. I have explained why I believe real estate is one of the best ways to grow wealth, and gone over a check list for first time investors. Today, we look at doing with what you already have, that is renting part of your house or your basement to a new tenant.

 

Being a live in landlord
 

Being a live in landlord has a lot of perks. First, you are on the property first hand, so you can see if in spite of you tenant’s background check, something is still off. A tenant who is good on paper can be noisy, put a lot of wear and tear on your property by slamming the doors, or try to sneak in a pet in spite of your no pet policy. By living on the property, you can straighten things up from the start. Chances are “bad” tenants will avoid you from the start, and only good tenants will move in.

I have lived with two roommates in a place I owned and it was much better, at least for me, than the previous houseshares I had lived in with no landlord around. The landlord would come once a quarter, take days to fix something, and no one would care about the property. With a live in landlord, people behave better, and the landlord is there to solve any problem. The property should be in better shape, as no landlord likes to live in a dump.

The thing I liked the most as a live in landlady was that you could evict the tenant with no notice. In the UK the rules are pretty strict about tenant protection if you rent the whole property. But if you live there, you just have to change the locks and put the tenant’s stuff outside your property, and you are good. I never did it, but on every interview, I made sure the tenant understood it was a possibility if they were late on rent or started damaging the property. I don’t know if the threat deterred the worst tenants but I never had a problem.

 

 

Setting the rent of your property
 

If you bought your main residence, you probably have a mortgage, and have had to put a good chunk of money down. You may even have opted for a 15 years mortgage or be making extra payments to pay it off faster. If your normal mortgage was $1,000 a month but you are paying $3,000, it doesn’t mean that your tenant has to pay half of that.

You need to align with the market prices for similar properties. On Craigslist and other ad boards, you can find the rates to rent a bedroom in a houseshare, and a basement or attic with independent access. To make a faire comparison with the market you need to compare all the amenities you are offering.

 

- Will the tenant just have access to a room or also living room and kitchen?

- Will the tenant be able to use your washer and dryer?

- Are you renting furnished or unfurnished?

- Is the entrance separate or through your living room?

- Will the tenant have a parking space?

- What bills are you including?

- Are taxes and insurance included too?

- Are you offering a peer to peer relationship, say you are in your mid 20s taking on other college kids or young professionals, or is it your family house and you take in a boarder who won’t be able to choose what movie to watch on TV tonight?

 

In my property, I have opted for an all inclusive rate. Everyone is happy, the tenants because the do not need to budget for the bills every month, they know exactly what their housing costs will be, and me because I don’t have to make complicated calculations to split the bills, send each of them a recap counting pennies, and get bitter if they spend too much time in the shower or do laundry too often.

 

Day to day living with a tenant
 

If the tenant lives in a room inside your property, you want to set clear rules from the start. When is it ok to make noise, can he have company over, can company stay the night, how many nights maximum before it becomes double occupancy and both have to pay rent, etc.

Imagine an abusive little brother crashing at your place for months, what would you like to tell him from day 1? Tell that to your tenant FROM DAY 1. After you become friends or discover you can’t stand each other, communication will be harder. How do you tell a friend to do dishes? To clean after himself? Give them a copy of house rules when they move in, and talk as soon as there is a problem.

Set boundaries about rooms the tenant cannot go into, it is better if each person has a key to his or her room to avoid problems, and a shelf in the kitchen, fridge and bathroom. Make space for them so they feel welcome but define your space too.

 

Attic, basement and separate unit
 

This is the best of both worlds. Instead of having to supervise a rental property far from home, you have it right above or under you, yet your tenants do not invade your space. Maybe your driveway and garden, but you will have set rules for that in your contract as well. Renting a separate unit counts as a full tenancy, and the live in landlord eviction rights do not apply. One more reason to be very thorough with your tenant’s background check.

Be discreet and leave them space, but also keep an eye for any suspect behavior, extra people staying overnight too often, are they living there, are they keeping the property in good shape, etc.

NEVER, ever even start thinking about grabbing an extra key and checking the inside of their property while they are away. It is illegal in many places and the tenant could sue you. If you have a doubt, ask nicely if they would let you in for an inspection, and if not, what is their reason.

Having them close is also very convenient to chase late payments.",1

This is a huge advantage over autologous stem cells (grown from each individual patient's own blood or bone marrow stem cells over a number of weeks before being re-administered to the same patient).


Their [publications](http://www.athersys.com/publications.cfm) show their progress in researching how Multistem affects mice's, then humans' neurovasculature. One really interesting aspect of the treatment is the way it reduces the action of the [spleen](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2680137/) following ischemic stroke. The damage imposed by splenic involvement in the aftermath of ischemic stroke is not well studied and not commonly known by most healthcare professionals. Its been shown in mice that it does [decrease inflammatory response](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3546881/).


Now the outcome for human patients after receiving this treatment will be better known after the conclusion of their phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical trial. It [finished enrolling](http://www.athersys.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=888959) on December 29, 2014 and is due to report preliminary results around the end of the first quarter, [""give or take some weeks""](http://edge.media-server.com/m/p/mzeprgqb)&lt;== (Check 21:45 on this link to hear all about the study from Athersys President and COO B.J. Lehman). There are 126 patients enrolled: 65 being treated, and 61 placebo patients. This is a pivotal trial and should show if there is any efficacy for their product, and its extent.


If this trial fails to show efficacy, so then fails the hype that follows them and their share price, though they still may produce some useful products or technologies that they or another company may one day use to the benefit of humankind.



Basically, the excitement around them from an investing standpoint is happening **right now**. Barring an explosion inside of one of their research labs, the ATHX share price will rise leading into the results of this trial being reported. If the trial is positive the price will JUMP.",1

15-01-28,Argument Against Divestment,"Throwaway account since I actively participate in this sub and this is outside of the scope of my normal posts.

The college that I attended has a subset of students actively pushing for the school's endowment to divest from fossil fuel companies as a perceived boycott against global warming caused by fossil fuels, blah blah blah. I think it's a stupid argument to make on a moral level, but I want to focus on the fact that it's not going to have any financial impact and would actually constrain the endowment's investing activities. Below are my thoughts on why it's a stupid financial decision, but am curious if there is anything that I am missing.

1) Does not directly impact the Company as you would only be selling share on the secondary market.

2) Severely limits investment options: (i) if the moral argument is to divest completely from oil, coal, etc. companies then you would also have to sell holdings in index funds / mutual funds that hold these positions and (ii) these companies make up a sizable chunk of the overall equity market and divesting would hamper diversification.

3) Tax implications? Not sure how school endowments are structured from a tax perspective so would be curious if anyone has any insight here.

4) One could make the argument that by divesting you actually lose your shareholder voice and ability to make any change via proxy voting (but we all know that one endowment's investment isn't going to be material to that process anyways).

5) Other angles that I'm missing?",1

I look at seeking alpha out of curiosity, yahoo finance for its interface, however, I haven't found a place that gives me  a nice focus on tsx only.  I find tsx companies can get drown out by nyse unless you know exactly what company your looking for.

With the cdn dollar dropping do you adapt your investing choices, focus on tsx, or business as usual?

I'm a fairly new investor, learned a few tough lessons on stocks, and now looking for relative safety with a few etfs to become more balanced.  I just feel worried about buying into the American market with the cdn dollar at .81.  Historically .81 isn't necessarily a poor exchange so maybe I'm just spoiled by the more favorable exchange rate seen in the last few years.

One of the Canadian etfs I was looking at was xtr.to https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=XTR.TO  
I know there are no fee etfs but this seems to offer a fairly reliable return with a small fee of .56% annually.  I also like the asset mix as I feel that lower commodities prices will increase profit for utilities who will not lower rates significantly.

15-01-27,"After 10 years of investment grade rating from S &amp; P lost again","On Monday, after the close of trading, the rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded the sovereign credit rating of the Russian Federation to the ""speculative"" level ""BB +"". This event was to be expected in view of the growing geopolitical risks. Back in April last year SnP downgraded to 'BBB-' - this is a step up speculative. And in December, put on a downward revision to the ""negative"" outlook.

SnP first drew attention to Russia nearly 20 years ago - in 1996. Then the agency assigned the country rating of ""BB-"" - lower level of speculative category. And soon the default level was, in fact, Russia and defaulted. In 2005 alone, the state reached the level of investment according to the agency, and 10 years later lose it again.

The other two international rating agencies will review Russia's sovereign rating in 2-3 months and is likely to also lower it to the ""speculative"" category. According to investment declarations, while two of the three agencies continue to hold an investment grade rating, foreign funds have the right to invest in a variety of debt instruments of the country.

  All negativity from the downgrade again it will feel the Russian currency, but the stock market this event virtually invisible. On Tuesday, the Russian ruble may find support at around 69-70 against the dollar. Do not forget that in the event of a downgrade of Russia two of the three rating agencies, with Russian companies can be claimed repayment of debts in the amount of 25-30 billion. Dollars. Also do not forget that in the case of a downgrade of the Russian Federation for one more step, a country may be excluded from the international index of MSCI. The remaining two agencies also follow the example of SnP- is only a matter of time. Unfortunately, yesterday's decision SnP looks more political than fundamental, but there is also a good point - trumps for threats and blackmail the United States is becoming less.

We are waiting for a negative opening on ruble MICEX index with losses in the range of 1% and the RTS index with losses of 3-4%.

http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=521848&amp;page=7


&gt; I was buying short tearm options through SAXO bank trade floor. Initaly I was working with 20 000 USD, last morning 12:00 I fell to 16000 usd and I couldnt withdraw it from the account. After that they recalculated my loss and said that I am -400 000 usd, and a bit later -560 000 USD, and that I haver to cover that Loss in the next couple of months ???????!!!!!


and another one here 

&gt;I am in the same case. My account is showing a 6 digits negative number. Do you know what to do ? I am student and i dont have the funds necessary to make up for that loss. Do you think you can contest it ?


And yet another one



&gt;I am a retail trader with SAXO Bank and they too also have asked me to pay a 6 figure sum to them due to negative balance.
They originally close me out around 1.15 taking all my margin.. then they called me the next day saying they adjusted the price and now I should pay a very very large sum.. I don't have this money and infarct i lose my life savings here.. 

Quite gory. Very interesting read. Maybe because of the schadenfreude. Maybe because you learn from other peoples mistakes.",12

15-01-28,"[Tax Optimizing Hypothetical] I have already realized a $1,182 loss. If I take a $1,182 Short Term gain, plus a $1,182 Long Term gain, will I pay the Long Term of Short Term capital gains rate on my taxes?","I want to sell some stocks, but I can choose LT or ST tax lots. I'd rather get rid of some ST tax lots, if it's all the same. Cancelling out the loss with ST tax lots seems like an opportunity to do that. I only want to pay LT capital gains tax.

The $1,182 loss is carryover LT loss from 2012.

I don't know if you can choose which gain lots cancel the carryover loss on your tax forms though. 

If I can't choose, then I'm not going to realize more than $1,182 worth of gains this year. That way I can be sure it only cancels ST lots.

EDIT: cuethebownboats' link seems to have the answer. Because it's an LT loss, it will net against LT gains first then ST gains. Looks like I can't realize more than $1,182 in gains this year, or else I'm paying more in tax than if I wait until next year.",0

15-01-28,Australian Dividend momentum strategy trades - CFDs positions worth ~95-100k,"I've traded this mostly systematic strategy for almost two years now on the ASX. It takes advantage of the well known fact that stocks rise ahead of their ex-dividend date. 

However, in Australia, we still have dividend imputations or franking credits whereby the company can pay tax on part of the dividend and you the holder receive a tax refund after you put in your returns. 

Investors, pensioner funds, local institutional holders take advantage of this and buy up big for the yield. I simply follow the rising tide, if my momentum indicator triggers a buy on a high yield stock. I sell if it falls too quickly before ex dividend, indicating not enough buyers for the yield to offset other facts causing it to fall. I literally use like 2 indicators in total. 

While I sometimes get whipsawed just to have to come back again, because I usually buy almost a month before ex, and because of the local tax incentives and insane search for yield now that we're in a global currency war, I have a high win rate and payout ratio. Max drawdown so far is only -9%, historical backtesting has reached 15%. I also only trade the ASX50, or top 50 large cap stocks on the Aussie market. 

Anyway, this may not be quite YOLO as some people, but it is for me as I've hit maximum asset allocation. Trades either opened yesterday or today, apart from Telestra which I bought about a week ago as it is THE most popular dividend stock and CBA on friday, which activated a bit earlier than everyone else. 

Screenshot is all I really have for proof: http://i.imgur.com/9478ekc.png

The nil paid rights is crap from my last trades. 

I'll update in a month if I'm not stopped out, which would be the biggest drawdown since I've started.

15-01-28,Weekly reports that heavily weigh the pricing of WTI Crude Oil.,"I don't know if I am preaching to the choir or not, but I wanted to give you two sources of information I watch to make my own decisions of the oil prices, specifically US oil due to our recent surge of market shares from the Shale Boom.
First, every Wednesday, at 9:30 AM Central, the US Energy Information Administration reports weekly figures on crude oil inventories. The last two weeks show that supply is still on the rise, which is causing the oil prices to go down. Please note that this report lags by a week.

http://www.eia.gov/petroleum/supply/weekly/

Another report worth mentioning is the rig count provided by Baker Hughes. The North American rig count is released weekly at noon central time on Fridays. The international rig count is released on the fifth working day of each month.

http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=79687&amp;p=irol-reportsother

The US is making the required rig cuts to reduce supply (287 rigs since Dec), however due to the lag of production yield, we are still seeing a supply influx. The lag of supply decrease is evident. Many people are monitoring the supply to wait to see that inevitable decrease in production before they dip their tows in the water.

Again this is my own speculation, I work in the industry and currently enrolled in a masters program for Petroleum Engineering. I hope this information helped someone, sorry if it is common knowledge!",53

Is it better to have a better but more expensive rates or is it better to save on commission rates? For example, according to Top Ten Reviews OptionsHouse has very, very good rates but it doesn't offer foreign trading (which is something I'm eccentrically interested in as a defense investor despite the risk and difficulty obtaining information). On the other hand, optionsXpress offers foreign trading but is significantly more expensive in their commission rates. My priority is definitely market options so I'm going to bite the bullet and go with optionsXpress.

Frankly I could've already made 20% on $20k then another ~ 20% on that based on what I've been looking at. My strategy, which seems like a fine idea to the beginner in me, will be to buy stocks that I believe will increase by 10-20%+ after a steep drop, sell once it reaches that target, and repeat. However, what I've read thus far seems to suggest that this type of short-term buying and selling will end up being a losing strategy. Experienced stock experts of Reddit, is this a plan that will yield the results I'm expecting?

I.e. 

- Stock A begins to drop, purchase $20k at its 1-year low.

- Sell once stock A increases 10-20% based on stagnaity of the stock. 

-  Purchase $24k of stock B using same method above.

Repeating this once a month would yield me a ballooning $2k-4k/month. Is there real merit behind short-term buying-and-selling not being a wise venture?",4

Basically he considers how investing can be more than about pure profit, and (in my own words) a financial vote on social matters. Socially responsible investing is *not* investing in ""bad"" companies like tobacco or oil commodities (if you think like that). Impact investing is a more direct, affirmative vote by actually investing in companies that do good. The catch is that you're expected to make a slightly smaller yield off these stocks than a typical profit-driven company, and some people are OK with that. 
  
I just think that PR is so important today that this is only going to be more common. This has been called [Corporate Social Responsibility](http://www.amazon.com/Corporate-Social-Responsibility-Doing-Company/dp/0471476110) (CSR) before, but that's more of a political term.

15-01-29,Best way to recover from a bad investment decision?,"Hi. I made a very bad decision last week and am looking for advice on how to fix it/cut my losses. I am a new mom and a nurse so money is very tightly budgeted. In the past few months I have developed (I think) bad postpartum depression. Very bad. There is no money for therapy and medication that would (possibly) be necessary so I did something very stupid. I sunk my $1200 paycheck into OCN. It is spiraling the drain so fast I don't know what to do. I got a tip from someone I trusted that it would go up and I gambled. 

I was trying to do the right thing and I know now it very, very negligent. So my question is, what is the most responsible thing to do now? Do I sell it at the loss and just keep working towards saving for the therapy or do I hold on for a few weeks/months to see if it goes back up (at least to the price point I purchased it at)?

I'd like to concentrate on small, unlisted companies in Central and Eastern Europe.

I've figured out the legal issues from the European side but haven't been able to find much on what the requirements of actually doing this with a USA registered business (I'm a US citizen as are they) are.

I'm not even 100% sure if this would constitute a hedge fund or something else, though as there'd be less than 10 million USD, I wouldn't have to register with the SEC at least. Everything seems geared towards working the stock market and assisting clients with that, but this wouldn't interact with anything listed so...

15-01-29,"Savoring the small victories; A Report of in Working as an Activist Investor","A few weeks back, the present employee managers at GT Advanced Technologies put forward an incentivization plan that included a cash bonus for selling the Company's valuable ASF (Sapphire Crystal Growth) Furnaces and hitting R&amp;D &amp; CAPEX targets.  

The plan they submitted had multiple problems which I pointed out in the objection I filed (viewable here)  

Each problem arose from the criteria for qualifying for said bonus which the Managers put into the plan,  

1. They sought bonuses on total revenues for Sapphire Furnaces sold (which means they could have sold the Furnaces far below market value, producing no value for the business, and still hit their bonus criteria)  

2. They seek bonuses for hitting R&amp;D and CAPEX Targets or lower (i.e. cutting expenses, the major problem with their R&amp;D and CAPEX targets is that the Company is already scheduled to experience significant reductions on these Criteria because they've completed developing on their major Hyperion 4 product)  

I laid out the problems in more detail in the objection linked above.  

Since my objection, the managers were forced to file a new incentivization plan. The employee manager's new plan is still a self-serving piece of crap, but at least the first one was laid to rest.  

This one will have to bite the dust as well.

15-01-29,Mortgage for rental vs REITs on margin,"How ridiculous of an idea is it to invest in real estate using ""other people's money"" through buying REITs on margin? 

Interest rates for mortgages look to be about half that of margin loans for similar principal amounts. 

For a rental property: property insurance, property tax, property management fees, repair and upkeep costs as well as vacancies would eat into the return of the rental property.

For a REIT: management fees (low), and a higher interest rate on borrowed money are what's working against you. I'll assume 2% dividend for a REIT per quarter with a 7%APR margin loan, the dividends per quarter should be enough to pay for the loan payments. 

I'd like to put together some numbers to actually run and compare but I wanted to run it  by you all to see if this idea even has merit, and what factors I may have missed.",1

15-01-29,"Meet the Man Who's Gunning for Amazon. For Jet.com, giving away equity to lure new users and 'Doing to Amazon What Costco Did to Walmart'","Marc Lore, the former founder of Diapers.com, is finally saying how Jet intends on beating Amazon.com when it opens up shop next month.

Jet will be part-Amazon and part-Costco, offering reduced prices to those willing to pay $50 a year for access to the marketplace.

Jet.com anticipates selling just about everything that Amazon does — clothes, books, and electronics, baby goods and athletic gear. But unlike Amazon, which is free for anyone to use, customers will be expected to pay a membership fee after a 90-day trial expires. In return, Jet is claiming to offer prices that are 10 to 15 percent lower than anywhere else.

Jet explains that it can offer lower prices because it only plans to make money on membership fees — it does not take a percentage of any of the sales. The company also said savings will come from making the process more transparent to the consumer, and offering more ways to save money. Such options may include combining multiple orders into a single shipment. Customers will save even more if they are willing to pay with a debit card, which collects fewer transaction fees than a credit card. Items that are found locally will also cost less than those that are shipped across the country.

Jet opens for private testing later this month and now offers FREE membership for early signup by using this unique link https://jet.com/#/ji/crgs4",0

Anyways, the building costs $300,000, and I only have $125,000. I'm wondering if anyone knows of a way I could raise another $200,000 from investors online (I'm thinking $25,000 for some minor renovations), which would in turn receive either a percentage of the profits or a fixed income bond.

15-01-30,Buy-to-let in the UK: a beginner’s guide to becoming a landlord,"With mortgages continuing to be out of reach for many first time buyers, and the UK rental market continuing to grow, there’s never been a better time to become a landlord.

 

Below we share with you some of the key things you need to consider before creating your own property empire.

 

Location, location, location
 

As Kirsty and Phil have been telling us for several years, buying a property is all about the location, and this is perhaps even more important for buy-to-let properties.

 

Not only do you need to make sure the property is in a desirable area but you also need to think about transport links, schools and outside space. Renters can be very choosey and ensuring you pick the right house will ensure the amount of time that the property is empty is kept to a minimum.

 

Another key point to consider is the clientele of the area. If you’re in the heart of a student area, rental income is likely to be lower. There’s nothing wrong with that, just don’t go out and buy a penthouse and kit it out with high end furniture!

 

Keep it legal
 

When renting property in the UK it is important that you meet certain safety standards.

 

The two main requirements are that the property and your tenants have a gas safety certificate that’s updated annually, and an Energy Performance Certificate.

 

There are also rules and regulations associated with treating damp, maintenance, fire safety and much more. If you’re renting your property through an agency they will be able to help you with this, if not it may be worth while consulting a solicitor.

 

Picking your tenant
 

Getting good tenants into your property can sometimes be the hardest part of the whole process.

 

You need to ensure that they are trustworthy and will look after your property, pay rent on time and keep up any maintenance such as garden work and general cleaning.

 

Unfortunately there’s no tried and tested method for picking your tenants. Sometimes you don’t have the luxury of picking a tenant, you just need someone who will pay the bills!

 

But if you can, you should always ask for references from current employers and previous landlords. If tenants are unwilling to give these details it could be better to avoid them.

 

Plan for the worst
 

Not to put a dampener on things, but you should always plan for the worst when it comes to renting property. Never rely on the income and always keep some funds for repairs, maintenance and any times when the property is empty.

 

Although being a landlord can be a tiring process the rewards can be huge. As long as you get good tenants you could have a nice income stream for years to come, and once your mortgage is paid off you have a free house!

 

 

This guest post was written on behalf of Ashley Park Debt Solutions who specializes in consolidation loans, IVAs, debt management plans and other financial solutions.

 

Editor’s note: I have been a landlady in a student town for five years, and a way I have found to increase my rental income was to rent each room separately. I also include all bills and pay them myself, so the tenants know exactly how much they can budget for housing costs. All the furniture was bought second hand or from cheap stores, and the small surplus each month is kept to cover the bills should a room stay empty. Having a contract for each room, the chances they will all be empty at the same time is lower. And the tenants screen potential new roommates before I make a final decision, to ensure they get along.

In their jargon it isn't clear what the functional difference between

* Limit Order 
* Stop Quote Order
* Stop Quote Limit Order

I think all can be used to protect a gain.  I am focused on the impacts to sell orders.



Types of Stocks/ETFs orders include: 

Market Order – An immediate order to be executed at the prevailing market price. 

Limit Order – A conditional order to buy or sell, but only at a certain price, in an attempt to protect a potential profit or minimize a loss. Buy limit orders are entered with instructions to place the trade at or below a certain price. Likewise, sell limit orders contain instructions to execute the trade at or above a specific price. 

Stop Quote Order –Investors generally use a stop quote order to either limit a loss or protect a gain on a security. A sell stop quote order is placed at a stop price below the current market price and will trigger if the national best bid quote is at or lower than the specified stop price. A buy stop quote order is placed at a stop price above the current market price and will trigger if the national best offer quote is at or higher than the specified stop price. Once triggered, a stop quote order becomes a market order (buy or sell, as applicable), and execution prices can deviate significantly from the specified stop price. 

Stop Quote Limit Order – If Investors generally use a stop quote limit order to either limit a loss or protect a gain on a security. A stop quote limit order combines the features of a stop quote order and a limit order. A sell stop quote limit order is placed at a stop price below the current market price and will trigger if the national best bid quote is at or lower than the specified stop price. A buy stop quote limit order is placed at a stop price above the current market price and will trigger if the national best offer quote is at or higher than the specified stop price. Once triggered, a stop quote limit order becomes a limit order (buy or sell, as applicable) at a specified limit price, and execution may not occur as the market price can move away from the specified limit price.",1

I read about this last night and I've decided that I'd like to make this bet. I have about $500 that I'd be ok with losing for the potential upside.

I don't trade options or forex, so I have no idea where the first place to start is. Essentially, I'd like to short the Saudi Arabia Riyal.

Here's the heart of the investment thesis, from the article:

""Guggenheim Partners LLC, which manages $220 billion, is about to start betting against the currency of the United Arab Emirates, the dirham, said Scott Minerd, chairman of investments and global chief investment officer at the firm. Guggenheim also is considering betting against the Saudi Arabian riyal and on an appreciating Danish krone, he said.

The currencies don’t float freely, meaning that officials in each country peg the currency’s value to another currency such as the dollar or euro. Therefore, those bearish bets depend on policy makers changing course. The central banks of these countries haven’t given any indication they are considering removing the pegs, and some economists and investors doubt they ever will.

Still, Guggenheim believes the trades, which use options to place their bets, could be a home run rarely seen since the days of the financial crisis. Guggenheim could score more than $1.5 billion of profit if the trades work out, while its potential losses are capped at about $30 million, Mr. Minerd saIid.

“The upside is more than 20 to 50 times the initial investment,” based on 12-month options the firm will purchase, assuming the U.A.E. devalues its currency, Mr. Minerd said.""",0

From what I understand short term and long term distributions occur when the fund manager sells securities that make up the fund and then distributes the money equally among the fund owners.

What I don't really understand is the Return of Capital distribution. From what I do understand it's when the fund returns some of your original/all investment back to you. What in the world is the purpose of this and is it beneficial to me as an investor? ",0

* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)
* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)

Well, what these people don't realize is many retirement accounts have some position in Oil so we all suffer when this happens. 

Not only that but Oil companies donate to charities and social programs so when they take a hit guess what they are probably going to cut first?

15-01-30,Inqora- An alternative,"
I’ve been a frequenter of this subreddit for some time now, and over the months people have been saying it’s too focused on “safe” investments. Some investors would like to see more discussions about security analysis, something this sub has been visibly lacking in quantity and quality. The other subs like /r/securityanalysis, /r/investmentclub, etc. are inactive with little potential. 

I’ve made something called [Inqora](https://inqora.com/new.html)  that is more centralized and organized in a sense where users have the option of finding specific securities like Apple or GM to talk about with other investors. 

We are releasing our revamped version in February and we added a new addition of an Incentive System where investors can exchange points for money. That’s right, it works like having your karma being exchanged for money. Your contribution to our community will be rewarded with cash! We have 7000+ members now and growing. 

Sign up for details about our release!

-subscription system

-investment community

-more focused pages

-material design

-incentive system

	-exchange points for cash

-hold or sell from virtual portfolio

The CME is also changing the deliveriable basket for the June5,Sep5 and Dec5 contracts.

Details are here: https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/files/mar-15-jun-15-roll-analysis.pdf
